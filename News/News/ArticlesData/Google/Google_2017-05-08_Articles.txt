The smart speaker from Amazon is leading the pack right now. Photo from Amazon WASHINGTON, US – Amazon has grabbed more than two-thirds of the fast-growing market in the US for connected speakers with its family of Alexa-powered Echo devices, a survey showed Monday. The survey by research firm eMarketer found Amazon's Echo speakers held 70.6% of the US market, compared with 23.8% for Google Home and 5.6% for others including Lenovo, LG, Harman Kardon and Mattel. The report said 35.6 million Americans will use a voice-activated assistant device at least once a month this year, a jump of 128.9% over last year. The research firm said it expects Amazon's market share to fall slightly in the coming years but that the online retail giant will remain the dominant player in the category for the foreseeable future. "Consumers are becoming increasingly comfortable with the technology, which is driving engagement," said Martín Utreras, vice president of forecasting at eMarketer. "As prices decrease and functionality increases, consumers are finding more reasons to adopt these devices." Amazon does not disclose sales figures for its speakers, which are powered by artificial intelligence and can serve as connected home hubs. But analysts at Consumer Intelligence Research Partners (CIRP) estimate that 10.7 million Americans have purchased an Amazon Echo device since its late-2014 introduction. Awareness of Amazon Echo increased dramatically in the past year, and Echo owners use it as a voice-responsive Internet query device and household controller, in addition to a streaming music speaker, according to CIRP. The CIRP report said 52% of the Amazon devices sold were the low-priced Echo Dot, which retails for around $50. – Rappler.com Filed under:Amazon Echo•Google•Google Home•connected speakers•internet of things•smart speakers•Amazon HOW DOES THIS STORY MAKE YOU FEEL?

At least eight civilians were killed on both sides in fighting that began when a Pakistani census team accompanied by soldiers visited disputed villages along the southern border on Friday. Pakistan inherited its 2,400—kilometre border with its western neighbour when it gained independence from Britain in 1947, but Afghanistan has never formally recognised it. And while official Afghan maps reflect the so-called “Durand Line”, many nationalists believe the true border of their country ends at the River Indus that runs though Pakistan and gave India its name. “Officials from the geological survey departments of the two countries will conduct a survey, and they will also make use of Google Maps,” said a senior Pakistani security source in Islamabad who requested anonymity. Abdul Razeq, the police chief of Afghanistan’s Kandahar province, added: “After negotiations, both sides have agreed that a geological survey should be conducted. “Technical teams of both countries will use GPS and Google Maps as well as other means to get the answer.” Internet firm Google complies with local laws in certain countries that compel it to show borders in line with national demands. In 2010 Google was embroiled in a Central American border dispute that saw two neighbouring countries dispatch troops and heavily armed police to their joint border. The incident happened after a Nicaraguan commander cited Google’s version of the border map in an interview with Costa Rican newspaper La Nacion to justify a raid on a disputed area of Costa Rica. Google later said it had made a mistake and corrected its map to reflect one sanctioned by the US State Department. Pakistan last year began trying to harden the traditionally soft border with Afghanistan through trenching and fencing, but its efforts were met with hostility from Kabul. Ethnic Pashtuns living in the region have traditionally paid it little heed. Villages straddling the frontier have mosques and houses with one door in Pakistan and another in Afghanistan. Pakistani forces yesterday elevated their rhetoric when they said they had also killed “more than 50 soldiers” in last week’s border clashes — a claim quickly rejected by Kabul, which said it lost two soldiers.

At least eight civilians were killed on both sides in fighting that began when a Pakistani census team accompanied by soldiers visited disputed villages along the southern border on Friday. Pakistan inherited its 2,400-kilometer border with its western neighbor when it gained independence from the British Empire in 1947, but Afghanistan has never formally recognized the frontier. And while official Afghan maps reflect the so-called ‘Durand Line’, many nationalists believe the true border of their country ends at the River Indus that runs though Pakistan and gave India its name. A senior Pakistani security source in Islamabad who requested anonymity said: “Officials from the geological survey departments of the two countries will conduct a survey, and they will also make use of Google Maps.” A second official in Quetta confirmed the sides had agreed to a survey. Internet firm Google complies with local laws in certain countries that compel it to show borders in line with national demands — for instance, its Indian site shows the entirety of disputed Kashmir as being controlled by India. In Pakistan, however, the site shows the internationally-recognized de facto border, the Line of Control, marked with a dotted line to denote it is disputed. Attempts by Pakistan to harden the traditionally soft border with Afghanistan through trenching and fencing that began in 2016 have been met with hostility by Kabul. Ethnic Pashtuns living in the region have traditionally paid it little heed, with villages straddling the frontier that have mosques and houses with one door in Pakistan and another in Afghanistan. Pakistani forces on Sunday elevated their rhetoric when they said they had also killed “more than 50 soldiers” in last week’s border clashes — a claim quickly rejected by Kabul, which said it lost two troops. In an unrelated development, a bomb exploded outside a girls’ school in northwestern Pakistan early Monday, wounding two police officers but injuring no students as classes had not yet begun, authorities said. The bomb at the school in a suburb of Peshawar, capital of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, detonated as a counter-terrorism police vehicle drove by, officials said. “Two counter terrorism department personnel were wounded in the IED (improvise explosive device),” Peshawar police chief Mohammad Tahir said. A second device was found nearby but was defused, he said. The blast damaged the main gate of the school and some walls inside, Tahir added. No group has yet claimed the responsibility for the attack, but Taliban militants opposed to girls’ education have bombed hundreds of school in the northwest and tribal areas bordering Afghanistan. Peshawar, which has suffered for years from militancy and unrest, was the site of Pakistan’s deadliest ever attack, a Taliban assault on an army-run school in 2014 that left more than 150 people dead, most of them children. — AFP Share this: Print Email Tweet Related SHARE Facebook Twitter tweet Previous articleADB delivering effectively to raise development finance for achieving targets in Asia, Pacific Webmaster RELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR India bans medical visas for Pakistan May, June to be hottest months in Pakistan this year Britain publishes long-awaited air pollution plan Digital Newspaper Cartoon My Tweets Management Founder: Zahid Malik Editor-in-Chief: Faisal Zahid Malik Executive Editor: Gauhar Zahid Malik Editor Social Diary: Sadia Zahid Malik E-Mail : socialdiarymag@gmail.com magazinesocialdiary@hotmail.com Resident Editor Lahore: Khalid Butt E-Mail: obslhr@pakobserver.net Resident Editor Peshawar: Tariq Saeed E-Mail: obspwr@pakobserver.net Group Director : Khurram Jaffrani E-Mail: khurram_jaffrani@hotmail.com Director Marketing : Naveed Ahmad Khan Cell # 0300-5129008 Contact Us Online Edition : Q Malik / Ch Imran Zafar E-Mail: webmaster@pakobserver.net Islamabad: 051-2852027, 051-2852028 E-Mail : observer@pakobserver.net Karachi: 021-35308446-49 E-Mail : obskhi@pakobserver.net Lahore: 042-36306666, 36303333 E-Mail : obslhr@pakobserver.net Home e-Paper Social Diary CPEC Health Voice of People © Send to Email Address Your Name Your Email Address Cancel Post was not sent - check your email addresses!

The Galaxy S8 and the Galaxy S8 Plus, which were launched in India a few weeks ago, are no different. These are Samsung's top Android phones and they come with cameras that are supposed to be best in the class. We reviewed the two phones several days ago and found that they click absolutely fantastic images. There is no doubt that these are the best Samsung phones when it comes to clicking pictures. But that brings up the question? Is the Galaxy S8 also the phone with best camera? How does it fare against the Google Pixel, which is widely believe as the best shooter among the phones right now? (In all images in this article, the left picture is clicked with Pixel and the right one is by the Galaxy S8. For bigger image sizes click thumbnails at the end of the article) To check this, we clicked with some photos with both the Galaxy S8 and the Google Pixel. The scenes were same and the fact that both use a 12-megzpixel sensor meant that the image sizes in pixels were also same. The results that India Today Tech got from the two cameras was that the Galaxy S8 was, most of the time, able to match if not surpass the mighty Pixel. This was unexpected actually. But then the images, they don't lie. I will go into a basic analysis of what the Galaxy S8 and the Pixel captured, but before that a few words on the hardware of the two phones. 12 megapixels vs 12 megapixels Both the Pixel and the Galaxy S8 come with 12-megapixel image sensors. Both also have only one rear camera, unlike the phones like the iPhone 7 Plus and Micromax Dual 5 that have two cameras. But that is where the similarities end. The Pixel has the Sony-made IMX378 image sensor. This sensor, and its big size (7.81mm), is the reason why the Pixel is so good, especially in the light. The large image sensor also means the camera creates the photo with large pixels, which are better at dealing with low light and help the photo get better image data. The overall effect is that a photo when processed using a large image sensor is likely to have more dynamic light, better colours, more details and overall more pleasant photos. The interesting bit is that the Galaxy S8 in India too comes with a large sensor. And that is a huge surprise, and the reason why it competes so well with the Pixel. This is unlike in the US and other markets where the Galaxy S8 has a different image sensor. In India, the Galaxy S8 -- and the Galaxy S8 Plus -- comes with the Samsung-made S5K2L2 image sensor. This uses Samsung's own ISOCELL technology and has a physical size of 7.81mm. This means, the image sensor in the Indian variant of the Galaxy S8 is as big as the one in the Pixel. This information on S5K2L2 comes from Wikipedia as Samsung doesn't specify details of this sensor on its website, but the large size is something that makes sense given the performance of the S8 camera that I tested. While the image sensor size is one area where the Galaxy S8 matches the Pixel, in the lens department it surpasses the Google phone. The Galaxy S8 comes with a F1.7 lens, which not only allows it to capture more light but also helps it get more creamy or blurred background. The Pixel, meanwhile, uses a F2.0 lens. Matched performance With hardware that is so similar, we saw that the Google Pixel and the Galaxy S8 (India version) capture images that are very similar. The big difference between how these phones perform comes from the way they process images and how they expose a photo. All images were shot on auto mode, just the way regular consumers shoot them. In summary, here is what I found: 1- The Galaxy S8 and the Pixel both capture brilliant colours. But the S8 produces more cleaner and more saturated colours. This is because of the exposure that S8 almost always gets right in good and decent light. It tends to expose keeping in sight the shadows produces images that have a sort lustre to them. The Pixel tends to expose for the highlights and hence produces slightly underexposed images compared to what the S8 manages. 2- The same thing that gives the S8 an edge in good light turns against it in low light. In low light, by metering the photo for highlights, the Pixel provides more balanced image (see the example of the DLF Mall of India). The S8, on the other hand has overexposed highlights. 3- Both phones do a brilliant job of handling noise, especially in low light. But the S8 deals with noise in a better way, even if occasionally it leads to loss of detail. 4- Pixel captures more true-to-life colours, although many users may find them relatively dull compared to what S8 can manage. 5- Occasionally, the S8 shoots images that have a magenta tinge in them. The Pixel images are more true-to-life. 6- Both phones deal with the HDR in a fantastic way, although in such scenes (unless it is not too dark) Galaxy S8 manages the shadows in a better way. Surprising performance from Galaxy S8 When I went into this comparison, I had thought that the Pixel will come up superior, the way it has done umpteen of times in the last six odd months. The camera in the Pixel is absolutely fantastic and in the last few months we have seen it beat from Galaxy S7 to the iPhone 7 with ease. But with the Galaxy S8, this didn't turn out to be the case. And it was only after I had clicked all the photos and was seeing them on the big screen that I figured that something was amiss. Also Read: Galaxy S8 takes aim at greatness but possibly misses because of the camera Samsung has not advertised what sensor it is using in the Galaxy S8 and the Galaxy S8 Plus. But most of the time people have found it is the Sony-made IMX 333. But this is a smaller sensor compared to the one in the Pixel and yet I found the Galaxy S8 not only matching the best in the business but also surpassing it occasionally. So I used an app to get the camera details of the Galaxy S8. And that explained it all. The Indian variant of the Galaxy S8 actually has a different sensor. It's not IMX 333. It is Samsung's own sensor, that is as big as the one in the Google Pixel. It is the S5K2L2. Also Read: Pixel XL quick review: Google's love letter to Android fans Now, not enough details about features of the S5K2L2 area available from Samsung. The company doesn't talk about it and neither lists it on its website along with other image sensors it makes. But it is definitely not a small image sensor and Wikipedia is to be believed its good performance is definitely because of its large size.

Fortunately, Google has added some much needed features to its web browser for offline users. Last year, Google added a new feature to Chrome allowing you to download web pages. You could then view those pages without the need of internet connectivity. According to Google’s statistics, more than 45 million pages are downloaded every week. Now, thanks to the success of that feature,  the search engine giant is announcing a bunch of new additions to improve the “offline browsing experience”. Lets take a look at the new features for offline users. From left to right: New download link option, download page later button, offline badge Download Link This option lets you save any web page by long pressing on a link and selecting “Download Link” from the menu that shows up. This will save the page for offline viewing and can be accessed at any time until you delete it yourself. Download Later and Offline Badge If you are suffering from an internet outage, this one is for you. If you open a website and run into the familiar “You are offline” page (the one with the dinosaur) you can simply tap on “Download Link Later”. Chrome will then download the web page whenever you go back online. It’s now easier to get to the saved offline web pages. All you need to do is open a new tab on Chrome and scroll down to “Downloads”. You’ll see any pages saved offline tagged with a gray ticked badge. These updates are available for Google Chrome on Android. Built-in Adblocker Coming Soon? Earlier, Wall Street Journal reported that the most used browser in the world, Google Chrome, is going to get a built-in adblocker in the future.

The dream of a smart home was finally becoming a reality, giving tech junkies the opportunity to control their calendar, their music, and even their lights with a simple voice command. While a few bugs existed, like the fact that certain commercials and Netflix specials were setting it off, the overall consensus was that this kind of tech could completely revolutionize how every day consumers interact with technology. Shortly after that, Google Home fully established itself in the market with a product that can integrate with all your Google accounts and a notably persistent marketing campaign. Considering many tech enthusiasts already have a Gmail account, a Google calendar, and maybe even a Google Play Music account, their second place status didn’t hinder their ability to make moves in the voice assistant race to the top. Now, another tech giant is throwing their name in the ring, as Microsoft’s voice assistant Cortana has found a home in Harman Kardon’s Invoke speaker. “We are excited to partner with Harman Kardon to create a speaker that combines premium audio and stylish design with the intelligence of Cortana.” said Jordi Ribas, CVP, AI Products at Microsoft. “This is our next step in bringing Cortana to even more devices to help users be more productive wherever they are.” Microsoft clearly recognized the potential for voice assistants in the tech world. With Amazon and Google doing well enough to warrant a lot of attention, the tech giant knows that using your voice to control technology is going to become the norm in the world of consumer technology. “Voice-enabled technology is the future; by teaming up with Microsoft, we’re delivering on our promise of elevating a connected life through smart technology, superior sound and the stunning design that is Harman Kardon’s hallmark,” said Mauser in the same post. said Michael Mauser, President, Lifestyle Audio Division at HARMAN in the same post. As far as details about the brand new voice assistant are concerned, Microsoft and Harman Kardon are playing things pretty close to the chest. Other than the decidedly improved audio features (three subwoofers and three tweets to create “360-degree sound” for easy commands), not a lot has been released about the potentially new features available.

A few details leaked out last year, back when it was little more than a command line OS, but we had an official codename: Fuchsia. The OS appears to be making some progress. First off, unlike Android and Chrome OS, Fuchsia isn’t based on Linux. Apparently Google’s created a new in-house “microkernel” they’re calling Magenta. According to Google, Fuchsia will target “modern phones and modern personal computers with fast processors, non-trivial amounts of RAM with arbitrary peripherals doing open-ended computation.” Exactly what they mean by that — and when we can expect to see this land on any sort of hardware — remains to be seen. But we do know that Fuchsia now has a fully interactive system UI — dubbed Armadillo — that’s drastically unlike anything we’ve seen before. Providing us with our first look is HotFix.net’s Kyle Bradshaw who has compiled Armadillo into demo app for all to see. Here’s the video: As you can see, Fuchsia is still extremely. The UI appears to be one big vertical scrolling page with placeholder “cards” (apps?) of information. There’s no back or recents button, just a home button that shows a user’s profile. The most interesting (and usable) part is the multitasking which you can activate by long pressing a card and combining it with another. Despite having all the code out in the open, Google is still surprisingly mum on Fuchsia details although we imagine we’ll learn more at Google I/O coming up in just a few weeks time. If you’d like to see Armadillo in action, you can sideload it onto your Android device by downloading the APK below. Download: Armadillo APK Judging by what you’ve seen so far — what do you think?

Now that Android Wear is becoming a more mature platform, mostly thanks to the long-awaited 2.0 update, we're starting to see more watches than ever hit the market. It was fairly easy to compare Android Wear watches in years past - only a handful of tech companies even bothered. But now, a vast amount of wearables are being released, with most of them by actual watch companies. So how do they all stack up? You may notice some missing information below, especially from Fossil. We tried multiple times to reach out to Fossil for information on its upcoming watches, but we didn't receive a response. At a glance We've compiled a massive table comparing every watch. You can also look at it on Google Docs.

It's definitely one of the most feature-packed watches on the market, supporting every feature the OS does. It works with Wi-Fi, LTE, NFC, and GPS - and includes a heart rate sensor and a speaker. As far as specifications go, it has a Snapdragon Wear 2100 CPU, a 480x480 1.38" circular display, IP68 water resistance, and a 430mAh battery. Unfortunately, battery life isn't fantastic, especially if you need to use LTE often. Be sure to check out our full review for more details, and you can buy it now from various retailers for $349. LG Watch Style Just like the Watch Sport, this was developed by LG and Google as an Android Wear 2.0 launch device. The Style is much thinner than the Sport, but at the cost of features and battery life. It lacks NFC, LTE, GPS, and a heart rate sensor. The battery capacity is just 240mAh, which should only get you through a day of use (if that). The Style has a Wear 2100 processor, a round 1.2" 360x360 display, and IP67 water resistance. You can find our full review here, and if you want to buy one for yourself, it will cost you $249. Casio Pro Trek WSD-F20 If you need a super rugged Android Wear device, the WSD-F20 may be for you. Casio announced the watch back in January, and it just recently went on sale for a whopping $500. For that price, you're getting a speaker, Wi-Fi and GPS connectivity, and a 1.32" 320x300 display. However, the WSD-F20 is missing quite a few important features. It doesn't have a heart rate sensor, NFC, or LTE. Also, it is one of the few 2017 Android Wear watches with a flat tire display. New Balance RunIQ New Balance released its first Android Wear watch earlier this year, the RunIQ. As you might guess, the RunIQ is primarily designed for workouts. It's powered by an Intel Atom Z34XX processor and includes Wi-Fi and GPS connectivity, a 1.39" 400x400 circular display, a 410mAh battery, and 5ATM water resistance. Unfortunately, the RunIQ lacks NFC for Android Pay, as well as LTE connectivity and a speaker. It's currently priced at $299. Huawei Watch 2 Why, Huawei? You were the chosen one! After the original Huawei Watch ended up being one of the best Android Wear devices on the market, many were excited for a newer model. Unfortunately, what Huawei provided was subjectively worse than the original - you can find our full review here. If you're still interested, the Huawei Watch 2 has a 1.2" 390x390 circular display, a 420mAh battery, IP67 water resistance, and all the connectivity and sensors you could want (including LTE). It's currently on sale for around $299, depending on the retailer. Huawei Watch 2 Classic The 'Classic' variant of the Huawei Watch 2 is probably closer to what most people were hoping for. It has almost exactly the same specifications as the normal Watch 2 - a Wear 2100 CPU, 1.2" 390x390 display, 420mAh battery, IP67 water resistance. However, it lacks the Wear 2's LTE support. The Watch 2 Classic is also $70 more expensive than the normal model, and shares many of its faults - small screen, no digital crown, etc. It's currently priced at $369 at most retailers. TAG Heuer Connected Modular 45 The award for the longest smartwatch name goes to the TAG Heuer Connected Modular 45. This watch has an Intel Atom Z34XX processor (the same one the Casio watch uses), 1.39" 400x400 circular display, 410mAh battery, and speaker. As far as connectivity and sensors, it has Wi-Fi, GPS, and NFC for Android Pay. It does not have a heart rate sensor or LTE. The Connected Modular 45 also wins the award for most expensive smartwatch on this list - you'll be shelling out $1,650 for the privilege of owning one. Montblanc Summit Similar to the TAG Huer, the Montblanc Summit is another luxury smartwatch. It has a Snapdragon Wear 2100 CPU, 1.39" 400x400 circular display, heart rate sensor, 300mAh battery, and IP68 water resistance. Unfortunately, the Summit is a bit light on functionality. It doesn't have NFC, LTE, GPS, or a speaker. Whether or not that matters is up to you, but I expect the $890 starting price will drive most normal people away. GUESS Connect (2017) GUESS has made hybrid smartwatches with dot-matrix displays in the past, but this year, the company released a proper Android Wear watch. It's available in two sizes - a 41mm for women (left) and a 44mm for men (right). The GUESS Connect has a Snapdragon Wear 2100 processor but lacks NFC, LTE, GPS, and a heart rate sensor. The watch is expected to be released in Fall or Winter 2017 and will start at $300. Michael Kors Access Grayson/Sofie Michael Kors announced two very similar Android Wear watches earlier this year, the Access Grayson (left) and Access Sofie (right). The Grayson looks more like a traditional men's watch, with an AMOLED display and a digital crown. It will be available in gold, stainless steel, and blue/black. The Sofie is primarily targeted at women, with a thinner case and a lighter feel than the Grayson. It has the same AMOLED display, but sadly lacks a digital crown. It will have eight plating/bracelet combinations and seven interchangeable strap options. Both watches have a Snapdragon Wear 2100 processor and will start at $350. Misfit Vapor There are plenty of expensive products on this list, but if you're looking for a good value smartwatch, the Misfit Vapor might be the best choice. It's the second-cheapest Android Wear device on this list, at just $199, but it has a Wear 2100 processor, a 1.39" circular display, water resistance up to 50 meters, Wi-Fi, GPS, and a heart rate sensor. However, I was unable to find confirmation that the Vapor included a speaker. Design-wise, the Misfit Vapor is definitely one of my favorites. It has a similar design to the Moto 360, but with a small bezel surrounding the screen instead of the 360's flat tire. It will launch in "Late Summer 2017." Diesel On Diesel's first Android Wear watch, the Diesel On, was announced earlier this year at Baselworld 2017. Hardly any useful information about it has been revealed, besides the fact that it uses a Snapdragon Wear 2100 processor and will have "hundreds of customization options." It looks like it has a digital crown, but we can't be sure. The watch will be available in "Holiday 2017," and will start at $350. Fossil Q Venture/Q Explorist Fossil's first Android Wear watch was released back in 2015, and the company followed up on it with two more in 2016. This year, Fossil is releasing the Q Venture and Q Explorist. Details on these are also incredibly sparse, but we do know both watches will have a Snapdragon Wear 2100 CPU and will be released in the Fall. It seems very likely that both watches have a flat tire display, as companies often try to use black watch faces in promotional material (such as the above image) to hide it. In fact, adjusting the brightness and contrast on the above image does reveal a flat tire. Movado Connect Movado's first Android Wear device, the Movado Connect, definitely looks sleek. It has an edge-to-edge 1.46" 400x400 circular display, a 300mAh battery, Wi-Fi connectivity, and NFC for Android Pay. However, it is worth noting that the Connect lacks a speaker, LTE, GPS, and a heart rate sensor. The watch will be available in Fall 2017, starting at $495. Hugo Boss Touch Another sleek Android Wear watch announced this year is the Hugo Boss Touch, priced at $395. The specifications are identical to the Movado Connect - Wear 2100 CPU, 300mAh battery, 1.46" 400x400 circular display, and Wi-Fi/NFC connectivity. Just like the Connect, it's missing a speaker, LTE, GPS, and a heart rate sensor. You'll be able to buy it this Fall. Tommy Hilfiger TH24/7You This watch wins the award for the worst smartwatch name, but it seems to be pretty good at everything else. It has a Wear 2100 processor, a 1.4" circular 400x400 display, and a 300mAh battery. The watch does have Wi-Fi and NFC support, but lacks a speaker, LTE, GPS, and a heart rate sensor. You'll be able to buy the TH24/7You in the Fall for $299 - making it one of the more competitively-priced options on this list. ZTE Quartz At $192, the ZTE Quartz is the least expensive watch on this list, barely beating out the Misfit Vapor. Currently exclusive to T-Mobile, the Quartz has a Wear 2100 CPU, 1.4" 400x400 circular display, and IP67 water resistance. It supports Wi-Fi, 3G, and GPS connectivity, but no NFC. There's also no heart rate sensor on the Quartz, but it does have the largest battery of any watch on this list at 500mAh. The carrier exclusivity is a bit of a bummer, but maybe we'll see an unlocked model show up in the future. Verizon Wear24 Verizon surprised everyone when it announced an LTE-capable Android Wear watch alongside the LG Watch Sport, undercutting the latter device in the process. The Wear24 has all the features of the Watch Sport, except GPS and a heart rate sensor (and possibly a speaker, Verizon hasn't confirmed that). When the Wear24 goes on sale, you'll be able to buy it for $349 outright or $300 on a two-year contract. It also remains to be seen how bulky the watch will be - that was definitely a problem for the Watch Sport, and Verizon hasn't released any photos. Conclusion We're starting to see more and more actual watch companies invest in Android Wear, which I see as a good thing for the platform. Up until now, Android Wear has largely only been used by tech enthusiasts. I've seen plenty of people with Apple Watches (not as many as Apple would like, but still), but hardly anyone with Android Wear devices. Android Wear 2.0 in general is a bit of a mixed bag. While I personally don't mind the changes as much, others are much less happy about it, and for valid reasons. We'll have to see where the platform goes in the coming months (and years), but there is no shortage of watches to choose from.

Such a shame. Corbin Davenport That one was released in 2016. Dimitris Kanellopoulos Right. Sorry Raven ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It might also have been released late 2016, but it is a shame that you did not include the Asus ZenWatch 3 in this comparison. I think it is one of the best Wear 2100 based smart watches currently available and at only $209 it is a steal compared to some of the ones listed here. I am loving mine. Tucker Sferro scrolling down the list, I am amazed at the prices. I loved my Moto 360 1st gen, I paid $100 for it on Craigslist. That's exactly what it's worth. You know why? The battery died after about 18 months and it's now a brick. The general public doesnt want to pay more than $150 for a secondary "cell phone-like" piece of hardware that only lasts 2 years, period. Smartwatches will NEVER take off until the cost point drops dramatically. This is the same thing that e-readers went through, until Amazon stepped up to the plate and brought the costs dow. Thomas Paulsen A fellow Moto 360 1st gen user here with a dead battery. I paid top dollar and it burned me so much that I am holding back from another purchase. The only reasons that I would reconsider are being able to open smart locks with NFC, robust assistant voice control ("open garage door"), broader Android Pay availability and - of course - a moderate price because we all know gadgets become obsolete fast. Tucker Sferro I found an article online that shows you how to replace the battery ($15), but it involved cracking the plastic off the back of the 360, etc. I would also be unhappy if I paid full price. Thomas Paulsen This video was posted two months ago and details the battery swap: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1as_h5jnBM Lazyboy0172 Oh I am going to be very sad when my battery dies. I've had my 360 since september 2014 and have no battery problems so far, but I'll be very sad to lose it. That's really the only thing that will get me to replace it though, because right now the thought of spending $300+ on something newer with the only real difference being that it looks better does not make sense to me. And I think that's the problem with the market right now- the price points just aren't there between manufacturers and consumers. Consumers do not want to supplement their $500 phone with a $400 watch, and then have to replace that watch every couple years. But no manufacturer can afford to sell a nice looking watch at <$150 and then also not have any repeat customers for 3+ years. Tucker Sferro you bring up a good point, that manufacturers are unable to bring the costs down to a more attractive level, which is why someone like Amazon (shudders) might be able to lower the cost with a Fire watch, or something like that. Oh boy, ads on my watch?! I just threw up on myself. brkshr Replacing the battery costs about $10 and 20 minutes. Kyle R Krcmaric I just want to have Android Wear at or below $150 on a device that supports Android Pay. GreatNews You forgot to include the all new ZTE Quartz https://www.t-mobile.com/internet-device/zte-quartz Corbin Davenport You're right, I'll be adding it shortly. Rorison Meadows II I need a camera on a decent sized one for video calling and photos. Come on people! marcusmarcus2 Here you go :) http://www.doki.com/ Daniel Nava Best Buy has the LG Watch Style for $170 right now. I picked one up and could not be happier with it. I just wanted a nice looking basic Android Wear watch under $200 and I got it. Matt It's a shame that Wear 2.0 is so bad. Roy ?WHY kamiller42 Oh. Where do I begin? 1. The watch is no longer an extension of the phone. This hurts the convenience of using the watch. 2. Apps that used to work no longer. Most times, permissions have to be granted again. Other times, the watch app has lost connectivity with the phone. 3. Notifications which used to appear don't. 4. It's slower than previous versions. 5. Theater mode in 1 click, 1 swipe, and 2 taps vs 2 clicks. 6. DnD no longer works. Why? Because Google wants the watch to act as an independent device. DnD on watch and phone are not connected. A handful of people say that's great, but the situations they bring up are edge cases. Most people, when they say "Do not disturb me" means do not disturb me at all. 7. I have not figured out to answer the phone from the watch. The only option I see is to refuse call. Used to be simple. Swipe right to answer. Swipe left to refuse. Roy 1. It's great. Only need good sync. 2. Wich apps? 3. Why not? All the reviews says it's work. 4. Mmm for sure now they need to upgrade the hardware for independent os. 5. What's for? 6. You right about that. 7. I didn't hear about that. So if I can Make a summary no everything work flawless so it's good that I didn't buy one just yet but it doesn't mean that Android Wear 2.0 not in good Direction. I hated the first version. Matt Why is that a shame or why is it bad? Michael Maggard ZTE Quartz came out in 2017, has Android Wear 2.0, and is under US$200. https://www.t-mobile.com/internet-device/zte-quartz Corbin Davenport Yep, I'll be adding it to the post shortly. Derik Taylor Also, the ZTE Quartz does have GPS. In the description, you said it doesn't. :| (I have it, which is the only reason I knew that.) marcusmarcus2 The discription also says it has NFC but I cannot see that it does on the T mobile website or the ZTE website. Derik Taylor Huh...didn't notice that. No NFC. :( Not that I planned on using it anyway, but still would have been nice as an option. abqnm I see it's on there now. There's a bit of an error though. In the blurb for it, it says there IS NFC but NO GPS. It's the other way around. It HAS GPS and NO NFC. The entry in the table is correct though. Thanks for this post. It's a great way to compare at a glance. Corbin Davenport Yep, some info got mixed when I was adding the Quartz and Wear24 at the same time. Both the table and the article text should be correct now. abqnm Thanks, but it's not quite correct still. The Quartz description now says but no GPS, LTE, or NFC It does have GPS, but not LTE or NFC. marcusmarcus2 Third time's a charm http://s2.quickmeme.com/img/1a/1ab37c4fc16eae0cf8505ad03c1652fea7659118ab91a6fa386c4e1e514266aa.jpg Corbin Davenport I clearly can't write today. Fixed! abqnm Haha no worries. We've all been there. marcusmarcus2 https://www.zteusa.com/zte-quartz "500 mAh" Dang, it has the largest battery compared to those listed and it still only has "up to 36 hours of battery life per charge" Kyle Gospodnetich Are you guys ever going to talk about the joke that is the Android Wear 2.0 OTAs? Most watches don't even have it yet, and Google completely backed down on their 'fast update, all at once' promise. Dan W agreed. i was hoping that AP would hold Google's feet to the fire on the 2.0 updates. they've been a tragic reminder of how little Google and its partners care about timely updates. Captain On! It's hard to forget, but updates aren't solely on Google. Manufacturers and driver support can hold software updates back regardless of Google trying to shove it out the door. EcE But since there was such promise, shouldn't have Google "certified" the watches somehow? Ensuring that the updates can be pushed timely? kamiller42 Google is doing you a favor. AW 2.0 is a work in progress. Its flow is not as fast and fluid as previous. me me Agreed, I tried the Developer Preview, Watch become unusable. Ambition >> specifications. Carson Saldanha When did they say "fast update, all at once" Mayoo Honorable mention to one of the longest tags section I've seen on AP https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4be9fae6b2e3863638bc20bd2881a3021302f2677608ddc958771313cae23baf.png PJ Anderson The LG Watch Style has a speaker? David Ruddock It doesn't, the table has been corrected. IcerC The Verizon Wear24 comes out in less than a week right? Add that one. tu3218 Has Verizon even announced a date yet? Still nothing on their website. Rashad May 11 tu3218 Where did you see that? Rashad I added the link afterwards. tu3218 Good deal. Although I'm really still waiting for the gear S3. But we all know how that's going for Verizon. Corbin Davenport Yeah, I'll add that one as well. YaKillaCJ The messed up part is the Misfit Vapor is the clear winner in terms of aesthetics and specs when not factoring price. Yet it's priced ridiculously competitive. I think I will get it to upgrade my Moto 360 1st Gen. victor sanchez same here. jawsnnn It will probably have some glaring flaw when it comes out. That has been the pattern for Android Wear devices so far: Announcement,Excitement,Dashed hopes and dreams. Nick Coad Agreed, it's my favourite so far, but I'm really disappointed by the lack of a digital crown since it looks so useful for navigation. 005 anyone know if Misfit vapor has speaker if that has speaker that seals the deal all the way i can leave with out NFC for that price its hands down the best if only had spaker Corbin Davenport I found no mention of a speaker anywhere. 005 thanks hope they do because Huawei Watch 2 Classic went way down in design not sure what the heck happen ObligatoryEscapments It has 5ATM water resistance. In the Android Wear world, that means no speaker. (See: Casio, Nixon, Polar. All speakerless) i_say_uuhhh That Movado looks amazing, just wish it had a speaker and LTE. skillfulshoe Don't be fooled by that picture, it doesn't have an edge to edge screen. Not sure how AP missed that. https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/3/24/15052504/movado-android-wear-watch-connect-baselworld-2017 Roy THE CPU IS CRAP. marcusmarcus2 Really? I thought it was silicon. Roy Really why 28nm?! Stevie_Wonder The Misfit will probably be my first smartwatch. Might have some shortcomings, for example the lacking of NFC, but I don't think I will really need that since Android Pay isn't even launched here. Not sure if a speaker is really useful. And a question for the smartwatch users. My provider doesn't support a second sim so can't use the LTE option, but how useful is it and do you use it a lot? Will it connect through Bluetooth with your phone first and if that fails use LTE to connect? ObligatoryEscapments Casio is even stingier than Fossil with specs, but it's very surprising to hear that they've abandoned their custom SoC from the WSD-10 to use the Qualcomm. Also, I think it's a safe assumption the Verizon/Quanta Wear24 has a speaker. It's an LTE watch that makes phone calls. haberd I would love to see dimensions added. My major problem with this crop is they are too bulky for constant wear bābā ghanūj Full spec sheet for all Android Wear watches here! https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lbKhNnFBARrT5TVo3bkyp1UzT0S5Iahy3W9dAQf_sfc/edit#gid=0 ethd "The award for the longest smartwatch name goes to the TAG Heuer Connected Modular 45. This watch has an Intel Atom Z34XX processor (the same one the Casio watch uses), 1.39" 400x400 circular display, 410mAh battery, and speaker." I think you meant that it has the same processor the New Balance one uses. Your table and the article both say that the Casio Pro Trek uses a SDW2100. JD Seeing how Google Treats Android Wear. That's a big list of Casualties to add to the already long list of casualties. FlyOnTheWall No Polar M600? Corbin Davenport That was released last year. Jordan L Hey, my Huawei watch just got AW 2.0 final ( I think) it's updating now. Akshdeep For ZTE Quartz in the table you have mentioned screen size as 1.4 and 400x400 but below you have written 1.3 and 480x480. Please make correction. Corbin Davenport Thanks, it has been fixed. Carson Saldanha The table says the LG Watch Style has a speaker, but I'm pretty sure it doesn't. Might wanna fix that ;) jmwils3 Haven't gotten any final news from Verizon, as the csms don't have the information, but the NFC chip on the wear24 don't seem to be active and no Android pay present, at least currently. Who knows if an update will activate them by official launch day, but the fact the original verizon article has been edited to remove references to NFC and the product page is gone isn't all that encouraging. Iagoba Apellaniz Compass? I want to see the ability to point to north Richard Markert I have both gens of 360, but I'm going to get a Gear S3 Classic for my next smartwatch. Not going to do another Wear watch. lcasale Can't even buy the LG Sport. It's been sold out on the Google Store and Verizon has pushed back the pre-ordered twice now (by two months). I'm expecting them to miss the latest 5/11 ship date as well. b_boogey_xl I think I'll go with the Huawei Watch 2 Classic. The only knock I have with it is, no LTE (not a deal breaker but…) and I wish they left off those notches that do nothing for a digital watch 🙄. Don't really care for a digital crown since it doesn't have a greater function like it does on the Apple Watch, it just sounds like a "me too" feature. Now just to wait for the price to drop since everyone hates it… 😊. peterfares You sure the Wear24 doesn't have GPS? I think it does. OrangeSweater Are you sure the Misfit Vapor has LTE? The only thing I see listed on the product page is Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity. It seems odd that it would include LTE when it is so much cheaper than what is available from other companies.

PHOTO COURTESY: GOOGLE MAPS Pakistan and Afghanistan plan to use Google Maps to help settle a border dispute that led to deadly clashes last week, officials from both sides said Monday. At least eight civilians were killed on both sides in fighting that began when a Pakistani census team accompanied by soldiers visited disputed villages along the southern border on Friday. No intention to destabilise Pakistan, says Abdullah Pakistan inherited its 2,400-kilometre border with its western neighbour when it gained independence from Britain in 1947, but Afghanistan has never formally recognised it. And while official Afghan maps reflect the so-called “Durand Line”, many nationalists believe the true border of their country ends at the River Indus that runs though Pakistan and gave India its name. “Officials from the geological survey departments of the two countries will conduct a survey, and they will also make use of Google Maps,” said a senior Pakistani security source in Islamabad who requested anonymity. Abdul Razeq, the police chief of Afghanistan’s Kandahar province, added: “After negotiations, both sides have agreed that a geological survey should be conducted. “Technical teams of both countries will use GPS and Google Maps as well as other means to get the answer.” Internet firm Google complies with local laws in certain countries that compel it to show borders in line with national demands. For instance, its Indian site shows the entirety of Indian-held Kashmir as controlled by India. Pakistan army kills 50 Afghan troops in Chaman: IGFC In Pakistan, however, the site shows the internationally recognised de facto border, the Line of Control, marked with a dotted line to denote it is disputed. In 2010 Google was embroiled in a Central American border dispute that saw two neighbouring countries dispatch troops and heavily armed police to their joint border. The incident happened after a Nicaraguan commander cited Google’s version of the border map in an interview with Costa Rican newspaper La Nacion to justify a raid on a disputed area of Costa Rica. Google later said it had made a mistake and corrected its map to reflect one sanctioned by the US State Department. Pakistan last year began trying to harden the traditionally soft border with Afghanistan through trenching and fencing, but its efforts were met with hostility from Kabul. Ethnic Pashtuns living in the region have traditionally paid it little heed. Villages straddling the frontier have mosques and houses with one door in Pakistan and another in Afghanistan. Pakistani forces on Sunday elevated their rhetoric when they said they had also killed “more than 50 soldiers” in last week’s border clashes — a claim quickly rejected by Kabul, which said it lost two soldiers.

New Atlas Lifestyle Science Technology Transport Search Subscribe Around The Home Microsoft and Harman Kardon put Cortana in the home Scott Collie May 8, 2017 Harman Kardon and Microsoft have teamed up to put Cortana in the home  View gallery - 4 images Amazon may have got the smart speaker ball rolling with its Echo, but competitors are starting to come thick and fast. Google has the (excellent) Google Home, and now Microsoft has teamed up with Harman Kardon to put Cortana in the home with the Invoke. Not only will the speaker offer 360-degree sound, it'll be able to control your smart home and make Skype calls. On the surface, the Invoke looks similar to the Amazon Echo. It's a tall, cylindrical speaker with a glowing blue light on top, available in inoffensive black or silver. Inside, there's a seven-microphone array to pick up voice commands from a distance, just like the Echo (the Google Home only has two). NEW ATLAS NEEDS YOUR SUPPORT Upgrade to a Plus subscription today, and read the site without ads. It's just US$19 a year.UPGRADE NOW Cortana's skill set also plays by the same rules as its rivals. Like Google Assistant and Alexa, Microsoft's virtual helper will play music, manage calendars, set reminders and deliver the news headlines when prompted. There's no word on whether the system will work with Spotify or Pandora initially, but expect the range of compatible apps to grow rapidly after launch either way. Microsoft says the speaker will work as a smart home controller and can also be used to make Skype calls, something its rivals can't offer. Where the Invoke is really designed to stand out is in sound quality. Harman Kardon might be getting into the smart home game, but it's an audio company at its core, and the Invoke has been designed to reflect that. Unlike the Amazon Echo, which has a single tweeter and woofer, the Invoke has three of each. That should make for sound quality more in line with a premium, high-end speaker than its competitors. Beside sound quality, what does the Invoke offer that its rivals can't? Microsoft and Harman Kardon are both big names, and that might be enough to sway prospective buyers on the hunt for a home assistant. But we can also see people being swayed by Cortana, and the fact it's woven into Outlook and other Microsoft applications. For businesses and people deeply integrated in the Microsoft ecosystem, that could play a major part in their purchase decision. Microsoft and Harman Kardon are yet to release pricing information for the speaker, which launches in the US fall. But you can expect it to slip in around US$200, occupying the same sort of space as the Echo and Google Home.

As all Android fans already know, Google’s latest Nougat operating system is running on cold fumes. What we mean by this is that Android 7.0 Nougat is going to be replaced soon enough. It all started as a rumor but then Google decided to stop keeping things under wraps and unveil that it’s already adding the finishing touches to the developer preview of Android 8.0. Even better, Google’s Senior VP has already hinted that the upcoming operating system is going to be codenamed Oreo.   Android 8.0 Release Google has made a tradition to launch new operating systems during its annual developer conference “Google I/O” event but this time the Android parent is taking a different route. According to Google, Android 8.0 is closer that we might think. Even though many might be upset that Nougat OS is coming to an end, Google is going to make sure that Android 8.0 is so much better than it. Google Statement In regards to Android 8.0’s launch date Google stated the following in an interview: “Thank you for your interest in the Android Beta Programme. The beta for Android Nougat has concluded, and all devices that were opted in have been updated to the current public version”. Google has also added the following: “If you are still running a beta version of Nougat you may download the latest full OTA image for your device and sideload it. This will not wipe your device. We’ll update this site when the Android O Beta Programme beings”. Public Version In order to make things clear, we have to mention that Google is talking about the beta version of Android O. This means that we still have to wait a few more months until the public version finally comes out. Rumor has it that Google wants to launch the new operating system alongside the highly anticipated Pixel 2 smartphone. This is highly plausible since Google will ensure Pixel 2’s success by pairing it with its latest operating system. As many might already know, Pixel smartphones are known for representing the best that Google has to offer and equipping them with Android O is highly likely to happen.

Ferdinand Monoyer was a famous ophthalmologist, more importantly known for developing the dioptre. The doodle includes two eyes instead of the two ‘o’s in the word ‘Google’ that are trying to focus on the eye chart. The eyes try to focus on the eye chart using both eyes together as well as testing each eye separately. Image Credit: Google For the uninitiated, the dioptre is a measurement of vision that is used to this date. It is the distance from the text that you have to stand so that you can read it without any problem. To help the measurement, he developed the Text box that ophthalmologists and eye specialists use to this day to measure your eyesight. Each letter on the chart or more conventionally the box represents a different dioptre ranging from the smallest to the largest. He noted that the letters on the eye chart should be as legible as possible because that is the scale that you will be measuring and judging the eye-sight of your patient. Google has also paid him a tribute by adding his name in the eye chart. Google has been using Doodles as a way to celebrate important personalities and events in the history. This celebration also helps spread awareness about the events and important dates that people many not be aware of.

With the advent of Alexa on the Amazon Echo, more and more consumers are turning to digital assistant for those simple chores that no one wants to do. Now, Google has also entered the fray with the Google Home while Apple is also set to release a Siri speaker hardware sometime this year. This now begs to answer the question, “What about Cortana?” The good news is, Microsoft is also jumping into the digital assistant band wagon with its own version. Of course, it will feature none other than its very own personal digital assistant, Cortana. Furthermore, Microsoft will be joined by Harman Kardon in realizing this project that is now dubbed as Invoke. According to the official Harman Kardon website, the Invoke will feature Microsoft’s Cortana in its core. It will have the same features as Amazon’s Alexa in that it can also accept voice commands to do its job. Harman Kardon Invoke (via harmankardon.com) Users will be able to issue various voice commands to the Invoke to play audio, make Skype calls, and other things like web searches. On top of that, the speaker also features 360-degree sound projection technology. The Invoke is set to be released sometime this fall. Unfortunately, pricing is still unclear at the moment. Also, availability will be limited to the US for the time being. It seems like most major companies right now have their own versions of a personal digital assistant. For Apple, there is Siri while Amazon uses Alexa on the Echo and Echo Dot. The newest entry in the market is the Google Home which was released just last year. Now that Samsung also has Bixby, perhaps consumers will soon see a hardware based on Samsung’s digital assistant. Unfortunately, the Bixby app is still quite juvenile compared to the likes of Cortana, Alexa, and Siri, or even the Google Assistant. For more tech updates, be sure to check us out at TheBitbag.

As a result, millions of Clash of Clans players will need to know how to transfer their game to a new phone. Below is a quick how to guide explaining what players need to know before making the switch, and how to do it. Be careful though, or you could lose an entire village. Clash of Clans is one of the most popular games on Android and iOS and has been for years, even though Clash Royale is stealing some of its players. With millions of downloads on each platform, many will need to know how to transfer their account. Read: Clash of Clans Hacks: 3 Things You Should Know One question we keep getting is regarding how to transfer the game from one phone to another. Since everything is server side with the developer, Supercell, it isn’t just a copy/paste job. However, moving your Clash of Clans progress from one phone to another, playing on a second tablet, or switching from Android to an iPhone and more. It all can be done, so watch the quick video guide below. To be specific, this guide is how to transfer a Clash of Clans village to a new Android device, and we’ll briefly mention iOS and Game Center as well. You’ll need to download Clash of Clans on your new phone or tablet, sign into Google Games (or Apple’s Game Center) and you’re nearly done. We can even skip the tutorial now, and get right into the transfer. Being able to play Clash of Clans on my phone while out and about or while sitting on the couch, then picking up right where I left off on my tablet is an awesome feature. The entire experience is seamless, and very consistent. Being cross-platform also helps, because you can easily transfer from iOS to Android as well, or vice-versa. Meaning you can play the same village on you Android phone and iPad, switch to new devices and more. Instructions With iOS and Game Center you’ll need a device linking code, but overall the process is still extremely easy and only takes a few moments, however, you’ll need both devices side by side to enter the code. More on that below. With Android, transferring your Clash of Clans game information couldn’t be easier thanks to Google Play Games, and Google+. All you have to do is sync or sign-into Google Games (or Google+) inside the game and it transfers the data over and saves it. Download Clash of Clans on your new smartphone or tablet, then follow the steps from the video below. It’s worth mentioning that if you buy gems on the newly loaded game, or progress past a level 4 Town Hall, you can’t transfer your game data. So keep that in mind. Plus, who would want to start all over again anyways? Read: Clash of Clans May Update: What to Know The video below was filmed with an older version of the game, but very similar options and settings apply here in 2016. The steps are also slightly different for iOS. As you can see from the video above, it all takes under a minute. Simply hit the three gears “settings” button near the bottom right of the display, and connect to Google Games by hitting the “Google+ Sign-in” button, or saying ok to the Google Games popup. Once you connect to Google on the new device it will automatically sign you into Google Play Games, and find your existing game data. You’ll get a notification asking if you’d like to transfer your base, then just go ahead and select yes. Make sure it says the correct village Town Hall level before clicking Yes. Use caution, and make sure it’s loading the correct game. If you’ve started multiple different villages Google Games may have the wrong one backed up. If this for some reason doesn’t work head into settings > accounts > Google > and tap on your Google account. From here you’ll want to make sure your phone is syncing data to Google. Make sure Google+ and Google App Data sync is enabled, and you’re all set. Then try the steps from the video one more time. I used the steps above to transfer my game data from a Galaxy S4 when I first started playing, to multiple devices I use today. Currently I play Clash on the Note 5, Galaxy S7 Edge, and Pixel C tablet. All the same village. Being able to easily transfer the entire game in seconds, and enjoy the same awesome experience on an array of devices, is pretty awesome. As for iOS, the steps are somewhat different. Rather than doing all the sync options above, you’ll need to get a code from the “Old Device, New Device” pop-up from the video above. On an old device like the iPhone 5s hit settings and select “Old Device” and write down the code provided, or keep it nearby. Now, download and open Clash of Clans on a new iPhone 6s or iPad Mini, select “New Device” and enter the code provided. This will transfer the game over on iOS. Users have 5 minutes to enter the code, so don’t waste time. The village will now be on both devices. Uninstall the game on your old phone, or play on both, it’s up to you. The same steps apply to add a village from your iPhone to an iPad to play on both. Again, recent updates in 2016 could have changed this, but the steps remain about the same. This same process also works for switching Clash of Clans from Android to iPhone, or from iPhone to Android. The code method is the safest and easiest choice. If you run into problems, below are some helpful tips. If possible, write down your username, TH level, experience level, Clan name, and even your Clan tag #. This all can be helpful for the Supercell support team in locating a lost or missing village in case of problems. And yes, they can help users recover a lost base, but it may take more than a few days for a reply. Read: 10 Common Clash of Clans Problems & Fixes If you’re a Windows Phone user wondering if this is possible for you, no, sadly it is not. The game has yet to launch on Windows Phone, but it could in the near future. More details regarding transferring your village and game can also be found from the developers forum. For any and all details about this game, check out our Clash of Clans Portal. Are you still playing Clash of Clans, or did you move on to Clash Royale?

On new phone install clash (don’t buy gems or ur done for) and sign into Google+ or Google Games in settings and it will sync your game history and village over. 11/07/2014 Jimmy Reply I recently bought the htc one m8 and was looking to transfer my game over from my old phone(samsung galaxy s3) yet it loaded a version with a level 2 town hall.

I haven’t been able to play since the update and it’s pretty much left me with withdrawal symptoms. the need to upgrade, research, donate to my muchly needing clan members has really got to me. that much so Iv had to start a new base just to be involved. im now th7 already without spending a penny. i’v kinda rushed my way there because from being half way through th9 with a strong defensive base I’m missing the troops I was used to cooking and attacking with. some of my clan are close behind me due to new updates with th holding more loot plus all the other game changing updates. I won’t be spending ££ on the Base I have had to inconveniently resort to I must say. but if you can help me with recovering my official well earned 1 of a kind strategic th9 profile then il be happy to spend my hard earned money on starting some well needed upgrades that are well over due. i also can not remember the right google play details to transfer it to any other device. i know everything else that can prove that it’s my property ie (email address for payments I have made from, clan members etc) please SUPERCELL I need your help to recover or transfer to me. thanks in advance. anybody else having the same problem? advice much appreciated! 01/17/2016 brendon taylor Reply a Taylor thing is my Base that is being deprived of attention. hate seeing attackers steal from the always full collectors without any bombs going off or x bows doing their job :( take your time to have a look, even join my clan if your in need of clan. 01/26/2016 Annhfranklin Reply 0=0006my co-worker’s aunt makes $83 hourly on the internet .

When you have max level defenses and troops almost going back to level one Is a crushing blow. So I might have to retire. It will give me so much time for other things and with a busy job maybe it is for the best. 02/27/2016 Cienna Reply You care supposed to be able to get your game back on your own if you saved it like supercell recommends. If you saved it on Game Center while you played it on your iOS device then log into Game Center on your new IOS device first. You should see coc listed as one of your games. Now download and install coc. Follow prompts and it will ask you to load your old game. If you saved it on android with Google+ or google play your new android device will give you option to sign into that and load old village. If your new device is android and old was iOS or was IOS and now Android you have to link them first through the CoC game settings to get your village to load. If you don’t have your old device and didn’t link them but did save them only way I know is to find someone who has a device same as your old type of OS and doesn’t play clash of clans to allow you to download the game on their device. For iOS Sign out of their Game Center and then sign into Game Center with your account. Download CoC and once your game is up link it to Android device. For Android use their phone to load CoC and after sign in with your google play and link your new IOS. Once done they can just delete CoC from their device. I have also used an emulator for Android called Blue Stacks on a computer and then linked an IOS device. If you never saved your game then supercell is only one who can help. 03/04/2016 Rosie Reply How can I transfer my y clash of clans from my iPhone 5s to an iPhone 6s?

Company Summary NSE BSE Axis Capital Loading data... ADD TO PORTFOLIO ADD TO WATCHLIST SHARE YOUR OULOOK ChartsValuation & Peer ComparisonCommunity Buzz PEER COMPANIES Talking to Nikunj Dalmia of ET Now, Nilesh Shah, MD, Kotak AMC and Dharmesh Mehta, MD & CEO, Axis Capital, say Indian fund managers need to learn humility and flexibility from Warren Buffett. Edited excerpts: Nilesh, what is your understanding I mean for the first time I have heard Mr Buffett talk about the importance of non-American markets and he is indicating that look America is great but there are better opportunities elsewhere. Nilesh Shah: I think it is the humility of Mr Warren Buffett that he has not counted his victories but counted his defeats or lost opportunities. A person of his stature and intelligence admits that he missed Google for his investors or was not smart enough to pick up Jeff Bezos’s Amazon. This clearly shows his humility. It is true that compared to many of his peers he never invested in emerging markets as aggressively despite having a person like Ajit Jain whom he praises a lot. Jain is an Indian but he never used Ajit Jain’s talent for investment in India. So it is his humility to accept that he missed opportunities like Google, Amazon and India. Dharmesh, while he is sitting on a lot of cash -- $80 billion-- he said I have a gun which is fully loaded and I am ready to fire and now he is officially indicating that he is ready to travel. “So what, I am 86! I have got a chartered plane. I can travel as long as I can see opportunity,” he said. Dharmesh Mehta: Well obviously India will be very lucky if God comes to India to invest but the kind of rules and conditions which he needs to invest, will make it very difficult for any Indian company to qualify for his investments. We have been in touch with this company and shown them a few deals. His conditions include complete ownership, a large size market cap and going private. It is very difficult for him to find too many companies in India but I would not rule it out that may be in next few years, you may get some company which may fit his bill. But you will need a promoter who agrees to sell the company to him and then run the company for him. But obviously we will be very, very hopeful. We will be waiting for it to happen. Nilesh, Buffett has said that for the longest time interest rates acted like gravity and if interest rates go higher it will have a impact on return ratios. In India, we can be safely sure that interest rates will not go down sharply. US Fed is poised to take interest rates higher. So, if interest rates are going to go higher, the cost of capital will increase and in that time equities should underperform. Nilesh Shah: If life was so simple, all of us would have become fund managers. The reality is that there is something called real interest rate and there is something called nominal interest rates. In a scenario where nominal interest rate goes down and real interest rate goes up, there will be differential impact on to the equity return. On the other hand, if it is reversed it will have a completely different impact. In India’s case, while the nominal interest rates may not go down much, the chances of inflation coming down because of RBI getting the mandate to target inflation should create a scenario where real return could expand or could contract depending upon what is the inflation movement. We are looking at a nominal interest rate but the equity market will discount how the real interest rate moves. If real interest rate goes up then your prediction about equity market becoming expensive with higher cost of capital could come true but if real interest rate actually goes down, then probably we would not see material impact on equity market. Dharmesh, in general do you worry about what foreign investors could do in this so called rising interest rate environment? We have argued that the reason why money was coming to India was because of the float factor. That float factor still be higher with India but it will get marginalised? Nilesh Shah: You have to wait for the monsoon. It will be a real game-changer for the interest rates in India. Commodity prices globally are coming down which is a good case for India especially oil and the other commodities. So interest rate going up in India does not look like a very likely scenario. Plus with a lot of cash in the system because of demonetisation, real interest rates are not going up. In fact, they are going down. I would still make a case for the rates going down in India. The interest rates can go down further rather than staying where it is so. In that sense equity money should be flowing into India but it is only when the risk appetite goes off in the global world is when you will see the redemptions happening and obviously there is going to be one big change this year is going to be that there is lot of passive money which has come in India. That can go away if at all there is a global kind of a risk off trade that can be the risk factor for India rather than interest rates if you ask me. Another important takeaway at least for me was that Mr Buffet is talking about the disruption which could happen in the automobile industry because of driverless cars, I mean he is saying that look you may not see driverless cars on the roads of Manhattan tomorrow morning but they are coming and that will have an impact on the way how markets would value auto companies and how they would value the care insurance companies? Nilesh Shah: Undoubtedly there is the one big risk of disruption which is being faced across many industries. Amazon is disturbing or disrupting the retail sector which Mr Buffet also talked about, like driverless cars by various entities from Google to Tesla to other entities, how that will disrupt modern car retailing and modern car making industry. So these are all the disruptions which we will have to live by and we need to be preparing our investment portfolio for this potential disruptions going forward. Do you worry about suddenly getting up tomorrow morning and there is no driver and yet you are not worried because you have a driverless car? Dharmesh Mehta: We are lucky in India it is not going to happen at least for a few decades. So I am not too bothered about India in that sense but yes eventually you are going to see a lot of disruptions happening and as Nilesh right pointed out you need to balance your portfolio based on what is going to be the future but for India those technologies and those kind of disruptions are still almost a decade away, especially the automobile or those kind of things. Yes, robotics and AI will definitely be on and that should cut cost a lot for India but still India will be behind the curve as we are behind the curve in every aspect, this will also take time before India takes into the new technologies and the disruption starts in India. So the indication from Berkshire Hathaway is that they have reduced their ownership in Wal-Mart because they fear competition coming from Amazon and other e-commerce compaies. We have just taken a brick and mortar retail company public. It is quite a conundrum, is not it? Dharmesh Mehta: Well yes, but as I said India is still going to take time before all the Wal-Marts of the world are allowed here and they can destroy this or even the ecommerce takes time and nothing stops the retail companies in India to do e-commerce. In India, the brand is much more valuable and the companies which are able to give the service and deliver it on time at a right cost. will win this game. The Indian retailers are also going to be geared up for the competition which should be coming in. At the end of the day whatever happens, the profits do matter. We we need to see real profits coming out of those companies and how long they can last based on the PE investors money. Ultimately, the business has to turn around. As Mr Warren Buffet always says. end of the day you have to buy a good business which can last lifelong and make you money. So I believe the businesses which will make you money will last forever here. Over the years we have interacted and it is literally decades now. We have had some private conversations where you have given me example of Washington Post and how you have bought into companies where Buffet has been invested in them and how that has inspired you. So based on yesterday’s AGM, have you started doing your homework on a theme, idea or a mega trend? Nilesh Shah: One sector where we have been generally underweight is aviation sector and clearly Mr Buffet believes that aviation sector is something which is turning around. Now it is not worth copying his preference for the sector but what is worth copying is his humility and ability to accept changes. They were underweight on railroad sector for years and then they made biggest acquisition in the railroad sector. If I am not mistaken he has put in his largest investment in railroad sector year before last. So what we understand from this AGM is the humility to accept change. Mr Buffet at 86 years of age and with that kind of track record still believes that market is supreme and his views can change depending upon how conditions change. We are all young kids in front of Buffet yet we have far more rigidity than Mr Buffet. As fund managers we need to learn humility from the Mr Buffet and change our views depending upon changes in the market conditions. Dharmesh Mehta: Actually if you look at his entire speech and especially on India, he has given you a great indication where the money should be going. It is difficult for him to buy stocks here but for a normal investor there is enough opportunities in India and he has told the future belongs to India and the next generation will actually do much better than ours and the generation after that will do better than the next one. So he has given a clear cut long term call to buy India in that sense. What he always says is that if you are optimistic, you will always make money. If you are associated with financial markets, buy assets which are growing, buy businesses which are cheap and businesses which are adding productivity. If I blend all those things here I think we are blessed to be living in this era in India because growth is strong, demographics are looking up, not every business is expensive and if you wait for one of-- you know one bad patch in the market you can buy great companies at good prices. It is official data that Buffet has made 99% of his wealth after he turned 60, I know you are not there yet but the best of you is yet to come? Dharmesh Mehta: I hope so. I am still in my 40s. So hopefully I should be making more money going forward but yes India is where you want to be excited and to have all the money in this country which is growing very fast and we are just getting off of a bear market. The Indian economy has still not grown. People forget when the Indian economy changes and starts growing, the kind of money and the kind of profits which the companies make. For India it is a great future, we just need to stick to our discipline and our reform process and India is going to be the destination of the decade. You are already working on your calculator calculating when you will turn 60 and when you will make 99% of his wealth, right? Nilesh Shah: Let us talk about public method and as fund manager you know we have outperformed Mr Warren Buffet’s Berkshire Hathaway for the last 15 years with our fixed income fund. So it does not make us smarter than Mr Buffet. It just shows that we are on a batting pitch called India where even mediocre players like us are able to outperform Gods of investment like Mr Buffet. We are on an exciting pitch, we are in India and as the rising tide lifts all boats which is set to ensure that we are continuously generating alpha for our investors.

In the simplest terms, cloud computing is storing and accessing different data and programs over the internet and the fundamental building block for that is Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). IaaS provides support natural development, testing, and usage of the application within the cloud environment. In this article I will give you a quick intro to IaaS and then compare five providers: Amazon EC2, Google Compute Engine, IBM’s SoftLayer, Microsoft Azure and Digital Ocean. IaaS helps us to avoid the complexity of buying and operating our own servers. Moreover, maintenance and upgrading of softwares is not required. With these benefits, it is obvious that it has lower infrastructure costs in many scenarios, thus helping new organizations who do not have time and capital to invest in their own hardware. Some of the other benefits of IaaS include: services are distributed as a vast array of resources being flexible, IaaS provides dynamic scaling cost is variable as per usage multiple users can use a single piece of hardware location independence: the service can usually be accessed from anywhere as long as there is an internet connection and the security protocol of the cloud allows it Now that you are aware of the benefits of IaaS for building your web app, all you have to do is decide which solution to pick. The only problem is that there are so many choices today. As a Java developer, I initially struggled a bit when evaluating various IaaS providers. So in this article, I am going to describe the five best solutions for hosting Java web apps and compare them with each other. Amazon EC2 Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It helps in launching and managing server instances, thus making it suitable for developers for web-scale computing. You can use server instances for any legal purposes as per your requirement. Instances are available in different sizes and configurations. EC2 allows AWS to provide different instance types that you can use to meet specific needs. So, you can start different VMs depending on your needs. If you are deploying a Java app, you can install your app server (Tomcat, Web Sphere, etc.) into one VM and use other services like micro-services, databases, etc. on separate VMs with appropriate configurations. More details, specifically on how AWS works with Java, can be found here. With Amazon EC2, one has the choice of different instance types, operating systems and software packages which makes it flexible. Amazon EC2 has a memory, CPU, and instance storage configuration which helps in storage selection. Also, you can choose the boot partition size that is optimal for your choice of operating system and application. The only demerit of using EC2 can be the expenses. As my workflows became more complicated and I used more services it was hard to project costs. However, to help estimate the costs, Amazon offers a monthly calculator. The networking is not as flexible as compared to other service providers. Since a lot of data has to move from one end of LAN to another, the data traveling distance is much longer than it needs to be leading to congestion problems commonly seen on the internet. Amazon EC2 is an industry standard today. Many leading websites and apps use EC2. Some of the prominent ones are Instagram, Reddit, Netflix, Adobe Systems, Smugmug, and many more. There are many articles on Amazon’s collaboration, for example why Netflix chooses Amazon. Google Compute Engine Google Compute Engine (GCE) is an IaaS product that helps you to run VMs on the same infrastructure Google uses for its own services. GCE gives you greater flexibility and control as well as access to computing resources at a scale that can fundamentally change the way you think about tackling a problem. GCE is much like EC2, but your VMs run on Google’s infrastructure. Deploying Java on Google Compute Platform is easy. Networking pricing is expensive. As GCE is comparatively new, the choice of programming languages is limited, unlike AWS. Some Java APIs supported in AWS are not available in the Google Compute Engine. The transition from GCE to any other platform is not that easy. You should also note that to run any Java framework, GCE requires more effort from the user as it does not have integrated packages for them. The most common GCE customers are EverNote, Philips, CocoCola, HTC, Motorola, which managed to transform its data-warehousing and analytics with GCE, KhanAcademy, Spotify, PocketGems, and BestBuy. IBM’s SoftLayer As they say at IBM, “Cloud without Compromise”, the technology giant provides high-capacity, scalability, and security. IBM/SoftLayer’s high-speed intranet connections could be just what your complex applications need from an IaaS solution, but you will have to pay extra to make it work. Softlayer’s bare metal infrastructure can be combined with virtualized servers for solutions with a range of hyper-V technologies so you can optimize production workloads. It provides great high-performance bandwidth between SoftLayer’s data centers gives your cloud environment the ability to take on sudden surges of data carried from one data center to the other. Meanwhile, SoftLayer’s single tenant server model safeguards your data through comprehensive firewalls giving complete protection for sensitive information. Except for IBM/SoftLayer, no other cloud provider offers custom VM types. SoftLayer provides maven dependencies for calling its APIs. A downside is that SoftLayer’s services are not bundled well together. IBM offers a wide range of services but they’re not just cloud services. Instead, they offer a combination of public cloud services with in-house and IBM-branded services, thus offering a “virtual IT department” i.e. contacting IBM for managed services for any updation and maintenance of the software. Top users are Artomatix, Cedato and ClickTale. Microsoft Azure A comprehensive set of services that helps you to quickly develop, deploy, and manage applications across Microsoft-managed data centers globally. It has support for Windows, Linux (yes, that’s right, Microsoft now loves Linux) and community VM images as well as a choice of cross-platform development tools and frameworks. You are going to pay what you use which means that you have significant cost savings and can achieve greater efficiencies. Azure’s server gives you complete control in the cloud. Application Insights is a service for web developers on multiple platforms. It has a strong focus on security, following the standard security model of Detect, Assess, Diagnose, Stabilize and Close. Azure also provides simple, user-friendly services for increased protection, such as multi-factor authentication and application password requirements. If you need to use solutions of custom third-party software or numerous applications to run on a single machine, then Azure’s IaaS solution will help you. As a Java developer, you will find it easy to deploy and scale your WebApps here. Load-balancing between instances may interrupt the state of an application; i.e., there is no guarantee two requests from the same user will go to the same instance. Azure does not provide flexibility in choosing the instance type. Moreover, it needs to be expertly managed and maintained, which includes patching and server monitoring. Top websites hosted on Microsoft Azure are Essar, saving 65% in deployment using Azure, CloudMunch, AppPoint, and ShepHertz. Digital Ocean Digital Ocean is aimed at Linux developers. It offers a simple, uncomplicated setup and gives the user a clean, easy-to-use interface with few features and one-click deployments. It has a control panel to manage features like two-factor authentication, a good API, auto-backups, and DNS management. It offers SSD hosting which is quite cheap compared to other services. The services provided are essentials like VM and DNS management with no load balancing, hosted databases, analytics, Hadoop clusters, etc. If you are concerned about more than about autoscaling and high availability and invest more into managing servers, then Digital Ocean is suitable for your use. For Java developers, they have a community to provide tutorials on their official website. Limitation of Digital Ocean is that their disks are located in the hypervisor, and they don’t use centralized storage which results in a relatively high risk of complete data loss if hosted on a failing hypervisor. However, if you can live with that risk and you have a backup, then you will get some great performing servers at an excellent price. Top websites hosted on Digital Ocean are NodeBB, Rockerbox, Ghost, and taskRabbit. One of the success stories of digitalocean is how how jQuery uses it. Summary Let me summarize the above in a table: Properties AWS EC2 GCE IBM Softlayer Microsoft Azure Digital Ocean Key features Supports both windows and linux servers. A lot of service options, APIs are available. Great performance. Scaling is good. Combination of management, software and security features are good for an enterprise cloud administrators. Administration tools are easy to use. Setup is easy. Cheaper for startups.

Networking not so flexible, leading to congestion problems. Administration features are not that useful. Limited choice of programming language. Services are not bundled well together. Cost is high. Performance is average. No centralised storage. With this knowledge, you will be able to decide which IaaS platform is the right one for your applications. We will discuss alternatives of IaaS in the next article.

Google's "Fuchsia" operating system is taking shape with a new design Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/08 10:01am PDTMay 8, 2017 29 Plus 1 on G+ 243 Share on Facebook 78 Share on Twitter Total Shares350 Development Google News We first talked about Fuchsia, a new operating system being developed at Google, back in August (in fact, it was my first post here). At the time, there wasn't much to get excited about besides the potential - it only had a command-line interface. Now the project has a snazzy new, but clearly unfinished, interface. Summary of Fuchsia First, it's worth going over exactly what Fuchsia is, because it's been quite a while since we talked about it. As opposed to all of Google's other OSes, such as Android and Chrome OS, Fuchsia uses the company's new 'Magenta' kernel instead of Linux. According to the project's documentation, Magenta is designed for "modern phones and modern personal computers with fast processors, non-trivial amounts of ram with arbitrary peripherals doing open ended computation." Magenta's apps and the system interface are written with Google's Flutter SDK, which was initially designed to create cross-platform apps for iOS and Android. Flutter applications are written in Dart, the company's home-grown programming language. All of the system and apps are rendered by 'Escher,' which uses OpenGL or Vulkan to display everything. The 'Armadillo' interface So, on to the new stuff. Fuchsia's system UI has a new name - 'Armadillo.' Ars Technica was able to compile Armadillo into an Android APK, since it is written with the above-mentioned Flutter SDK. The interface doesn't really do anything besides looking pretty, but it does give us an idea of what the finished product could look like. The home screen is a vertical list, with a profile picture, the time, and a battery indicator in the center. Tapping the profile picture brings up something similar to Android's Quick Settings, with toggles for auto-rotate, do not disturb, Airplane Mode, and so on. Above the profile picture is the 'Story,' which the documentation describes as "a set of apps and/or modules that work together for the user to achieve a goal." Currently, this works similarly to Android's Recents screen. Users will also be able to combine stories into a 'Story Cluster.' This is what dragging a Story card into split-screen looks like. Dragging a Story card onto another one triggers a split-screen mode. The user can split an app 50/50 vertically or horizontally, drag in another app for a 33/33/33 split, or even have a tab bar appear for using all the open apps in full-screen. You can even have two apps split vertically next to two other split apps, seen below. This is far more flexible than Android's current multi-tasking functionality, but whether or not it will stay this way is uncertain. Below the profile picture is a panel resembling Google Now, with a placeholder search bar and suggestion cards. Armadillo's documentation says, "a suggestion is a representation of an action the user can take to augment an existing story or to start a new one. [The] suggestion contains enough information to create the visual representation of that concept." So maybe they will work more like an app launcher? It's hard to tell at this point. The Google Now panel, showing Fuchsia's keyboard. Keep in mind that all of this is subject to change, as the Armadillo interface (and the rest of Fuchsia OS) is still under heavy development. It's also hard to tell what Google's plans are for the operating system. Will it be neglected to Internet-of-Things devices and other basic hardware, or will it some day replace Android altogether? We'll have to wait and see.

Suicide_Note Because Google can. Corbin Davenport Ron from Ars Technica put it best: "Fuchsia really seems like a project that asks 'how would we design Android today, if we could start over?' It's a brand-new, Google-developed kernel running a brand-new, Google-developed SDK that uses a brand-new, Google-developed programming language and it's all geared to run Google's Material Design interface as quickly as possible. Google gets to dump Linux and the GPL, it can dump Java and the problems it caused with Oracle, and Google can basically insulate itself from all of Android's upstream projects and bring all the development in-house. Doing such a thing on the scale of Android today would be a massive project." makapav Would it still be open source? Also, what would happen to all the existing APKs? Corbin Davenport Fuchisa is completely open source right now. As for running Android apps, maybe Google will add some kind of stop-gap compatibility layer for running Android apps, like Chrome OS has. destinyhud read the article Suicide_Note Perhaps instead of replacing Android, this will *become* Android, as in Android P or Q? Or be the merger of Android/Chrome? m477 I could see that as Android 10. Definitely too early for P. morteum I wonder if the reason it is called "Armadillo" is because they're starting from A again, but this time they're using animals instead of desserts. Christopher Bement I think it's a smart plan, based on the guess that there's more animals to pick from in the world than tasty desserts. teolinux Ubuntu docet Paul "Tasty treats," not necessarily desserts. That said, armadillos could be a tasty treat. I won't judge. MJ I have heard desserts and candy used before which are wrong but "tasty treats" is a new one for me. To be more accurate, Android names are actually all confectionery foods. A "tasty treat" could be a slice of pizza (aka Android S). LOL Randy Gindy Armadillo is the name of the UI not the OS build itself. Matt74UK Smooth on the inside, crunchy on the outside. Armadillo ! (a few UK people of a certain age may get that). John Doe Idk this is a whole new OS with a new kernel, I doubt this will be done with an OTA update for Android. Mantas Pakėnas Even nowadays, some of Android's new functionality cannot be done via OTA updates (like dual system partitions, forced encryption I believe, etc). To make a completely hard cut sometime when this is ready, and if it's meant to replace Android, is not completely unimaginable. As is updating via OTA. If apple was able to change their file system via OTA, I don't see why changing most of the parts would not be possible. However, nobody aside from Google would do it, almost guaranteed :) Suicide_Note It could likely be done for Pixel devices, and possibly for future devices released after this new version of the OS rolls out. Adrian Meredith quite possibly, after all there no reason it couldn't also run android apps jonathan What they need to do is make this googles very own os for their pixel line and leave android for the oems Suicide_Note Not a chance. To much name recognition with Android for Google to drop it in favor of something else specific to the Pixel lineup. Dallas King Android Z confirmed! Suicide_Note More like Android A for Armadillo. m477 APK plz (no, really, I want a compiled apk the demo) Maxwell “Max” Weinbach https://github.com/fuchsia-mirror/sysui MJ Your link wasn't what the OP asked for... Maxwell “Max” Weinbach the only way to get the APK is to compile it yourself, so I linked to the Github page to a place to download the files to compile. The closest they will get. MJ Than you should have replied there is no known APK or not at all. Maxwell “Max” Weinbach It does not matter that much. I am building the APK right now. Once it is done I will post it. Here is the link on how to compile it. http://www.hotfixit.net/single-post/2017/05/03/How-to-build-Armadillo MJ Don't waste your time... They updated that article with an download of the APK. Maxwell “Max” Weinbach thanks. they just did that. I still compiled it myself though. I will try to get more out of it while I have the Sysui downloaded. Michel R. https://www.androidfilehost.com/?w=files&flid=178684 there you go MJ http://www.hotfixit.net/single-post/2017/05/03/How-to-build-Armadillo Latex beats nudity More of Proprietary code ? No thank you, we already had enough with this Pixel crud. I hope this OS dies quicker or become a chromebook OS. m477 It's open source. Latex beats nudity It's OSS but just like Android It'll be more heavily dependent on the google APIs to make it work. Look at the Pixel SysUI, Just being OSS doesn't make it open source... It's Google's OS not a Linux Based one. If this is going to replace Android It's doomsday on multiple levels. destinyhud billions of people dont care if its running linux kernel or not. maybe very few like u might. do iphone users care why kernel it runs. none of them care. u r just noise tbh Latex beats nudity Billions of people don't code. You are being a kool-aid joke tbh. destinyhud exaclt only few code and even on that few many dont care if it runs linux or not. look at iphone there are more dev there and yet they dont care for kernel. u r delusional in ur own world m477 Android it's already been on a Google-dependent road for years. I don't think this is going to change either way. An Angry Chihuahua https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/magenta/+/master/docs/getting_started.md heres the source code. do some research my dude WitnessG Imagining this running on a Google made processor is exciting. Badouken If this was the OS for the Pixel 2 alongside a Google made processor I think id cry! WitnessG Yeah I don't see this coming out for at least another 2-3 years. Badouken Indeed, but we can dream! ha Suicide_Note Maybe the Pixel 3 or 4 will see the dream become reality. Suicide_Note I'm betting this is what we'll see in a couple years time. As another commenter stated, starting with Armadillo could be Google's way of starting from the beginning (letter A codename), since there's more animal babes to use for each letter than there are dessert names to use. Timothy Vreeland You are getting the furries excited. Nomaan Armadillo should be compared to holo/material and not to dessert names. nachofrand What makes you think Google would be good at making SoCs? They're a software company and don't have the hardware expertise for hardcore ASIC development like that. Granted they can hire people, but in the end, does it matter? They're going to use ARM either way. UnlikeABoss Google fanboyism. The same reason he's excited over a brand new OS. He knows absolutely nothing about it, short of the fact that it will create more fragmentation not only in the OS space, but also the kernel space. So all we know are negative things so far. This is what we call exciting now is it? Why? Just because Google is doing it? If Microsoft made this exact same announcement, would we all be excited? Oh dear. Zsolt V No, because essentially everybody loathes Microsoft. Almost nobody's life would be worse if Microsoft vanished. marcusmarcus2 Don't they design and build their own servers to use for all their websites? Seems like those hardware work well for them. Sergii Pylypenko It's one thing to assemble the server using off-the-shelf components, or even to order a custom motherboard. It's a very different thing to design and manufacture your own chips. marcusmarcus2 I'm not saying it is the same, just that they are not only software experts. Them designing and building the servers show they do have hardware expertise that could assist them in doing the same to chips. Zsolt V Except Google's servers are not assembled from off the shelf components. Haven't been for a few years now. Roy What about TPU? Adrian Vovk Samsung Exynos devices are faster than Snapdragon, iPhones seem underpowered but are extremely snappy, etc. The point is that making both the software and hardware leads to a very fast ecosystem. Also, Google are making the TPU for neural networks nachofrand Yes, as expected. Exynos is faster than Snapdragon on the Galaxy phones, but put an Exynos in another phone...oh wait, you can't. That's the whole entire point. Snapdragon SoCs are general purpose SoCs and can be used for a multitude of phones so they're not custom tuned to every phone individually. Exynos have very specific power rails and the chip is made specifically for that phone. The thing is, sure this is better, but it's marginal and hardly worth talking about. They both use the same ARM architecture so performance gains are pretty negligible. Besides that, this is how Samsung makes money....off of device sales. Google doesn't make money that way. That isn't their business model so at this point it doesn't make sense for them to build their own SoCs when they could just work closer with hardware companies. They make their own TPUs because it aligns with their business model. Adrian Vovk The instruction set doesn't really matter? I can have a 6700k and a 6500k and the 6700k will perform much better even though they are both amd64. With what Google is doing with the Pixels (still as snappy as day one here) I'm pretty sure they can optimize it further than Samsung does. They have made it run smoother in some cases on a chip that they didn't manufacture. If they made their own chip it would allow them many freedoms that they otherwise don't have = easier design of the device. I brought up the TPUs because that is experience in chip manufacturing Jason What makes you say iPhones are under powered ? Apples chips are some of the fastest around and are extremely powerful. Adrian Vovk Specs wise. They have much worse specs on paper and it would lead to a slower experience, except Apple can optimize it because they make both the chip and the OS Stephen Sharp They could use Risc-V and have to pay to license absolutely nothing, while being able to make processors purpose built for their OS Randy Gindy That would be an interesting move. Stephen Sharp Indeed, I really want Risc-V to succeed as an open ISA nachofrand They could. But in my opinion, it's unlikely. Google isn't trying to compete with Samsung and Apple in device sales and that isn't their business model. People using their services so they can show ads is their business model. It doesn't make sense for Google to make their own SoC when others are already doing a good job. Plus, if they went to RISC-V then what? What about the modem? They have to buy a standalone modem from Qualcomm or Intel. Now you have to hire system integration and test engineers to make sure the modem is working with your SoC. Oh and then you need a whole firmware team to control the modem. At that point, buy a full blown SoC with the modem on chip. Stephen Sharp Eh you lost me at "Pixel phone" and all the other hardware they sell. Google also is a Platinum member of the Risc-V foundation, and if there is a direction they are going, more control or less control, I would guess it's "more". But that's just a guess nachofrand Hardware isn't even close to the same thing as asic development. IC design is a different world. Granted they do some custom hardware, but SoCs are a much much larger feat. It's still a possibility they do so, but it doesn't make sense with their current business model imo. Captain On! 1 - Google has stated that they're going to make their own silicon for the Pixels in time. 2 - Google actually owns/operates the world's most powerful quantum computer. They know how to make chips. Randy Gindy That quantum computer was built by DWave though Angel I read (somewhere don’t remember) that they have three different quantum computers systems. One from DWave and two home-produced. From those two, one was made by engineers and not that disimilar from DWave in its operations. The other was made by physicists and uses a different approach. nachofrand 1. I could be wrong, but I've only read that they plan on working closer with chip manufacturers. 2. Google didn't make that computer. Even if they did, quantum is so different those skills don't even translate. Romario Maxwell Google made their own custom ASIC called the Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) for their AI/Machine Learning needs on their cloud platform. See https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2016/05/Google-supercharges-machine-learning-tasks-with-custom-chip.html and https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2017/04/quantifying-the-performance-of-the-TPU-our-first-machine-learning-chip.html nachofrand Sure, although a TPU is just an accelerator. Think of it as the hexagon DSP inside of the Snapdragon SoC. That's like 1/10 of the entire chip. SoC design is much larger. Timothy Vreeland How many examples of hardware design do people have to point out before you stop? Sure the hardware they worked on previously isn't exactly the same... But before they started the hardware they are currently working on, they worked on previous hardware that wasn't the same as what they are doing now. They have shown they are competent in designing many kinds of hardware. Or do you suggest a company can only build one kind of hardware and nothing else for all eternity? How did Samsung make it's current in-house chips? Did they go to ARM college? Have they been making ARM chips since the dawn of time? No. They put together some teams and got to work, so stop blabbing and being negative. sweenish Their AI that finally beat the world's top Go players was running on custom Google chips. It's not like they don't know how. Pixelexel Imagine a Google Pixel with a Google made processor, with Fuschia, with Project Fi with Google WiFi powered by Google fiber. If I'd have this, my life would be complete. Iamsecond Ha, no. A Google processor? Supported for 18 months, then replaced with a new processor that performs half as well (but has stickers.) Does not fully process Android code, because at Google one hand doesn't even know the other hand is there, let alone talk to it. Has 20 cores (only 2 enabled outside US for 'reasons.') Has a dedicated co-processor to enable ads in every app, even those that previously didn't have them. Jason Google can't even get a phone out the door without issues and you want them to make the chips too...lol. I'll pass. UnlikeABoss "In house kernel instead of Linux". Yeah, hopefully this dies in a thousand pits of fire. "Hey Linux guys, you know how you've helped us make billions over the years with a free open source kernel? Well, we were just using you to get the "nerd" userbase. Now we own the market thanks to you guys promoting its use of Linux, we will gradually phase you out." .... m477 I hope not. Linux is not really a kernel made with smartphone in minds. I don't care for being a fan of a kernel over another. UnlikeABoss Yeah. I'd much rather use a brand new untested kernel (and all the teething issues that will come with it) in my smartphone than a mature, stable one that's hacked on by hundreds and thousands of people every month. I mean, it's just a smartphone, we don't need it to be a secure environment, right? Let's just make a nice obscure kernel that no one else will use, and just say "but but it's open source!!! love us because we are Google kk". ... ihsan ışık I'm sorry but it just looks like you are a huge Linux fan and are just against change to me. UnlikeABoss Looks can be deceiving. If you're going to fling around the Linux fanboy term, i'll fling around the Google fanboy term, and that will surely be a nice constructive argument that we will both want to continue. m477 So, in 10 years we should still be using an unoptimised kernel like Linux, because anything newer is, well, newer? UnlikeABoss Yeah, because Linux hasn't changed at all in 10 years... m477 Yes, it changed a lot, and it still has many of the same problems, which are intrinsically bound to its structure. It's not a kernel well suited for mobile devices. UnlikeABoss You think the solution is to throw it out the window and start from scratch? I disagree. I'd much rather continue improving the Linux kernel, simply because of all the eyes it will always have on its code. jonathan Play nice ladies lol m477 With this mentality we wouldn't have Linux at all. Why start anything, while we can continue this other thing which purpose was completely different? A mircokenel is more well suited than a monolitic kernel to a mobile devices, both in terms of performance and security. No matter how much you improve Linux, it will never be a microkernel. UnlikeABoss Smartphones don't need a micro kernel in 2017. You could make that argument 7 years ago. Linux can be compiled with the required drivers just like it always could. m477 I made that argument 7 years ago. They always needed something different from Linux. The fact that specific, even proprietary drivers have to be integrated in the kernel (since Android lacks an abstraction layer) is on of the problems of the interaction Android-Linux. destinyhud why havent the nerds made linux on pc's a bigger market share if they were the one who made android a global leader UnlikeABoss No nerd is promoting Linux on the desktop. All social media used to be full of people promoting Android over iOS, these days there's no need to. destinyhud why havent they promoted desktop?? just wondering why they did for android but not for desktop.. linux on desktop was an underdog for decades. android was not popular because of kernal. android became popular because it was opensource and was the only viable competition to ios. people dont care what kernel it runs. UnlikeABoss No nerd worth their salt would promote an environment that would be a downgrade from Windows. Android was not a downgrade from iOS at any point in time, it had a very equal playing field. There's a difference between promoting a good solid FOSS kernel where possible, and promoting an agenda. m477 Android was not a downgrade from iOS at any point in time By this, I get that you never used Android and iOS side by side in 2009-10. UnlikeABoss You clearly value different things. The hackability alone made it an upgrade through its lifetime. m477 The same can be said for GNU/Linux on desktop. UnlikeABoss No it can't, because hackability =/= app availability. i.e. The hackability on Linux desktop doesn't make it win over it's lack of apps, where that isn't an issue on Android. m477 App availability was horrible in the early days, compared to iOS. Even Symbian had more apps. UnlikeABoss That was fine since the early days didn't consist of using your smartphone for very much, due to under powered hardware. Techies didn't go around saying "use iOS because we can all take selfies and stick filters on it". m477 iOS devices didn't have front cameras until mid 2010. The system was better, faster, smoother, the interface was coesive, there were many more apps, and the jailbreak community, to address the techie audience you like to go on about so much, was very, very good. There were tweaks and modifications that even the wildest Android custom ROM didn't have at the time. Android was objectively a downgrade, as much as Linux was on desktop. UnlikeABoss Calling jailbraik an advantage over a FOSS OS is pretty hilarious. iOS wasn't popular because it was better, it was popular because of the amount of people getting their advice from paid employees in store. "Buy iOS so we get a commission". m477 iPhone was more popular for various reasons: marketing, having 2 years of advantage, and, yes, more marketing. But it was also better than Android, as an OS. What benefit did Android bring, with it being opensource, compared to iOS, even to a "techie"? The dev community was laughable in the early days. Why GNU/Linux on desktop was not promoted by "techies" (which is false) and Android was, even if their shortcomings were identical? destinyhud u live in a dream world. even most dev dont care about kernel. what they care about the dev platform. I am a dev and i dont care for the kernel UnlikeABoss If you're talking from the perspective of an app developer then ofcourse you don't care about the kernel, you care about which platform will make you the most money... destinyhud exactly. no one care what kernel it runs.. all dev care is what platform make money. so who is this nerd who care about kernel if most dont care about the kernel.. yeah very very few.. infact rare like u UnlikeABoss Techie == Technology Enthusiast. You can sit here and tell me that you would use the best dev environment all you want but the truth is if the iOS dev environment was awful you'd still suck it up and use it to make your money. I'm not sure how you can class yourself as an enthusiast at that point. destinyhud ever wonder why no one is up voting u and upvoting many of my comments? because what u say is BS. its that simple. I am up for ditching outdated linux if the new kernal is modern and build for modern devices. most dont care for this very few techies.. i hope this becomes true and linux kernel die.. UnlikeABoss "Ever wonder why Google fanboys upvote pro Google content and not anti-Google content?" No, no I don't wonder that. How dare someone critique a pointless change by Google, causing unnecessary fragmentation. Burn them! destinyhud u must be new here.. look at anti google comments here when they make stupid changes but if they make welcome changes people tend to agree UnlikeABoss No, I've been here a long time and made many anti-Google comments as well as pro-Google. No one in the right mind would cheer on kernel fragmentation other than those that think Google can do no wrong. destinyhud open up ur comments history and let me see if u made pro google comments. i have a feeling u r a troll UnlikeABoss Yeah, this discussion is going no where. You are not the authority here and the idea that you want to browse my history to make sure I fall in line is creepy as hell. Bye. destinyhud lol i see u dont want to open ur comments history. obvious troll m477 outdated linux i hope this becomes true and linux kernel die Woah, wait a second here. Linux is not outdated, and its death would be terrible for everyone. It's just that it's not the most apt kernel for a mobile device. destinyhud maybe not outdated but not the right fit for mobile devices. destinyhud android sucked when compared to ios.. it was a downgrade compared to ios. why did dev promote android and not desktop linux? u reasoning dont even make sense. UnlikeABoss No, it wasn't a downgrade. destinyhud yes, it was back in android initial release. iOS was better and much more polished at that time. but things changed now. UnlikeABoss "Polished" is not a factor that is used to judge a better OS. There are Linux environments that are much more polished than Windows 10, but that doesn't make desktop Linux better. destinyhud it was both polished and runs better than android at that time. polished was not the only one. it was also polished. android only got better later.. i have used android at that time and it sucked big time. UnlikeABoss You are using today's standards to judge it. If you do that, they both sucked. It worked perfectly fine for the basic things people were using it for at the time. destinyhud they both sucked at that time but android sucked more than iOS at that time. SVem26 I like to think I am in the nerd userbase and I don't care what kernel is used.. can you help me understand why it matters? UnlikeABoss Do you want a brand new obscure kernel in thing that holds most of your sensitive details? TipTop I don't want something that dates back to 90s, is full of zero-days and horrible code contributed by nobodies. UnlikeABoss The idea that it is full of zero days is hilarious. You do realize that the majority of Linux exploits are local, right? Unlike Windows. Yes there is obviously code from the 90s, but very, very little of it. Not to mention that age is not a factor in deciding bad code. The idea that old code is bad code shows your inexperience. By that standard, should we dismiss Chrome because of all the exploits being found in code that was written when it first started? Are we going to create brand new software every few years to purge "old code"? Do you have any idea whatsoever how much Linux has actually changed? Do you have any idea how much of this change is because it's considered a "universal" kernel everyone can use and is focusing on? Do you really think splitting the community over onto another kernel will increase security for either of those kernels? There's a little something called code maturity. There's a reason Microsoft has way less exploits in its kernel today than 10 years ago. They didn't write a new kernel from scratch. Sir_Brizz All OSes are full of vulnerabilities and horrible code written by nobodies. If that is your requirement then you must have gone full luddite by now. ihsan ışık Are you implying that Android got popular because of "nerds" who heard it uses the Linux kernel? UnlikeABoss If you are old enough to know the early days of android you'll know that having every single nerd on the internet promoting Android over iOS most certainly helped get the ball rolling. Once it was pushed, it snowballed into what it is today. m477 Sure. It was the nerds on the internet, not the manufacturers with ads everywhere. Most people still don't know their Galaxy runs Android. UnlikeABoss The giant billboards came YEARS afterwards, cmon. m477 Yes, and that's why Android was so unpopular in the early days. UnlikeABoss What? It was massively popular among all techies for being the open source iOS alternative. m477 You are overestimating the "techies" crowd. Even BlackBerryOS was more popular at the time. Only after the Galaxy S it started to grow, and became popular among normal people. UnlikeABoss Not really. We are talking over a decade ago now, there were far less people on the internet and it was far easier for techies to promote products because everyone was asking their "techie" friend what is best. But these days everyone is an "expert" so that's not as much of a thing. m477 Again, you overestimate how many techies there actually were. Your personal experience is anecdotal. Market shares and sell data are objective. Also, over a decade ago Android was still a camera os, and it wasn't public. UnlikeABoss No, I do not. The further back in time you go, the higher the proportion of techies there were using the internet versus others. People were only just starting to look at buying a smartphone, and asking techies what they should buy. m477 Yes, the concentration on the internet of "techies" on the internet was greater. And? What normal user at the time went to the internet, looked at reviews and said "Oh, look! The HTC magic has Linux! This random guy says its good, so I'm gonna buy it!"? You really think that a bunch of "techies">marketing? A guy saying that his toy-looking HTC G1 is better than the iPhone is more effective than billboards and tv ads? Come on, even Windows Mobile was more popular. It took Samsung's aggressive marketing to make Android popular. UnlikeABoss Windows Mobile and BlackBerry were more popular in the enterprise, that's it. The entire discussion is home users. Also I think there's been some confusion. I wasn't implying that techies on the internet were promoting Android on the internet like a marketing department. I was implying that the internet was very much a "social media" platform for techies to communicate where the majority of them would use Android and mocked the use of iOS. The actual "marketing" happened offline when a normal user would ask their "techie" friend for first time buying advice. It is nothing like that today, and the internet is nothing like the techie community it once was. m477 So, what you're saying is that the internet was a circlejerk of Android users. Ok, and? It didn't affected normal users the slightest, iOS was still more popular until Samsung took Android more seriously. The techie friend thing its only your anecdotal experience, it bears no influence on the market, in the grand scheme of things. I'd even argue that Google's very light marketing did much, much more. Also, the mindless techies that recommended half backed devices instead of better alternatives because "Uh, Linux!!" did more harm than good, both to the users and to Android. UnlikeABoss If you read my OP you'll see my original point was that Google has rode the "Android circlejerk" to popularity, and you can debate how much popularity that added as much as you want. The fact remains, it got the ball rolling. Samsung didn't pick it up "just because", it saw that a lot of people were pushing it. There were several OS at the time it could have used, including sticking to its own. Why bother with Android? Maybe because it wanted to see how much market it could take by appealing to techies? However, if you stand back and look at it, how is this any different from "embrace, extend, extinguish"? Google used that "free marketing" and has now decided to use it's massive popularity to push a different product. (Which has failed in the past and will hopefully fail again). Why hate Microsoft for doing that in the past, but we praise Google for doing it? Why are we excited for something we know nothing about that is creating fragmentation? m477 Samsung had used several OSes, it had Windows Mobile and Phone devices, Symbian devices, and proprietary devices, even Palm OS devices IIRC. They used them all. Android had was the easiest to personalise for them, and create a copy of the best selling product, which was the iPhone, and there was an app market, so they tried to release and market their flagship with it, and market it as broadly as Apple. The first Galaxy (the "non S") was was vastly ignored, because it was as little marketed as all their other devices. The techies crowd was insignificant. The free marketing is just as much as Windows 10 gets for incorporating Ubuntu's bash terminal. What you saw is not really important. I saw lots and lots of Windows Phones in 2010 and 11. Many more than Android devices. Every one I knew had one, and if I had to say which OS was the most popular only based on my personal experience, in my smallish city, I'd obviously would say Windows Phone. Why are you so attached to Linux, excluding all possibilities of giving a possibly better solution a try? The community will just fork the AOSP and continue the development of the Linux branch. UnlikeABoss Cmon, we both know Android was not easier for them to customize than simply using their own OS. No one was recommending it, techie or not, no matter how much they marketed. It's only now they are popular they are trying to slip in their own OS, and still failing. I am not attached to Linux despite people using it as an easy scapegoat to dismiss a discussion critiquing almighty Google. We currently have a situation where most kernel developers focus entirely on Linux, making it virtually the universal kernel. Why are we creating pointless fragmentation there? Why divide that community? Do we honestly believe that a divided community can produce a better kernel, or do we love it because Google is doing it? Would we love it if Microsoft did this? m477 The proprietary OS they used at the time was a Java based thing with a flash interface. Hardly able to compete against iOS. It was easier for them to use the "next Symbian" that they could customise as they wanted, and that also had an app market. If they made, say, Bada, before Android become established and popular, and marketed it as much as they did with their Galaxy S, the market would be very different today. The normal user doesn't care what OS their shiny phone runs, as long as there's facebook. I am a GNU/Linux user since the first half of the 2000s, and I've always critiqued Google for using Linux as a kernel on phones. Linux might be the universal kernel, but smartphones need a more streamlined solution. I don't care if it's Google, the MIT, or Richard Stallman in person to do it. I liked WP8 architecture. Fragmentation is not pointless if it brings benefits to the user. TipTop Nobody cares about your FSF agenda. John Q I think the chief reason Google is not using Linux is that they want a real-time OS (RTOS). Linux is at best a "soft" RTOS, possessing a real-time scheduler but this is still not nearly as real-time as an actual RTOS should be. It would take a very large effort to do that for Linux so it makes sense that Google would want to make their own kernel that they can have full control over. UnlikeABoss Let's ignore the fact that Linux is used in real time car systems for a moment. Could you elaborate on why you think Google would want/need a RTOS on their smartphones? M6 The kernel they're using, 'magenta', is opened source. So who cares if they're using linux or not? Does everyone have to use linux? UnlikeABoss No it doesn't have to be Linux. But who else will use Magenta? Probably no one. So why are we fragmenting the kernel space further? Why would you choose an immature kernel for something as valuable (your data) as your smartphone. Would you trust that? I would much rather developers continue focusing on a single kernel. WesleySmalls But wouldn't Magenta be this single kernel? UnlikeABoss If everyone decided to ditch Linux and focus purely on Magenta as the universal kernel, yes. Will that happen? WesleySmalls Could be, just not overnight. The market was already fairly well developed when Linux arrived in 1991, yet it still managed to become a very, if not the most, important player in the market. It's certainly possible, it will just require proper investment(and neglect of their alternate platforms) and patience to make it work M6 That's some straight up communist shit right there. Let's just work on one thing, because we only need one thing, everything else is redundant! Let's not allow other people to do the same thing in a different way, because competition totally doesn't spur innovation at all. WORPspeed So Andromeda definitely dead or still happening? sleepinlight Pretty sure this IS Andromeda, or at least a part of it. Andromeda was never an official name for anything, it was just the internal project name for some sort of new and/or merged OS. WORPspeed I thought Andromeda specifically referred to merging Android and Chrome OS. So is that specific merger dead or on life-support? John Q Nah, the Android/Chrome merger was just speculation from what Andromeda seemed to be. There was never any concrete evidence to imply that Andromeda was a merger. WORPspeed To quote Androidpolice : "So please, when you see Fuchsia mentioned, or speculation that it "is" Andromeda, know that it is just that: speculation. Last we heard from sources we consider extremely reliable, Android was the basis of Andromeda, and Andromeda would see its commercial debut on a new Pixel laptop later this year. It is possible Google has changed plans around Andromeda, that the initiative itself may have even been scrapped. Though, we have no reason to think so - it's more that we don't know, and haven't heard anything about Andromeda in quite some time." http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/02/15/speculation-around-googles-fuchsia-os-and-andromeda-is-creating-confusion-and-misinformation/ WORPspeed http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/02/15/speculation-around-googles-fuchsia-os-and-andromeda-is-creating-confusion-and-misinformation/ That makes them seem very separate Srujan https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/e7fda716dfcfdca76e200e51a9c9144c72e183c7e76d36b910c20ee0931aee79.gif destinyhud if this replaces android rather than having 2 separate codebase, I am all up for it. splitting the android community is dangerous senor_heisenberg Well if this does end up being what replaces Android or what Android evolves into, I just hope my apps and whatnot are compatible. Ain't got the time or money to be investing into another ecosystem. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman That's a tricky, double-edged sword. I can't fathom they would not support the old apps, or at least the vast majority of them, for exactly that reason. But in doing so it will likely be held back at least slightly from what it can/should be. Backward-compatibility tends to hold everything back. What I'd wager is we won't see this until hardware's powerful enough to make emulating the old system in a VM relatively cheap and easy, with back-end Play Store penalties to developers who don't shift to the new app models, and then slow phase-outs in stages of the older functionality and support until the new OS is running exclusively its own setup. senor_heisenberg That sounds good. Randy Gindy I think Google porting the Android Run-time to Chrome OS was to see if they could do it. morteum This is old news, I'm waiting for Fuchsia 2.0 Barracuda. /s marcusmarcus2 What if they aren't going by Animal names in general but by mammal names.

Suicide_Note This isn't a desktop OS, not to mention people tend to change phones much more often than their desktops. pfmiller Sure it's not a desktop OS, but no sense pretending that what we have leaves nothing to be desired.

Suicide_Note Not if you're a Nexus/Pixel owner, Dilbert. Randy Gindy I would generally say there is. Android phones are not supported for nearly as long as an iPhone.

Neither, this is just a side project many developers use to test and work out the feasability of a variety of things. Android is a very well developed environment, and replacing it whole is simply a no-go. Things will just gradually evolve, as they have already done with Dalvik being replaced by ART, for example. Sir_Brizz I don't think you're wrong, but it would be in Google's best interest to start building a non-JVM runtime that apps can run inside with a native language that Google has 100% full control over like Go or Dart.

Modern personal computers huh? I've been interested in Google packing ChromeOS into a LiveCD type set up we could test/install on our own computers... (*Yes, I know of Chromium, haven't tried it yet... But I would prefer it coming direct from Google, faster updates and all that). It could be interesting to try out another of Google's OSs without having to fork over several hundred for new hardware... The only problem would be drivers to support the various hardware. If not modified too much, ChromeOS could possibly use the original Gentoo Linux drivers. But with Fuchsia using its own unique kernel... That might throw things off a bit... I know a few less tech-savey individuals who would probably be more comfortable if the same OS powered their phone, tablet and desktop (should Google opt to replace Android with Fuchsia). Especially if it could run both Android apps and Chrome extensions natively. Zxyon Rhysivz This could be the beginning of distros for Android. *Imagines Ubuntu Android* Peter World Citizen This will run in parallel with Android.

Google's "Fuchsia" operating system is taking shape with a new design Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/08 10:01am PDTMay 8, 2017 29 Plus 1 on G+ 243 Share on Facebook 78 Share on Twitter Total Shares350 Development Google News We first talked about Fuchsia, a new operating system being developed at Google, back in August (in fact, it was my first post here). At the time, there wasn't much to get excited about besides the potential - it only had a command-line interface. Now the project has a snazzy new, but clearly unfinished, interface. Summary of Fuchsia First, it's worth going over exactly what Fuchsia is, because it's been quite a while since we talked about it. As opposed to all of Google's other OSes, such as Android and Chrome OS, Fuchsia uses the company's new 'Magenta' kernel instead of Linux. According to the project's documentation, Magenta is designed for "modern phones and modern personal computers with fast processors, non-trivial amounts of ram with arbitrary peripherals doing open ended computation." Magenta's apps and the system interface are written with Google's Flutter SDK, which was initially designed to create cross-platform apps for iOS and Android. Flutter applications are written in Dart, the company's home-grown programming language. All of the system and apps are rendered by 'Escher,' which uses OpenGL or Vulkan to display everything. The 'Armadillo' interface So, on to the new stuff. Fuchsia's system UI has a new name - 'Armadillo.' Ars Technica was able to compile Armadillo into an Android APK, since it is written with the above-mentioned Flutter SDK. The interface doesn't really do anything besides looking pretty, but it does give us an idea of what the finished product could look like. The home screen is a vertical list, with a profile picture, the time, and a battery indicator in the center. Tapping the profile picture brings up something similar to Android's Quick Settings, with toggles for auto-rotate, do not disturb, Airplane Mode, and so on. Above the profile picture is the 'Story,' which the documentation describes as "a set of apps and/or modules that work together for the user to achieve a goal." Currently, this works similarly to Android's Recents screen. Users will also be able to combine stories into a 'Story Cluster.' This is what dragging a Story card into split-screen looks like. Dragging a Story card onto another one triggers a split-screen mode. The user can split an app 50/50 vertically or horizontally, drag in another app for a 33/33/33 split, or even have a tab bar appear for using all the open apps in full-screen. You can even have two apps split vertically next to two other split apps, seen below. This is far more flexible than Android's current multi-tasking functionality, but whether or not it will stay this way is uncertain. Below the profile picture is a panel resembling Google Now, with a placeholder search bar and suggestion cards. Armadillo's documentation says, "a suggestion is a representation of an action the user can take to augment an existing story or to start a new one. [The] suggestion contains enough information to create the visual representation of that concept." So maybe they will work more like an app launcher? It's hard to tell at this point. The Google Now panel, showing Fuchsia's keyboard. Keep in mind that all of this is subject to change, as the Armadillo interface (and the rest of Fuchsia OS) is still under heavy development. It's also hard to tell what Google's plans are for the operating system. Will it be neglected to Internet-of-Things devices and other basic hardware, or will it some day replace Android altogether? We'll have to wait and see.

Suicide_Note Because Google can. Corbin Davenport Ron from Ars Technica put it best: "Fuchsia really seems like a project that asks 'how would we design Android today, if we could start over?' It's a brand-new, Google-developed kernel running a brand-new, Google-developed SDK that uses a brand-new, Google-developed programming language and it's all geared to run Google's Material Design interface as quickly as possible. Google gets to dump Linux and the GPL, it can dump Java and the problems it caused with Oracle, and Google can basically insulate itself from all of Android's upstream projects and bring all the development in-house. Doing such a thing on the scale of Android today would be a massive project." makapav Would it still be open source? Also, what would happen to all the existing APKs? Corbin Davenport Fuchisa is completely open source right now. As for running Android apps, maybe Google will add some kind of stop-gap compatibility layer for running Android apps, like Chrome OS has. destinyhud read the article Suicide_Note Perhaps instead of replacing Android, this will *become* Android, as in Android P or Q? Or be the merger of Android/Chrome? m477 I could see that as Android 10. Definitely too early for P. morteum I wonder if the reason it is called "Armadillo" is because they're starting from A again, but this time they're using animals instead of desserts. Christopher Bement I think it's a smart plan, based on the guess that there's more animals to pick from in the world than tasty desserts. teolinux Ubuntu docet Paul "Tasty treats," not necessarily desserts. That said, armadillos could be a tasty treat. I won't judge. MJ I have heard desserts and candy used before which are wrong but "tasty treats" is a new one for me. To be more accurate, Android names are actually all confectionery foods. A "tasty treat" could be a slice of pizza (aka Android S). LOL Randy Gindy Armadillo is the name of the UI not the OS build itself. Matt74UK Smooth on the inside, crunchy on the outside. Armadillo ! (a few UK people of a certain age may get that). John Doe Idk this is a whole new OS with a new kernel, I doubt this will be done with an OTA update for Android. Mantas Pakėnas Even nowadays, some of Android's new functionality cannot be done via OTA updates (like dual system partitions, forced encryption I believe, etc). To make a completely hard cut sometime when this is ready, and if it's meant to replace Android, is not completely unimaginable. As is updating via OTA. If apple was able to change their file system via OTA, I don't see why changing most of the parts would not be possible. However, nobody aside from Google would do it, almost guaranteed :) Suicide_Note It could likely be done for Pixel devices, and possibly for future devices released after this new version of the OS rolls out. Adrian Meredith quite possibly, after all there no reason it couldn't also run android apps jonathan What they need to do is make this googles very own os for their pixel line and leave android for the oems Suicide_Note Not a chance. To much name recognition with Android for Google to drop it in favor of something else specific to the Pixel lineup. Dallas King Android Z confirmed! Suicide_Note More like Android A for Armadillo. m477 APK plz (no, really, I want a compiled apk the demo) Maxwell “Max” Weinbach https://github.com/fuchsia-mirror/sysui MJ Your link wasn't what the OP asked for... Maxwell “Max” Weinbach the only way to get the APK is to compile it yourself, so I linked to the Github page to a place to download the files to compile. The closest they will get. MJ Than you should have replied there is no known APK or not at all. Maxwell “Max” Weinbach It does not matter that much. I am building the APK right now. Once it is done I will post it. Here is the link on how to compile it. http://www.hotfixit.net/single-post/2017/05/03/How-to-build-Armadillo MJ Don't waste your time... They updated that article with an download of the APK. Maxwell “Max” Weinbach thanks. they just did that. I still compiled it myself though. I will try to get more out of it while I have the Sysui downloaded. Michel R. https://www.androidfilehost.com/?w=files&flid=178684 there you go MJ http://www.hotfixit.net/single-post/2017/05/03/How-to-build-Armadillo Latex beats nudity More of Proprietary code ? No thank you, we already had enough with this Pixel crud. I hope this OS dies quicker or become a chromebook OS. m477 It's open source. Latex beats nudity It's OSS but just like Android It'll be more heavily dependent on the google APIs to make it work. Look at the Pixel SysUI, Just being OSS doesn't make it open source... It's Google's OS not a Linux Based one. If this is going to replace Android It's doomsday on multiple levels. destinyhud billions of people dont care if its running linux kernel or not. maybe very few like u might. do iphone users care why kernel it runs. none of them care. u r just noise tbh Latex beats nudity Billions of people don't code. You are being a kool-aid joke tbh. destinyhud exaclt only few code and even on that few many dont care if it runs linux or not. look at iphone there are more dev there and yet they dont care for kernel. u r delusional in ur own world m477 Android it's already been on a Google-dependent road for years. I don't think this is going to change either way. An Angry Chihuahua https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/magenta/+/master/docs/getting_started.md heres the source code. do some research my dude WitnessG Imagining this running on a Google made processor is exciting. Badouken If this was the OS for the Pixel 2 alongside a Google made processor I think id cry! WitnessG Yeah I don't see this coming out for at least another 2-3 years. Badouken Indeed, but we can dream! ha Suicide_Note Maybe the Pixel 3 or 4 will see the dream become reality. Suicide_Note I'm betting this is what we'll see in a couple years time. As another commenter stated, starting with Armadillo could be Google's way of starting from the beginning (letter A codename), since there's more animal babes to use for each letter than there are dessert names to use. Timothy Vreeland You are getting the furries excited. Nomaan Armadillo should be compared to holo/material and not to dessert names. nachofrand What makes you think Google would be good at making SoCs? They're a software company and don't have the hardware expertise for hardcore ASIC development like that. Granted they can hire people, but in the end, does it matter? They're going to use ARM either way. UnlikeABoss Google fanboyism. The same reason he's excited over a brand new OS. He knows absolutely nothing about it, short of the fact that it will create more fragmentation not only in the OS space, but also the kernel space. So all we know are negative things so far. This is what we call exciting now is it? Why? Just because Google is doing it? If Microsoft made this exact same announcement, would we all be excited? Oh dear. Zsolt V No, because essentially everybody loathes Microsoft. Almost nobody's life would be worse if Microsoft vanished. marcusmarcus2 Don't they design and build their own servers to use for all their websites? Seems like those hardware work well for them. Sergii Pylypenko It's one thing to assemble the server using off-the-shelf components, or even to order a custom motherboard. It's a very different thing to design and manufacture your own chips. marcusmarcus2 I'm not saying it is the same, just that they are not only software experts. Them designing and building the servers show they do have hardware expertise that could assist them in doing the same to chips. Zsolt V Except Google's servers are not assembled from off the shelf components. Haven't been for a few years now. Roy What about TPU? Adrian Vovk Samsung Exynos devices are faster than Snapdragon, iPhones seem underpowered but are extremely snappy, etc. The point is that making both the software and hardware leads to a very fast ecosystem. Also, Google are making the TPU for neural networks nachofrand Yes, as expected. Exynos is faster than Snapdragon on the Galaxy phones, but put an Exynos in another phone...oh wait, you can't. That's the whole entire point. Snapdragon SoCs are general purpose SoCs and can be used for a multitude of phones so they're not custom tuned to every phone individually. Exynos have very specific power rails and the chip is made specifically for that phone. The thing is, sure this is better, but it's marginal and hardly worth talking about. They both use the same ARM architecture so performance gains are pretty negligible. Besides that, this is how Samsung makes money....off of device sales. Google doesn't make money that way. That isn't their business model so at this point it doesn't make sense for them to build their own SoCs when they could just work closer with hardware companies. They make their own TPUs because it aligns with their business model. Adrian Vovk The instruction set doesn't really matter? I can have a 6700k and a 6500k and the 6700k will perform much better even though they are both amd64. With what Google is doing with the Pixels (still as snappy as day one here) I'm pretty sure they can optimize it further than Samsung does. They have made it run smoother in some cases on a chip that they didn't manufacture. If they made their own chip it would allow them many freedoms that they otherwise don't have = easier design of the device. I brought up the TPUs because that is experience in chip manufacturing Jason What makes you say iPhones are under powered ? Apples chips are some of the fastest around and are extremely powerful. Adrian Vovk Specs wise. They have much worse specs on paper and it would lead to a slower experience, except Apple can optimize it because they make both the chip and the OS Stephen Sharp They could use Risc-V and have to pay to license absolutely nothing, while being able to make processors purpose built for their OS Randy Gindy That would be an interesting move. Stephen Sharp Indeed, I really want Risc-V to succeed as an open ISA nachofrand They could. But in my opinion, it's unlikely. Google isn't trying to compete with Samsung and Apple in device sales and that isn't their business model. People using their services so they can show ads is their business model. It doesn't make sense for Google to make their own SoC when others are already doing a good job. Plus, if they went to RISC-V then what? What about the modem? They have to buy a standalone modem from Qualcomm or Intel. Now you have to hire system integration and test engineers to make sure the modem is working with your SoC. Oh and then you need a whole firmware team to control the modem. At that point, buy a full blown SoC with the modem on chip. Stephen Sharp Eh you lost me at "Pixel phone" and all the other hardware they sell. Google also is a Platinum member of the Risc-V foundation, and if there is a direction they are going, more control or less control, I would guess it's "more". But that's just a guess nachofrand Hardware isn't even close to the same thing as asic development. IC design is a different world. Granted they do some custom hardware, but SoCs are a much much larger feat. It's still a possibility they do so, but it doesn't make sense with their current business model imo. Captain On! 1 - Google has stated that they're going to make their own silicon for the Pixels in time. 2 - Google actually owns/operates the world's most powerful quantum computer. They know how to make chips. Randy Gindy That quantum computer was built by DWave though Angel I read (somewhere don’t remember) that they have three different quantum computers systems. One from DWave and two home-produced. From those two, one was made by engineers and not that disimilar from DWave in its operations. The other was made by physicists and uses a different approach. nachofrand 1. I could be wrong, but I've only read that they plan on working closer with chip manufacturers. 2. Google didn't make that computer. Even if they did, quantum is so different those skills don't even translate. Romario Maxwell Google made their own custom ASIC called the Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) for their AI/Machine Learning needs on their cloud platform. See https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2016/05/Google-supercharges-machine-learning-tasks-with-custom-chip.html and https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2017/04/quantifying-the-performance-of-the-TPU-our-first-machine-learning-chip.html nachofrand Sure, although a TPU is just an accelerator. Think of it as the hexagon DSP inside of the Snapdragon SoC. That's like 1/10 of the entire chip. SoC design is much larger. Timothy Vreeland How many examples of hardware design do people have to point out before you stop? Sure the hardware they worked on previously isn't exactly the same... But before they started the hardware they are currently working on, they worked on previous hardware that wasn't the same as what they are doing now. They have shown they are competent in designing many kinds of hardware. Or do you suggest a company can only build one kind of hardware and nothing else for all eternity? How did Samsung make it's current in-house chips? Did they go to ARM college? Have they been making ARM chips since the dawn of time? No. They put together some teams and got to work, so stop blabbing and being negative. sweenish Their AI that finally beat the world's top Go players was running on custom Google chips. It's not like they don't know how. Pixelexel Imagine a Google Pixel with a Google made processor, with Fuschia, with Project Fi with Google WiFi powered by Google fiber. If I'd have this, my life would be complete. Iamsecond Ha, no. A Google processor? Supported for 18 months, then replaced with a new processor that performs half as well (but has stickers.) Does not fully process Android code, because at Google one hand doesn't even know the other hand is there, let alone talk to it. Has 20 cores (only 2 enabled outside US for 'reasons.') Has a dedicated co-processor to enable ads in every app, even those that previously didn't have them. Jason Google can't even get a phone out the door without issues and you want them to make the chips too...lol. I'll pass. UnlikeABoss "In house kernel instead of Linux". Yeah, hopefully this dies in a thousand pits of fire. "Hey Linux guys, you know how you've helped us make billions over the years with a free open source kernel? Well, we were just using you to get the "nerd" userbase. Now we own the market thanks to you guys promoting its use of Linux, we will gradually phase you out." .... m477 I hope not. Linux is not really a kernel made with smartphone in minds. I don't care for being a fan of a kernel over another. UnlikeABoss Yeah. I'd much rather use a brand new untested kernel (and all the teething issues that will come with it) in my smartphone than a mature, stable one that's hacked on by hundreds and thousands of people every month. I mean, it's just a smartphone, we don't need it to be a secure environment, right? Let's just make a nice obscure kernel that no one else will use, and just say "but but it's open source!!! love us because we are Google kk". ... ihsan ışık I'm sorry but it just looks like you are a huge Linux fan and are just against change to me. UnlikeABoss Looks can be deceiving. If you're going to fling around the Linux fanboy term, i'll fling around the Google fanboy term, and that will surely be a nice constructive argument that we will both want to continue. m477 So, in 10 years we should still be using an unoptimised kernel like Linux, because anything newer is, well, newer? UnlikeABoss Yeah, because Linux hasn't changed at all in 10 years... m477 Yes, it changed a lot, and it still has many of the same problems, which are intrinsically bound to its structure. It's not a kernel well suited for mobile devices. UnlikeABoss You think the solution is to throw it out the window and start from scratch? I disagree. I'd much rather continue improving the Linux kernel, simply because of all the eyes it will always have on its code. jonathan Play nice ladies lol m477 With this mentality we wouldn't have Linux at all. Why start anything, while we can continue this other thing which purpose was completely different? A mircokenel is more well suited than a monolitic kernel to a mobile devices, both in terms of performance and security. No matter how much you improve Linux, it will never be a microkernel. UnlikeABoss Smartphones don't need a micro kernel in 2017. You could make that argument 7 years ago. Linux can be compiled with the required drivers just like it always could. m477 I made that argument 7 years ago. They always needed something different from Linux. The fact that specific, even proprietary drivers have to be integrated in the kernel (since Android lacks an abstraction layer) is on of the problems of the interaction Android-Linux. destinyhud why havent the nerds made linux on pc's a bigger market share if they were the one who made android a global leader UnlikeABoss No nerd is promoting Linux on the desktop. All social media used to be full of people promoting Android over iOS, these days there's no need to. destinyhud why havent they promoted desktop?? just wondering why they did for android but not for desktop.. linux on desktop was an underdog for decades. android was not popular because of kernal. android became popular because it was opensource and was the only viable competition to ios. people dont care what kernel it runs. UnlikeABoss No nerd worth their salt would promote an environment that would be a downgrade from Windows. Android was not a downgrade from iOS at any point in time, it had a very equal playing field. There's a difference between promoting a good solid FOSS kernel where possible, and promoting an agenda. m477 Android was not a downgrade from iOS at any point in time By this, I get that you never used Android and iOS side by side in 2009-10. UnlikeABoss You clearly value different things. The hackability alone made it an upgrade through its lifetime. m477 The same can be said for GNU/Linux on desktop. UnlikeABoss No it can't, because hackability =/= app availability. i.e. The hackability on Linux desktop doesn't make it win over it's lack of apps, where that isn't an issue on Android. m477 App availability was horrible in the early days, compared to iOS. Even Symbian had more apps. UnlikeABoss That was fine since the early days didn't consist of using your smartphone for very much, due to under powered hardware. Techies didn't go around saying "use iOS because we can all take selfies and stick filters on it". m477 iOS devices didn't have front cameras until mid 2010. The system was better, faster, smoother, the interface was coesive, there were many more apps, and the jailbreak community, to address the techie audience you like to go on about so much, was very, very good. There were tweaks and modifications that even the wildest Android custom ROM didn't have at the time. Android was objectively a downgrade, as much as Linux was on desktop. UnlikeABoss Calling jailbraik an advantage over a FOSS OS is pretty hilarious. iOS wasn't popular because it was better, it was popular because of the amount of people getting their advice from paid employees in store. "Buy iOS so we get a commission". m477 iPhone was more popular for various reasons: marketing, having 2 years of advantage, and, yes, more marketing. But it was also better than Android, as an OS. What benefit did Android bring, with it being opensource, compared to iOS, even to a "techie"? The dev community was laughable in the early days. Why GNU/Linux on desktop was not promoted by "techies" (which is false) and Android was, even if their shortcomings were identical? destinyhud u live in a dream world. even most dev dont care about kernel. what they care about the dev platform. I am a dev and i dont care for the kernel UnlikeABoss If you're talking from the perspective of an app developer then ofcourse you don't care about the kernel, you care about which platform will make you the most money... destinyhud exactly. no one care what kernel it runs.. all dev care is what platform make money. so who is this nerd who care about kernel if most dont care about the kernel.. yeah very very few.. infact rare like u UnlikeABoss Techie == Technology Enthusiast. You can sit here and tell me that you would use the best dev environment all you want but the truth is if the iOS dev environment was awful you'd still suck it up and use it to make your money. I'm not sure how you can class yourself as an enthusiast at that point. destinyhud ever wonder why no one is up voting u and upvoting many of my comments? because what u say is BS. its that simple. I am up for ditching outdated linux if the new kernal is modern and build for modern devices. most dont care for this very few techies.. i hope this becomes true and linux kernel die.. UnlikeABoss "Ever wonder why Google fanboys upvote pro Google content and not anti-Google content?" No, no I don't wonder that. How dare someone critique a pointless change by Google, causing unnecessary fragmentation. Burn them! destinyhud u must be new here.. look at anti google comments here when they make stupid changes but if they make welcome changes people tend to agree UnlikeABoss No, I've been here a long time and made many anti-Google comments as well as pro-Google. No one in the right mind would cheer on kernel fragmentation other than those that think Google can do no wrong. destinyhud open up ur comments history and let me see if u made pro google comments. i have a feeling u r a troll UnlikeABoss Yeah, this discussion is going no where. You are not the authority here and the idea that you want to browse my history to make sure I fall in line is creepy as hell. Bye. destinyhud lol i see u dont want to open ur comments history. obvious troll m477 outdated linux i hope this becomes true and linux kernel die Woah, wait a second here. Linux is not outdated, and its death would be terrible for everyone. It's just that it's not the most apt kernel for a mobile device. destinyhud maybe not outdated but not the right fit for mobile devices. destinyhud android sucked when compared to ios.. it was a downgrade compared to ios. why did dev promote android and not desktop linux? u reasoning dont even make sense. UnlikeABoss No, it wasn't a downgrade. destinyhud yes, it was back in android initial release. iOS was better and much more polished at that time. but things changed now. UnlikeABoss "Polished" is not a factor that is used to judge a better OS. There are Linux environments that are much more polished than Windows 10, but that doesn't make desktop Linux better. destinyhud it was both polished and runs better than android at that time. polished was not the only one. it was also polished. android only got better later.. i have used android at that time and it sucked big time. UnlikeABoss You are using today's standards to judge it. If you do that, they both sucked. It worked perfectly fine for the basic things people were using it for at the time. destinyhud they both sucked at that time but android sucked more than iOS at that time. SVem26 I like to think I am in the nerd userbase and I don't care what kernel is used.. can you help me understand why it matters? UnlikeABoss Do you want a brand new obscure kernel in thing that holds most of your sensitive details? TipTop I don't want something that dates back to 90s, is full of zero-days and horrible code contributed by nobodies. UnlikeABoss The idea that it is full of zero days is hilarious. You do realize that the majority of Linux exploits are local, right? Unlike Windows. Yes there is obviously code from the 90s, but very, very little of it. Not to mention that age is not a factor in deciding bad code. The idea that old code is bad code shows your inexperience. By that standard, should we dismiss Chrome because of all the exploits being found in code that was written when it first started? Are we going to create brand new software every few years to purge "old code"? Do you have any idea whatsoever how much Linux has actually changed? Do you have any idea how much of this change is because it's considered a "universal" kernel everyone can use and is focusing on? Do you really think splitting the community over onto another kernel will increase security for either of those kernels? There's a little something called code maturity. There's a reason Microsoft has way less exploits in its kernel today than 10 years ago. They didn't write a new kernel from scratch. Sir_Brizz All OSes are full of vulnerabilities and horrible code written by nobodies. If that is your requirement then you must have gone full luddite by now. ihsan ışık Are you implying that Android got popular because of "nerds" who heard it uses the Linux kernel? UnlikeABoss If you are old enough to know the early days of android you'll know that having every single nerd on the internet promoting Android over iOS most certainly helped get the ball rolling. Once it was pushed, it snowballed into what it is today. m477 Sure. It was the nerds on the internet, not the manufacturers with ads everywhere. Most people still don't know their Galaxy runs Android. UnlikeABoss The giant billboards came YEARS afterwards, cmon. m477 Yes, and that's why Android was so unpopular in the early days. UnlikeABoss What? It was massively popular among all techies for being the open source iOS alternative. m477 You are overestimating the "techies" crowd. Even BlackBerryOS was more popular at the time. Only after the Galaxy S it started to grow, and became popular among normal people. UnlikeABoss Not really. We are talking over a decade ago now, there were far less people on the internet and it was far easier for techies to promote products because everyone was asking their "techie" friend what is best. But these days everyone is an "expert" so that's not as much of a thing. m477 Again, you overestimate how many techies there actually were. Your personal experience is anecdotal. Market shares and sell data are objective. Also, over a decade ago Android was still a camera os, and it wasn't public. UnlikeABoss No, I do not. The further back in time you go, the higher the proportion of techies there were using the internet versus others. People were only just starting to look at buying a smartphone, and asking techies what they should buy. m477 Yes, the concentration on the internet of "techies" on the internet was greater. And? What normal user at the time went to the internet, looked at reviews and said "Oh, look! The HTC magic has Linux! This random guy says its good, so I'm gonna buy it!"? You really think that a bunch of "techies">marketing? A guy saying that his toy-looking HTC G1 is better than the iPhone is more effective than billboards and tv ads? Come on, even Windows Mobile was more popular. It took Samsung's aggressive marketing to make Android popular. UnlikeABoss Windows Mobile and BlackBerry were more popular in the enterprise, that's it. The entire discussion is home users. Also I think there's been some confusion. I wasn't implying that techies on the internet were promoting Android on the internet like a marketing department. I was implying that the internet was very much a "social media" platform for techies to communicate where the majority of them would use Android and mocked the use of iOS. The actual "marketing" happened offline when a normal user would ask their "techie" friend for first time buying advice. It is nothing like that today, and the internet is nothing like the techie community it once was. m477 So, what you're saying is that the internet was a circlejerk of Android users. Ok, and? It didn't affected normal users the slightest, iOS was still more popular until Samsung took Android more seriously. The techie friend thing its only your anecdotal experience, it bears no influence on the market, in the grand scheme of things. I'd even argue that Google's very light marketing did much, much more. Also, the mindless techies that recommended half backed devices instead of better alternatives because "Uh, Linux!!" did more harm than good, both to the users and to Android. UnlikeABoss If you read my OP you'll see my original point was that Google has rode the "Android circlejerk" to popularity, and you can debate how much popularity that added as much as you want. The fact remains, it got the ball rolling. Samsung didn't pick it up "just because", it saw that a lot of people were pushing it. There were several OS at the time it could have used, including sticking to its own. Why bother with Android? Maybe because it wanted to see how much market it could take by appealing to techies? However, if you stand back and look at it, how is this any different from "embrace, extend, extinguish"? Google used that "free marketing" and has now decided to use it's massive popularity to push a different product. (Which has failed in the past and will hopefully fail again). Why hate Microsoft for doing that in the past, but we praise Google for doing it? Why are we excited for something we know nothing about that is creating fragmentation? m477 Samsung had used several OSes, it had Windows Mobile and Phone devices, Symbian devices, and proprietary devices, even Palm OS devices IIRC. They used them all. Android had was the easiest to personalise for them, and create a copy of the best selling product, which was the iPhone, and there was an app market, so they tried to release and market their flagship with it, and market it as broadly as Apple. The first Galaxy (the "non S") was was vastly ignored, because it was as little marketed as all their other devices. The techies crowd was insignificant. The free marketing is just as much as Windows 10 gets for incorporating Ubuntu's bash terminal. What you saw is not really important. I saw lots and lots of Windows Phones in 2010 and 11. Many more than Android devices. Every one I knew had one, and if I had to say which OS was the most popular only based on my personal experience, in my smallish city, I'd obviously would say Windows Phone. Why are you so attached to Linux, excluding all possibilities of giving a possibly better solution a try? The community will just fork the AOSP and continue the development of the Linux branch. UnlikeABoss Cmon, we both know Android was not easier for them to customize than simply using their own OS. No one was recommending it, techie or not, no matter how much they marketed. It's only now they are popular they are trying to slip in their own OS, and still failing. I am not attached to Linux despite people using it as an easy scapegoat to dismiss a discussion critiquing almighty Google. We currently have a situation where most kernel developers focus entirely on Linux, making it virtually the universal kernel. Why are we creating pointless fragmentation there? Why divide that community? Do we honestly believe that a divided community can produce a better kernel, or do we love it because Google is doing it? Would we love it if Microsoft did this? m477 The proprietary OS they used at the time was a Java based thing with a flash interface. Hardly able to compete against iOS. It was easier for them to use the "next Symbian" that they could customise as they wanted, and that also had an app market. If they made, say, Bada, before Android become established and popular, and marketed it as much as they did with their Galaxy S, the market would be very different today. The normal user doesn't care what OS their shiny phone runs, as long as there's facebook. I am a GNU/Linux user since the first half of the 2000s, and I've always critiqued Google for using Linux as a kernel on phones. Linux might be the universal kernel, but smartphones need a more streamlined solution. I don't care if it's Google, the MIT, or Richard Stallman in person to do it. I liked WP8 architecture. Fragmentation is not pointless if it brings benefits to the user. TipTop Nobody cares about your FSF agenda. John Q I think the chief reason Google is not using Linux is that they want a real-time OS (RTOS). Linux is at best a "soft" RTOS, possessing a real-time scheduler but this is still not nearly as real-time as an actual RTOS should be. It would take a very large effort to do that for Linux so it makes sense that Google would want to make their own kernel that they can have full control over. UnlikeABoss Let's ignore the fact that Linux is used in real time car systems for a moment. Could you elaborate on why you think Google would want/need a RTOS on their smartphones? M6 The kernel they're using, 'magenta', is opened source. So who cares if they're using linux or not? Does everyone have to use linux? UnlikeABoss No it doesn't have to be Linux. But who else will use Magenta? Probably no one. So why are we fragmenting the kernel space further? Why would you choose an immature kernel for something as valuable (your data) as your smartphone. Would you trust that? I would much rather developers continue focusing on a single kernel. WesleySmalls But wouldn't Magenta be this single kernel? UnlikeABoss If everyone decided to ditch Linux and focus purely on Magenta as the universal kernel, yes. Will that happen? WesleySmalls Could be, just not overnight. The market was already fairly well developed when Linux arrived in 1991, yet it still managed to become a very, if not the most, important player in the market. It's certainly possible, it will just require proper investment(and neglect of their alternate platforms) and patience to make it work M6 That's some straight up communist shit right there. Let's just work on one thing, because we only need one thing, everything else is redundant! Let's not allow other people to do the same thing in a different way, because competition totally doesn't spur innovation at all. WORPspeed So Andromeda definitely dead or still happening? sleepinlight Pretty sure this IS Andromeda, or at least a part of it. Andromeda was never an official name for anything, it was just the internal project name for some sort of new and/or merged OS. WORPspeed I thought Andromeda specifically referred to merging Android and Chrome OS. So is that specific merger dead or on life-support? John Q Nah, the Android/Chrome merger was just speculation from what Andromeda seemed to be. There was never any concrete evidence to imply that Andromeda was a merger. WORPspeed To quote Androidpolice : "So please, when you see Fuchsia mentioned, or speculation that it "is" Andromeda, know that it is just that: speculation. Last we heard from sources we consider extremely reliable, Android was the basis of Andromeda, and Andromeda would see its commercial debut on a new Pixel laptop later this year. It is possible Google has changed plans around Andromeda, that the initiative itself may have even been scrapped. Though, we have no reason to think so - it's more that we don't know, and haven't heard anything about Andromeda in quite some time." http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/02/15/speculation-around-googles-fuchsia-os-and-andromeda-is-creating-confusion-and-misinformation/ WORPspeed http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/02/15/speculation-around-googles-fuchsia-os-and-andromeda-is-creating-confusion-and-misinformation/ That makes them seem very separate Srujan https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/e7fda716dfcfdca76e200e51a9c9144c72e183c7e76d36b910c20ee0931aee79.gif destinyhud if this replaces android rather than having 2 separate codebase, I am all up for it. splitting the android community is dangerous senor_heisenberg Well if this does end up being what replaces Android or what Android evolves into, I just hope my apps and whatnot are compatible. Ain't got the time or money to be investing into another ecosystem. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman That's a tricky, double-edged sword. I can't fathom they would not support the old apps, or at least the vast majority of them, for exactly that reason. But in doing so it will likely be held back at least slightly from what it can/should be. Backward-compatibility tends to hold everything back. What I'd wager is we won't see this until hardware's powerful enough to make emulating the old system in a VM relatively cheap and easy, with back-end Play Store penalties to developers who don't shift to the new app models, and then slow phase-outs in stages of the older functionality and support until the new OS is running exclusively its own setup. senor_heisenberg That sounds good. Randy Gindy I think Google porting the Android Run-time to Chrome OS was to see if they could do it. morteum This is old news, I'm waiting for Fuchsia 2.0 Barracuda. /s marcusmarcus2 What if they aren't going by Animal names in general but by mammal names.

MJ Thank God it's phones we are talking about and not a desktop PC. marcusmarcus2 That is exactly why Windows XP lasted only a couple years before all computers updated to Windows 7... Seriously though. I'm fine with only getting Android version upgrades phones for 2 years. But they really need to extend out security updates beyond 3 years. Suicide_Note This isn't a desktop OS, not to mention people tend to change phones much more often than their desktops. pfmiller Sure it's not a desktop OS, but no sense pretending that what we have leaves nothing to be desired. And sure people change their phones more often that their desktops, but there's absolutely no reason to change every 2 years. Doby Gillis Which is a problem, Einstein. Suicide_Note Not if you're a Nexus/Pixel owner, Dilbert. Randy Gindy I would generally say there is. Android phones are not supported for nearly as long as an iPhone. The reason being that the chip set manufacturers do not release new drivers. Shelly-Man Vol 2 It's looks pretty neat for a development stage. Rami Well Android has to reach Z someday.

Neither, this is just a side project many developers use to test and work out the feasability of a variety of things. Android is a very well developed environment, and replacing it whole is simply a no-go. Things will just gradually evolve, as they have already done with Dalvik being replaced by ART, for example. Sir_Brizz I don't think you're wrong, but it would be in Google's best interest to start building a non-JVM runtime that apps can run inside with a native language that Google has 100% full control over like Go or Dart.

T-Mobile's color is Magenta, a slightly different purple-y pink color T-Mobile is rumored to be looking into launching their own phone... Coincidence??? Almost certainly, without a doubt yes... But consider... T-Mobile also launched the first Android phone... yoloswag Inspired by the messaging team, Google wants to start working on a 2nd operating system. JG Magenta is designed for "modern phones and modern personal computers with fast processors, non-trivial amounts of ram with arbitrary peripherals doing open ended computation." Modern personal computers huh? I've been interested in Google packing ChromeOS into a LiveCD type set up we could test/install on our own computers... (*Yes, I know of Chromium, haven't tried it yet... But I would prefer it coming direct from Google, faster updates and all that). It could be interesting to try out another of Google's OSs without having to fork over several hundred for new hardware... The only problem would be drivers to support the various hardware. If not modified too much, ChromeOS could possibly use the original Gentoo Linux drivers. But with Fuchsia using its own unique kernel... That might throw things off a bit... I know a few less tech-savey individuals who would probably be more comfortable if the same OS powered their phone, tablet and desktop (should Google opt to replace Android with Fuchsia). Especially if it could run both Android apps and Chrome extensions natively.

Policy Technology Are Minorities Being Left Behind in the Google+ Migration? By Jeneba Ghatt - 2:30pm July 18, 2011 19717 87 SHARE Facebook Twitter For all the talk about US Blacks and Hispanics being the most active users of Twitter and having a substantial membership on Facebook, it seems they may not be quickly migrating to and taking advantage of Google’s latest attempt at breaking into the social media sphere, the Google + project. It is still quite early in the Google+ roll out, but according to a recent analysis, membership on that site has grown 350% since it launched to members of the tech community on an invite-only basis on June 28.   Today, there are reports that over 10 million people have already joined Google +.   But scan the profile images of some of the 940,000 users  listed on the website Find People on Plus and you may notice the dearth of brown and black faces among users.  And even among those who managed to get an early invite, they are like many of the later adopters who do not necessarily “get” the new platform yet and have simply set up a basic profile and have not used it since.  Much of the buzz of the site had to do with the fact that so few people were allowed on in its earliest Beta testing stages. The curious all wanted a golden ticket. The site is used most actively now by the crowd of adventurous tech aficionados who are anxious to see Google finally get the social media thing right.  Google’s previous experiments with Buzz, Orkut, and Wave all failed to take off.   Google+ is slowly creating a new category of user addicts because it is cleaner, so far Ad-Free, and is touted as not being riddled with the same privacy concerns as Facebook, neither is it saddled with applications that litter users streams with gaming updates, for example.    Many Google+ users spend their time sharing ideas and tips on how to navigate the site.  They also lament how much better it is than Facebook in that it allows them more control over with whom they share information and interact, and how much easier it is to filter out those who they want to limit access to certain updates or photos. Who is on Google+ now? It still may be too soon to be taking a critical look at users of a 3-week old site, but since it launched, several articles have examined every aspect of the site including the fact that at one point, only 10% of its users were female.  Because more and more studies reveal that Hispanics and Blacks have higher than average mobile phone ownership and are accessing broadband through their mobile devices, it is not too presumptuous to think those groups would have been early adopters of Google+.  The “digital elite” , the interconnected web of popular bloggers, technical experts and early adopters to the newest technologies,  made up the earliest invitees.  This elite group is quite monolithic and for the most part includes middle to upper middle class professional whites and Asians.   In America anyway, most socialize in racially segregated circles so when Google allowed those on the site to invite their friends, it should come as no surprise then why the second wave of users mirrored the racial make up of the first wave.  Members of the black Technoratti who work with and associate with the general population of tech experts have a  healthy representation on Google+ now as well.  Perhaps, as they began to invite their circle of friends, they helped diversify the site. But beyond these audacious early users,  many are still skeptical about adopting yet another social media platform, and especially one that is not necessarily intuitive.   Google + requires people to categorize their network of family, friends, and colleagues into neat circles and enables users to participate in simultaneous video chat and explore articles categorized by interest. Google+ is not that intuitive as the tech savvy application development community may think.  It certainly is  not as turnkey as Facebook.  With Facebook, anyone can  pretty easily figure out the lay of the land within moments of signing up.  Not so much with Google +.   In response to some user confusion, there have been over two dozen articles published by leading tech publications and sites explaining how to navigate the site.  A killer competitor to Facebook  shouldn’t be so difficult to circumnavigate. And even then, many have already invested lots of  time cultivating a home on Facebook, building photo albums and “friending” long lost classmates and relatives.  It will take a lot to get many reluctant and less active  folks to adopt Google +.  So the question remains whether it will survive the initial rounds of early users, folks who are eager for its success and will more quickly appreciate its benefits. But then again, not all people “got” Twitter initially either.  Minorities slowly gravitated to it as well and have since taken over,  some reports say.   An Edison Research annual report on Twitter  showed that Blacks represented 25% of Twitter users, roughly twice their share of the population in general.  A Pew Research Center’s Internet & American Life Project report showed slightly lower usage statistics, but still impressive, indicating usage among blacks and Hispanics proportionate to their population at 13% and 18%, respectively. Google+  shares user demographics based on region of the country, profession, and gender but not race.   When Google opens the site to all users, we may likely see more minorities migrate over but not as quickly as one would think or some would want. Social media expert Lindsay Holmes, owner of LCH Business, a branding & marketing company, says while Google+ may be a competitor to Facebook, she doesn’t think Google+ will be Twitter killer. “People who get Twitter and use it for marketing won’t abandon it that fast because they know its utility and Google+ can’t compete,” Holmes said. ” If there is anything that will slow minorities down from adopting any new technology that would be  intimidation and once they get over that initial hurdle, they will get on.” Holmes said when people are able to realize the usability of Google+, they will join more when it becomes available to more.  “We are people that need usability and understand usability,” she added. It is quite possible then that Hispanics and Blacks, as a group, may be among the last to join the site if it indeed lasts through the long haul and becomes a viable competitor to Facebook.  They may be less likely than other groups to join the bandwagon and try a new platform.  They may remain loyal users of Twitter and Facebook as Asian and Whites, and tech savvy higher income minorities join Google+. Google+, the place to go to escape the  “ghettoization” of other social media platforms In essence, if  Google+ indeed is able to court away some of Facebook’s 750 Million users and black and brown users adopt later, we may be looking at a repeat of what happened with MySpace.  According Researcher Danah Boyd, scores of more affluent and white users abandoned MySpace for Facebook partly because there was an impression that it had become too “ghetto” and used by blacks and Hispanics.     She discussed this issue back in 2007 in a controversial chapter of a forthcoming book addressing “digital” white flight, the Digital Race Anthology. In White Flight in Networked Publics?  How Race and Class Shaped American Teen Engagement with MySpace and  Facebook, the Microsoft Research and Harvard Berkman Center for Internet and Society scholar conducted ethnographic research and used anecdotal conversations with over 100 youth to conclude there was a “white flight” from MySpace because it had become too brown. Currently, Blacks and Hispanics still have a predominant presence on MySpace and are represented on that site at a disproportionate rate at 26% and 45%, respectively, when they are 12% and 16% in the population as a whole.  Some have speculated, though not gone on record saying, that Rupert Murdoch sold off MySpace, which was once valued at $12 billion for a mere $35 million because he saw no value in a tool being used primarily by minorities and poor whites.  Some critics of Murdoch say MySpace went down hill after Murdoch’s Newscorp acquired the once popular site, first used by nascent bands and performing groups to promote their albums and songs.  He failed to sufficiently invest in it to make it competitive to new sites – Facebook launched one year after MySpace- and then quickly abandoned it when its cream users stopped using it.  A more plausible explanation may be that NewsCorp simply wanted to free up some cash to acquire a majority stake in UK’s Sky Broadcasting, that MySpace was too prone to viruses, hackers and spam than Facebook or because Facebook was simply more attractive options for users.  But those who stayed, did so by choice.  As one blogger on the Project Economic Refugee pointed out, what Latinos loved about MySpace was the freedom to be creative, everything Facebook isn’t and why they did not join it when everyone else was. Facebook  is used widely by all races these days as is Twitter. But as mentioned,  recent reports indicate higher than average Twitter use among Blacks and Hispanics and data indicate this may because they are more likely using their mobile devices to access social media than whites. According to a new report by the Pew Research Center’s Internet & American LIfe Project, 44% of African Americans and Hispanics say they own a smartphone, compared to just 30% of non-Hispanic whites. Using this type of data as a guide, several bloggers and tech watchers have pondered whether Black and Hispanics use of mobile devices will enable them to leapfrog over other groups and help them bridge the digital divide. While idealistic and hopeful, that outcome would hardly be realized so long as Blacks and Hispanics are slow to navigate to new services. Are minorities positioned to be left behind? Since Google+ was rolled out, a benefit of being an early adopter is being able to access and be visible to some of the top players in the digital, programming and application world.  Those who are followed by millions on Twitter, are only being “followed” by hundreds or thousands on Google+.  When followers pose a query as a follow up to a post by a more popular user, they are more likely to get a direct answer.  There is interaction. Right now is the peak and prime time to get on, start exploring, learn from and exchange with leaders in your field you may not ordinarily have easy access to on other platforms.  Once the site is opened to millions that accessibility will dissipate most likely. Many of the current inhabitants are dreading the inevitable.  When news broke this week that Google plans to soon open up the social media tool to everyone, some Google+ users let out a collective sigh. “There goes the neighborhood,” one person commented on the stream of noted Tech writer Mike Elgan. Another added, “As soon as Google+ is open, the quality will drop.” These retorts show that Google+ perhaps , for a few, is a place to escape the not so pleasant aspects of Twitter, including users who in the past have been said to be degrading the medium by using it to create and discuss crass, misogynistic, racist and even violent trending topics.  While some users may want to be exclusionary, Google can’t afford to shun anyone if it truly plans to put a dent into Facebook’s 750 Million user database. It will have to be inclusive of broad demographics, encourage them to navigate over and make it useful and easy for them to stay and set up shop in a similar fashion as the earliest adopters. When the site is eventually opened who is to say even whether minority groups and younger users will wander over and join immediately?  It may not matter. Google+ may bolt out the starting gate, gain momentum and slowly die out just like other social media sites that have tried to rival and best Facebook.   Only time will tell.

Amazon has grabbed more than two-thirds of the fast-growing market in the US for connected speakers with its family of Alexa-powered Echo devices, a survey showed today. The survey by research firm eMarketer found Amazon's Echo speakers held 70.6 per cent of the US market, compared with 23.8 per cent for Google Home and 5.6 per cent for others including Lenovo, LG, Harmon Kardon and Mattel. The report said 35.6 million Americans will use a voice- activated assistant device at least once a month this year, a jump of 128.9 per cent over last year. According to eMarketer, heaviest users of digital assistants are between the ages of 25 and 34, which represent 26.3 per cent of virtual assistant users. The research firm said it expects Amazon's market share to fall slightly in the coming years but that the online retail giant will remain the dominant player in the category for the foreseeable future. "Consumers are becoming increasingly comfortable with the technology, which is driving engagement," said Martin Utreras, vice president of forecasting at eMarketer. "As prices decrease and functionality increases, consumers are finding more reasons to adopt these devices." Amazon does not disclose sales figures for its speakers, which are powered by artificial intelligence and can serve as connected home hubs. But analysts at Consumer Intelligence Research Partners estimate that 10.7 million Americans have purchased an Amazon Echo device since its late-2014 introduction. Awareness of Amazon Echo increased dramatically in the past year, and Echo owners use it as a voice-responsive Internet query device and household controller, in addition to a streaming music speaker, according to CIRP. The CIRP report said 52 per cent of the Amazon devices sold were the low-priced Echo Dot, which retails for around USD 50. Separately today, Samsung-owned Harman Kardon announced the release of its new Invoke speaker powered by Microsoft's digital assistant Cortana and integrating Skype for making calls using the device.The voice-activated speaker "can play your favorite music, manage calendars and activities, set reminders, check traffic, deliver the latest news and much more," according to a statement. tags #Amazon #Lenovo #LG #World News Related news Business Toshiba tells Western Digital not to interfere with chip unit sale May 09, 2017 10:32 AM Business Amazon leads surging connected speakers market: Survey May 09, 2017 07:45 AM Business Uber setting up artificial intelligence lab in Toronto May 09, 2017 07:45 AM Business IMF says Asia facing risks from rise in protectionism May 09, 2017 07:45 AM Business BOJ governor expects to meet price target with current monetary easing May 09, 2017 07:35 AM Business Apple just got its most bullish forecast yet: Worth $1 trillion in a year May 08, 2017 11:29 PM Business China says China-Pakistan Economic Corridor attracted USD 46 billion investments May 08, 2017 09:50 PM Business Juncker warns Macron French spend too much money May 08, 2017 09:45 PM Business Warren Buffett says deal partner 3G follows 'standard capitalist formula' May 08, 2017 08:50 PM News Most Popular Top News Keep some cash in hand as analysts raise alarm; 10 stocks which could give up to 20% return Hudco IPO: A low risk shelter for investors RERA effect: Homebuyers can now exit the real estate project at any stage India's Rs 2 trillion economy likely to double in next 8 years; huge opportunity for investors: Sunil Singhania Looking to invest in banking space? 5 stocks which could give up to 30% return Earnings to lead next leg of bull market; 4 stocks that can give up to 40% returns Market Live: Sensex, Nifty continue to remain rangebound; midcaps, metals surge AAP crisis LIVE: Will reveal one of country's biggest conspiracies today, says Kejriwal see more Video of the day Auto ancillaries & logistics may see good earnings; wary of hsg fin cos: Nilesh Shah Portfolio Markets Watchlist Live TV Show Currencies Commodities Fixed Income Personal Finance Mutual Fund Stock Market India IPO Global Market Budget 2017 BSE Sensex Forum News Business Markets Stocks Economy Mutual Funds Personal Finance IPO Startups Stocks: A | B | C | D | E | F | G | H | I | J | K | L | M | N | O | P | Q | R | S | T | U | V | W | X | Y | Z | Others Mutual Funds: A | B | C | D | E | F | G | H | I | J | K | L | M | N | O | P | Q | R | S | T | U | V | W | X | Y | Z Visit the App Store to see all our apps: Tools Retirement Planning EMI Calculator SIP Calculator SIP Planner Useful Links Budget 2016 Live Sensex Public Sector Banks Best Portfolio Manager Small Savings Schemes Bonds Specials Master Your Money Game Changers Travelcafe SME Special Investment Watch PowerYourTrade MoneyBhai Focus Grow My Money GE Step Ahead SME Step Up Feedback & Info feedback@moneycontrol.com About us | Contact Us | Feedback | Disclaimer | Privacy Statement | Terms of Use | Careers | Financial Terms (Glossary) | FAQs | Sitemap | RSS Feed Copyright © e-Eighteen.com Ltd.

And while Google is working hard on the next major Android release, and probably one or two releases after that, it’s also cooking up something else that aimed at smartphones. Google is working on Fuchsia, an OS that isn’t based on Linux like Android and Chrome OS, but rather is based on Google’s own microkernel called “Magenta.” According to Google, Magenta is aimed at “modern phones and modern personal computers with fast processors, non-trivial amounts of RAM with arbitrary peripherals doing open-ended computation.” While Fuchsia is nowhere near ready for public use, it does now have a user interface called Armadillo, and the folks at Ars Technica downloaded and compiled the Fuchsia UI into an Android APK and loaded it onto an Android device. This gives us a super early look at the UI. You can also see a video of the UI put together by Hotfix at the top of this post. The Fuchsia UI starts with a round profile picture that, when tapped, will show controls for sound and brightness, toggles for Airplane Mode, Do Not Disturb, and rotation lock, as well as info like your Wi-Fi and mobile networks. Above this profile picture is a list of recent apps displayed in cards, and below it is a Google Now-style scrolling list of suggestions. Tapping on the recent apps cards will launch it into full screen mode. You can also long press on a card and drag it around, and when you combine it with other cards, you can split your screen with multiple apps, including a 50/50 split, a 75/25 split, a 33/33/33 split, or you can even run four apps at once. It’s worth noting that Fuchsia is still in early days, and so its future is unclear. Fuchsia developer Travis Geiselbrecht has said that the OS isn’t a “toy thing” or a “dumping ground of a dead thing that we don’t care about anymore.” Things can always change, though, especially since we’re likely at least a few years out from seeing Fuchsia on any kind of hardware meant for public use. The early UI that we’re seeing in these Fuchsia screenshots is interesting. You can see some Google design in the cards and some of the other design elements, but the UI is different than those currently found on Android and iOS. The multi-window support is also pretty neat and could be handy on a tablet, especially since it’ll let you easily size three or even four apps running side-by-side.  To see even more of this early Fuchsia UI, hit up the link below.

Although we do not know what Google plans to do with this new OS, the pre-alpha build does give us a quick peek into how it may work one day when completed. What do you think of Fuchsia’s user interface so far? UAG Samsung Galaxy S8 Cases The biggest difference between Fuchsia and Android (besides how it looks) is the underlying software. Android runs on top of a custom Linux base while Fuchsia is powered by Google’s “Dart” programming language. What this means is that instead of having to work around Linux, Google can use its own in-house software and make the mobile operating system do almost anything it might like. From what we’ve seen, Fuchsia looks to have taken UI influences from Material Design, Chrome OS, and even some aspects of Android. The main screen shows the user’s profile and allows the user to jump into a quick settings section. From here, a swipe down offers what looks like a card-based application drawer. A swipe up from the profile page brings up what looks like a Google Search section that offers recommendations similar to Google Now. Obviously, Fuchsia is far from complete. While the video embedded below shows a walkthrough of the OS in which everything looks polished and smooth, this build is more of an outline of what is to come than anything else. We will most likely have to wait quite a while before we see Google potentially do anything with Fuchsia. So, what do you think of Fuchsia? Do you think it will beat out Android in the looks department? Answer the poll below and let us know your thoughts in the comments!

(Amanda Cowan/The Columbian) By Andy Matarrese, Columbian Breaking News Reporter Published: May 8, 2017, 6:34 PM A   A Vancouver police arrested a Vancouver man suspected of possessing child pornography following a monthslong investigation. Darrell Leonard Velasco, 61, was arrested Friday on suspicion of possessing and viewing child pornography and possession of methamphetamine and cocaine. Velasco made a first appearance Monday in Clark County Superior Court. According to a probable cause statement filed with the court, Google sent an automated message in October to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, which maintains a tip line to detect and prevent trafficking of child pornography over the internet. The center forwards those reports to law enforcement agencies. One such tip was forwarded to the Vancouver Police Department’s Digital Evidence Cybercrime Unit. Using data from Google’s report, investigators linked identifying information to Velasco. To get more information, they applied for, and received, a warrant to search his information with Google, CenturyLink, Facebook and T-Mobile. The search yielded communications between Velasco and others regarding sharing child pornography, along with chatter from others trying to secure drugs, the police said in court records. Officers searched his home, in the 10000 block of Northeast 21st Street, in the Burton Ridge neighborhood, last Friday. In a recorded interview after his arrest, Velasco told officers the messages the investigators found were his, and that he once kept a collection of child pornography. He also admitted to occasionally supplying street drugs to close associates, according to court records. He directed officers to a cabinet in his home, where they found items that tested positive for cocaine and methamphetamine. Velasco is being held on $35,000 bail. His arraignment was scheduled for May 19.   Andy Matarrese Columbian Breaking News Reporter  360-735-4457  @col_cops  Send an Email Please take a second to review our community guidelinesCommunity guidelines Blogs Staff Blogs Home All Politics is Local Blazer Banter Brews in Clark Cannabis Chronicles Clark County Faces Digital Desk Family Room Ghost Stories High School Sports HealthBeat History Political Beat Tailgate Talk Community It's the Fair!

Google's "Fuchsia" operating system is taking shape with a new design Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/08 10:01am PDTMay 8, 2017 29 Plus 1 on G+ 243 Share on Facebook 78 Share on Twitter Total Shares350 Development Google News We first talked about Fuchsia, a new operating system being developed at Google, back in August (in fact, it was my first post here). At the time, there wasn't much to get excited about besides the potential - it only had a command-line interface. Now the project has a snazzy new, but clearly unfinished, interface. Summary of Fuchsia First, it's worth going over exactly what Fuchsia is, because it's been quite a while since we talked about it. As opposed to all of Google's other OSes, such as Android and Chrome OS, Fuchsia uses the company's new 'Magenta' kernel instead of Linux. According to the project's documentation, Magenta is designed for "modern phones and modern personal computers with fast processors, non-trivial amounts of ram with arbitrary peripherals doing open ended computation." Magenta's apps and the system interface are written with Google's Flutter SDK, which was initially designed to create cross-platform apps for iOS and Android. Flutter applications are written in Dart, the company's home-grown programming language. All of the system and apps are rendered by 'Escher,' which uses OpenGL or Vulkan to display everything. The 'Armadillo' interface So, on to the new stuff. Fuchsia's system UI has a new name - 'Armadillo.' Ars Technica was able to compile Armadillo into an Android APK, since it is written with the above-mentioned Flutter SDK. The interface doesn't really do anything besides looking pretty, but it does give us an idea of what the finished product could look like. The home screen is a vertical list, with a profile picture, the time, and a battery indicator in the center. Tapping the profile picture brings up something similar to Android's Quick Settings, with toggles for auto-rotate, do not disturb, Airplane Mode, and so on. Above the profile picture is the 'Story,' which the documentation describes as "a set of apps and/or modules that work together for the user to achieve a goal." Currently, this works similarly to Android's Recents screen. Users will also be able to combine stories into a 'Story Cluster.' This is what dragging a Story card into split-screen looks like. Dragging a Story card onto another one triggers a split-screen mode. The user can split an app 50/50 vertically or horizontally, drag in another app for a 33/33/33 split, or even have a tab bar appear for using all the open apps in full-screen. You can even have two apps split vertically next to two other split apps, seen below. This is far more flexible than Android's current multi-tasking functionality, but whether or not it will stay this way is uncertain. Below the profile picture is a panel resembling Google Now, with a placeholder search bar and suggestion cards. Armadillo's documentation says, "a suggestion is a representation of an action the user can take to augment an existing story or to start a new one. [The] suggestion contains enough information to create the visual representation of that concept." So maybe they will work more like an app launcher? It's hard to tell at this point. The Google Now panel, showing Fuchsia's keyboard. Keep in mind that all of this is subject to change, as the Armadillo interface (and the rest of Fuchsia OS) is still under heavy development. It's also hard to tell what Google's plans are for the operating system. Will it be neglected to Internet-of-Things devices and other basic hardware, or will it some day replace Android altogether? We'll have to wait and see.

Suicide_Note Because Google can. Corbin Davenport Ron from Ars Technica put it best: "Fuchsia really seems like a project that asks 'how would we design Android today, if we could start over?' It's a brand-new, Google-developed kernel running a brand-new, Google-developed SDK that uses a brand-new, Google-developed programming language and it's all geared to run Google's Material Design interface as quickly as possible. Google gets to dump Linux and the GPL, it can dump Java and the problems it caused with Oracle, and Google can basically insulate itself from all of Android's upstream projects and bring all the development in-house. Doing such a thing on the scale of Android today would be a massive project." makapav Would it still be open source? Also, what would happen to all the existing APKs? Corbin Davenport Fuchisa is completely open source right now. As for running Android apps, maybe Google will add some kind of stop-gap compatibility layer for running Android apps, like Chrome OS has. destinyhud read the article Suicide_Note Perhaps instead of replacing Android, this will *become* Android, as in Android P or Q? Or be the merger of Android/Chrome? m477 I could see that as Android 10. Definitely too early for P. morteum I wonder if the reason it is called "Armadillo" is because they're starting from A again, but this time they're using animals instead of desserts. Christopher Bement I think it's a smart plan, based on the guess that there's more animals to pick from in the world than tasty desserts. teolinux Ubuntu docet Paul "Tasty treats," not necessarily desserts. That said, armadillos could be a tasty treat. I won't judge. MJ I have heard desserts and candy used before which are wrong but "tasty treats" is a new one for me. To be more accurate, Android names are actually all confectionery foods. A "tasty treat" could be a slice of pizza (aka Android S). LOL Randy Gindy Armadillo is the name of the UI not the OS build itself. Matt74UK Smooth on the inside, crunchy on the outside. Armadillo ! (a few UK people of a certain age may get that). John Doe Idk this is a whole new OS with a new kernel, I doubt this will be done with an OTA update for Android. Mantas Pakėnas Even nowadays, some of Android's new functionality cannot be done via OTA updates (like dual system partitions, forced encryption I believe, etc). To make a completely hard cut sometime when this is ready, and if it's meant to replace Android, is not completely unimaginable. As is updating via OTA. If apple was able to change their file system via OTA, I don't see why changing most of the parts would not be possible. However, nobody aside from Google would do it, almost guaranteed :) Suicide_Note It could likely be done for Pixel devices, and possibly for future devices released after this new version of the OS rolls out. Adrian Meredith quite possibly, after all there no reason it couldn't also run android apps jonathan What they need to do is make this googles very own os for their pixel line and leave android for the oems Suicide_Note Not a chance. To much name recognition with Android for Google to drop it in favor of something else specific to the Pixel lineup. Dallas King Android Z confirmed! Suicide_Note More like Android A for Armadillo. m477 APK plz (no, really, I want a compiled apk the demo) Maxwell “Max” Weinbach https://github.com/fuchsia-mirror/sysui MJ Your link wasn't what the OP asked for... Maxwell “Max” Weinbach the only way to get the APK is to compile it yourself, so I linked to the Github page to a place to download the files to compile. The closest they will get. MJ Than you should have replied there is no known APK or not at all. Maxwell “Max” Weinbach It does not matter that much. I am building the APK right now. Once it is done I will post it. Here is the link on how to compile it. http://www.hotfixit.net/single-post/2017/05/03/How-to-build-Armadillo MJ Don't waste your time... They updated that article with an download of the APK. Maxwell “Max” Weinbach thanks. they just did that. I still compiled it myself though. I will try to get more out of it while I have the Sysui downloaded. Michel R. https://www.androidfilehost.com/?w=files&flid=178684 there you go MJ http://www.hotfixit.net/single-post/2017/05/03/How-to-build-Armadillo Latex beats nudity More of Proprietary code ? No thank you, we already had enough with this Pixel crud. I hope this OS dies quicker or become a chromebook OS. m477 It's open source. Latex beats nudity It's OSS but just like Android It'll be more heavily dependent on the google APIs to make it work. Look at the Pixel SysUI, Just being OSS doesn't make it open source... It's Google's OS not a Linux Based one. If this is going to replace Android It's doomsday on multiple levels. destinyhud billions of people dont care if its running linux kernel or not. maybe very few like u might. do iphone users care why kernel it runs. none of them care. u r just noise tbh Latex beats nudity Billions of people don't code. You are being a kool-aid joke tbh. destinyhud exaclt only few code and even on that few many dont care if it runs linux or not. look at iphone there are more dev there and yet they dont care for kernel. u r delusional in ur own world m477 Android it's already been on a Google-dependent road for years. I don't think this is going to change either way. An Angry Chihuahua https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/magenta/+/master/docs/getting_started.md heres the source code. do some research my dude WitnessG Imagining this running on a Google made processor is exciting. Badouken If this was the OS for the Pixel 2 alongside a Google made processor I think id cry! WitnessG Yeah I don't see this coming out for at least another 2-3 years. Badouken Indeed, but we can dream! ha Suicide_Note Maybe the Pixel 3 or 4 will see the dream become reality. Suicide_Note I'm betting this is what we'll see in a couple years time. As another commenter stated, starting with Armadillo could be Google's way of starting from the beginning (letter A codename), since there's more animal babes to use for each letter than there are dessert names to use. Timothy Vreeland You are getting the furries excited. Nomaan Armadillo should be compared to holo/material and not to dessert names. nachofrand What makes you think Google would be good at making SoCs? They're a software company and don't have the hardware expertise for hardcore ASIC development like that. Granted they can hire people, but in the end, does it matter? They're going to use ARM either way. UnlikeABoss Google fanboyism. The same reason he's excited over a brand new OS. He knows absolutely nothing about it, short of the fact that it will create more fragmentation not only in the OS space, but also the kernel space. So all we know are negative things so far. This is what we call exciting now is it? Why? Just because Google is doing it? If Microsoft made this exact same announcement, would we all be excited? Oh dear. Zsolt V No, because essentially everybody loathes Microsoft. Almost nobody's life would be worse if Microsoft vanished. marcusmarcus2 Don't they design and build their own servers to use for all their websites? Seems like those hardware work well for them. Sergii Pylypenko It's one thing to assemble the server using off-the-shelf components, or even to order a custom motherboard. It's a very different thing to design and manufacture your own chips. marcusmarcus2 I'm not saying it is the same, just that they are not only software experts. Them designing and building the servers show they do have hardware expertise that could assist them in doing the same to chips. Zsolt V Except Google's servers are not assembled from off the shelf components. Haven't been for a few years now. Roy What about TPU? Adrian Vovk Samsung Exynos devices are faster than Snapdragon, iPhones seem underpowered but are extremely snappy, etc. The point is that making both the software and hardware leads to a very fast ecosystem. Also, Google are making the TPU for neural networks nachofrand Yes, as expected. Exynos is faster than Snapdragon on the Galaxy phones, but put an Exynos in another phone...oh wait, you can't. That's the whole entire point. Snapdragon SoCs are general purpose SoCs and can be used for a multitude of phones so they're not custom tuned to every phone individually. Exynos have very specific power rails and the chip is made specifically for that phone. The thing is, sure this is better, but it's marginal and hardly worth talking about. They both use the same ARM architecture so performance gains are pretty negligible. Besides that, this is how Samsung makes money....off of device sales. Google doesn't make money that way. That isn't their business model so at this point it doesn't make sense for them to build their own SoCs when they could just work closer with hardware companies. They make their own TPUs because it aligns with their business model. Adrian Vovk The instruction set doesn't really matter? I can have a 6700k and a 6500k and the 6700k will perform much better even though they are both amd64. With what Google is doing with the Pixels (still as snappy as day one here) I'm pretty sure they can optimize it further than Samsung does. They have made it run smoother in some cases on a chip that they didn't manufacture. If they made their own chip it would allow them many freedoms that they otherwise don't have = easier design of the device. I brought up the TPUs because that is experience in chip manufacturing Jason What makes you say iPhones are under powered ? Apples chips are some of the fastest around and are extremely powerful. Adrian Vovk Specs wise. They have much worse specs on paper and it would lead to a slower experience, except Apple can optimize it because they make both the chip and the OS Stephen Sharp They could use Risc-V and have to pay to license absolutely nothing, while being able to make processors purpose built for their OS Randy Gindy That would be an interesting move. Stephen Sharp Indeed, I really want Risc-V to succeed as an open ISA nachofrand They could. But in my opinion, it's unlikely. Google isn't trying to compete with Samsung and Apple in device sales and that isn't their business model. People using their services so they can show ads is their business model. It doesn't make sense for Google to make their own SoC when others are already doing a good job. Plus, if they went to RISC-V then what? What about the modem? They have to buy a standalone modem from Qualcomm or Intel. Now you have to hire system integration and test engineers to make sure the modem is working with your SoC. Oh and then you need a whole firmware team to control the modem. At that point, buy a full blown SoC with the modem on chip. Stephen Sharp Eh you lost me at "Pixel phone" and all the other hardware they sell. Google also is a Platinum member of the Risc-V foundation, and if there is a direction they are going, more control or less control, I would guess it's "more". But that's just a guess nachofrand Hardware isn't even close to the same thing as asic development. IC design is a different world. Granted they do some custom hardware, but SoCs are a much much larger feat. It's still a possibility they do so, but it doesn't make sense with their current business model imo. Captain On! 1 - Google has stated that they're going to make their own silicon for the Pixels in time. 2 - Google actually owns/operates the world's most powerful quantum computer. They know how to make chips. Randy Gindy That quantum computer was built by DWave though Angel I read (somewhere don’t remember) that they have three different quantum computers systems. One from DWave and two home-produced. From those two, one was made by engineers and not that disimilar from DWave in its operations. The other was made by physicists and uses a different approach. nachofrand 1. I could be wrong, but I've only read that they plan on working closer with chip manufacturers. 2. Google didn't make that computer. Even if they did, quantum is so different those skills don't even translate. Romario Maxwell Google made their own custom ASIC called the Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) for their AI/Machine Learning needs on their cloud platform. See https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2016/05/Google-supercharges-machine-learning-tasks-with-custom-chip.html and https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2017/04/quantifying-the-performance-of-the-TPU-our-first-machine-learning-chip.html nachofrand Sure, although a TPU is just an accelerator. Think of it as the hexagon DSP inside of the Snapdragon SoC. That's like 1/10 of the entire chip. SoC design is much larger. Timothy Vreeland How many examples of hardware design do people have to point out before you stop? Sure the hardware they worked on previously isn't exactly the same... But before they started the hardware they are currently working on, they worked on previous hardware that wasn't the same as what they are doing now. They have shown they are competent in designing many kinds of hardware. Or do you suggest a company can only build one kind of hardware and nothing else for all eternity? How did Samsung make it's current in-house chips? Did they go to ARM college? Have they been making ARM chips since the dawn of time? No. They put together some teams and got to work, so stop blabbing and being negative. sweenish Their AI that finally beat the world's top Go players was running on custom Google chips. It's not like they don't know how. Pixelexel Imagine a Google Pixel with a Google made processor, with Fuschia, with Project Fi with Google WiFi powered by Google fiber. If I'd have this, my life would be complete. Iamsecond Ha, no. A Google processor? Supported for 18 months, then replaced with a new processor that performs half as well (but has stickers.) Does not fully process Android code, because at Google one hand doesn't even know the other hand is there, let alone talk to it. Has 20 cores (only 2 enabled outside US for 'reasons.') Has a dedicated co-processor to enable ads in every app, even those that previously didn't have them. Jason Google can't even get a phone out the door without issues and you want them to make the chips too...lol. I'll pass. UnlikeABoss "In house kernel instead of Linux". Yeah, hopefully this dies in a thousand pits of fire. "Hey Linux guys, you know how you've helped us make billions over the years with a free open source kernel? Well, we were just using you to get the "nerd" userbase. Now we own the market thanks to you guys promoting its use of Linux, we will gradually phase you out." .... m477 I hope not. Linux is not really a kernel made with smartphone in minds. I don't care for being a fan of a kernel over another. UnlikeABoss Yeah. I'd much rather use a brand new untested kernel (and all the teething issues that will come with it) in my smartphone than a mature, stable one that's hacked on by hundreds and thousands of people every month. I mean, it's just a smartphone, we don't need it to be a secure environment, right? Let's just make a nice obscure kernel that no one else will use, and just say "but but it's open source!!! love us because we are Google kk". ... ihsan ışık I'm sorry but it just looks like you are a huge Linux fan and are just against change to me. UnlikeABoss Looks can be deceiving. If you're going to fling around the Linux fanboy term, i'll fling around the Google fanboy term, and that will surely be a nice constructive argument that we will both want to continue. m477 So, in 10 years we should still be using an unoptimised kernel like Linux, because anything newer is, well, newer? UnlikeABoss Yeah, because Linux hasn't changed at all in 10 years... m477 Yes, it changed a lot, and it still has many of the same problems, which are intrinsically bound to its structure. It's not a kernel well suited for mobile devices. UnlikeABoss You think the solution is to throw it out the window and start from scratch? I disagree. I'd much rather continue improving the Linux kernel, simply because of all the eyes it will always have on its code. jonathan Play nice ladies lol m477 With this mentality we wouldn't have Linux at all. Why start anything, while we can continue this other thing which purpose was completely different? A mircokenel is more well suited than a monolitic kernel to a mobile devices, both in terms of performance and security. No matter how much you improve Linux, it will never be a microkernel. UnlikeABoss Smartphones don't need a micro kernel in 2017. You could make that argument 7 years ago. Linux can be compiled with the required drivers just like it always could. m477 I made that argument 7 years ago. They always needed something different from Linux. The fact that specific, even proprietary drivers have to be integrated in the kernel (since Android lacks an abstraction layer) is on of the problems of the interaction Android-Linux. destinyhud why havent the nerds made linux on pc's a bigger market share if they were the one who made android a global leader UnlikeABoss No nerd is promoting Linux on the desktop. All social media used to be full of people promoting Android over iOS, these days there's no need to. destinyhud why havent they promoted desktop?? just wondering why they did for android but not for desktop.. linux on desktop was an underdog for decades. android was not popular because of kernal. android became popular because it was opensource and was the only viable competition to ios. people dont care what kernel it runs. UnlikeABoss No nerd worth their salt would promote an environment that would be a downgrade from Windows. Android was not a downgrade from iOS at any point in time, it had a very equal playing field. There's a difference between promoting a good solid FOSS kernel where possible, and promoting an agenda. m477 Android was not a downgrade from iOS at any point in time By this, I get that you never used Android and iOS side by side in 2009-10. UnlikeABoss You clearly value different things. The hackability alone made it an upgrade through its lifetime. m477 The same can be said for GNU/Linux on desktop. UnlikeABoss No it can't, because hackability =/= app availability. i.e. The hackability on Linux desktop doesn't make it win over it's lack of apps, where that isn't an issue on Android. m477 App availability was horrible in the early days, compared to iOS. Even Symbian had more apps. UnlikeABoss That was fine since the early days didn't consist of using your smartphone for very much, due to under powered hardware. Techies didn't go around saying "use iOS because we can all take selfies and stick filters on it". m477 iOS devices didn't have front cameras until mid 2010. The system was better, faster, smoother, the interface was coesive, there were many more apps, and the jailbreak community, to address the techie audience you like to go on about so much, was very, very good. There were tweaks and modifications that even the wildest Android custom ROM didn't have at the time. Android was objectively a downgrade, as much as Linux was on desktop. UnlikeABoss Calling jailbraik an advantage over a FOSS OS is pretty hilarious. iOS wasn't popular because it was better, it was popular because of the amount of people getting their advice from paid employees in store. "Buy iOS so we get a commission". m477 iPhone was more popular for various reasons: marketing, having 2 years of advantage, and, yes, more marketing. But it was also better than Android, as an OS. What benefit did Android bring, with it being opensource, compared to iOS, even to a "techie"? The dev community was laughable in the early days. Why GNU/Linux on desktop was not promoted by "techies" (which is false) and Android was, even if their shortcomings were identical? destinyhud u live in a dream world. even most dev dont care about kernel. what they care about the dev platform. I am a dev and i dont care for the kernel UnlikeABoss If you're talking from the perspective of an app developer then ofcourse you don't care about the kernel, you care about which platform will make you the most money... destinyhud exactly. no one care what kernel it runs.. all dev care is what platform make money. so who is this nerd who care about kernel if most dont care about the kernel.. yeah very very few.. infact rare like u UnlikeABoss Techie == Technology Enthusiast. You can sit here and tell me that you would use the best dev environment all you want but the truth is if the iOS dev environment was awful you'd still suck it up and use it to make your money. I'm not sure how you can class yourself as an enthusiast at that point. destinyhud ever wonder why no one is up voting u and upvoting many of my comments? because what u say is BS. its that simple. I am up for ditching outdated linux if the new kernal is modern and build for modern devices. most dont care for this very few techies.. i hope this becomes true and linux kernel die.. UnlikeABoss "Ever wonder why Google fanboys upvote pro Google content and not anti-Google content?" No, no I don't wonder that. How dare someone critique a pointless change by Google, causing unnecessary fragmentation. Burn them! destinyhud u must be new here.. look at anti google comments here when they make stupid changes but if they make welcome changes people tend to agree UnlikeABoss No, I've been here a long time and made many anti-Google comments as well as pro-Google. No one in the right mind would cheer on kernel fragmentation other than those that think Google can do no wrong. destinyhud open up ur comments history and let me see if u made pro google comments. i have a feeling u r a troll UnlikeABoss Yeah, this discussion is going no where. You are not the authority here and the idea that you want to browse my history to make sure I fall in line is creepy as hell. Bye. destinyhud lol i see u dont want to open ur comments history. obvious troll m477 outdated linux i hope this becomes true and linux kernel die Woah, wait a second here. Linux is not outdated, and its death would be terrible for everyone. It's just that it's not the most apt kernel for a mobile device. destinyhud maybe not outdated but not the right fit for mobile devices. destinyhud android sucked when compared to ios.. it was a downgrade compared to ios. why did dev promote android and not desktop linux? u reasoning dont even make sense. UnlikeABoss No, it wasn't a downgrade. destinyhud yes, it was back in android initial release. iOS was better and much more polished at that time. but things changed now. UnlikeABoss "Polished" is not a factor that is used to judge a better OS. There are Linux environments that are much more polished than Windows 10, but that doesn't make desktop Linux better. destinyhud it was both polished and runs better than android at that time. polished was not the only one. it was also polished. android only got better later.. i have used android at that time and it sucked big time. UnlikeABoss You are using today's standards to judge it. If you do that, they both sucked. It worked perfectly fine for the basic things people were using it for at the time. destinyhud they both sucked at that time but android sucked more than iOS at that time. SVem26 I like to think I am in the nerd userbase and I don't care what kernel is used.. can you help me understand why it matters? UnlikeABoss Do you want a brand new obscure kernel in thing that holds most of your sensitive details? TipTop I don't want something that dates back to 90s, is full of zero-days and horrible code contributed by nobodies. UnlikeABoss The idea that it is full of zero days is hilarious. You do realize that the majority of Linux exploits are local, right? Unlike Windows. Yes there is obviously code from the 90s, but very, very little of it. Not to mention that age is not a factor in deciding bad code. The idea that old code is bad code shows your inexperience. By that standard, should we dismiss Chrome because of all the exploits being found in code that was written when it first started? Are we going to create brand new software every few years to purge "old code"? Do you have any idea whatsoever how much Linux has actually changed? Do you have any idea how much of this change is because it's considered a "universal" kernel everyone can use and is focusing on? Do you really think splitting the community over onto another kernel will increase security for either of those kernels? There's a little something called code maturity. There's a reason Microsoft has way less exploits in its kernel today than 10 years ago. They didn't write a new kernel from scratch. Sir_Brizz All OSes are full of vulnerabilities and horrible code written by nobodies. If that is your requirement then you must have gone full luddite by now. ihsan ışık Are you implying that Android got popular because of "nerds" who heard it uses the Linux kernel? UnlikeABoss If you are old enough to know the early days of android you'll know that having every single nerd on the internet promoting Android over iOS most certainly helped get the ball rolling. Once it was pushed, it snowballed into what it is today. m477 Sure. It was the nerds on the internet, not the manufacturers with ads everywhere. Most people still don't know their Galaxy runs Android. UnlikeABoss The giant billboards came YEARS afterwards, cmon. m477 Yes, and that's why Android was so unpopular in the early days. UnlikeABoss What? It was massively popular among all techies for being the open source iOS alternative. m477 You are overestimating the "techies" crowd. Even BlackBerryOS was more popular at the time. Only after the Galaxy S it started to grow, and became popular among normal people. UnlikeABoss Not really. We are talking over a decade ago now, there were far less people on the internet and it was far easier for techies to promote products because everyone was asking their "techie" friend what is best. But these days everyone is an "expert" so that's not as much of a thing. m477 Again, you overestimate how many techies there actually were. Your personal experience is anecdotal. Market shares and sell data are objective. Also, over a decade ago Android was still a camera os, and it wasn't public. UnlikeABoss No, I do not. The further back in time you go, the higher the proportion of techies there were using the internet versus others. People were only just starting to look at buying a smartphone, and asking techies what they should buy. m477 Yes, the concentration on the internet of "techies" on the internet was greater. And? What normal user at the time went to the internet, looked at reviews and said "Oh, look! The HTC magic has Linux! This random guy says its good, so I'm gonna buy it!"? You really think that a bunch of "techies">marketing? A guy saying that his toy-looking HTC G1 is better than the iPhone is more effective than billboards and tv ads? Come on, even Windows Mobile was more popular. It took Samsung's aggressive marketing to make Android popular. UnlikeABoss Windows Mobile and BlackBerry were more popular in the enterprise, that's it. The entire discussion is home users. Also I think there's been some confusion. I wasn't implying that techies on the internet were promoting Android on the internet like a marketing department. I was implying that the internet was very much a "social media" platform for techies to communicate where the majority of them would use Android and mocked the use of iOS. The actual "marketing" happened offline when a normal user would ask their "techie" friend for first time buying advice. It is nothing like that today, and the internet is nothing like the techie community it once was. m477 So, what you're saying is that the internet was a circlejerk of Android users. Ok, and? It didn't affected normal users the slightest, iOS was still more popular until Samsung took Android more seriously. The techie friend thing its only your anecdotal experience, it bears no influence on the market, in the grand scheme of things. I'd even argue that Google's very light marketing did much, much more. Also, the mindless techies that recommended half backed devices instead of better alternatives because "Uh, Linux!!" did more harm than good, both to the users and to Android. UnlikeABoss If you read my OP you'll see my original point was that Google has rode the "Android circlejerk" to popularity, and you can debate how much popularity that added as much as you want. The fact remains, it got the ball rolling. Samsung didn't pick it up "just because", it saw that a lot of people were pushing it. There were several OS at the time it could have used, including sticking to its own. Why bother with Android? Maybe because it wanted to see how much market it could take by appealing to techies? However, if you stand back and look at it, how is this any different from "embrace, extend, extinguish"? Google used that "free marketing" and has now decided to use it's massive popularity to push a different product. (Which has failed in the past and will hopefully fail again). Why hate Microsoft for doing that in the past, but we praise Google for doing it? Why are we excited for something we know nothing about that is creating fragmentation? m477 Samsung had used several OSes, it had Windows Mobile and Phone devices, Symbian devices, and proprietary devices, even Palm OS devices IIRC. They used them all. Android had was the easiest to personalise for them, and create a copy of the best selling product, which was the iPhone, and there was an app market, so they tried to release and market their flagship with it, and market it as broadly as Apple. The first Galaxy (the "non S") was was vastly ignored, because it was as little marketed as all their other devices. The techies crowd was insignificant. The free marketing is just as much as Windows 10 gets for incorporating Ubuntu's bash terminal. What you saw is not really important. I saw lots and lots of Windows Phones in 2010 and 11. Many more than Android devices. Every one I knew had one, and if I had to say which OS was the most popular only based on my personal experience, in my smallish city, I'd obviously would say Windows Phone. Why are you so attached to Linux, excluding all possibilities of giving a possibly better solution a try? The community will just fork the AOSP and continue the development of the Linux branch. UnlikeABoss Cmon, we both know Android was not easier for them to customize than simply using their own OS. No one was recommending it, techie or not, no matter how much they marketed. It's only now they are popular they are trying to slip in their own OS, and still failing. I am not attached to Linux despite people using it as an easy scapegoat to dismiss a discussion critiquing almighty Google. We currently have a situation where most kernel developers focus entirely on Linux, making it virtually the universal kernel. Why are we creating pointless fragmentation there? Why divide that community? Do we honestly believe that a divided community can produce a better kernel, or do we love it because Google is doing it? Would we love it if Microsoft did this? m477 The proprietary OS they used at the time was a Java based thing with a flash interface. Hardly able to compete against iOS. It was easier for them to use the "next Symbian" that they could customise as they wanted, and that also had an app market. If they made, say, Bada, before Android become established and popular, and marketed it as much as they did with their Galaxy S, the market would be very different today. The normal user doesn't care what OS their shiny phone runs, as long as there's facebook. I am a GNU/Linux user since the first half of the 2000s, and I've always critiqued Google for using Linux as a kernel on phones. Linux might be the universal kernel, but smartphones need a more streamlined solution. I don't care if it's Google, the MIT, or Richard Stallman in person to do it. I liked WP8 architecture. Fragmentation is not pointless if it brings benefits to the user. TipTop Nobody cares about your FSF agenda. John Q I think the chief reason Google is not using Linux is that they want a real-time OS (RTOS). Linux is at best a "soft" RTOS, possessing a real-time scheduler but this is still not nearly as real-time as an actual RTOS should be. It would take a very large effort to do that for Linux so it makes sense that Google would want to make their own kernel that they can have full control over. UnlikeABoss Let's ignore the fact that Linux is used in real time car systems for a moment. Could you elaborate on why you think Google would want/need a RTOS on their smartphones? M6 The kernel they're using, 'magenta', is opened source. So who cares if they're using linux or not? Does everyone have to use linux? UnlikeABoss No it doesn't have to be Linux. But who else will use Magenta? Probably no one. So why are we fragmenting the kernel space further? Why would you choose an immature kernel for something as valuable (your data) as your smartphone. Would you trust that? I would much rather developers continue focusing on a single kernel. WesleySmalls But wouldn't Magenta be this single kernel? UnlikeABoss If everyone decided to ditch Linux and focus purely on Magenta as the universal kernel, yes. Will that happen? WesleySmalls Could be, just not overnight. The market was already fairly well developed when Linux arrived in 1991, yet it still managed to become a very, if not the most, important player in the market. It's certainly possible, it will just require proper investment(and neglect of their alternate platforms) and patience to make it work M6 That's some straight up communist shit right there. Let's just work on one thing, because we only need one thing, everything else is redundant! Let's not allow other people to do the same thing in a different way, because competition totally doesn't spur innovation at all. WORPspeed So Andromeda definitely dead or still happening? sleepinlight Pretty sure this IS Andromeda, or at least a part of it. Andromeda was never an official name for anything, it was just the internal project name for some sort of new and/or merged OS. WORPspeed I thought Andromeda specifically referred to merging Android and Chrome OS. So is that specific merger dead or on life-support? John Q Nah, the Android/Chrome merger was just speculation from what Andromeda seemed to be. There was never any concrete evidence to imply that Andromeda was a merger. WORPspeed To quote Androidpolice : "So please, when you see Fuchsia mentioned, or speculation that it "is" Andromeda, know that it is just that: speculation. Last we heard from sources we consider extremely reliable, Android was the basis of Andromeda, and Andromeda would see its commercial debut on a new Pixel laptop later this year. It is possible Google has changed plans around Andromeda, that the initiative itself may have even been scrapped. Though, we have no reason to think so - it's more that we don't know, and haven't heard anything about Andromeda in quite some time." http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/02/15/speculation-around-googles-fuchsia-os-and-andromeda-is-creating-confusion-and-misinformation/ WORPspeed http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/02/15/speculation-around-googles-fuchsia-os-and-andromeda-is-creating-confusion-and-misinformation/ That makes them seem very separate Srujan https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/e7fda716dfcfdca76e200e51a9c9144c72e183c7e76d36b910c20ee0931aee79.gif destinyhud if this replaces android rather than having 2 separate codebase, I am all up for it. splitting the android community is dangerous senor_heisenberg Well if this does end up being what replaces Android or what Android evolves into, I just hope my apps and whatnot are compatible. Ain't got the time or money to be investing into another ecosystem. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman That's a tricky, double-edged sword. I can't fathom they would not support the old apps, or at least the vast majority of them, for exactly that reason. But in doing so it will likely be held back at least slightly from what it can/should be. Backward-compatibility tends to hold everything back. What I'd wager is we won't see this until hardware's powerful enough to make emulating the old system in a VM relatively cheap and easy, with back-end Play Store penalties to developers who don't shift to the new app models, and then slow phase-outs in stages of the older functionality and support until the new OS is running exclusively its own setup. senor_heisenberg That sounds good. Randy Gindy I think Google porting the Android Run-time to Chrome OS was to see if they could do it. morteum This is old news, I'm waiting for Fuchsia 2.0 Barracuda. /s marcusmarcus2 What if they aren't going by Animal names in general but by mammal names.

Suicide_Note There is no update problem. Nexus/Pixels run the latest and greatest. OEMs who mess with the OS give their customers severely delayed updates. pfmiller Nexus and Pixels run the latest and greatest for two years. Nobody would accept this OS update situation if it was on a desktop OS. MJ Thank God it's phones we are talking about and not a desktop PC. marcusmarcus2 That is exactly why Windows XP lasted only a couple years before all computers updated to Windows 7... Seriously though. I'm fine with only getting Android version upgrades phones for 2 years. But they really need to extend out security updates beyond 3 years. Suicide_Note This isn't a desktop OS, not to mention people tend to change phones much more often than their desktops. pfmiller Sure it's not a desktop OS, but no sense pretending that what we have leaves nothing to be desired. And sure people change their phones more often that their desktops, but there's absolutely no reason to change every 2 years. Doby Gillis Which is a problem, Einstein. Suicide_Note Not if you're a Nexus/Pixel owner, Dilbert. Randy Gindy I would generally say there is. Android phones are not supported for nearly as long as an iPhone. The reason being that the chip set manufacturers do not release new drivers. Shelly-Man Vol 2 It's looks pretty neat for a development stage. Rami Well Android has to reach Z someday. In the case, Hello Fuchsia! marcusmarcus2 Those split-screens will be really useful for running of of Google's different messaging apps. Hopefully OS's aren't the new messaging apps of Google.

Neither, this is just a side project many developers use to test and work out the feasability of a variety of things. Android is a very well developed environment, and replacing it whole is simply a no-go. Things will just gradually evolve, as they have already done with Dalvik being replaced by ART, for example. Sir_Brizz I don't think you're wrong, but it would be in Google's best interest to start building a non-JVM runtime that apps can run inside with a native language that Google has 100% full control over like Go or Dart.

PVL_93_RU Those "stories" on the "home screen" look like they'd fit perfectly for a kiosk-type display, where you have a lot of space to work with JG Fuchsia is a purple-y pink color. T-Mobile's color is Magenta, a slightly different purple-y pink color T-Mobile is rumored to be looking into launching their own phone... Coincidence??? Almost certainly, without a doubt yes... But consider... T-Mobile also launched the first Android phone... yoloswag Inspired by the messaging team, Google wants to start working on a 2nd operating system. JG Magenta is designed for "modern phones and modern personal computers with fast processors, non-trivial amounts of ram with arbitrary peripherals doing open ended computation." Modern personal computers huh? I've been interested in Google packing ChromeOS into a LiveCD type set up we could test/install on our own computers... (*Yes, I know of Chromium, haven't tried it yet... But I would prefer it coming direct from Google, faster updates and all that). It could be interesting to try out another of Google's OSs without having to fork over several hundred for new hardware... The only problem would be drivers to support the various hardware. If not modified too much, ChromeOS could possibly use the original Gentoo Linux drivers. But with Fuchsia using its own unique kernel... That might throw things off a bit... I know a few less tech-savey individuals who would probably be more comfortable if the same OS powered their phone, tablet and desktop (should Google opt to replace Android with Fuchsia). Especially if it could run both Android apps and Chrome extensions natively. Zxyon Rhysivz This could be the beginning of distros for Android. *Imagines Ubuntu Android* Peter World Citizen This will run in parallel with Android.

The new Google Maps location sharing can share your location via links Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/03/28 2:48pm PDTMar 28, 2017 52 Plus 1 on G+ 96 Share on Facebook 71 Share on Twitter Total Shares219 Applications Google News Google started rolling out the new location sharing feature in Google Maps today, which is vastly more streamlined than the old method. You can share your location with a contact, of course, but there's more to it. You can also create links that share your location, and they come with all the same controls as contact sharing. To create a link, simply set the length of time you want your location shared and pick an app. Choosing a contact simply connects directly to their account, but using the "More" button at the bottom (or the shortcut next to it) creates a link. They're all "maps.app.goo.gl" URLs. You can do whatever you want with the link—email it, share it in a message, even tweet it. I don't know why you would do that, but you can. The links are managed just like connections to contacts. You can deactivate them at any time and view the current status in Maps. Each one is also unique, so you can set different lengths of time for different links. It's a bit similar to the photo sharing links built into Google Photos. Neat, right?

It is now enabled for me. In the UK. The app never updated. Artem Russakovskii Yeah, it's a server side change. Total Insecurity I think you can force it, though. Here in Germany in German language I got it by doing the following: "[On my other phone] it could get activated by signing out and in again. Then you need to press the new widget and it should appear. Maybe try deleting a your cache like I did before as well! All you need to do is: Go to widgets in Android, add and click on the share location widget​." Dirge LOL. No need to jump through hoops. Just clear google map's cache and force stop, then open it again and viola! It is there. Total Insecurity Not everyone made that experience, I think. But you could be right, though. :) Ian Kumlien If you select settings from the three buttons on the right side, you can select which circles to share with but the settings can't be saved apparently demarcmj That is probably a remnant from G+. When I first went to that settings page yesterday, it complained at me that I needed a G+ profile. But today that went away and it's working. I imagine that circle sharing will probably go away entirely. Shaques So if you're sharing via a contact and not a link, that person needs to have Google Maps installed on their device (mainly thinking iOS) for it to work properly otherwise they apparently receive an email. Midas Gordon-Farleigh I think they'll need to be logged into their Google account too, obviously. I have many contacts that I can invite that definitely use Google maps, but haven't logged in - more particularly on iOS where it's not linked to the OS. Morten Ulv Just tested, no need to be logged in. JG Does it work on the web as well? If so iOS (and the few WP users) could access your location via maps.google.com via their web browser of choice without having to install Google Maps app... bulletmark Location sharing in the G+ app was poorly implemented and the web view was hopeless. This new native implementation in Maps seems to work great though, both on mobile and the web. F4LL0U7 Yeah even Latitude wasn't implemented so well. Let's hope this is something they stick with, and don't abandon it like they tend to do. demarcmj Agree, but Latitude was at least implemented better than G+ Rod Just got it. (Brazil) http://i.imgur.com/T13JaqD.png Carson Saldanha Before us US folks? Unacceptable! /s Rod Haters gonna hate. Dirge I'm in the US and I got it around Noon, Pacific Time. René Simonsen Would like to know how it works on the receiving end. Is that part integrated into Google Maps too? Can I share my location with an iOS user, and will he easily keep track of my location in his Google Maps app? ericshmerick iOS works as well, appeared on my iPhone a few hours ago. Should be platform independent as it's using Google's services/account to communicate. Giampi Working very well. I would like a persistent notification when sharing although. F4LL0U7 The option to have it would be good. They have that in Trusted Contacts. But for those of us who share indefinitely with a spouse, that would get annoying, so it would be good to be able to turn it off. Jennifercalvarez Google is paying 97$ per hour!

Jurij Turnšek Can you comment on battery drain when sharing location constantly? F4LL0U7 My wife and I have been sharing our locations with each other constantly since the feature launched, and we haven't noticed any impact on battery life. I don't think it's using any more power than usual. Your phone determines your exact location on a pretty regular basis anyway, assuming you have that enabled. All this feature is doing is taking that info that Google already knows, and sharing it with people of your choice. tofuuu630 After a month in, can you comment on the battery life? I tried it for a day but noticing my battery dropped faster than normal. But then again I'm not sure if it was placebo effect or due to the app's I downloaded around that time. Thanks! F4LL0U7 No noticeable difference in battery life whatsoever. I'm still at 20-30% by end of day. See my comment above. It's not using any extra resources, unless you didn't have location services always enabled anyway. tofuuu630 Thanks for the fast response! Yeah I figured it shouldn't use more battery since google now always knows where you are near as long as you have location services set to high accuracy (which I do) so maybe it's placebo effect that I'm experiencing. Will test it for a longer period and see! Benjamin Pavel When this activated they also turned off the G+ location sharing...that sucks as I've had my mother and my cousin on there and it seems these shared locations are not transitioning to this new system which sucks! Biff Wonsley Yeah, you're gonna have to set them up again from scratch. Oddly, my G+ location sharing widget is still working, even though location sharing in my Maps is live. I know where my wife is, she doesn't know where I am. Even though she's sitting right next to me. F4LL0U7 Sharing via a link is a great idea. Does your location have a persistent link? Like, could my wife and I bookmark each other's locations on our desktops? Or would we have to share to a link and bookmark that? codemonkey85 If it's your wife, why even deal with links if you can share directly through Google accounts? But anyway, the links you generate are persistent, same as Photos sharing links... until they are revoked. F4LL0U7 We are sharing that way, I'm just wondering if there's a permalink directly to the user's location, (if someone is sharing with you) for bookmarking purposes. demarcmj I think I saw something in the video they put out that said sharing via link was limited to a certain duration. Can't be set as "ongoing." JG They're all "maps.app.goo.gl" URLs. You can do whatever you want with the link—email it, share it in a message, even tweet it. I don't know why you would do that, but you can. A food truck might want to tweet a link to their location so fans could come get food... create812 I can imagine some people will come up with clever and creative uses of this feature. mwolverine If my wife and I share location with each other (until we turn it off), will this be a massive battery drain? Rod Yes. GPS + location download/upload Jeroen Kap My guess: no. Your smartphone updates your location by default on standard times. I think this will benefit from that information. Only when you force a refresh in Maps it will gain new location data Rod Sure about that? Because then, it won't be exactly "live" tracking.. KappadeX That (actual battery and GPS use) will be the case when you navigate. And send the ETA link to a friend. I was assuming you meant the daily location sharing. The Pool Man I have this exact question too. demarcmj No more than usual. Your phone doesn't check location any more or less than it normally would. It just shares whatever your most recent location was. The only additional battery implications are the sharing part of it, but that's not a lot of data to transfer. Tomáš Petrík I hope they will add a feature to turn on/off the layer with the contact heads on the map, just like I can turn on/off traffic, satellite, etc. Sure, when I want to check where somebody is, I will enable that and look. But I don't want the icons in the map permanently (from family members who share the location indefinitely). demarcmj Yea that'd be nice. When it was Latitude, they had it implemented as a layer, like satellite or traffic, so it could do just that. HSidhu The sad part is that you have to turn on location history. groid Is location history required to be able to use this? I know you are asked to turn it on when setting up the sharing, but does it have to stay on? I really don't want to keep location history on and I have no use for timeline or any other location history feature. HSidhu I think it should be ON all the time but you should try turning it OFF and see if it still tells you your friend's location. let us know too. Matt Terk My Maps app crashes every time I try to enable Location Sharing, either by link or through the menu. Anyone else experienced this? Wiped cache/davlik, on PureNexus 7.1.1 Shamu, I am in the beta for Maps.

Including speed and location history, it even shows the path they took. It also shows if the person in moving or not. Google might introduce all this in coming days. SSyar i still dont get the sharing option :/ johnforamerica Suddenly it doesn't work on my wife's iphone, and she's not getting a timeline history for the last 3 days either.

Digital Trends Home > Mobile > Google Chrome for Android gets better at saving… Google Chrome for Android gets better at saving offline content for later viewing By Christian de Looper — Updated May 8, 2017 7:05 pm Subscribe Share Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you Regularly find yourself in patchy reception? Google Chrome for Android just got better at saving web pages, music, and videos. Google wants to make it a little easier to access content, even when you don’t have an internet connection. The company is launching a few tweaks and changes to its Downloads feature in the latest version of Chrome for Android. Downloads launched in Chrome for Android in December and it basically allowed users to save things like web pages, music, and even videos for viewing at a later date. At launch, to download a web page you would have had to open up the Chrome menu in the top-right of the browser, then hit the “Save” button. Then, hit the “Downloads” button to see all of your saved content. Now, however, you can simply long press a link, and you’ll see the option to “Download Link.” On top of that, the Chrome offline page has been given a new button to “Download Page Later” and if you press that, Chrome will download the page when you get connected to the internet. “Now you’ll always have a ready-to-go list of pages or articles to read even if you are out of data for the month or lose the network in a dead zone. Update to the latest version of Chrome and tap the download icon on any page to get started,” Google said in a blog post. The New Tab page has also been tweaked a little — now it’ll include articles that you previously downloaded, and you’ll be able to tell that they’re downloaded thanks to a special offline badge. The new feature does help put the browser on-par with other apps and services like Pocket, which allow users to save online content for offline viewing. Because the feature is built into Chrome, however, it could see much wider adoption and it could signal the beginning of the end for third-party services.
Digital Trends Home > Computing > Google’s Project Zero finds Windows… Google’s Project Zero finds Windows vulnerability, calls it “crazy bad” By Mark Coppock — Updated May 8, 2017 1:15 pm Subscribe Share Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you Google's Project Zero just discovered a Windows vulnerability, which highlights the importance of making sure you keep your Windows PC up to date. Judging by the number of exploits that have surfaced over the last several months, one might be tempted to think that the internet and PCs are generally unprotected and wide open for attack. Whether or not that is actually true, a significant number of highly visible and scary-sounding vulnerabilities have been documented lately. The latest comes from Google’s Project Zero, which locates flaws in systems like Microsoft Windows and promises to publicize them no later than 90 days after notifying the developer. That team has been true to its word, publishing exploits before they’ve actually been patched, and it has discovered one that it claims is the “worst … in recent memory,” as The The Hacker News reports. The news came via Project Zero member Tavis Ormandy’s tweet the other day: I think @natashenka and I just discovered the worst Windows remote code exec in recent memory. This is crazy bad. Report on the way. ???????????? &mdash; Tavis Ormandy (@taviso) May 6, 2017 In a subsequent tweet, Ormandy provided a few more details about the vulnerability: .@natashenka Attack works against a default install, don&#39;t need to be on the same LAN, and it&#39;s wormable. ???? &mdash; Tavis Ormandy (@taviso) May 6, 2017 Project Zero won’t reveal any additional details about the flaw, because of its own 90-day disclosure deadline. Presumably, Project Zero has passed the information along to Microsoft, which is hopefully in the process of determining how best to fix the exploit. While Microsoft may not be able to provide a fix in this month’s Patch Tuesday security update scheduled for May 9, it would still have at least one more Patch Tuesday to issue a fix before Project Zero makes the vulnerability public. Microsoft has been a Project Zero target in the past, including some instances where a vulnerability was publicized before Microsoft issued a patch. The Google team has therefore been a target of some general angst around its policies, even as it has likely succeeded in prodding developers to move expeditiously in fixing flaws in their code. Natalie Silvanovich, another Project Zero member, responded to just these sorts of concerns with a tweet of her own: If a tweet is causing panic or confusion in your organization, the problem isn&#39;t the tweet, the problem is your organization &mdash; Natalie Silvanovich (@natashenka) May 6, 2017 This particular vulnerability serves as a reminder to make sure to keep your PCs updated with the latest security patches, and to ensure that your malware software is also up to date. While this vulnerability affects Windows, Apple’s MacOS users are not immune to attack and should take their own precautions as well.

However back then Fuchsia existed as a mere command line, but it looks like things have progressed rather nicely because thanks to a report from ArsTechnica, screenshots of the OS have since emerged. Now we’re not sure what Google has planned for Fuchsia but if there’s one thing that should be noted it is that unlike Android or Chrome OS, Fuchsia is not based on Linux. Instead it appears to be based on Google’s own microkernel called Magenta. It might seem like a shock that Google could be ditching Linux, but as ArsTechnica points out, the Google Pixel is still using the Linux Kernel 3.18 which was released in 2014. For the most part and from the layman’s perspective, you’d be hardpressed to tell what the differences are between Fuchsia and Android, save for the UI which could just as be easily skinned. However whatever Google has planned for Fuchsia, it seems that this is more than just an experiment. This is according to Fuchsia developer Travis Geiselbrecht told the IRC chat room that the Fuchsia OS “isn’t a toy thing, it’s not a 20% project, it’s not a dumping ground of a dead thing that we don’t care about anymore.” In any case we suppose it might be a while before we hear anything more, but until then what do you guys think Google has planned for the OS?

Last year, Samsung released an Android 7.0 Nougat beta for select Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge owners. It gave users a chance to try the software and its features ahead of the official release date. It also gave testers a chance to report bugs. Samsung’s Galaxy Nougat beta wiped out some issues, Android Nougat problems have slipped through the cracks into the final Android Nougat releases for Samsung Galaxy S7, Galaxy S6, and the Galaxy Note 5. There are also problems plaguing the version of Nougat powering the new Samsung Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+. Earlier this year, Samsung started rolling out its Android Nougat update. The release started with the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge but now it’s hitting the Galaxy S6, Galaxy S6 Edge, the Galaxy Note 5, and the Galaxy Tab S2. It will expand to more devices later this year. Samsung’s version of Android Nougat brings some outstanding changes to the UI, to the popular Multi-Window mode, and more. It’s an exciting update for Galaxy users. While many Galaxy users are doing just fine on Android Nougat, others are struggling with some frustrating issues. With that in mind, we want to take a broad look at the Android Nougat issues affecting Samsung’s Galaxy devices. This roundup includes a look at the current climate, some resources for those running into trouble, and a look at what’s next from Google and Samsung. How to Prepare for Android Nougat The first thing you need to know about Samsung Galaxy Android Nougat problems is that they’re unpredictable. While many Galaxy smartphone and tablet users will emerge from the installation process without any major headaches, others will encounter small bugs and major issues with the new operating system. This is why we recommend doing some prep work before you install Nougat. A little preparation can go a long way toward preventing issues. To help you, we’ve put together a game plan that will take you some of the steps to take before installing Android Nougat on your Galaxy device. You don’t need to take every single step but at the very least you’ll want to make sure you’ve backed up all of your important files. If you’re new to Android or you simply want to cover all of your bases, take a look at our walkthrough. It could help you prevent Android Nougat problems. You should also take a look at a few things we recommend after you install Android Nougat on your Galaxy S7, Galaxy S6, or Galaxy Note 5.  You might find something useful there as well. Samsung Galaxy Nougat Problems As the Nougat roll out picks up speed we’re starting to hear more about the Nougat issues plaguing the Galaxy S7, Galaxy S7 Edge, Galaxy S6, Galaxy S6 Edge, Galaxy Note 5, and Galaxy Tab. Samsung Galaxy S8 Nougat Problems The Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ are finally here. The two devices are two of the best smartphones ever made but they’re far from perfect. Owners of Samsung’s new Galaxy S8 are complaining about a wide range of problems ranging from poor battery life to issues with the fingerprint sensor to problems with GPS to annoying random reboot issues. These Galaxy S8 Nougat issues are similar to the other Android 7.0 problems plaguing older Galaxy smartphones and tablets. Look for Samsung and its carrier partners to roll out Android Nougat bug fix updates to address these early issues. We typically see the first batch of updates roll out a few weeks after launch. Samsung Galaxy S7 Nougat Problems Samsung Galaxy S7 owners are complaining about various Wi-Fi issues, issues with the camera, issues with sound/speakers, abnormal battery drain, Bluetooth issues, LED notification issues, lag, keyboard problems, installation issues, issues with SMS and calls, Theme Store issues, problems with WhatsApp, and various issues with Samsung Pass. Samsung’s also acknowledged issues with screen mirroring when using the Quick Connect feature. If screen mirroring is busted, you might need to download the Screen Mirroring patch from the Google Play Store. @SamsungMobileUS .. Galaxy s7 Edge.. Nougat update drains battery life twice as earlier. Please look into this.🙄 — pranay raj (@pranayraj09) February 27, 2017 @jspring86az Is it maybe Grace UX that's causing issues with Samsung's battery life? My S7 edge on the Nougat beta has AWFUL battery. — Angel AR (@angelartech) January 19, 2017 I'm loving the new android update 7.0 @Android but wow it drains my battery twice as fast @SamsungUK #s7edge 😕 — Michael Almond (@mickalmond) January 19, 2017 @SamsungMobileUK galaxy s7 nougat update bug report – bad battery drain. Android OS and Android System both using up to 30% in background. — pete (@lilopete) January 21, 2017 Pathetic WiFi Performance on Nougat Galaxy S7! Please fix! #samsung, #Nougat , #GalaxyS7. WiFi keeps.jumping between two of my Networks. — Sujoy Shivde (@FluidicJoy) February 21, 2017 Now that the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge Nougat updates are rolling out in the United States, we’re starting to see U.S. users complain about various Android 7.0 issues. T-Mobile Galaxy S7 users are complaining about installation problems, Wi-Fi problems, issues with battery life, a problem wherein apps are vanishing from the home screen, abnormal amounts of UI lag, voice issues, notification issues, and predictive text problems. Sprint Galaxy S7 Nougat users are complaining about issues with GPS strength, connection errors, and random reboots. On AT&T, Galaxy S7 users are experiencing issues with the fingerprint sensor, problems with Samsung Browser, GPS issues, and abnormal battery drain problems. Verizon Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge users aren’t immune to the problems plaguing Samsung’s flagships from 2016. We’re already seeing complaints about broken Wi-Fi, issues with notifications, weird battery drain, and lag. We expect the list of Nougat issues to grow as the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge Android Nougat updates hit more devices. Galaxy S6 Nougat Problems We’re also seeing a number of complaints about the Samsung Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 Edge Nougat updates. The battery life on my @SamsungMobileUS Galaxy S6 is garbage. Latest Nougat update makes it worse. — Jim (@IMFletcher2) April 28, 2017 1) @SamsungMobile @SamsungTurkiye New #Nougat update for #GalaxyS6 drain battery bloody fast! after 3 days of usage i noticed several issues — AntiFraudTeam (@AntiFraudTeam) March 13, 2017 @SamsungHelpUK Galaxy S6 forced Nougat download and update on me. Recharged battery next time and now phone totally dead. Seen this before? — simonsanders (@simonsanders) March 27, 2017 @IMFletcher2 @SamsungMobileUS Same…also been getting Enhanced Messaging popup crap… — art…. (@querido4975) April 28, 2017 @SamsungMobile The Galaxy S6 Nougat update is killing my battery ridiculously FAST!! Never had this issue before…Please fix/patch 😠😭 — Naomi Monique (@Eurydice_Guise) April 17, 2017 @SamsungMobile I am having issues with Bluetooth and making calls since the update to #android 7.0 on my Galaxy S6 Edge — Tariq (@t4riq) April 26, 2017 Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 Edge Nougat include bad battery life, problems with RAM management, lag and lockups, jagged animations, overheating, GPS issues, Bluetooth issues, and various installation issues. Sprint Galaxy S6 users are complaining about issues with charging, random reboots, and odd Wi-Fi problems. Verizon Galaxy S6 users are seeing Wi-Fi problems, problems with Amazon’s Kindle, slow app response time, and more. This is precisely why you should prepare your device for the Android 7.0 Nougat update. This is also why you should take your time with Nougat. Yes, it’s an exciting update but if you’re having a solid experience on Android Marshmallow (or something older like Lollipop), you’ll want to really dig into Nougat feedback before making your move. Galaxy Note 5 Nougat Problems The Samsung Galaxy Note 5 Nougat update is also rolling out in force and we’re also hearing about some of the issues plaguing Samsung’s big screen device. @SamsungSupport my Galaxy Note 5's battery is ruined after updating to 7.0. Isn't charging and won't stay on unless plugged in. Please help! — Daniel Gorman (@DanielG97431232) April 12, 2017 @SamsungMobileUS @SamsungMobile Plz fix asap fast charging issues on Galaxy Note 5 Nougat update. Also battery is draining like hell. — Amir Riyaz Khan (@Arkhan786) April 6, 2017 BATTERY NOT CHARGING IN FAST CHARGING n CABLE MODE AFTER NOUGAT 7.0 UPDATE ON MY GALAXY NOTE 5 INDIA, SERIOUS ISSUE SAMSUNG @SamsungMobileIN — Ankit Singh (@ankitsinghvns1) April 7, 2017 Galaxy Note 5 Nougat users are noticing installation problems, weird battery drain and connectivity issues including wonky Bluetooth. Others are running into issues with various first and third-party applications including Samsung Pay, random reboots, problems with the LED light and notifications, issues with GPS, missing widgets, and installation issues. The Samsung Galaxy Note 5 Nougat release is still pretty limited and we expect complaints to pickup as the update rolls out to more users. Galaxy Tab Nougat Problems Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 owners are also running into various problems with their version of Android 7.0 Nougat. Some Galaxy Tab S2 users are noticing Wi-Fi issues, slow charging problems, UI lag, Bluetooth problems, and issues with Google Play. Samsung’s Galaxy Tab Nougat update is still extremely limited and we expect Nougat problems to emerge on board the next batch of updates. Where to Find Feedback As we push away from the start of Samsung’s Android 7.0 Nougat roll out, current and future Nougat users need to keep an eye on feedback. If you own a Samsung Galaxy S8, Galaxy S8+, Galaxy S7, Galaxy S7 Edge, Galaxy S6, Galaxy S6 Edge, Galaxy Note 5, or another Galaxy device running Nougat, now would be a good time to start taking a look at feedback from those who are already on the Android 7.0 Nougat update. This feedback will alert you to potential Nougat problems as well as the potential benefits of installing the new operating system on your device. Ultimately, this feedback could help you decide if you want to install Nougat on day one or wait for Samsung/your carrier to roll out a bug fixer to address issues. We recently put together a list of reasons to, and not to, install the Samsung Galaxy S7 Android Nougat update. We recently gave the Galaxy S6 Nougat update, the Galaxy Note 5 Nougat update, and the Galaxy Tab Nougat update the same treatment. If you’re on the fence about Android Nougat, that’s a great place to start. We also recommend XDA-Developers and Android Central Forums. These are two excellent resources and they’re worth bookmarking. Once carriers start pushing out Android Nougat you’ll want to head to carrier-specific forums on XDA-Developers or the official forums at carriers like AT&T, Verizon and Sprint. We’ll see a ton of feedback emerge there. You should also use social media sites like Twitter to gather valuable feedback from your fellow Galaxy users. How to Fix Galaxy Android Nougat Problems If you do run into an Android Nougat update on your Galaxy device there’s no need to panic. There’s a good chance you’ll be able to fix your issue from the comfort of your chair. To start, you’ll want to take a look at our list of fixes for the most common Samsung Galaxy Nougat problems. Our list includes fixes for abnormal battery life, Wi-Fi connectivity issues, bad Bluetooth, UI lag, and more. We’ve also put together some tips to improve Nougat performance on the Galaxy S7, Galaxy S6, Galaxy Note 5, and Galaxy Tab S2. If you can’t find your fix there, XDA-Developers, Twitter, Android-centric forums like Android Central, and carrier forums are also great resources. If you were having an excellent experience on Marshmallow you can also flash back to the older version of Android if you think that will improve your device’s performance. What’s Next If you can’t find a fix for your Galaxy Android Nougat problem know that you’ll probably be on your own for long stretches. We expect Samsung and its carrier partners to push out bug fixes to address Nougat issues but these updates can, and probably will, be sporadic. The good news is that Samsung’s already rolling out stability patches to the Galaxy S8, Galaxy S8+, Galaxy S7, and Galaxy S7 Edge. The Galaxy S7 patches are tiny, less than 100MB, but they include bug fixes and performance enhancements. The Samsung Galaxy S8 patch comes with a remedy for the red tint issue. The company is also planning to roll out an update to address Wi-Fi issues. Samsung will also continue to roll out monthly security updates to its Galaxy devices though there’s no guarantee they will have bug fixes on board. The May security update doesn’t appear to have any bug fixes on board. It’s also worth noting that Samsung’s version of Android Nougat update is based on Android 7.0, not Android 7.1.1 Nougat or Android 7.1.2. Android 7.1.2 is now the most up-to-date version of Android Nougat. It’s unclear if Samsung plans to deploy Android 7.1.1 or Android 7.1.2 to its Galaxy smartphones and tablets though there are some signs of life. A recent Samsung Nougat benchmark shows Android 7.1.1 on board a Galaxy A3. More recent benchmarks show the update being tested on the Galaxy S7.  These are both good signs but benchmarks can be faked.   Google’s Android 7.1.2 update is “an incremental maintenance release focused on refinements, so it includes a number of bug fixes and optimizations, along with a small number of enhancements for carriers and users.” It could prove useful to Galaxy S8, Galaxy S7, Galaxy S7 Edge, Galaxy S6, Galaxy S6 Edge, and Galaxy Note 5 users struggling on Nougat. For more on Android 7.1.1 Nougat and Android 7.1.2 Nougat, take a look at our walkthrough. It’ll get you caught up with the latest software updates from Google. And if you are dealing with issues, keep those fingers crossed. Fixes from Google/Samsung/your carrier could be coming soon. 3 Reasons Not to Install Galaxy S7 Nougat & 8 Reasons You Should Install Nougat If You Want Better Security   1 / 11 Let's start with some basics. If you value your security, and most of you probably do, you'll want to think about installing the Galaxy S7 Nougat update soon after it arrives for your device.  Every month, Google and Samsung release important security patches for Android devices. The Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Android Nougat updates should bring the latest security patches to your device. Samsung's initial batch of Galaxy S7 Nougat updates delivered the company's January security update while upcoming updates could deliver the patches from the February security update. You can read more about their contents on Samsung's website.  If you failed to download or receive an older security update (December, November, etc), the patches from those updates might be baked into your version of Nougat. If not, you might be forced to install them manually before you can download Nougat.  On top of the patches, Samsung's Galaxy S7 Nougat update brings Samsung Pass, a way to secure your identity using biometric data rather than entering your password or ID.  Samsung Pass is like a master key for your various logins and it relies on Galaxy S7's fingerprint scanner. The biometric data is encrypted and stored safely by Samsung Knox.   1 / 11 53 Responses 02/14/2017 Tanvir Ahmed Reply After updating Nougat, i am facing severe problems of network error. It shows my cellular network is working but i am not able to make any calls or use data. Look forward for an update. 02/20/2017 Steve Reply I had nougat for one week and I don’t like it. Battery life was about the same. But white colour on notification bar, too small words in keyboard and some more thinks what looks really bad. So I downgraded back to 6.0.1 and it’s just what I like. Why they still trying make new Android ? Just improve battery life on devices. That’s what we need. No new androids……. 02/28/2017 Mohamed Reply How did u downgraded to software 6 04/20/2017 Steve Reply Just download firmware from sammobile.com and flash it via Odin. Sometime is good make factory reset before flashing. 03/14/2017 Annoyed user Reply How did you downgrade? I’ve been told that it was not possible. I have been unable to find a factory image for my particular (Verizon) model. The changes to the calendar and phone app UI is unacceptable to me. They make the apps harder to use. I have already encountered several (minor but annoying) errors, and the battery life seems to have gotten worse. 02/23/2017 KAUSHIK S GADHAI Reply since I updated, my play store will not work with mobile data and will download or update only with WiFi. tried all the remedies available on the net right from clearing cache to disabling and enabling google account and checking the restrictions of data but nothing seems to work. On my assistant of Live Chat simply the guy told me that its a nougat problem and he cant do anything about it ??!!! huh… also my call forwarding is not working even though i checked with service provider vodafone and there is no issue with vodafone. I am using Samsung S7 edge and seriously feel pathetic about this now. 02/24/2017 Jon M. Reply Came to look for any possible issues with nougat and gps. Started reading the story. Kept reading the same comments over and over, paragraph after paragraph that could be summed up by saying “s7 nougat update is being released, people are having problems.” and “Prep your device”. Literally, this reads like a middle school student trying to make that minimum word essay by using a whole bunch of paragraph fillers! This article is nothing but clickbait garbage. Thanks for wasting my time! 02/27/2017 Stan Reply I hate this update, I saw in the article that I can “flash back”. Any instructions on how to do this? 02/27/2017 f Reply I had the same issue as everyone. Playing around with the settings back and forth, I finally found the battery drain problem. Turn off video enhancer, and the app power monitor setting in advanced settings. Battery life is back to normal. Have been with the phone since 8am and now its 6pm and Im at 76% battery life. 03/02/2017 Nikola Reply Hi mate where is that app “power monitoring setting ” I can not find to switch off , I have Galaxy s7 edge and now I got problem a lot of drain battery 02/28/2017 Philipeason Reply Ive got loads of problems calls cutting off incoming call sounds muted stuff disapearing off home screen rang samsung theu said do a factory reset so i did started working again 5 days later same again no incoming call sounds alarm muted propper frustrated as i have 2 ill childred with cystic firosis and my dad at home on oxygen what happens if his machine goes off and my calls are muted . Iam using my samsung watch now to rely on hearing incomin calls not happy will be back on the phone to samsung tomorrow as i dont pay £600 for a phone for it not to work grrrrr 02/28/2017 Meir Cohen Reply My s7 edge nougat Exynos is very good. Battery life is even better and no any issues with wi fi or what so ever. Very good update. 03/02/2017 Teesmommy Reply My S7 edge is working good except for the low call volume. No one can hear me and I have to speak loudly when on calls 03/02/2017 Bob Y Reply After reading some of these articles & comments I was terrified to install the Nougat update but decided to take a chance & Installed it on my (Sprint) S7 Edge three days ago. I’ve had absolutely no problems at all. The phone seems a little faster & maybe a bit smoother & haven’t noticed any changes in battery life. I’ve used Android phones since the HTC Evo & think this update is one of the best I’ve gotten. This may be the first that hasn’t messed my phone up one way or another & one of few that really made the phone better. Not wild about the color change in list of conversations (hard to read) for texting but other than that I’m liking this phone more than ever after the update. 03/04/2017 Dee Reply After update I could not hear incoming callers… very muted. AT&T tried to troubleshoot. Did factory reinstall. Did not help. They’re sending me out a new phone. 03/07/2017 Wally Lopez Reply 18 years in the IT field witnessing software companies updating and changing GUIs. I find no reason for this Nougat update. Why fix what wasn’t broken? Now all your users have to adapt to get another method to get simple tasks done. Very sick of program writers trying to make a name for themselves while publishing a bad product. My phone is extremely slower and unresponsive most of the time. Android was supposed to be better than the typical change everything Mirosoft versions and now I see Android and Samsung has taken on this business idea. I highly doubt you have labs to test these be updates. I am very upset at the ungodly price I pay for your phones. This update had made me consider a new brand of phone. Horrible! 03/08/2017 Elizabeth Gonzalez Reply Since initiating the update I have had issues with everything from texting to Wi-Fi. Not only that but the issues are just getting worse.  Talk to text is impossible to use now and the update is not compatible with Spanish in the least. Wish there was a way to undo this. It is by far the worst update yet. I don’t even want to use my phone anymore. 03/11/2017 Shirley C Collins Reply My S7 edge when receiving, or making calls. I have to speak louder. I have dropped calls. I have issues with keypad. I need these issue fixed. Help 03/11/2017 pash timsina Reply Most annoying are abrupt fluctuations in sound volume. And : Keypad input response Facebook images appear tiny black screen freezes screen Hate it 03/16/2017 whsntme Reply If you have your phone is silent mode or vibrate, the LED will not flash for text messages. If you have your sound on, it will. Stupid, i know. 03/18/2017 Dan Reply Sprint s7 here, I’ve had every single issue above, regardless of carrier. Ready to dump this phone entirely. Phone was marvelous prior to update, now it’s broken. Everything is an issue. After this experience, I see why folks stick with IOS. Sure some updates have bugs, but this broken my phone. Wifi issues, keyboard is useless, call issues, major battery drain (half of what it used to be,) reboots, constant lag, glitches, lost functionality within the os and apps… and the best lart is no features to speak of. What, added security? Please, I only download from the playstore to avoid that. I’m calling Sprint tomorrow for help, as I’ve tried everything. Best of all is I updated while on vacation, when I need the phone most. 03/20/2017 gaurav dhir Reply s7 nougat update ….issue in screen mirroring share screen is hanging…is not smooth as previous and phone lags also previous update was fast….plz work on it 03/21/2017 Kahraman Reply What a shit update pls help me i want old version samsung s6 03/24/2017 Charley Reply Liked the ability to force a larger font to most applications (ie facebook…) although gmail is still “fine print” and the notification bars’ text is ridiculously tiny. Still can’t use camera and flashlight at the same time (WHY!?) and now the pocket mode quit working again – I’ll notice heat on my leg, pull phone out of my pocket, and find a dozen or more apps have been activated while in my pocket. That problem with the Galaxy S5 was the reason I jumped up to the S7. Now, I have to question whether they’re intentionally putting crap like that on the devices to coax users into spending the money on a new phone. Approximately one week since 7.0 pushed though, and now Verizon has another update, installing it as I type this message. Hopefully it’ll fix more than it breaks 03/26/2017 Samantha Reply My galaxy 7 edge screen shattered while charging terrible 03/31/2017 Mb Reply Day one observations s7 edge Verizon nougat update: 1.Fingerprint access no longer working 2. Audio playing from ear speaker and not normal media speaker at times 3. Internet connection having difficulties 4. Lag time all over. Not happy….i see potential when these pretty serious issues are resolved. 03/31/2017 Mun Reply I have installed Nougat 7 on my note 5 last night & I found that the battery drain very fast . Pls fix it asap . Tq. 03/31/2017 Mum Reply Note 5 after upgraded to nougat 7 battery won’t get 100 % even charged it whole night . 04/03/2017 Ron Reply Since Nougat updated, I’ve had icons and widgets moved, deleted. Also some websites with several pages just keep flying by-not stopping to read them. 04/04/2017 saad naeem Reply battery drain is bad for note 5 04/04/2017 Drey Reply For me I can’t load any videos, and on snapchat I can’t open any videos or send videos. The YouTube app does not work because none of the videos will load there either, phone battery drains quicker, and I could go on… but I appreciate the new emojis 04/04/2017 Felipe Reply The thing that solve my battery problem after installing Nougat on my S7, was restoring applications prefereces. In settings- >applications-> (three dots menu) -> Restore app preferences. (I also cleared the cache from the boot menu) (I did not make a factory reset before or after update) Before this the battery lasted 6 hours, and now more than 20. Hope this works for you two. 04/04/2017 Mary Reply Not a lot good about it….more steps just to find a contact. Got rid of favorites in contacts. Touch sensitivity seems worse. Lags in loading emails. Smaller tool bar. Thus far, the only thing I like is the blue light filter for the hour before you go to bed. If like to revert back unless they make an overhaul soon!! 04/06/2017 Tommy Reply update is a visual disaster! all this light pastel coloring is annoying and hard to see! phone is sluggish and im very disspointed with my brand new S7 Edge w Verizon, Google, Samsung and Verizon need to get on same page! 04/06/2017 Matt Reply I just updated my s7 edge this morning and now I’m getting Invalid SIM card error and no connectivity. Sprint chat tech did a reconnection that worked for 2 min before that failed with the same error too. 04/07/2017 Lindsey M Motter Reply My Samsung S7 suddenly has “forgotten” the pattern passcode I have been using for a LONG time .. I am now up to two remaining attempts to access the phone before it factory resets which I do NOT want it to do. Any insight would be appreciated! 04/12/2017 Chito Reply I am also experiencing ” apps forced stopped ” message on my Galaxy S7 edge after installing android 7.0 I did all available error correction re; wiping catched file, rebooting and factory reset etc… but it didn’t work any help? Im from philippines… 04/14/2017 alireza Reply hi do ” note edge ” activated (android 7) ?? best regards 04/14/2017 Sydney Reply I have the nougat update on my s6 and my only problems are the battery drain and completely mental keyboard. It’s literally frustrating to type on it or even us the swipe key function to type. I lost nearly 50% battery in 2 hours. 04/20/2017 Carolyn Flynn Reply My S7 edge worked great until last update. I rely heavy on my voice recognition to write emails and text. Found issues with it just repeating the same sentence over and over and other times deleting the whole text. The battery drain is a pain as it also means needing to have access to recharge multiple times during the day. I have placed an order for the upgraded S 8 plus and I can tell you now if it is anything like what I have been experiencing with the s7 edge upgrade software I will be highly disappointed as the voice recognition and commands is what I use the most. 04/21/2017 Tw Reply I have a S6 edge + and the fast charging feature is not working since the update. 04/24/2017 BreeAnna Reply My youtube doesnt work and when i make a call there is no ringing on my end of the phone so i hang up sometimes thinking the call didnt go thru because it is silent.. when i dont hang up and it goes thru i just hear silence until the person answers.. also noticing some lag going from app to app (not lag in chrome). 04/25/2017 Brad Daymond Reply I must be having a Nougat nightmare, and not the one where they left the nougats out of the Mars bar. Apps are crashing hourly, the screen freezes, hourly, Google assistant either quit, or is hard of hearing, and what battery…Oh talk to text….Well, let’s just say I’m not worried about artificial intelligence when we can’t even have a phone understand basic English, let alone, understand basic English. Well that’s all and just a note, it has crashed 3 times just making this comment. 04/25/2017 Flavius Reply Battery not charging in fast charge after Nougat update on Note 5 (Telus Canada). Before it took around 1h15 min to charge, now is more like 2h20min. The same problem on my wife’s Edge 6 plus. Also, there is no more multitasking option. 04/25/2017 Gareth Riddiford Reply My S7 Edge completely died this weekend after the update, will not charge or switch on. At the moment it is back to shop for repair. 04/26/2017 Shamika Reply My S6 is extremely slow since the update. My messenger app is constantly crashing, two days ago, the phone refused to turn back on for about 10 minutes, battery is draining fairly rapid, and I cannot flip my screen while watching movies unless it’s on Youtube and even then I have to press the full screen button vs it just going that way when I flip my phone. 04/27/2017 Rusty Reply Nougat is a disaster of an update for me (S6 edge). Mine will not stay connected to wi-fi. I’ve tried different wi-fi networks, rebooting phone, rebooting wi-fi, everything I can think of. It just connects for a few minutes then drops it for a few minutes then reconnects in a tireless loop. It’s also annoying that everytime it drops wi-fi and then connects to wi-fi, it gives an audible notification which I haven’t found how to turn off yet. My recommendation is to not update to Nougat until more of the bugs have been fixed. 04/27/2017 Bo Reply I have a Samsung Galaxy Note 5 on Sprint. I updated to Android 7 about a month ago and regret it every day. The battery drain is significant and likely due to the screen turning on its own after you have placed it into sleep mode by tapping the Power button. If you have somewhat poor vision, the Notification screen’s small light gray and blue text is horrifically hard to read under many conditions. The look and feel of the “minimal” design is a SIGNIFICANT step backwards. If Android 6 was re-released, I would be flipping cart-wheels and view it as a significant improvement. Note, I love technology and have never regretted an OS upgrade. I usually give it time for adjustment. Not this one. Android 7 ABSOLUTELY SUX, at least the Samsung variation does. Android 6 was rock solid in almost every way except the “Fully Charged” notification that wakes you up ea night with a glaring light. For what it’s worth, they didn’t fix that in Android 7 either. 04/28/2017 Jeffrey Reply I have a galaxy S6 and having issues with text/emails. I have a word typed ( correctly ) and it changes the word to something else. 04/28/2017 Marwan Reply Ever since the latest update (7.0), my Note 5 sometimes will not make an outgoing call. I slide the name to the right, it start to make the call but disconnects immediately. I have to restart the phone to re-gain calling out function. 05/05/2017 Laura Reply I’m having issues with my text messages just sitting there forever clocking forrrever and my pics aren’t going through ! Also won’t open an app. Just downloaded so believe I’ll run into more. HELP 05/06/2017 Nashmia Reply Im having issues after updating my phone. If I hide content to messages than I don’t notifications it only shows silent notifications then.. If i unhide mesaage content then pop up disturbs. It sucks.. help me get out of this 05/06/2017 Another Annoyed User Reply I have few problems with the Galaxy 6 Edge with the new nougat update! I really hate it and would like to revert back to 6.0.1. That was more stable. Is it possible to go back to the previous OS? Camera crashes – This is the normal camera app that comes with nougat. Very strange problem : It randomly starts doing things itself (not connected to 4g/wifi), like going to “recently used apps”. It starts going through each app, then back to “recently used app”. It feels as though someone else is controlling the device. However please note that its not connected to the wifi or the 4g network. Also, does anyone else finds that it HOGS your wifi connection? Like really throttles it? To a point where your WIFI connection hangs until you turn the WIFI off on the phone. Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published.

Skip to content Home News Sports Metro Plus Politics Business Entertainment Opinion Editorial Columnists Jobs Sections Search for: Information Technology Google hosts 200 Nigerian, Kenyan publishers Published May 9, 2017May 9, 2017 Share Tweet Share Pin it +1 Google Ozioma Ubabukoh Google will this week host publishers’ summits in Nigeria and Kenya, where over 200 publishers from across the region will gather to explore an opportunity to better understand Google’s Publisher tools, as well as the challenges and opportunities presented by an online ecosystem growing rapidly in both size and complexity. According to the company, the summits are the largest hosted by Google in Africa, to date. Through its summits, and other initiatives, Google said it was empowering publishers to make money online and drive traffic to their sites. “In this way, the company aims to give publishers the necessary support to help them monetise their content online, thereby creating opportunities for the industry to leverage technology in the digital world,” Google said in a statement. The statement also read, “The summits, which address the different issues being faced by publishers and advertisers, are designed to provide a more complete picture of the online ecosystem and the opportunities that lie ahead in 2017 and beyond. “Key focus areas include the changing consumption journeys of online consumers as well as the tools available to publishers to optimise their benefits.” It added, “With Google having achieved its 2016 goal of training one million young people in Africa on digital skills within a year, there is even a greater need for high-interest published content for online marketing as these web enthusiasts start their own ventures or assist other web entrepreneurs with theirs.” The Country Manager, Google Nigeria, Juliet Ehimuan-Chiazor, said, “Google’s relentless commitment to the growth and development of the people and businesses in Africa is given expression through summits like this as we deploy tools and initiatives to support businesses and individuals in Africa to grow.” According to her, Google enables publishers to sell their content directly to consumers through Google Play Newsstand, which now features some 4 000+ newspapers, magazines and blogs. “And its search and ads services help publishers make money online and drive traffic to their sites. Google shared more than $11bn with its publisher partners in 2016,” she added. In October 2015, Google joined publishers, analytics and ad tech companies and others to announce the Accelerated Mobile Pages project to dramatically improve the mobile web for everyone. “Google believes preserving a robust and independent press is important for the society. When excellent journalism succeeds, we all do better,” Ehimuan-Chiazor said. “This is why Google helps journalists use technology for reporting and acts as a collaborator and convener to listen and learn from those in the industry,” she said. Other initiatives driven by Google to assist publishers include the Google News Lab, which collaborates with reporters and entrepreneurs globally to help build the future of journalism, partner on projects, and build and adapt tools like Google Trends to help them in their work. In 2016, Google trained over 100,000 journalists directly. In February 2016, it opened Operation Shield — a tool for news orgs and human rights groups to protect themselves from the DDoS attacks — to all news organisations. “We boost content discovery and understanding through diversity tags like ‘opinion’, ‘highly cited’, ‘local’ and ‘fact check’ along with tools like ‘Editors’ Picks’ in Google News to allow editors to highlight original news content they believe represents their organisation’s best journalistic work,” Ehimuan-Chiazor said.  Copyright PUNCH.                All rights reserved.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars BOTS Google Home gets an I/O action (again) and a poetry reader Khari Johnson@kharijohnson May 8, 2017 4:24 PM Above: Google Home Image Credit: Google The selection of voice apps available for Google Home has grown larger in recent weeks, and now includes a Google I/O action, a guess-the-startup-founder game show, and a service that features favorite poems as read by actors and actresses. Voice apps on Google Assistant are called actions. Microsoft’s Cortana and Amazon’s Alexa refer to these as skills. More than a dozen third-party actions have been made available to Google Assistant for Google Home users in recent weeks, and more than 230 third-party actions are now listed by the Google Home app since the launch of the Actions on Google platform last December. It’s going to be an exciting, interesting few weeks in the intelligent assistant world as Microsoft is widely expected to release its Cortana software development kit and the Cortana Skills Kit for making third-party integrations for the intelligent assistant later this week at the Build conference. The Harman Kardon Invoke with Cortana inside is due out in fall 2017. Amazon is also expected to release a new touchscreen Alexa-enabled device this month just weeks after the Echo Look hit the market. The My Favorite Poems action made by Opearlo features poems read by professional actors. Each poem in the collection can be “pinned” or saved for later, so you can make your own collection of favorites as you listen to performances from actors and actresses. Could we get a poetry equivalent of Spotify that learns your taste and helps you discover new poems? I sure hope so. Last week VentureBeat published a story stating that a Google Home action for Google I/O was released, then pulled back. The action was likely pulled because it didn’t work. Well, Google has released the action again ahead of the conference taking place May 17-19 in Mountain View, California. Now it can give you a full description of any I/O session by topic from Google Play to VR to machine learning and AI. While the action has much to say about sessions, it’s mum on the keynote, where most of the news is actually made. Ask about keynotes and the Google I/O action says: “Oh, the keynote is going to be awesome this year. Sundar Pichai will start at 10 a.m. on the first day.” Ask other questions and the action may say little random things like “There are rumors of swag at I/O. Some say if you think hard enough it will appear.” In other new services, the UV Meter action will tell you the current ultraviolet (UV) rays index in a given city. This action joins others built to deliver information about the world around you, including actions made to tell you about tide levels and air quality. The Time Machine action will summarize and provide new headlines for any date in history going back more than 150 years. This skill draws upon New York Times headlines published between 1851 to the present. Continuing a trend of games for Google Home on Google Assistant, 6 Swords is an interactive role-playing game (RPG) that lets you “manage a team of six mercenaries.” In the game you can move in any direction through towns, prairies, castles, and dungeons. Players can collect gold, recruit other mercenaries, fight other players, and exchange items like gold or weapons. Each mercenary has a specific amount of hit points when they battle others, and players can interact via an online forum. The Guess the Founder game asks you questions about startup founders, and the Hitchhiker’s Guide Quiz asks Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy questions. As is sometimes the case in burgeoning voice app ecosystems, both of these actions are a great idea, but the data or corpus of knowledge they draw upon falls short. The same can be said of the new Date Night action. Examples of Google Assistant actions that draw upon large amounts of knowledge include WikiHow for DIY tips and the Bible reader action from bible.com. There’s also a Voice Tic Tac Toe action, which is exactly what it sounds like. Other recent additions include The Piano Guy, Utah Football Fan Trivia, and WUFT, only the second local radio station available as a Google Assistant action. Google Assistant actions, though in truth no actions are necessarily needed for radio stations since Google Assistant will play any radio station you ask it.

First up, Google is adding the ability to long-press on a link and download it. This feature is also available when you long-press a suggested article on Chrome for Android’s new tab page. Another new feature will let you save webpages for downloading later if you’re already offline. If you run into Chrome’s offline dinosaur, you can tab the button that says “DOWNLOAD PAGE LATER” and have Chrome automatically download the webpage when your device regains an internet connection. Finally, when you open a new tab in Chrome for Android, you’ll see a new offline badge on articles that you’ve saved. There’s a list of recent downloads on the page, too. These are solid additions to Chrome for Android. The ability to download webpages for offline reading can come in handy when you find yourself without an internet connection but still wanting some entertainment, like if you’re on the subway or on a plane without Wi-Fi. And now Chrome for Android can help you better prepare for those very situations.

Google's "Fuchsia" operating system is taking shape with a new design Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/08 10:01am PDTMay 8, 2017 29 Plus 1 on G+ 243 Share on Facebook 78 Share on Twitter Total Shares350 Development Google News We first talked about Fuchsia, a new operating system being developed at Google, back in August (in fact, it was my first post here). At the time, there wasn't much to get excited about besides the potential - it only had a command-line interface. Now the project has a snazzy new, but clearly unfinished, interface. Summary of Fuchsia First, it's worth going over exactly what Fuchsia is, because it's been quite a while since we talked about it. As opposed to all of Google's other OSes, such as Android and Chrome OS, Fuchsia uses the company's new 'Magenta' kernel instead of Linux. According to the project's documentation, Magenta is designed for "modern phones and modern personal computers with fast processors, non-trivial amounts of ram with arbitrary peripherals doing open ended computation." Magenta's apps and the system interface are written with Google's Flutter SDK, which was initially designed to create cross-platform apps for iOS and Android. Flutter applications are written in Dart, the company's home-grown programming language. All of the system and apps are rendered by 'Escher,' which uses OpenGL or Vulkan to display everything. The 'Armadillo' interface So, on to the new stuff. Fuchsia's system UI has a new name - 'Armadillo.' Ars Technica was able to compile Armadillo into an Android APK, since it is written with the above-mentioned Flutter SDK. The interface doesn't really do anything besides looking pretty, but it does give us an idea of what the finished product could look like. The home screen is a vertical list, with a profile picture, the time, and a battery indicator in the center. Tapping the profile picture brings up something similar to Android's Quick Settings, with toggles for auto-rotate, do not disturb, Airplane Mode, and so on. Above the profile picture is the 'Story,' which the documentation describes as "a set of apps and/or modules that work together for the user to achieve a goal." Currently, this works similarly to Android's Recents screen. Users will also be able to combine stories into a 'Story Cluster.' This is what dragging a Story card into split-screen looks like. Dragging a Story card onto another one triggers a split-screen mode. The user can split an app 50/50 vertically or horizontally, drag in another app for a 33/33/33 split, or even have a tab bar appear for using all the open apps in full-screen. You can even have two apps split vertically next to two other split apps, seen below. This is far more flexible than Android's current multi-tasking functionality, but whether or not it will stay this way is uncertain. Below the profile picture is a panel resembling Google Now, with a placeholder search bar and suggestion cards. Armadillo's documentation says, "a suggestion is a representation of an action the user can take to augment an existing story or to start a new one. [The] suggestion contains enough information to create the visual representation of that concept." So maybe they will work more like an app launcher? It's hard to tell at this point. The Google Now panel, showing Fuchsia's keyboard. Keep in mind that all of this is subject to change, as the Armadillo interface (and the rest of Fuchsia OS) is still under heavy development. It's also hard to tell what Google's plans are for the operating system. Will it be neglected to Internet-of-Things devices and other basic hardware, or will it some day replace Android altogether? We'll have to wait and see.

Suicide_Note Because Google can. Corbin Davenport Ron from Ars Technica put it best: "Fuchsia really seems like a project that asks 'how would we design Android today, if we could start over?' It's a brand-new, Google-developed kernel running a brand-new, Google-developed SDK that uses a brand-new, Google-developed programming language and it's all geared to run Google's Material Design interface as quickly as possible. Google gets to dump Linux and the GPL, it can dump Java and the problems it caused with Oracle, and Google can basically insulate itself from all of Android's upstream projects and bring all the development in-house. Doing such a thing on the scale of Android today would be a massive project." makapav Would it still be open source? Also, what would happen to all the existing APKs? Corbin Davenport Fuchisa is completely open source right now. As for running Android apps, maybe Google will add some kind of stop-gap compatibility layer for running Android apps, like Chrome OS has. destinyhud read the article Suicide_Note Perhaps instead of replacing Android, this will *become* Android, as in Android P or Q? Or be the merger of Android/Chrome? m477 I could see that as Android 10. Definitely too early for P. morteum I wonder if the reason it is called "Armadillo" is because they're starting from A again, but this time they're using animals instead of desserts. Christopher Bement I think it's a smart plan, based on the guess that there's more animals to pick from in the world than tasty desserts. teolinux Ubuntu docet Paul "Tasty treats," not necessarily desserts. That said, armadillos could be a tasty treat. I won't judge. MJ I have heard desserts and candy used before which are wrong but "tasty treats" is a new one for me. To be more accurate, Android names are actually all confectionery foods. A "tasty treat" could be a slice of pizza (aka Android S). LOL Randy Gindy Armadillo is the name of the UI not the OS build itself. Matt74UK Smooth on the inside, crunchy on the outside. Armadillo ! (a few UK people of a certain age may get that). John Doe Idk this is a whole new OS with a new kernel, I doubt this will be done with an OTA update for Android. Mantas Pakėnas Even nowadays, some of Android's new functionality cannot be done via OTA updates (like dual system partitions, forced encryption I believe, etc). To make a completely hard cut sometime when this is ready, and if it's meant to replace Android, is not completely unimaginable. As is updating via OTA. If apple was able to change their file system via OTA, I don't see why changing most of the parts would not be possible. However, nobody aside from Google would do it, almost guaranteed :) Suicide_Note It could likely be done for Pixel devices, and possibly for future devices released after this new version of the OS rolls out. Adrian Meredith quite possibly, after all there no reason it couldn't also run android apps jonathan What they need to do is make this googles very own os for their pixel line and leave android for the oems Suicide_Note Not a chance. To much name recognition with Android for Google to drop it in favor of something else specific to the Pixel lineup. Dallas King Android Z confirmed! Suicide_Note More like Android A for Armadillo. m477 APK plz (no, really, I want a compiled apk the demo) Maxwell “Max” Weinbach https://github.com/fuchsia-mirror/sysui MJ Your link wasn't what the OP asked for... Maxwell “Max” Weinbach the only way to get the APK is to compile it yourself, so I linked to the Github page to a place to download the files to compile. The closest they will get. MJ Than you should have replied there is no known APK or not at all. Maxwell “Max” Weinbach It does not matter that much. I am building the APK right now. Once it is done I will post it. Here is the link on how to compile it. http://www.hotfixit.net/single-post/2017/05/03/How-to-build-Armadillo MJ Don't waste your time... They updated that article with an download of the APK. Maxwell “Max” Weinbach thanks. they just did that. I still compiled it myself though. I will try to get more out of it while I have the Sysui downloaded. Michel R. https://www.androidfilehost.com/?w=files&flid=178684 there you go MJ http://www.hotfixit.net/single-post/2017/05/03/How-to-build-Armadillo Latex beats nudity More of Proprietary code ? No thank you, we already had enough with this Pixel crud. I hope this OS dies quicker or become a chromebook OS. m477 It's open source. Latex beats nudity It's OSS but just like Android It'll be more heavily dependent on the google APIs to make it work. Look at the Pixel SysUI, Just being OSS doesn't make it open source... It's Google's OS not a Linux Based one. If this is going to replace Android It's doomsday on multiple levels. destinyhud billions of people dont care if its running linux kernel or not. maybe very few like u might. do iphone users care why kernel it runs. none of them care. u r just noise tbh Latex beats nudity Billions of people don't code. You are being a kool-aid joke tbh. destinyhud exaclt only few code and even on that few many dont care if it runs linux or not. look at iphone there are more dev there and yet they dont care for kernel. u r delusional in ur own world m477 Android it's already been on a Google-dependent road for years. I don't think this is going to change either way. An Angry Chihuahua https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/magenta/+/master/docs/getting_started.md heres the source code. do some research my dude WitnessG Imagining this running on a Google made processor is exciting. Badouken If this was the OS for the Pixel 2 alongside a Google made processor I think id cry! WitnessG Yeah I don't see this coming out for at least another 2-3 years. Badouken Indeed, but we can dream! ha Suicide_Note Maybe the Pixel 3 or 4 will see the dream become reality. Suicide_Note I'm betting this is what we'll see in a couple years time. As another commenter stated, starting with Armadillo could be Google's way of starting from the beginning (letter A codename), since there's more animal babes to use for each letter than there are dessert names to use. Timothy Vreeland You are getting the furries excited. Nomaan Armadillo should be compared to holo/material and not to dessert names. nachofrand What makes you think Google would be good at making SoCs? They're a software company and don't have the hardware expertise for hardcore ASIC development like that. Granted they can hire people, but in the end, does it matter? They're going to use ARM either way. UnlikeABoss Google fanboyism. The same reason he's excited over a brand new OS. He knows absolutely nothing about it, short of the fact that it will create more fragmentation not only in the OS space, but also the kernel space. So all we know are negative things so far. This is what we call exciting now is it? Why? Just because Google is doing it? If Microsoft made this exact same announcement, would we all be excited? Oh dear. Zsolt V No, because essentially everybody loathes Microsoft. Almost nobody's life would be worse if Microsoft vanished. marcusmarcus2 Don't they design and build their own servers to use for all their websites? Seems like those hardware work well for them. Sergii Pylypenko It's one thing to assemble the server using off-the-shelf components, or even to order a custom motherboard. It's a very different thing to design and manufacture your own chips. marcusmarcus2 I'm not saying it is the same, just that they are not only software experts. Them designing and building the servers show they do have hardware expertise that could assist them in doing the same to chips. Zsolt V Except Google's servers are not assembled from off the shelf components. Haven't been for a few years now. Roy What about TPU? Adrian Vovk Samsung Exynos devices are faster than Snapdragon, iPhones seem underpowered but are extremely snappy, etc. The point is that making both the software and hardware leads to a very fast ecosystem. Also, Google are making the TPU for neural networks nachofrand Yes, as expected. Exynos is faster than Snapdragon on the Galaxy phones, but put an Exynos in another phone...oh wait, you can't. That's the whole entire point. Snapdragon SoCs are general purpose SoCs and can be used for a multitude of phones so they're not custom tuned to every phone individually. Exynos have very specific power rails and the chip is made specifically for that phone. The thing is, sure this is better, but it's marginal and hardly worth talking about. They both use the same ARM architecture so performance gains are pretty negligible. Besides that, this is how Samsung makes money....off of device sales. Google doesn't make money that way. That isn't their business model so at this point it doesn't make sense for them to build their own SoCs when they could just work closer with hardware companies. They make their own TPUs because it aligns with their business model. Adrian Vovk The instruction set doesn't really matter? I can have a 6700k and a 6500k and the 6700k will perform much better even though they are both amd64. With what Google is doing with the Pixels (still as snappy as day one here) I'm pretty sure they can optimize it further than Samsung does. They have made it run smoother in some cases on a chip that they didn't manufacture. If they made their own chip it would allow them many freedoms that they otherwise don't have = easier design of the device. I brought up the TPUs because that is experience in chip manufacturing Jason What makes you say iPhones are under powered ? Apples chips are some of the fastest around and are extremely powerful. Adrian Vovk Specs wise. They have much worse specs on paper and it would lead to a slower experience, except Apple can optimize it because they make both the chip and the OS Stephen Sharp They could use Risc-V and have to pay to license absolutely nothing, while being able to make processors purpose built for their OS Randy Gindy That would be an interesting move. Stephen Sharp Indeed, I really want Risc-V to succeed as an open ISA nachofrand They could. But in my opinion, it's unlikely. Google isn't trying to compete with Samsung and Apple in device sales and that isn't their business model. People using their services so they can show ads is their business model. It doesn't make sense for Google to make their own SoC when others are already doing a good job. Plus, if they went to RISC-V then what? What about the modem? They have to buy a standalone modem from Qualcomm or Intel. Now you have to hire system integration and test engineers to make sure the modem is working with your SoC. Oh and then you need a whole firmware team to control the modem. At that point, buy a full blown SoC with the modem on chip. Stephen Sharp Eh you lost me at "Pixel phone" and all the other hardware they sell. Google also is a Platinum member of the Risc-V foundation, and if there is a direction they are going, more control or less control, I would guess it's "more". But that's just a guess nachofrand Hardware isn't even close to the same thing as asic development. IC design is a different world. Granted they do some custom hardware, but SoCs are a much much larger feat. It's still a possibility they do so, but it doesn't make sense with their current business model imo. Captain On! 1 - Google has stated that they're going to make their own silicon for the Pixels in time. 2 - Google actually owns/operates the world's most powerful quantum computer. They know how to make chips. Randy Gindy That quantum computer was built by DWave though Angel I read (somewhere don’t remember) that they have three different quantum computers systems. One from DWave and two home-produced. From those two, one was made by engineers and not that disimilar from DWave in its operations. The other was made by physicists and uses a different approach. nachofrand 1. I could be wrong, but I've only read that they plan on working closer with chip manufacturers. 2. Google didn't make that computer. Even if they did, quantum is so different those skills don't even translate. Romario Maxwell Google made their own custom ASIC called the Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) for their AI/Machine Learning needs on their cloud platform. See https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2016/05/Google-supercharges-machine-learning-tasks-with-custom-chip.html and https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2017/04/quantifying-the-performance-of-the-TPU-our-first-machine-learning-chip.html nachofrand Sure, although a TPU is just an accelerator. Think of it as the hexagon DSP inside of the Snapdragon SoC. That's like 1/10 of the entire chip. SoC design is much larger. Timothy Vreeland How many examples of hardware design do people have to point out before you stop? Sure the hardware they worked on previously isn't exactly the same... But before they started the hardware they are currently working on, they worked on previous hardware that wasn't the same as what they are doing now. They have shown they are competent in designing many kinds of hardware. Or do you suggest a company can only build one kind of hardware and nothing else for all eternity? How did Samsung make it's current in-house chips? Did they go to ARM college? Have they been making ARM chips since the dawn of time? No. They put together some teams and got to work, so stop blabbing and being negative. sweenish Their AI that finally beat the world's top Go players was running on custom Google chips. It's not like they don't know how. Pixelexel Imagine a Google Pixel with a Google made processor, with Fuschia, with Project Fi with Google WiFi powered by Google fiber. If I'd have this, my life would be complete. Iamsecond Ha, no. A Google processor? Supported for 18 months, then replaced with a new processor that performs half as well (but has stickers.) Does not fully process Android code, because at Google one hand doesn't even know the other hand is there, let alone talk to it. Has 20 cores (only 2 enabled outside US for 'reasons.') Has a dedicated co-processor to enable ads in every app, even those that previously didn't have them. Jason Google can't even get a phone out the door without issues and you want them to make the chips too...lol. I'll pass. UnlikeABoss "In house kernel instead of Linux". Yeah, hopefully this dies in a thousand pits of fire. "Hey Linux guys, you know how you've helped us make billions over the years with a free open source kernel? Well, we were just using you to get the "nerd" userbase. Now we own the market thanks to you guys promoting its use of Linux, we will gradually phase you out." .... m477 I hope not. Linux is not really a kernel made with smartphone in minds. I don't care for being a fan of a kernel over another. UnlikeABoss Yeah. I'd much rather use a brand new untested kernel (and all the teething issues that will come with it) in my smartphone than a mature, stable one that's hacked on by hundreds and thousands of people every month. I mean, it's just a smartphone, we don't need it to be a secure environment, right? Let's just make a nice obscure kernel that no one else will use, and just say "but but it's open source!!! love us because we are Google kk". ... ihsan ışık I'm sorry but it just looks like you are a huge Linux fan and are just against change to me. UnlikeABoss Looks can be deceiving. If you're going to fling around the Linux fanboy term, i'll fling around the Google fanboy term, and that will surely be a nice constructive argument that we will both want to continue. m477 So, in 10 years we should still be using an unoptimised kernel like Linux, because anything newer is, well, newer? UnlikeABoss Yeah, because Linux hasn't changed at all in 10 years... m477 Yes, it changed a lot, and it still has many of the same problems, which are intrinsically bound to its structure. It's not a kernel well suited for mobile devices. UnlikeABoss You think the solution is to throw it out the window and start from scratch? I disagree. I'd much rather continue improving the Linux kernel, simply because of all the eyes it will always have on its code. jonathan Play nice ladies lol m477 With this mentality we wouldn't have Linux at all. Why start anything, while we can continue this other thing which purpose was completely different? A mircokenel is more well suited than a monolitic kernel to a mobile devices, both in terms of performance and security. No matter how much you improve Linux, it will never be a microkernel. UnlikeABoss Smartphones don't need a micro kernel in 2017. You could make that argument 7 years ago. Linux can be compiled with the required drivers just like it always could. m477 I made that argument 7 years ago. They always needed something different from Linux. The fact that specific, even proprietary drivers have to be integrated in the kernel (since Android lacks an abstraction layer) is on of the problems of the interaction Android-Linux. destinyhud why havent the nerds made linux on pc's a bigger market share if they were the one who made android a global leader UnlikeABoss No nerd is promoting Linux on the desktop. All social media used to be full of people promoting Android over iOS, these days there's no need to. destinyhud why havent they promoted desktop?? just wondering why they did for android but not for desktop.. linux on desktop was an underdog for decades. android was not popular because of kernal. android became popular because it was opensource and was the only viable competition to ios. people dont care what kernel it runs. UnlikeABoss No nerd worth their salt would promote an environment that would be a downgrade from Windows. Android was not a downgrade from iOS at any point in time, it had a very equal playing field. There's a difference between promoting a good solid FOSS kernel where possible, and promoting an agenda. m477 Android was not a downgrade from iOS at any point in time By this, I get that you never used Android and iOS side by side in 2009-10. UnlikeABoss You clearly value different things. The hackability alone made it an upgrade through its lifetime. m477 The same can be said for GNU/Linux on desktop. UnlikeABoss No it can't, because hackability =/= app availability. i.e. The hackability on Linux desktop doesn't make it win over it's lack of apps, where that isn't an issue on Android. m477 App availability was horrible in the early days, compared to iOS. Even Symbian had more apps. UnlikeABoss That was fine since the early days didn't consist of using your smartphone for very much, due to under powered hardware. Techies didn't go around saying "use iOS because we can all take selfies and stick filters on it". m477 iOS devices didn't have front cameras until mid 2010. The system was better, faster, smoother, the interface was coesive, there were many more apps, and the jailbreak community, to address the techie audience you like to go on about so much, was very, very good. There were tweaks and modifications that even the wildest Android custom ROM didn't have at the time. Android was objectively a downgrade, as much as Linux was on desktop. UnlikeABoss Calling jailbraik an advantage over a FOSS OS is pretty hilarious. iOS wasn't popular because it was better, it was popular because of the amount of people getting their advice from paid employees in store. "Buy iOS so we get a commission". m477 iPhone was more popular for various reasons: marketing, having 2 years of advantage, and, yes, more marketing. But it was also better than Android, as an OS. What benefit did Android bring, with it being opensource, compared to iOS, even to a "techie"? The dev community was laughable in the early days. Why GNU/Linux on desktop was not promoted by "techies" (which is false) and Android was, even if their shortcomings were identical? destinyhud u live in a dream world. even most dev dont care about kernel. what they care about the dev platform. I am a dev and i dont care for the kernel UnlikeABoss If you're talking from the perspective of an app developer then ofcourse you don't care about the kernel, you care about which platform will make you the most money... destinyhud exactly. no one care what kernel it runs.. all dev care is what platform make money. so who is this nerd who care about kernel if most dont care about the kernel.. yeah very very few.. infact rare like u UnlikeABoss Techie == Technology Enthusiast. You can sit here and tell me that you would use the best dev environment all you want but the truth is if the iOS dev environment was awful you'd still suck it up and use it to make your money. I'm not sure how you can class yourself as an enthusiast at that point. destinyhud ever wonder why no one is up voting u and upvoting many of my comments? because what u say is BS. its that simple. I am up for ditching outdated linux if the new kernal is modern and build for modern devices. most dont care for this very few techies.. i hope this becomes true and linux kernel die.. UnlikeABoss "Ever wonder why Google fanboys upvote pro Google content and not anti-Google content?" No, no I don't wonder that. How dare someone critique a pointless change by Google, causing unnecessary fragmentation. Burn them! destinyhud u must be new here.. look at anti google comments here when they make stupid changes but if they make welcome changes people tend to agree UnlikeABoss No, I've been here a long time and made many anti-Google comments as well as pro-Google. No one in the right mind would cheer on kernel fragmentation other than those that think Google can do no wrong. destinyhud open up ur comments history and let me see if u made pro google comments. i have a feeling u r a troll UnlikeABoss Yeah, this discussion is going no where. You are not the authority here and the idea that you want to browse my history to make sure I fall in line is creepy as hell. Bye. destinyhud lol i see u dont want to open ur comments history. obvious troll m477 outdated linux i hope this becomes true and linux kernel die Woah, wait a second here. Linux is not outdated, and its death would be terrible for everyone. It's just that it's not the most apt kernel for a mobile device. destinyhud maybe not outdated but not the right fit for mobile devices. destinyhud android sucked when compared to ios.. it was a downgrade compared to ios. why did dev promote android and not desktop linux? u reasoning dont even make sense. UnlikeABoss No, it wasn't a downgrade. destinyhud yes, it was back in android initial release. iOS was better and much more polished at that time. but things changed now. UnlikeABoss "Polished" is not a factor that is used to judge a better OS. There are Linux environments that are much more polished than Windows 10, but that doesn't make desktop Linux better. destinyhud it was both polished and runs better than android at that time. polished was not the only one. it was also polished. android only got better later.. i have used android at that time and it sucked big time. UnlikeABoss You are using today's standards to judge it. If you do that, they both sucked. It worked perfectly fine for the basic things people were using it for at the time. destinyhud they both sucked at that time but android sucked more than iOS at that time. SVem26 I like to think I am in the nerd userbase and I don't care what kernel is used.. can you help me understand why it matters? UnlikeABoss Do you want a brand new obscure kernel in thing that holds most of your sensitive details? TipTop I don't want something that dates back to 90s, is full of zero-days and horrible code contributed by nobodies. UnlikeABoss The idea that it is full of zero days is hilarious. You do realize that the majority of Linux exploits are local, right? Unlike Windows. Yes there is obviously code from the 90s, but very, very little of it. Not to mention that age is not a factor in deciding bad code. The idea that old code is bad code shows your inexperience. By that standard, should we dismiss Chrome because of all the exploits being found in code that was written when it first started? Are we going to create brand new software every few years to purge "old code"? Do you have any idea whatsoever how much Linux has actually changed? Do you have any idea how much of this change is because it's considered a "universal" kernel everyone can use and is focusing on? Do you really think splitting the community over onto another kernel will increase security for either of those kernels? There's a little something called code maturity. There's a reason Microsoft has way less exploits in its kernel today than 10 years ago. They didn't write a new kernel from scratch. Sir_Brizz All OSes are full of vulnerabilities and horrible code written by nobodies. If that is your requirement then you must have gone full luddite by now. ihsan ışık Are you implying that Android got popular because of "nerds" who heard it uses the Linux kernel? UnlikeABoss If you are old enough to know the early days of android you'll know that having every single nerd on the internet promoting Android over iOS most certainly helped get the ball rolling. Once it was pushed, it snowballed into what it is today. m477 Sure. It was the nerds on the internet, not the manufacturers with ads everywhere. Most people still don't know their Galaxy runs Android. UnlikeABoss The giant billboards came YEARS afterwards, cmon. m477 Yes, and that's why Android was so unpopular in the early days. UnlikeABoss What? It was massively popular among all techies for being the open source iOS alternative. m477 You are overestimating the "techies" crowd. Even BlackBerryOS was more popular at the time. Only after the Galaxy S it started to grow, and became popular among normal people. UnlikeABoss Not really. We are talking over a decade ago now, there were far less people on the internet and it was far easier for techies to promote products because everyone was asking their "techie" friend what is best. But these days everyone is an "expert" so that's not as much of a thing. m477 Again, you overestimate how many techies there actually were. Your personal experience is anecdotal. Market shares and sell data are objective. Also, over a decade ago Android was still a camera os, and it wasn't public. UnlikeABoss No, I do not. The further back in time you go, the higher the proportion of techies there were using the internet versus others. People were only just starting to look at buying a smartphone, and asking techies what they should buy. m477 Yes, the concentration on the internet of "techies" on the internet was greater. And? What normal user at the time went to the internet, looked at reviews and said "Oh, look! The HTC magic has Linux! This random guy says its good, so I'm gonna buy it!"? You really think that a bunch of "techies">marketing? A guy saying that his toy-looking HTC G1 is better than the iPhone is more effective than billboards and tv ads? Come on, even Windows Mobile was more popular. It took Samsung's aggressive marketing to make Android popular. UnlikeABoss Windows Mobile and BlackBerry were more popular in the enterprise, that's it. The entire discussion is home users. Also I think there's been some confusion. I wasn't implying that techies on the internet were promoting Android on the internet like a marketing department. I was implying that the internet was very much a "social media" platform for techies to communicate where the majority of them would use Android and mocked the use of iOS. The actual "marketing" happened offline when a normal user would ask their "techie" friend for first time buying advice. It is nothing like that today, and the internet is nothing like the techie community it once was. m477 So, what you're saying is that the internet was a circlejerk of Android users. Ok, and? It didn't affected normal users the slightest, iOS was still more popular until Samsung took Android more seriously. The techie friend thing its only your anecdotal experience, it bears no influence on the market, in the grand scheme of things. I'd even argue that Google's very light marketing did much, much more. Also, the mindless techies that recommended half backed devices instead of better alternatives because "Uh, Linux!!" did more harm than good, both to the users and to Android. UnlikeABoss If you read my OP you'll see my original point was that Google has rode the "Android circlejerk" to popularity, and you can debate how much popularity that added as much as you want. The fact remains, it got the ball rolling. Samsung didn't pick it up "just because", it saw that a lot of people were pushing it. There were several OS at the time it could have used, including sticking to its own. Why bother with Android? Maybe because it wanted to see how much market it could take by appealing to techies? However, if you stand back and look at it, how is this any different from "embrace, extend, extinguish"? Google used that "free marketing" and has now decided to use it's massive popularity to push a different product. (Which has failed in the past and will hopefully fail again). Why hate Microsoft for doing that in the past, but we praise Google for doing it? Why are we excited for something we know nothing about that is creating fragmentation? m477 Samsung had used several OSes, it had Windows Mobile and Phone devices, Symbian devices, and proprietary devices, even Palm OS devices IIRC. They used them all. Android had was the easiest to personalise for them, and create a copy of the best selling product, which was the iPhone, and there was an app market, so they tried to release and market their flagship with it, and market it as broadly as Apple. The first Galaxy (the "non S") was was vastly ignored, because it was as little marketed as all their other devices. The techies crowd was insignificant. The free marketing is just as much as Windows 10 gets for incorporating Ubuntu's bash terminal. What you saw is not really important. I saw lots and lots of Windows Phones in 2010 and 11. Many more than Android devices. Every one I knew had one, and if I had to say which OS was the most popular only based on my personal experience, in my smallish city, I'd obviously would say Windows Phone. Why are you so attached to Linux, excluding all possibilities of giving a possibly better solution a try? The community will just fork the AOSP and continue the development of the Linux branch. UnlikeABoss Cmon, we both know Android was not easier for them to customize than simply using their own OS. No one was recommending it, techie or not, no matter how much they marketed. It's only now they are popular they are trying to slip in their own OS, and still failing. I am not attached to Linux despite people using it as an easy scapegoat to dismiss a discussion critiquing almighty Google. We currently have a situation where most kernel developers focus entirely on Linux, making it virtually the universal kernel. Why are we creating pointless fragmentation there? Why divide that community? Do we honestly believe that a divided community can produce a better kernel, or do we love it because Google is doing it? Would we love it if Microsoft did this? m477 The proprietary OS they used at the time was a Java based thing with a flash interface. Hardly able to compete against iOS. It was easier for them to use the "next Symbian" that they could customise as they wanted, and that also had an app market. If they made, say, Bada, before Android become established and popular, and marketed it as much as they did with their Galaxy S, the market would be very different today. The normal user doesn't care what OS their shiny phone runs, as long as there's facebook. I am a GNU/Linux user since the first half of the 2000s, and I've always critiqued Google for using Linux as a kernel on phones. Linux might be the universal kernel, but smartphones need a more streamlined solution. I don't care if it's Google, the MIT, or Richard Stallman in person to do it. I liked WP8 architecture. Fragmentation is not pointless if it brings benefits to the user. TipTop Nobody cares about your FSF agenda. John Q I think the chief reason Google is not using Linux is that they want a real-time OS (RTOS). Linux is at best a "soft" RTOS, possessing a real-time scheduler but this is still not nearly as real-time as an actual RTOS should be. It would take a very large effort to do that for Linux so it makes sense that Google would want to make their own kernel that they can have full control over. UnlikeABoss Let's ignore the fact that Linux is used in real time car systems for a moment. Could you elaborate on why you think Google would want/need a RTOS on their smartphones? M6 The kernel they're using, 'magenta', is opened source. So who cares if they're using linux or not? Does everyone have to use linux? UnlikeABoss No it doesn't have to be Linux. But who else will use Magenta? Probably no one. So why are we fragmenting the kernel space further? Why would you choose an immature kernel for something as valuable (your data) as your smartphone. Would you trust that? I would much rather developers continue focusing on a single kernel. WesleySmalls But wouldn't Magenta be this single kernel? UnlikeABoss If everyone decided to ditch Linux and focus purely on Magenta as the universal kernel, yes. Will that happen? WesleySmalls Could be, just not overnight. The market was already fairly well developed when Linux arrived in 1991, yet it still managed to become a very, if not the most, important player in the market. It's certainly possible, it will just require proper investment(and neglect of their alternate platforms) and patience to make it work M6 That's some straight up communist shit right there. Let's just work on one thing, because we only need one thing, everything else is redundant! Let's not allow other people to do the same thing in a different way, because competition totally doesn't spur innovation at all. WORPspeed So Andromeda definitely dead or still happening? sleepinlight Pretty sure this IS Andromeda, or at least a part of it. Andromeda was never an official name for anything, it was just the internal project name for some sort of new and/or merged OS. WORPspeed I thought Andromeda specifically referred to merging Android and Chrome OS. So is that specific merger dead or on life-support? John Q Nah, the Android/Chrome merger was just speculation from what Andromeda seemed to be. There was never any concrete evidence to imply that Andromeda was a merger. WORPspeed To quote Androidpolice : "So please, when you see Fuchsia mentioned, or speculation that it "is" Andromeda, know that it is just that: speculation. Last we heard from sources we consider extremely reliable, Android was the basis of Andromeda, and Andromeda would see its commercial debut on a new Pixel laptop later this year. It is possible Google has changed plans around Andromeda, that the initiative itself may have even been scrapped. Though, we have no reason to think so - it's more that we don't know, and haven't heard anything about Andromeda in quite some time." http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/02/15/speculation-around-googles-fuchsia-os-and-andromeda-is-creating-confusion-and-misinformation/ WORPspeed http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/02/15/speculation-around-googles-fuchsia-os-and-andromeda-is-creating-confusion-and-misinformation/ That makes them seem very separate Srujan https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/e7fda716dfcfdca76e200e51a9c9144c72e183c7e76d36b910c20ee0931aee79.gif destinyhud if this replaces android rather than having 2 separate codebase, I am all up for it. splitting the android community is dangerous senor_heisenberg Well if this does end up being what replaces Android or what Android evolves into, I just hope my apps and whatnot are compatible. Ain't got the time or money to be investing into another ecosystem. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman That's a tricky, double-edged sword. I can't fathom they would not support the old apps, or at least the vast majority of them, for exactly that reason. But in doing so it will likely be held back at least slightly from what it can/should be. Backward-compatibility tends to hold everything back. What I'd wager is we won't see this until hardware's powerful enough to make emulating the old system in a VM relatively cheap and easy, with back-end Play Store penalties to developers who don't shift to the new app models, and then slow phase-outs in stages of the older functionality and support until the new OS is running exclusively its own setup. senor_heisenberg That sounds good. Randy Gindy I think Google porting the Android Run-time to Chrome OS was to see if they could do it. morteum This is old news, I'm waiting for Fuchsia 2.0 Barracuda. /s marcusmarcus2 What if they aren't going by Animal names in general but by mammal names. I'd skip the Fuchsia 2.0 Bandicoot. It will probably be "Crash" prone. Alfonso Surroca Three operating systems is not nearly enough. We need at least two more announced at I/O. Suicide_Note One OS for each Google messaging app. AbbyZFresh If this is not customizable, the Andorid OEMs won't be liking this one bit.

Suicide_Note There is no update problem. Nexus/Pixels run the latest and greatest. OEMs who mess with the OS give their customers severely delayed updates. pfmiller Nexus and Pixels run the latest and greatest for two years. Nobody would accept this OS update situation if it was on a desktop OS. MJ Thank God it's phones we are talking about and not a desktop PC. marcusmarcus2 That is exactly why Windows XP lasted only a couple years before all computers updated to Windows 7... Seriously though. I'm fine with only getting Android version upgrades phones for 2 years. But they really need to extend out security updates beyond 3 years. Suicide_Note This isn't a desktop OS, not to mention people tend to change phones much more often than their desktops. pfmiller Sure it's not a desktop OS, but no sense pretending that what we have leaves nothing to be desired. And sure people change their phones more often that their desktops, but there's absolutely no reason to change every 2 years. Doby Gillis Which is a problem, Einstein. Suicide_Note Not if you're a Nexus/Pixel owner, Dilbert. Randy Gindy I would generally say there is. Android phones are not supported for nearly as long as an iPhone. The reason being that the chip set manufacturers do not release new drivers. Shelly-Man Vol 2 It's looks pretty neat for a development stage. Rami Well Android has to reach Z someday. In the case, Hello Fuchsia! marcusmarcus2 Those split-screens will be really useful for running of of Google's different messaging apps. Hopefully OS's aren't the new messaging apps of Google.

Michel R. https://www.androidfilehost.com/?w=files&flid=178684 Rick Kode Does it replace any system files? My phone isn't rooted so can't change it Michel R. You can install it just as any other apk WesleySmalls "Will it be neglected to Internet-of-Things devices and other basic hardware, or will it some day replace Android altogether?" Neither, this is just a side project many developers use to test and work out the feasability of a variety of things. Android is a very well developed environment, and replacing it whole is simply a no-go. Things will just gradually evolve, as they have already done with Dalvik being replaced by ART, for example. Sir_Brizz I don't think you're wrong, but it would be in Google's best interest to start building a non-JVM runtime that apps can run inside with a native language that Google has 100% full control over like Go or Dart. Тарас Мукин 1. This is definetelly Chat UI! It came from Telegram bots and whatsoever, and it is so smart of Google to be developing it now. Feels like it's going to be next big UI-change after Apple came up with apps divided into screens. 2. "Magenta is designed for ... non-trivial amounts of ram" This is going to be optimised sooo bad. Alex De La Rosa I bet theyll announce 2 new messaging apps along with that PI 5 msg Apps for 3 Os is dam low ,,,, expecting it to be 10 Calvin Wankhede That guy who bought fuchsiapolice.com sure is waiting for his investment to pay off, isn't he? Nicolas Bahamondes Fuchsia Police... Alvin My money is on this turning into a really useful and innovative messaging app. Oh, with stickers. Superman Not happening, just like module phone. Lol Cyber Jethro I personally think this is for embedded systems like shopping kiosks or other customer service applications. Zach Mauch "Will it be neglected to Internet-of-Things devices and other basic hardware" Did you mean "relegated", not "neglected"? PVL_93_RU Those "stories" on the "home screen" look like they'd fit perfectly for a kiosk-type display, where you have a lot of space to work with JG Fuchsia is a purple-y pink color. T-Mobile's color is Magenta, a slightly different purple-y pink color T-Mobile is rumored to be looking into launching their own phone... Coincidence??? Almost certainly, without a doubt yes... But consider... T-Mobile also launched the first Android phone... yoloswag Inspired by the messaging team, Google wants to start working on a 2nd operating system. JG Magenta is designed for "modern phones and modern personal computers with fast processors, non-trivial amounts of ram with arbitrary peripherals doing open ended computation." Modern personal computers huh? I've been interested in Google packing ChromeOS into a LiveCD type set up we could test/install on our own computers... (*Yes, I know of Chromium, haven't tried it yet... But I would prefer it coming direct from Google, faster updates and all that). It could be interesting to try out another of Google's OSs without having to fork over several hundred for new hardware... The only problem would be drivers to support the various hardware. If not modified too much, ChromeOS could possibly use the original Gentoo Linux drivers. But with Fuchsia using its own unique kernel... That might throw things off a bit... I know a few less tech-savey individuals who would probably be more comfortable if the same OS powered their phone, tablet and desktop (should Google opt to replace Android with Fuchsia). Especially if it could run both Android apps and Chrome extensions natively. Zxyon Rhysivz This could be the beginning of distros for Android. *Imagines Ubuntu Android* Peter World Citizen This will run in parallel with Android.

A free hardware kit shipped with the latest issue of The MagPi allows subscribers to turn their Raspberry Pi into a voice-controlled virtual system. Inside the magazine, you’ll find a Google Voice Hardware Attached on Top (HAT) accessory board, stereo microphone PCB add-on board, speaker, large arcade button, a selection of wires, and the custom cardboard case used to house all the components. Makers are encouraged to build a cardboard device that uses the Google Assistant SDK to answer questions like “What is the weather in Bangor, Maine?” or “What is 827 divided by 19?” The experimental system—compatible with the Raspberry Pi 2, Pi 3, or Pi Zero—enables you to hook up the “little box that talks to you” to own personal projects. Folks can also create custom commands to summon various functions like turning on the lights or controlling the robot butler. Latest issue of The MagPi (via Raspberry Pi Foundation) Keep in mind, however, that it does require some software setup before use, and is “not a Google Home replacement,” The MagPi‘s Rob Zwetsloot reminded readers in the comment section of a recent blog announcement. Subscribers should have received issue 57 of the fanzine last week; everyone else can pick up the magazine at Barnes & Noble (US) or WHSmith, Tesco, Sainsbury’s, and Asda (UK). Those folks not blessed with the do-it-yourself gene who are simply interested in reading the latest Raspberry Pi News can snag a copy of the periodical online, via the official Android and iOS apps, or as a free PDF download. “The folks at Google, along with us at The MagPi, are really excited to see what projects you can create (or enhance) with this kit,” Zwetsloot said, “whether you’re creating a voice-controlled robot or a voice interface that answers all your questions.” Currently available only with a copy of the magazine, the AIY Project kit is not it remains unclear whether the AIY Project kit will be available for sale separately in the future.

Popular Stories POLICE RAID: Ipswich officers charge 35 people Allison's children will finally get $800,000 payments UPDATE: Forensic crash unit investigating serious rollover Local Real Estate Subscribe Now Your phone has been keeping a comprehensive list of everywhere you've been - and you might not even know. Whether you use iOS or Android, handsets have ways of watching where their owners are going and keeping a record of all of that information. The data can be a very useful way of reminding yourself where you've been or when exactly you went on a certain trip. It also allows the phones to tell you useful information by knowing where you tend to go and on what days. But it can also be a strange way of remembering just how much information some technology companies store about your life. Google has perhaps the neatest way of looking at all of that information on its Your Timeline page, which used to be known as Location History. You can head there and see a map of everywhere you've been with your phone - grouped into trips and dates. The site uses the data for its various location-aware tools, including Maps and notifications that can make you aware of things that are happening nearby. It's from that same page that you can opt to enable the tool if it's not already turned on, or to pause it. If you're on Android, then the tracking feature can happen using just the phone. On iOS it needs an app - the Google app, for instance, can track your location and send it to Google while it sits in the background. Google also makes it easy to turn off location information, and to delete either everything or specific parts of the information that it has stored. To turn the whole thing off, you can head to your Google account and turn the "Location History" switch off. Since you're doing that at the account level, it will change whatever device has been tracking you.To delete it, you head to the location history page above and select either a day or location and opt to delete that history. Otherwise you can pick the "Delete all history" option to get rid of the entire thing. Apple also does something similar, in its iPhones. To see the list, you can head to the Settings app and click on Privacy. There you'll find an option for Location services, which is also the place you can disable any other app from tracking you. Scroll down to the bottom of that list and find the setting for System Services. Click on that and choose Frequent Locations. In there you'll find a list of everywhere you've been and how many times you've been there. Like Google, Apple uses that information to understand more about what you do. It will be able to tell if you tend to drive home at a certain time each day, for instance, and suggest that traffic is looking bad if it is. It's important to note that none of Apple's Frequent Locations data is sent to Apple by default, and it just lives on your phone. That can make it less useful than Google's version - you can't view it on the web, and you'll lose it if you move to a new phone - but it also means that it won't be used for advertising or anythign else. delete Read More Login to follow google Read More Login to follow phone Read More Login to follow tracking Read More Login to follow turn off Read More Login to follow Topics:  delete google phone tracking turn off 0 PRINT Just In Family takes up state funeral offer for Lou Richards Woman's horse rolls over her in riding accident Horrible movies that made more than a billion dollars Federal Budget 2017: 'Bludgers' to have payments cut Marco Pierre White Jr apologises to Matt Preston AFLW expansion plans put on hold until 2019 Top Stories Have you seen these girls?

This is something separate from Android and Chrome OS that isn’t based on Linux and is essentially an all-Google product from top to bottom it seems. It’s kind of been around since last August, but recently was updated on some level with UI elements that give us a preview of what Google is up to here. I’m not really sure where to start because there is a lot to talk about, but the basics are as follows. Fuchsia is built on Google’s own kernel called “Magenta,” while the interface and apps are written in Google’s Flutter SDK (with Google’s Dart), a Vulkan-based graphics renderer called “Escher,” and all sorts of Google’s Material Design. It’s all Google, folks, something that can’t be said for Android.  So what’s Fushsia being built for? ArsTechnica has a good write-up of all of the dirty details, but their suggestion that this is Google’s way of creating something that is all them, that gives them full control and that works everywhere, makes a lot of sense. On the flip, you have Android that is built on Linux with Oracle’s Java and licensed under GPL (General Public License) and blah, blah, blah. Fuchsia, again, sure looks like Google making an operating system for phones and computers all from scratch for the most part. That’s right, this is an operating system that wants to be on smartphones and personal computers, with fast processors, and plenty of RAM. In recent findings, Hotfix discovered a UI preview for Fuchsia that is called Armadillo, hence the image above and the reason we’re talking about it today. Don’t go crazy and think that this now means Fuchsia is about to be shipped, but it does let us in on this radically different UI from Android and Chrome. Check out the video below to get a preview. It’s – obviously – very card-centric. You have a starting point that shows your profile photo along with time and location, followed by cards above that could be shortcuts to apps. It looks like some Google Now-esque action below too. So you can swipe through this areas to get to apps or drag-and-drop them to pull up multi window scenarios, resize windows, open multiple tabs within windows, and interact with Google from anywhere. I believe that is a home button as well that will get you back to the main profile image screen as you finish with an app or task. It’s pretty confusing, to be honest. Since this is in such rough, early shape, don’t take that as me drawing any conclusions. It’s clear that Google has a lot of work left to do here with Fuchsia and Armadillo. Either way, this is something to keep an eye on. Google is still working on it, so they do still care about it for now. Will they in a year or two? Insert shruggy face. Via: ArsTechnica | Hotfix Post navigation Previous StoryWaze Update Lets You Record Your Own Voice for Turn-by-Turn Directions Boomdizzle I’d be interested to see if an entirely new UI style would catch on. Windows tried it and failed miserably (granted the lack of apps didn’t help, I had a love/Hate relationship with my WP7 device UI I had for a hot minute.) I’m sure this is said every time a new OS or UI is shown, but I can’t see that catching on. Way too much real estate is taken up with the endless amount of cards above and below the main one. interstellarmind In my dreams they’ll bring back Project Ara from the dead and slap Fuchsia on it. MJ @Kellex I have read a number of articles elsewhere about this and yours was the only one that was NOT really clear that Fuchsia and it’s kernel “Magenta” are open source (you actually implied the opposite). You may want to add that information before a bunch of people get all bent out of shape.

Jeremy Turnley This is likely why Samsung has been pouring effort into Tizen, Bixby, and the like – likely Google will stop supporting updates to Android once this gets ready and with their focus on self-provided devices the future is uncertain for their partners. IBCRZY exactly. People talk crap about Bixby but Samsung is the only android oem smart enough to realize they can’t rely on Google or other partners for their OS and AI.

MJ Why does Samsung need Tizen again? Why couldn’t they just use Fuchsia? Jeremy Turnley You assume that Google will make licensing Fuschia an equal deal with what they charge for Android, or that Google will license it at all and will allow their infrastructure to be used after its done. Remember, Google can pull the Play Store from their partners at any time, it’s not open source. MJ I didn’t assume anything nor mentioned anything about future licensing of the Play store??? Google could pull the store but it’s one thing they make money on which is NOT selling phones. The fact is this is open source just like AOSP. Jeremy Turnley Fuschia? According to the article, it’s not open source, and nor is the Play infrastructure (which is why you must download GApps separate from an AOSP rom). Remove the Play infrastructure and Samsungs phones are suddenly as useful as the Amazon Fire Phone was. It’s entirely possible that Google will use Fuschia and the Pixel to move in the direction of Apple, close their new platform, and cease Android development. What Tizen and Bixby likely are is protection from this possibility. Samsung has already been slowly pushing out other pieces to make this happen over the last few years. MJ I have already pointed out to @Kellex in another comment his post was misleading… Fuschia is open source (also the kernel) and the news today was that someone complied the source form Google’s site so we can see these screenshots. LOL Yes, we know the Play Store and other bits are closed just like on Android. Yes, anything is possible but not sure why anyone would think Google is talking the iOS route considering it is OPEN SOURCE. I agree Samsung is hedging their bets but they have been taking steps well before Fuschia was known to exist. Dorian Brooks Fuschia isn’t open source. It’s about as locked down as iOS MJ That is 100% wrong… Do you only read Droid Life? https://www.xda-developers.com/googles-fuchsia-is-a-smartphone-os-with-a-new-ui-but-no-linux-kernel/ Ihavenewnike Android is a huge money maker though. The ad revenue they make from the android OS is what continues its development. Jeremy Turnley True, but Apple and it’s closed infrastructure makes more money than Android makes for Google, despite controlling a third of the market share.

Google's messaging mess is about money, not making your life easier (opinion) Trevor Newman View All Posts 2017/04/21 10:51am PDTApr 21, 2017 86 Plus 1 on G+ 398 Share on Facebook 127 Share on Twitter Total Shares611 Applications Editorials Article Contents 1 Explainer: business case 2 The falling tower of Babel 3 Money in the messenger 4 Say ‘ello to Allo 5 I’ve got 160 characters but "$" ain't one 6 Jibe talkin’ 7 Conclusion I have a simple rule in life—if something does not seem to make sense, look for the money. What I mean is that profitability is often the simplest explanation for a decision that might seem to make little or no sense to someone on the outside of a company looking in. How does this rule apply to Google’s messaging mess? Much ink, and possibly much blood, has been spilt over Google’s recent messaging app strategy (or lack thereof). To some, it is a mangled and unfocused mess of half-baked concepts sent out into the world for us to shill to our increasingly impatient friends and family. To others, it is part of Google’s master plan to move the world forward in a big way that most are too naive to see. In my humble opinion, the explanation may be much simpler: To understand the mess, look for the money. Explainer: business case What does business case have to do with Google’s inability to get its messaging app mess straightened out? We’re getting there, but that requires an understanding of another bit of business jargon called the business case. At large corporations, significant investments of time and resources usually require the approval of the chief financial officer (CFO). In the case of Alphabet, this person happens to be Ruth Porat, a highly successful and talented businesswoman who not only advised President Obama during the financial crisis of ‘07-’09 but who was also rumored to be a potential nominee for Deputy Secretary of the Treasury. In order to get a business case approved by a CFO like Ms. Porat, little else matters but the bottom line. If the bottom line is a net loss, there can be no justification for approval; if the bottom line is a projected gain, then the conversation can continue. And if the business case is compelling enough, a project can move forward. Edit: A portion of this section has been removed for potential inaccuracies around the concept of fiduciary duty in regard to a publicly traded corporation. -Man. Ed. DR. The falling tower of Babel So what does a compelling business case have to do with a simple messaging app? With the hiring of Ms. Porat and the consolidation of Google’s various business ventures under Alphabet, business lines were brought under increasing pressure to bring their costs in line with their revenues. In other words, a business unit can only receive money if it is making money. Under Alphabet, Google’s messaging platform must justify its contribution to the profitability of the company or, like any money-loser, it must either be reimagined or trotted out back to be put down. With that in mind, let’s take a look at Google’s messaging strategy prior to its consolidation under Alphabet. By 2015, all signs pointed toward the idea Google was moving toward a more integrated messaging platform. Two years prior, rumors of “Babel” were rampant and it seemed that Hangouts (though tragically named) would be the platform on which this integration would occur. But what we ended up with was an app that consolidated the instant messaging capabilities of Google Talk and Google+ Messenger with the video chat functionality already offered by the original Hangouts for Google+. Eventually SMS integration was added to the trifecta of instant messaging, video chat, and VOIP and the result was the closest thing to an iMessage for Android as we were going to get. While this may have been near single messenger nirvana (theoretically), in light of what we know now, the question remains: How was this strategy going to generate revenue? Money in the messenger For Apple, iMessage sells iPhones: it is often cited by customers as a reason for their allegiance to iOS. RIM (now Blackberry) made a similar justification when they shot down Jim Balsillie’s business case to make BBM compatible with competing platforms in 2012. The hardware team argued there would be no more reason for folks to buy Blackberries, and we all know how that played out. (Fortunately for Apple, iMessage is not the only reason people continue to buy iPhones, though that's a discussion for another time.) But as I alluded to in a previous column, Google is not a hardware company, it is an advertising company. Google makes its money by surfacing advertisements it deems most relevant to the consumer. It started off with search results, then email, then your phone--each new platform giving Google a little bit more insight into who you are, what you like, and what kind of ads you are more likely to act upon. Knowing this, what is the business case for a merged messaging platform? Where is the money? One potential business case for generating ad revenue from Hangouts would have been to read your private chats and insert recommendations and links to sites supported by Google’s ad platform into your conversations. In my eyes, this would have been a very difficult case for Google to make to the consumer, as it would have been seen as an invasion of privacy into a known entity. Rather, instead of shoehorning the functionality into an app with a notoriously complicated backend and hoping that users would be amenable to the inclusion of this new functionality, it is my belief that Google sought to instead build a new app from the ground up. Not only would this give Google a chance to reframe the chat intruder as an “Assistant,” it would give them a fresh foundation upon which to build out a messaging platform with a revenue driver already in place. Finally, I feel that the introduction of Allo enabled Google to repurpose Hangouts into a diminished but more focused role as an enterprise chat and conferencing client within the high revenue, low margin G Suite. A money loser on its own, Hangouts is now part of a high earning team. Say ‘ello to Allo I previously mentioned that one way to generate revenue from messaging is to somehow use the content of the messages to drive ad revenue. This is essentially what Google Assistant is in Allo (and now M in Facebook Messenger). For those of you who have used Allo: Do you remember connecting your Google account to the service when it suggested doing so as it would give you more personalized recommendations? Do you remember how friendly and enticing it was to give it access to your location? “I may share your location when I help you in chats with friends.” Heck it even pre-populates a response for you to tap that says “Ok, go on.” As shady as this sounds, these are very masterfully designed opt-ins and I cannot fault Google for crafting them in such a friendly way. The more information Google gets from your chats, the more relevant content the Assistant can generate for you to click on. The more relevant the information surfaced by Assistant is to you, the more likely you are to click a link to a website that hosts Google ads. The more of these websites you are driven to the more money Google makes which increases profits, and enables them to bring that good news to shareholders. Allo was built from the ground up to earn its keep. Whether it is successful is yet to be seen. I’ve got 160 characters but "$" ain't one Now that we know how Google plans to make money from Allo, why not just build SMS fallback into Allo and call it a day? Well for one thing, most of the world has moved on from SMS and uses the much better over-the-top (OTT) method of messaging that serves as the basis for Allo. Additionally, SMS gives Google zero insight into your personal habits and provides them little opportunity to generate any form of revenue. Even if Google were to build SMS fallback into Allo, it would still require both ends of the conversation to have Allo installed in order to drive the rich messages and site links that drive their revenue model. Therefore from a business perspective I can see little incentive for Google to invest in building a reliable SMS fallback system that serves only a portion of the user base and cannibalizes the revenue model upon which Allo is built. Unfortunately for Allo, not having SMS fallback in North America all but ensures it cannot be successful. In fact, SMS usage has increased in North America and represents almost 75% of all mobile messaging in the US and Canada. The only ones who have ever made money from SMS messages are the carriers and it is clear that they will not give it up unless there is a more viable alternative capable of making them more money than SMS charges. That alternative may already exist in the form of Rich Communications Services (RCS). Jibe talkin’ RCS is a rich messaging standard which many thought would have already replaced SMS by now. Like OTT messaging platforms, RCS is capable of handling the kind of rich communications that would enable a company to indirectly drive revenue by surfacing a link to a partner website, a coupon to make a sale, or the ability to quickly pay off a bill, all within the four walls of the instant messenger. However, unlike OTT messaging services, RCS is dependent on carrier and OEM buy-in and integration to support its proliferation. It is no wonder, then, that it has taken so long for RCS to catch on. However, now that OTT messaging services are showing carriers the compelling revenue models around rich messaging services, slowly but surely they are catching on. Google showed its hand in 2015 when it purchased an RCS platform developer called Jibe. On acquiring Jibe, Android RCS Software Engineer and Minister of messaging Mike Dodd said, “Jibe is a leading provider of RCS services and they’ll continue helping carriers easily deploy RCS to their users.” He mentions carriers for a very specific reason: Because almost nothing runs through a carrier’s pipes unless it’s profitable for the carrier to use it. Since the acquisition, Google has worked quickly to build RCS support into the Android Messages App and has begun exerting its influence on weaker OEMs to pre-install it on their Android devices. Now all that’s left is for the carriers to support the universal RCS profile, which is no mean feat. While the big four US carriers are all signatories of the universal RCS profile, and a number of carriers and OEMs have either vowed to implement the universal profile or have at least implemented a proprietary version of RCS, time will tell if the standard takes off or gets stuck struggling in the mire of hubristic competition that has dragged out the long slow death of SMS. Conclusion From a frustrated consumer perspective, Google’s messaging app strategy looks scatterbrained and impulsive; appearing to make little or no sense. However, from a business perspective, it shows a company actively seeking out new ways to generate revenue, drive its bottom line, and keep its shareholders happy. This then leaves you, the end user, with a couple of options: Abandon Android altogether and switch to iOS or some other niche operating system which won’t have any appreciable effect on Android’s market share. Keep doing what you’ve been doing; keep an app folder called “messaging” on your home screen and continue to piss off your stubborn iOS mates by sending them SMS messages until they download WhatsApp and stop telling you to buy an iPhone. I wish I could end this on a more enlightened note but Google is, at the end of the day, a business - and a business has to make money. And while they remain an impressive and innovative enterprise, I think we as end users falsely expect them to have a robust and seamless solution for everything. Android is a platform, and an open platform at that. There may be no all-in-one messaging client like there was in the halcyon days of desktop instant messengers and the XMPP (Jabber) standard, but Android as a platform is continually evolving and what the future holds is anyone’s guess. Perhaps then, we will one day look back upon this time with nostalgia as we tell our children’s children about what it was like “back in the day” when we communicated with many messengers and our home screens looked like this.

Google needs to understand that a functional, cohesive messaging platform is vital to Android, even if it's not directly profitable. Basically like the Android OS itself. David Ruddock Why? Why does it matter? What about a cohesive messaging model helps Google sell Android to the real customers (vendors - not you and me), when Android itself isn't even profitable? I understand it's a fairly cold and clinical way to look at it, but Google is very much shifting to a revenue-first strategy on products. Just look at Pixel: it is designed to make money, not to win grass-roots fans or showcase Android's diversity like the Nexus line was. Things are very much changing at Google (Alphabet), and it's pretty ridiculous to think that it's just that Google doesn't "get" messaging at this point. They're the second-most valuable company on earth. I think they "get" more than we give them credit for. It's just that their priorities and yours and nowhere near aligned. It's having negative ramifications for consumers, certainly, but I wouldn't call it an "excuse." Kyle Gospodnetich If Apple is also publicly traded and revenue-focused and they "get" messaging, why does Alphabet not? Arthur Dent Apple has a VERY different model for profitability. Luxferro I'm not an Apple user, but they also appear to have much more polished products, both software and hardware. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ The display and S Pen of a Note are the only things stopping me from switching to an iPhone. Arthur Dent I gotta say, the display of the 7+ is pretty spectacular, as is the camera. Obv no S-Pen or equivalent. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I haven't seen the 7+, but the 6S+ has a very nice display. Much better than I thought it would be. It's just that I'm so addicted to AMOLED. I will definitely be weighing my options on the Note 8 vs. the iPhone 8 this year. Arthur Dent Yeah, coming from a GS6, from the specs I thought OMG the Plus models "only" have 1920x1080 on a 5.5" LCD screen? Weak! Turns out I was wrong (which I can admit), that resolution is just fine at that size (no PenTile), and the colors are excellent. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Exactly. When my wife got her iPhone 6S Plus, I thought it was a terrible idea because of the LCD display. After I used it several times, I was really impressed with how good it looks. I also like the software. No, it's not as configurable as Android, but that novelty has worn off for me. And I'm so sick of Google's BS. Everything on the iPhone just works. With one exception. When an iOS update is waiting to be installed, some apps will crash. After I apply the update for her, everything just works again. I don't know why that is. Maybe the apps got updated first. Knowledgeborn Allah Interestingly enough, I bought my first iOS device - the iPhone 7 Plus - last year when it came out, just to see what all the hype was about. And, needless to say, I can definitely understand the appeal. It's better than any Android device I've owned, including the Pixel XL and Galaxy S7 Edge. So, I guess there's that... Jason Edwards Well the next iPhone is suppose to get an OLED screen (Made by Samsung ?) and several document leaks from Apple have mentioned the Pencil working with the iPhone. Whether they bring the Pencil to the iPhone or not is anyone's guess but if they do then you can move on over. We will gladly accept you. Scott Ricketts http://media2.giphy.com/media/IoQBWXhpwsd0c/giphy.gif David Ruddock Apple is almost 100% hardware revenue. Completely different business approach. Lock-in is very important to their success. Kyle Gospodnetich Isn't the high-price of the Pixel evidence of Google going down that path? PS: I am a Pixel XL owner and am definitely locked into Google's ecosystem. Arthur Dent A path on which they have only just begun. One Android phone model, out for less than a year, in the hands of maybe a couple hundred thousand customers vs. several thousand OEM phone models over nearly a decade in the hands of a billion. They have a long way to go, and yet, will never cut out their OEMs either, while Pixel will likely not dominate the market. So it will continue to have to rely on software/ad revenue much more than Apple. Knowledgeborn Allah Unfortunately, these aren't the same thing... Being locked into Google's ecosystem doesn't require any type of specific hardware. In fact, you can use almost all of Google's services on a regular PC by just going to their website. That's their ecosystem. Being locked into Apple's ecosystem is entirely different. For example, you can't make iTunes purchases, read iBooks, send and receive iMessages, talk to someone on FaceTime, or do any of that other Apple-specific stuff without an Apple device. In order to use their services, you have to buy their hardware products. I'm primarily locked into Google's ecosystem too, and my primary devices are an iPhone 7 Plus and an iPad Air 2. I have Android devices too, but I don't need them to stay connected within the ecosystem. dcdttu As easy as it is to say that Google's services (and ads) work perfectly well on both Android and iOS, that may not always be true. Of course you want your own platform to be the best it can be, and Android is 90% there - the glaring exception is messaging. Knowledgeborn Allah How do you explain the fact that nearly all of Google's apps run significantly better in iOS than they do on Android? Google Drive, Google Docs, YouTube, even Gmail - they're all much better and more optimized on iOS than they are on my Android devices, including my Nexus 6P and Pixel XL. Why do you think that is? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Because, Android, as a platform, sucks compared to iOS. Android has a richer API and gives app developers a lot more flexibility, but the basic platform is a mess. Knowledgeborn Allah 😂 I wouldn't necessarily say that Android "sucks" as a platform, but they definitely have their shortcomings. I'll just say that there's plenty of room for improvement. Lol ddevito Three reasons: 1. Java 2. JVM 3. Flexible app store approval policy Knowledgeborn Allah I see how that's true when it comes to traditional third-party apps... But Google's own apps? Why would they (Google) make THEIR apps more structured and standardized on a competing platform than on their own Android platform? Personally, I think it's because Google doesn't really care about Android. It's a means to an end (establishment of their software and services), and it's not the focus of their business. That's also why they won't fight SOC manufacturers to update Android for longer than 2 years. They don't really care about that, as long as you have Google Play Services installed. ddevito I don't know if I'd go that far, but I'd say their iOS devs are not the same devs who write their Android counterparts. Say what you want about Apple, but their dev platform is pretty sweet. Swift is amazing, Java can't compare. Time for Java to go. Knowledgeborn Allah I would completely agree with you concerning the Swift vs Java factor when it comes to development, if it wasn't for the fact that it's been like this for quite some time. Even when Apple was still using Java, iOS apps were still significantly better than the same apps on Android. Regarding their developers, I can't argue with that, because I honestly don't know. I just know that it seems to be a pattern. Most apps tend to be better on iOS than they are on Android, even though Android has a much larger consumer base. And Google's apps are included in that, and there are very few exceptions. ddevito It's also not just the language but the toolsets. Fire up XCode and open Interface Builder. Then run Android Studio and try to do the same thing. It's a joke. Even Microsoft's Xamarin solution is way better at designing UI elements for Android apps than Android Studio. Apple's software is light years ahead of Android's unfortunately. Knowledgeborn Allah I agree... I guess that's the unfortunate position Android is in right now. dcdttu This whole argument is ridiculous because if Google would have just made a kick-ass messaging platform with SMS fallback to begin with, they could have then baked in a unique and profitable solution like Assistant later. Everyone swears you can't have both and I don't know why. Jason Rittenhouse Because if you have both then you will use both, and Google doesn't want you using SMS at all because they can't monetize it. dcdttu The majority of Android users using the monitizable data-messaging service while a small minority are using the fallback SMS service is a helluva lot better than virtually nobody using Allo as it is today. Their gamble that Assistant was enough to get people to use Allo without SMS fallback/web client/multi-device support failed miserably. Jason Rittenhouse i didn't think that SMS fallback specifically was the reason nobody is using it (could be wrong though, just going off of personal experience here). personally, i don't care about SMS and don't know anyone else who does either. we all dislike allo regardless of SMS fallback. for us, the other missing features you mentioned are far more important than SMS. dcdttu SMS fallback is crucial for a universal app because it allows you to message people that don't also have the app. Just like iMessage. Most people that don't care about SMS are from a country that's not the USA. wicketr People buying Android phones vs Apple phones is more profitable to Google, right? I would hope that Google is concerned about indirect gains vs direct gains only. Right now, iMessage is the best. It not only locks people into iOS, but it draws people away from Android to iOS. That hurts Google financially. Google should want to create something that frees Apple users of the chains that lock them into iOS. They apparently don't care about that. I mean, why does Google/Android even have voice calling and SMS functionality at all. It's not like adding those features is directly helping their bottom line. Just let Apple make all the devices and focus on making apps/services for iOS, right? /s Knowledgeborn Allah Google makes their iOS apps better than their Android apps, interestingly enough... However, they still need Android to market their services on a wider platform for one major reason: Google Play Services, or, to be more specific, app permissions. Since Apple keeps their ecosystem locked down, there are a lot of things that Google Drive (for example) has access to on an Android device, that it doesn't have access to on an iPhone. The more Android phones are sold, the more information Google (Alphabet) has access to. bekifft No actually it's not necessarily more profitable. Google has tons of apps and services on iOS, many of which are (far) superior to their Android versions. wicketr Well if Android isn't as profitable as iOS for Google then they might as well shut Android down based on the entire point of this article. The only reason to have Android is to make more money than if they just ran all their services on iOS Bottom line is you are completely ignoring the value of Google Play and their entire ecosystem and not having to give Apple a share of their revenue. dcdttu If you're shifting to a revenue-first strategy, I suggest looking at one of the best in the business: Apple. Pay particular attention to their not-directly-profitable-but-massively-important-as-to-why-people-love-their-iPhone messaging platform. Again, iMessage isn't directly profitable for Apple but it's the #1 reason why my iOS friends will never leave the iPhone. I don't think you can find a better argument than that, direct profits be damned. Knowledgeborn Allah Very true... But we have to keep in mind that Apple is a hardware company. People stick with iMessage, among many other reasons, because it's universal across Apple's ecosystem. Android is too fragmented and diverse for Google to implement a plan like that. Not only do different OEMs have their own messaging services, but, in many cases, the carriers do too! It's very unlikely that all of them with consolidate under Google's banner, which is why Google is now experimenting with this new "Android Messages" platform. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ People stick with iMessage because it's universal across Apple's ecosystem AND you can still use it to SMS people who aren't on Apple's ecosystem. dcdttu That delicious SMS fallback that iMessage and only iMessage has. Allo's product manager flat said (via Twitter) that SMS fallback wasn't necessary because no one wanted it - showing how little Google actually knows about what makes messaging apps successful. This whole argument is ridiculous because if Google would have just made a kick-ass messaging platform with SMS fallback to begin with, they could have then baked in a unique and profitable solution later. Everyone swears you can't have both and I don't know why. Knowledgeborn Allah That's true, and I don't know why people say Android can't have SMS fallback because of Apple's patents. It's not too hard to add SMS fallback into a messaging service on Android. There's a prominent one that already exists on Android: Signal! If you message somebody who has Signal, it sends a Signal encrypted message. If that person doesn't have Signal, it falls back to SMS by default. Google could easily make a messaging app that does something similar to that, but they don't want to do that. Maybe it's because it's not profitable, or maybe it's something else. But, in any case, they could do it. They're just choosing not to. Suicide_Note Maybe Google should buy Signal, and put them in charge of Google's messaging platform for Android? Knowledgeborn Allah 😂 As nice as that would be, Google would never go in the direction of Signal (or even Apple), making messages end-to-end encrypted by default, because that would prevent them from getting more information about their users. They need as much information as possible. They couldn't get anything like that from something like Signal or iMessage... Even though, ironically, WhatsApp also encrypts their messages end-to-end, and they're owned by Facebook. ¯_(ツ)_/¯ bekifft Please God no. Leave Signal alone. Craig Nelson In his defense WhatsApp is hugely popular and doesn't have SMS but I agree with you pretty much Knowledgeborn Allah Agreed... Plus, of course, it's the dedicated default standard. Nobody with an iOS device needs to download iMessage. That helps out a lot too. dcdttu Samsung just made Google Play Music its phone's default music player. Gmail is a required app if you want Android with Google Play Services. I guarantee you that Google, if they wanted, could force a messaging standard on Android. Even if they couldn't force it, they surely could have created one good enough that they wouldn't have had to force it - but it may be too late for that. Knowledgeborn Allah Yeah, I think it's too late for them to try to force a messaging app that people would actually use, lol. Now, they could force their hardware partners to put their proprietary messenger into their dedicated Android services package, like how they did with Hangouts. I heard they're halfway trying to do that with Allo, but we'll see how that holds up. dcdttu Yea, that ship has sailed. Makes you wonder how the author thinks all these barely-used apps are going to be profitable when everyone is using iMessage and WhatsApp instead. Knowledgeborn Allah Exactly... 😂 DragoCubed Yeah. By doing that they can at least enforce that app on devices running that version of Android and higher. That would be the best solution but the thing is that it can't work on iPhones. I've said it before but it seems that Google doesn't want to put any Android exclusives. Google just won't ever do it, even though it would solve the messaging problem. And yeah, it is way too late. Sir_Brizz Android Messages isn't on everything, either, if we're going that direction. Hangouts was a required app so something like Allo that is actually competitive could be as well. Even if it's not, if Google had an app they could recommend that was competitive with iMessage, that would set the right tone for the platform. The fact that you have to go to third parties whose apps aren't even in the same ballpark to get such a popular (in the US) feature says a lot about the tone of Android. Knowledgeborn Allah I agree, but I think people have the wrong idea about iMessage. One of the best things about iMessage is the fact that it's the default messaging platform. Google needs a good messaging app, but they also need it to be the default messaging app on Android. At this point, I don't think that's ever going to happen. Sir_Brizz I don't disagree, but I do think at this point they just need something they can talk about and recommend that is actually competitive and it would at least help improve the platform's image. Knowledgeborn Allah Agreed. abc All Android users have access to Chrome and every other Google app. Nothing is stopping Google from having a pre-installed messaging app along with their other pre-installed apps. Certainly, more useful than a G+ app that barely anyone uses. Ryan You dont really understand what you are talking about and if you're even remotely correct, Google doesnt understand selling products at all. Messaging is part of a platform. You don't have to make money directly off of messaging. Hell, you can lose money on it directly and still have it contribute to success. Its a loss leader, something you intentionally dont make money off of but it makes you more appealing to customers (and you're wrong on the vendors being the real customers) so you have their focus when you do sell them something that is profitable. Having a better platform means more people want to use it, more peoples data can be sold, more people will buy stuff on Google Play, etc. And that isnt the vendors, its US. The vendors only care if WE will buy their phone, and making Android more appealing means more people will buy their phone than the competing platform (IOS). Josh Brown How do the make money off of Google Photos? How do they make money off of Google Translate? It makes Google's Android attractive to use so that people will use their services. Messaging is a huge part of it. If they are not careful someone will sink money into services and use AOSP to rival Google. Google could be the next Microsoft if they don't stop wasting time and money. ddevito No way, I totally disagree. All these messaging apps make it confusing to the average Android user. When they see their friends and coworkers use iMessage on iPhones and how much SIMPLER it is because it's all in one app, people will use that (among other reasons) to dump Android and get an iPhone. perfectalpha David...you are correct in what you're saying, but Google is really taking a beating in areas that are going to increasingly become important over the next few years. We rave about Google Assistant, but Amazon Alexa is the one getting the play with 3rd party products. You saw it at CES, you see it with smartphones from Huawei, and I even saw it in my email with the Ecobee 4 (cause I'm all bout the smart home as well). Samsung is doubling down on Bixby. Those are the two largest Android smartphone OEMs. That isn't good. For all the great work Google does, they're increasingly shutting themselves out of areas that will prove important in the future. Google relies on services and if consumers are choosing other platforms, it has the chance to negatively impact their existing platforms. Case in example...Facebook has messaging on lockdown. The more users on that platform, the more that will look at Facebook videos and Facebook Live for entertainment vs YouTube. There are people in powerful places anticipating messaging apps being the browsers of the future. It isn't about having a platform out there, as Google+ has shown, you need to have legitimate mindshare with your platform. I personally believe they're past the point of no return when it comes to messaging. They're like Microsoft with Windows Phone...rebooting and hoping they strike gold (they won't). Google is doing well (every tech company is to be honest that doesn't make hardware minus Apple), but they need to be relentless about user experience first and foremost. Saying it is only about money is a bad strategy, especially when Facebook will be kicking their ass with 2 messaging platforms sporting over a billion users a piece. h4rr4r Such a shift among older tech companies is what left a place for Google to exist. The same will happen again. Raymond Hawkins Isn't Android itself quite profitable though? Not just selling to device manufacturers but the portion of every play store purchase that they get? HSidhu David is Google staff. lol netizen Of course It is, what else is something else for from G? :-) George Yup, its just as we suspected... it's definitely about monetizing those stickers... dash It's not so much about money as it is Google not wanting to get sued EU regulators if you ask me they're already under scrutiny in the EU for having a mobile Monopoly if they baked a standard messenger into Android the way iOS has imessage the EU would be all over them for taking money away from carriers and other apps Rod Why doesn't Apple get sued as well? dash Apples market share is much smaller in comparison and they are a closed system only apple makes iphones. Google would be seen as forcing other oems to use it's messaging system Rod Time for Google to pull an Apple! Yay jak_341 I went to WhatsApp. Haven't looked back. Antony Me too this is what this whole Google messaging mess made me do .. TechGuy22 I can't wait for them to unveil a new one at I/0 K77bkny lol and then it'll be discontinued for something else 3 month's later... Mace Moneta The new app is called "G'Day" and it's essentially the same as Allo, but adds sparkle effects to messages. Unfortunately, Allo's code could not be updated to include sparkle effects; a complete rewrite was required, hence the new app. The problem that Google has at this point is that some people would have read that and believed it. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ And the text is upside down in this hemisphere. K77bkny and backwards like everything else they do... Gladysrcrosby Managing director of Google!, is explaining to users to start off "Work at home" method, that People have been doing for about one year now. These days alone, I generated close to $36,000 until now with no more than my home computer as well as some spare time, despite that i have a fulltime 9 to 5 job.

TechGuy22 nay, they are going to have a go at snapchat lol they tried to copy IMessage, Whatsapp. now only Snapchat and Instagram is left. Adrien Aubel I'm not aware of any new effort from Google, but I'd bet like you on a Snapchat style if there was any new app popping up at I/O this year. Hey G Day could even be their name for it :D Rod The saddest part, is that I can imagine they pushing Instagram-like stuff into Photos. thespacecowboy No. It's called 'Yo'. Oh. Wait. chris tayah that was good lol BoFiS Or just keep using Hangouts, since that allows me to chat across devices and on computers resuming the same conversations everywhere, shame about SMS going away, but that's what Handcent is for ;-) Andrew Well https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/19cc43bc3b8c8f3f63a34987e2e80e342783e665185aa0e887382395eb564e73.jpg bdbplatano That's alotta words Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ This is why I don't trust Google's ad block strategy. I don't see how they can resist the temptation to use the blocking algorithm to drive more people to use adsense, doubleclick, or any other means of advertising that Google can monetize. Jesse Corbett If I may propose a theory, Google knows that for ads which are otherwise equal in quality, their ability to serve personalized ads is without a doubt the best, this is likely less about improving user experience and more about creating a level playing ground, where other companies can't use cheap tactics like bad ads to get the upper hand. No need to prefer their own ads, because when all ads are equal, Google will win every time. b_boogey_xl I like Allo. Arthur Dent Al-lol b_boogey_xl Oh, and Duo is NOT a messaging app. Please stop grouping it in when you need to make the lame point of the amount of messaging apps that are available from Google. Antony What do you like allo for ? Does it offer anything different from an app with much bigger user base like WhatsApp ? Really curious to know b_boogey_xl I use Allo to talk to friends and family, whom we've all switched from Hangouts. Honestly, I don't need the entire world on the app so long as the people I talk to the most are on it. I'm in the US so WhatsApp isn't that big over here. I also do enjoy using all the little features that it offers, like shout and whisper, Assistant in conversations is actually useful, not for everything but useful and I'm sure Google will have more tricks up their sleeve for it. Allo the app isn't a bad messenger at all, by far. It's light weight, fast and runs really well. I find that people who complain about All aren't really talking about the experience of using the app but more about having to download a new service and convince others to use it (hence no one is using it jokes 🙄) but to me, you're either part of the solution or apart of the problem when it comes to who uses it. Funny thing is, if we all decided to use it, there wouldn't be a problem. 7-down I like Meelo more. Google's new messaging app in beta testing right now. b_boogey_xl … 🙄 abc At least there's one of you. b_boogey_xl HAHAHAHAHA!!!! Oh man!! That was so funny. You are hilarious!!! It's so funny and clever!!! I totally get it. It's like you're trying to imply that Allo isn't popular so I must be the only one using the app!! Wow! Genius!! https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/05459ebf579e28adaea54382e65d7597fa0c10c35ea549fbe30b5a8e142a42aa.gif Shane Redman "Unfortunately for Allo, not having SMS fallback in North America all but ensures it cannot be successful." Is this not the incentive that they need to get more users on Allo? Sure, it doesn't bring in anything from messages, but it DOES bring in more users! Which have to be minimal right now (even though I think Allo is an awesome messenger, no one I know uses it beyond 2 friends). Sir_Brizz I'm the same. I actually like Allo but almost nobody I know uses it for several reasons. Marty That's probably the case with Chrome too, why Google won't ever improve it. Ryu "I have a simple rule in life—if something does not seem make sense, look for the money." Is the typo in the first sentence intentional because it has money in it? If so, clever. If not, you are missing a "to" before make. :P Anyhow, good article. David Ruddock Fixed, I may have messed that up. mark555055d yep, this is no longer yesterday's Google. "Don't be evil need" not apply. Antony Yep . Since the created alphabet that model seems to have changed 😭 Charles This is so very very true, it started with The death of Nexus, then Pixel pricing, and continues today in the smallest of changes such as moving your Google Home shopping list from the more convenient Keep to the lagging Google Express. There's a huge push at Google campus right now for profitability over consumer appeasement and sadly enough it is starting to show through in the end results more and more frequently... Antony Totally agree with you .. this is one of the main reasons why I am considering switching to iPhones ddevito Same here. I just switched full-time to my iPhone 6s (from OnePlus 3) and I don't miss Android yet. The apps are WAY better, the OS is way more polished and simpler, and the whole device is frankly just more reliable. I use my OP3 less and less everyday. Google is sinking their own ship Sir_Brizz I don't really get the "iOS is simpler" POV. I find it harder to do just about anything on iOS. Having a consistent and friendly messaging solution is one thing, but has nothing to do with the OS really. ddevito I find Android way more powerful, flexible and capable. But on it may do fewer things than Android, but it does (most) of them better. Notifications are still rather rubbish, and sharing data between apps still isn't there yet. But everything else is great. 3D touch is so amazing, I wish more apps used it properly. Sir_Brizz I've had to use iPhones for work in the past but I can count on one hand the number of times I even remembered that 3D Touch was a thing. My wife exclusively uses an iPhone 7+ and she doesn't even know what 3D Touch is. It's a gimmicky feature that sounds good in a presentation but really doesn't end up being used much. I'm not arguing that iOS doesn't have some advantages over Android. I would rate the platform higher in some key areas. However, if notifications are an important facet of your device, I don't see how you can rely on iOS. They really are that bad in comparison. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I know several people with iPhones. I've never seen them use 3D Touch or Siri. Sir_Brizz I feel the same. I've showed my wife 3D Touch a few times on her 7+. She thought it was interesting at the times, but I asked her about it today and she said "What is that?" ddevito Just because most people don't know it exists doesn't make it not useful. I agree most people don't know what it is, then again most people who have iPhones don't care about tech at all really, they just want to text and post to Facebag. ddevito 3D Touch isn't gimmicky at all, I'd argue every smartphone should have it. Hell Android copied it. It's very useful to get something direct out of an app. Android had app shortcuts which were essentially the same thing but it never caught on. Notifications aren't the worst, rich notifications are actually really powerful, but really they just need to be simply grouped in iOS and it'll be much better. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I'd argue that it's not intuitive, and not easy to use. You have to get used to the pressure that gets the result. The S Pen hover for the Note is much more intuitive because it just happens. You don't have to think about it. That's one of the main reasons I'd miss the S Pen if I get an iPhone. The other is that the S Pen makes selecting text incredibly easy. Much easier than using your finger. ddevito I totally disagree - just push down with your finger, it's quite easy. Once you use it a few times on a few apps you know how to do it. My wife borrowed my iPhone for a few days and she even got used to it and said she wished her 6P had something similar (which it does, but the context is way different). I do agree with copying and pasting text. I like Android's way better, it's faster. On iOS it takes a while, quite annoying. Using the Google Keyboard takes even longer. Sir_Brizz App shortcuts and 3D Touch aren't anything alike really. In one scenario they kind of offer similar results. App shortcuts never caught on because there is a fundamental problem with the concept and that is lack of intuitiveness. The current implementation has the same problem. However, I think Google just realized it was pointless to remove just because most people won't ever use it. And you can now add app shortcuts directly to your home screen which actually increases the usability in the end. Anyway, 3D Touch is still a gimmick designed for a presentation. And the notifications are abysmal on iOS. I'm not being overly critical about it, it really is just that much worse on iOS than Android. I literally rely on receiving and responding to my notifications. I would constantly miss them on iOS. ddevito How is getting a direct result, or a specific screen within an app (or others) gimmicky? It provides a faster way to get the data you want, then get out. So since you're such an expert it seems, besides not being able to respond directly to notifications, and not being grouped, what else makes iOS notifications so "abysmal"? I don't disagree that Android's are better, I'm just generally curious on why you think this is so. I'm looking forward to your OBjective answer ;-) Sir_Brizz The specific capability you are talking about may or may not be gimmicky. The 3D Touch functionally is a gimmick, though. It's entire purpose is to present well. The majority of iOS problems with notifications are just discoverability. But that by itself is a big enough problem that it really drops it down that far. Most people I know with iPhones have a tendency to just completely miss notifications of texts and messages if they don't see and respond to them right away. I understand because I had the exact same problem with my iPhone. ddevito I totally agree without having them stay persistent you can totally miss them. Android's notification tray is very underrated and underappreciated Sir_Brizz Yeah, that's all I was saying. Sorry for the confusion :) ddevito Thanks mate. Trust me I'm a huge Android fan, rocking a OnePlus 3 right now also. I prefer Android, just hope this hardware holds up. Sir_Brizz I really hope the Pixel 2 is actually no compromises. ddevito You and me both. ddevito What's important to me is getting updates when they're released, having good and consistent battery life, having good customer support if I need it, having a good and consistent camera, and enjoying great apps. Sure Android can give me most of that, but never all of any of them, I love the OS and ecosystem but the hardware is lacking. I'm not a Samsung fan so I feel I don't have any great high end options. And the Pixel isn't proven yet, it needs to show massive improvement for the second iteration. Is the iPhone perfect? Hell no, it's a toy, it's restrictive and dumbed down in lots of ways. But the damn thing just works, every time. Sir_Brizz Honestly, most of that is regularly subjective. If you like the iPhone, that's great. But it's not an all around improvement from Android, it's trading one set of compromises for another set. ddevito Oh I agree, I'm not saying the iPhone is the smartphone I've been waiting for all these years. I'm just saying my priorities have shifted, I expected Android to catch up in a lot of areas. It has for most of them, but I feel personally it still needs a alot of revamping for the most basic of things, like the ones I mentioned. Rod Faulty battery? ddevito I hope not. I've had it since October and it's been great, but ever since upgrading to Nougat battery life has gone South. I'm hoping OnePlus can fix it. Rod What caused such drain, then? ddevito No idea, I don't see too many wakelocks so the only culprit left is Android OS - so probably Oxygen OS ersouza It's an interesting theory, but there's no real concrete evidence here that the approach is at all profitable. And if this approach is somehow a profitable one, why aren't other companies diversifying their messaging apps like Google has? David Ruddock No one is saying the approach is profitable. That's a very different question. The issue is that apps like Allo and Android Messages RCS *can* have profitable business models. There's no guarantee any of it will work. ersouza But you're saying "follow the money" while showing no concrete proof that this is a profitable approach. It kind of needs to do that. There's been more than ample time to determine one way or the other, giving how long they've been messing with at least 2-3 different messaging services at a time. newtonfb That was one of the best articles on AP in a long time. Finally, a well fact based article arguably the most controversial aspects of Android. Morten Ulv People always ask "WHY?", but never stop to think on that question before going on a rant of how stupid Google is and how they don't understand what is so obvious to everyone else. Why didn't Google just focus on Hangouts? The ability to advertise on the service may have been a factor, but I'm not convinced that this has ever been a driving factor for Google. "Build a great service (that people want to use) and the money will come" has always been their motto. Hangouts is a niche product with little chance to capture significant market share. There are currently 3 ways to make a successful messaging app: 1. Piggyback on a social network like Messenger. And that is what Google tried with G+. 2. Bundle it on the users of an OS like iMessage, but Google can't force Hangouts on users like Apple can. 3. Spread through the use of phone numbers. And since this is the only currently known option left, Google had to create a new app to ever have the chance to capture the market. But what chance do they have in a saturated market? At the end of the day, what we enthusiasts think, matter little to the strategy Google has to go for. It may bother our OCD that Google has multiple apps, but there is no better way to succeed, unless you have a time machine. Christopher Bement They can totally monetize Hangouts. Gmail saves a chat log, they already scan your Gmail for ad service and Google now information. Morten Ulv I'm inclined to agree. The problem with Hangouts was it's low growth potential. makapav Everything has a low growth potential if you don't have a vision and you throw idiotic developers at it. makapav Google already has everyone's email address in your contact address book. That should have been enough to integrate your communication with everyone else on your contact list without the need for having the invite b******* that currently exists and hangouts. This would have been just like What's App. Every Android phone is activated with a Gmail account. Link that to a phone number and your set from all three points. Morten Ulv Hm? Whatsapp uses phone numbers, just like Allo. And the problem isn't getting people's contacts, its to get people to use the app. Rod The own name is questionable. makapav Google didn't care and thought they could take the same lazy half baked approach with Allo as Hangouts. Even today Hangouts has 10% feature parity with mainstream competitors while Allo has 5%. They took one year to develop features into Hangouts. You can't capture market with poor app discoverability, immature product and no user engagement of feedback. The failure of Hangouts is not happenstance or competition, it is Google's laziness and poor product management. UtopiaNH Hangouts was under the google + team which lost direction, leadership and backing when Google+ became a wide joke and leadership backed away from the plan and the main architect of it left the company. It only recently got moved internally to the Gapps team as things got restructured internally. Rod Allo is even worse. They must not think about how the app name sounds in other languages. Telegram, for example, sounds OK in other languages as well. It's straightforward. abc Yeah, except nobody is using their messaging apps, so maybe they should have listened to what people were saying. So many people said they had no reason to switch from an app that all their contacts use to an app that no one uses. Until Google has an answer to that question, they are wasting their own time. Morten Ulv Capturing huge market shares with any social app is extremely hard to do. Sure you can win over us geeks with the right features, but that doesn't convince the market at large. You just have to have the right app at the right time and get lucky. No successful messaging app started with a core of geeks (not that it would hinder success, it's just not needed). They may fail, but how would you know that without trying? You don't. makapav Saw your other responses. You are borderline a fanboy or trolling. Google dropped the ball and didn't even give Hangouts a chance. They are fully to blame. Morten Ulv Hangouts didn't live up to it's potential, but it is unlikely that it could have gained a lot of traction among regular people. As you, I would have loved it if they just made one great app for us, and not giving a fuck if they had a billion users or not. Here I was only offering explanations as to why, just as the article did. I may very well be a fanboy, while you take the role of armchair geniusbesserwisser. Fresh360 I thought I was about to read a satirical rant about greed but was pleasantly surprised that this article is so well written and informative. I really thought Google had it all wrong but maybe, just maybe they are doing it all right (financially). dcdttu Except, you know, if Google wanted to really profit from messaging, they'd create something that drove people toward their messaging products, not away. I highly doubt their current approach profits at all with such low adoption rates. They'd have been better off with one solid app. MikeOxlong That's because there was no David Rudduck involvement. Think about it... 4Ui812 Make it now break it .... remake it now break it. That seems to be Google's strategy. Antony The only thing that this strategy from Google made me realize is that Google is no longer a company that wants to change the world it is just yet another company that seeks revenue and the only thing I did here is totally neglect any messaging or social app by Google. and just switch to someone who is actually passionate about connecting people which is Facebook's WhatsApp and a small company like telegram and one day maybe even switch to iOS . Their business model is clearer pay for what you get while Android is too complicated . Steve Jobs was right Ailín Ó’S This is why I just use WhatsApp. It has all my friends/family on it and all the features I want. No need to bother with Google and their ridiculous policy of "let's have a million messaging apps" Andrew Whatsapp would be a solid 9/10 for me if they let me use the system emoji, I get that it makes it universal but I like my yellow blobs Ailín Ó’S Yeah I agree, I get that WhatsApp do it for uniformity but it's annoying to see different emoji on Facebook Messenger and Hangouts (for example), but WhatsApp is by far the king of messaging in Europe so ho hum! Rod What? Whatsapp is horrid. Telegram stomps on it. Sir_Brizz That's ok, but you are dealing with Facebook and their let's have a million ways to message people. I feel like WhatsApp still has a huge question mark over it for the foreseeable future. Who knows what will happen when Facebook finally decides to try to make back their 12 billion dollars. Cakefish Thank Gaben that Valve isn't a public traded company. Sam Del Valle Google has a messaging addiction https://media.giphy.com/media/l4Ki2obCyAQS5WhFe/giphy.gif Jose Romero I gave up on Allo and Hangouts. I also ported my Google Voice number into T-mobile. All I use now is Android Messages and I don't miss the others at all. Suicide_Note Messages is one of their best apps, for sure. Adonis K. I don't even use Messages anymore switched it to Facebook's Messenger. freshprince_87 Facebook messenger is buggy and garbage. Your better off using Whatsapp Adonis K. First of Android Messages is an SMS app. I said I use Messenger as an alternative to Messages which means I'm using Messenger to send and recieve SMS. How on earth will Whatsapp help me with that? It's completely offtopic freshprince_87 No it isn't off topic. Most people don't Facebook messenger for SMS. They most likely use their default SMS app on their phone. And since you said you use Facebook messenger, I assumed you used it for instant messaging. And if that was the case, whatsapp is the better option in most cases. The new iMessage for Android called invi is something you should use instead of Facebook messenger. It does both IM and SMS Ryan It seems more simple than all of this, they a disjointed and unorganized organization. They want to change things but nobody is actually controlling the monkeys at the typewriters. Messaging is a critical part of the PLATFORM. The platform that secures Google's space in mobile search, music, etc. They dont monetize messaging or Android, the monetize selling you the crap through it AND selling your information. So there is money to be made in losing money developing messaging. Its used everywhere and its called a "loss leader." Its something you dont expect to make money on to get people in the doors to buy something you do make money on. Its not as simple as "make money or be taken out back to be shot." You dont understand business well enough. Law One of the biggest flaws people bring up when they talk about Android is, "oh, it seems so hard to use" I don't think it is but sometimes, most times, consumers want a unified type of service across the board that is recognizable. ddevito Let's compare Apples to Apples shall we? (I use an iPhone 6s and OnePlus 3 daily) Despite this mess, Allo whips iMessage. The Google bot, gif search, and easier (and way more flexible) file share makes iMessage look outdated and slow. All iMessage is good for is for SMS, sending confetti and balloons. Jordan L I think Allo works great too, me and about 5 other people I chat with use it. web client and chat back up will make it even better. Suicide_Note I like Allo a lot, but use it only with my wife, since it lacks SMS fallback. For all of my other contacts i just use Google Messages. I don't want to ask people to install a particular app just to be able to message them. If Google incorporated SMS fallback into Allo, it'd be the only messaging app i need/use. Sir_Brizz Same, but it does really need chat history backup and a web client and maybe integration into Fi/Voice for me. Jordan L I've always said this: google just needs to make Allo enrollment mandatory on ALL android devices. solved. I guess this can't happen. iMessage enrollment is automatic when you setup a new iphone, so EVERYONE iphone user is enrolled! most people with phones are REALLY bad at tech. they can barely install/setup apps. BUT they sure as hell will go though the initial phone setup. this is where you have to put the enrollment. Adrien Aubel But then you still couldn't reach all your iPhone friends right? Allo won't support SMS :( Jordan L But a default enrollment/install of Allo would lead to 1+ billion installs. At that point iPhone people might actually install Allo.... Ahhhhh but I just contradicted myself. Most iPhone users don't like installing chat apps. Hmmm.... Then we do need RCS or SMS. Adrien Aubel Hehe, basically Btw, most iPhone users don't like installing chat apps because they have one that works great for them out of the box, called Messages, doing almost everything they'd want to and letting them reach *any* friend. Which is what we're trying to build for Android at invi :) Rod Monopoly. Grey Look at Hangouts Chat - the new app. Look at how it integrates with all of Google's other offerings. THAT is a way to generate revenue. THAT is the power of a good messaging app. If Hangouts Chat features were integrated into regular Hangouts, you'd see an app everyone wanted to use. And guess what, Hangouts already supports stickers. It's not hard. Don't make excuses. Google is clueless, not trying to "drive their bottom line". ddevito While I generally agree with this article, this is obvious - if you're going down this route, then why not just mention that Android in general is a simpler, better and most effective way to generate more ad revenue for Google? This messaging mess isn't a way to make money, it's a clear sign of lack of leadership and product vision. mickeyB88 Its either nostalgia or naivety, but this doesn't surprise me. I've been continually growing more cynical of products over the years, and it just like you said. When it doesn't make sense to/for a consumer, follow the money. It seems as if there was a "back in the day" of technology where all anyone made was something that improved over a previous iteration, but it's always the money, whether they generate a faithful install base and change later or just keep that base by slowly changing so the shock doesn't cause mass exodus. Any product that starts out as genuinely useful either continues to be so, but loses money because they're not "innovating", or it changes to the detriment of the user because it's losing money. This can apply to pretty much any product marketed, whether it be games (f2p especially) or a product with apps that are "free" to use. We take all the data collection that Google does for granted because they deliver useful products, but then you have situations where they can't stop making new apps and refuse to market them properly, or don't seem to try to get new users at all. Then the app ends up like Allo, with a huge initial install number then quickly dying off. This bullshit is exactly what's pushing me to lean towards an iPhone, but I know eventually that bubble will burst (if it isn't already) and we're left with two platforms that don't seem to be very consumer-friendly. Bill Didn't Google try to buy WhatsApp for a lot of money? Sir_Brizz Rumor has it. Luxferro be glad they didn't, as they likely would have ruined it Sir_Brizz Don't get too excited. Rod As if it wasn't bad enough already. Lol Luxferro I have never used it. but considering how popular it is worldwide, they did something right. The same can't be said for anything Google has made. The only reason their messaging apps have 1/2 the stats they do is they pre-installed them at one point in time, and probably count app updates as install #'s. Rod It came out when there was barely any competition, and SMS was expensive in developing countries. People loved the idea of messaging "for free". That's why it sticked. But, as a service, Whatsapp sucks. The backup sucks, the in-built gallery sucks, the database code sucks.... SunnyStroker Always believed that a prerequisite for employment at Google was you must have ADD, (attention deficit disorder). They simply cannot complete anything stable without moving onto something else. Google; Always Half-Baked, Always in Beta johdaxx You figure their bill paying for an SMPP connector isn't cheap either...someone's got to pay the tremendously exorbitant prices for the SMSs, even if you're buying them wholesale. Kevin Davis The screenshot at the end of the article says it all for me. Not no, but HELL NO. 1/2 a dozen apps to communicate effectively. GTFOH. perfectalpha Hands down one of the best articles written that clearly illustrates why silly decisions get made and PERHAPS provides them with insights why their place of employment makes silly decisions. Here's the deal, everything you posted above is EXACTLY why Google cannot build a successful messaging app. The whole purpose of a communications app is to help people communicate. If Google is more concerned about getting data from the content, it is an automatic failure because they're putting internal interests ahead of user experience. We have heard time and time again what folks want, yet Google continues to fail on delivering that. Again, everybody posting knows what is common sense, but it is what it is. Margaritas Ante Porcos IMO the only thing Google achieved by now is that we all ignore Google messaging solutions in favour of Whatsapp. Google lost millions of users in that regard. If Google sees money in losing apps users than be it. Jokes aside, Google has not only lost millions of specific apps users but also reputation. That will be hard to rebuild. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2ca30070f6fabc67579625a0df20395e6b673d828a835fe66eaf0b630f8d66a7.jpg F4LL0U7 Very well written article -- I bet you're 100% right. I'm sticking with Hangouts. Since I use my Google Voice number for everything, my texts and voicemail still go through that app, as well as my Hangouts obviously. I was forced to install the Android Messenger, but basically only for SMS updates from my carrier. Brett Linking Google's messenger mess to a fiduciary duty is quite a reach. Shareholder derivative suits are a threat for any public company, but this is a vast overstatement of Google's Board's obligations. The Business Judgment Rule gives the Board wide latitude to make decisions that it thinks are in the best interests of the company (whether immediately leading to a profit or not). And Google/Alphabet has shown time and time again that it will allow experimentation to occur -- even at a great loss -- for years with only the potential for a payout far down the road. See driverless cars, Glass, Chrome etc.which don't directly make a single penny. Even these *vastly more expensive* projects don't lead to shareholder derivative suits. And investors are warned in the 10K that: "The idea of trying new things is reflected in some of our new, ambitious projects both within Google and Other Bets. Everything might not fit into a neat little box. We believe that is exactly how to stay relevant. Many companies get comfortable doing what they have always done, making only incremental changes. This incrementalism leads to irrelevance over time, especially in technology, where change tends to be revolutionary, not evolutionary. People thought we were crazy when we acquired YouTube and Android, and when we launched Chrome. But as those efforts have matured into major platforms for digital video and mobile devices, and a safer, popular browser, respectively, we continue to look towards the future and continue to invest for the long-term. We won't become complacent, relying solely on small tweaks as the years wear on. As we said in the 2004 Founders' IPO Letter, we will not shy away from high-risk, high-reward projects that we believe in because they are the key to our long-term success. We won't stop asking "What if?" and then working hard to find the answer. See https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1288776/000165204416000012/goog10-k2015.htm Google may have decided each of its projects needs to be more self-sustaining, but that's a typical business decision and has nothing to do with a fiduciary duty. Contrary to what's presented here, Google's Board does not have an "obligated by law to generate shareholder value through regularly increasing profitability." If that were the case, every public company not consistently increasing profits would be in breach of the duty. That's simply not the case. The decision may be part of a realization that Google's traditional ad business cannot print money forever (and certainly not at an ever-increasing pace). And it may even be fair to cite that as a reason for the messaging strategy. But there are all sorts of motivations, turf wars, and simple bad decision making which are just as likely to be the real reason. Sir_Brizz This is very much right on. I think Occam's Razor does apply a bit here: the simplest explanation is simply that Google doesn't have (or at least hasn't had) a clear vision of their messaging strategy and split themselves in too many directions a few years ago when they bought Jibe. Essentially, bad decision making over the past 2-3 years if not as far back as when Hangouts was announced. IMO part of the issue is that Hangouts started getting feature bloat, and adding things like chat bots to it was probably not possible, or at least caused enough problems that they didn't want to. Hangouts Chat looks like a fundamental rewrite probably as was Allo. These represent the future concerns of a Google messaging strategy. Expect chat bots to make up a major part of that over the next couple of years. My personal frustration is simply the fact that Google doesn't have one messaging platform that is competitive with one single competing messaging platform. All of their solutions together aren't, either. Monetarily it doesn't make sense for them to live so far behind the curve on something that has been increasingly becoming a fundamental function of the markets they are trying to survive within. t_newt It is not just about money--it is also about people. I get the feeling all the drama we hear rumors about, and the result of people leaving at the top of the company, has created a vacuum of leadership, and powerful people move quickly to fill that vacuum. Innovative companies that start letting their accountants, lawyers, or even HR start running the company quickly lose their innovation, and if there is effective, innovative competition, they quickly lose their marketshare. The reason Google has a lot of customers (or, more accurately, lots of people using their products that they can sell to advertisers), is that Android provides a useful ecosystem. If they lose track of that, they will lose people and will lose advertisers. Saying that messaging has to be profitable by itself is like a car company saying that the car trunk has to be profitable. A CFO at GM can tell the trunk engineer "show me how this is making us money or take it out of the design!" I like Android products. They are useful in organizing my life. But if Google loses track of that, I will (reluctantly) switch to an iPhone. A CFO doesn't think that way, which is why the CFO should be an advisor, not a leader. I hope Google doesn't become the next MySpace. headpiece747 This article was making me think of something that I hope Android Police would write about. What is the best messaging app with sms? I have been a die hard Hangout user since I have been on Android and never used nothing else. Would like a comparison of each. I am stuck using sms because everyone at work is on different platforms (ios, android and flip phone no joke) and they won't all go to one chat app like whatsapp or allo even though I haven't used either one. Suicide_Note I use Google Messages since it allows me to send/receive from anyone, whether they are on Android/iOS/Windows, or using a smart/dumb phone. Adrien Aubel Please try out invi (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi). It's an app that we're making, that is quite new and trying to solve specifically the problem you're talking about, transparently bringing IM when both people have the app. Another great option is Textra, more customization (we're about to ship significant changes though), although it doesn't support IM and even though they initially talked about supporting RCS I believe they gave up. We're actively talking with both Google and Samsung to be on top of it. Would love to get your feedback! Maybe try both? MeCampbell30 There is a lot wrong with this article and a few questionable journalism decisions. "In order to get a business case approved by a CFO like Ms. Porat, little else matters but the bottom line." Even in an editorial it's generally best to avoid assertions that could be considered borderline defamatory unless you have evidence or facts to support it. Perhaps the author does, but it isn't made clear in the body of the article. I also have to say the explanation about the law on fiduciary duties, shareholder derivative actions (lawsuits on behalf of the corporation), and the actual practice of Wall Street law firms is not accurate. I wrote more on reddit but an editor should go back and double check the sourcing on those statements. Also, typically, at least with organizations I'm familiar with, it's the job of a project manager to submit a proposal to the project management office (PMO) to get funding approval for big changes or more developer time. For even larger changes, it goes to an executive committee. The CFO is typically part of that committee (sometimes depending on expertise) but the day to day of the CFO is usually regulatory (complying with SEC, CFTC, import, ect. regulations and managing all of alphabets various accounts globally). At a company like Google it would be staffed by hundreds of people all around the world. As far as the logical thrust of the article, its not very consistent. RCS doesn't really provide a new income stream for Google. Nor does Googles noble effort to improve Android Messages. From a financial point of view, it would be more worthwhile to have a greater share of high spending users (attracted by a cohesive messaging system) than it would be to have more information on less spendy users (or more clickthroughs from those users). Brett Amen. I wrote a similar response before seeing yours: http://disq.us/p/1i1bpah Trevor Newman Not sure it was borderline defamatory. It was a simile describing the generalized thought process of generalized people hired to ensure the financial success of a company. I do appreciate your thoughtful explanation of the project funding approval process (not being facetious). I understand that many companies have a tiered approval process with dollar amount thresholds granting certain persons the authority to authorize funding. My statements were meant to infer that business cases generally require a financial upside to receive funding, whether that is by the PMO or the CFO. While I am not positive that Allo required approval of the CFO, that was not the point of the article. It was meant as an opinion piece, not a scholarly treatise on Google. Just wanted​ to remind people that Google is a company and that they are subject to the same pressures as any other business. John Marshall’s Ghost Just FYI, this obligated by law to generate shareholder value through regularly increasing profitability. is not true. Fiduciary duty does not require anyone to increase. It merely requires a company to not engage in fraud, self-dealing or other instances that basically amount to theft, embezzlement, etc. This is a misconception that has gone hand in hand with the maxim of "maximizing shareholder value." It's wrong and please stop perpetuating the myth. Profits are subject to business decisions and business decisions that do not result in profit are not actionable in court absent a finding of fraud, self-dealing, etc. Source: Corporate attorney Yu Ping Hu It's not just that fiduciary duty wouldn't require maximized or increased profitability; there IS NO FIDUCIARY DUTY of a corporation to its shareholders. https://www.nixonpeabody.com/en/ideas/articles/2017/03/13/massachusetts-high-court-rules-that-public-company-directors-owe-fiduciary-duty-to-corporation John Marshall’s Ghost There is a fiduciary duty because officers and employees can't self-deal. Also, you liked a case from MA. There are 50 states plus federal law. That means 51 sets of laws. In NY officers owe a fiduciary duty to shareholders. But that duty does not require the maximization of shareholder value. MeCampbell30 You're misreading that. First, that is not a uniform rule among all states. Alphabet is a Delaware corporation, not a Massachusetts one. Second, there is little practical difference. A corporation's officers have a fiduciary duty to the owners (either the shareholders outright or their representatives on the board of directors). This rule is mostly procedural in that it acts as a bar on cases that tend to have less merit. MeCampbell30 Also an attorney in finance. I wrote as much in my post. Brett Yup. See my similar response: http://disq.us/p/1i1bpah David Ruddock Thanks for the insight here. I've removed the section on fiduciary duty pending some more discussion of this internally. Appreciate everyone who pointed this out - we don't want to mislead anyone here, and a note has been placed in the relevant section. John Marshall’s Ghost I just have to comment that that was very responsible of you and commendable. Thank you for doing that. The whole "maximizing shareholder value" is required by law is a huge pet peeve of mine. Responses like this are why I trust AP. Jason Brown Given the more-more-more with less-less-less approach of modern news media, I'm astounded they have the time to monitor reader feedback. John Marshall’s Ghost It shows the quality of AP. Over the years, as an Android fan, I've whittled my Android news down to AP because of things exactly like this. Christopher Bement This is the biggest reason I read AP every day if my life. You guys have a fucking scary commitment to integrity and I love that. extesy You only have to look at Amazon for specific examples: zero profit for 15+ years, as decided by Jeff Bezos. Trevor Newman You are right, I misstated that it was a legal obligation. The black letter text defining fiduciary duty in Delaware state law, where Google is incorporated, does not list increasing profitability as a fiduciary duty owed by a corporation to its shareholders. However, like any statutory language, it possesses ambiguity and it is open to interpretation. Case law on the matter suggests that legal opinions are admittedly mixed. However, courts have interpreted the language of the fiduciary duty to include maximizing the economic value of the company, and by extension its shareholders. I based my intentionally hyperbolic statement on the basis on court opinions like the following written by Justice Chandler, formerly of the Delaware Court of Chancery: “Having chosen a for-profit corporate form, the craigslist directors are bound by the fiduciary duties and standards that accompany that form. Those standards include acting to promote the value of the corporation for the benefit of its stockholders. The "Inc." after the company name has to mean at least that. Thus, I cannot accept as valid for the purposes of implementing the Rights Plan a corporate policy that specifically, clearly, and admittedly seeks not to maximize the economic value of a for-profit Delaware corporation for the benefit of its stockholders—no matter whether those stockholders are individuals of modest means[106] or a corporate titan of online commerce. If Jim and Craig were the only stockholders affected by their decisions, then there would be no one to object. eBay, however, holds a significant stake in craigslist, and Jim and Craig's actions affect others besides themselves.” - Ebay Domestic Holdings, Inc. v. Newmark Civil Action No. 3705-CC. Court of Chancery of Delaware It was never my intention for this to be a legal opinion and I do appreciate you calling this out as it was also not my intention to mislead. I also appreciate David's swift action in removing that portion so as to also not perpetuate the misstatement. I will be sure to avoid this kind of “absolute” language when describing matters such as that. John Marshall’s Ghost Thank you for your response. This is the hallmark of professionalism. Typically, I wouldn't say anything but this is a) my wheelhouse and b) the whole "maximize shareholder value" is a pet peeve of mine because people think it's law when it's not and that has been the basis of 35+ years of failed economic policy (i.e., trickle down economics) and the justification for offshoring jobs. But, thank you again for the response. I thought your article was very well written and I hope this didn't come across as critical. I have done this to the NY Times, The Atlantic and various other organizations. Yours is the only article that has ever responded appropriately. Keep up the good work! 4Ui812 Sorry for your loss Cuba https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/7396d722df5e3e069a320bcb2bded5cf4f113d3dc4d757cf83ec05f4c0c39f4f.gif John That makes no sense whatsoever. Google for Android forced everyone to use Assistant. It could have done the same for Hangouts. Or at least offered it as an option without creating a bunch of separate products, losing Hangouts users, and losing the ability to monetize on the desktop. Moreover, SMS, while not ideal, can still be analyzed and monetized if it's used within a Google app. By informing users that not all features are available without carrier RCS support, it would have put pressure on carriers to add support. I.e., Hangouts user base could have been used to promote RCS. NoNotTellingYou Fantastic article. There really is a madness behind the madness. Anthony Maki Well written! I think this makes a very compelling case. What about Duo, though? Hard to make revenue from E2E-encrypted video/audio. David Ruddock Probably just to couple it up to Allo as a value-add if you ask me. I think the two are destined only to become more tightly integrated - if Allo succeeds. If Allo doesn't, then Duo doesn't have to die alongside it. Sir_Brizz The article essentially heads off the "value-add" argument, though. Why would they have one value-add app and not another? David Ruddock I won't pretend to have all the answers here, and I agree, it's not exactly clear why Duo exists. I was offering a potential explanation, though I admit it's not rock solid. Sir_Brizz I'll be honest, the article leaves me sitting here more confused than resolute about what is going on :) Adrien Aubel App developers will be able to integrate with Duo although it'll be more of a button that opens the app full screen. They almost did that with Hangouts but eventually didn't. Like you I could see this popping up in the dialer (although RCS is coming up), messages, and possibly any other Google app. Nick Felker I wonder how Google will respond to this article. It hits very hard into their reasoning and I imagine it will rustle a few engineers. Suicide_Note They won't say a peep. They never do. Adrien Aubel They do read it, at least their execs do. Although for them, whenever they write publicly online, it suggests that they write the opinion of Google as a company, even if it was probably their own, so they're not as free as you or me. But whenever I bring up something I saw online that wasn't officially public yet they're like "Where? Android Police? Probably." Lateef Alabi-Oki Projects now have to be approved by Porat? Hmmm... not too sure about that. From what I've heard the culture at Google is heavily anti-suit. I don't think Larry or Sergey will go for that. I know Porat is reigning back on moonshots, but I hear even she has to thread a thin line. And before you say, "Google is a publicly traded company...shareholders...blah blah blah." Google has been a publicly traded company for almost two decades, and Larry and Sergey have publicly told shareholders to go fuck themselves on several occasions. Google at a fundamentally level is a company that just doesn't care about shareholders. And while Porat may have been hired to try to instill financial discipline at the company, I don't think it will ever be at the expensive of the engineering ethos of Google. Messaging is a value-add to a platform. It's not a revenue generating endeavor. I doubt any monetization from messaging will shift the needle at Google. The messaging fiasco at Google is the result of a lack of vision, mismanagement, and bad leadership. Google just never took messaging seriously until it was too late, and Facebook started kicking its ass. Holla Is it still not common in US that everybody uses Whatsapp? Gabriel Macys Does it support SMS? Because I have zero interest in shilling apps on my friends and family unless it supports a cross-platform communication standard. Adrien Aubel We're building an iMessage-like app for Android that has 2 main goals: - Try to solve texting on Android (interestingly we're quite close to Google and meet with them regularly) - Bring your chats to life, try to get out of this 99% of messages being plain text. A bar suggests relevant media to enrich in 1 tap your message and our users send 12% of their messages with stickers, GIFs, or regular images. Which helps them make their messages more personal (although we're far from done, it'll get much smarter and more personal on a per-chat basis). After a few iterations over a couple of years we believe that we found a solution that will let us bring up our roadmap in a consistent structure. State-of-the-art technology that is although just the foundation for all the exciting stuff that we want to add in the coming months. If any enthusiast person wants to try it out, I'd love to receive brutally honest feedback: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi (it's US only for a couple more weeks though, sorry) AP won't really talk about us but to be fair they've heard about us from previous iterations as well, before we recoded the whole app with a different dev team etc. ipsofact I will download and test the state of the art technology. Although I have a few ideas myself. Lets connect and talk Adrien Aubel Sounds good :) I don't mind sharing with you part of our roadmap and exchange over it. We're in some way trying to bridge the gap between SMS and IM hassle-free, while bridging the gap between texting and Snapchat. ipsofact Sent you a linkedin request. Thanks Mike I'm very interested in this app and just downloaded it! Any chance of RCS being added to it in the future? Adrien Aubel We absolutely want that! We're actively talking to both Google and Samsung. Google is shy sharing their client and some technical details. It may not be stable or documented enough, but they eventually want to make it part of Android system APIs in a future version. Samsung is more interested actively contributing but we're still in early talks. Adrien Aubel We absolutely want to! Actively talking with the relevant people at Google and Samsung. Google is a bit shy sharing their client or technical details. It may be not as stable or documented as they want before sharing externally, and they eventually want to make it part of Android system APIs in a future version. Samsung is more actively collaborating but we're still in early talks. Can't wait to have another technology to transparently upgrade our users to when available :) Adrien Aubel We absolutely want to!

Adrien Aubel We wanted to focus on making a good product for the US before opening it to everybody. But we're revamping right now our support system and allowing a manual IM registration (Americans are automatically verified) to allow us to offer our features to other countries, and we're about to translate our materials and app, while giving multi-language to the Awesome Bar, to make it more relevant. We hope to be opened internationally within the next 3 weeks, will keep you informed! ipsofact LOL I was in a group messaging with 4 other iphones. 1 android. iMessage & RCS do not play well... Wesley Da’Nomad WhatsApp? How about some love for Signal? freshprince_87 What about loving the invi app instead. It's basically iMessage for Android Rod No messaging service can compete with Whatsapp's user base. Maybe WeChat. Isaac Fischer So, just so we're clear between this post and the last one: Trevor's official job function is to be the disgruntled malcontent who kinda likes Android but doesn't really like Google? He's "mansplaining" to us why we're sheeple? 🙃 Trevor Newman I actually love Google. I wish they made a single messaging app but I've come to terms with the fact that as long as WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger have billions of users between them and my family clings to Skype for video chatting...a single Google messenger would just be one more on the pile. People think I don't like Google but it's just not true. Mostly I'm just trying to understand them. Ben The problem is, Allo has catastrophically failed to collect any data because the Google nerds (essentially the entire readership of this site) were the only ones that downloaded the app. Given that, it's highly likely Allo is a massive net loss for Alphabet. Google's messaging strategy is simply not working from a financial or practical perspective while Facebook is flying ahead. This is might be a sign of a company trying to live up to its fiduciary duties, but failing at them on the messaging front. Christopher Robert Not a fan of Facebook Messenger, out of all of the ones on the market it violates privacy the worst of all of them. If you know anyone who works in digital advertising just ask them. Facebook sells your most private conversations as marketing meat to the highest bidder. Ben I honestly don't care too much but your comment is totally unrelated to my point. Christopher Robert Please explain to me why you "Honestly don't care" that Facebook reads all of your messages. I am not trying to be rude just curious how anyone could be okay with that. It's so out there to me that I have a hard time understanding how people are just okay with there private conversations being read by completely strangers. Ben Because my messages really aren't that secret and I know there's not a Facebook employee personally reading all my messages but rather they're just being used to target ads to me. Christopher Robert I'll bet you money there is a FB employee who reads messages. There is no way 100% of the messages are handled without any human oversight. Wolf0491 Yeah my buddy got the hangouts update other day removing his SMS and he told me he is uninstalling it and to use normal text now to get in touch because two apps is obnoxious. I don't blame him. Christopher Robert I was thinking this same thing, but was really hoping it was just a paranoid delusion. Is anyone actually okay with letting Google or anyone read all of their private chat messages. It is exactly for this reason that I can't get on board with Allo. If they end up shutting down Hangouts for non gapps users I will be switching over to Signal PRivate messaging along with most of my contacts. Google Give users what they want and they stay loyal and then you make money. Going after profits first just drives away users to find companies who are willing to listen to them. Hernán Guerra It seems you are under the assumption that Allo messages are not encrypted and Hangouts messages are, which is incorrect. RNTMPX Totally agree with your opinion! 2 Men-E If RCS would just be fully adopted by all US carriers, and designated OEMs...Google would see a massive increase in "Android Messages" usage. Sir_Brizz Probably not, because it's not the default SMS app on many OEM phones. Adrien Aubel I think they actually did a decent job on that end, shipping the app on more OEMs and carriers, they've spent so many endless meetings on this. I just hope that they'll let more easily app developers integrate with the technology to let their users benefit from a stronger RCS usage. kalehv And yet, even if that happened, most probably only be in North America. The world is beyond carrier-based-messaging now and won't look back IMO. bekifft Spot on assessment. For me it raises the question then, when does the damage being done outweigh the direct pursuit of the bottom line? No one is adopting their messaging platforms because they are too little, too late. At this point it's seeming more like outright hostility / incompetence from Google than anything. Spoonie The cost savings in not having to continuously update and run multiple apps by producing and maintaining one messaging app would probably be a very compelling business case; the increase in uptake and usage of the Allo app if SMS or RCS were add would also look very good on paper. I'm not sure this article is really on the money with the conclusions you have made. Po Lite Uninstall Hangouts and install use built in messenger how does that help google? I refuse to go anywhere with google messaging anymore cant trust it will be around next year. This is also making me look at Gmail and getting away from that. Its upsetting to be treated this way. None of these apps are free in the sense they get us to use the google eco system buy apps subscribe to google play music and google drive. but constantly ripping apps away that we like is a real drag. so H-Allo Spotify , Office 365 , I will stick with android and Messaging - Mail - and install every ad blocker / Firewall I can find. I will pay for apps not ads and by having me then constantly change my apps ( I have a whole bunch of friends that are going to hate me on May 22 ) I am paying for it. I cut the cable now its time to cut google. They now seem to be inline on how apple operates. Not sure how to dump YouTube ( cant ) Google ( Alphabet ) should change their name to YouTube thats all they are to me now. I am done. If I am forced to try something different then ............................ Ms. Porat shame shame shame. How is this taxing the rich. ( the rich is Google ) .... Just as greedy as anyone. Lets see how fun it is to work for Google over the next few years now that they have a new bottom line financial boss. Craig Nelson Apple will eventually open iMessage to android much like blackberry did with BBM. Apple is a business too and iMessage makes them money so eventually they will want to increase to even more profits and will expand the app. As for Google, I lost hope for them after the disappointing Allo. Oh well Sir_Brizz It's doubtful they will ever do that as iMessage is a huge selling point to their devices. JD They won't and don't need to do it. They went the other way made SMS available on all Mac products as long as you have an iPhone. DoctorRabbitfoot As much as I hate it - Facebook has Messenger figured out. Its pretty usable on every platform, even a web browser, they keep adding fun things that are "sticky", and in most social circles, Facebook is a constant. If they ever add SMS fall back....wow. I've used it for friends groups, co-workers, and sports teams. I know someone will come here and tell me how their social circle doesn't apply or Facebook is the devil, blah blah. I get it, you are a fringe case. Facebook is hugely popular and their messenger is doing really well in the States. No idea how it is outside of the country, but well, thats why they bought Whatsapp (maybe?) TheZiltoid Messaging is super important to me messaging my friends and co-workers (who all use iPhones). I hate to say it but I may have to make the switch to iOS. I'm due for an upgrade too. Was looking forward to getting the Pixel. Ugh... Martin I think If they did one of them right, like iMessage and selling stickers and other BS to dumb people who use them, they would make more money... :) Michael Hazell I honestly don't want companies to be trying to harvest my SMS messages in the same way that companies try to harvest messages in general, like Google with harvesting email messages. I'm just using the "stock" SMS app in Lineage OS at this point, because I can no longer use Hangouts, which I've been doing ever since KitKat. It's a shame that they've gone this far in this ridiculous suite of messaging apps. The good news is that a lot of folks, at least around me, either use SMS or Facebook Messenger. The more Google can't keep themselves straight on what they do, the more they look inferior to other platforms. I'd like universal RCS to be a thing with carriers, sooner rather than later. I'm kinda sick of the whole notion of companies profiting via message apps. At least with carriers they're regulated to an extent when it comes to handling information and what they can do with it; these other companies aren't. abc "In my eyes, this would have been a very difficult case for Google to make to the consumer, as it would have been seen as an invasion of privacy into a known entity." It's never been an issue for them before, it's practically what they do. JD Done and done. Move to iOS and use Whatsapp. To hell with Hangouts and Google. YuCMi I chose to give Google the middle finger and use Signal instead. I don't need Assistant in my messages, and I want my conversations private. fonix232 I'd argue slightly with this. While it definitely makes sense that Google does this for business, what makes more sense is that they're separating messaging services to separate apps because of the trust/monopoly lawsuits and allegations that popped up recently in Europe. To make it more clear: Android has an open-source SMS app. Play Services packages Google's own messaging app (let's call it X for simplicity), which can do SMS, Hangouts, RCS, Allo, Duo, et cetera. It's an all in one solution. As it is part of the GPS package (GPS being Google Play Services here), it would be installed on most, if not all phones, by default. Manufacturers, such as Samsung, modify the AOSP apps (theming, adding features when deemed necessary, etc.). Google of course won't add X features to the AOSP app, partly because of licensing/proprietary bits, and partly because, why should they? Samsung/Sony/Huawei/OnePlus/LG take the AOSP source, theme the default app, but do not touch it much since there's an already working and complete solution by Google that WILL ship with the device, which means nobody will really use the AOSP app, so there's no point working on it. This means that the overall best app to use any/all mobile messaging services will be the only one developed by Google. Which ships with most/all phones. And we got a nice Internet Explorer case on our hands. Something that Google wants to avoid. Hence, they break up the solutions into separate bits that manufacturers can (optionally) replace with their own solution. Want a proprietary chat solution? Replace Hangouts/Allo! Want SMS and RCS? Replace messaging! Want 1-on-1 video calls? Replace Duo! DragoCubed It doesn't justify why Allo can't run on all platforms purely through the web like hangouts or telegram. Michael Payton Another option: just use the native texting app that already comes with your phone and ignore everything else. I do not use Allo or any of the other Google or 3rd party messaging apps, including Facebook Messenger and yet, somehow my life carries on. I still manage to communicate with everyone that I need to. Bruce Wayne Right. Peterson Silva You're ignoring one part of the equation: for the guy who's talking to the CFO to convince her to create Allo he'd have to show a profit motive, right? But what profit can come out of a product no one uses? Because that ship's sinking. Wouldn't it make more sense to first build the user base and then present assistant? And for that first thing to be done right a more cohesive, all-in-one approach would be better, I guess. blueman24 1. Google should make Android Message's a part of g suite. 2. For me, having 2 apps is OK but Allo having all the functionality like proper desktop support and universal chat backup (*cough* hangouts *cough*) is far more important. Rod WhatsApp is already the world standard for messaging. Google's services don't make any difference. Rod Sometimes I'm actually glad WhatsApp is the go-to app for messaging, worldwide (except the US). John Edwards Good article. I definitely lost sight of he business aspect...Makes more sense that it doesn't make sense. Hridja Tripathi One of the most insightful articles i've read. Thanks David This was a really good article. I have been using an iPhone for two months now and iMessage has been one of the bright spots when using it. If you don't have an iPhone you get a regular text but if you do you get all new ways of messaging whether it be with games or all the other stuff Allo offers as well. The point is that it works and I'm hoping Google can eventually get to that point. I won't hold my breath though. Timmy Turner Great write up! Couldn't have said it better myself. Soda Nebula Android is all about customization, personalization and options. Since when is that a problem? I always think its wrong when people want a ubiquitious standard for android to be like fb or iphone. Why cant they 'fix' hangouts? Because it alienates those who like it as is, when it was going to be built from the ground up anyways. Imagine all the confused old people who wake up and theyre unable to use basic text functions because its different without warning. Inb4 muh integrations Tomás O’Mertà How do you get from "most of the world has moved on from SMS" to "SMS usage has increased in North America and represents almost 75% of all mobile messaging in the US and Canada"? Do you have figures to support this, or are you revealing a bias when you say "Abandon Android altogether and switch to iOS"? Ed Malcolm Great article. But as a 52 yo, tech semi-savi, Nexus 5x, project fi user; I'm NEVER going to use any texting app but the what's behind the icon at bottom right of my home screen. Whatsapp?? What's that?!? Hangouts?? I'd hang up. If can't send a text to ANYONE with a cell phone- I ain't using it. I use Slack for work. Know why? There are a select group of people I must communicate with, but not all of whom I want to have my phone number- Privacy. l always choose the highest privacy settings, not because I don't want anyone to know what I'm saying or where I'm at, but I just don't I want to see ads as a result. So this article did was show me that I'll pay for not having ads. I'd pay an extra $5 a month to eliminate ads. Maybe I'm an iPhone guy after all. Who knew? drorharari Trevor, you miss the point just like the Google folks. I, as much of the Android and iOS ecosystem already have WhatsApp and many also have Facebook Messenger and other messaging apps like Skype, Hangouts, etc. There is no incentive for me to try Allo as no one I know uses it and on the have if it, no value proposition (for me, not for Google) is evident. So the question then boils down to "does Google care about me using Allo at all?" because if it doesn't then why should we bother. On the other hand, if Google does care about people using Allo then they should act this way. SMS support is not what Google strives to offer in Allo but it is the only sure way to get people on board. Had Google made Allo the replacement to Android Messenger, people would have had no real reason not to use it, moreover, it would have been the default (just like IMessage is in iOS). Then Allo would have been able to automatically switch to RCS or to their own protocol when they detect the other side also have Allo (currently and extremely unlikely event but being the Android's default, that would have been a rather likely event). Hence, and contrary to your theory, I and most others are getting the (probably correct) message that Google does not care much about messaging and there's no real reason to bother with it. It will be gone in a quarter or two like many trial balloons Google had floated in the past. Michael Oghia Fascinating. Thanks for this! kalehv I think the whole point of Allo supporting SMS fallback is only relevant in North America where people still use SMS. Rest of the world doesn't care about SMS at all. Almost all of my friends using iPhones use WhatsApp as de facto messaging app. they care the least about iMessage. cyc Is iMessage seriously reason enough for people to buy iPhones?!? Jeez... Also, hangouts is or was way more advanced than any other IM platform: it was only truly multiplatform, connected to your Gmail not your mobile number, with great video conferencing. Kirk Broadhurst If the "bottom line" is the only thing that mattered, they'd have improved Hangouts. It's far riskier - in terms of user base - to start a new app. And without users there's no "bottom line" improvement. Mathieu Laflamme You should add to the list YouTube since you can now chat in it (maybe only in Canada yet)! And Google+ plus too because sharing a post to one person is pretty much sending a message... D.Smithee I've got a friend who I thought was Android for life--and then he tried iOS and could never leave iMessage..or at least that's the way he explains it. As for all these messaging apps--I just choose the one that has everyone I know on it...Facebook Messenger. Marti Abernathey Eh. What you're saying makes sense if users move from the old Google messaging apps to the new. I've been a Hangouts/Google user since the beginning. I'm now using Textra/WhatsApp for messaging. Google messaging apps are just less elegant and more fragmented. Why would I use them? I don't mind being data mined if you're giving me something. But I personally don't see the value here. Markoff the article doesn't make sense: 1. what's cost benefit splitting Allo hand Duo into two apps? 2. what's cost benefit developing Messenger/Android Messages separately from Allo? mattman723 Tbh I don't mind multiple platforms, I just tell people I'm accessible through any and all methods. I only hate that you cannot "leave" a group SMS. Jadephyre Most people I know that use an iPhone exclusively use Whatsapp, except when needing to send an SMS to people not using any form of smartphone. James Briano Google has no coherent messaging strategy. Their internal teams are either competing with each other, or simply not communicating (maybe they should all get WhatsApp). Recall Google insiders bragging that the Pixel was designed in complete isolation from the Android team. That's nothing to brag about—that's a problem. scy breaking news is a business, of course what it does is about making money, what business isn't? Railwayman Some interesting theories here. One thing I have a hard time to understand is this logic: "SMS fallback is not supported because Google doesn't make money off SMS" - OK, they don't make any more money from SMS even with a separate client. So if that would be the case, then they would just use the basic AOSP SMS client with absolutely no frills (just the barebones). Since we are talking Google/Alphabet it is a bit hard to see how it can bring "more revenue" to have a lot of different messaging apps. It is one thing that we have WhatsApp, Viber, Skype etc since it is... different companies and they want your money but here we have one company. I just fail to see how it can bring more revenue when you use Google Allo instead of Google Hangouts. Or using Google Duo instead of Google Hangouts. Or... IF there would be any kind of "sensible business" here - i.e. that "many messaging apps=increased revenue" then we would see other companies following suit. I.e. WhatsApp Messenger, WhatsApp Trio, WhatsApp Friends&Family, WhatsApp GetTogether, WhatsApp Connect and so on - IF we buy into the thesis that "many messaging apps=increased revenue". Yet... we don't see this kind of strategy from the competition. Apple, which care a lot about their revenues would also have a couple of different messengers *if* there would be a strong business case here. I can't believe for a second that they would just keep iMessage and FaceTime if there would be a compelling business case of having a couple of other options. To recap: It doesn't make any business sense to develop a lot of different apps from *the same company* for the very basic thing of "messaging". A more appropriate strategy is to make *one* major service and to make it really good. It is actually pretty simple and no excuses about "business cases with many messengers" change it even a little bit. Android need: Android Messenger Description: Android Messenger is the default messaging client in the Android OS. It supports SMS (carrier and Google Voice), RCS and Android Messages instant messages (based off Hangouts). It automatically select Android Messages when the recipient has AM on their device, otherwise RCS with SMS fallback. All messages are automatically backed up to the cloud and integrated with Gmail. The user can setup Android Messenger using their SIM based number, GV number or Gmail address and it is done when the setup guide is running on first boot unless the account is configured already. Android Messenger work on smartphones, tablets and computers - every device that can sign in to a Gmail account is compatible since AM is part of Gmail. When you setup Gmail you simply get AM as well. Android Messenger is the standard client on Android devices shipped with G-Apps and is also the basic part of every G-App package. Android Messenger can be plugged in with a dialer tab for Google Voice accounts and is also seamlessly integrated with the Contacts app. I.e. all messages goes through AM. This would make sense and bring a viable competitor to iMessage. Explanations along the lines of "the business case of having several messages", "the carriers don't like default messaging apps", "Samsung doesn't like default messaging apps" and so on are just... excuses for a messed up system. Google can roll out Android Messenger for the simple reason that they have a dominating platform. What should the carrier do? Every Android device has AM so... their only option then would be to sell iPhone only BUT... they can't put their own client on there EITHER. So should they go back to selling feature phones? And Samsung? Telling Google that they are going to use Tizen if they can't put their own SMS client on? Especially now when they accepted GPM as their music player. I can say this: No OEM or carrier are going to stop using or selling Android because Google roll out Android Messenger in O or P. It is not exactly that way that we are going to see a "mass exodus" from the platform because they decided to integrate AM. If anyone seriously believe that Android is commonplace because the messaging app can be replaced by either "OEM Messenger" or "Carrier Messenger" I must recommend a reality check. And no, I don't think there will be any platform suddenly getting traction because "we hate instant messengers and we boycott Android but embrace new platform X because we can replace its messaging client". Especially not today when the carriers offer "unlimited texting". So Google can create a unified Android Messenger and push it on all devices without any problems with boycott or mass exodus of partners and carriers. The question is rather if they are able to assemble all their different teams and merge them in order to create Android Messenger. One thing is for sure: They have a lot to gain and very little to loose since such a client would get a lot of traction at the expense of WhatsApp and the likes by being integrated and the default option. Immediately when there are two devices with O or P for example everything is just... set and the messages are heading down the Google street. So if Google want to maximize revenue from messages, then this is the way to go - especially with Assistant integration. Michael Sørensen "most of the world has moved on from SMS" But has it though? I know SMS usage is down and still falling, but is it really that much down? Certainly not where I live (Europe). Matt This seems like a lot of words to say "They abandoned Hangouts because it was easier to build something from the ground up that they could mine data from." It also doesn't really put forth an evidence that it would be easier to build a new app, nor does it provide any real argument why the replacement wouldn't be more cohesive. snowglyder Good write-up. As I agree with all your points, it doesn't help Google if their users no longer trust whether they'll keep a service or not. Speaking for myself, I recently bailed on all Google messaging platforms for Signal and SMS. The SMS removal from Hangouts did it for me, and it seems like others too. It's no easy feat to get your friends/family to move messaging platforms, so continuing with Google for messaging wasn't a moving target I wanted to pursue. I recently got the S8 and stayed with using Samsung's Messages app, as it works over WiFi. I noticed that if the other person is using their Messages app for SMS also, you get read receipts, delivery notification, and can see when they're typing. iMessage-like. Good enough! Roy After I understand what RCS is a think Google on the right way. Hangout it's base on SMS and attitude is old, Also Android messenger is old you don't have feature like stickers and voice message. So if and when Allow integrate wish RCS it's could to be the next iMessage for all Android device, especially if Google Will require all companies to install it on their phones. It's will take all the users​ from WhatsApp and some Facebook messenger and give them everything in one place with Google Assistant, backup and secure chat option.

The Google Home has a built-in library of relaxing ambient audio Paul Quinn Follow View All Posts 2017/05/06 7:26am PDTMay 6, 2017 45 Plus 1 on G+ 122 Share on Facebook 62 Share on Twitter Total Shares229 Google Home Videos Update 1: 2017/05/06 10:12am PDT While Google's support page says the feature is limited to Google Homes in United States, there are reports of it working outside 'Murica as well. Feeling like you want to relax after you've finished that meal you prepared with Google Home's help? Overwhelmed by your Home's answer to what's on your schedule tomorrow? Just ask it to help you relax with some soothing ambient sounds. Currently offering a catalog of 15 different ambient sound themes, Google Home can now replace your sound machine. The ambient sound themes include nature sounds, water sounds, fireplace sounds, and country sounds. The latter of those is crickets, lots of crickets. The ocean sounds theme must be based on heavy seas because I found that one a little too stimulating. If you're feeling lucky (that's Google Play Music lingo), you can just say, "Help me relax," and your Google Home will select a theme for you. Do you want to fall asleep to relaxing sounds? No problem. You can tell your Google Home to play one of these relaxing themes for a specified amount of time. For example, you can say, "Hey Google, play forest sounds for two hours." You'll hear the sounds of the forest for two hours, and then your Home will slowly fade out the audio. If you don't specify a time limit, it will default to one hour. Google has even included this helpful video on their support page. Let Tech With Brett take it away. Google notes that you can press and hold your finger on the top of the device to activate your Google Home instead of speaking the wake word. I'm not sure what the advantage of this is because you still need to speak your request to play an ambient sound theme. If you are going to talk to your Home anyway, you might as well wake it with your voice too. I can already imagine combining these sounds with Hue lighting scenes to create my own voice activated relaxation chamber.

What is their excuse now? Tiuri Elvander The Home isn't even available outside of the US (and the UK), so it's not like many people will miss out :( Alex Since the Google Home has launched in the UK, every new feature for it (multi user, recipes, etc) has not. The week after it launched, Google changed the shopping list feature to use a service that also hasn't launched in the UK. It also still cannot do any 'skills', meaning that it's basically just a chromecast speaker and a kitchen timer. I'm very glad that SOMEONE at Google cares about Google Home for them to have rolled out a number of updates to it over the past few weeks, but as someone who dropped £130 on it expecting it - from reviews of the American version - to be better than the Amazon Echo, the constant stream of "HERE'S NEW STUFF - BUT NOT FOR YOU" is getting pretty tiresome. NooSH first off all , you should already know that by now so your whining is getting as tiresome as what your'e crying about.. second: maybe blame your own country for that?, pretty sure if every country didn't have international restrictions and laws when it comes to tech, everyone would have everything.. google makes money , that's their job, pretty sure they would want to make as much as possible.. it's like you blaming a clerk for not having a certain item in store. -_- Lars Jeppesen So it is for legal reasons, according to you, that multi user is not available outside the US? Nicholas Conrad I think he just wants to believe in a silver lining to brexit. Lars Jeppesen LOL Alex I've literally never posted on this site about this before ever. You must have an incredibly low threshold for getting tired. I'm also pretty certain there are no laws stopping Google from making some forest noises for the UK, or ensuring that their product can do at a bare minimum what their direct competitor can in the country. What I'm blaming is Google, the developers of the product, from not supporting that product in a country they have released said product in. LondonLeedsFan Absolutely. Release a product, sell it at full price, and provide us with a limited, half-baked and delayed service. Thanks Google! xyz First of all, you should know that no one gives a shit about your feelings. Anyway, nothing funnier than people who are ignorant about everything outside their borders lecturing people on their country's law and regulations. Nicholas Conrad Do you even KNOW how long the us had to wait for crappy 'BBC America' to drop episodes​ of Downton Abbey?? Months! Months after they aired in gb. We live in the internet age, how the crap do you avoid spoilers for *months*? You can't, that's how! Get your shit together and then maybe, just maybe we'll let you have ambient sounds. Alex I'm... sorry? I guess I'll get right onto ITV and ask them why an American company using the BBC's name didn't show a terrible programme sooner? If I do that, will you get Google to stop being shit about supporting their own product? LondonLeedsFan Mate, if you want Downton Abbey, you're more than welcome to it! ;) Lars Jeppesen And we're quite a lot of people who imported the GH - some of us do travel. :) I'm seriously pissed and baffled about why a function like this is only available to the US market.. what's the reason? There must be something.. I don't have multi user either, seriously pissed about it.. why Google, why? Edit: I was prematurely pissed - the relax sounds actually works for me (I'm in Denmark, Europe) Nicholas Conrad Why aren't you NATing it and using a stateside proxy server then? Lars Jeppesen I tried using a VPN bit didn't work.. maybe I need to set it up from scratch again Nicholas Conrad Hmm, is your language setting set to us english? Lars Jeppesen Yes, language is US English, also on my phone LondonLeedsFan We don't even have podcasts on Play Music yet in the UK. Tiuri Elvander For some reason I just got them this weekend. Go to the Play Music website and log out and log in again. Maybe if you have a secondary google account, try that and then return to your main account. I logged in using my dad's account and then when I logged in using my own account again, I got the new look (mid 2016 look) Play Music, including podcasts! Srujan Probably for those panicking over losing healthcare protection on their pre-existing conditions. ericshmerick We get it, you don't like him. Your post is wholly inaccurate by the way.

Lars Jeppesen Hhmm it works for me and I'm in Denmark Zsolt V I don't know but rest assured there is a reason. It's not like some PM says, let's not launch in the UK because they still have a queen. ericshmerick This is awesome since one of my Google Home's is on my bedside table. I just wish there was a way to have separate volume settings for media (this) and alarms. When falling asleep to these ambient sounds, I'll probably have the volume at ~30%. I prefer the alarm volume to be at ~70%. There isn't a way to change it after I've fallen asleep since the 30% setting preserves. One day I guess. jstew182 This is the feature I would like most too come to Home. I wish the voice response could be set to a different level as well rather than default to the same level as everything else. I don't need her yelling at me in the middle of the night if I ask her to change to nest temp or to turn off my fan. WretchedGenius You can do that. In your Google Home app, go to your list of devices. Go into the settings for the device you want to control. Under settings there is a category for Alarms & Timers that lets you set a specific volume that is distinct from the normal device volume. ericshmerick Nice, thanks! Jack Smith Wow! Thanks. Never realized you could do this. Ryan Now they just need to have another one for "her." Since I am often telling it to turn things off from across the living room I like to have her turned up but want music to be quieter 😆😄 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/732f2199e4eb5e261095d689c87fe28733f8387ee06831dc2198fb9655728479.png TheScientists "I'm not sure what the advantage of this is because you still need to speak your request to play an ambient sound theme." The advantage is that you don't have your phone, tablet, watch, toaster, etc all going off at the same time fighting over who gets to answer the Ok Google request. Paul Quinn The whole point of these home assistants is not having to go physically touch them to use them. I assume that most people have figured out a way to avoid activating multiple devices to use their Home. "Hey Google" is a good way to avoid activating phones and tablets. The multiple activations issue does need to be addressed though. Andrew Palmer Works on my UK Home Lars Jeppesen Ditto for me (Denmark) Willie Chalmers III "The Google Home"? That just sounds odd. Paul Quinn I debated on that. I think I prefer the ominous nature of it. Reminds me of THE Borg. xyz It's appropriate because now Google can listen to everything you say at home. Nick Riviera It works terribly, like quite a few new services. Amit Interesting. No such issues for me. I haven't found home to falter even once, from what I asked for... el conejo Don't worry I'll place a logic bomb called "America Only" and that sh*t will blow up your network trafficking toolkit Paul Quinn We've updated the article because some of you are able to get this to work outside the US. Thanks for that info! Zsolt V How about checking first before spreading FUD? Paul Quinn The Google Home support page said at the time of publication and still at this moment, in red print at the top, "This is only available in the US." I had no reason to doubt such basic information. When we discover possible inaccuracies like this in a post, we act as quickly as possible to update the information. CD RW can't wait to have my nightly ASMR from Google Badouken I've been using this when reading, it makes for a relaxing read. surethom Does not work here in the UK. Unless u have to pay for subscription which I don't. Blake Sinnett They need to add this. https://youtu.be/ZPoqNeR3_UA Paul Quinn Totally! Tell your Home.... Say, "Hey Google, I want to give feedback." Jack Smith Are you not the author? Are you not suppose to know the device? The poster can do this on the GH no problem and should that not be the answer? Jack Smith You can use it and I do similar with others. Just ask your GH to play it. Most nights we listen say at bedtime "hey google play 10 hours of thunderstorms" and it plays it from YouTube. But thanks for sharing because this is what I will use this evening for sure. Hope the wife does not mind. Jack Smith Love the ambient sounds built-in. But my preference right now is the 10 hours of thunderstorms with flutes from YouTube. Highly recommend. The problem with the others is they do not last long enough. Jack Smith Well re-reading article I am a dork. Never thought to ask for a time period with the built-in white noise. Jack Smith This is not a US only thing you just can play ambient or white noise from YouTube and we do it all the time. Tons more selection and some really good ones. But I really wish the author would know the GH better and share such things. Everytime he writes on the GH drives me nuts as pretty much every time there is incorrect information or something misleading or key points missing and has to be cleaned up in the comments area. Why? Paul Quinn The Google Home support page said at the time of publication and still at this moment, in red print at the top, "This is only available in the US." I had no reason to doubt such basic information. When we discover possible inaccuracies like this in a post, we act as quickly as possible to update the information. The difference here (and the point of the article) was that the GH has this feature built in and includes the ability to set a timer with it. The GH has always been able to play audio tracks of any kind. I guess I could have mentioned this alternate means of playing ambient sound in a sentence. Thanks for the feedback! I am new to this so it all just fine tunes my writing! Cory S If you tell it to play it to a chromecast, they appear to just be existing youtube videos. ED-Zが現れた! My favorite ambient audio is, still, Stickerbrush Symphony. ED-Zが現れた! Humn... Can it change automatically to Song of Storms when it detect sound of rain and thunderstorms?

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Hayley Tsukayama By Hayley Tsukayama May 8 at 6:45 PM Follow @htsuka (Harman Kardon) Microsoft said Monday that it has partnered with audio equipment maker Harman Kardon to put the tech giant's voice-activated assistant, Cortana, into a smart speaker of its very own. The Invoke, as the speaker is called, will allow its owners to use the speaker like a phone, by using Microsoft's Skype. It will also have features similar to its competitors, such as the ability to control smart appliances and tell users what the traffic conditions are like on their commutes, what the latest news is, and what their schedules look like that day. The move puts Microsoft into direct competition with Amazon's Echo and Google Home — both smart speakers that are designed to act as a "home hub" for smart devices and digital information. (Amazon.com chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Washington Post.) [Microsoft takes aim at Apple and Google in the classroom with new products] Microsoft hasn't announced a smart speaker that it will make, but it appears to be partnering with firms to create gadgets dedicated to its voice assistant. Amazon's Alexa assistant, which powers its Echo speakers, has also made the jump to other gadgets through partnerships with other companies; Google is expected to do the same with its assistant. Analysts have pointed to home hubs and voice assistants as a major next battleground for tech companies, as the firms look to permeate even more aspects of consumers' lives. A home hub is placed to anchor a larger web of devices such as lightbulbs and — possibly — vehicles that can be activated by voi6ce and tap into a central bank of data that can be used to run consumers' lives. Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Apple and Samsung have all introduced their own named voice assistants. Microsoft first introduced Cortana in 2013; it originally worked on Windows PCs and Windows Phone. The company also released apps that allow the assistant to work on Android and iOS devices, but this is the first time the software has showed up in a dedicated device. [Google’s smart home hub is promising, but still a work in progress] The fight for dominance in the home hub space is expected to become even fiercer. Apple is also rumored to be making a similar device for its Siri digital assistant, according to a recent note from KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. (Kuo put the chances of an Apple device at more than 50 percent, according to a report from MacRumors.) Harman Kardon — a division of Samsung Electronics subsidiary Harman — said the Invoke speaker will be available in the fall at Microsoft stores and "select retail partners." It has not released a price for the speaker. business technology the-switch true Please provide a valid email address. Sign up You’re all set!

While Chrome users have had the ability to read offline for a while now, Google has made several improvements which, when taken as a whole, should make it a more seamless experience. In December 2017, Google introduced the ability to download webpages for offline reading. However, anyone who missed the news won’t yet be taking advantage of the feature. Thankfully, Google has now improved its usefulness in several ways, giving us another chance to talk about it. Simple Minds Need Simple Instructions According to The Keyword blog, Chrome users are now downloading “more than 45 million web pages” every week. However, when you consider how many people use Chrome on Android, that’s not a very impressive figure. Which is probably why Google has attempted to simplify the process. The first improvement means you can now long-press on any link to be given the option to download it in its entirety. Previously, you had to open the menu and tap the Save icon. It’s a small change, but a significant one at a time when people value simplicity Simplicity To The Rescue: 4 Apps You Can Use To Tame The Web Simplicity To The Rescue: 4 Apps You Can Use To Tame The Web Taking a digital vacation may not be possible for most of us.

The second improvement will only reveal itself when you try to load up a page while offline. With Chrome unable to connect to the internet, you’ll see the option to Download Page Later. Once tapped, Chrome will download the page for you as soon as you get back online. The third improvement makes it easier to see the pages you have previously downloaded to read offline How Do I Download an Entire Website for Offline Reading?

Now, when you open a new tab, you’ll see all of the articles you’ve downloaded tagged with a new Offline badge. These articles were previously hidden behind an icon in the main menu. These new features are available in the latest version of Chrome on Android. So all you need to do is update Chrome to the latest version, find a webpage you want to download, and tap the Download icon. There’s no word yet on when Google will push the improvements out to iOS users. Making Pocket and Instapaper Redundant The ability to download webpages to read offline is one most of us will use occasionally. And by baking the feature right into Chrome, Google could be making dedicated offline readers such as Pocket Supercharge Your Pocket Experience With These IFTTT Recipes Supercharge Your Pocket Experience With These IFTTT Recipes Between the two of them, Pocket and IFTTT are excellent services that do their part in making their users more productive.

"It finally happened! A money manager came on television and admitted that he had made a mistake, that he had an obvious win on his hands and he punted, he didn't take advantage of it," the "Mad Money" host said. "That's the good news. Accountability at last." The bad news was that it happened to be one of the most successful money managers of our time. "Maybe the takeaway is that only the world's greatest investor can afford to openly admit making a mistake. Everyone else just must be too insecure to do the same thing," Cramer said. Watch the full segment here: show chapters Cramer's takeaways from Warren Buffett's Google mistake    8 Hours Ago | 12:27 Buffett's self-proclaimed flubs aside, Cramer touted the investment guru's legacy, from buying into best-of-breed companies trading at discounts to his unrelenting optimism about the future of the United States. "He's genuinely curious; he's skeptical without being cynical; and despite his folksy demeanor, he doesn't suffer fools gladly, which is why he's willing to make harsh judgments if a CEO's got it wrong," as he did with former Wells Fargo chief John Stumpf. All that said, Buffett's statements about his Google miss intrigued Cramer. Buffett admitted that he realized the value of Google early, when Berkshire's auto insurance subsidiary, GEICO, was seeking advertising outlets. Buffett understood the power of Google's advertising business even then. People who wanted to buy insurance quickly would search it via Google for instant gratification. "He admitted that he recognized Google's cost of taking that ad was virtually nil, that it represented nearly 100 percent profit. He even met with the founders of Google," Cramer said. Still, Buffett did not pull the trigger on buying shares, which he attributed in part to being unsure who would ultimately win in the advertising space. Back then, Google, now Alphabet, traded at $300 a share and has since soared to $950. "What can we learn from this mistake? First, we have to recognize a humbling, humbling thing: stock picking is really difficult. Few people would've had the kind of insight that Buffett had about Google, and yet he didn't buy it," Cramer said. Buffett later purchased shares of IBM, a move he would come to see as preemptive because the company's promising technologies did not grow as quickly as he expected. "When you put Buffett's IBM pick alongside his failure to pull the trigger on Google, you have to conclude that nobody in this business gets it right all the time. If even the 'Oracle of Omaha' can make this kind of mistake, then you can understand why I'm so adamant that you keep your retirement money in a low-cost index fund that mirrors the S&P 500," Cramer said. The S&P 500 sidelines the worst companies and benefits from takeover activity, so investing in a low-cost fund like the Buffet-praised Vanguard would be a smart move, Cramer said. "How about takeaway number two? Once you have your bedrock index fund investment and you keep adding to that every year, if you do have some spare cash, why not try to put it to work in some stocks that you can find yourself?" the "Mad Money" host asked. The best example of this in Buffett's world was his call on Apple. When he saw younger generations glued to their Apple devices, he began to see it not as a technology company, but as a consumer products powerhouse that sold at a major discount to the other consumer goods plays. Even now, measured against similarly structured companies, Apple remains very cheap, Cramer argued. Cramer's final takeaway was that keeping your eyes open is key to picking and buying the right companies at the right time. "I could argue that Google itself, now that it's expanding beyond just search into YouTube video, data centers, [and] self-driving cars — that may be a big bargain given the misperception that it's still merely a search play hostage to the advertising market," the "Mad Money" host said. And while Cramer does not recommend simply piling your favorite companies into a portfolio and hoping things work out, there is much to be said about playing the field like Buffett does. "If you want to augment your index fund with a few stock picks of your own, I think that's a totally responsible and, frankly, thrilling way to try your hand at growing wealth beyond the ordinary, even if the ordinary has done pretty darned well all by itself," Cramer said.

Google's "Fuchsia" operating system is taking shape with a new design Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/08 10:01am PDTMay 8, 2017 29 Plus 1 on G+ 243 Share on Facebook 78 Share on Twitter Total Shares350 Development Google News We first talked about Fuchsia, a new operating system being developed at Google, back in August (in fact, it was my first post here). At the time, there wasn't much to get excited about besides the potential - it only had a command-line interface. Now the project has a snazzy new, but clearly unfinished, interface. Summary of Fuchsia First, it's worth going over exactly what Fuchsia is, because it's been quite a while since we talked about it. As opposed to all of Google's other OSes, such as Android and Chrome OS, Fuchsia uses the company's new 'Magenta' kernel instead of Linux. According to the project's documentation, Magenta is designed for "modern phones and modern personal computers with fast processors, non-trivial amounts of ram with arbitrary peripherals doing open ended computation." Magenta's apps and the system interface are written with Google's Flutter SDK, which was initially designed to create cross-platform apps for iOS and Android. Flutter applications are written in Dart, the company's home-grown programming language. All of the system and apps are rendered by 'Escher,' which uses OpenGL or Vulkan to display everything. The 'Armadillo' interface So, on to the new stuff. Fuchsia's system UI has a new name - 'Armadillo.' Ars Technica was able to compile Armadillo into an Android APK, since it is written with the above-mentioned Flutter SDK. The interface doesn't really do anything besides looking pretty, but it does give us an idea of what the finished product could look like. The home screen is a vertical list, with a profile picture, the time, and a battery indicator in the center. Tapping the profile picture brings up something similar to Android's Quick Settings, with toggles for auto-rotate, do not disturb, Airplane Mode, and so on. Above the profile picture is the 'Story,' which the documentation describes as "a set of apps and/or modules that work together for the user to achieve a goal." Currently, this works similarly to Android's Recents screen. Users will also be able to combine stories into a 'Story Cluster.' This is what dragging a Story card into split-screen looks like. Dragging a Story card onto another one triggers a split-screen mode. The user can split an app 50/50 vertically or horizontally, drag in another app for a 33/33/33 split, or even have a tab bar appear for using all the open apps in full-screen. You can even have two apps split vertically next to two other split apps, seen below. This is far more flexible than Android's current multi-tasking functionality, but whether or not it will stay this way is uncertain. Below the profile picture is a panel resembling Google Now, with a placeholder search bar and suggestion cards. Armadillo's documentation says, "a suggestion is a representation of an action the user can take to augment an existing story or to start a new one. [The] suggestion contains enough information to create the visual representation of that concept." So maybe they will work more like an app launcher? It's hard to tell at this point. The Google Now panel, showing Fuchsia's keyboard. Keep in mind that all of this is subject to change, as the Armadillo interface (and the rest of Fuchsia OS) is still under heavy development. It's also hard to tell what Google's plans are for the operating system. Will it be neglected to Internet-of-Things devices and other basic hardware, or will it some day replace Android altogether? We'll have to wait and see.

Suicide_Note Because Google can. Corbin Davenport Ron from Ars Technica put it best: "Fuchsia really seems like a project that asks 'how would we design Android today, if we could start over?' It's a brand-new, Google-developed kernel running a brand-new, Google-developed SDK that uses a brand-new, Google-developed programming language and it's all geared to run Google's Material Design interface as quickly as possible. Google gets to dump Linux and the GPL, it can dump Java and the problems it caused with Oracle, and Google can basically insulate itself from all of Android's upstream projects and bring all the development in-house. Doing such a thing on the scale of Android today would be a massive project." makapav Would it still be open source? Also, what would happen to all the existing APKs? Corbin Davenport Fuchisa is completely open source right now. As for running Android apps, maybe Google will add some kind of stop-gap compatibility layer for running Android apps, like Chrome OS has. destinyhud read the article Suicide_Note Perhaps instead of replacing Android, this will *become* Android, as in Android P or Q? Or be the merger of Android/Chrome? m477 I could see that as Android 10. Definitely too early for P. morteum I wonder if the reason it is called "Armadillo" is because they're starting from A again, but this time they're using animals instead of desserts. Christopher Bement I think it's a smart plan, based on the guess that there's more animals to pick from in the world than tasty desserts. teolinux Ubuntu docet Paul "Tasty treats," not necessarily desserts. That said, armadillos could be a tasty treat. I won't judge. MJ I have heard desserts and candy used before which are wrong but "tasty treats" is a new one for me. To be more accurate, Android names are actually all confectionery foods. A "tasty treat" could be a slice of pizza (aka Android S). LOL Randy Gindy Armadillo is the name of the UI not the OS build itself. Matt74UK Smooth on the inside, crunchy on the outside. Armadillo ! (a few UK people of a certain age may get that). John Doe Idk this is a whole new OS with a new kernel, I doubt this will be done with an OTA update for Android. Mantas Pakėnas Even nowadays, some of Android's new functionality cannot be done via OTA updates (like dual system partitions, forced encryption I believe, etc). To make a completely hard cut sometime when this is ready, and if it's meant to replace Android, is not completely unimaginable. As is updating via OTA. If apple was able to change their file system via OTA, I don't see why changing most of the parts would not be possible. However, nobody aside from Google would do it, almost guaranteed :) Suicide_Note It could likely be done for Pixel devices, and possibly for future devices released after this new version of the OS rolls out. Adrian Meredith quite possibly, after all there no reason it couldn't also run android apps jonathan What they need to do is make this googles very own os for their pixel line and leave android for the oems Suicide_Note Not a chance. To much name recognition with Android for Google to drop it in favor of something else specific to the Pixel lineup. Dallas King Android Z confirmed! Suicide_Note More like Android A for Armadillo. m477 APK plz (no, really, I want a compiled apk the demo) Maxwell “Max” Weinbach https://github.com/fuchsia-mirror/sysui MJ Your link wasn't what the OP asked for... Maxwell “Max” Weinbach the only way to get the APK is to compile it yourself, so I linked to the Github page to a place to download the files to compile. The closest they will get. MJ Than you should have replied there is no known APK or not at all. Maxwell “Max” Weinbach It does not matter that much. I am building the APK right now. Once it is done I will post it. Here is the link on how to compile it. http://www.hotfixit.net/single-post/2017/05/03/How-to-build-Armadillo MJ Don't waste your time... They updated that article with an download of the APK. Maxwell “Max” Weinbach thanks. they just did that. I still compiled it myself though. I will try to get more out of it while I have the Sysui downloaded. Michel R. https://www.androidfilehost.com/?w=files&flid=178684 there you go MJ http://www.hotfixit.net/single-post/2017/05/03/How-to-build-Armadillo Latex beats nudity More of Proprietary code ? No thank you, we already had enough with this Pixel crud. I hope this OS dies quicker or become a chromebook OS. m477 It's open source. Latex beats nudity It's OSS but just like Android It'll be more heavily dependent on the google APIs to make it work. Look at the Pixel SysUI, Just being OSS doesn't make it open source... It's Google's OS not a Linux Based one. If this is going to replace Android It's doomsday on multiple levels. destinyhud billions of people dont care if its running linux kernel or not. maybe very few like u might. do iphone users care why kernel it runs. none of them care. u r just noise tbh Latex beats nudity Billions of people don't code. You are being a kool-aid joke tbh. destinyhud exaclt only few code and even on that few many dont care if it runs linux or not. look at iphone there are more dev there and yet they dont care for kernel. u r delusional in ur own world m477 Android it's already been on a Google-dependent road for years. I don't think this is going to change either way. An Angry Chihuahua https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/magenta/+/master/docs/getting_started.md heres the source code. do some research my dude WitnessG Imagining this running on a Google made processor is exciting. Badouken If this was the OS for the Pixel 2 alongside a Google made processor I think id cry! WitnessG Yeah I don't see this coming out for at least another 2-3 years. Badouken Indeed, but we can dream! ha Suicide_Note Maybe the Pixel 3 or 4 will see the dream become reality. Suicide_Note I'm betting this is what we'll see in a couple years time. As another commenter stated, starting with Armadillo could be Google's way of starting from the beginning (letter A codename), since there's more animal babes to use for each letter than there are dessert names to use. Timothy Vreeland You are getting the furries excited. Nomaan Armadillo should be compared to holo/material and not to dessert names. nachofrand What makes you think Google would be good at making SoCs? They're a software company and don't have the hardware expertise for hardcore ASIC development like that. Granted they can hire people, but in the end, does it matter? They're going to use ARM either way. UnlikeABoss Google fanboyism. The same reason he's excited over a brand new OS. He knows absolutely nothing about it, short of the fact that it will create more fragmentation not only in the OS space, but also the kernel space. So all we know are negative things so far. This is what we call exciting now is it? Why? Just because Google is doing it? If Microsoft made this exact same announcement, would we all be excited? Oh dear. Zsolt V No, because essentially everybody loathes Microsoft. Almost nobody's life would be worse if Microsoft vanished. marcusmarcus2 Don't they design and build their own servers to use for all their websites? Seems like those hardware work well for them. Sergii Pylypenko It's one thing to assemble the server using off-the-shelf components, or even to order a custom motherboard. It's a very different thing to design and manufacture your own chips. marcusmarcus2 I'm not saying it is the same, just that they are not only software experts. Them designing and building the servers show they do have hardware expertise that could assist them in doing the same to chips. Zsolt V Except Google's servers are not assembled from off the shelf components. Haven't been for a few years now. Roy What about TPU? Adrian Vovk Samsung Exynos devices are faster than Snapdragon, iPhones seem underpowered but are extremely snappy, etc. The point is that making both the software and hardware leads to a very fast ecosystem. Also, Google are making the TPU for neural networks nachofrand Yes, as expected. Exynos is faster than Snapdragon on the Galaxy phones, but put an Exynos in another phone...oh wait, you can't. That's the whole entire point. Snapdragon SoCs are general purpose SoCs and can be used for a multitude of phones so they're not custom tuned to every phone individually. Exynos have very specific power rails and the chip is made specifically for that phone. The thing is, sure this is better, but it's marginal and hardly worth talking about. They both use the same ARM architecture so performance gains are pretty negligible. Besides that, this is how Samsung makes money....off of device sales. Google doesn't make money that way. That isn't their business model so at this point it doesn't make sense for them to build their own SoCs when they could just work closer with hardware companies. They make their own TPUs because it aligns with their business model. Adrian Vovk The instruction set doesn't really matter? I can have a 6700k and a 6500k and the 6700k will perform much better even though they are both amd64. With what Google is doing with the Pixels (still as snappy as day one here) I'm pretty sure they can optimize it further than Samsung does. They have made it run smoother in some cases on a chip that they didn't manufacture. If they made their own chip it would allow them many freedoms that they otherwise don't have = easier design of the device. I brought up the TPUs because that is experience in chip manufacturing Jason What makes you say iPhones are under powered ? Apples chips are some of the fastest around and are extremely powerful. Adrian Vovk Specs wise. They have much worse specs on paper and it would lead to a slower experience, except Apple can optimize it because they make both the chip and the OS Stephen Sharp They could use Risc-V and have to pay to license absolutely nothing, while being able to make processors purpose built for their OS Randy Gindy That would be an interesting move. Stephen Sharp Indeed, I really want Risc-V to succeed as an open ISA nachofrand They could. But in my opinion, it's unlikely. Google isn't trying to compete with Samsung and Apple in device sales and that isn't their business model. People using their services so they can show ads is their business model. It doesn't make sense for Google to make their own SoC when others are already doing a good job. Plus, if they went to RISC-V then what? What about the modem? They have to buy a standalone modem from Qualcomm or Intel. Now you have to hire system integration and test engineers to make sure the modem is working with your SoC. Oh and then you need a whole firmware team to control the modem. At that point, buy a full blown SoC with the modem on chip. Stephen Sharp Eh you lost me at "Pixel phone" and all the other hardware they sell. Google also is a Platinum member of the Risc-V foundation, and if there is a direction they are going, more control or less control, I would guess it's "more". But that's just a guess nachofrand Hardware isn't even close to the same thing as asic development. IC design is a different world. Granted they do some custom hardware, but SoCs are a much much larger feat. It's still a possibility they do so, but it doesn't make sense with their current business model imo. Captain On! 1 - Google has stated that they're going to make their own silicon for the Pixels in time. 2 - Google actually owns/operates the world's most powerful quantum computer. They know how to make chips. Randy Gindy That quantum computer was built by DWave though Angel I read (somewhere don’t remember) that they have three different quantum computers systems. One from DWave and two home-produced. From those two, one was made by engineers and not that disimilar from DWave in its operations. The other was made by physicists and uses a different approach. nachofrand 1. I could be wrong, but I've only read that they plan on working closer with chip manufacturers. 2. Google didn't make that computer. Even if they did, quantum is so different those skills don't even translate. Romario Maxwell Google made their own custom ASIC called the Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) for their AI/Machine Learning needs on their cloud platform. See https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2016/05/Google-supercharges-machine-learning-tasks-with-custom-chip.html and https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2017/04/quantifying-the-performance-of-the-TPU-our-first-machine-learning-chip.html nachofrand Sure, although a TPU is just an accelerator. Think of it as the hexagon DSP inside of the Snapdragon SoC. That's like 1/10 of the entire chip. SoC design is much larger. Timothy Vreeland How many examples of hardware design do people have to point out before you stop? Sure the hardware they worked on previously isn't exactly the same... But before they started the hardware they are currently working on, they worked on previous hardware that wasn't the same as what they are doing now. They have shown they are competent in designing many kinds of hardware. Or do you suggest a company can only build one kind of hardware and nothing else for all eternity? How did Samsung make it's current in-house chips? Did they go to ARM college? Have they been making ARM chips since the dawn of time? No. They put together some teams and got to work, so stop blabbing and being negative. sweenish Their AI that finally beat the world's top Go players was running on custom Google chips. It's not like they don't know how. Pixelexel Imagine a Google Pixel with a Google made processor, with Fuschia, with Project Fi with Google WiFi powered by Google fiber. If I'd have this, my life would be complete. Iamsecond Ha, no. A Google processor? Supported for 18 months, then replaced with a new processor that performs half as well (but has stickers.) Does not fully process Android code, because at Google one hand doesn't even know the other hand is there, let alone talk to it. Has 20 cores (only 2 enabled outside US for 'reasons.') Has a dedicated co-processor to enable ads in every app, even those that previously didn't have them. Jason Google can't even get a phone out the door without issues and you want them to make the chips too...lol. I'll pass. UnlikeABoss "In house kernel instead of Linux". Yeah, hopefully this dies in a thousand pits of fire. "Hey Linux guys, you know how you've helped us make billions over the years with a free open source kernel? Well, we were just using you to get the "nerd" userbase. Now we own the market thanks to you guys promoting its use of Linux, we will gradually phase you out." .... m477 I hope not. Linux is not really a kernel made with smartphone in minds. I don't care for being a fan of a kernel over another. UnlikeABoss Yeah. I'd much rather use a brand new untested kernel (and all the teething issues that will come with it) in my smartphone than a mature, stable one that's hacked on by hundreds and thousands of people every month. I mean, it's just a smartphone, we don't need it to be a secure environment, right? Let's just make a nice obscure kernel that no one else will use, and just say "but but it's open source!!! love us because we are Google kk". ... ihsan ışık I'm sorry but it just looks like you are a huge Linux fan and are just against change to me. UnlikeABoss Looks can be deceiving. If you're going to fling around the Linux fanboy term, i'll fling around the Google fanboy term, and that will surely be a nice constructive argument that we will both want to continue. m477 So, in 10 years we should still be using an unoptimised kernel like Linux, because anything newer is, well, newer? UnlikeABoss Yeah, because Linux hasn't changed at all in 10 years... m477 Yes, it changed a lot, and it still has many of the same problems, which are intrinsically bound to its structure. It's not a kernel well suited for mobile devices. UnlikeABoss You think the solution is to throw it out the window and start from scratch? I disagree. I'd much rather continue improving the Linux kernel, simply because of all the eyes it will always have on its code. jonathan Play nice ladies lol m477 With this mentality we wouldn't have Linux at all. Why start anything, while we can continue this other thing which purpose was completely different? A mircokenel is more well suited than a monolitic kernel to a mobile devices, both in terms of performance and security. No matter how much you improve Linux, it will never be a microkernel. UnlikeABoss Smartphones don't need a micro kernel in 2017. You could make that argument 7 years ago. Linux can be compiled with the required drivers just like it always could. m477 I made that argument 7 years ago. They always needed something different from Linux. The fact that specific, even proprietary drivers have to be integrated in the kernel (since Android lacks an abstraction layer) is on of the problems of the interaction Android-Linux. destinyhud why havent the nerds made linux on pc's a bigger market share if they were the one who made android a global leader UnlikeABoss No nerd is promoting Linux on the desktop. All social media used to be full of people promoting Android over iOS, these days there's no need to. destinyhud why havent they promoted desktop?? just wondering why they did for android but not for desktop.. linux on desktop was an underdog for decades. android was not popular because of kernal. android became popular because it was opensource and was the only viable competition to ios. people dont care what kernel it runs. UnlikeABoss No nerd worth their salt would promote an environment that would be a downgrade from Windows. Android was not a downgrade from iOS at any point in time, it had a very equal playing field. There's a difference between promoting a good solid FOSS kernel where possible, and promoting an agenda. m477 Android was not a downgrade from iOS at any point in time By this, I get that you never used Android and iOS side by side in 2009-10. UnlikeABoss You clearly value different things. The hackability alone made it an upgrade through its lifetime. m477 The same can be said for GNU/Linux on desktop. UnlikeABoss No it can't, because hackability =/= app availability. i.e. The hackability on Linux desktop doesn't make it win over it's lack of apps, where that isn't an issue on Android. m477 App availability was horrible in the early days, compared to iOS. Even Symbian had more apps. UnlikeABoss That was fine since the early days didn't consist of using your smartphone for very much, due to under powered hardware. Techies didn't go around saying "use iOS because we can all take selfies and stick filters on it". m477 iOS devices didn't have front cameras until mid 2010. The system was better, faster, smoother, the interface was coesive, there were many more apps, and the jailbreak community, to address the techie audience you like to go on about so much, was very, very good. There were tweaks and modifications that even the wildest Android custom ROM didn't have at the time. Android was objectively a downgrade, as much as Linux was on desktop. UnlikeABoss Calling jailbraik an advantage over a FOSS OS is pretty hilarious. iOS wasn't popular because it was better, it was popular because of the amount of people getting their advice from paid employees in store. "Buy iOS so we get a commission". m477 iPhone was more popular for various reasons: marketing, having 2 years of advantage, and, yes, more marketing. But it was also better than Android, as an OS. What benefit did Android bring, with it being opensource, compared to iOS, even to a "techie"? The dev community was laughable in the early days. Why GNU/Linux on desktop was not promoted by "techies" (which is false) and Android was, even if their shortcomings were identical? destinyhud u live in a dream world. even most dev dont care about kernel. what they care about the dev platform. I am a dev and i dont care for the kernel UnlikeABoss If you're talking from the perspective of an app developer then ofcourse you don't care about the kernel, you care about which platform will make you the most money... destinyhud exactly. no one care what kernel it runs.. all dev care is what platform make money. so who is this nerd who care about kernel if most dont care about the kernel.. yeah very very few.. infact rare like u UnlikeABoss Techie == Technology Enthusiast. You can sit here and tell me that you would use the best dev environment all you want but the truth is if the iOS dev environment was awful you'd still suck it up and use it to make your money. I'm not sure how you can class yourself as an enthusiast at that point. destinyhud ever wonder why no one is up voting u and upvoting many of my comments? because what u say is BS. its that simple. I am up for ditching outdated linux if the new kernal is modern and build for modern devices. most dont care for this very few techies.. i hope this becomes true and linux kernel die.. UnlikeABoss "Ever wonder why Google fanboys upvote pro Google content and not anti-Google content?" No, no I don't wonder that. How dare someone critique a pointless change by Google, causing unnecessary fragmentation. Burn them! destinyhud u must be new here.. look at anti google comments here when they make stupid changes but if they make welcome changes people tend to agree UnlikeABoss No, I've been here a long time and made many anti-Google comments as well as pro-Google. No one in the right mind would cheer on kernel fragmentation other than those that think Google can do no wrong. destinyhud open up ur comments history and let me see if u made pro google comments. i have a feeling u r a troll UnlikeABoss Yeah, this discussion is going no where. You are not the authority here and the idea that you want to browse my history to make sure I fall in line is creepy as hell. Bye. destinyhud lol i see u dont want to open ur comments history. obvious troll m477 outdated linux i hope this becomes true and linux kernel die Woah, wait a second here. Linux is not outdated, and its death would be terrible for everyone. It's just that it's not the most apt kernel for a mobile device. destinyhud maybe not outdated but not the right fit for mobile devices. destinyhud android sucked when compared to ios.. it was a downgrade compared to ios. why did dev promote android and not desktop linux? u reasoning dont even make sense. UnlikeABoss No, it wasn't a downgrade. destinyhud yes, it was back in android initial release. iOS was better and much more polished at that time. but things changed now. UnlikeABoss "Polished" is not a factor that is used to judge a better OS. There are Linux environments that are much more polished than Windows 10, but that doesn't make desktop Linux better. destinyhud it was both polished and runs better than android at that time. polished was not the only one. it was also polished. android only got better later.. i have used android at that time and it sucked big time. UnlikeABoss You are using today's standards to judge it. If you do that, they both sucked. It worked perfectly fine for the basic things people were using it for at the time. destinyhud they both sucked at that time but android sucked more than iOS at that time. SVem26 I like to think I am in the nerd userbase and I don't care what kernel is used.. can you help me understand why it matters? UnlikeABoss Do you want a brand new obscure kernel in thing that holds most of your sensitive details? TipTop I don't want something that dates back to 90s, is full of zero-days and horrible code contributed by nobodies. UnlikeABoss The idea that it is full of zero days is hilarious. You do realize that the majority of Linux exploits are local, right? Unlike Windows. Yes there is obviously code from the 90s, but very, very little of it. Not to mention that age is not a factor in deciding bad code. The idea that old code is bad code shows your inexperience. By that standard, should we dismiss Chrome because of all the exploits being found in code that was written when it first started? Are we going to create brand new software every few years to purge "old code"? Do you have any idea whatsoever how much Linux has actually changed? Do you have any idea how much of this change is because it's considered a "universal" kernel everyone can use and is focusing on? Do you really think splitting the community over onto another kernel will increase security for either of those kernels? There's a little something called code maturity. There's a reason Microsoft has way less exploits in its kernel today than 10 years ago. They didn't write a new kernel from scratch. Sir_Brizz All OSes are full of vulnerabilities and horrible code written by nobodies. If that is your requirement then you must have gone full luddite by now. ihsan ışık Are you implying that Android got popular because of "nerds" who heard it uses the Linux kernel? UnlikeABoss If you are old enough to know the early days of android you'll know that having every single nerd on the internet promoting Android over iOS most certainly helped get the ball rolling. Once it was pushed, it snowballed into what it is today. m477 Sure. It was the nerds on the internet, not the manufacturers with ads everywhere. Most people still don't know their Galaxy runs Android. UnlikeABoss The giant billboards came YEARS afterwards, cmon. m477 Yes, and that's why Android was so unpopular in the early days. UnlikeABoss What? It was massively popular among all techies for being the open source iOS alternative. m477 You are overestimating the "techies" crowd. Even BlackBerryOS was more popular at the time. Only after the Galaxy S it started to grow, and became popular among normal people. UnlikeABoss Not really. We are talking over a decade ago now, there were far less people on the internet and it was far easier for techies to promote products because everyone was asking their "techie" friend what is best. But these days everyone is an "expert" so that's not as much of a thing. m477 Again, you overestimate how many techies there actually were. Your personal experience is anecdotal. Market shares and sell data are objective. Also, over a decade ago Android was still a camera os, and it wasn't public. UnlikeABoss No, I do not. The further back in time you go, the higher the proportion of techies there were using the internet versus others. People were only just starting to look at buying a smartphone, and asking techies what they should buy. m477 Yes, the concentration on the internet of "techies" on the internet was greater. And? What normal user at the time went to the internet, looked at reviews and said "Oh, look! The HTC magic has Linux! This random guy says its good, so I'm gonna buy it!"? You really think that a bunch of "techies">marketing? A guy saying that his toy-looking HTC G1 is better than the iPhone is more effective than billboards and tv ads? Come on, even Windows Mobile was more popular. It took Samsung's aggressive marketing to make Android popular. UnlikeABoss Windows Mobile and BlackBerry were more popular in the enterprise, that's it. The entire discussion is home users. Also I think there's been some confusion. I wasn't implying that techies on the internet were promoting Android on the internet like a marketing department. I was implying that the internet was very much a "social media" platform for techies to communicate where the majority of them would use Android and mocked the use of iOS. The actual "marketing" happened offline when a normal user would ask their "techie" friend for first time buying advice. It is nothing like that today, and the internet is nothing like the techie community it once was. m477 So, what you're saying is that the internet was a circlejerk of Android users. Ok, and? It didn't affected normal users the slightest, iOS was still more popular until Samsung took Android more seriously. The techie friend thing its only your anecdotal experience, it bears no influence on the market, in the grand scheme of things. I'd even argue that Google's very light marketing did much, much more. Also, the mindless techies that recommended half backed devices instead of better alternatives because "Uh, Linux!!" did more harm than good, both to the users and to Android. UnlikeABoss If you read my OP you'll see my original point was that Google has rode the "Android circlejerk" to popularity, and you can debate how much popularity that added as much as you want. The fact remains, it got the ball rolling. Samsung didn't pick it up "just because", it saw that a lot of people were pushing it. There were several OS at the time it could have used, including sticking to its own. Why bother with Android? Maybe because it wanted to see how much market it could take by appealing to techies? However, if you stand back and look at it, how is this any different from "embrace, extend, extinguish"? Google used that "free marketing" and has now decided to use it's massive popularity to push a different product. (Which has failed in the past and will hopefully fail again). Why hate Microsoft for doing that in the past, but we praise Google for doing it? Why are we excited for something we know nothing about that is creating fragmentation? m477 Samsung had used several OSes, it had Windows Mobile and Phone devices, Symbian devices, and proprietary devices, even Palm OS devices IIRC. They used them all. Android had was the easiest to personalise for them, and create a copy of the best selling product, which was the iPhone, and there was an app market, so they tried to release and market their flagship with it, and market it as broadly as Apple. The first Galaxy (the "non S") was was vastly ignored, because it was as little marketed as all their other devices. The techies crowd was insignificant. The free marketing is just as much as Windows 10 gets for incorporating Ubuntu's bash terminal. What you saw is not really important. I saw lots and lots of Windows Phones in 2010 and 11. Many more than Android devices. Every one I knew had one, and if I had to say which OS was the most popular only based on my personal experience, in my smallish city, I'd obviously would say Windows Phone. Why are you so attached to Linux, excluding all possibilities of giving a possibly better solution a try? The community will just fork the AOSP and continue the development of the Linux branch. UnlikeABoss Cmon, we both know Android was not easier for them to customize than simply using their own OS. No one was recommending it, techie or not, no matter how much they marketed. It's only now they are popular they are trying to slip in their own OS, and still failing. I am not attached to Linux despite people using it as an easy scapegoat to dismiss a discussion critiquing almighty Google. We currently have a situation where most kernel developers focus entirely on Linux, making it virtually the universal kernel. Why are we creating pointless fragmentation there? Why divide that community? Do we honestly believe that a divided community can produce a better kernel, or do we love it because Google is doing it? Would we love it if Microsoft did this? m477 The proprietary OS they used at the time was a Java based thing with a flash interface. Hardly able to compete against iOS. It was easier for them to use the "next Symbian" that they could customise as they wanted, and that also had an app market. If they made, say, Bada, before Android become established and popular, and marketed it as much as they did with their Galaxy S, the market would be very different today. The normal user doesn't care what OS their shiny phone runs, as long as there's facebook. I am a GNU/Linux user since the first half of the 2000s, and I've always critiqued Google for using Linux as a kernel on phones. Linux might be the universal kernel, but smartphones need a more streamlined solution. I don't care if it's Google, the MIT, or Richard Stallman in person to do it. I liked WP8 architecture. Fragmentation is not pointless if it brings benefits to the user. TipTop Nobody cares about your FSF agenda. John Q I think the chief reason Google is not using Linux is that they want a real-time OS (RTOS). Linux is at best a "soft" RTOS, possessing a real-time scheduler but this is still not nearly as real-time as an actual RTOS should be. It would take a very large effort to do that for Linux so it makes sense that Google would want to make their own kernel that they can have full control over. UnlikeABoss Let's ignore the fact that Linux is used in real time car systems for a moment. Could you elaborate on why you think Google would want/need a RTOS on their smartphones? M6 The kernel they're using, 'magenta', is opened source. So who cares if they're using linux or not? Does everyone have to use linux? UnlikeABoss No it doesn't have to be Linux. But who else will use Magenta? Probably no one. So why are we fragmenting the kernel space further? Why would you choose an immature kernel for something as valuable (your data) as your smartphone. Would you trust that? I would much rather developers continue focusing on a single kernel. WesleySmalls But wouldn't Magenta be this single kernel? UnlikeABoss If everyone decided to ditch Linux and focus purely on Magenta as the universal kernel, yes. Will that happen? WesleySmalls Could be, just not overnight. The market was already fairly well developed when Linux arrived in 1991, yet it still managed to become a very, if not the most, important player in the market. It's certainly possible, it will just require proper investment(and neglect of their alternate platforms) and patience to make it work M6 That's some straight up communist shit right there. Let's just work on one thing, because we only need one thing, everything else is redundant! Let's not allow other people to do the same thing in a different way, because competition totally doesn't spur innovation at all. WORPspeed So Andromeda definitely dead or still happening? sleepinlight Pretty sure this IS Andromeda, or at least a part of it. Andromeda was never an official name for anything, it was just the internal project name for some sort of new and/or merged OS. WORPspeed I thought Andromeda specifically referred to merging Android and Chrome OS. So is that specific merger dead or on life-support? John Q Nah, the Android/Chrome merger was just speculation from what Andromeda seemed to be. There was never any concrete evidence to imply that Andromeda was a merger. WORPspeed To quote Androidpolice : "So please, when you see Fuchsia mentioned, or speculation that it "is" Andromeda, know that it is just that: speculation. Last we heard from sources we consider extremely reliable, Android was the basis of Andromeda, and Andromeda would see its commercial debut on a new Pixel laptop later this year. It is possible Google has changed plans around Andromeda, that the initiative itself may have even been scrapped. Though, we have no reason to think so - it's more that we don't know, and haven't heard anything about Andromeda in quite some time." http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/02/15/speculation-around-googles-fuchsia-os-and-andromeda-is-creating-confusion-and-misinformation/ WORPspeed http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/02/15/speculation-around-googles-fuchsia-os-and-andromeda-is-creating-confusion-and-misinformation/ That makes them seem very separate Srujan https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/e7fda716dfcfdca76e200e51a9c9144c72e183c7e76d36b910c20ee0931aee79.gif destinyhud if this replaces android rather than having 2 separate codebase, I am all up for it. splitting the android community is dangerous senor_heisenberg Well if this does end up being what replaces Android or what Android evolves into, I just hope my apps and whatnot are compatible. Ain't got the time or money to be investing into another ecosystem. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman That's a tricky, double-edged sword. I can't fathom they would not support the old apps, or at least the vast majority of them, for exactly that reason. But in doing so it will likely be held back at least slightly from what it can/should be. Backward-compatibility tends to hold everything back. What I'd wager is we won't see this until hardware's powerful enough to make emulating the old system in a VM relatively cheap and easy, with back-end Play Store penalties to developers who don't shift to the new app models, and then slow phase-outs in stages of the older functionality and support until the new OS is running exclusively its own setup. senor_heisenberg That sounds good. Randy Gindy I think Google porting the Android Run-time to Chrome OS was to see if they could do it. morteum This is old news, I'm waiting for Fuchsia 2.0 Barracuda. /s marcusmarcus2 What if they aren't going by Animal names in general but by mammal names. I'd skip the Fuchsia 2.0 Bandicoot. It will probably be "Crash" prone. Alfonso Surroca Three operating systems is not nearly enough. We need at least two more announced at I/O.

Suicide_Note There is no update problem. Nexus/Pixels run the latest and greatest. OEMs who mess with the OS give their customers severely delayed updates. pfmiller Nexus and Pixels run the latest and greatest for two years. Nobody would accept this OS update situation if it was on a desktop OS. MJ Thank God it's phones we are talking about and not a desktop PC. marcusmarcus2 That is exactly why Windows XP lasted only a couple years before all computers updated to Windows 7... Seriously though. I'm fine with only getting Android version upgrades phones for 2 years. But they really need to extend out security updates beyond 3 years. Suicide_Note This isn't a desktop OS, not to mention people tend to change phones much more often than their desktops. pfmiller Sure it's not a desktop OS, but no sense pretending that what we have leaves nothing to be desired. And sure people change their phones more often that their desktops, but there's absolutely no reason to change every 2 years. Doby Gillis Which is a problem, Einstein. Suicide_Note Not if you're a Nexus/Pixel owner, Dilbert. Randy Gindy I would generally say there is. Android phones are not supported for nearly as long as an iPhone. The reason being that the chip set manufacturers do not release new drivers. Shelly-Man Vol 2 It's looks pretty neat for a development stage. Rami Well Android has to reach Z someday. In the case, Hello Fuchsia! marcusmarcus2 Those split-screens will be really useful for running of of Google's different messaging apps. Hopefully OS's aren't the new messaging apps of Google.

You can install it just as any other apk WesleySmalls "Will it be neglected to Internet-of-Things devices and other basic hardware, or will it some day replace Android altogether?" Neither, this is just a side project many developers use to test and work out the feasability of a variety of things. Android is a very well developed environment, and replacing it whole is simply a no-go. Things will just gradually evolve, as they have already done with Dalvik being replaced by ART, for example. Sir_Brizz I don't think you're wrong, but it would be in Google's best interest to start building a non-JVM runtime that apps can run inside with a native language that Google has 100% full control over like Go or Dart. Тарас Мукин 1. This is definetelly Chat UI! It came from Telegram bots and whatsoever, and it is so smart of Google to be developing it now.

Lol Cyber Jethro I personally think this is for embedded systems like shopping kiosks or other customer service applications. Zach Mauch "Will it be neglected to Internet-of-Things devices and other basic hardware" Did you mean "relegated", not "neglected"? PVL_93_RU Those "stories" on the "home screen" look like they'd fit perfectly for a kiosk-type display, where you have a lot of space to work with JG Fuchsia is a purple-y pink color. T-Mobile's color is Magenta, a slightly different purple-y pink color T-Mobile is rumored to be looking into launching their own phone... Coincidence??? Almost certainly, without a doubt yes... But consider... T-Mobile also launched the first Android phone... yoloswag Inspired by the messaging team, Google wants to start working on a 2nd operating system. JG Magenta is designed for "modern phones and modern personal computers with fast processors, non-trivial amounts of ram with arbitrary peripherals doing open ended computation." Modern personal computers huh? I've been interested in Google packing ChromeOS into a LiveCD type set up we could test/install on our own computers... (*Yes, I know of Chromium, haven't tried it yet... But I would prefer it coming direct from Google, faster updates and all that). It could be interesting to try out another of Google's OSs without having to fork over several hundred for new hardware... The only problem would be drivers to support the various hardware. If not modified too much, ChromeOS could possibly use the original Gentoo Linux drivers. But with Fuchsia using its own unique kernel... That might throw things off a bit... I know a few less tech-savey individuals who would probably be more comfortable if the same OS powered their phone, tablet and desktop (should Google opt to replace Android with Fuchsia). Especially if it could run both Android apps and Chrome extensions natively. Zxyon Rhysivz This could be the beginning of distros for Android. *Imagines Ubuntu Android* Peter World Citizen This will run in parallel with Android.

Google’s rocky road: Fake news, extremist videos & bad search results [Podcast] In this week's podcast, we discuss Google's efforts to combat hyperpartisan and extremist content, fake news and misinformation on YouTube and in its search results. Matt McGee on May 5, 2017 at 2:05 pm More Google is having a rough year. Extremist and hyperpartisan videos have made the term “brand safety” mainstream, as major advertisers pulled their ads from YouTube. Poor search results, like the featured answers for questions like “Are women evil?” or “Did the holocaust happen?” have shined a light on Google’s struggles to identify authoritative sources that can answer searcher questions. The company’s image has taken a hit. But Google has started fighting back. It’s put new policies in place to govern allowable speech on YouTube, and it’s changed how it’ll penalize publishers whose videos get overrun with unacceptable user comments. It’s also taking steps to improve its search experience, like being more explicit in explaining when it might remove search suggestions and also inviting users to flag troublesome search answers. Is that enough? In this week’s episode of Marketing Land Live, I put that question to our very own Danny Sullivan and Ginny Marvin, both of whom have closely covered Google’s difficulties in these areas. We talk about Project Owl, the new YouTube policies and much more. This week’s show runs about 32 minutes. You can listen here or use the link below to subscribe via your favorite podcast service.

Waymo, Google's self-driving car firm, produced the first cars with no pedals, steering wheel or driver Today, it's possible to buy a car that can park itself, stay in a lane and maintain a constant speed.  Self-driving car technology is developing rapidly and many companies are already testing their models.  For example, Waymo, Google's self-driving car firm, has undergone 200 hours of extreme-weather testing and plans to have the vehicles on public roads in 2017, according to Waymo's CEO Jon Krafcik.   Tesla's Model S and Model X vehicles with new autonomous capability hardware are already in production.  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next BACTERIA could mean the end of the pothole: Radical self...

Share this article Share 11 shares It's likely that we will soon see full automated cars on the market, but will people be willing to pay for the technology? A team of researchers based at Cornell University and led by Dr Ricardo Daziano conducted a study to find out how car manufacturers and policy makers sure the technology is rolled out to roads smoothly.  'Automation of personal transportation is becoming a reality at a faster pace than anticipated,' said Dr. Daziano. 'To plan for and analyze the large impacts of automation, policymakers and car manufacturers need to understand the market.  'Our study is an initial attempt to quantify how households currently perceive and economically value automated vehicle technologies.' The team used hypothetical scenarios to predict what people would pay for cars with self-driving features.  They asked 1,260 people across the US questions about hypothetical vehicles in terms of their price and features, such as energy efficiency, charging time (for electric cars) and automated navigation systems.  Then, the participants had to choose between cars in a series of choice experiments.  The researchers developed models that show consumer demand for automation is roughly split equally between high, modest and no demand. A row of Google self-driving Lexus cars at a Google event outside the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California They said that this highlights the importance of considering flexible preferences for new vehicle technologies.  'Forecasting the transition to an automated transportation reality is a complex task that requires flexible mathematical models of human behavior as well as an understanding of the likely technology developments and possible business models that may emerge,' Dr. Daziano said.  'On the one hand, I feel particularly attracted to this interplay of economic modeling with technology innovation.  'On the other hand, I don't enjoy driving so I look forward to cars that will drive (themselves) for me, and I would like to have an insider's view of when this could happen.' GOOGLE'S CARS BECOME WAYMO  Google turned its self-driving car division into a new company called Waymo, in December 2016. And it revealed the vehicles it will use - specially developed Crysler minivans. The hybrid vehicles are expected to form part of Google's ridesharing service, and are already being tested in California.  As we get fully self-driving cars ready for the road, we'll need more types of vehicles to refine and test our advanced driving software,' Waymo CEO Jon Krafcik wrote. 'That's why in May we teamed up with FCA to work on adding 100 self-driving Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid minivans to Waymo's fleet. 'With this great new minivan on the road in our test markets, we'll learn how people of all ages, shapes, and group sizes experience our fully self-driving technology.' The team has spent six months on the joint program. Using several of our early prototype minivans, we've already run a gamut of tests, including over 200 hours of extreme-weather testing,' Krafcik said. 'Before starting production in October, we'd put these early vehicles through their paces at our own test track in California, and FCA's Chelsea Proving Grounds in Chelsea, MI and their Arizona Proving Grounds in Yucca, AZ. We're looking forward to having these new vehicles on public roads in 2017.' To underscore his point, Krafcik revealed the project had hit a key milestone in the journey to having fully autonomous cars cruising around public roads. In a trip taken in October 2015 , a pod-like car with no steering wheel and brake pads drove a legally blind passenger around neighborhoods in Austin, Texas without another human in the vehicle. It marked the first time one of the project's cars had given a passenger a ride without a human on hand to take control of a self-driving car if something went wrong.  Read more: Are consumers willing to pay to let cars drive for them?

Play it now! more GADGET REVIEWS Is this the ultimate party speaker? MailOnline puts Sony's XB40 to the test Sony SRS-XB40 has a built-in multi-coloured line light, speaker lights and a flashing strobe. It features 24 hours of battery life and claims to be a 'mini-disco on the move'. But does it live up to the claim? Samsung's Galaxy S8: A hefty price tag and a dumb personal assistant Samsung's new Galaxy S8 phone is stunning, but its $100 price hike is hard to swallow. Overall the S8 is for those who want elegance - and are willing to pay for it. Affordable, robust and surprisingly responsive: Samsung's Galaxy A5 With the eagerly awaited Galaxy S8 having been pushed back, South Korea-based Samsung has plugged the gap with the Samsung Galaxy A5, a high-end device with a mid-range price tag. Is it really worth paying £280 for Nintendo's Switch? MailOnline's verdict While the design is impressive and easy to use, the game line up is disappointing. Google's Daydream: The $79 headset that could bring VR to the masses Google's $79 headset is superb in terms of hardware - but is currently let down by a lack of apps. However, it has absolutely huge potential to finally bring VR to the masses. Welcome Home: Google's $130 smart speaker Google's smart Home speaker still has a lot of learning to do, and loses out to Amazon's Echo in some areas - but has incredible potential 'Not quite an iPhone replacement': Google's Pixel phone Google's Pixel handset is good, and boasts an amazing camera and smart assistant. It's the king of the Android handsets - but still not great. Xbox One S review: Console that will make your 4K TV shine Microsoft's Xbox One S has shrunk the giant console by 40%, and is stunningly designed console with 4K HDR capabilities - but comes with some caveats. The $1,000 wireless speaker that really IS worth the price: Naim Mu-so Qb review Naim's incredible Mu-So Qb takes you back to the good old days - where the music captivates and enthralls, rather that simply being something in the background. The hi-tech $2,000 spin bike that really could change your life Peloton's hi-tech bike lets you stream live and on demand rides to your home - and it's one of the best examples of fitness technology out there - at a price. Apple's new 9.7inch iPad Pro is a powerhouse you can take anywhere Apple has added a few improvements to the smaller version, creating a tablet that is astonishingly powerful, but, unlike its big brother, is something you'll be able to carry everywhere. Speaker that looks as good as its sounds: B&W Zeppelin Wireless review It's not cheap, but the $699 (£500) Zeppelin Wireless is perfect for the design conscious music fan. The best all in one wireless speaker you'll ever hear: Naim Mu-so review It might not be a name familiar to the US market, but Naim is a legendary British brand hoping to make a splash with the American launch of its $1499 Mu:So speaker. From the Makers of Candy Crush Farm Heroes Saga, the #4 Game on iTunes.

Photographer: James MacDonald/Bloomberg Larry Page's dream of using technology to fix cities may come to Canada first.  Sidewalk Labs LLC, the urban innovation unit of Page's Alphabet Inc., has applied to develop a 12-acre strip in downtown Toronto, responding to a recent city agency request for proposals, according to two people familiar with the plans. Details of the proposal are private, but these people said the bid fits with the company's ambition to create a connected, high-tech city or district from scratch. Last year, the company began talking openly about building a theoretical urban zone "from the internet up," with some of the same tools and principles that have fueled success at many tech companies. Before applying in Toronto, Sidewalk Labs discussed creating a district in Denver and Detroit with Alphabet executives, according to the people. They asked not to be identified discussing private plans. In a speech last week at the Smart Cities NYC conference, Sidewalk Labs Chief Executive Officer Dan Doctoroff said the firm is exploring development of a "large-scale district." “I’m sure many of you are thinking this is a crazy idea," Doctoroff said, according to news website StateScoop. “We don’t think it’s crazy at all. People thought it was crazy when Google decided to connect all the world’s information. People thought it was crazy to think about the concept of a self-driving car.” A representative for Sidewalk Labs confirmed Doctoroff's speech but declined to comment further. Doctoroff was CEO of Bloomberg LP and worked as deputy major of New York City when Bloomberg founder Michael Bloomberg was mayor.  Canadian officials set up Waterfront Toronto, a public corporation designed to revitalize a 2,000-acre downtown plot, in 2001. Earlier this year, the agency requested proposals for part of that area: a new "community" called Quayside to be developed with a private "innovation and funding partner." Quayside would be "a testbed for emerging technologies, materials and processes that will address these challenges and advance solutions that can be replicated in cities worldwide," the city wrote in its invitation.  Andrew Hilton, a spokesman for Waterfront Toronto, declined to comment on the applicants for Quayside or its funding structure. The agency plans to identify its development partner by June at the earliest, according to its proposal document. Formed two years ago, Sidewalk Labs was among the first independent units of Google before it turned into the Alphabet holding company. So far, the most visible project is LinkNYC, a network of ad-supported Wi-Fi kiosks in New York City run by Intersection, a Sidewalk Labs investment. But the vision extends well beyond corner kiosks and other "smart city" efforts that typically involve selling software and infrastructure to local agencies facing budget pressures. Doctoroff has spoken often about how technology like autonomous transit, high-speed internet, embedded sensors and ride-sharing services could transform urban life. He's also hinted at tech's ability to overhaul zoning rules and control housing costs, a particular interest of Alphabet's Page.  Exclusive insights on technology around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology. Sign Up Sidewalk Labs has discussed creating an entire micro-city or district that could showcase the company's ideas for urban planning. At the conference last week, Doctoroff said the plans were still in the "feasibility" phase. It hasn't spoken publicly about its business model, beyond ad revenue from the New York Wi-Fi kiosks. Intersection, the company behind them, is expanding those to London this year. Groups involved in urban redevelopment projects, like Toronto's Quayside, typically try to recoup investments with real estate gains later.  Toronto could be a lucrative home for Sidewalk's urban experiment because of the city's rapid growth, surging home prices and willingness to embrace new technology. It's also trying to attract more investment from the U.S. On Monday, Uber Technologies Inc. announced it is starting a new lab for its autonomous vehicle program in the Canadian metropolis. -- With assistance from Gerrit De Vynck Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Hong Kong Free Press reports: “We’re experiencing a block and we’re deeply sorry,” a Tencent official said on a company microblog. “Russian regulations say online service providers have to register with the government but WeChat doesn’t have the same understanding (of the rules),” the official added. A spokesman for Russia’s telecoms watchdog Roskomnadzor said the messaging service “did not provide its contact information for the register of information distribution organisations.” “We are sending letters to iTunes and Google Play to block the app. We await a reaction. If it does not follow, access to the messenger will be limited through telecom providers,” Vadim Ampelonsky told state-run RIA Novosti Friday. [Source] From the South China Morning Post: Access to WeChat was restricted on the basis of Article 15.4 of the law on information, information technologies and information security, according to Roskomnadzor, officially known as the Federal Service for Supervision in the Sphere of Telecom, Information Technologies and Mass Communications. The law, introduced in 2014, requires foreign messaging services, search engines and social networks to store the personal data of Russian users inside Russia. Sites that breach the law are added to a blacklist and internet providers are obliged to block access. The law prompted criticism from internet companies but entered into force in late 2015. Cheng Yijun, a Russian-relations expert at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said there we no signs that the incident was politically motivated. “The issue should be a company legal or commercial event rather than [about the] Sino-Russian relationship.” [Source] Josh Horwitz at Quartz further reports on the spotty implementation of the Russian internet regulations that WeChat may have run afoul of: A spokesperson for Roskomnadzor told AFP that the agency blocked WeChat because it did not provide its “contact details” to the register. However, the true cause of the block likely lies in a Russian law passed in 2014 requiring all foreign internet companies to store Russian user data on servers located inside Russia, a requirement China has also imposed. To date, few major internet companies have complied with the requirement and have faced no consequences as a result. Google and Facebook remain unaffected by the law and continue to operate normally in Russia as they do in most other countries. But not every company has gotten off easy. In 2016 Russian authorities blocked access to LinkedIn, which at the time had 6 million users in the country. In March, Roskomnadzor told media that LinkedIn submitted a letter to the agency saying it had no intentions of storing domestic user data on domestic servers, which “confirmed its lack of interest in working with the Russian market.” It also tweeted out a message announcing LinkedIn’s “death” in Russia. […] Since then, Russia has acted more aggressively against foreign internet companies operating in Russia. Early last week it published a notice announcing that several chat apps, including Blackberry Messenger and Japan’s Line, had been blocked. The WeChat block in particular rings of irony, since China itself is known for imposing tough regulations on foreign internet companies, and enforcing them with ever more vigor. Facebook, Google, YouTube, and Twitter, which operate in Russia largely without issue, remain blocked in China primarily due to qualms about freedom of information. Over the past few years the Chinese government has also blocked Instagram, Snapchat, Flickr, Line, Dropbox, iCloud, Pinterest, and several established news media, like The New York Times. [Source] While some insist the blocking is due to commercial and legal concerns, Russia has been shoring up its capacity for limiting internet access inside the country, with guidance from the Chinese government. A year ago, China’s Cyberczar Lu Wei and “Father of the Great Firewall” Fang Binxing traveled to Russia to participate in the 7th International Safe Internet forum. Lu Wei’s successor, Xu Lin, also paid a visit to Russia this year: China's top internet censor is speaking at a Russian Orthodox Christian web censorship forum. pic.twitter.com/uiAPtKikZQ — max seddon (@maxseddon) April 26, 2017 Last year, Presidents Xi and Putin signed a bilateral agreement touching on several internet-related issues and Moscow has begun to directly incorporate Beijing’s innovations on internet control, including development of the “Red Web,” which includes similar elements to the Great Firewall. Last month, Emily Parker wrote in Slate that Russia is “trying to copy China’s approach to internet censorship,” but that it is “probably too late”: Moscow clearly admires Beijing’s approach. Last year, former Chinese internet czar Lu Wei and Great Firewall architect Fang Binxing were invited to speak at a forum on internet safety. The Russians were apparently hoping to learn Chinese techniques for controlling the web. Russia has already taken a page or two from China’s playbook. While Facebook and Twitter remain accessible in Russia, at least for now, a Russian court ruled to ban LinkedIn, apparently for breaking rules that require companies to store personal data about Russian citizens inside the country. This could be a warning to companies like Google, Twitter, and Facebook, which risk being blocked in Russia if they refuse to follow such rules. Both Russia and China have made clear that they wish to regulate the internet as they see fit, without outside interference. Chinese President Xi Jinping has stressed the importance of internet sovereignty, which essentially means that individual countries should have the right to choose their own model of cyber governance. Putin has taken this idea one step further by calling the internet a “CIA project.” By this logic, Russia needs to proactively protect its own interests in the information sphere whether by cracking down on online dissent or using the internet to spread its own version of events. […] Russian blogger Elia Kabanov believes that YouTube is now too big to block. “I doubt the Kremlin will go there,” he said. “They blocked LinkedIn mostly because it was a niche site in Russia and nobody cared. And of course the government propaganda machine is using YouTube a lot, so it wouldn’t make any sense to block it.” If they try to take down protest announcements on platforms on YouTube, Kabanov says, new ones will appear. “I really can’t see the way for the Kremlin to implement the Chinese model now: Everything is too connected, their own agencies are using all these services.” [Source] Meanwhile, Global Voices gathered responses to Russia’s blocking of WeChat from Chinese netizens, which “ranged from humorous levity to solidarity.” Share this: Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) May 8, 2017 2:50 PM Posted By: Sophie Beach Categories: China & the World, Economy, Information Revolution, Sci-Tech Tags: exporting censorship, Internet regulation, Russia relations, Russia trade, WeChat Related Stories 2017.04.27 Sun Liping (孙立平): Between Civilization and Barbarism 2017.04.19 Qiao Mu: “I Quit Because I Don’t Want a Work Unit” 2017.04.18 “Hollywood Can’t Exist Without China” 2017.04.13 WeChat Filters Images Related to Rights Lawyer Crackdown 2017.04.10 Badiucao: Travel Ban on Wife of Detained Taiwan Activist 2017.04.07 Charting the Rise of a Global Information Power 2017.04.06 Person of the Week: Wang Wusi 2017.03.28 Books, WeChat Posts Behind Taiwan Activist’s Detention? 2017.02.10 Ren Zhiqiang’s Gagging Hailed as Key Achievement 2017.01.31 Minitrue: Delete Reports of Billionaire’s Abduction 2016.12.21 New Rules Limit User-Generated Content 2016.11.23 Facebook Accused of Building Censorship Tools for China 2016.11.22 Microsoft’s Chinese Chatbot Encounters Sensitive Words 2016.11.03 Exporting Propaganda, from Cooption to Censorship 2016.10.18 Netflix Gives Up on China as Facebook Presses On 2016.10.15 China’s New Media Pushing Political Boundaries 2016.09.07 Censors Hit Family Planning Debate, Real Estate Rumors 2016.09.06 “I Heard Hangzhou Closed for the G20, So I Tried to Go” 2016.08.05 China’s Tech Firms Flip “Copycat” Image 2016.07.29 The West Kowtows to China Through Self-Censorship CDT Highlights Country of the Week: West Korea Jiang Xue (江雪): You Look Like an Enemy of the State Translation: “I Am Fan Yusu” (Part 1) Minitrue: Guo Wengui is a Sensitive Political Event Book of the Week: “Harbinger of History” CDT for iPhone & iPad CDT Chinese HighlightsMy Tweets CDT on TwitterMy Tweets From the Archives Video Performance: 2009 Go China!

But in a letter to the European Union, chief executives from European companies including Spotify, Deezer and Rocket Internet said the mobile giants are abusing their size within the market, Business Insider reported.  While Google and Apple aren’t called out by name, the letter writers specifically highlighted mobile operating ecosystems, app stores and search engines they claim exhibited anti-competitive behaviors. As IDC noted, Apple iOS and Google Android maintain more than 90 percent of the global smartphone marketshare. Read: SoundCloud Vs Spotify Vs Pandora: Which Music Service Has That Better Pricing, Plan The group also blasted companies with “online platforms” that allow them to become de facto gatekeepers, which encourages practices like biased search rankings and preferences for their own services or products. As the writers note in the full letter: "When working well, major online platforms – be they mobile operating systems, app stores, search engines, marketplaces or social media platforms – are gateways to the digital economy: They enable consumers to access innovative services, they spur innovation and help small businesses and start-ups reach new markets, and they drive investment, growth and employment. "Notwithstanding, the very nature of online platforms – be it their sheer and growing scale and reach, the concentration of market power in a limited number of platforms, the tendency toward 'winner takes all' market dynamics and their already substantial and increasing impact on European citizens’ lives and across all aspects of the economy – requires careful consideration and response from policymakers." The letter comes ahead of the European Commission’s upcoming May 10 review of the Digital Single Market, an EU initiative that focuses on consistent digital regulation and policy among EU members. The CEO group said it hopes the commission will “to pursue a pro-growth, pro-consumer, balanced but targeted, legislative framework for online platform business-to-business (B2B) practices.” The commission is also expected to introduce new policies aimed at adjusting how Apple and Google can work with companies that rely on their app stores, Business Insider reported. Read: Spotify Job Listings Hint At Possible Hardware Like Wearables In the past, Spotify has tussled with Apple over its App Store policies. Apple traditionally takes a 30 percent cut of in-app transactions — including subscription charges — and Spotify has argued the percentage is onerous to its bottom line. Recode reported Spotify also sent a letter to Apple last June arguing Apple’s rejection of a Spotify app update was “causing grave harm to Spotify and its customers” and alleged the company was favoring its own Apple Music service over competitors like Spotify.

(Photo: Peter Byrne/ZUMA Press/Newscom) An oil and gas drilling advocacy group published an open letter to Google asking the search engine giant to consider “purging or demoting” websites spreading misinformation about hydraulic fracturing. Google rewrote its search engine algorithm to bury “fake news” websites in the wake of the 2016 presidential election. Now the industry-funded Texans for Natural Gas wants Google to include anti-fracking websites. “We believe many of the most prominent anti-fracking websites have content that is misleading, false, or offensive – if not all three,” the group wrote in an open letter to Google published Monday. “As a result, we urge you to consider purging or demoting these websites from your algorithm, which in turn will encourage a more honest public discussion about hydraulic fracturing, and oil and natural gas development in general,” the group wrote. Google raters “assess search results — to flag web pages that host hoaxes, conspiracy theories, and what the company calls ‘low-quality’ content,” Bloomberg reported in April. Google and Facebook both were heavily criticized for allowing “fake news” to taint the presidential election. Fracking involves injecting large amounts of water, mixed with some chemicals and sand, deep underground to unlock vast reserves of oil and natural gas. The drilling technique sparked an energy boom, but riled up environmentalists who saw it as a threat to the planet. Texans for Natural Gas argue that environmental groups have put out plenty of false information about fracking. The Sierra Club, for example, claims on its website that “[f]racking has contaminated the drinking water of hundreds of thousands of Americans.” It cites no evidence to back up this charge. The Environmental Protection Agency released its final study on fracking’s impacts on groundwater in late 2016, and found no widespread evidence that fracking was contaminating groundwater. “While the number of identified cases of drinking water contamination is small, the scientific evidence is insufficient to support estimates of the frequency of contamination,” Thomas Burke, the former deputy assistant administrator at EPA, told reporters in December. In another example, Sierra Club Executive Director Michael Brune said fracking was harming newborn babies, pointing to a study he thought found such an association. The 2015 study in question, however, did not make that finding. Study co-author Dr. Bruce Pitt of the University of Pittsburgh said it’s “important to stress that our study does not say that these pollutants caused the lower birth weights.” Some environmentalists have gone even further. Sharon Wilson of Earthworks compared fracking to “rape.” “It is a violation of justice and it is despoiling the land,” Wilson wrote in a 2015 blog post. “Victims usually suffer PTSD.” “Claims made by the radical environmentalist campaign against hydraulic fracturing are protected by the First Amendment,” Texans for Natural Gas wrote to Google, adding: Groups that wish to peddle misleading information about oil and natural gas are fully within their rights to do so. Many of the groups engaging in anti-fracking advocacy have devoted significant resources to Search Engine Optimization (SEO), and as a result they receive significant web traffic. But that is no reason for Google to reward such misinformation with its powerful search engine.

In an effort to streamline G-Suite, its cloud-based enterprise collaboration platform, Google Inc. will be disabling Gchat on June 26 and replacing it with Hangouts, G-Suite’s video, phone call, and instant messaging platform. “We realize these updates may be an inconvenience, so we aimed to minimize disruption and help you navigate the changes where possible,” an unidentified G Suite team representative wrote in a March 24 blog. “These updates will help us focus and prioritize features that will improve the entire G Suite user experience for everyone.” The author’s own Gchat list, which he conveniently retained until writing this story. The changes have been a long time coming: Google has made no secret of its efforts to streamline Hangouts, which was originally released as a Gchat replacement back in 2013, though Gmail users retained access to Gchat, and by many accounts continued to use it. In Gchat’s place, Google has quietly released two versions of Hangouts: the Slack-like Hangouts Chat and Skype for Business-like Hangouts Meet. Gmail users still relying on Gchat have been notified of the changes in recent weeks (right), accompanied by a prompt inviting them to switch to Hangouts, alongside a warning that the change will be forced upon them if they don’t take advantage. Meanwhile, the two mobile analogues to Gchat are going through transitions of its own: the legacy Google Talk Android app, which was replaced in the Play Store with the Hangouts app in 2013, will stop functioning; and starting on May 22, the Hangouts app will no longer support SMS messages, with users encouraged to text using the native Android Messages app instead.

Google has revealed that it’ll launch an Android O Beta Program “soon.” The news comes from Google’s official Android Beta Program page, which has been updated to say that the Android Nougat beta is now complete. An Android O developer preview launched back in mid-March, but that early release was meant for devs to begin trying out the new features that’ll be included with Android O. This upcoming Android O Beta Program should be more consumer-friendly as Google works out the bugs of its update before the public release later this year. There’s no timeframe on when the Android O Beta Program will actually kick off, but it’s possible that it’ll launch at Google I/O next week or shortly thereafter. Google has said that it’ll talk about Android O at I/O next week, and so a major stage like that could be a way to reveal more info about Android O and announce the launch of the new beta program.

Google's "Fuchsia" operating system is taking shape with a new design Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/08 10:01am PDTMay 8, 2017 29 Plus 1 on G+ 243 Share on Facebook 78 Share on Twitter Total Shares350 Development Google News We first talked about Fuchsia, a new operating system being developed at Google, back in August (in fact, it was my first post here). At the time, there wasn't much to get excited about besides the potential - it only had a command-line interface. Now the project has a snazzy new, but clearly unfinished, interface. Summary of Fuchsia First, it's worth going over exactly what Fuchsia is, because it's been quite a while since we talked about it. As opposed to all of Google's other OSes, such as Android and Chrome OS, Fuchsia uses the company's new 'Magenta' kernel instead of Linux. According to the project's documentation, Magenta is designed for "modern phones and modern personal computers with fast processors, non-trivial amounts of ram with arbitrary peripherals doing open ended computation." Magenta's apps and the system interface are written with Google's Flutter SDK, which was initially designed to create cross-platform apps for iOS and Android. Flutter applications are written in Dart, the company's home-grown programming language. All of the system and apps are rendered by 'Escher,' which uses OpenGL or Vulkan to display everything. The 'Armadillo' interface So, on to the new stuff. Fuchsia's system UI has a new name - 'Armadillo.' Ars Technica was able to compile Armadillo into an Android APK, since it is written with the above-mentioned Flutter SDK. The interface doesn't really do anything besides looking pretty, but it does give us an idea of what the finished product could look like. The home screen is a vertical list, with a profile picture, the time, and a battery indicator in the center. Tapping the profile picture brings up something similar to Android's Quick Settings, with toggles for auto-rotate, do not disturb, Airplane Mode, and so on. Above the profile picture is the 'Story,' which the documentation describes as "a set of apps and/or modules that work together for the user to achieve a goal." Currently, this works similarly to Android's Recents screen. Users will also be able to combine stories into a 'Story Cluster.' This is what dragging a Story card into split-screen looks like. Dragging a Story card onto another one triggers a split-screen mode. The user can split an app 50/50 vertically or horizontally, drag in another app for a 33/33/33 split, or even have a tab bar appear for using all the open apps in full-screen. You can even have two apps split vertically next to two other split apps, seen below. This is far more flexible than Android's current multi-tasking functionality, but whether or not it will stay this way is uncertain. Below the profile picture is a panel resembling Google Now, with a placeholder search bar and suggestion cards. Armadillo's documentation says, "a suggestion is a representation of an action the user can take to augment an existing story or to start a new one. [The] suggestion contains enough information to create the visual representation of that concept." So maybe they will work more like an app launcher? It's hard to tell at this point. The Google Now panel, showing Fuchsia's keyboard. Keep in mind that all of this is subject to change, as the Armadillo interface (and the rest of Fuchsia OS) is still under heavy development. It's also hard to tell what Google's plans are for the operating system. Will it be neglected to Internet-of-Things devices and other basic hardware, or will it some day replace Android altogether? We'll have to wait and see.

Suicide_Note Because Google can. Corbin Davenport Ron from Ars Technica put it best: "Fuchsia really seems like a project that asks 'how would we design Android today, if we could start over?' It's a brand-new, Google-developed kernel running a brand-new, Google-developed SDK that uses a brand-new, Google-developed programming language and it's all geared to run Google's Material Design interface as quickly as possible. Google gets to dump Linux and the GPL, it can dump Java and the problems it caused with Oracle, and Google can basically insulate itself from all of Android's upstream projects and bring all the development in-house. Doing such a thing on the scale of Android today would be a massive project." makapav Would it still be open source? Also, what would happen to all the existing APKs? Corbin Davenport Fuchisa is completely open source right now. As for running Android apps, maybe Google will add some kind of stop-gap compatibility layer for running Android apps, like Chrome OS has. destinyhud read the article Suicide_Note Perhaps instead of replacing Android, this will *become* Android, as in Android P or Q? Or be the merger of Android/Chrome? m477 I could see that as Android 10. Definitely too early for P. morteum I wonder if the reason it is called "Armadillo" is because they're starting from A again, but this time they're using animals instead of desserts. Christopher Bement I think it's a smart plan, based on the guess that there's more animals to pick from in the world than tasty desserts. teolinux Ubuntu docet Paul "Tasty treats," not necessarily desserts. That said, armadillos could be a tasty treat. I won't judge. MJ I have heard desserts and candy used before which are wrong but "tasty treats" is a new one for me. To be more accurate, Android names are actually all confectionery foods. A "tasty treat" could be a slice of pizza (aka Android S). LOL Randy Gindy Armadillo is the name of the UI not the OS build itself. Matt74UK Smooth on the inside, crunchy on the outside. Armadillo ! (a few UK people of a certain age may get that). John Doe Idk this is a whole new OS with a new kernel, I doubt this will be done with an OTA update for Android. Mantas Pakėnas Even nowadays, some of Android's new functionality cannot be done via OTA updates (like dual system partitions, forced encryption I believe, etc). To make a completely hard cut sometime when this is ready, and if it's meant to replace Android, is not completely unimaginable. As is updating via OTA. If apple was able to change their file system via OTA, I don't see why changing most of the parts would not be possible. However, nobody aside from Google would do it, almost guaranteed :) Suicide_Note It could likely be done for Pixel devices, and possibly for future devices released after this new version of the OS rolls out. Adrian Meredith quite possibly, after all there no reason it couldn't also run android apps jonathan What they need to do is make this googles very own os for their pixel line and leave android for the oems Suicide_Note Not a chance. To much name recognition with Android for Google to drop it in favor of something else specific to the Pixel lineup. Dallas King Android Z confirmed! Suicide_Note More like Android A for Armadillo. m477 APK plz (no, really, I want a compiled apk the demo) Maxwell “Max” Weinbach https://github.com/fuchsia-mirror/sysui MJ Your link wasn't what the OP asked for... Maxwell “Max” Weinbach the only way to get the APK is to compile it yourself, so I linked to the Github page to a place to download the files to compile. The closest they will get. MJ Than you should have replied there is no known APK or not at all. Maxwell “Max” Weinbach It does not matter that much. I am building the APK right now. Once it is done I will post it. Here is the link on how to compile it. http://www.hotfixit.net/single-post/2017/05/03/How-to-build-Armadillo MJ Don't waste your time... They updated that article with an download of the APK. Maxwell “Max” Weinbach thanks. they just did that. I still compiled it myself though. I will try to get more out of it while I have the Sysui downloaded. Michel R. https://www.androidfilehost.com/?w=files&flid=178684 there you go MJ http://www.hotfixit.net/single-post/2017/05/03/How-to-build-Armadillo Latex beats nudity More of Proprietary code ? No thank you, we already had enough with this Pixel crud. I hope this OS dies quicker or become a chromebook OS. m477 It's open source. Latex beats nudity It's OSS but just like Android It'll be more heavily dependent on the google APIs to make it work. Look at the Pixel SysUI, Just being OSS doesn't make it open source... It's Google's OS not a Linux Based one. If this is going to replace Android It's doomsday on multiple levels. destinyhud billions of people dont care if its running linux kernel or not. maybe very few like u might. do iphone users care why kernel it runs. none of them care. u r just noise tbh Latex beats nudity Billions of people don't code. You are being a kool-aid joke tbh. destinyhud exaclt only few code and even on that few many dont care if it runs linux or not. look at iphone there are more dev there and yet they dont care for kernel. u r delusional in ur own world m477 Android it's already been on a Google-dependent road for years. I don't think this is going to change either way. An Angry Chihuahua https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/magenta/+/master/docs/getting_started.md heres the source code. do some research my dude WitnessG Imagining this running on a Google made processor is exciting. Badouken If this was the OS for the Pixel 2 alongside a Google made processor I think id cry! WitnessG Yeah I don't see this coming out for at least another 2-3 years. Badouken Indeed, but we can dream! ha Suicide_Note Maybe the Pixel 3 or 4 will see the dream become reality. Suicide_Note I'm betting this is what we'll see in a couple years time. As another commenter stated, starting with Armadillo could be Google's way of starting from the beginning (letter A codename), since there's more animal babes to use for each letter than there are dessert names to use. Timothy Vreeland You are getting the furries excited. Nomaan Armadillo should be compared to holo/material and not to dessert names. nachofrand What makes you think Google would be good at making SoCs? They're a software company and don't have the hardware expertise for hardcore ASIC development like that. Granted they can hire people, but in the end, does it matter? They're going to use ARM either way. UnlikeABoss Google fanboyism. The same reason he's excited over a brand new OS. He knows absolutely nothing about it, short of the fact that it will create more fragmentation not only in the OS space, but also the kernel space. So all we know are negative things so far. This is what we call exciting now is it? Why? Just because Google is doing it? If Microsoft made this exact same announcement, would we all be excited? Oh dear. Zsolt V No, because essentially everybody loathes Microsoft. Almost nobody's life would be worse if Microsoft vanished. marcusmarcus2 Don't they design and build their own servers to use for all their websites? Seems like those hardware work well for them. Sergii Pylypenko It's one thing to assemble the server using off-the-shelf components, or even to order a custom motherboard. It's a very different thing to design and manufacture your own chips. marcusmarcus2 I'm not saying it is the same, just that they are not only software experts. Them designing and building the servers show they do have hardware expertise that could assist them in doing the same to chips. Zsolt V Except Google's servers are not assembled from off the shelf components. Haven't been for a few years now. Roy What about TPU? Adrian Vovk Samsung Exynos devices are faster than Snapdragon, iPhones seem underpowered but are extremely snappy, etc. The point is that making both the software and hardware leads to a very fast ecosystem. Also, Google are making the TPU for neural networks nachofrand Yes, as expected. Exynos is faster than Snapdragon on the Galaxy phones, but put an Exynos in another phone...oh wait, you can't. That's the whole entire point. Snapdragon SoCs are general purpose SoCs and can be used for a multitude of phones so they're not custom tuned to every phone individually. Exynos have very specific power rails and the chip is made specifically for that phone. The thing is, sure this is better, but it's marginal and hardly worth talking about. They both use the same ARM architecture so performance gains are pretty negligible. Besides that, this is how Samsung makes money....off of device sales. Google doesn't make money that way. That isn't their business model so at this point it doesn't make sense for them to build their own SoCs when they could just work closer with hardware companies. They make their own TPUs because it aligns with their business model. Adrian Vovk The instruction set doesn't really matter? I can have a 6700k and a 6500k and the 6700k will perform much better even though they are both amd64. With what Google is doing with the Pixels (still as snappy as day one here) I'm pretty sure they can optimize it further than Samsung does. They have made it run smoother in some cases on a chip that they didn't manufacture. If they made their own chip it would allow them many freedoms that they otherwise don't have = easier design of the device. I brought up the TPUs because that is experience in chip manufacturing Jason What makes you say iPhones are under powered ? Apples chips are some of the fastest around and are extremely powerful. Adrian Vovk Specs wise. They have much worse specs on paper and it would lead to a slower experience, except Apple can optimize it because they make both the chip and the OS Stephen Sharp They could use Risc-V and have to pay to license absolutely nothing, while being able to make processors purpose built for their OS Randy Gindy That would be an interesting move. Stephen Sharp Indeed, I really want Risc-V to succeed as an open ISA nachofrand They could. But in my opinion, it's unlikely. Google isn't trying to compete with Samsung and Apple in device sales and that isn't their business model. People using their services so they can show ads is their business model. It doesn't make sense for Google to make their own SoC when others are already doing a good job. Plus, if they went to RISC-V then what? What about the modem? They have to buy a standalone modem from Qualcomm or Intel. Now you have to hire system integration and test engineers to make sure the modem is working with your SoC. Oh and then you need a whole firmware team to control the modem. At that point, buy a full blown SoC with the modem on chip. Stephen Sharp Eh you lost me at "Pixel phone" and all the other hardware they sell. Google also is a Platinum member of the Risc-V foundation, and if there is a direction they are going, more control or less control, I would guess it's "more". But that's just a guess nachofrand Hardware isn't even close to the same thing as asic development. IC design is a different world. Granted they do some custom hardware, but SoCs are a much much larger feat. It's still a possibility they do so, but it doesn't make sense with their current business model imo. Captain On! 1 - Google has stated that they're going to make their own silicon for the Pixels in time. 2 - Google actually owns/operates the world's most powerful quantum computer. They know how to make chips. Randy Gindy That quantum computer was built by DWave though Angel I read (somewhere don’t remember) that they have three different quantum computers systems. One from DWave and two home-produced. From those two, one was made by engineers and not that disimilar from DWave in its operations. The other was made by physicists and uses a different approach. nachofrand 1. I could be wrong, but I've only read that they plan on working closer with chip manufacturers. 2. Google didn't make that computer. Even if they did, quantum is so different those skills don't even translate. Romario Maxwell Google made their own custom ASIC called the Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) for their AI/Machine Learning needs on their cloud platform. See https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2016/05/Google-supercharges-machine-learning-tasks-with-custom-chip.html and https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2017/04/quantifying-the-performance-of-the-TPU-our-first-machine-learning-chip.html nachofrand Sure, although a TPU is just an accelerator. Think of it as the hexagon DSP inside of the Snapdragon SoC. That's like 1/10 of the entire chip. SoC design is much larger. Timothy Vreeland How many examples of hardware design do people have to point out before you stop? Sure the hardware they worked on previously isn't exactly the same... But before they started the hardware they are currently working on, they worked on previous hardware that wasn't the same as what they are doing now. They have shown they are competent in designing many kinds of hardware. Or do you suggest a company can only build one kind of hardware and nothing else for all eternity? How did Samsung make it's current in-house chips? Did they go to ARM college? Have they been making ARM chips since the dawn of time? No. They put together some teams and got to work, so stop blabbing and being negative. sweenish Their AI that finally beat the world's top Go players was running on custom Google chips. It's not like they don't know how. Pixelexel Imagine a Google Pixel with a Google made processor, with Fuschia, with Project Fi with Google WiFi powered by Google fiber. If I'd have this, my life would be complete. Iamsecond Ha, no. A Google processor? Supported for 18 months, then replaced with a new processor that performs half as well (but has stickers.) Does not fully process Android code, because at Google one hand doesn't even know the other hand is there, let alone talk to it. Has 20 cores (only 2 enabled outside US for 'reasons.') Has a dedicated co-processor to enable ads in every app, even those that previously didn't have them. Jason Google can't even get a phone out the door without issues and you want them to make the chips too...lol. I'll pass. UnlikeABoss "In house kernel instead of Linux". Yeah, hopefully this dies in a thousand pits of fire. "Hey Linux guys, you know how you've helped us make billions over the years with a free open source kernel? Well, we were just using you to get the "nerd" userbase. Now we own the market thanks to you guys promoting its use of Linux, we will gradually phase you out." .... m477 I hope not. Linux is not really a kernel made with smartphone in minds. I don't care for being a fan of a kernel over another. UnlikeABoss Yeah. I'd much rather use a brand new untested kernel (and all the teething issues that will come with it) in my smartphone than a mature, stable one that's hacked on by hundreds and thousands of people every month. I mean, it's just a smartphone, we don't need it to be a secure environment, right? Let's just make a nice obscure kernel that no one else will use, and just say "but but it's open source!!! love us because we are Google kk". ... ihsan ışık I'm sorry but it just looks like you are a huge Linux fan and are just against change to me. UnlikeABoss Looks can be deceiving. If you're going to fling around the Linux fanboy term, i'll fling around the Google fanboy term, and that will surely be a nice constructive argument that we will both want to continue. m477 So, in 10 years we should still be using an unoptimised kernel like Linux, because anything newer is, well, newer? UnlikeABoss Yeah, because Linux hasn't changed at all in 10 years... m477 Yes, it changed a lot, and it still has many of the same problems, which are intrinsically bound to its structure. It's not a kernel well suited for mobile devices. UnlikeABoss You think the solution is to throw it out the window and start from scratch? I disagree. I'd much rather continue improving the Linux kernel, simply because of all the eyes it will always have on its code. jonathan Play nice ladies lol m477 With this mentality we wouldn't have Linux at all. Why start anything, while we can continue this other thing which purpose was completely different? A mircokenel is more well suited than a monolitic kernel to a mobile devices, both in terms of performance and security. No matter how much you improve Linux, it will never be a microkernel. UnlikeABoss Smartphones don't need a micro kernel in 2017. You could make that argument 7 years ago. Linux can be compiled with the required drivers just like it always could. m477 I made that argument 7 years ago. They always needed something different from Linux. The fact that specific, even proprietary drivers have to be integrated in the kernel (since Android lacks an abstraction layer) is on of the problems of the interaction Android-Linux. destinyhud why havent the nerds made linux on pc's a bigger market share if they were the one who made android a global leader UnlikeABoss No nerd is promoting Linux on the desktop. All social media used to be full of people promoting Android over iOS, these days there's no need to. destinyhud why havent they promoted desktop?? just wondering why they did for android but not for desktop.. linux on desktop was an underdog for decades. android was not popular because of kernal. android became popular because it was opensource and was the only viable competition to ios. people dont care what kernel it runs. UnlikeABoss No nerd worth their salt would promote an environment that would be a downgrade from Windows. Android was not a downgrade from iOS at any point in time, it had a very equal playing field. There's a difference between promoting a good solid FOSS kernel where possible, and promoting an agenda. m477 Android was not a downgrade from iOS at any point in time By this, I get that you never used Android and iOS side by side in 2009-10. UnlikeABoss You clearly value different things. The hackability alone made it an upgrade through its lifetime. m477 The same can be said for GNU/Linux on desktop. UnlikeABoss No it can't, because hackability =/= app availability. i.e. The hackability on Linux desktop doesn't make it win over it's lack of apps, where that isn't an issue on Android. m477 App availability was horrible in the early days, compared to iOS. Even Symbian had more apps. UnlikeABoss That was fine since the early days didn't consist of using your smartphone for very much, due to under powered hardware. Techies didn't go around saying "use iOS because we can all take selfies and stick filters on it". m477 iOS devices didn't have front cameras until mid 2010. The system was better, faster, smoother, the interface was coesive, there were many more apps, and the jailbreak community, to address the techie audience you like to go on about so much, was very, very good. There were tweaks and modifications that even the wildest Android custom ROM didn't have at the time. Android was objectively a downgrade, as much as Linux was on desktop. UnlikeABoss Calling jailbraik an advantage over a FOSS OS is pretty hilarious. iOS wasn't popular because it was better, it was popular because of the amount of people getting their advice from paid employees in store. "Buy iOS so we get a commission". m477 iPhone was more popular for various reasons: marketing, having 2 years of advantage, and, yes, more marketing. But it was also better than Android, as an OS. What benefit did Android bring, with it being opensource, compared to iOS, even to a "techie"? The dev community was laughable in the early days. Why GNU/Linux on desktop was not promoted by "techies" (which is false) and Android was, even if their shortcomings were identical? destinyhud u live in a dream world. even most dev dont care about kernel. what they care about the dev platform. I am a dev and i dont care for the kernel UnlikeABoss If you're talking from the perspective of an app developer then ofcourse you don't care about the kernel, you care about which platform will make you the most money... destinyhud exactly. no one care what kernel it runs.. all dev care is what platform make money. so who is this nerd who care about kernel if most dont care about the kernel.. yeah very very few.. infact rare like u UnlikeABoss Techie == Technology Enthusiast. You can sit here and tell me that you would use the best dev environment all you want but the truth is if the iOS dev environment was awful you'd still suck it up and use it to make your money. I'm not sure how you can class yourself as an enthusiast at that point. destinyhud ever wonder why no one is up voting u and upvoting many of my comments? because what u say is BS. its that simple. I am up for ditching outdated linux if the new kernal is modern and build for modern devices. most dont care for this very few techies.. i hope this becomes true and linux kernel die.. UnlikeABoss "Ever wonder why Google fanboys upvote pro Google content and not anti-Google content?" No, no I don't wonder that. How dare someone critique a pointless change by Google, causing unnecessary fragmentation. Burn them! destinyhud u must be new here.. look at anti google comments here when they make stupid changes but if they make welcome changes people tend to agree UnlikeABoss No, I've been here a long time and made many anti-Google comments as well as pro-Google. No one in the right mind would cheer on kernel fragmentation other than those that think Google can do no wrong. destinyhud open up ur comments history and let me see if u made pro google comments. i have a feeling u r a troll UnlikeABoss Yeah, this discussion is going no where. You are not the authority here and the idea that you want to browse my history to make sure I fall in line is creepy as hell. Bye. destinyhud lol i see u dont want to open ur comments history. obvious troll m477 outdated linux i hope this becomes true and linux kernel die Woah, wait a second here. Linux is not outdated, and its death would be terrible for everyone. It's just that it's not the most apt kernel for a mobile device. destinyhud maybe not outdated but not the right fit for mobile devices. destinyhud android sucked when compared to ios.. it was a downgrade compared to ios. why did dev promote android and not desktop linux? u reasoning dont even make sense. UnlikeABoss No, it wasn't a downgrade. destinyhud yes, it was back in android initial release. iOS was better and much more polished at that time. but things changed now. UnlikeABoss "Polished" is not a factor that is used to judge a better OS. There are Linux environments that are much more polished than Windows 10, but that doesn't make desktop Linux better. destinyhud it was both polished and runs better than android at that time. polished was not the only one. it was also polished. android only got better later.. i have used android at that time and it sucked big time. UnlikeABoss You are using today's standards to judge it. If you do that, they both sucked. It worked perfectly fine for the basic things people were using it for at the time. destinyhud they both sucked at that time but android sucked more than iOS at that time. SVem26 I like to think I am in the nerd userbase and I don't care what kernel is used.. can you help me understand why it matters? UnlikeABoss Do you want a brand new obscure kernel in thing that holds most of your sensitive details? TipTop I don't want something that dates back to 90s, is full of zero-days and horrible code contributed by nobodies. UnlikeABoss The idea that it is full of zero days is hilarious. You do realize that the majority of Linux exploits are local, right? Unlike Windows. Yes there is obviously code from the 90s, but very, very little of it. Not to mention that age is not a factor in deciding bad code. The idea that old code is bad code shows your inexperience. By that standard, should we dismiss Chrome because of all the exploits being found in code that was written when it first started? Are we going to create brand new software every few years to purge "old code"? Do you have any idea whatsoever how much Linux has actually changed? Do you have any idea how much of this change is because it's considered a "universal" kernel everyone can use and is focusing on? Do you really think splitting the community over onto another kernel will increase security for either of those kernels? There's a little something called code maturity. There's a reason Microsoft has way less exploits in its kernel today than 10 years ago. They didn't write a new kernel from scratch. Sir_Brizz All OSes are full of vulnerabilities and horrible code written by nobodies. If that is your requirement then you must have gone full luddite by now. ihsan ışık Are you implying that Android got popular because of "nerds" who heard it uses the Linux kernel? UnlikeABoss If you are old enough to know the early days of android you'll know that having every single nerd on the internet promoting Android over iOS most certainly helped get the ball rolling. Once it was pushed, it snowballed into what it is today. m477 Sure. It was the nerds on the internet, not the manufacturers with ads everywhere. Most people still don't know their Galaxy runs Android. UnlikeABoss The giant billboards came YEARS afterwards, cmon. m477 Yes, and that's why Android was so unpopular in the early days. UnlikeABoss What? It was massively popular among all techies for being the open source iOS alternative. m477 You are overestimating the "techies" crowd. Even BlackBerryOS was more popular at the time. Only after the Galaxy S it started to grow, and became popular among normal people. UnlikeABoss Not really. We are talking over a decade ago now, there were far less people on the internet and it was far easier for techies to promote products because everyone was asking their "techie" friend what is best. But these days everyone is an "expert" so that's not as much of a thing. m477 Again, you overestimate how many techies there actually were. Your personal experience is anecdotal. Market shares and sell data are objective. Also, over a decade ago Android was still a camera os, and it wasn't public. UnlikeABoss No, I do not. The further back in time you go, the higher the proportion of techies there were using the internet versus others. People were only just starting to look at buying a smartphone, and asking techies what they should buy. m477 Yes, the concentration on the internet of "techies" on the internet was greater. And? What normal user at the time went to the internet, looked at reviews and said "Oh, look! The HTC magic has Linux! This random guy says its good, so I'm gonna buy it!"? You really think that a bunch of "techies">marketing? A guy saying that his toy-looking HTC G1 is better than the iPhone is more effective than billboards and tv ads? Come on, even Windows Mobile was more popular. It took Samsung's aggressive marketing to make Android popular. UnlikeABoss Windows Mobile and BlackBerry were more popular in the enterprise, that's it. The entire discussion is home users. Also I think there's been some confusion. I wasn't implying that techies on the internet were promoting Android on the internet like a marketing department. I was implying that the internet was very much a "social media" platform for techies to communicate where the majority of them would use Android and mocked the use of iOS. The actual "marketing" happened offline when a normal user would ask their "techie" friend for first time buying advice. It is nothing like that today, and the internet is nothing like the techie community it once was. m477 So, what you're saying is that the internet was a circlejerk of Android users. Ok, and? It didn't affected normal users the slightest, iOS was still more popular until Samsung took Android more seriously. The techie friend thing its only your anecdotal experience, it bears no influence on the market, in the grand scheme of things. I'd even argue that Google's very light marketing did much, much more. Also, the mindless techies that recommended half backed devices instead of better alternatives because "Uh, Linux!!" did more harm than good, both to the users and to Android. UnlikeABoss If you read my OP you'll see my original point was that Google has rode the "Android circlejerk" to popularity, and you can debate how much popularity that added as much as you want. The fact remains, it got the ball rolling. Samsung didn't pick it up "just because", it saw that a lot of people were pushing it. There were several OS at the time it could have used, including sticking to its own. Why bother with Android? Maybe because it wanted to see how much market it could take by appealing to techies? However, if you stand back and look at it, how is this any different from "embrace, extend, extinguish"? Google used that "free marketing" and has now decided to use it's massive popularity to push a different product. (Which has failed in the past and will hopefully fail again). Why hate Microsoft for doing that in the past, but we praise Google for doing it? Why are we excited for something we know nothing about that is creating fragmentation? m477 Samsung had used several OSes, it had Windows Mobile and Phone devices, Symbian devices, and proprietary devices, even Palm OS devices IIRC. They used them all. Android had was the easiest to personalise for them, and create a copy of the best selling product, which was the iPhone, and there was an app market, so they tried to release and market their flagship with it, and market it as broadly as Apple. The first Galaxy (the "non S") was was vastly ignored, because it was as little marketed as all their other devices. The techies crowd was insignificant. The free marketing is just as much as Windows 10 gets for incorporating Ubuntu's bash terminal. What you saw is not really important. I saw lots and lots of Windows Phones in 2010 and 11. Many more than Android devices. Every one I knew had one, and if I had to say which OS was the most popular only based on my personal experience, in my smallish city, I'd obviously would say Windows Phone. Why are you so attached to Linux, excluding all possibilities of giving a possibly better solution a try? The community will just fork the AOSP and continue the development of the Linux branch. UnlikeABoss Cmon, we both know Android was not easier for them to customize than simply using their own OS. No one was recommending it, techie or not, no matter how much they marketed. It's only now they are popular they are trying to slip in their own OS, and still failing. I am not attached to Linux despite people using it as an easy scapegoat to dismiss a discussion critiquing almighty Google. We currently have a situation where most kernel developers focus entirely on Linux, making it virtually the universal kernel. Why are we creating pointless fragmentation there? Why divide that community? Do we honestly believe that a divided community can produce a better kernel, or do we love it because Google is doing it? Would we love it if Microsoft did this? m477 The proprietary OS they used at the time was a Java based thing with a flash interface. Hardly able to compete against iOS. It was easier for them to use the "next Symbian" that they could customise as they wanted, and that also had an app market. If they made, say, Bada, before Android become established and popular, and marketed it as much as they did with their Galaxy S, the market would be very different today. The normal user doesn't care what OS their shiny phone runs, as long as there's facebook. I am a GNU/Linux user since the first half of the 2000s, and I've always critiqued Google for using Linux as a kernel on phones. Linux might be the universal kernel, but smartphones need a more streamlined solution. I don't care if it's Google, the MIT, or Richard Stallman in person to do it. I liked WP8 architecture. Fragmentation is not pointless if it brings benefits to the user. TipTop Nobody cares about your FSF agenda. John Q I think the chief reason Google is not using Linux is that they want a real-time OS (RTOS). Linux is at best a "soft" RTOS, possessing a real-time scheduler but this is still not nearly as real-time as an actual RTOS should be. It would take a very large effort to do that for Linux so it makes sense that Google would want to make their own kernel that they can have full control over. UnlikeABoss Let's ignore the fact that Linux is used in real time car systems for a moment. Could you elaborate on why you think Google would want/need a RTOS on their smartphones? M6 The kernel they're using, 'magenta', is opened source. So who cares if they're using linux or not? Does everyone have to use linux? UnlikeABoss No it doesn't have to be Linux. But who else will use Magenta? Probably no one. So why are we fragmenting the kernel space further? Why would you choose an immature kernel for something as valuable (your data) as your smartphone. Would you trust that? I would much rather developers continue focusing on a single kernel. WesleySmalls But wouldn't Magenta be this single kernel? UnlikeABoss If everyone decided to ditch Linux and focus purely on Magenta as the universal kernel, yes. Will that happen? WesleySmalls Could be, just not overnight. The market was already fairly well developed when Linux arrived in 1991, yet it still managed to become a very, if not the most, important player in the market. It's certainly possible, it will just require proper investment(and neglect of their alternate platforms) and patience to make it work M6 That's some straight up communist shit right there. Let's just work on one thing, because we only need one thing, everything else is redundant! Let's not allow other people to do the same thing in a different way, because competition totally doesn't spur innovation at all. WORPspeed So Andromeda definitely dead or still happening? sleepinlight Pretty sure this IS Andromeda, or at least a part of it. Andromeda was never an official name for anything, it was just the internal project name for some sort of new and/or merged OS. WORPspeed I thought Andromeda specifically referred to merging Android and Chrome OS. So is that specific merger dead or on life-support? John Q Nah, the Android/Chrome merger was just speculation from what Andromeda seemed to be. There was never any concrete evidence to imply that Andromeda was a merger. WORPspeed To quote Androidpolice : "So please, when you see Fuchsia mentioned, or speculation that it "is" Andromeda, know that it is just that: speculation. Last we heard from sources we consider extremely reliable, Android was the basis of Andromeda, and Andromeda would see its commercial debut on a new Pixel laptop later this year. It is possible Google has changed plans around Andromeda, that the initiative itself may have even been scrapped. Though, we have no reason to think so - it's more that we don't know, and haven't heard anything about Andromeda in quite some time." http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/02/15/speculation-around-googles-fuchsia-os-and-andromeda-is-creating-confusion-and-misinformation/ WORPspeed http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/02/15/speculation-around-googles-fuchsia-os-and-andromeda-is-creating-confusion-and-misinformation/ That makes them seem very separate Srujan https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/e7fda716dfcfdca76e200e51a9c9144c72e183c7e76d36b910c20ee0931aee79.gif destinyhud if this replaces android rather than having 2 separate codebase, I am all up for it. splitting the android community is dangerous senor_heisenberg Well if this does end up being what replaces Android or what Android evolves into, I just hope my apps and whatnot are compatible. Ain't got the time or money to be investing into another ecosystem. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman That's a tricky, double-edged sword. I can't fathom they would not support the old apps, or at least the vast majority of them, for exactly that reason. But in doing so it will likely be held back at least slightly from what it can/should be. Backward-compatibility tends to hold everything back. What I'd wager is we won't see this until hardware's powerful enough to make emulating the old system in a VM relatively cheap and easy, with back-end Play Store penalties to developers who don't shift to the new app models, and then slow phase-outs in stages of the older functionality and support until the new OS is running exclusively its own setup. senor_heisenberg That sounds good. Randy Gindy I think Google porting the Android Run-time to Chrome OS was to see if they could do it. morteum This is old news, I'm waiting for Fuchsia 2.0 Barracuda. /s marcusmarcus2 What if they aren't going by Animal names in general but by mammal names. I'd skip the Fuchsia 2.0 Bandicoot. It will probably be "Crash" prone. Alfonso Surroca Three operating systems is not nearly enough. We need at least two more announced at I/O.

Suicide_Note There is no update problem. Nexus/Pixels run the latest and greatest. OEMs who mess with the OS give their customers severely delayed updates. pfmiller Nexus and Pixels run the latest and greatest for two years. Nobody would accept this OS update situation if it was on a desktop OS. MJ Thank God it's phones we are talking about and not a desktop PC. marcusmarcus2 That is exactly why Windows XP lasted only a couple years before all computers updated to Windows 7... Seriously though. I'm fine with only getting Android version upgrades phones for 2 years. But they really need to extend out security updates beyond 3 years. Suicide_Note This isn't a desktop OS, not to mention people tend to change phones much more often than their desktops. pfmiller Sure it's not a desktop OS, but no sense pretending that what we have leaves nothing to be desired. And sure people change their phones more often that their desktops, but there's absolutely no reason to change every 2 years. Doby Gillis Which is a problem, Einstein. Suicide_Note Not if you're a Nexus/Pixel owner, Dilbert. Randy Gindy I would generally say there is. Android phones are not supported for nearly as long as an iPhone. The reason being that the chip set manufacturers do not release new drivers. Shelly-Man Vol 2 It's looks pretty neat for a development stage. Rami Well Android has to reach Z someday. In the case, Hello Fuchsia! marcusmarcus2 Those split-screens will be really useful for running of of Google's different messaging apps. Hopefully OS's aren't the new messaging apps of Google.

Neither, this is just a side project many developers use to test and work out the feasability of a variety of things. Android is a very well developed environment, and replacing it whole is simply a no-go. Things will just gradually evolve, as they have already done with Dalvik being replaced by ART, for example. Sir_Brizz I don't think you're wrong, but it would be in Google's best interest to start building a non-JVM runtime that apps can run inside with a native language that Google has 100% full control over like Go or Dart. Тарас Мукин 1. This is definetelly Chat UI! It came from Telegram bots and whatsoever, and it is so smart of Google to be developing it now.

PVL_93_RU Those "stories" on the "home screen" look like they'd fit perfectly for a kiosk-type display, where you have a lot of space to work with JG Fuchsia is a purple-y pink color. T-Mobile's color is Magenta, a slightly different purple-y pink color T-Mobile is rumored to be looking into launching their own phone... Coincidence??? Almost certainly, without a doubt yes... But consider... T-Mobile also launched the first Android phone... yoloswag Inspired by the messaging team, Google wants to start working on a 2nd operating system. JG Magenta is designed for "modern phones and modern personal computers with fast processors, non-trivial amounts of ram with arbitrary peripherals doing open ended computation." Modern personal computers huh? I've been interested in Google packing ChromeOS into a LiveCD type set up we could test/install on our own computers... (*Yes, I know of Chromium, haven't tried it yet... But I would prefer it coming direct from Google, faster updates and all that). It could be interesting to try out another of Google's OSs without having to fork over several hundred for new hardware... The only problem would be drivers to support the various hardware. If not modified too much, ChromeOS could possibly use the original Gentoo Linux drivers. But with Fuchsia using its own unique kernel... That might throw things off a bit... I know a few less tech-savey individuals who would probably be more comfortable if the same OS powered their phone, tablet and desktop (should Google opt to replace Android with Fuchsia). Especially if it could run both Android apps and Chrome extensions natively. Zxyon Rhysivz This could be the beginning of distros for Android. *Imagines Ubuntu Android* Peter World Citizen This will run in parallel with Android.

By: Trends Desk | New Delhi | Updated: May 9, 2017 9:05 am Today’s Google doodle plays with the concepts of vision clarity as a tribute to Ferdinand Monoyer. Most of us – at some point of our life – have squinted at a bunch of letters of varying sizes at the optician’s or ophthalmologist’s chamber. But not many of us know that the chart was created more than 100 years ago by French ophthalmologist Ferdinand Monoyer and is known as the Monoyer chart. Today, Google is celebrating Monoyer’s 181st birth anniversary with a quirky animated doodle. Monoyer, born on May 9, 1836, also developed the diopter, which is the unit of measurement for vision that is used even today. The diopter measures the distance you’d have to be from text to read it. So, basically, in the chart most of us are familiar with, every row represents a different diopter, from smallest to largest. Ferdinand Monoyer. (Source: Wikimedia Commons) Interestingly, Monoyer changed the font of a particular letter if it didn’t suit him. His logic was that if you’re going to judge a person’s vision by it, that letter had better be as legible as possible. In today’s doodle, the animation plays with the concepts of vision clarity as well as gives a tribute to another of Monoyer’s signatures: his name, hidden in the chart. Have you been able to spot it? The doodle’s reach spreads over France, of course, as well as the Netherlands, the UK, Denmark, Sweden, Estonia, Lithuania, Poland, Hungary, Croatia, Greece, Canada, Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, Mexico, Nicaragua, Venezuela, Colombia, Peru, Chile, Argentina, India, Indonesia, Australia and New Zealand.

At least eight civilians were killed on both sides in fighting that began when a Pakistani census team accompanied by soldiers visited disputed villages along the southern border on Friday. Pakistan inherited its 2,400-kilometer border with its western neighbor when it gained independence from the British Empire in 1947, but Afghanistan has never formally recognized the frontier. And while official Afghan maps reflect the so-called ‘Durand Line’, many nationalists believe the true border of their country ends at the River Indus that runs though Pakistan and gave India its name. A senior Pakistani security source in Islamabad who requested anonymity said: “Officials from the geological survey departments of the two countries will conduct a survey, and they will also make use of Google Maps.” A second official in Quetta confirmed the sides had agreed to a survey. Internet firm Google complies with local laws in certain countries that compel it to show borders in line with national demands — for instance, its Indian site shows the entirety of disputed Kashmir as being controlled by India. In Pakistan, however, the site shows the internationally-recognized de facto border, the Line of Control, marked with a dotted line to denote it is disputed. Attempts by Pakistan to harden the traditionally soft border with Afghanistan through trenching and fencing that began in 2016 have been met with hostility by Kabul. Ethnic Pashtuns living in the region have traditionally paid it little heed, with villages straddling the frontier that have mosques and houses with one door in Pakistan and another in Afghanistan. Pakistani forces on Sunday elevated their rhetoric when they said they had also killed “more than 50 soldiers” in last week’s border clashes — a claim quickly rejected by Kabul, which said it lost two troops. In an unrelated development, a bomb exploded outside a girls’ school in northwestern Pakistan early Monday, wounding two police officers but injuring no students as classes had not yet begun, authorities said. The bomb at the school in a suburb of Peshawar, capital of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, detonated as a counter-terrorism police vehicle drove by, officials said. “Two counter terrorism department personnel were wounded in the IED (improvise explosive device),” Peshawar police chief Mohammad Tahir said. A second device was found nearby but was defused, he said. The blast damaged the main gate of the school and some walls inside, Tahir added. No group has yet claimed the responsibility for the attack, but Taliban militants opposed to girls’ education have bombed hundreds of school in the northwest and tribal areas bordering Afghanistan. Peshawar, which has suffered for years from militancy and unrest, was the site of Pakistan’s deadliest ever attack, a Taliban assault on an army-run school in 2014 that left more than 150 people dead, most of them children. — AFP SHARE Facebook Twitter tweet Previous articleGirl drives minibus to save driver’s life Next articleMonaco eye history-making comeback against Juventus Mohammed Ahmed Al Aidroos RELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR Water ministry staff to be shifted to new ministries King receives a message from Tunisia’s president Saudi leadership congratulates Macron NO COMMENTS LEAVE A REPLY Cancel reply May 2017 S M T W T F S « Apr       1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31   STAY CONNECTED 1,626,844FansLike 43,683FollowersFollow Ads Recent Posts Water ministry staff to be shifted to new ministries May 9, 2017 King receives a message from Tunisia’s president May 9, 2017 Saudi leadership congratulates Macron May 9, 2017 Oil output cuts may be extended beyond 2017: Falih May 9, 2017 Saudi navy discovers mines planted off Yemeni coast May 9, 2017 Archives May 2017 April 2017 March 2017 February 2017 January 2017 December 2016 November 2016 October 2016 September 2016 August 2016 July 2016 June 2016 May 2016 April 2016 March 2016 February 2016 January 2016 December 2015 November 2015 October 2015 September 2015 August 2015 July 2015 © Saudi Gazette 2015 All rights reserved.

Now, we’re getting another peek at the operating system, complete with placeholder graphics. First and foremost, for those not familiar, Fuchsia is Google’s attempt at essentially dumping the Linux kernel and creating its very own in-house solution. Reportedly running on either its LK or Magenta microkernel, depending on the specifications of the device, Fuchsia OS’ interface and apps are coded using Google’s Flutter SDK. Flutter can output cross-platform code, with apps using the SDK being written in Dart, Google’s answer to JavaScript. We also know that for the OS to properly showcase the firm’s Material Design interface, it makes use of the Vulkan-based graphics renderer codenamed Escher. According to HotFix, the UI of Fuchsia is currently known as Armadillo (artist’s rendering above). You can compile your own version of Fuchsia, which HotFix has done. Though still in its early stages, this is how the UI looks like in action: A readme on the project’s Github page reveals that the OS’ vertically-scrolling home screen would include a single white circle as a home button, and a profile picture in the middle of the screen, complete with a date, city, and a battery icon. This would be flanked on the top by individual “Story” cards – roughly equivalent to recent apps – as well as Story clusters, which make use of a “non-Widget class” called Panel to track the “size and position of a Story's window in its StoryCluster's StoryClusterWidget.” These Story cards - apps, in essence - are sorted by “last opened”, meaning the most recent apps would be at the bottom of the list, where they’re easiest to access by the user. The Google Now / Google Assistant integration is also present, as just below the profile picture you’ll find a list of “suggestions”, much like today’s Google Assistant is offering. As described by the company, “Conceptually a suggestion is a representation of an action the user can take to augment an existing story or to start a new one”. It is worth noting that this part of the system UI also has a search bar, which when tapped, brings up a keyboard that’s different from what we have today on Android, and sports a custom, darker, Fuchsia interface. Long-pressing to access symbols or settings does not work at this time, however. Speaking of settings, a quick settings-like UI can be revealed when you tap on the profile picture, giving access to connectivity indicators, sliders for volume and brightness, as well as toggles for airplane mode, do not disturb, and auto-rotate. At the very bottom of this panel that pops up you can see buttons labeled “more” and “log out” which, like the others described in the previous sentence, do not actually do anything at this time. As pointed out by Ars Technica, perhaps the most curious (or potentially interesting) feature in Fuchsia is its ability to take “Story” cards and display them in split screen. You can either do a 50/50 split vertically or horizontally or a 33/33/33 split horizontally, as well as being able to display a 50/50 vertical split next to a full height app. The UI seems to be capable of going even further in terms of multitasking customization, since it allows you to drag in four apps which would be split 25/75 on one side, and 75/25 on the other. You’re even allowed to display tabs for the various opened apps in split screen, and when going back to the Story cluster, you’ll see that the layout of the split screen view is reflected in the image of the Story card. Needless to say, you are currently able to keep adding apps to the split screen view until the whole thing crashes, so it might need some reigning in. In essence, Fuchsia is Google’s attempt at controlling every part of the software experience, no matter how small. It’s probably how the search giant would’ve approached building Android all those years ago if it had the knowledge it has now about maintaining the OS and pushing it out to the over one billion users it currently has. It’s reasonably clear that this might one day replace Android and Chrome OS. Ars Technica points out that Android had been cooking on low heat inside the company for five years before it was unveiled to the public, so maybe we’ll see a more fleshed out Fuchsia in 2020. Then again, it’s also possible that the OS will remain pretty obscure well past the half-decade mark, much like Microsoft’s Midori. Take a look at some of the placeholder UI elements currently present in Fuchsia via the gallery below, and sound off in the comments about Google’s mysterious universal operating system.

Siddharth Pai Simply creating stiffer penalties for those who breach Internet systems and profit from doing so will not be enough. On 5 May, Mint ran an interview with Nandan Nilekani that addressed data leaks and the Aadhaar card. While Nilekani was clear that Aadhaar’s infrastructure doesn’t allow it to store any data, and that it is in fact very secure, he did point to the need for getting a privacy law passed, to allow regulators to deal with the overall issue of cyber-security. He decried the focus on Aadhaar, which by its very design, does not allow for a “man in the middle” type of attack. Nilekani separately pointed out that the proliferation of smartphones has led to Indians giving away their private data to large Internet companies such as Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft, and that companies such as these are, for now at least, immune to Indian laws. The same week has seen at least two other news items: one about Google, and the other about Facebook. Google is now fighting a “phishing” attack to its popular Google Docs service, which allows multiple users to work on the same document when they are trying to collaborate on a work product. The attackers in this phishing scam masqueraded as genuine users of Google Docs, and used this cloak of legitimacy to induce unsuspecting users into granting permissions to other applications. Google has announced that it is now taking steps to thwart this latest phishing attempt by removing the offending accounts and by pushing out security updates to its users. So now the stable door is shut, after the horse has bolted. Also Read: The biggest privacy risk is your smartphone: Nandan Nilekani In the aftermath of a far more macabre tale, Facebook announced that the company will hire 3,000 people to watch for violent videos posted to its site. Facebook’s announcement comes after two grisly videos posted to the website caused horror and dismay over the last few weeks. In one instance, a murder in the US was uploaded, and in the other, a murder-cum-suicide in Thailand. Facebook already pays over 4,000 workers to screen videos flagged as inappropriate by its users, but all this work happens after the damage is done. The extra 3,000 putative hires will also work after the deed is done. Why must we have a situation where the large Internet giants wait for horrendous things to happen before they react? Silicon Valley has so far followed a “go fast and break things” credo, which has led to enormous leaps in technology over the last few years. Technological advances aside, every prediction regarding the amount of data being created, and therefore owned by these giants, is astronomic. And they already have the algorithms to predict suspect behaviour. I have spoken in this column about how the death of net neutrality, which now looms over the US, and soon over the rest of the world, is likely to create oligopolistic behaviour among firms who either generate or transport such data. In a recent interview, when referring to Reliance’s Jio, Mukesh Ambani talked about how data is the new oil. Data is now measured in zettabytes, a fantastically large unit of data, and these data appear to be growing at an exponential pace that simply beggars belief. My read is that what Ambani meant was that these data can be now be used in various ways, by applying technology-driven predictive algorithmic techniques, into schemes for Internet giants and telecom firms to discover and exploit new sources of revenue. And it shall surely follow, that nothing can be private anymore. As Nilekani pointed out in the Mint interview, our smartphones, and the applications that run on them, already know so much about us: from where we are at any given point of time through triangulation or the use of Global Positioning System software to even whether we may be drunk or sober, by using gyroscopes and accelerometers built into each device. In my mind, this puts the onus for data security and protection squarely on the Internet giants. With nearly 2 billion users, and untold advances in data analysis to predict human behaviour such as when two of its users appear to be falling in love with one another, is it likely that Facebook could have foreseen that someone would use its video streaming service to broadcast acts of violence? Was there no attempt to make sure that posting this sort of horror was impossible to do in the first place? Also Read: Are consumers’ interests safe in a digital world? The “go fast and break things” credo has reached its ethical frontier. Does “breaking things” mean allowing horrific murders to be broadcast live? The post facto response has long been sufficient justification when it comes to hackers and the compromising of personal data, but it simply doesn’t work when horror is on the line. The credo might have worked when Amazon, Facebook, Google et al were young start-up companies trying to blaze new trails, but they are now behemoths in their own right, and the common good of almost all the world’s “netizens” lies in their hands. At the rate we are going, it won’t be long before all the world’s citizens are also netizens. This means that in some sense, these firms have moved from being start-ups to custodians of the common good, with the associated ethical considerations that need to put the brakes on the credo of “going fast and breaking things”. This is also a conundrum for law-makers. Simply creating stiffer penalties for those who breach Internet systems and profit from doing so will not be enough. The responsibility to police oneself before gruesome events occur probably now lies with the new oligarchs of the Internet, and they need to have a strong incentive to do so. Maybe it is time to impose stiff fines for each such infraction. That said, there is no simple answer. The nuances are endless, and points of view myriad. One thing is for sure: we are sailing in uncharted waters.

At the time, there wasn't much to get excited about besides the potential - it only had a command-line interface. Now the project has a snazzy new, but clearly unfinished, interface. Summary of Fuchsia First, it's worth going over exactly what Fuchsia is, because it's been quite a while since we talked about it. As opposed to all of Google's other OSes, such as Android and Chrome OS, Fuchsia uses the company's new 'Magenta' kernel instead of Linux. According to the project's documentation, Magenta is designed for "modern phones and modern personal computers with fast processors, non-trivial amounts of ram with arbitrary peripherals doing open ended computation." Magenta's apps and the system interface are written with Google's Flutter SDK, which was initially designed to create cross-platform apps for iOS and Android. Flutter applications are written in Dart, the company's home-grown programming language. All of the system and apps are rendered by 'Escher,' which uses OpenGL or Vulkan to display everything. The 'Armadillo' interface So, on to the new stuff. Fuchsia's system UI has a new name - 'Armadillo.' Ars Technica was able to compile Armadillo into an Android APK, since it is written with the above-mentioned Flutter SDK. The interface doesn't really do anything besides looking pretty, but it does give us an idea of what the finished product could look like. The home screen is a vertical list, with a profile picture, the time, and a battery indicator in the center. Tapping the profile picture brings up something similar to Android's Quick Settings, with toggles for auto-rotate, do not disturb, Airplane Mode, and so on. Above the profile picture is the 'Story,' which the documentation describes as "a set of apps and/or modules that work together for the user to achieve a goal." Currently, this works similarly to Android's Recents screen. Users will also be able to combine stories into a 'Story Cluster.' This is what dragging a Story card into split-screen looks like. Dragging a Story card onto another one triggers a split-screen mode. The user can split an app 50/50 vertically or horizontally, drag in another app for a 33/33/33 split, or even have a tab bar appear for using all the open apps in full-screen. You can even have two apps split vertically next to two other split apps, seen below. This is far more flexible than Android's current multi-tasking functionality, but whether or not it will stay this way is uncertain. Below the profile picture is a panel resembling Google Now, with a placeholder search bar and suggestion cards. Armadillo's documentation says, "a suggestion is a representation of an action the user can take to augment an existing story or to start a new one. [The] suggestion contains enough information to create the visual representation of that concept." So maybe they will work more like an app launcher? It's hard to tell at this point. The Google Now panel, showing Fuchsia's keyboard. Keep in mind that all of this is subject to change, as the Armadillo interface (and the rest of Fuchsia OS) is still under heavy development. It's also hard to tell what Google's plans are for the operating system. Will it be neglected to Internet-of-Things devices and other basic hardware, or will it some day replace Android altogether? We'll have to wait and see.

Suicide_Note Because Google can. Corbin Davenport Ron from Ars Technica put it best: "Fuchsia really seems like a project that asks 'how would we design Android today, if we could start over?' It's a brand-new, Google-developed kernel running a brand-new, Google-developed SDK that uses a brand-new, Google-developed programming language and it's all geared to run Google's Material Design interface as quickly as possible. Google gets to dump Linux and the GPL, it can dump Java and the problems it caused with Oracle, and Google can basically insulate itself from all of Android's upstream projects and bring all the development in-house. Doing such a thing on the scale of Android today would be a massive project." makapav Would it still be open source? Also, what would happen to all the existing APKs? Corbin Davenport Fuchisa is completely open source right now. As for running Android apps, maybe Google will add some kind of stop-gap compatibility layer for running Android apps, like Chrome OS has. destinyhud read the article Suicide_Note Perhaps instead of replacing Android, this will *become* Android, as in Android P or Q? Or be the merger of Android/Chrome? m477 I could see that as Android 10. Definitely too early for P. morteum I wonder if the reason it is called "Armadillo" is because they're starting from A again, but this time they're using animals instead of desserts. Christopher Bement I think it's a smart plan, based on the guess that there's more animals to pick from in the world than tasty desserts. teolinux Ubuntu docet Paul "Tasty treats," not necessarily desserts. That said, armadillos could be a tasty treat. I won't judge. MJ I have heard desserts and candy used before which are wrong but "tasty treats" is a new one for me. To be more accurate, Android names are actually all confectionery foods. A "tasty treat" could be a slice of pizza (aka Android S). LOL Randy Gindy Armadillo is the name of the UI not the OS build itself. Matt74UK Smooth on the inside, crunchy on the outside. Armadillo ! (a few UK people of a certain age may get that). John Doe Idk this is a whole new OS with a new kernel, I doubt this will be done with an OTA update for Android. Mantas Pakėnas Even nowadays, some of Android's new functionality cannot be done via OTA updates (like dual system partitions, forced encryption I believe, etc). To make a completely hard cut sometime when this is ready, and if it's meant to replace Android, is not completely unimaginable. As is updating via OTA. If apple was able to change their file system via OTA, I don't see why changing most of the parts would not be possible. However, nobody aside from Google would do it, almost guaranteed :) Suicide_Note It could likely be done for Pixel devices, and possibly for future devices released after this new version of the OS rolls out. Adrian Meredith quite possibly, after all there no reason it couldn't also run android apps jonathan What they need to do is make this googles very own os for their pixel line and leave android for the oems Suicide_Note Not a chance. To much name recognition with Android for Google to drop it in favor of something else specific to the Pixel lineup. Dallas King Android Z confirmed! Suicide_Note More like Android A for Armadillo. m477 APK plz (no, really, I want a compiled apk the demo) Maxwell “Max” Weinbach https://github.com/fuchsia-mirror/sysui MJ Your link wasn't what the OP asked for... Maxwell “Max” Weinbach the only way to get the APK is to compile it yourself, so I linked to the Github page to a place to download the files to compile. The closest they will get. MJ Than you should have replied there is no known APK or not at all. Maxwell “Max” Weinbach It does not matter that much. I am building the APK right now. Once it is done I will post it. Here is the link on how to compile it. http://www.hotfixit.net/single-post/2017/05/03/How-to-build-Armadillo MJ Don't waste your time... They updated that article with an download of the APK. Maxwell “Max” Weinbach thanks. they just did that. I still compiled it myself though. I will try to get more out of it while I have the Sysui downloaded. Michel R. https://www.androidfilehost.com/?w=files&flid=178684 there you go MJ http://www.hotfixit.net/single-post/2017/05/03/How-to-build-Armadillo Latex beats nudity More of Proprietary code ? No thank you, we already had enough with this Pixel crud. I hope this OS dies quicker or become a chromebook OS. m477 It's open source. Latex beats nudity It's OSS but just like Android It'll be more heavily dependent on the google APIs to make it work. Look at the Pixel SysUI, Just being OSS doesn't make it open source... It's Google's OS not a Linux Based one. If this is going to replace Android It's doomsday on multiple levels. destinyhud billions of people dont care if its running linux kernel or not. maybe very few like u might. do iphone users care why kernel it runs. none of them care. u r just noise tbh Latex beats nudity Billions of people don't code. You are being a kool-aid joke tbh. destinyhud exaclt only few code and even on that few many dont care if it runs linux or not. look at iphone there are more dev there and yet they dont care for kernel. u r delusional in ur own world m477 Android it's already been on a Google-dependent road for years. I don't think this is going to change either way. An Angry Chihuahua https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/magenta/+/master/docs/getting_started.md heres the source code. do some research my dude WitnessG Imagining this running on a Google made processor is exciting. Badouken If this was the OS for the Pixel 2 alongside a Google made processor I think id cry! WitnessG Yeah I don't see this coming out for at least another 2-3 years. Badouken Indeed, but we can dream! ha Suicide_Note Maybe the Pixel 3 or 4 will see the dream become reality. Suicide_Note I'm betting this is what we'll see in a couple years time. As another commenter stated, starting with Armadillo could be Google's way of starting from the beginning (letter A codename), since there's more animal babes to use for each letter than there are dessert names to use. Timothy Vreeland You are getting the furries excited. Nomaan Armadillo should be compared to holo/material and not to dessert names. nachofrand What makes you think Google would be good at making SoCs? They're a software company and don't have the hardware expertise for hardcore ASIC development like that. Granted they can hire people, but in the end, does it matter? They're going to use ARM either way. UnlikeABoss Google fanboyism. The same reason he's excited over a brand new OS. He knows absolutely nothing about it, short of the fact that it will create more fragmentation not only in the OS space, but also the kernel space. So all we know are negative things so far. This is what we call exciting now is it? Why? Just because Google is doing it? If Microsoft made this exact same announcement, would we all be excited? Oh dear. Zsolt V No, because essentially everybody loathes Microsoft. Almost nobody's life would be worse if Microsoft vanished. marcusmarcus2 Don't they design and build their own servers to use for all their websites? Seems like those hardware work well for them. Sergii Pylypenko It's one thing to assemble the server using off-the-shelf components, or even to order a custom motherboard. It's a very different thing to design and manufacture your own chips. marcusmarcus2 I'm not saying it is the same, just that they are not only software experts. Them designing and building the servers show they do have hardware expertise that could assist them in doing the same to chips. Zsolt V Except Google's servers are not assembled from off the shelf components. Haven't been for a few years now. Roy What about TPU? Adrian Vovk Samsung Exynos devices are faster than Snapdragon, iPhones seem underpowered but are extremely snappy, etc. The point is that making both the software and hardware leads to a very fast ecosystem. Also, Google are making the TPU for neural networks nachofrand Yes, as expected. Exynos is faster than Snapdragon on the Galaxy phones, but put an Exynos in another phone...oh wait, you can't. That's the whole entire point. Snapdragon SoCs are general purpose SoCs and can be used for a multitude of phones so they're not custom tuned to every phone individually. Exynos have very specific power rails and the chip is made specifically for that phone. The thing is, sure this is better, but it's marginal and hardly worth talking about. They both use the same ARM architecture so performance gains are pretty negligible. Besides that, this is how Samsung makes money....off of device sales. Google doesn't make money that way. That isn't their business model so at this point it doesn't make sense for them to build their own SoCs when they could just work closer with hardware companies. They make their own TPUs because it aligns with their business model. Adrian Vovk The instruction set doesn't really matter? I can have a 6700k and a 6500k and the 6700k will perform much better even though they are both amd64. With what Google is doing with the Pixels (still as snappy as day one here) I'm pretty sure they can optimize it further than Samsung does. They have made it run smoother in some cases on a chip that they didn't manufacture. If they made their own chip it would allow them many freedoms that they otherwise don't have = easier design of the device. I brought up the TPUs because that is experience in chip manufacturing Jason What makes you say iPhones are under powered ? Apples chips are some of the fastest around and are extremely powerful. Adrian Vovk Specs wise. They have much worse specs on paper and it would lead to a slower experience, except Apple can optimize it because they make both the chip and the OS Stephen Sharp They could use Risc-V and have to pay to license absolutely nothing, while being able to make processors purpose built for their OS Randy Gindy That would be an interesting move. Stephen Sharp Indeed, I really want Risc-V to succeed as an open ISA nachofrand They could. But in my opinion, it's unlikely. Google isn't trying to compete with Samsung and Apple in device sales and that isn't their business model. People using their services so they can show ads is their business model. It doesn't make sense for Google to make their own SoC when others are already doing a good job. Plus, if they went to RISC-V then what? What about the modem? They have to buy a standalone modem from Qualcomm or Intel. Now you have to hire system integration and test engineers to make sure the modem is working with your SoC. Oh and then you need a whole firmware team to control the modem. At that point, buy a full blown SoC with the modem on chip. Stephen Sharp Eh you lost me at "Pixel phone" and all the other hardware they sell. Google also is a Platinum member of the Risc-V foundation, and if there is a direction they are going, more control or less control, I would guess it's "more". But that's just a guess nachofrand Hardware isn't even close to the same thing as asic development. IC design is a different world. Granted they do some custom hardware, but SoCs are a much much larger feat. It's still a possibility they do so, but it doesn't make sense with their current business model imo. Captain On! 1 - Google has stated that they're going to make their own silicon for the Pixels in time. 2 - Google actually owns/operates the world's most powerful quantum computer. They know how to make chips. Randy Gindy That quantum computer was built by DWave though Angel I read (somewhere don’t remember) that they have three different quantum computers systems. One from DWave and two home-produced. From those two, one was made by engineers and not that disimilar from DWave in its operations. The other was made by physicists and uses a different approach. nachofrand 1. I could be wrong, but I've only read that they plan on working closer with chip manufacturers. 2. Google didn't make that computer. Even if they did, quantum is so different those skills don't even translate. Romario Maxwell Google made their own custom ASIC called the Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) for their AI/Machine Learning needs on their cloud platform. See https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2016/05/Google-supercharges-machine-learning-tasks-with-custom-chip.html and https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2017/04/quantifying-the-performance-of-the-TPU-our-first-machine-learning-chip.html nachofrand Sure, although a TPU is just an accelerator. Think of it as the hexagon DSP inside of the Snapdragon SoC. That's like 1/10 of the entire chip. SoC design is much larger. Timothy Vreeland How many examples of hardware design do people have to point out before you stop? Sure the hardware they worked on previously isn't exactly the same... But before they started the hardware they are currently working on, they worked on previous hardware that wasn't the same as what they are doing now. They have shown they are competent in designing many kinds of hardware. Or do you suggest a company can only build one kind of hardware and nothing else for all eternity? How did Samsung make it's current in-house chips? Did they go to ARM college? Have they been making ARM chips since the dawn of time? No. They put together some teams and got to work, so stop blabbing and being negative. sweenish Their AI that finally beat the world's top Go players was running on custom Google chips. It's not like they don't know how. Pixelexel Imagine a Google Pixel with a Google made processor, with Fuschia, with Project Fi with Google WiFi powered by Google fiber. If I'd have this, my life would be complete. Iamsecond Ha, no. A Google processor? Supported for 18 months, then replaced with a new processor that performs half as well (but has stickers.) Does not fully process Android code, because at Google one hand doesn't even know the other hand is there, let alone talk to it. Has 20 cores (only 2 enabled outside US for 'reasons.') Has a dedicated co-processor to enable ads in every app, even those that previously didn't have them. Jason Google can't even get a phone out the door without issues and you want them to make the chips too...lol. I'll pass. UnlikeABoss "In house kernel instead of Linux". Yeah, hopefully this dies in a thousand pits of fire. "Hey Linux guys, you know how you've helped us make billions over the years with a free open source kernel? Well, we were just using you to get the "nerd" userbase. Now we own the market thanks to you guys promoting its use of Linux, we will gradually phase you out." .... m477 I hope not. Linux is not really a kernel made with smartphone in minds. I don't care for being a fan of a kernel over another. UnlikeABoss Yeah. I'd much rather use a brand new untested kernel (and all the teething issues that will come with it) in my smartphone than a mature, stable one that's hacked on by hundreds and thousands of people every month. I mean, it's just a smartphone, we don't need it to be a secure environment, right? Let's just make a nice obscure kernel that no one else will use, and just say "but but it's open source!!! love us because we are Google kk". ... ihsan ışık I'm sorry but it just looks like you are a huge Linux fan and are just against change to me. UnlikeABoss Looks can be deceiving. If you're going to fling around the Linux fanboy term, i'll fling around the Google fanboy term, and that will surely be a nice constructive argument that we will both want to continue. m477 So, in 10 years we should still be using an unoptimised kernel like Linux, because anything newer is, well, newer? UnlikeABoss Yeah, because Linux hasn't changed at all in 10 years... m477 Yes, it changed a lot, and it still has many of the same problems, which are intrinsically bound to its structure. It's not a kernel well suited for mobile devices. UnlikeABoss You think the solution is to throw it out the window and start from scratch? I disagree. I'd much rather continue improving the Linux kernel, simply because of all the eyes it will always have on its code. jonathan Play nice ladies lol m477 With this mentality we wouldn't have Linux at all. Why start anything, while we can continue this other thing which purpose was completely different? A mircokenel is more well suited than a monolitic kernel to a mobile devices, both in terms of performance and security. No matter how much you improve Linux, it will never be a microkernel. UnlikeABoss Smartphones don't need a micro kernel in 2017. You could make that argument 7 years ago. Linux can be compiled with the required drivers just like it always could. m477 I made that argument 7 years ago. They always needed something different from Linux. The fact that specific, even proprietary drivers have to be integrated in the kernel (since Android lacks an abstraction layer) is on of the problems of the interaction Android-Linux. destinyhud why havent the nerds made linux on pc's a bigger market share if they were the one who made android a global leader UnlikeABoss No nerd is promoting Linux on the desktop. All social media used to be full of people promoting Android over iOS, these days there's no need to. destinyhud why havent they promoted desktop?? just wondering why they did for android but not for desktop.. linux on desktop was an underdog for decades. android was not popular because of kernal. android became popular because it was opensource and was the only viable competition to ios. people dont care what kernel it runs. UnlikeABoss No nerd worth their salt would promote an environment that would be a downgrade from Windows. Android was not a downgrade from iOS at any point in time, it had a very equal playing field. There's a difference between promoting a good solid FOSS kernel where possible, and promoting an agenda. m477 Android was not a downgrade from iOS at any point in time By this, I get that you never used Android and iOS side by side in 2009-10. UnlikeABoss You clearly value different things. The hackability alone made it an upgrade through its lifetime. m477 The same can be said for GNU/Linux on desktop. UnlikeABoss No it can't, because hackability =/= app availability. i.e. The hackability on Linux desktop doesn't make it win over it's lack of apps, where that isn't an issue on Android. m477 App availability was horrible in the early days, compared to iOS. Even Symbian had more apps. UnlikeABoss That was fine since the early days didn't consist of using your smartphone for very much, due to under powered hardware. Techies didn't go around saying "use iOS because we can all take selfies and stick filters on it". m477 iOS devices didn't have front cameras until mid 2010. The system was better, faster, smoother, the interface was coesive, there were many more apps, and the jailbreak community, to address the techie audience you like to go on about so much, was very, very good. There were tweaks and modifications that even the wildest Android custom ROM didn't have at the time. Android was objectively a downgrade, as much as Linux was on desktop. UnlikeABoss Calling jailbraik an advantage over a FOSS OS is pretty hilarious. iOS wasn't popular because it was better, it was popular because of the amount of people getting their advice from paid employees in store. "Buy iOS so we get a commission". m477 iPhone was more popular for various reasons: marketing, having 2 years of advantage, and, yes, more marketing. But it was also better than Android, as an OS. What benefit did Android bring, with it being opensource, compared to iOS, even to a "techie"? The dev community was laughable in the early days. Why GNU/Linux on desktop was not promoted by "techies" (which is false) and Android was, even if their shortcomings were identical? destinyhud u live in a dream world. even most dev dont care about kernel. what they care about the dev platform. I am a dev and i dont care for the kernel UnlikeABoss If you're talking from the perspective of an app developer then ofcourse you don't care about the kernel, you care about which platform will make you the most money... destinyhud exactly. no one care what kernel it runs.. all dev care is what platform make money. so who is this nerd who care about kernel if most dont care about the kernel.. yeah very very few.. infact rare like u UnlikeABoss Techie == Technology Enthusiast. You can sit here and tell me that you would use the best dev environment all you want but the truth is if the iOS dev environment was awful you'd still suck it up and use it to make your money. I'm not sure how you can class yourself as an enthusiast at that point. destinyhud ever wonder why no one is up voting u and upvoting many of my comments? because what u say is BS. its that simple. I am up for ditching outdated linux if the new kernal is modern and build for modern devices. most dont care for this very few techies.. i hope this becomes true and linux kernel die.. UnlikeABoss "Ever wonder why Google fanboys upvote pro Google content and not anti-Google content?" No, no I don't wonder that. How dare someone critique a pointless change by Google, causing unnecessary fragmentation. Burn them! destinyhud u must be new here.. look at anti google comments here when they make stupid changes but if they make welcome changes people tend to agree UnlikeABoss No, I've been here a long time and made many anti-Google comments as well as pro-Google. No one in the right mind would cheer on kernel fragmentation other than those that think Google can do no wrong. destinyhud open up ur comments history and let me see if u made pro google comments. i have a feeling u r a troll UnlikeABoss Yeah, this discussion is going no where. You are not the authority here and the idea that you want to browse my history to make sure I fall in line is creepy as hell. Bye. destinyhud lol i see u dont want to open ur comments history. obvious troll m477 outdated linux i hope this becomes true and linux kernel die Woah, wait a second here. Linux is not outdated, and its death would be terrible for everyone. It's just that it's not the most apt kernel for a mobile device. destinyhud maybe not outdated but not the right fit for mobile devices. destinyhud android sucked when compared to ios.. it was a downgrade compared to ios. why did dev promote android and not desktop linux? u reasoning dont even make sense. UnlikeABoss No, it wasn't a downgrade. destinyhud yes, it was back in android initial release. iOS was better and much more polished at that time. but things changed now. UnlikeABoss "Polished" is not a factor that is used to judge a better OS. There are Linux environments that are much more polished than Windows 10, but that doesn't make desktop Linux better. destinyhud it was both polished and runs better than android at that time. polished was not the only one. it was also polished. android only got better later.. i have used android at that time and it sucked big time. UnlikeABoss You are using today's standards to judge it. If you do that, they both sucked. It worked perfectly fine for the basic things people were using it for at the time. destinyhud they both sucked at that time but android sucked more than iOS at that time. SVem26 I like to think I am in the nerd userbase and I don't care what kernel is used.. can you help me understand why it matters? UnlikeABoss Do you want a brand new obscure kernel in thing that holds most of your sensitive details? TipTop I don't want something that dates back to 90s, is full of zero-days and horrible code contributed by nobodies. UnlikeABoss The idea that it is full of zero days is hilarious. You do realize that the majority of Linux exploits are local, right? Unlike Windows. Yes there is obviously code from the 90s, but very, very little of it. Not to mention that age is not a factor in deciding bad code. The idea that old code is bad code shows your inexperience. By that standard, should we dismiss Chrome because of all the exploits being found in code that was written when it first started? Are we going to create brand new software every few years to purge "old code"? Do you have any idea whatsoever how much Linux has actually changed? Do you have any idea how much of this change is because it's considered a "universal" kernel everyone can use and is focusing on? Do you really think splitting the community over onto another kernel will increase security for either of those kernels? There's a little something called code maturity. There's a reason Microsoft has way less exploits in its kernel today than 10 years ago. They didn't write a new kernel from scratch. Sir_Brizz All OSes are full of vulnerabilities and horrible code written by nobodies. If that is your requirement then you must have gone full luddite by now. ihsan ışık Are you implying that Android got popular because of "nerds" who heard it uses the Linux kernel? UnlikeABoss If you are old enough to know the early days of android you'll know that having every single nerd on the internet promoting Android over iOS most certainly helped get the ball rolling. Once it was pushed, it snowballed into what it is today. m477 Sure. It was the nerds on the internet, not the manufacturers with ads everywhere. Most people still don't know their Galaxy runs Android. UnlikeABoss The giant billboards came YEARS afterwards, cmon. m477 Yes, and that's why Android was so unpopular in the early days. UnlikeABoss What? It was massively popular among all techies for being the open source iOS alternative. m477 You are overestimating the "techies" crowd. Even BlackBerryOS was more popular at the time. Only after the Galaxy S it started to grow, and became popular among normal people. UnlikeABoss Not really. We are talking over a decade ago now, there were far less people on the internet and it was far easier for techies to promote products because everyone was asking their "techie" friend what is best. But these days everyone is an "expert" so that's not as much of a thing. m477 Again, you overestimate how many techies there actually were. Your personal experience is anecdotal. Market shares and sell data are objective. Also, over a decade ago Android was still a camera os, and it wasn't public. UnlikeABoss No, I do not. The further back in time you go, the higher the proportion of techies there were using the internet versus others. People were only just starting to look at buying a smartphone, and asking techies what they should buy. m477 Yes, the concentration on the internet of "techies" on the internet was greater. And? What normal user at the time went to the internet, looked at reviews and said "Oh, look! The HTC magic has Linux! This random guy says its good, so I'm gonna buy it!"? You really think that a bunch of "techies">marketing? A guy saying that his toy-looking HTC G1 is better than the iPhone is more effective than billboards and tv ads? Come on, even Windows Mobile was more popular. It took Samsung's aggressive marketing to make Android popular. UnlikeABoss Windows Mobile and BlackBerry were more popular in the enterprise, that's it. The entire discussion is home users. Also I think there's been some confusion. I wasn't implying that techies on the internet were promoting Android on the internet like a marketing department. I was implying that the internet was very much a "social media" platform for techies to communicate where the majority of them would use Android and mocked the use of iOS. The actual "marketing" happened offline when a normal user would ask their "techie" friend for first time buying advice. It is nothing like that today, and the internet is nothing like the techie community it once was. m477 So, what you're saying is that the internet was a circlejerk of Android users. Ok, and? It didn't affected normal users the slightest, iOS was still more popular until Samsung took Android more seriously. The techie friend thing its only your anecdotal experience, it bears no influence on the market, in the grand scheme of things. I'd even argue that Google's very light marketing did much, much more. Also, the mindless techies that recommended half backed devices instead of better alternatives because "Uh, Linux!!" did more harm than good, both to the users and to Android. UnlikeABoss If you read my OP you'll see my original point was that Google has rode the "Android circlejerk" to popularity, and you can debate how much popularity that added as much as you want. The fact remains, it got the ball rolling. Samsung didn't pick it up "just because", it saw that a lot of people were pushing it. There were several OS at the time it could have used, including sticking to its own. Why bother with Android? Maybe because it wanted to see how much market it could take by appealing to techies? However, if you stand back and look at it, how is this any different from "embrace, extend, extinguish"? Google used that "free marketing" and has now decided to use it's massive popularity to push a different product. (Which has failed in the past and will hopefully fail again). Why hate Microsoft for doing that in the past, but we praise Google for doing it? Why are we excited for something we know nothing about that is creating fragmentation? m477 Samsung had used several OSes, it had Windows Mobile and Phone devices, Symbian devices, and proprietary devices, even Palm OS devices IIRC. They used them all. Android had was the easiest to personalise for them, and create a copy of the best selling product, which was the iPhone, and there was an app market, so they tried to release and market their flagship with it, and market it as broadly as Apple. The first Galaxy (the "non S") was was vastly ignored, because it was as little marketed as all their other devices. The techies crowd was insignificant. The free marketing is just as much as Windows 10 gets for incorporating Ubuntu's bash terminal. What you saw is not really important. I saw lots and lots of Windows Phones in 2010 and 11. Many more than Android devices. Every one I knew had one, and if I had to say which OS was the most popular only based on my personal experience, in my smallish city, I'd obviously would say Windows Phone. Why are you so attached to Linux, excluding all possibilities of giving a possibly better solution a try? The community will just fork the AOSP and continue the development of the Linux branch. UnlikeABoss Cmon, we both know Android was not easier for them to customize than simply using their own OS. No one was recommending it, techie or not, no matter how much they marketed. It's only now they are popular they are trying to slip in their own OS, and still failing. I am not attached to Linux despite people using it as an easy scapegoat to dismiss a discussion critiquing almighty Google. We currently have a situation where most kernel developers focus entirely on Linux, making it virtually the universal kernel. Why are we creating pointless fragmentation there? Why divide that community? Do we honestly believe that a divided community can produce a better kernel, or do we love it because Google is doing it? Would we love it if Microsoft did this? m477 The proprietary OS they used at the time was a Java based thing with a flash interface. Hardly able to compete against iOS. It was easier for them to use the "next Symbian" that they could customise as they wanted, and that also had an app market. If they made, say, Bada, before Android become established and popular, and marketed it as much as they did with their Galaxy S, the market would be very different today. The normal user doesn't care what OS their shiny phone runs, as long as there's facebook. I am a GNU/Linux user since the first half of the 2000s, and I've always critiqued Google for using Linux as a kernel on phones. Linux might be the universal kernel, but smartphones need a more streamlined solution. I don't care if it's Google, the MIT, or Richard Stallman in person to do it. I liked WP8 architecture. Fragmentation is not pointless if it brings benefits to the user. TipTop Nobody cares about your FSF agenda. John Q I think the chief reason Google is not using Linux is that they want a real-time OS (RTOS). Linux is at best a "soft" RTOS, possessing a real-time scheduler but this is still not nearly as real-time as an actual RTOS should be. It would take a very large effort to do that for Linux so it makes sense that Google would want to make their own kernel that they can have full control over. UnlikeABoss Let's ignore the fact that Linux is used in real time car systems for a moment. Could you elaborate on why you think Google would want/need a RTOS on their smartphones? M6 The kernel they're using, 'magenta', is opened source. So who cares if they're using linux or not? Does everyone have to use linux? UnlikeABoss No it doesn't have to be Linux. But who else will use Magenta? Probably no one. So why are we fragmenting the kernel space further? Why would you choose an immature kernel for something as valuable (your data) as your smartphone. Would you trust that? I would much rather developers continue focusing on a single kernel. WesleySmalls But wouldn't Magenta be this single kernel? UnlikeABoss If everyone decided to ditch Linux and focus purely on Magenta as the universal kernel, yes. Will that happen? WesleySmalls Could be, just not overnight. The market was already fairly well developed when Linux arrived in 1991, yet it still managed to become a very, if not the most, important player in the market. It's certainly possible, it will just require proper investment(and neglect of their alternate platforms) and patience to make it work M6 That's some straight up communist shit right there. Let's just work on one thing, because we only need one thing, everything else is redundant! Let's not allow other people to do the same thing in a different way, because competition totally doesn't spur innovation at all. WORPspeed So Andromeda definitely dead or still happening? sleepinlight Pretty sure this IS Andromeda, or at least a part of it. Andromeda was never an official name for anything, it was just the internal project name for some sort of new and/or merged OS. WORPspeed I thought Andromeda specifically referred to merging Android and Chrome OS. So is that specific merger dead or on life-support? John Q Nah, the Android/Chrome merger was just speculation from what Andromeda seemed to be. There was never any concrete evidence to imply that Andromeda was a merger. WORPspeed To quote Androidpolice : "So please, when you see Fuchsia mentioned, or speculation that it "is" Andromeda, know that it is just that: speculation. Last we heard from sources we consider extremely reliable, Android was the basis of Andromeda, and Andromeda would see its commercial debut on a new Pixel laptop later this year. It is possible Google has changed plans around Andromeda, that the initiative itself may have even been scrapped. Though, we have no reason to think so - it's more that we don't know, and haven't heard anything about Andromeda in quite some time." http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/02/15/speculation-around-googles-fuchsia-os-and-andromeda-is-creating-confusion-and-misinformation/ WORPspeed http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/02/15/speculation-around-googles-fuchsia-os-and-andromeda-is-creating-confusion-and-misinformation/ That makes them seem very separate Srujan https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/e7fda716dfcfdca76e200e51a9c9144c72e183c7e76d36b910c20ee0931aee79.gif destinyhud if this replaces android rather than having 2 separate codebase, I am all up for it. splitting the android community is dangerous senor_heisenberg Well if this does end up being what replaces Android or what Android evolves into, I just hope my apps and whatnot are compatible. Ain't got the time or money to be investing into another ecosystem. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman That's a tricky, double-edged sword. I can't fathom they would not support the old apps, or at least the vast majority of them, for exactly that reason. But in doing so it will likely be held back at least slightly from what it can/should be. Backward-compatibility tends to hold everything back. What I'd wager is we won't see this until hardware's powerful enough to make emulating the old system in a VM relatively cheap and easy, with back-end Play Store penalties to developers who don't shift to the new app models, and then slow phase-outs in stages of the older functionality and support until the new OS is running exclusively its own setup. senor_heisenberg That sounds good. Randy Gindy I think Google porting the Android Run-time to Chrome OS was to see if they could do it. morteum This is old news, I'm waiting for Fuchsia 2.0 Barracuda. /s marcusmarcus2 What if they aren't going by Animal names in general but by mammal names. I'd skip the Fuchsia 2.0 Bandicoot. It will probably be "Crash" prone. Alfonso Surroca Three operating systems is not nearly enough. We need at least two more announced at I/O.

Suicide_Note There is no update problem. Nexus/Pixels run the latest and greatest. OEMs who mess with the OS give their customers severely delayed updates. pfmiller Nexus and Pixels run the latest and greatest for two years. Nobody would accept this OS update situation if it was on a desktop OS. MJ Thank God it's phones we are talking about and not a desktop PC. marcusmarcus2 That is exactly why Windows XP lasted only a couple years before all computers updated to Windows 7... Seriously though. I'm fine with only getting Android version upgrades phones for 2 years. But they really need to extend out security updates beyond 3 years. Suicide_Note This isn't a desktop OS, not to mention people tend to change phones much more often than their desktops. pfmiller Sure it's not a desktop OS, but no sense pretending that what we have leaves nothing to be desired. And sure people change their phones more often that their desktops, but there's absolutely no reason to change every 2 years. Doby Gillis Which is a problem, Einstein. Suicide_Note Not if you're a Nexus/Pixel owner, Dilbert. Randy Gindy I would generally say there is. Android phones are not supported for nearly as long as an iPhone. The reason being that the chip set manufacturers do not release new drivers. Shelly-Man Vol 2 It's looks pretty neat for a development stage. Rami Well Android has to reach Z someday. In the case, Hello Fuchsia! marcusmarcus2 Those split-screens will be really useful for running of of Google's different messaging apps. Hopefully OS's aren't the new messaging apps of Google.

You can install it just as any other apk WesleySmalls "Will it be neglected to Internet-of-Things devices and other basic hardware, or will it some day replace Android altogether?" Neither, this is just a side project many developers use to test and work out the feasability of a variety of things. Android is a very well developed environment, and replacing it whole is simply a no-go. Things will just gradually evolve, as they have already done with Dalvik being replaced by ART, for example. Sir_Brizz I don't think you're wrong, but it would be in Google's best interest to start building a non-JVM runtime that apps can run inside with a native language that Google has 100% full control over like Go or Dart. Тарас Мукин 1. This is definetelly Chat UI! It came from Telegram bots and whatsoever, and it is so smart of Google to be developing it now. Feels like it's going to be next big UI-change after Apple came up with apps divided into screens. 2. "Magenta is designed for ... non-trivial amounts of ram" This is going to be optimised sooo bad.

Nicolas Bahamondes Fuchsia Police... Alvin My money is on this turning into a really useful and innovative messaging app. Oh, with stickers. Superman Not happening, just like module phone. Lol Cyber Jethro I personally think this is for embedded systems like shopping kiosks or other customer service applications. Zach Mauch "Will it be neglected to Internet-of-Things devices and other basic hardware" Did you mean "relegated", not "neglected"? PVL_93_RU Those "stories" on the "home screen" look like they'd fit perfectly for a kiosk-type display, where you have a lot of space to work with JG Fuchsia is a purple-y pink color. T-Mobile's color is Magenta, a slightly different purple-y pink color T-Mobile is rumored to be looking into launching their own phone... Coincidence??? Almost certainly, without a doubt yes... But consider... T-Mobile also launched the first Android phone... yoloswag Inspired by the messaging team, Google wants to start working on a 2nd operating system. JG Magenta is designed for "modern phones and modern personal computers with fast processors, non-trivial amounts of ram with arbitrary peripherals doing open ended computation." Modern personal computers huh? I've been interested in Google packing ChromeOS into a LiveCD type set up we could test/install on our own computers... (*Yes, I know of Chromium, haven't tried it yet... But I would prefer it coming direct from Google, faster updates and all that). It could be interesting to try out another of Google's OSs without having to fork over several hundred for new hardware... The only problem would be drivers to support the various hardware. If not modified too much, ChromeOS could possibly use the original Gentoo Linux drivers. But with Fuchsia using its own unique kernel... That might throw things off a bit... I know a few less tech-savey individuals who would probably be more comfortable if the same OS powered their phone, tablet and desktop (should Google opt to replace Android with Fuchsia). Especially if it could run both Android apps and Chrome extensions natively. Zxyon Rhysivz This could be the beginning of distros for Android. *Imagines Ubuntu Android* Peter World Citizen This will run in parallel with Android.

[Is This Real?] Google Calendar's web interface should be getting a redesign in Q4 2017 Rita El Khoury Follow View All Posts 2017/05/04 5:33am PDTMay 4, 2017 62 Plus 1 on G+ 95 Share on Facebook 69 Share on Twitter Total Shares226 Google News Videos Folks, it's happening. Alright, it's not happening right now, but it should be happening soon. What every Google Calendar user has wanted for years, what every Google user who dared venture in the dark and murky waters of calendar.google.com has clamored for, what every piece of common sense has predicted: Google Calendar's web interface is getting a revamp. According to this roadmap of G Suite features that has appeared in a presentation from Google's Cloud NEXT 2017 event, Google Calendar has a "redesign of web interface" planned for Q4 2017. If that is what it exactly says it should be, then we will finally have that brand spanking new Calendar UI on the web that we've been dreaming of and that we can only achieve with themes and extensions right now. Below, you will find the entire slide of G Suite's usability features roadmap — check it out to see if there's something else planned that is interesting. I've also linked to the exact moment it shows up in the video of the "G Suite Product Roadmap — 2017 and beyond" presentation. (The video is from the EMEA satellite event with Dennis DeMeyere presenting, but it should be the same presentation as the one in San Francisco.) Nothing in here says "Material Design" or "new and shiny and colorful and clean and modern," so we can't jump to conclusions just yet. But at least we have hope that at some point in Q4 2017, Google Calendar on the web will look less like the lost bastard child of a 2013 one-night stand.

Yes, please! F4LL0U7 More reminder functionality, and let me guess, it won't integrate with Google Now, Keep, Calendar, or Inbox reminders? Maybe they'll introduce a new Gmail Messenger while they're at it... F4LL0U7 (I do realize this is most likely adding the ability to create reminders for certain emails that you don't want to fall off your radar, which I fully support!) catalysto This is exactly what Inbox is designed for. F4LL0U7 Right, but some of us just can't get into the Inbox interface, and would still like reminders on our emails. Cesar Cardoso "Gmail - create reminders. Yes, please!" And PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE integrate with all the 70000 reminders on Google products. Even if it's more like "star on steriods", as F4LL0U7 speculates. The Swami i'd settle for something simple, like an actual usable recurring Tasks setup, instead of having to go out for other apps to integrate that functionality into Google Calendar (reminders are worthless to me for this). Unfortunately, Google puts in what Google wants, not what the customer wants. Geoff Johnson Since they love splitting one service into many, I wouldn't be surprised to see features stripped from Calendar and put into a separate app. Mark Curtis Another chat app. Midas Gordon-Farleigh With a bot that you can talk to to create an event. Leo Herzog Did you watch the video? That's literally a feature of their new Hangouts Chat product. Midas Gordon-Farleigh No, I didn't. Unfortunately, not being a GSuite user, I figured there probably wasn't much worth my time in that. That's a bit silly though. Sigh. Defenestratus I don't use calendar for work - but for my personal life it seems to work pretty well. Not sure what it is that people want out of a redesign. Sean Thomas that's the same for me but I only use the android app which is material already. if you go to the calendar website on desktop it's just kind of outdated compared to the app interface. Defenestratus Yeah I guess I can see that. I don't think the design ever really got in the way of my using the product though. The "Create Event" screen on the other hand... it needs some help. Suicide_Note My thoughts exactly. Dawid Kania Hi Rita! I can confirm that this redesign exists. What's even more interesting since yesterday I have access to it. (I'm a member of "New Google Calendar Web Trusted Tester Program" at my current company). We are a G Suite customer and have received invitations to join the trusted testers program on 26th of April. Nicholas Conrad Oops, just violated the trusted tester tos :/ Dawid Kania Hi Nicholas, Thanks for pointing that out. Not being aware of the tos doesn't mean I should assume there is none. My bad. Dan Well now I want to know what was said... Josh Flowers He said https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/72eaa756ce425ac019d0637e35838dcd5846e8e660c771d22950b13701f6eee4.jpg Nicholas Conrad I don't want a candy-coated calendar. Material design really does nothing for me, reminds me of: https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/68423836fc3bc7576ed6e12686edeaa2f4b35db5c9c05a508d014f98b01e0b32.jpg Marcellus1 Disappointed the roadmap doesn't include more on Docs. It didn't have enough features I need to switch from Word. Leo Herzog The only thing left for me is custom fonts. What else are you missing? Kevfromspace A Show ruler setting would be great Marcellus1 I need a lot more formatting options. Trevor Kinsie I really hope that the redesign changes nothing about the functionality. I love Google Calendars as it is, I know it's not the purdiest thing, but that really doesn't matter to me. Please google just give it a nice coat of paint and be done, if you can add features great! Just don't take anything away. Rita El Khoury I love most of Calendar as it is, but for goodness sake, make it easier to set up notifications when someone adds an event to a shared calendar. Right now, users have to manually (and in a not-so-clear way or place) turn on email notifications for shared calendar changes, and that's it. Emails... In 2017. Miles∙Prower I know folks who love Google Calendar for what it is. Me? I'm old enough to have spent years on Palm, then on Pocket PC and Windows Mobile -- with integrations to Office desktop. When I switched over to Android and Google Apps almost a decade ago, I was surprised at the utter shittiness of the user experience in Google's productivity tools. Since then, Android's versions of these tools has improved immensely, while Google's web-based tools have remained as shitty as day 1. And Calendar is by far the worst of them. Come on, it's 2017, and you still have to navigate to a whole new web page that displays an entry form, just to see the details/notes for an appointment? Alex I'd like to see improved support for the quick entry feature on the web. In the app, it will autocomplete locations after you type "at", assigning the full address to the location field of the event. This doesn't happen on the web, at the moment. I usually end up going in to the app to manually set the location, as it works better. mondeca Congrats on finally doing things that needed doing a long time ago? James Donut Anyone uses here gmail as a journal (past dates) rather than scheduler (future)??? Daniel It's about time!

Indian Hills, CO. bazsi44 A little bit of self ad maybe, but I waited too long for this, so I made a Material Redesign myself. :) You will need Stylish and Tampermonkey/Greasemonkey to use it though. http://balazsorban.com/google-calendar-web-material/ https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/ad239a2458b5009c1fa2637ba8d59dc2142593b759733b221e384075cf2fbd8e.png It may have some flows, as I updated it a long time ago. But It is still nicer than that we have now. aRvInD While design overhaul is needed, Mobile Calendar app while I daily use Only sync events/reminders only for past year! Why Google? We are using smartphone with GBs of storage these days. Giving the user with option to sync how history events need to be synced should be made..! Even now when storage is full to remaining 0%, it shows no space to save a small single SMS! Can't SMS memory reserve an MB space prior? Gonzales You'd think that Google loving the cloud there'd be plenty of room. I'm hoping this design carries over to the mobile app. I use that daily. Carson Saldanha Ink for Google's pretty good Anjo Cerdeña 👆 This, but I'm very biased. Diggle Link please? Carson Saldanha Just search for it in the Chrome Web Store Carson Saldanha It's an extension Ger PG Not really thrilled about this considering how the Contacts interface was "improved" some time ago... Winston Oh goody another way to add reminders is coming. Winston This will give me even more choices when adding a reminder, and cover so many use cases.

It seems to be the end of the world!! I use Ink for Google Services Chrome Extension Butterpillar They better add flairs like in mobile apps, otherwise I won't use it. Rita El Khoury Meta: What would happen if during the revamp, calendar.google.com went down and Google forgot it had scheduled a Calendar revamp on its own calendar? wicketr What if their "revamp" is to replace it like Allo replaced Hangouts missing tons of features for an entire year. Like it requires a new account type, and doesn't integrate with your existing gmail account /friends, and missing ability to create events, and lacks any synchronization to the cloud and your mobile device since all data is stored in a cookie on that specific PC. Rita El Khoury Funny, but if we're being serious, Google might mess with a lot of things, but Calendar isn't one of them. Part of the reason they haven't updated the UI until now, I think. JG But don't worry... At least we'll be able to add stickers and animated emoji to our calendar events... That's far more important than silly things like being able to access it from something other than just a single device. Berni Hargrove So the real story here is why doesn't Google publicly release product roadmaps for their other products. Mathew Michel Please Google, upgrade the design this time. It's been too long. HSidhu Reminders are coming to Gmail, now I know which one to choose from (Inbox or Gmail) :) Tks Rita mike shwilly Q4 2018 - Calendar redesign moves from G-Suite to public Cesar Cardoso "Calendar - discoverability of secondary calendars" About time, Google, about time! Urmil Shroff I cannot even believe. Hamilton Jimenez Vasquez Then please they should add more options for Repeat, like "Every last Friday of the Month" or "Every First Monday of the Month". PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE. Gary Oberbrunner First Monday works fine already. Don't think Last does though. sky417 Still no love for Google Finance? Leo Herzog What, you don't like Flash charts?

Tyler Swindell There's always inbox.google.com. DragoCubed Wait a second. iOS gets a today widget? Why don't they just make the widgets on android better and support their own os more. I know Google is a service company, I know there are different teams but... rap Why do upgrades to Google Products make me nervous. it seems half the time they take away functionality. leganzish I'm surprised nobody has commented on this yet (I'm here 2 days after this was posted): Keep getting drawings in iOS in Q2, and not a word about the feature coming to android the rest of the year. Why does google insist on making their apps functionally better on other OSes than their own? And then taking forever to make feature parity or never doing it at all!

It turns out Fuchsia has come a long way from the command line form it existed in when it was first uncovered last August. Google has since added an early user interface to its new operating system featuring a card-based design, as can be seen in Ars Techinca’s gallery of images and the video below. First discovered by Kyle Bradshaw at Hotfix, the user interface is called Armadillo and is said to serve as “the default system UI for Fuchsia.” Armadillo (along with, presumably, other forthcoming Fuchsia... » View on web 0 shares Share on FacebookShare on TwitterPost on  RedditShare by Email   Recent related news Google's UI for New Fuchsia Operating System RevealedLast year in August, Google was rumored to be working on a new operating system that could one day replace Android.

Google's "Fuchsia" operating system is taking shape with a new design Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/08 10:01am PDTMay 8, 2017 29 Plus 1 on G+ 243 Share on Facebook 78 Share on Twitter Total Shares350 Development Google News We first talked about Fuchsia, a new operating system being developed at Google, back in August (in fact, it was my first post here). At the time, there wasn't much to get excited about besides the potential - it only had a command-line interface. Now the project has a snazzy new, but clearly unfinished, interface. Summary of Fuchsia First, it's worth going over exactly what Fuchsia is, because it's been quite a while since we talked about it. As opposed to all of Google's other OSes, such as Android and Chrome OS, Fuchsia uses the company's new 'Magenta' kernel instead of Linux. According to the project's documentation, Magenta is designed for "modern phones and modern personal computers with fast processors, non-trivial amounts of ram with arbitrary peripherals doing open ended computation." Magenta's apps and the system interface are written with Google's Flutter SDK, which was initially designed to create cross-platform apps for iOS and Android. Flutter applications are written in Dart, the company's home-grown programming language. All of the system and apps are rendered by 'Escher,' which uses OpenGL or Vulkan to display everything. The 'Armadillo' interface So, on to the new stuff. Fuchsia's system UI has a new name - 'Armadillo.' Ars Technica was able to compile Armadillo into an Android APK, since it is written with the above-mentioned Flutter SDK. The interface doesn't really do anything besides looking pretty, but it does give us an idea of what the finished product could look like. The home screen is a vertical list, with a profile picture, the time, and a battery indicator in the center. Tapping the profile picture brings up something similar to Android's Quick Settings, with toggles for auto-rotate, do not disturb, Airplane Mode, and so on. Above the profile picture is the 'Story,' which the documentation describes as "a set of apps and/or modules that work together for the user to achieve a goal." Currently, this works similarly to Android's Recents screen. Users will also be able to combine stories into a 'Story Cluster.' This is what dragging a Story card into split-screen looks like. Dragging a Story card onto another one triggers a split-screen mode. The user can split an app 50/50 vertically or horizontally, drag in another app for a 33/33/33 split, or even have a tab bar appear for using all the open apps in full-screen. You can even have two apps split vertically next to two other split apps, seen below. This is far more flexible than Android's current multi-tasking functionality, but whether or not it will stay this way is uncertain. Below the profile picture is a panel resembling Google Now, with a placeholder search bar and suggestion cards. Armadillo's documentation says, "a suggestion is a representation of an action the user can take to augment an existing story or to start a new one. [The] suggestion contains enough information to create the visual representation of that concept." So maybe they will work more like an app launcher? It's hard to tell at this point. The Google Now panel, showing Fuchsia's keyboard. Keep in mind that all of this is subject to change, as the Armadillo interface (and the rest of Fuchsia OS) is still under heavy development. It's also hard to tell what Google's plans are for the operating system. Will it be neglected to Internet-of-Things devices and other basic hardware, or will it some day replace Android altogether? We'll have to wait and see.

Suicide_Note Because Google can. Corbin Davenport Ron from Ars Technica put it best: "Fuchsia really seems like a project that asks 'how would we design Android today, if we could start over?' It's a brand-new, Google-developed kernel running a brand-new, Google-developed SDK that uses a brand-new, Google-developed programming language and it's all geared to run Google's Material Design interface as quickly as possible. Google gets to dump Linux and the GPL, it can dump Java and the problems it caused with Oracle, and Google can basically insulate itself from all of Android's upstream projects and bring all the development in-house. Doing such a thing on the scale of Android today would be a massive project." makapav Would it still be open source? Also, what would happen to all the existing APKs? Corbin Davenport Fuchisa is completely open source right now. As for running Android apps, maybe Google will add some kind of stop-gap compatibility layer for running Android apps, like Chrome OS has. destinyhud read the article Suicide_Note Perhaps instead of replacing Android, this will *become* Android, as in Android P or Q? Or be the merger of Android/Chrome? m477 I could see that as Android 10. Definitely too early for P. morteum I wonder if the reason it is called "Armadillo" is because they're starting from A again, but this time they're using animals instead of desserts. Christopher Bement I think it's a smart plan, based on the guess that there's more animals to pick from in the world than tasty desserts. teolinux Ubuntu docet Paul "Tasty treats," not necessarily desserts. That said, armadillos could be a tasty treat. I won't judge. MJ I have heard desserts and candy used before which are wrong but "tasty treats" is a new one for me. To be more accurate, Android names are actually all confectionery foods. A "tasty treat" could be a slice of pizza (aka Android S). LOL Randy Gindy Armadillo is the name of the UI not the OS build itself. Matt74UK Smooth on the inside, crunchy on the outside. Armadillo ! (a few UK people of a certain age may get that). John Doe Idk this is a whole new OS with a new kernel, I doubt this will be done with an OTA update for Android. Mantas Pakėnas Even nowadays, some of Android's new functionality cannot be done via OTA updates (like dual system partitions, forced encryption I believe, etc). To make a completely hard cut sometime when this is ready, and if it's meant to replace Android, is not completely unimaginable. As is updating via OTA. If apple was able to change their file system via OTA, I don't see why changing most of the parts would not be possible. However, nobody aside from Google would do it, almost guaranteed :) Suicide_Note It could likely be done for Pixel devices, and possibly for future devices released after this new version of the OS rolls out. Adrian Meredith quite possibly, after all there no reason it couldn't also run android apps jonathan What they need to do is make this googles very own os for their pixel line and leave android for the oems Suicide_Note Not a chance. To much name recognition with Android for Google to drop it in favor of something else specific to the Pixel lineup. Dallas King Android Z confirmed! Suicide_Note More like Android A for Armadillo. m477 APK plz (no, really, I want a compiled apk the demo) Maxwell “Max” Weinbach https://github.com/fuchsia-mirror/sysui MJ Your link wasn't what the OP asked for... Maxwell “Max” Weinbach the only way to get the APK is to compile it yourself, so I linked to the Github page to a place to download the files to compile. The closest they will get. MJ Than you should have replied there is no known APK or not at all. Maxwell “Max” Weinbach It does not matter that much. I am building the APK right now. Once it is done I will post it. Here is the link on how to compile it. http://www.hotfixit.net/single-post/2017/05/03/How-to-build-Armadillo MJ Don't waste your time... They updated that article with an download of the APK. Maxwell “Max” Weinbach thanks. they just did that. I still compiled it myself though. I will try to get more out of it while I have the Sysui downloaded. Michel R. https://www.androidfilehost.com/?w=files&flid=178684 there you go MJ http://www.hotfixit.net/single-post/2017/05/03/How-to-build-Armadillo Latex beats nudity More of Proprietary code ? No thank you, we already had enough with this Pixel crud. I hope this OS dies quicker or become a chromebook OS. m477 It's open source. Latex beats nudity It's OSS but just like Android It'll be more heavily dependent on the google APIs to make it work. Look at the Pixel SysUI, Just being OSS doesn't make it open source... It's Google's OS not a Linux Based one. If this is going to replace Android It's doomsday on multiple levels. destinyhud billions of people dont care if its running linux kernel or not. maybe very few like u might. do iphone users care why kernel it runs. none of them care. u r just noise tbh Latex beats nudity Billions of people don't code. You are being a kool-aid joke tbh. destinyhud exaclt only few code and even on that few many dont care if it runs linux or not. look at iphone there are more dev there and yet they dont care for kernel. u r delusional in ur own world m477 Android it's already been on a Google-dependent road for years. I don't think this is going to change either way. An Angry Chihuahua https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/magenta/+/master/docs/getting_started.md heres the source code. do some research my dude WitnessG Imagining this running on a Google made processor is exciting. Badouken If this was the OS for the Pixel 2 alongside a Google made processor I think id cry! WitnessG Yeah I don't see this coming out for at least another 2-3 years. Badouken Indeed, but we can dream! ha Suicide_Note Maybe the Pixel 3 or 4 will see the dream become reality. Suicide_Note I'm betting this is what we'll see in a couple years time. As another commenter stated, starting with Armadillo could be Google's way of starting from the beginning (letter A codename), since there's more animal babes to use for each letter than there are dessert names to use. Timothy Vreeland You are getting the furries excited. Nomaan Armadillo should be compared to holo/material and not to dessert names. nachofrand What makes you think Google would be good at making SoCs? They're a software company and don't have the hardware expertise for hardcore ASIC development like that. Granted they can hire people, but in the end, does it matter? They're going to use ARM either way. UnlikeABoss Google fanboyism. The same reason he's excited over a brand new OS. He knows absolutely nothing about it, short of the fact that it will create more fragmentation not only in the OS space, but also the kernel space. So all we know are negative things so far. This is what we call exciting now is it? Why? Just because Google is doing it? If Microsoft made this exact same announcement, would we all be excited? Oh dear. Zsolt V No, because essentially everybody loathes Microsoft. Almost nobody's life would be worse if Microsoft vanished. marcusmarcus2 Don't they design and build their own servers to use for all their websites? Seems like those hardware work well for them. Sergii Pylypenko It's one thing to assemble the server using off-the-shelf components, or even to order a custom motherboard. It's a very different thing to design and manufacture your own chips. marcusmarcus2 I'm not saying it is the same, just that they are not only software experts. Them designing and building the servers show they do have hardware expertise that could assist them in doing the same to chips. Zsolt V Except Google's servers are not assembled from off the shelf components. Haven't been for a few years now. Roy What about TPU? Adrian Vovk Samsung Exynos devices are faster than Snapdragon, iPhones seem underpowered but are extremely snappy, etc. The point is that making both the software and hardware leads to a very fast ecosystem. Also, Google are making the TPU for neural networks nachofrand Yes, as expected. Exynos is faster than Snapdragon on the Galaxy phones, but put an Exynos in another phone...oh wait, you can't. That's the whole entire point. Snapdragon SoCs are general purpose SoCs and can be used for a multitude of phones so they're not custom tuned to every phone individually. Exynos have very specific power rails and the chip is made specifically for that phone. The thing is, sure this is better, but it's marginal and hardly worth talking about. They both use the same ARM architecture so performance gains are pretty negligible. Besides that, this is how Samsung makes money....off of device sales. Google doesn't make money that way. That isn't their business model so at this point it doesn't make sense for them to build their own SoCs when they could just work closer with hardware companies. They make their own TPUs because it aligns with their business model. Adrian Vovk The instruction set doesn't really matter? I can have a 6700k and a 6500k and the 6700k will perform much better even though they are both amd64. With what Google is doing with the Pixels (still as snappy as day one here) I'm pretty sure they can optimize it further than Samsung does. They have made it run smoother in some cases on a chip that they didn't manufacture. If they made their own chip it would allow them many freedoms that they otherwise don't have = easier design of the device. I brought up the TPUs because that is experience in chip manufacturing Jason What makes you say iPhones are under powered ? Apples chips are some of the fastest around and are extremely powerful. Adrian Vovk Specs wise. They have much worse specs on paper and it would lead to a slower experience, except Apple can optimize it because they make both the chip and the OS Stephen Sharp They could use Risc-V and have to pay to license absolutely nothing, while being able to make processors purpose built for their OS Randy Gindy That would be an interesting move. Stephen Sharp Indeed, I really want Risc-V to succeed as an open ISA nachofrand They could. But in my opinion, it's unlikely. Google isn't trying to compete with Samsung and Apple in device sales and that isn't their business model. People using their services so they can show ads is their business model. It doesn't make sense for Google to make their own SoC when others are already doing a good job. Plus, if they went to RISC-V then what? What about the modem? They have to buy a standalone modem from Qualcomm or Intel. Now you have to hire system integration and test engineers to make sure the modem is working with your SoC. Oh and then you need a whole firmware team to control the modem. At that point, buy a full blown SoC with the modem on chip. Stephen Sharp Eh you lost me at "Pixel phone" and all the other hardware they sell. Google also is a Platinum member of the Risc-V foundation, and if there is a direction they are going, more control or less control, I would guess it's "more". But that's just a guess nachofrand Hardware isn't even close to the same thing as asic development. IC design is a different world. Granted they do some custom hardware, but SoCs are a much much larger feat. It's still a possibility they do so, but it doesn't make sense with their current business model imo. Captain On! 1 - Google has stated that they're going to make their own silicon for the Pixels in time. 2 - Google actually owns/operates the world's most powerful quantum computer. They know how to make chips. Randy Gindy That quantum computer was built by DWave though Angel I read (somewhere don’t remember) that they have three different quantum computers systems. One from DWave and two home-produced. From those two, one was made by engineers and not that disimilar from DWave in its operations. The other was made by physicists and uses a different approach. nachofrand 1. I could be wrong, but I've only read that they plan on working closer with chip manufacturers. 2. Google didn't make that computer. Even if they did, quantum is so different those skills don't even translate. Romario Maxwell Google made their own custom ASIC called the Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) for their AI/Machine Learning needs on their cloud platform. See https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2016/05/Google-supercharges-machine-learning-tasks-with-custom-chip.html and https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2017/04/quantifying-the-performance-of-the-TPU-our-first-machine-learning-chip.html nachofrand Sure, although a TPU is just an accelerator. Think of it as the hexagon DSP inside of the Snapdragon SoC. That's like 1/10 of the entire chip. SoC design is much larger. Timothy Vreeland How many examples of hardware design do people have to point out before you stop? Sure the hardware they worked on previously isn't exactly the same... But before they started the hardware they are currently working on, they worked on previous hardware that wasn't the same as what they are doing now. They have shown they are competent in designing many kinds of hardware. Or do you suggest a company can only build one kind of hardware and nothing else for all eternity? How did Samsung make it's current in-house chips? Did they go to ARM college? Have they been making ARM chips since the dawn of time? No. They put together some teams and got to work, so stop blabbing and being negative. sweenish Their AI that finally beat the world's top Go players was running on custom Google chips. It's not like they don't know how. Pixelexel Imagine a Google Pixel with a Google made processor, with Fuschia, with Project Fi with Google WiFi powered by Google fiber. If I'd have this, my life would be complete. Iamsecond Ha, no. A Google processor? Supported for 18 months, then replaced with a new processor that performs half as well (but has stickers.) Does not fully process Android code, because at Google one hand doesn't even know the other hand is there, let alone talk to it. Has 20 cores (only 2 enabled outside US for 'reasons.') Has a dedicated co-processor to enable ads in every app, even those that previously didn't have them. Jason Google can't even get a phone out the door without issues and you want them to make the chips too...lol. I'll pass. UnlikeABoss "In house kernel instead of Linux". Yeah, hopefully this dies in a thousand pits of fire. "Hey Linux guys, you know how you've helped us make billions over the years with a free open source kernel? Well, we were just using you to get the "nerd" userbase. Now we own the market thanks to you guys promoting its use of Linux, we will gradually phase you out." .... m477 I hope not. Linux is not really a kernel made with smartphone in minds. I don't care for being a fan of a kernel over another. UnlikeABoss Yeah. I'd much rather use a brand new untested kernel (and all the teething issues that will come with it) in my smartphone than a mature, stable one that's hacked on by hundreds and thousands of people every month. I mean, it's just a smartphone, we don't need it to be a secure environment, right? Let's just make a nice obscure kernel that no one else will use, and just say "but but it's open source!!! love us because we are Google kk". ... ihsan ışık I'm sorry but it just looks like you are a huge Linux fan and are just against change to me. UnlikeABoss Looks can be deceiving. If you're going to fling around the Linux fanboy term, i'll fling around the Google fanboy term, and that will surely be a nice constructive argument that we will both want to continue. m477 So, in 10 years we should still be using an unoptimised kernel like Linux, because anything newer is, well, newer? UnlikeABoss Yeah, because Linux hasn't changed at all in 10 years... m477 Yes, it changed a lot, and it still has many of the same problems, which are intrinsically bound to its structure. It's not a kernel well suited for mobile devices. UnlikeABoss You think the solution is to throw it out the window and start from scratch? I disagree. I'd much rather continue improving the Linux kernel, simply because of all the eyes it will always have on its code. jonathan Play nice ladies lol m477 With this mentality we wouldn't have Linux at all. Why start anything, while we can continue this other thing which purpose was completely different? A mircokenel is more well suited than a monolitic kernel to a mobile devices, both in terms of performance and security. No matter how much you improve Linux, it will never be a microkernel. UnlikeABoss Smartphones don't need a micro kernel in 2017. You could make that argument 7 years ago. Linux can be compiled with the required drivers just like it always could. m477 I made that argument 7 years ago. They always needed something different from Linux. The fact that specific, even proprietary drivers have to be integrated in the kernel (since Android lacks an abstraction layer) is on of the problems of the interaction Android-Linux. destinyhud why havent the nerds made linux on pc's a bigger market share if they were the one who made android a global leader UnlikeABoss No nerd is promoting Linux on the desktop. All social media used to be full of people promoting Android over iOS, these days there's no need to. destinyhud why havent they promoted desktop?? just wondering why they did for android but not for desktop.. linux on desktop was an underdog for decades. android was not popular because of kernal. android became popular because it was opensource and was the only viable competition to ios. people dont care what kernel it runs. UnlikeABoss No nerd worth their salt would promote an environment that would be a downgrade from Windows. Android was not a downgrade from iOS at any point in time, it had a very equal playing field. There's a difference between promoting a good solid FOSS kernel where possible, and promoting an agenda. m477 Android was not a downgrade from iOS at any point in time By this, I get that you never used Android and iOS side by side in 2009-10. UnlikeABoss You clearly value different things. The hackability alone made it an upgrade through its lifetime. m477 The same can be said for GNU/Linux on desktop. UnlikeABoss No it can't, because hackability =/= app availability. i.e. The hackability on Linux desktop doesn't make it win over it's lack of apps, where that isn't an issue on Android. m477 App availability was horrible in the early days, compared to iOS. Even Symbian had more apps. UnlikeABoss That was fine since the early days didn't consist of using your smartphone for very much, due to under powered hardware. Techies didn't go around saying "use iOS because we can all take selfies and stick filters on it". m477 iOS devices didn't have front cameras until mid 2010. The system was better, faster, smoother, the interface was coesive, there were many more apps, and the jailbreak community, to address the techie audience you like to go on about so much, was very, very good. There were tweaks and modifications that even the wildest Android custom ROM didn't have at the time. Android was objectively a downgrade, as much as Linux was on desktop. UnlikeABoss Calling jailbraik an advantage over a FOSS OS is pretty hilarious. iOS wasn't popular because it was better, it was popular because of the amount of people getting their advice from paid employees in store. "Buy iOS so we get a commission". m477 iPhone was more popular for various reasons: marketing, having 2 years of advantage, and, yes, more marketing. But it was also better than Android, as an OS. What benefit did Android bring, with it being opensource, compared to iOS, even to a "techie"? The dev community was laughable in the early days. Why GNU/Linux on desktop was not promoted by "techies" (which is false) and Android was, even if their shortcomings were identical? destinyhud u live in a dream world. even most dev dont care about kernel. what they care about the dev platform. I am a dev and i dont care for the kernel UnlikeABoss If you're talking from the perspective of an app developer then ofcourse you don't care about the kernel, you care about which platform will make you the most money... destinyhud exactly. no one care what kernel it runs.. all dev care is what platform make money. so who is this nerd who care about kernel if most dont care about the kernel.. yeah very very few.. infact rare like u UnlikeABoss Techie == Technology Enthusiast. You can sit here and tell me that you would use the best dev environment all you want but the truth is if the iOS dev environment was awful you'd still suck it up and use it to make your money. I'm not sure how you can class yourself as an enthusiast at that point. destinyhud ever wonder why no one is up voting u and upvoting many of my comments? because what u say is BS. its that simple. I am up for ditching outdated linux if the new kernal is modern and build for modern devices. most dont care for this very few techies.. i hope this becomes true and linux kernel die.. UnlikeABoss "Ever wonder why Google fanboys upvote pro Google content and not anti-Google content?" No, no I don't wonder that. How dare someone critique a pointless change by Google, causing unnecessary fragmentation. Burn them! destinyhud u must be new here.. look at anti google comments here when they make stupid changes but if they make welcome changes people tend to agree UnlikeABoss No, I've been here a long time and made many anti-Google comments as well as pro-Google. No one in the right mind would cheer on kernel fragmentation other than those that think Google can do no wrong. destinyhud open up ur comments history and let me see if u made pro google comments. i have a feeling u r a troll UnlikeABoss Yeah, this discussion is going no where. You are not the authority here and the idea that you want to browse my history to make sure I fall in line is creepy as hell. Bye. destinyhud lol i see u dont want to open ur comments history. obvious troll m477 outdated linux i hope this becomes true and linux kernel die Woah, wait a second here. Linux is not outdated, and its death would be terrible for everyone. It's just that it's not the most apt kernel for a mobile device. destinyhud maybe not outdated but not the right fit for mobile devices. destinyhud android sucked when compared to ios.. it was a downgrade compared to ios. why did dev promote android and not desktop linux? u reasoning dont even make sense. UnlikeABoss No, it wasn't a downgrade. destinyhud yes, it was back in android initial release. iOS was better and much more polished at that time. but things changed now. UnlikeABoss "Polished" is not a factor that is used to judge a better OS. There are Linux environments that are much more polished than Windows 10, but that doesn't make desktop Linux better. destinyhud it was both polished and runs better than android at that time. polished was not the only one. it was also polished. android only got better later.. i have used android at that time and it sucked big time. UnlikeABoss You are using today's standards to judge it. If you do that, they both sucked. It worked perfectly fine for the basic things people were using it for at the time. destinyhud they both sucked at that time but android sucked more than iOS at that time. SVem26 I like to think I am in the nerd userbase and I don't care what kernel is used.. can you help me understand why it matters? UnlikeABoss Do you want a brand new obscure kernel in thing that holds most of your sensitive details? TipTop I don't want something that dates back to 90s, is full of zero-days and horrible code contributed by nobodies. UnlikeABoss The idea that it is full of zero days is hilarious. You do realize that the majority of Linux exploits are local, right? Unlike Windows. Yes there is obviously code from the 90s, but very, very little of it. Not to mention that age is not a factor in deciding bad code. The idea that old code is bad code shows your inexperience. By that standard, should we dismiss Chrome because of all the exploits being found in code that was written when it first started? Are we going to create brand new software every few years to purge "old code"? Do you have any idea whatsoever how much Linux has actually changed? Do you have any idea how much of this change is because it's considered a "universal" kernel everyone can use and is focusing on? Do you really think splitting the community over onto another kernel will increase security for either of those kernels? There's a little something called code maturity. There's a reason Microsoft has way less exploits in its kernel today than 10 years ago. They didn't write a new kernel from scratch. Sir_Brizz All OSes are full of vulnerabilities and horrible code written by nobodies. If that is your requirement then you must have gone full luddite by now. ihsan ışık Are you implying that Android got popular because of "nerds" who heard it uses the Linux kernel? UnlikeABoss If you are old enough to know the early days of android you'll know that having every single nerd on the internet promoting Android over iOS most certainly helped get the ball rolling. Once it was pushed, it snowballed into what it is today. m477 Sure. It was the nerds on the internet, not the manufacturers with ads everywhere. Most people still don't know their Galaxy runs Android. UnlikeABoss The giant billboards came YEARS afterwards, cmon. m477 Yes, and that's why Android was so unpopular in the early days. UnlikeABoss What? It was massively popular among all techies for being the open source iOS alternative. m477 You are overestimating the "techies" crowd. Even BlackBerryOS was more popular at the time. Only after the Galaxy S it started to grow, and became popular among normal people. UnlikeABoss Not really. We are talking over a decade ago now, there were far less people on the internet and it was far easier for techies to promote products because everyone was asking their "techie" friend what is best. But these days everyone is an "expert" so that's not as much of a thing. m477 Again, you overestimate how many techies there actually were. Your personal experience is anecdotal. Market shares and sell data are objective. Also, over a decade ago Android was still a camera os, and it wasn't public. UnlikeABoss No, I do not. The further back in time you go, the higher the proportion of techies there were using the internet versus others. People were only just starting to look at buying a smartphone, and asking techies what they should buy. m477 Yes, the concentration on the internet of "techies" on the internet was greater. And? What normal user at the time went to the internet, looked at reviews and said "Oh, look! The HTC magic has Linux! This random guy says its good, so I'm gonna buy it!"? You really think that a bunch of "techies">marketing? A guy saying that his toy-looking HTC G1 is better than the iPhone is more effective than billboards and tv ads? Come on, even Windows Mobile was more popular. It took Samsung's aggressive marketing to make Android popular. UnlikeABoss Windows Mobile and BlackBerry were more popular in the enterprise, that's it. The entire discussion is home users. Also I think there's been some confusion. I wasn't implying that techies on the internet were promoting Android on the internet like a marketing department. I was implying that the internet was very much a "social media" platform for techies to communicate where the majority of them would use Android and mocked the use of iOS. The actual "marketing" happened offline when a normal user would ask their "techie" friend for first time buying advice. It is nothing like that today, and the internet is nothing like the techie community it once was. m477 So, what you're saying is that the internet was a circlejerk of Android users. Ok, and? It didn't affected normal users the slightest, iOS was still more popular until Samsung took Android more seriously. The techie friend thing its only your anecdotal experience, it bears no influence on the market, in the grand scheme of things. I'd even argue that Google's very light marketing did much, much more. Also, the mindless techies that recommended half backed devices instead of better alternatives because "Uh, Linux!!" did more harm than good, both to the users and to Android. UnlikeABoss If you read my OP you'll see my original point was that Google has rode the "Android circlejerk" to popularity, and you can debate how much popularity that added as much as you want. The fact remains, it got the ball rolling. Samsung didn't pick it up "just because", it saw that a lot of people were pushing it. There were several OS at the time it could have used, including sticking to its own. Why bother with Android? Maybe because it wanted to see how much market it could take by appealing to techies? However, if you stand back and look at it, how is this any different from "embrace, extend, extinguish"? Google used that "free marketing" and has now decided to use it's massive popularity to push a different product. (Which has failed in the past and will hopefully fail again). Why hate Microsoft for doing that in the past, but we praise Google for doing it? Why are we excited for something we know nothing about that is creating fragmentation? m477 Samsung had used several OSes, it had Windows Mobile and Phone devices, Symbian devices, and proprietary devices, even Palm OS devices IIRC. They used them all. Android had was the easiest to personalise for them, and create a copy of the best selling product, which was the iPhone, and there was an app market, so they tried to release and market their flagship with it, and market it as broadly as Apple. The first Galaxy (the "non S") was was vastly ignored, because it was as little marketed as all their other devices. The techies crowd was insignificant. The free marketing is just as much as Windows 10 gets for incorporating Ubuntu's bash terminal. What you saw is not really important. I saw lots and lots of Windows Phones in 2010 and 11. Many more than Android devices. Every one I knew had one, and if I had to say which OS was the most popular only based on my personal experience, in my smallish city, I'd obviously would say Windows Phone. Why are you so attached to Linux, excluding all possibilities of giving a possibly better solution a try? The community will just fork the AOSP and continue the development of the Linux branch. UnlikeABoss Cmon, we both know Android was not easier for them to customize than simply using their own OS. No one was recommending it, techie or not, no matter how much they marketed. It's only now they are popular they are trying to slip in their own OS, and still failing. I am not attached to Linux despite people using it as an easy scapegoat to dismiss a discussion critiquing almighty Google. We currently have a situation where most kernel developers focus entirely on Linux, making it virtually the universal kernel. Why are we creating pointless fragmentation there? Why divide that community? Do we honestly believe that a divided community can produce a better kernel, or do we love it because Google is doing it? Would we love it if Microsoft did this? m477 The proprietary OS they used at the time was a Java based thing with a flash interface. Hardly able to compete against iOS. It was easier for them to use the "next Symbian" that they could customise as they wanted, and that also had an app market. If they made, say, Bada, before Android become established and popular, and marketed it as much as they did with their Galaxy S, the market would be very different today. The normal user doesn't care what OS their shiny phone runs, as long as there's facebook. I am a GNU/Linux user since the first half of the 2000s, and I've always critiqued Google for using Linux as a kernel on phones. Linux might be the universal kernel, but smartphones need a more streamlined solution. I don't care if it's Google, the MIT, or Richard Stallman in person to do it. I liked WP8 architecture. Fragmentation is not pointless if it brings benefits to the user. TipTop Nobody cares about your FSF agenda. John Q I think the chief reason Google is not using Linux is that they want a real-time OS (RTOS). Linux is at best a "soft" RTOS, possessing a real-time scheduler but this is still not nearly as real-time as an actual RTOS should be. It would take a very large effort to do that for Linux so it makes sense that Google would want to make their own kernel that they can have full control over. UnlikeABoss Let's ignore the fact that Linux is used in real time car systems for a moment. Could you elaborate on why you think Google would want/need a RTOS on their smartphones? M6 The kernel they're using, 'magenta', is opened source. So who cares if they're using linux or not? Does everyone have to use linux? UnlikeABoss No it doesn't have to be Linux. But who else will use Magenta? Probably no one. So why are we fragmenting the kernel space further? Why would you choose an immature kernel for something as valuable (your data) as your smartphone. Would you trust that? I would much rather developers continue focusing on a single kernel. WesleySmalls But wouldn't Magenta be this single kernel? UnlikeABoss If everyone decided to ditch Linux and focus purely on Magenta as the universal kernel, yes. Will that happen? WesleySmalls Could be, just not overnight. The market was already fairly well developed when Linux arrived in 1991, yet it still managed to become a very, if not the most, important player in the market. It's certainly possible, it will just require proper investment(and neglect of their alternate platforms) and patience to make it work M6 That's some straight up communist shit right there. Let's just work on one thing, because we only need one thing, everything else is redundant! Let's not allow other people to do the same thing in a different way, because competition totally doesn't spur innovation at all. WORPspeed So Andromeda definitely dead or still happening? sleepinlight Pretty sure this IS Andromeda, or at least a part of it. Andromeda was never an official name for anything, it was just the internal project name for some sort of new and/or merged OS. WORPspeed I thought Andromeda specifically referred to merging Android and Chrome OS. So is that specific merger dead or on life-support? John Q Nah, the Android/Chrome merger was just speculation from what Andromeda seemed to be. There was never any concrete evidence to imply that Andromeda was a merger. WORPspeed To quote Androidpolice : "So please, when you see Fuchsia mentioned, or speculation that it "is" Andromeda, know that it is just that: speculation. Last we heard from sources we consider extremely reliable, Android was the basis of Andromeda, and Andromeda would see its commercial debut on a new Pixel laptop later this year. It is possible Google has changed plans around Andromeda, that the initiative itself may have even been scrapped. Though, we have no reason to think so - it's more that we don't know, and haven't heard anything about Andromeda in quite some time." http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/02/15/speculation-around-googles-fuchsia-os-and-andromeda-is-creating-confusion-and-misinformation/ WORPspeed http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/02/15/speculation-around-googles-fuchsia-os-and-andromeda-is-creating-confusion-and-misinformation/ That makes them seem very separate Srujan https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/e7fda716dfcfdca76e200e51a9c9144c72e183c7e76d36b910c20ee0931aee79.gif destinyhud if this replaces android rather than having 2 separate codebase, I am all up for it. splitting the android community is dangerous senor_heisenberg Well if this does end up being what replaces Android or what Android evolves into, I just hope my apps and whatnot are compatible. Ain't got the time or money to be investing into another ecosystem. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman That's a tricky, double-edged sword. I can't fathom they would not support the old apps, or at least the vast majority of them, for exactly that reason. But in doing so it will likely be held back at least slightly from what it can/should be. Backward-compatibility tends to hold everything back. What I'd wager is we won't see this until hardware's powerful enough to make emulating the old system in a VM relatively cheap and easy, with back-end Play Store penalties to developers who don't shift to the new app models, and then slow phase-outs in stages of the older functionality and support until the new OS is running exclusively its own setup. senor_heisenberg That sounds good. Randy Gindy I think Google porting the Android Run-time to Chrome OS was to see if they could do it. morteum This is old news, I'm waiting for Fuchsia 2.0 Barracuda. /s marcusmarcus2 What if they aren't going by Animal names in general but by mammal names. I'd skip the Fuchsia 2.0 Bandicoot. It will probably be "Crash" prone. Alfonso Surroca Three operating systems is not nearly enough. We need at least two more announced at I/O. Suicide_Note One OS for each Google messaging app. AbbyZFresh If this is not customizable, the Andorid OEMs won't be liking this one bit. Miku is Best Vocaloid Leprosy OS. 4Ui812 All of Google's projects are missing one thing..... can I make a suggestion Google? https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/7c05d652570603779d08c4dbce3535891bbfd9b0bd62ebb1c5a084b03e7d21ea.gif Christopher Bement Honestly, this would cure my fever. 4Ui812 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/7ac8191019b3b90075b387b129808b379bef70d0796d8d2263109849fa1b71bc.gif BetterWithRoot https://media.giphy.com/media/3o6ozscsz4jRX7xuQE/giphy.gif saf1927 Reading the comments of armchair experts here makes me smile. klaus666 But will it solve the update problem? Suicide_Note There is no update problem. Nexus/Pixels run the latest and greatest. OEMs who mess with the OS give their customers severely delayed updates. pfmiller Nexus and Pixels run the latest and greatest for two years. Nobody would accept this OS update situation if it was on a desktop OS. MJ Thank God it's phones we are talking about and not a desktop PC. marcusmarcus2 That is exactly why Windows XP lasted only a couple years before all computers updated to Windows 7... Seriously though. I'm fine with only getting Android version upgrades phones for 2 years. But they really need to extend out security updates beyond 3 years. Suicide_Note This isn't a desktop OS, not to mention people tend to change phones much more often than their desktops. pfmiller Sure it's not a desktop OS, but no sense pretending that what we have leaves nothing to be desired. And sure people change their phones more often that their desktops, but there's absolutely no reason to change every 2 years. Doby Gillis Which is a problem, Einstein. Suicide_Note Not if you're a Nexus/Pixel owner, Dilbert. Randy Gindy I would generally say there is. Android phones are not supported for nearly as long as an iPhone. The reason being that the chip set manufacturers do not release new drivers. Shelly-Man Vol 2 It's looks pretty neat for a development stage. Rami Well Android has to reach Z someday. In the case, Hello Fuchsia! marcusmarcus2 Those split-screens will be really useful for running of of Google's different messaging apps. Hopefully OS's aren't the new messaging apps of Google.

Neither, this is just a side project many developers use to test and work out the feasability of a variety of things. Android is a very well developed environment, and replacing it whole is simply a no-go. Things will just gradually evolve, as they have already done with Dalvik being replaced by ART, for example. Sir_Brizz I don't think you're wrong, but it would be in Google's best interest to start building a non-JVM runtime that apps can run inside with a native language that Google has 100% full control over like Go or Dart.

T-Mobile's color is Magenta, a slightly different purple-y pink color T-Mobile is rumored to be looking into launching their own phone... Coincidence??? Almost certainly, without a doubt yes... But consider... T-Mobile also launched the first Android phone... yoloswag Inspired by the messaging team, Google wants to start working on a 2nd operating system. JG Magenta is designed for "modern phones and modern personal computers with fast processors, non-trivial amounts of ram with arbitrary peripherals doing open ended computation." Modern personal computers huh? I've been interested in Google packing ChromeOS into a LiveCD type set up we could test/install on our own computers... (*Yes, I know of Chromium, haven't tried it yet... But I would prefer it coming direct from Google, faster updates and all that). It could be interesting to try out another of Google's OSs without having to fork over several hundred for new hardware... The only problem would be drivers to support the various hardware. If not modified too much, ChromeOS could possibly use the original Gentoo Linux drivers. But with Fuchsia using its own unique kernel... That might throw things off a bit... I know a few less tech-savey individuals who would probably be more comfortable if the same OS powered their phone, tablet and desktop (should Google opt to replace Android with Fuchsia). Especially if it could run both Android apps and Chrome extensions natively. Zxyon Rhysivz This could be the beginning of distros for Android. *Imagines Ubuntu Android* Peter World Citizen This will run in parallel with Android. Samsung: Android & Tizen Google: Android & Fuchsia More ads platforms for Google. ;) DragoCubed OH MY GOD. HOLY HELL. WHAT. ITS HAPPENING. NEW DESIGN. ARGHHHH. Sorry I can't contain this excitement.

Powered by Microsoft's Cortana virtual assistant, the Invoke works like the Amazon Echo or Google Home. Use your voice to control your music, get simple questions answered, or consult your calendar. It does sport one killer feature: With Skype integration, you'll be able to use the Invoke to call people on their normal telephone numbers, if you have Skype credit. What's really interesting is the timing. This news comes ahead of the Microsoft Build conference in Seattle next week, where the tech titan is expected to focus in large part on new opportunities for developers to build Cortana into their own apps and hardware. Meanwhile, Amazon is reinforcing its position as the leader in the burgeoning market for voice assistants: Earlier this month, Amazon unveiled the Echo Look, a camera for the bedroom powered by the Alexa voice assistant. And leaked images suggest that Amazon is planning to release a new Echo with a screen, sooner rather than later. So the introduction of the Invoke, and the new Cortana skills expected to go with it, opens a new front in the battle between the two Seattle-area tech giants. Both Amazon and Microsoft missed the boat on the smartphone: The Amazon Fire Phone was a famous flop, while Microsoft's Windows phone business has slowly bled out into almost nothingness, costing both companies hundreds of millions of dollars. View photos microsoft windows cortana surface proMore (Microsoft) Now, the rise of the voice assistant presents a new opportunity: A brand-new platform, independent from Google's Android or Apple iOS, where they can try to conquer the market early. And so both companies are betting big on voice as a way forward. And while Amazon has a large advantage, being the first to the market, Microsoft told Business Insider earlier this year that it has two big edges: Access to Microsoft Office data like your Outlook calendar, and the fact that over 400 million PCs and tablets already run Windows 10, which has Cortana built in.   As for the Amazon Echo Look camera, it's really a bet on tech called "computer vision," basically turning cameras into "eyes" for artificial intelligence systems. Microsoft is betting on that, too, with the HoloLens goggles, which overlay digital images in the real world.  So while Google and, reportedly, Apple have their own smart-speaker plays, for Microsoft and Amazon this is really a big bet on leapfrogging the existing players entirely. Expect to hear more about this as Microsoft Build kicks off this week.

The decision just became tougher now that they are both discounted.

(AMZN) Echo Is Dominating the New Smart Speaker Market AMZN Echo will dominate the smart speaker market this year May 8, 2017, 11:04 am EDT  |  By Brad Moon, InvestorPlace Contributor Get AMZN alerts: Submit     View All   Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) created the market for voice-activated speakers when it launched the Amazon Echo in 2015. According to a new report by eMarketer, that smart speaker market is going to boom this year, and despite new competition like Alphabet Inc’s (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) Google Home, Amazon Echo market share will still top 70%. That dominance will pay off for AMZN, not just in device sales, but also in additional revenue from shoppers. Source: eMarketer eMarketer: Amazon Echo Market Share to Remain Tops On May 8, eMarketer published a report on the users of digital assistants, spiking out results for smart speakers. According to eMarketer’s numbers, AMZN currently dominates the voice-activated speaker market, and Amazon Echo market share is expected to be 70.6% of all users for 2017. The closest competition is Google Home. Google’s smart speaker — on sale since last November — is expected to capture 23.8% of users this year. The remainder of the smart speaker market is made up of smaller players such as LG Display Co Ltd. (ARD) (NYSE:LPL) and Lenovo Group Limited (ADR) (OTCMKTS:LNVGY). Considering that many of these third-party smart speakers (including at least some LG offerings) feature Alexa integration, AMZN will still benefit from their adoption, despite losing the actual hardware sale. The voice-activated speaker market is also growing at a rapid pace. eMarketer says usage of the devices will grow by nearly 130% in 2017, pointing out: “Consumers are becoming increasingly comfortable with the technology, which is driving engagement. As prices decrease and functionality increases, consumers are finding more reasons to adopt these devices.” eMarketer’s report forecasts 35.6 million Americans will use a voice-activated speaker at least once a month in 2017, an increase of 128.9% for the year. Amazon Echo Sales Boost Shopper Revenue for AMZN Amazon doesn’t release sales numbers for the Echo, but sales of the smart speaker add to its revenue, if not profit (AMZN is infamous for selling its devices near or below cost to drive adoption). Having an Echo in the home makes it easier than ever for consumers to order products directly from amazon.com, boosting the company’s overall sales revenue.

By Denisse Moreno On 05/08/17 AT 4:03 PM Close In the competition among voice-assistant devices, Amazon’s Echo gadgets are taking the lead. Amazon is set to control 70 percent of the voice-enabled speaker device market this year, a forecast from eMarketer released Monday predicted. Amazon’s Echo devices forecast leaves other voice-assistant devices behind, including Google Home. Google Home is expected to control 23.8 percent of the market while the remaining amount will divided among smaller players, including Lenovo, LG, Harmon Kardon and Mattel. Read: Google Home vs. Amazon Echo: Which Device Has More Answers? Although Amazon is doing well and is expected to remain the dominant player in the voice-assistant sector, its market share will decrease slightly in coming years as Google’s share increases, eMarketer predicted. Amazon Echo Look Companies including Amazon are rapidly releasing voice-assistant devices. Amazon launched the Echo Look late last month. The device is an Alexa powered hands-free camera gadget that acts as a “style assistant.” The $199.99 Echo Look takes full-length photos and short videos and includes LED lighting and a depth-sensing camera. Apart from judging outfits, the device also carries out tasks that previous Echo models do, such as checking the weather, controlling smart home appliances and other requests. Amazon Echo With Built-in Display Amazon is expected to reveal another voice-assistant device this year: an Echo with a built-in display. Last week, pictures of the supposed device were leaked via AFTVnews and on Twitter. The device, which is seen in the pictures in black and white models, will include a display that measures about 7 inches, Blomberg reported last year. The new Amazon Echo is supposed to make it easier for users to access content, such as weather forecasts, calendar events and the news. Apple Siri Speaker While Amazon prepares to release the new Echo device, rumor has it Apple will release its own Siri device. KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo recently said Apple’s rumored Siri speaker could be announced as soon as June at the Worldwide Developers Conference. The analyst also revealed the Siri speaker will cost more than the Amazon Echo and that it will support AirPlay. Read: Siri Speaker: There's An 'Over 50% Chance' Apple Will Announce Device At June's WWDC Usage of Voice-Assistant Speakers Expected to Grow As Apple and Amazon gear up to release new voice-assistant speakers, the report predicts 35.6 million Americans will use a voice-activated assistant device (such as the Amazon Echo and Google Home) this year. Usage of voice-assistant speakers is expected to grow by nearly 130 percent in 2017. “Consumers are becoming increasingly comfortable with the technology, which is driving engagement,” Martín Utreras, vice president of forecasting at eMarketer, said in a statement. “As prices decrease and functionality increases, consumers are finding more reasons to adopt these devices.” As for virtual assistant software in general, such as Apple’s Siri, Amazon’s Alexa, Google Now and Microsoft’s Cortana, eMarketer predicted usage will grow by 23 percent. The forecast said 60.5 million Americans will use virtual assistants at least once a month, with the heaviest users being millennials. “Older millennials are the core users of virtual assistants, mainly due to their demand for functionality over entertainment,” Utreras said.

Zeman   @phonescooper Google recently indicated via its Android Beta Program web site that a beta version of Android O will soon be available. Google released a preview version of Android O for developers earlier this year, though it is not stable enough for everyday use. The forthcoming build will be more stable for public beta testing ahead of Android O's full release. Google is expected to make this first beta build of Android O available as an over-the-air download later this month, coinciding with its I/O developer conference scheduled for May 17-19. The primary consumer-facing function of Android O is a picture-in-picture viewer for Android phones (this feature is already available to Android tablets). Most Android O tweaks favor developers, such as the new background limiter, notification channels, adaptive icons, and more. Google also indicated that the beta program for Android 7 Nougat is now concluded. All devices that are enrolled in the Android 7 Nougat beta program have been updated to the latest version of Android and will receive no more beta builds. more info at Google » more info at ZDNet » Related Google Pushes Second Beta of Android 7.1.2 Google has released a second beta update for Android 7.1.2. Build NPG47I is rolling out to the Google Pixel, Pixel XL, Pixel C, Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, and Nexus Player devices, as long as those devices are enrolled in the public beta program. Google Releases Final Developer Preview of Android 7 Nougat Google today made the fifth and final preview of Android 7 Nougat available to app developers and beta testers. Google says devices that are enrolled in the beta program should be able to update to the newest preview right away. Google Releases 4th Dev Preview of Android N Google today made Android N Developer Preview 4 available to developers and beta testers. Google says devices that are enrolled in the beta program should be able to update to the newest preview right away. Google Opens Up Beta Testing for Search App Google is inviting some Android users to join a new beta program for testing the Google Search app. Google did not call out any specific new features in the first beta release, but warned testers it may be unstable or buggy. Android N Named Nougat Google today revealed the dessert-themed name for Android N, and it is Nougat. Google did not specify the number designation for Android Nougat. more news about:   AD Comments Start a new discussion You must log in to post.

Android is still growing and bringing Google services to more consumers than ever, but what comes after Android? Google isn’t resting on its laurels — last year the first open source bits of a new Google OS called Fuchsia appeared online. Google still hasn’t explained what it’s up to with Fuchsia, but the project has continued to develop to the point that it has a new and fascinating interface. Fuchsia is not based on Linux, as Android is. Using the Linux kernel was a perfectly reasonable decision in the early days of Android, but it has held Android back over the years. Fuchsia is based on a new Google-developed microkernel called Magenta. It was designed from the ground up to support a variety of devices and form factors with modern hardware. When Fuchsia first appeared on GitHub last year, there was very little to go on. Compiling the OS only offered up a command line with no user-facing features, but now it has a real (partially) working interface called “Armadillo.” Google opted to use its own Flutter SDK, which relies upon the Dart language. Apps written in Flutter are intended for high-performance scenarios with 120fps animations. Since Armadillo is based on the Flutter SDK, it’s possible to compile it as an Android APK and install it on a phone. That’s what ArsTechnica did, and it’s pretty weird. Armadillo (which has a logo that was definitely drawn by an engineer and not an artist) takes a completely different approach to the home screen than what we see on Android today. It’s a vertical scrolling list of cards. In the middle is a profile card with location, battery, and other information. You can also tap on the profile image to bring up quick settings like airplane mode and Wi-Fi. Above the profile card are “story” cards, the closest analog of which would be Android’s recent apps screen. Stories can also be sets of apps or modules that “work together for the user to achieve a goal.” Below the profile card is a list of suggestions, which is reminiscent of Google Now. This is literally the current Armadillo logo. The current build of Fuchsia includes some interesting window management features, too. The cards and stories can be dragged around the screen and expanded into various proportions including one quarter, a third, half, or three quarters of the screen. It’s cool to see how this could work, but none of the modules in Armadillo actually work right now. It’s also hugely unstable and bound to crash eventually. Fuchsia is obviously still in the early stages, and it may never show up in a real product. However, Google has been adding to Fuchsia over the last few months. Maybe we’ll hear more about it soon.

These efforts are part of Google's Project Zero initiative through which it informs other companies about the vulnerability present in their software products, allowing them 90 days to fix the issue, before details are publicly disclosed. Back in November 2016, Project Zero revealed a "particularly serious" security flaw in Windows 10 just ten days after detailing it to Microsoft - for which it received lots of backlash. It also disclosed yet another vulnerability in Windows soon after, however, this time after its standard 90-day deadline had passed. Now, a Google security researcher has discovered what he terms a "crazy bad" exploit in Windows which has the capacity to easily spread. Tavis Ormandy, a security researcher at Google, has tweeted the following: I think @natashenka and I just discovered the worst Windows remote code exec in recent memory. This is crazy bad. Report on the way. 🔥🔥🔥 — Tavis Ormandy (@taviso) May 6, 2017 While Ormandy hasn't revealed specific details as of yet - and it is currently unknown which versions of Windows this exploit affects - he has said that the vulnerability works against a default install as well, and can easily spread, regardless if it's on a separate Local Area Network (LAN). With details currently scarce - and an official report not yet filed in Google's Project Zero directory - it is remains to be seen how serious the exploit really is. Seeing that Microsoft's Patch Tuesday is just around the corner as well, the company will be hoping that if the issue is legitimate, it has enough time to fix it before tomorrow.

More Comments Tumblr Pinterest Reddit Digg FarkIt StumbleUpon Amazon.com Inc. will dominate Google in the voice-activated speaker market for the next few years due to the early breakout success of its Echo speaker, according to a forecast from research firm EMarketer Inc. More than 35 million Americans will speak to these internet-connected speakers at least once a month this year, more than double the number in 2016, with tech-savvy millennials leading adoption, the EMarketer said in its first forecast of the burgeoning market. About 71 per cent will use Echo devices, with the Google Home speaker trailing at 24 per cent. Amazon will remain the dominant player for the next couple of years, even as Google narrows the gap, because it got such an early lead, EMarketer analyst Martin Utreras said. “Consumers are becoming increasingly comfortable with the technology, which is driving engagement,” he added. “As prices decrease and functionality increases, consumers are finding more reasons to increase adoption.” Related ‘OK , Google ’: How Burger King revealed the hackability of voice assistants like Google Home, Siri and Alexa Made in Waterloo: Google brings ‘Wifi’ product north of the border and it has deep Canadian roots Indeed, a separate study released Monday shows Amazon’s US$50 Echo Dot, the cheapest version of the speaker, is helping boost adoption. The low-cost Dot, which Amazon introduced last year, is enticing consumers to try the technology. The model represents more than half of the 10.7 million Echo devices sold since they were introduced, according to a report by Consumer Intelligence Research Partners. “The Echo Dot definitely helped drive Echo sales since the release of the second generation model in October 2016,” said Josh Lowitz, co-founder of the research firm. “Amazon priced it aggressively, offered big discounts during the holiday season, and offered promotions for purchasing multiple units to encourage gifting and multi-room home use.” Amazon unveiled the Echo, a cylindrical speaker that lets users stream music, dim lights, and order pizza by voice, in 2014. The devices cost as much as US$200 and have become a surprise hit for a company that had struggled with some of its other consumer hardware efforts. Alphabet Inc.’s Google answered with its US$115 Home device two years later. The gadgets target the house, when people might not have a smartphone handy and where portability isn’t an issue. Voice-based assistants, such as Apple Inc.’s Siri, are commonly accessed via smartphones. Amazon will “double down” on its investments in Echo devices and the underlying Alexa voice-activated system this year, CFO Brian Olsavsky said on a recent earnings call. The company in April announced the latest Echo variation, called the Echo Look, a US$200 hands-free camera designed for dressing rooms that takes photos and video on voice command so users can assess their outfits from every angle. The device also lets users submit photos of two outfits to get a recommendation on the best one. The company will soon unveil a new Echo that features a display.

Google's "Fuchsia" operating system is taking shape with a new design Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/08 10:01am PDTMay 8, 2017 29 Plus 1 on G+ 243 Share on Facebook 78 Share on Twitter Total Shares350 Development Google News We first talked about Fuchsia, a new operating system being developed at Google, back in August (in fact, it was my first post here). At the time, there wasn't much to get excited about besides the potential - it only had a command-line interface. Now the project has a snazzy new, but clearly unfinished, interface. Summary of Fuchsia First, it's worth going over exactly what Fuchsia is, because it's been quite a while since we talked about it. As opposed to all of Google's other OSes, such as Android and Chrome OS, Fuchsia uses the company's new 'Magenta' kernel instead of Linux. According to the project's documentation, Magenta is designed for "modern phones and modern personal computers with fast processors, non-trivial amounts of ram with arbitrary peripherals doing open ended computation." Magenta's apps and the system interface are written with Google's Flutter SDK, which was initially designed to create cross-platform apps for iOS and Android. Flutter applications are written in Dart, the company's home-grown programming language. All of the system and apps are rendered by 'Escher,' which uses OpenGL or Vulkan to display everything. The 'Armadillo' interface So, on to the new stuff. Fuchsia's system UI has a new name - 'Armadillo.' Ars Technica was able to compile Armadillo into an Android APK, since it is written with the above-mentioned Flutter SDK. The interface doesn't really do anything besides looking pretty, but it does give us an idea of what the finished product could look like. The home screen is a vertical list, with a profile picture, the time, and a battery indicator in the center. Tapping the profile picture brings up something similar to Android's Quick Settings, with toggles for auto-rotate, do not disturb, Airplane Mode, and so on. Above the profile picture is the 'Story,' which the documentation describes as "a set of apps and/or modules that work together for the user to achieve a goal." Currently, this works similarly to Android's Recents screen. Users will also be able to combine stories into a 'Story Cluster.' This is what dragging a Story card into split-screen looks like. Dragging a Story card onto another one triggers a split-screen mode. The user can split an app 50/50 vertically or horizontally, drag in another app for a 33/33/33 split, or even have a tab bar appear for using all the open apps in full-screen. You can even have two apps split vertically next to two other split apps, seen below. This is far more flexible than Android's current multi-tasking functionality, but whether or not it will stay this way is uncertain. Below the profile picture is a panel resembling Google Now, with a placeholder search bar and suggestion cards. Armadillo's documentation says, "a suggestion is a representation of an action the user can take to augment an existing story or to start a new one. [The] suggestion contains enough information to create the visual representation of that concept." So maybe they will work more like an app launcher? It's hard to tell at this point. The Google Now panel, showing Fuchsia's keyboard. Keep in mind that all of this is subject to change, as the Armadillo interface (and the rest of Fuchsia OS) is still under heavy development. It's also hard to tell what Google's plans are for the operating system. Will it be neglected to Internet-of-Things devices and other basic hardware, or will it some day replace Android altogether? We'll have to wait and see.

It's a brand-new, Google-developed kernel running a brand-new, Google-developed SDK that uses a brand-new, Google-developed programming language and it's all geared to run Google's Material Design interface as quickly as possible. Google gets to dump Linux and the GPL, it can dump Java and the problems it caused with Oracle, and Google can basically insulate itself from all of Android's upstream projects and bring all the development in-house. Doing such a thing on the scale of Android today would be a massive project." makapav Would it still be open source? Also, what would happen to all the existing APKs? Corbin Davenport Fuchisa is completely open source right now. As for running Android apps, maybe Google will add some kind of stop-gap compatibility layer for running Android apps, like Chrome OS has. destinyhud read the article Suicide_Note Perhaps instead of replacing Android, this will *become* Android, as in Android P or Q? Or be the merger of Android/Chrome? m477 I could see that as Android 10. Definitely too early for P. morteum I wonder if the reason it is called "Armadillo" is because they're starting from A again, but this time they're using animals instead of desserts. Christopher Bement I think it's a smart plan, based on the guess that there's more animals to pick from in the world than tasty desserts. teolinux Ubuntu docet Paul "Tasty treats," not necessarily desserts. That said, armadillos could be a tasty treat. I won't judge. MJ I have heard desserts and candy used before which are wrong but "tasty treats" is a new one for me. To be more accurate, Android names are actually all confectionery foods. A "tasty treat" could be a slice of pizza (aka Android S). LOL Randy Gindy Armadillo is the name of the UI not the OS build itself. Matt74UK Smooth on the inside, crunchy on the outside. Armadillo ! (a few UK people of a certain age may get that). John Doe Idk this is a whole new OS with a new kernel, I doubt this will be done with an OTA update for Android. Mantas Pakėnas Even nowadays, some of Android's new functionality cannot be done via OTA updates (like dual system partitions, forced encryption I believe, etc). To make a completely hard cut sometime when this is ready, and if it's meant to replace Android, is not completely unimaginable. As is updating via OTA. If apple was able to change their file system via OTA, I don't see why changing most of the parts would not be possible. However, nobody aside from Google would do it, almost guaranteed :) Suicide_Note It could likely be done for Pixel devices, and possibly for future devices released after this new version of the OS rolls out. Adrian Meredith quite possibly, after all there no reason it couldn't also run android apps jonathan What they need to do is make this googles very own os for their pixel line and leave android for the oems Suicide_Note Not a chance. To much name recognition with Android for Google to drop it in favor of something else specific to the Pixel lineup. Dallas King Android Z confirmed! Suicide_Note More like Android A for Armadillo. m477 APK plz (no, really, I want a compiled apk the demo) Maxwell “Max” Weinbach https://github.com/fuchsia-mirror/sysui MJ Your link wasn't what the OP asked for... Maxwell “Max” Weinbach the only way to get the APK is to compile it yourself, so I linked to the Github page to a place to download the files to compile. The closest they will get. MJ Than you should have replied there is no known APK or not at all. Maxwell “Max” Weinbach It does not matter that much. I am building the APK right now. Once it is done I will post it. Here is the link on how to compile it. http://www.hotfixit.net/single-post/2017/05/03/How-to-build-Armadillo MJ Don't waste your time... They updated that article with an download of the APK.

No thank you, we already had enough with this Pixel crud. I hope this OS dies quicker or become a chromebook OS. m477 It's open source. Latex beats nudity It's OSS but just like Android It'll be more heavily dependent on the google APIs to make it work. Look at the Pixel SysUI, Just being OSS doesn't make it open source... It's Google's OS not a Linux Based one. If this is going to replace Android It's doomsday on multiple levels. destinyhud billions of people dont care if its running linux kernel or not. maybe very few like u might. do iphone users care why kernel it runs. none of them care. u r just noise tbh Latex beats nudity Billions of people don't code. You are being a kool-aid joke tbh. destinyhud exaclt only few code and even on that few many dont care if it runs linux or not. look at iphone there are more dev there and yet they dont care for kernel. u r delusional in ur own world m477 Android it's already been on a Google-dependent road for years. I don't think this is going to change either way. An Angry Chihuahua https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/magenta/+/master/docs/getting_started.md heres the source code. do some research my dude WitnessG Imagining this running on a Google made processor is exciting. Badouken If this was the OS for the Pixel 2 alongside a Google made processor I think id cry! WitnessG Yeah I don't see this coming out for at least another 2-3 years. Badouken Indeed, but we can dream! ha Suicide_Note Maybe the Pixel 3 or 4 will see the dream become reality. Suicide_Note I'm betting this is what we'll see in a couple years time. As another commenter stated, starting with Armadillo could be Google's way of starting from the beginning (letter A codename), since there's more animal babes to use for each letter than there are dessert names to use. Timothy Vreeland You are getting the furries excited. Nomaan Armadillo should be compared to holo/material and not to dessert names. nachofrand What makes you think Google would be good at making SoCs? They're a software company and don't have the hardware expertise for hardcore ASIC development like that. Granted they can hire people, but in the end, does it matter? They're going to use ARM either way. UnlikeABoss Google fanboyism. The same reason he's excited over a brand new OS. He knows absolutely nothing about it, short of the fact that it will create more fragmentation not only in the OS space, but also the kernel space. So all we know are negative things so far. This is what we call exciting now is it? Why? Just because Google is doing it? If Microsoft made this exact same announcement, would we all be excited? Oh dear. Zsolt V No, because essentially everybody loathes Microsoft. Almost nobody's life would be worse if Microsoft vanished. marcusmarcus2 Don't they design and build their own servers to use for all their websites? Seems like those hardware work well for them. Sergii Pylypenko It's one thing to assemble the server using off-the-shelf components, or even to order a custom motherboard. It's a very different thing to design and manufacture your own chips. marcusmarcus2 I'm not saying it is the same, just that they are not only software experts. Them designing and building the servers show they do have hardware expertise that could assist them in doing the same to chips. Zsolt V Except Google's servers are not assembled from off the shelf components. Haven't been for a few years now. Roy What about TPU? Adrian Vovk Samsung Exynos devices are faster than Snapdragon, iPhones seem underpowered but are extremely snappy, etc. The point is that making both the software and hardware leads to a very fast ecosystem. Also, Google are making the TPU for neural networks nachofrand Yes, as expected. Exynos is faster than Snapdragon on the Galaxy phones, but put an Exynos in another phone...oh wait, you can't. That's the whole entire point. Snapdragon SoCs are general purpose SoCs and can be used for a multitude of phones so they're not custom tuned to every phone individually. Exynos have very specific power rails and the chip is made specifically for that phone. The thing is, sure this is better, but it's marginal and hardly worth talking about. They both use the same ARM architecture so performance gains are pretty negligible. Besides that, this is how Samsung makes money....off of device sales. Google doesn't make money that way. That isn't their business model so at this point it doesn't make sense for them to build their own SoCs when they could just work closer with hardware companies. They make their own TPUs because it aligns with their business model. Adrian Vovk The instruction set doesn't really matter? I can have a 6700k and a 6500k and the 6700k will perform much better even though they are both amd64. With what Google is doing with the Pixels (still as snappy as day one here) I'm pretty sure they can optimize it further than Samsung does. They have made it run smoother in some cases on a chip that they didn't manufacture. If they made their own chip it would allow them many freedoms that they otherwise don't have = easier design of the device. I brought up the TPUs because that is experience in chip manufacturing Jason What makes you say iPhones are under powered ? Apples chips are some of the fastest around and are extremely powerful. Adrian Vovk Specs wise. They have much worse specs on paper and it would lead to a slower experience, except Apple can optimize it because they make both the chip and the OS Stephen Sharp They could use Risc-V and have to pay to license absolutely nothing, while being able to make processors purpose built for their OS Randy Gindy That would be an interesting move. Stephen Sharp Indeed, I really want Risc-V to succeed as an open ISA nachofrand They could. But in my opinion, it's unlikely. Google isn't trying to compete with Samsung and Apple in device sales and that isn't their business model. People using their services so they can show ads is their business model. It doesn't make sense for Google to make their own SoC when others are already doing a good job. Plus, if they went to RISC-V then what? What about the modem? They have to buy a standalone modem from Qualcomm or Intel. Now you have to hire system integration and test engineers to make sure the modem is working with your SoC. Oh and then you need a whole firmware team to control the modem. At that point, buy a full blown SoC with the modem on chip. Stephen Sharp Eh you lost me at "Pixel phone" and all the other hardware they sell. Google also is a Platinum member of the Risc-V foundation, and if there is a direction they are going, more control or less control, I would guess it's "more". But that's just a guess nachofrand Hardware isn't even close to the same thing as asic development. IC design is a different world. Granted they do some custom hardware, but SoCs are a much much larger feat. It's still a possibility they do so, but it doesn't make sense with their current business model imo. Captain On! 1 - Google has stated that they're going to make their own silicon for the Pixels in time. 2 - Google actually owns/operates the world's most powerful quantum computer. They know how to make chips. Randy Gindy That quantum computer was built by DWave though Angel I read (somewhere don’t remember) that they have three different quantum computers systems. One from DWave and two home-produced. From those two, one was made by engineers and not that disimilar from DWave in its operations. The other was made by physicists and uses a different approach. nachofrand 1. I could be wrong, but I've only read that they plan on working closer with chip manufacturers. 2. Google didn't make that computer. Even if they did, quantum is so different those skills don't even translate. Romario Maxwell Google made their own custom ASIC called the Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) for their AI/Machine Learning needs on their cloud platform. See https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2016/05/Google-supercharges-machine-learning-tasks-with-custom-chip.html and https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2017/04/quantifying-the-performance-of-the-TPU-our-first-machine-learning-chip.html nachofrand Sure, although a TPU is just an accelerator. Think of it as the hexagon DSP inside of the Snapdragon SoC. That's like 1/10 of the entire chip. SoC design is much larger. Timothy Vreeland How many examples of hardware design do people have to point out before you stop? Sure the hardware they worked on previously isn't exactly the same... But before they started the hardware they are currently working on, they worked on previous hardware that wasn't the same as what they are doing now. They have shown they are competent in designing many kinds of hardware. Or do you suggest a company can only build one kind of hardware and nothing else for all eternity? How did Samsung make it's current in-house chips? Did they go to ARM college? Have they been making ARM chips since the dawn of time? No. They put together some teams and got to work, so stop blabbing and being negative. sweenish Their AI that finally beat the world's top Go players was running on custom Google chips. It's not like they don't know how. Pixelexel Imagine a Google Pixel with a Google made processor, with Fuschia, with Project Fi with Google WiFi powered by Google fiber. If I'd have this, my life would be complete. Iamsecond Ha, no. A Google processor? Supported for 18 months, then replaced with a new processor that performs half as well (but has stickers.) Does not fully process Android code, because at Google one hand doesn't even know the other hand is there, let alone talk to it. Has 20 cores (only 2 enabled outside US for 'reasons.') Has a dedicated co-processor to enable ads in every app, even those that previously didn't have them. Jason Google can't even get a phone out the door without issues and you want them to make the chips too...lol. I'll pass. UnlikeABoss "In house kernel instead of Linux". Yeah, hopefully this dies in a thousand pits of fire. "Hey Linux guys, you know how you've helped us make billions over the years with a free open source kernel? Well, we were just using you to get the "nerd" userbase. Now we own the market thanks to you guys promoting its use of Linux, we will gradually phase you out." .... m477 I hope not. Linux is not really a kernel made with smartphone in minds. I don't care for being a fan of a kernel over another. UnlikeABoss Yeah. I'd much rather use a brand new untested kernel (and all the teething issues that will come with it) in my smartphone than a mature, stable one that's hacked on by hundreds and thousands of people every month. I mean, it's just a smartphone, we don't need it to be a secure environment, right? Let's just make a nice obscure kernel that no one else will use, and just say "but but it's open source!!! love us because we are Google kk". ... ihsan ışık I'm sorry but it just looks like you are a huge Linux fan and are just against change to me. UnlikeABoss Looks can be deceiving. If you're going to fling around the Linux fanboy term, i'll fling around the Google fanboy term, and that will surely be a nice constructive argument that we will both want to continue. m477 So, in 10 years we should still be using an unoptimised kernel like Linux, because anything newer is, well, newer? UnlikeABoss Yeah, because Linux hasn't changed at all in 10 years... m477 Yes, it changed a lot, and it still has many of the same problems, which are intrinsically bound to its structure. It's not a kernel well suited for mobile devices. UnlikeABoss You think the solution is to throw it out the window and start from scratch? I disagree. I'd much rather continue improving the Linux kernel, simply because of all the eyes it will always have on its code. jonathan Play nice ladies lol m477 With this mentality we wouldn't have Linux at all. Why start anything, while we can continue this other thing which purpose was completely different? A mircokenel is more well suited than a monolitic kernel to a mobile devices, both in terms of performance and security. No matter how much you improve Linux, it will never be a microkernel. UnlikeABoss Smartphones don't need a micro kernel in 2017. You could make that argument 7 years ago. Linux can be compiled with the required drivers just like it always could. m477 I made that argument 7 years ago. They always needed something different from Linux. The fact that specific, even proprietary drivers have to be integrated in the kernel (since Android lacks an abstraction layer) is on of the problems of the interaction Android-Linux. destinyhud why havent the nerds made linux on pc's a bigger market share if they were the one who made android a global leader UnlikeABoss No nerd is promoting Linux on the desktop. All social media used to be full of people promoting Android over iOS, these days there's no need to. destinyhud why havent they promoted desktop?? just wondering why they did for android but not for desktop.. linux on desktop was an underdog for decades. android was not popular because of kernal. android became popular because it was opensource and was the only viable competition to ios. people dont care what kernel it runs. UnlikeABoss No nerd worth their salt would promote an environment that would be a downgrade from Windows. Android was not a downgrade from iOS at any point in time, it had a very equal playing field. There's a difference between promoting a good solid FOSS kernel where possible, and promoting an agenda. m477 Android was not a downgrade from iOS at any point in time By this, I get that you never used Android and iOS side by side in 2009-10. UnlikeABoss You clearly value different things. The hackability alone made it an upgrade through its lifetime. m477 The same can be said for GNU/Linux on desktop. UnlikeABoss No it can't, because hackability =/= app availability. i.e. The hackability on Linux desktop doesn't make it win over it's lack of apps, where that isn't an issue on Android. m477 App availability was horrible in the early days, compared to iOS. Even Symbian had more apps. UnlikeABoss That was fine since the early days didn't consist of using your smartphone for very much, due to under powered hardware. Techies didn't go around saying "use iOS because we can all take selfies and stick filters on it". m477 iOS devices didn't have front cameras until mid 2010. The system was better, faster, smoother, the interface was coesive, there were many more apps, and the jailbreak community, to address the techie audience you like to go on about so much, was very, very good. There were tweaks and modifications that even the wildest Android custom ROM didn't have at the time. Android was objectively a downgrade, as much as Linux was on desktop. UnlikeABoss Calling jailbraik an advantage over a FOSS OS is pretty hilarious. iOS wasn't popular because it was better, it was popular because of the amount of people getting their advice from paid employees in store. "Buy iOS so we get a commission". m477 iPhone was more popular for various reasons: marketing, having 2 years of advantage, and, yes, more marketing. But it was also better than Android, as an OS. What benefit did Android bring, with it being opensource, compared to iOS, even to a "techie"? The dev community was laughable in the early days. Why GNU/Linux on desktop was not promoted by "techies" (which is false) and Android was, even if their shortcomings were identical? destinyhud u live in a dream world. even most dev dont care about kernel. what they care about the dev platform. I am a dev and i dont care for the kernel UnlikeABoss If you're talking from the perspective of an app developer then ofcourse you don't care about the kernel, you care about which platform will make you the most money... destinyhud exactly. no one care what kernel it runs.. all dev care is what platform make money. so who is this nerd who care about kernel if most dont care about the kernel.. yeah very very few.. infact rare like u UnlikeABoss Techie == Technology Enthusiast. You can sit here and tell me that you would use the best dev environment all you want but the truth is if the iOS dev environment was awful you'd still suck it up and use it to make your money. I'm not sure how you can class yourself as an enthusiast at that point. destinyhud ever wonder why no one is up voting u and upvoting many of my comments? because what u say is BS. its that simple. I am up for ditching outdated linux if the new kernal is modern and build for modern devices. most dont care for this very few techies.. i hope this becomes true and linux kernel die.. UnlikeABoss "Ever wonder why Google fanboys upvote pro Google content and not anti-Google content?" No, no I don't wonder that. How dare someone critique a pointless change by Google, causing unnecessary fragmentation. Burn them! destinyhud u must be new here.. look at anti google comments here when they make stupid changes but if they make welcome changes people tend to agree UnlikeABoss No, I've been here a long time and made many anti-Google comments as well as pro-Google. No one in the right mind would cheer on kernel fragmentation other than those that think Google can do no wrong. destinyhud open up ur comments history and let me see if u made pro google comments. i have a feeling u r a troll UnlikeABoss Yeah, this discussion is going no where. You are not the authority here and the idea that you want to browse my history to make sure I fall in line is creepy as hell. Bye. destinyhud lol i see u dont want to open ur comments history. obvious troll m477 outdated linux i hope this becomes true and linux kernel die Woah, wait a second here. Linux is not outdated, and its death would be terrible for everyone. It's just that it's not the most apt kernel for a mobile device. destinyhud maybe not outdated but not the right fit for mobile devices. destinyhud android sucked when compared to ios.. it was a downgrade compared to ios. why did dev promote android and not desktop linux? u reasoning dont even make sense. UnlikeABoss No, it wasn't a downgrade. destinyhud yes, it was back in android initial release. iOS was better and much more polished at that time. but things changed now. UnlikeABoss "Polished" is not a factor that is used to judge a better OS. There are Linux environments that are much more polished than Windows 10, but that doesn't make desktop Linux better. destinyhud it was both polished and runs better than android at that time. polished was not the only one. it was also polished. android only got better later.. i have used android at that time and it sucked big time. UnlikeABoss You are using today's standards to judge it. If you do that, they both sucked. It worked perfectly fine for the basic things people were using it for at the time. destinyhud they both sucked at that time but android sucked more than iOS at that time. SVem26 I like to think I am in the nerd userbase and I don't care what kernel is used.. can you help me understand why it matters? UnlikeABoss Do you want a brand new obscure kernel in thing that holds most of your sensitive details? TipTop I don't want something that dates back to 90s, is full of zero-days and horrible code contributed by nobodies. UnlikeABoss The idea that it is full of zero days is hilarious. You do realize that the majority of Linux exploits are local, right? Unlike Windows. Yes there is obviously code from the 90s, but very, very little of it. Not to mention that age is not a factor in deciding bad code. The idea that old code is bad code shows your inexperience. By that standard, should we dismiss Chrome because of all the exploits being found in code that was written when it first started? Are we going to create brand new software every few years to purge "old code"? Do you have any idea whatsoever how much Linux has actually changed? Do you have any idea how much of this change is because it's considered a "universal" kernel everyone can use and is focusing on? Do you really think splitting the community over onto another kernel will increase security for either of those kernels? There's a little something called code maturity. There's a reason Microsoft has way less exploits in its kernel today than 10 years ago. They didn't write a new kernel from scratch. Sir_Brizz All OSes are full of vulnerabilities and horrible code written by nobodies. If that is your requirement then you must have gone full luddite by now. ihsan ışık Are you implying that Android got popular because of "nerds" who heard it uses the Linux kernel? UnlikeABoss If you are old enough to know the early days of android you'll know that having every single nerd on the internet promoting Android over iOS most certainly helped get the ball rolling. Once it was pushed, it snowballed into what it is today. m477 Sure. It was the nerds on the internet, not the manufacturers with ads everywhere. Most people still don't know their Galaxy runs Android. UnlikeABoss The giant billboards came YEARS afterwards, cmon. m477 Yes, and that's why Android was so unpopular in the early days. UnlikeABoss What? It was massively popular among all techies for being the open source iOS alternative. m477 You are overestimating the "techies" crowd. Even BlackBerryOS was more popular at the time. Only after the Galaxy S it started to grow, and became popular among normal people. UnlikeABoss Not really. We are talking over a decade ago now, there were far less people on the internet and it was far easier for techies to promote products because everyone was asking their "techie" friend what is best. But these days everyone is an "expert" so that's not as much of a thing. m477 Again, you overestimate how many techies there actually were. Your personal experience is anecdotal. Market shares and sell data are objective. Also, over a decade ago Android was still a camera os, and it wasn't public. UnlikeABoss No, I do not. The further back in time you go, the higher the proportion of techies there were using the internet versus others. People were only just starting to look at buying a smartphone, and asking techies what they should buy. m477 Yes, the concentration on the internet of "techies" on the internet was greater. And? What normal user at the time went to the internet, looked at reviews and said "Oh, look! The HTC magic has Linux! This random guy says its good, so I'm gonna buy it!"? You really think that a bunch of "techies">marketing? A guy saying that his toy-looking HTC G1 is better than the iPhone is more effective than billboards and tv ads? Come on, even Windows Mobile was more popular. It took Samsung's aggressive marketing to make Android popular. UnlikeABoss Windows Mobile and BlackBerry were more popular in the enterprise, that's it. The entire discussion is home users. Also I think there's been some confusion. I wasn't implying that techies on the internet were promoting Android on the internet like a marketing department. I was implying that the internet was very much a "social media" platform for techies to communicate where the majority of them would use Android and mocked the use of iOS. The actual "marketing" happened offline when a normal user would ask their "techie" friend for first time buying advice. It is nothing like that today, and the internet is nothing like the techie community it once was. m477 So, what you're saying is that the internet was a circlejerk of Android users. Ok, and? It didn't affected normal users the slightest, iOS was still more popular until Samsung took Android more seriously. The techie friend thing its only your anecdotal experience, it bears no influence on the market, in the grand scheme of things. I'd even argue that Google's very light marketing did much, much more. Also, the mindless techies that recommended half backed devices instead of better alternatives because "Uh, Linux!!" did more harm than good, both to the users and to Android. UnlikeABoss If you read my OP you'll see my original point was that Google has rode the "Android circlejerk" to popularity, and you can debate how much popularity that added as much as you want. The fact remains, it got the ball rolling. Samsung didn't pick it up "just because", it saw that a lot of people were pushing it. There were several OS at the time it could have used, including sticking to its own. Why bother with Android? Maybe because it wanted to see how much market it could take by appealing to techies? However, if you stand back and look at it, how is this any different from "embrace, extend, extinguish"? Google used that "free marketing" and has now decided to use it's massive popularity to push a different product. (Which has failed in the past and will hopefully fail again). Why hate Microsoft for doing that in the past, but we praise Google for doing it? Why are we excited for something we know nothing about that is creating fragmentation? m477 Samsung had used several OSes, it had Windows Mobile and Phone devices, Symbian devices, and proprietary devices, even Palm OS devices IIRC. They used them all. Android had was the easiest to personalise for them, and create a copy of the best selling product, which was the iPhone, and there was an app market, so they tried to release and market their flagship with it, and market it as broadly as Apple. The first Galaxy (the "non S") was was vastly ignored, because it was as little marketed as all their other devices. The techies crowd was insignificant. The free marketing is just as much as Windows 10 gets for incorporating Ubuntu's bash terminal. What you saw is not really important. I saw lots and lots of Windows Phones in 2010 and 11. Many more than Android devices. Every one I knew had one, and if I had to say which OS was the most popular only based on my personal experience, in my smallish city, I'd obviously would say Windows Phone. Why are you so attached to Linux, excluding all possibilities of giving a possibly better solution a try? The community will just fork the AOSP and continue the development of the Linux branch. UnlikeABoss Cmon, we both know Android was not easier for them to customize than simply using their own OS. No one was recommending it, techie or not, no matter how much they marketed. It's only now they are popular they are trying to slip in their own OS, and still failing. I am not attached to Linux despite people using it as an easy scapegoat to dismiss a discussion critiquing almighty Google. We currently have a situation where most kernel developers focus entirely on Linux, making it virtually the universal kernel. Why are we creating pointless fragmentation there? Why divide that community? Do we honestly believe that a divided community can produce a better kernel, or do we love it because Google is doing it? Would we love it if Microsoft did this? m477 The proprietary OS they used at the time was a Java based thing with a flash interface. Hardly able to compete against iOS. It was easier for them to use the "next Symbian" that they could customise as they wanted, and that also had an app market. If they made, say, Bada, before Android become established and popular, and marketed it as much as they did with their Galaxy S, the market would be very different today. The normal user doesn't care what OS their shiny phone runs, as long as there's facebook. I am a GNU/Linux user since the first half of the 2000s, and I've always critiqued Google for using Linux as a kernel on phones. Linux might be the universal kernel, but smartphones need a more streamlined solution. I don't care if it's Google, the MIT, or Richard Stallman in person to do it. I liked WP8 architecture. Fragmentation is not pointless if it brings benefits to the user. TipTop Nobody cares about your FSF agenda. John Q I think the chief reason Google is not using Linux is that they want a real-time OS (RTOS). Linux is at best a "soft" RTOS, possessing a real-time scheduler but this is still not nearly as real-time as an actual RTOS should be. It would take a very large effort to do that for Linux so it makes sense that Google would want to make their own kernel that they can have full control over. UnlikeABoss Let's ignore the fact that Linux is used in real time car systems for a moment. Could you elaborate on why you think Google would want/need a RTOS on their smartphones? M6 The kernel they're using, 'magenta', is opened source. So who cares if they're using linux or not? Does everyone have to use linux? UnlikeABoss No it doesn't have to be Linux. But who else will use Magenta? Probably no one. So why are we fragmenting the kernel space further? Why would you choose an immature kernel for something as valuable (your data) as your smartphone. Would you trust that? I would much rather developers continue focusing on a single kernel. WesleySmalls But wouldn't Magenta be this single kernel? UnlikeABoss If everyone decided to ditch Linux and focus purely on Magenta as the universal kernel, yes. Will that happen? WesleySmalls Could be, just not overnight. The market was already fairly well developed when Linux arrived in 1991, yet it still managed to become a very, if not the most, important player in the market. It's certainly possible, it will just require proper investment(and neglect of their alternate platforms) and patience to make it work M6 That's some straight up communist shit right there. Let's just work on one thing, because we only need one thing, everything else is redundant! Let's not allow other people to do the same thing in a different way, because competition totally doesn't spur innovation at all. WORPspeed So Andromeda definitely dead or still happening? sleepinlight Pretty sure this IS Andromeda, or at least a part of it. Andromeda was never an official name for anything, it was just the internal project name for some sort of new and/or merged OS. WORPspeed I thought Andromeda specifically referred to merging Android and Chrome OS. So is that specific merger dead or on life-support? John Q Nah, the Android/Chrome merger was just speculation from what Andromeda seemed to be. There was never any concrete evidence to imply that Andromeda was a merger. WORPspeed To quote Androidpolice : "So please, when you see Fuchsia mentioned, or speculation that it "is" Andromeda, know that it is just that: speculation. Last we heard from sources we consider extremely reliable, Android was the basis of Andromeda, and Andromeda would see its commercial debut on a new Pixel laptop later this year. It is possible Google has changed plans around Andromeda, that the initiative itself may have even been scrapped. Though, we have no reason to think so - it's more that we don't know, and haven't heard anything about Andromeda in quite some time." http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/02/15/speculation-around-googles-fuchsia-os-and-andromeda-is-creating-confusion-and-misinformation/ WORPspeed http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/02/15/speculation-around-googles-fuchsia-os-and-andromeda-is-creating-confusion-and-misinformation/ That makes them seem very separate Srujan https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/e7fda716dfcfdca76e200e51a9c9144c72e183c7e76d36b910c20ee0931aee79.gif destinyhud if this replaces android rather than having 2 separate codebase, I am all up for it. splitting the android community is dangerous senor_heisenberg Well if this does end up being what replaces Android or what Android evolves into, I just hope my apps and whatnot are compatible. Ain't got the time or money to be investing into another ecosystem. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman That's a tricky, double-edged sword. I can't fathom they would not support the old apps, or at least the vast majority of them, for exactly that reason. But in doing so it will likely be held back at least slightly from what it can/should be. Backward-compatibility tends to hold everything back. What I'd wager is we won't see this until hardware's powerful enough to make emulating the old system in a VM relatively cheap and easy, with back-end Play Store penalties to developers who don't shift to the new app models, and then slow phase-outs in stages of the older functionality and support until the new OS is running exclusively its own setup. senor_heisenberg That sounds good. Randy Gindy I think Google porting the Android Run-time to Chrome OS was to see if they could do it. morteum This is old news, I'm waiting for Fuchsia 2.0 Barracuda. /s marcusmarcus2 What if they aren't going by Animal names in general but by mammal names. I'd skip the Fuchsia 2.0 Bandicoot. It will probably be "Crash" prone. Alfonso Surroca Three operating systems is not nearly enough. We need at least two more announced at I/O.

Suicide_Note There is no update problem. Nexus/Pixels run the latest and greatest. OEMs who mess with the OS give their customers severely delayed updates. pfmiller Nexus and Pixels run the latest and greatest for two years. Nobody would accept this OS update situation if it was on a desktop OS. MJ Thank God it's phones we are talking about and not a desktop PC. marcusmarcus2 That is exactly why Windows XP lasted only a couple years before all computers updated to Windows 7... Seriously though. I'm fine with only getting Android version upgrades phones for 2 years. But they really need to extend out security updates beyond 3 years. Suicide_Note This isn't a desktop OS, not to mention people tend to change phones much more often than their desktops. pfmiller Sure it's not a desktop OS, but no sense pretending that what we have leaves nothing to be desired. And sure people change their phones more often that their desktops, but there's absolutely no reason to change every 2 years. Doby Gillis Which is a problem, Einstein. Suicide_Note Not if you're a Nexus/Pixel owner, Dilbert. Randy Gindy I would generally say there is. Android phones are not supported for nearly as long as an iPhone. The reason being that the chip set manufacturers do not release new drivers. Shelly-Man Vol 2 It's looks pretty neat for a development stage. Rami Well Android has to reach Z someday. In the case, Hello Fuchsia! marcusmarcus2 Those split-screens will be really useful for running of of Google's different messaging apps. Hopefully OS's aren't the new messaging apps of Google.

You can install it just as any other apk WesleySmalls "Will it be neglected to Internet-of-Things devices and other basic hardware, or will it some day replace Android altogether?" Neither, this is just a side project many developers use to test and work out the feasability of a variety of things. Android is a very well developed environment, and replacing it whole is simply a no-go. Things will just gradually evolve, as they have already done with Dalvik being replaced by ART, for example. Sir_Brizz I don't think you're wrong, but it would be in Google's best interest to start building a non-JVM runtime that apps can run inside with a native language that Google has 100% full control over like Go or Dart. Тарас Мукин 1. This is definetelly Chat UI! It came from Telegram bots and whatsoever, and it is so smart of Google to be developing it now. Feels like it's going to be next big UI-change after Apple came up with apps divided into screens. 2. "Magenta is designed for ... non-trivial amounts of ram" This is going to be optimised sooo bad.

Nicolas Bahamondes Fuchsia Police... Alvin My money is on this turning into a really useful and innovative messaging app. Oh, with stickers. Superman Not happening, just like module phone. Lol Cyber Jethro I personally think this is for embedded systems like shopping kiosks or other customer service applications. Zach Mauch "Will it be neglected to Internet-of-Things devices and other basic hardware" Did you mean "relegated", not "neglected"? PVL_93_RU Those "stories" on the "home screen" look like they'd fit perfectly for a kiosk-type display, where you have a lot of space to work with JG Fuchsia is a purple-y pink color. T-Mobile's color is Magenta, a slightly different purple-y pink color T-Mobile is rumored to be looking into launching their own phone... Coincidence??? Almost certainly, without a doubt yes... But consider... T-Mobile also launched the first Android phone... yoloswag Inspired by the messaging team, Google wants to start working on a 2nd operating system. JG Magenta is designed for "modern phones and modern personal computers with fast processors, non-trivial amounts of ram with arbitrary peripherals doing open ended computation." Modern personal computers huh? I've been interested in Google packing ChromeOS into a LiveCD type set up we could test/install on our own computers... (*Yes, I know of Chromium, haven't tried it yet... But I would prefer it coming direct from Google, faster updates and all that). It could be interesting to try out another of Google's OSs without having to fork over several hundred for new hardware... The only problem would be drivers to support the various hardware. If not modified too much, ChromeOS could possibly use the original Gentoo Linux drivers. But with Fuchsia using its own unique kernel... That might throw things off a bit... I know a few less tech-savey individuals who would probably be more comfortable if the same OS powered their phone, tablet and desktop (should Google opt to replace Android with Fuchsia). Especially if it could run both Android apps and Chrome extensions natively. Zxyon Rhysivz This could be the beginning of distros for Android. *Imagines Ubuntu Android* Peter World Citizen This will run in parallel with Android.

More than 35 million Americans will speak to these internet-connected speakers at least once a month this year, more than double the number in 2016, with tech-savvy millennials leading adoption, the EMarketer said in its first forecast of the burgeoning market. About 71 percent will use Echo devices, with the Google Home speaker trailing at 24 percent. Amazon will remain the dominant player for the next couple of years, even as Google narrows the gap, because it got such an early lead, EMarketer analyst Martin Utreras said. "Consumers are becoming increasingly comfortable with the technology, which is driving engagement,” he added. “As prices decrease and functionality increases, consumers are finding more reasons to increase adoption." Indeed, a separate study released Monday shows Amazon’s $50 Echo Dot, the cheapest version of the speaker, is helping boost adoption. The low-cost Dot, which Amazon introduced last year, is enticing consumers to try the technology. The model represents more than half of the 10.7 million Echo devices sold since they were introduced, according to a report by Consumer Intelligence Research Partners. “The Echo Dot definitely helped drive Echo sales since the release of the second generation model in October 2016,” said Josh Lowitz, co-founder of the research firm. “Amazon priced it aggressively, offered big discounts during the holiday season, and offered promotions for purchasing multiple units to encourage gifting and multi-room home use.” Exclusive insights on technology around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology. Sign Up Amazon unveiled the Echo, a cylindrical speaker that lets users stream music, dim lights, and order pizza by voice, in 2014. The devices cost as much as $200 and have become a surprise hit for a company that had struggled with some of its other consumer hardware efforts. Alphabet Inc.’s Google answered with its $115 Home device two years later. The gadgets target the house, when people might not have a smartphone handy and where portability isn’t an issue. Voice-based assistants, such as Apple Inc.’s Siri, are commonly accessed via smartphones. Amazon will "double down" on its investments in Echo devices and the underlying Alexa voice-activated system this year, CFO Brian Olsavsky said on a recent earnings call. The company in April announced the latest Echo variation, called the Echo Look, a $200 hands-free camera designed for dressing rooms that takes photos and video on voice command so users can assess their outfits from every angle. The device also lets users submit photos of two outfits to get a recommendation on the best one. The company will soon unveil a new Echo that features a display.

Google's "Fuchsia" operating system is taking shape with a new design Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/08 10:01am PDTMay 8, 2017 29 Plus 1 on G+ 243 Share on Facebook 78 Share on Twitter Total Shares350 Development Google News We first talked about Fuchsia, a new operating system being developed at Google, back in August (in fact, it was my first post here). At the time, there wasn't much to get excited about besides the potential - it only had a command-line interface. Now the project has a snazzy new, but clearly unfinished, interface. Summary of Fuchsia First, it's worth going over exactly what Fuchsia is, because it's been quite a while since we talked about it. As opposed to all of Google's other OSes, such as Android and Chrome OS, Fuchsia uses the company's new 'Magenta' kernel instead of Linux. According to the project's documentation, Magenta is designed for "modern phones and modern personal computers with fast processors, non-trivial amounts of ram with arbitrary peripherals doing open ended computation." Magenta's apps and the system interface are written with Google's Flutter SDK, which was initially designed to create cross-platform apps for iOS and Android. Flutter applications are written in Dart, the company's home-grown programming language. All of the system and apps are rendered by 'Escher,' which uses OpenGL or Vulkan to display everything. The 'Armadillo' interface So, on to the new stuff. Fuchsia's system UI has a new name - 'Armadillo.' Ars Technica was able to compile Armadillo into an Android APK, since it is written with the above-mentioned Flutter SDK. The interface doesn't really do anything besides looking pretty, but it does give us an idea of what the finished product could look like. The home screen is a vertical list, with a profile picture, the time, and a battery indicator in the center. Tapping the profile picture brings up something similar to Android's Quick Settings, with toggles for auto-rotate, do not disturb, Airplane Mode, and so on. Above the profile picture is the 'Story,' which the documentation describes as "a set of apps and/or modules that work together for the user to achieve a goal." Currently, this works similarly to Android's Recents screen. Users will also be able to combine stories into a 'Story Cluster.' This is what dragging a Story card into split-screen looks like. Dragging a Story card onto another one triggers a split-screen mode. The user can split an app 50/50 vertically or horizontally, drag in another app for a 33/33/33 split, or even have a tab bar appear for using all the open apps in full-screen. You can even have two apps split vertically next to two other split apps, seen below. This is far more flexible than Android's current multi-tasking functionality, but whether or not it will stay this way is uncertain. Below the profile picture is a panel resembling Google Now, with a placeholder search bar and suggestion cards. Armadillo's documentation says, "a suggestion is a representation of an action the user can take to augment an existing story or to start a new one. [The] suggestion contains enough information to create the visual representation of that concept." So maybe they will work more like an app launcher? It's hard to tell at this point. The Google Now panel, showing Fuchsia's keyboard. Keep in mind that all of this is subject to change, as the Armadillo interface (and the rest of Fuchsia OS) is still under heavy development. It's also hard to tell what Google's plans are for the operating system. Will it be neglected to Internet-of-Things devices and other basic hardware, or will it some day replace Android altogether? We'll have to wait and see.

Suicide_Note Because Google can. Corbin Davenport Ron from Ars Technica put it best: "Fuchsia really seems like a project that asks 'how would we design Android today, if we could start over?' It's a brand-new, Google-developed kernel running a brand-new, Google-developed SDK that uses a brand-new, Google-developed programming language and it's all geared to run Google's Material Design interface as quickly as possible. Google gets to dump Linux and the GPL, it can dump Java and the problems it caused with Oracle, and Google can basically insulate itself from all of Android's upstream projects and bring all the development in-house. Doing such a thing on the scale of Android today would be a massive project." makapav Would it still be open source? Also, what would happen to all the existing APKs? Corbin Davenport Fuchisa is completely open source right now. As for running Android apps, maybe Google will add some kind of stop-gap compatibility layer for running Android apps, like Chrome OS has. destinyhud read the article Suicide_Note Perhaps instead of replacing Android, this will *become* Android, as in Android P or Q? Or be the merger of Android/Chrome? m477 I could see that as Android 10. Definitely too early for P. morteum I wonder if the reason it is called "Armadillo" is because they're starting from A again, but this time they're using animals instead of desserts. Christopher Bement I think it's a smart plan, based on the guess that there's more animals to pick from in the world than tasty desserts. teolinux Ubuntu docet Paul "Tasty treats," not necessarily desserts. That said, armadillos could be a tasty treat. I won't judge. MJ I have heard desserts and candy used before which are wrong but "tasty treats" is a new one for me. To be more accurate, Android names are actually all confectionery foods. A "tasty treat" could be a slice of pizza (aka Android S). LOL Randy Gindy Armadillo is the name of the UI not the OS build itself. Matt74UK Smooth on the inside, crunchy on the outside. Armadillo ! (a few UK people of a certain age may get that). John Doe Idk this is a whole new OS with a new kernel, I doubt this will be done with an OTA update for Android. Mantas Pakėnas Even nowadays, some of Android's new functionality cannot be done via OTA updates (like dual system partitions, forced encryption I believe, etc). To make a completely hard cut sometime when this is ready, and if it's meant to replace Android, is not completely unimaginable. As is updating via OTA. If apple was able to change their file system via OTA, I don't see why changing most of the parts would not be possible. However, nobody aside from Google would do it, almost guaranteed :) Suicide_Note It could likely be done for Pixel devices, and possibly for future devices released after this new version of the OS rolls out. Adrian Meredith quite possibly, after all there no reason it couldn't also run android apps jonathan What they need to do is make this googles very own os for their pixel line and leave android for the oems Suicide_Note Not a chance. To much name recognition with Android for Google to drop it in favor of something else specific to the Pixel lineup. Dallas King Android Z confirmed! Suicide_Note More like Android A for Armadillo. m477 APK plz (no, really, I want a compiled apk the demo) Maxwell “Max” Weinbach https://github.com/fuchsia-mirror/sysui MJ Your link wasn't what the OP asked for... Maxwell “Max” Weinbach the only way to get the APK is to compile it yourself, so I linked to the Github page to a place to download the files to compile. The closest they will get. MJ Than you should have replied there is no known APK or not at all. Maxwell “Max” Weinbach It does not matter that much. I am building the APK right now. Once it is done I will post it. Here is the link on how to compile it. http://www.hotfixit.net/single-post/2017/05/03/How-to-build-Armadillo MJ Don't waste your time... They updated that article with an download of the APK. Maxwell “Max” Weinbach thanks. they just did that. I still compiled it myself though. I will try to get more out of it while I have the Sysui downloaded.

No thank you, we already had enough with this Pixel crud. I hope this OS dies quicker or become a chromebook OS. m477 It's open source. Latex beats nudity It's OSS but just like Android It'll be more heavily dependent on the google APIs to make it work. Look at the Pixel SysUI, Just being OSS doesn't make it open source... It's Google's OS not a Linux Based one. If this is going to replace Android It's doomsday on multiple levels. destinyhud billions of people dont care if its running linux kernel or not. maybe very few like u might. do iphone users care why kernel it runs. none of them care. u r just noise tbh Latex beats nudity Billions of people don't code. You are being a kool-aid joke tbh. destinyhud exaclt only few code and even on that few many dont care if it runs linux or not. look at iphone there are more dev there and yet they dont care for kernel. u r delusional in ur own world m477 Android it's already been on a Google-dependent road for years. I don't think this is going to change either way. An Angry Chihuahua https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/magenta/+/master/docs/getting_started.md heres the source code. do some research my dude WitnessG Imagining this running on a Google made processor is exciting. Badouken If this was the OS for the Pixel 2 alongside a Google made processor I think id cry! WitnessG Yeah I don't see this coming out for at least another 2-3 years. Badouken Indeed, but we can dream! ha Suicide_Note Maybe the Pixel 3 or 4 will see the dream become reality. Suicide_Note I'm betting this is what we'll see in a couple years time. As another commenter stated, starting with Armadillo could be Google's way of starting from the beginning (letter A codename), since there's more animal babes to use for each letter than there are dessert names to use. Timothy Vreeland You are getting the furries excited. Nomaan Armadillo should be compared to holo/material and not to dessert names. nachofrand What makes you think Google would be good at making SoCs? They're a software company and don't have the hardware expertise for hardcore ASIC development like that. Granted they can hire people, but in the end, does it matter? They're going to use ARM either way. UnlikeABoss Google fanboyism. The same reason he's excited over a brand new OS. He knows absolutely nothing about it, short of the fact that it will create more fragmentation not only in the OS space, but also the kernel space. So all we know are negative things so far. This is what we call exciting now is it? Why? Just because Google is doing it? If Microsoft made this exact same announcement, would we all be excited? Oh dear. Zsolt V No, because essentially everybody loathes Microsoft. Almost nobody's life would be worse if Microsoft vanished. marcusmarcus2 Don't they design and build their own servers to use for all their websites? Seems like those hardware work well for them. Sergii Pylypenko It's one thing to assemble the server using off-the-shelf components, or even to order a custom motherboard. It's a very different thing to design and manufacture your own chips. marcusmarcus2 I'm not saying it is the same, just that they are not only software experts. Them designing and building the servers show they do have hardware expertise that could assist them in doing the same to chips. Zsolt V Except Google's servers are not assembled from off the shelf components. Haven't been for a few years now. Roy What about TPU? Adrian Vovk Samsung Exynos devices are faster than Snapdragon, iPhones seem underpowered but are extremely snappy, etc. The point is that making both the software and hardware leads to a very fast ecosystem. Also, Google are making the TPU for neural networks nachofrand Yes, as expected. Exynos is faster than Snapdragon on the Galaxy phones, but put an Exynos in another phone...oh wait, you can't. That's the whole entire point. Snapdragon SoCs are general purpose SoCs and can be used for a multitude of phones so they're not custom tuned to every phone individually. Exynos have very specific power rails and the chip is made specifically for that phone. The thing is, sure this is better, but it's marginal and hardly worth talking about. They both use the same ARM architecture so performance gains are pretty negligible. Besides that, this is how Samsung makes money....off of device sales. Google doesn't make money that way. That isn't their business model so at this point it doesn't make sense for them to build their own SoCs when they could just work closer with hardware companies. They make their own TPUs because it aligns with their business model. Adrian Vovk The instruction set doesn't really matter? I can have a 6700k and a 6500k and the 6700k will perform much better even though they are both amd64. With what Google is doing with the Pixels (still as snappy as day one here) I'm pretty sure they can optimize it further than Samsung does. They have made it run smoother in some cases on a chip that they didn't manufacture. If they made their own chip it would allow them many freedoms that they otherwise don't have = easier design of the device. I brought up the TPUs because that is experience in chip manufacturing Jason What makes you say iPhones are under powered ? Apples chips are some of the fastest around and are extremely powerful. Adrian Vovk Specs wise. They have much worse specs on paper and it would lead to a slower experience, except Apple can optimize it because they make both the chip and the OS Stephen Sharp They could use Risc-V and have to pay to license absolutely nothing, while being able to make processors purpose built for their OS Randy Gindy That would be an interesting move. Stephen Sharp Indeed, I really want Risc-V to succeed as an open ISA nachofrand They could. But in my opinion, it's unlikely. Google isn't trying to compete with Samsung and Apple in device sales and that isn't their business model. People using their services so they can show ads is their business model. It doesn't make sense for Google to make their own SoC when others are already doing a good job. Plus, if they went to RISC-V then what? What about the modem? They have to buy a standalone modem from Qualcomm or Intel. Now you have to hire system integration and test engineers to make sure the modem is working with your SoC. Oh and then you need a whole firmware team to control the modem. At that point, buy a full blown SoC with the modem on chip. Stephen Sharp Eh you lost me at "Pixel phone" and all the other hardware they sell. Google also is a Platinum member of the Risc-V foundation, and if there is a direction they are going, more control or less control, I would guess it's "more". But that's just a guess nachofrand Hardware isn't even close to the same thing as asic development. IC design is a different world. Granted they do some custom hardware, but SoCs are a much much larger feat. It's still a possibility they do so, but it doesn't make sense with their current business model imo. Captain On! 1 - Google has stated that they're going to make their own silicon for the Pixels in time. 2 - Google actually owns/operates the world's most powerful quantum computer. They know how to make chips. Randy Gindy That quantum computer was built by DWave though Angel I read (somewhere don’t remember) that they have three different quantum computers systems. One from DWave and two home-produced. From those two, one was made by engineers and not that disimilar from DWave in its operations. The other was made by physicists and uses a different approach. nachofrand 1. I could be wrong, but I've only read that they plan on working closer with chip manufacturers. 2. Google didn't make that computer. Even if they did, quantum is so different those skills don't even translate. Romario Maxwell Google made their own custom ASIC called the Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) for their AI/Machine Learning needs on their cloud platform. See https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2016/05/Google-supercharges-machine-learning-tasks-with-custom-chip.html and https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2017/04/quantifying-the-performance-of-the-TPU-our-first-machine-learning-chip.html nachofrand Sure, although a TPU is just an accelerator. Think of it as the hexagon DSP inside of the Snapdragon SoC. That's like 1/10 of the entire chip. SoC design is much larger. Timothy Vreeland How many examples of hardware design do people have to point out before you stop? Sure the hardware they worked on previously isn't exactly the same... But before they started the hardware they are currently working on, they worked on previous hardware that wasn't the same as what they are doing now. They have shown they are competent in designing many kinds of hardware. Or do you suggest a company can only build one kind of hardware and nothing else for all eternity? How did Samsung make it's current in-house chips? Did they go to ARM college? Have they been making ARM chips since the dawn of time? No. They put together some teams and got to work, so stop blabbing and being negative. sweenish Their AI that finally beat the world's top Go players was running on custom Google chips. It's not like they don't know how. Pixelexel Imagine a Google Pixel with a Google made processor, with Fuschia, with Project Fi with Google WiFi powered by Google fiber. If I'd have this, my life would be complete. Iamsecond Ha, no. A Google processor? Supported for 18 months, then replaced with a new processor that performs half as well (but has stickers.) Does not fully process Android code, because at Google one hand doesn't even know the other hand is there, let alone talk to it. Has 20 cores (only 2 enabled outside US for 'reasons.') Has a dedicated co-processor to enable ads in every app, even those that previously didn't have them. Jason Google can't even get a phone out the door without issues and you want them to make the chips too...lol. I'll pass. UnlikeABoss "In house kernel instead of Linux". Yeah, hopefully this dies in a thousand pits of fire. "Hey Linux guys, you know how you've helped us make billions over the years with a free open source kernel? Well, we were just using you to get the "nerd" userbase. Now we own the market thanks to you guys promoting its use of Linux, we will gradually phase you out." .... m477 I hope not. Linux is not really a kernel made with smartphone in minds. I don't care for being a fan of a kernel over another. UnlikeABoss Yeah. I'd much rather use a brand new untested kernel (and all the teething issues that will come with it) in my smartphone than a mature, stable one that's hacked on by hundreds and thousands of people every month. I mean, it's just a smartphone, we don't need it to be a secure environment, right? Let's just make a nice obscure kernel that no one else will use, and just say "but but it's open source!!! love us because we are Google kk". ... ihsan ışık I'm sorry but it just looks like you are a huge Linux fan and are just against change to me. UnlikeABoss Looks can be deceiving. If you're going to fling around the Linux fanboy term, i'll fling around the Google fanboy term, and that will surely be a nice constructive argument that we will both want to continue. m477 So, in 10 years we should still be using an unoptimised kernel like Linux, because anything newer is, well, newer? UnlikeABoss Yeah, because Linux hasn't changed at all in 10 years... m477 Yes, it changed a lot, and it still has many of the same problems, which are intrinsically bound to its structure. It's not a kernel well suited for mobile devices. UnlikeABoss You think the solution is to throw it out the window and start from scratch? I disagree. I'd much rather continue improving the Linux kernel, simply because of all the eyes it will always have on its code. jonathan Play nice ladies lol m477 With this mentality we wouldn't have Linux at all. Why start anything, while we can continue this other thing which purpose was completely different? A mircokenel is more well suited than a monolitic kernel to a mobile devices, both in terms of performance and security. No matter how much you improve Linux, it will never be a microkernel. UnlikeABoss Smartphones don't need a micro kernel in 2017. You could make that argument 7 years ago. Linux can be compiled with the required drivers just like it always could. m477 I made that argument 7 years ago. They always needed something different from Linux. The fact that specific, even proprietary drivers have to be integrated in the kernel (since Android lacks an abstraction layer) is on of the problems of the interaction Android-Linux. destinyhud why havent the nerds made linux on pc's a bigger market share if they were the one who made android a global leader UnlikeABoss No nerd is promoting Linux on the desktop. All social media used to be full of people promoting Android over iOS, these days there's no need to. destinyhud why havent they promoted desktop?? just wondering why they did for android but not for desktop.. linux on desktop was an underdog for decades. android was not popular because of kernal. android became popular because it was opensource and was the only viable competition to ios. people dont care what kernel it runs. UnlikeABoss No nerd worth their salt would promote an environment that would be a downgrade from Windows. Android was not a downgrade from iOS at any point in time, it had a very equal playing field. There's a difference between promoting a good solid FOSS kernel where possible, and promoting an agenda. m477 Android was not a downgrade from iOS at any point in time By this, I get that you never used Android and iOS side by side in 2009-10. UnlikeABoss You clearly value different things. The hackability alone made it an upgrade through its lifetime. m477 The same can be said for GNU/Linux on desktop. UnlikeABoss No it can't, because hackability =/= app availability. i.e. The hackability on Linux desktop doesn't make it win over it's lack of apps, where that isn't an issue on Android. m477 App availability was horrible in the early days, compared to iOS. Even Symbian had more apps. UnlikeABoss That was fine since the early days didn't consist of using your smartphone for very much, due to under powered hardware. Techies didn't go around saying "use iOS because we can all take selfies and stick filters on it". m477 iOS devices didn't have front cameras until mid 2010. The system was better, faster, smoother, the interface was coesive, there were many more apps, and the jailbreak community, to address the techie audience you like to go on about so much, was very, very good. There were tweaks and modifications that even the wildest Android custom ROM didn't have at the time. Android was objectively a downgrade, as much as Linux was on desktop. UnlikeABoss Calling jailbraik an advantage over a FOSS OS is pretty hilarious. iOS wasn't popular because it was better, it was popular because of the amount of people getting their advice from paid employees in store. "Buy iOS so we get a commission". m477 iPhone was more popular for various reasons: marketing, having 2 years of advantage, and, yes, more marketing. But it was also better than Android, as an OS. What benefit did Android bring, with it being opensource, compared to iOS, even to a "techie"? The dev community was laughable in the early days. Why GNU/Linux on desktop was not promoted by "techies" (which is false) and Android was, even if their shortcomings were identical? destinyhud u live in a dream world. even most dev dont care about kernel. what they care about the dev platform. I am a dev and i dont care for the kernel UnlikeABoss If you're talking from the perspective of an app developer then ofcourse you don't care about the kernel, you care about which platform will make you the most money... destinyhud exactly. no one care what kernel it runs.. all dev care is what platform make money. so who is this nerd who care about kernel if most dont care about the kernel.. yeah very very few.. infact rare like u UnlikeABoss Techie == Technology Enthusiast. You can sit here and tell me that you would use the best dev environment all you want but the truth is if the iOS dev environment was awful you'd still suck it up and use it to make your money. I'm not sure how you can class yourself as an enthusiast at that point. destinyhud ever wonder why no one is up voting u and upvoting many of my comments? because what u say is BS. its that simple. I am up for ditching outdated linux if the new kernal is modern and build for modern devices. most dont care for this very few techies.. i hope this becomes true and linux kernel die.. UnlikeABoss "Ever wonder why Google fanboys upvote pro Google content and not anti-Google content?" No, no I don't wonder that. How dare someone critique a pointless change by Google, causing unnecessary fragmentation. Burn them! destinyhud u must be new here.. look at anti google comments here when they make stupid changes but if they make welcome changes people tend to agree UnlikeABoss No, I've been here a long time and made many anti-Google comments as well as pro-Google. No one in the right mind would cheer on kernel fragmentation other than those that think Google can do no wrong. destinyhud open up ur comments history and let me see if u made pro google comments. i have a feeling u r a troll UnlikeABoss Yeah, this discussion is going no where. You are not the authority here and the idea that you want to browse my history to make sure I fall in line is creepy as hell. Bye. destinyhud lol i see u dont want to open ur comments history. obvious troll m477 outdated linux i hope this becomes true and linux kernel die Woah, wait a second here. Linux is not outdated, and its death would be terrible for everyone. It's just that it's not the most apt kernel for a mobile device. destinyhud maybe not outdated but not the right fit for mobile devices. destinyhud android sucked when compared to ios.. it was a downgrade compared to ios. why did dev promote android and not desktop linux? u reasoning dont even make sense. UnlikeABoss No, it wasn't a downgrade. destinyhud yes, it was back in android initial release. iOS was better and much more polished at that time. but things changed now. UnlikeABoss "Polished" is not a factor that is used to judge a better OS. There are Linux environments that are much more polished than Windows 10, but that doesn't make desktop Linux better. destinyhud it was both polished and runs better than android at that time. polished was not the only one. it was also polished. android only got better later.. i have used android at that time and it sucked big time. UnlikeABoss You are using today's standards to judge it. If you do that, they both sucked. It worked perfectly fine for the basic things people were using it for at the time. destinyhud they both sucked at that time but android sucked more than iOS at that time. SVem26 I like to think I am in the nerd userbase and I don't care what kernel is used.. can you help me understand why it matters? UnlikeABoss Do you want a brand new obscure kernel in thing that holds most of your sensitive details? TipTop I don't want something that dates back to 90s, is full of zero-days and horrible code contributed by nobodies. UnlikeABoss The idea that it is full of zero days is hilarious. You do realize that the majority of Linux exploits are local, right? Unlike Windows. Yes there is obviously code from the 90s, but very, very little of it. Not to mention that age is not a factor in deciding bad code. The idea that old code is bad code shows your inexperience. By that standard, should we dismiss Chrome because of all the exploits being found in code that was written when it first started? Are we going to create brand new software every few years to purge "old code"? Do you have any idea whatsoever how much Linux has actually changed? Do you have any idea how much of this change is because it's considered a "universal" kernel everyone can use and is focusing on? Do you really think splitting the community over onto another kernel will increase security for either of those kernels? There's a little something called code maturity. There's a reason Microsoft has way less exploits in its kernel today than 10 years ago. They didn't write a new kernel from scratch. Sir_Brizz All OSes are full of vulnerabilities and horrible code written by nobodies. If that is your requirement then you must have gone full luddite by now. ihsan ışık Are you implying that Android got popular because of "nerds" who heard it uses the Linux kernel? UnlikeABoss If you are old enough to know the early days of android you'll know that having every single nerd on the internet promoting Android over iOS most certainly helped get the ball rolling. Once it was pushed, it snowballed into what it is today. m477 Sure. It was the nerds on the internet, not the manufacturers with ads everywhere. Most people still don't know their Galaxy runs Android. UnlikeABoss The giant billboards came YEARS afterwards, cmon. m477 Yes, and that's why Android was so unpopular in the early days. UnlikeABoss What? It was massively popular among all techies for being the open source iOS alternative. m477 You are overestimating the "techies" crowd. Even BlackBerryOS was more popular at the time. Only after the Galaxy S it started to grow, and became popular among normal people. UnlikeABoss Not really. We are talking over a decade ago now, there were far less people on the internet and it was far easier for techies to promote products because everyone was asking their "techie" friend what is best. But these days everyone is an "expert" so that's not as much of a thing. m477 Again, you overestimate how many techies there actually were. Your personal experience is anecdotal. Market shares and sell data are objective. Also, over a decade ago Android was still a camera os, and it wasn't public. UnlikeABoss No, I do not. The further back in time you go, the higher the proportion of techies there were using the internet versus others. People were only just starting to look at buying a smartphone, and asking techies what they should buy. m477 Yes, the concentration on the internet of "techies" on the internet was greater. And? What normal user at the time went to the internet, looked at reviews and said "Oh, look! The HTC magic has Linux! This random guy says its good, so I'm gonna buy it!"? You really think that a bunch of "techies">marketing? A guy saying that his toy-looking HTC G1 is better than the iPhone is more effective than billboards and tv ads? Come on, even Windows Mobile was more popular. It took Samsung's aggressive marketing to make Android popular. UnlikeABoss Windows Mobile and BlackBerry were more popular in the enterprise, that's it. The entire discussion is home users. Also I think there's been some confusion. I wasn't implying that techies on the internet were promoting Android on the internet like a marketing department. I was implying that the internet was very much a "social media" platform for techies to communicate where the majority of them would use Android and mocked the use of iOS. The actual "marketing" happened offline when a normal user would ask their "techie" friend for first time buying advice. It is nothing like that today, and the internet is nothing like the techie community it once was. m477 So, what you're saying is that the internet was a circlejerk of Android users. Ok, and? It didn't affected normal users the slightest, iOS was still more popular until Samsung took Android more seriously. The techie friend thing its only your anecdotal experience, it bears no influence on the market, in the grand scheme of things. I'd even argue that Google's very light marketing did much, much more. Also, the mindless techies that recommended half backed devices instead of better alternatives because "Uh, Linux!!" did more harm than good, both to the users and to Android. UnlikeABoss If you read my OP you'll see my original point was that Google has rode the "Android circlejerk" to popularity, and you can debate how much popularity that added as much as you want. The fact remains, it got the ball rolling. Samsung didn't pick it up "just because", it saw that a lot of people were pushing it. There were several OS at the time it could have used, including sticking to its own. Why bother with Android? Maybe because it wanted to see how much market it could take by appealing to techies? However, if you stand back and look at it, how is this any different from "embrace, extend, extinguish"? Google used that "free marketing" and has now decided to use it's massive popularity to push a different product. (Which has failed in the past and will hopefully fail again). Why hate Microsoft for doing that in the past, but we praise Google for doing it? Why are we excited for something we know nothing about that is creating fragmentation? m477 Samsung had used several OSes, it had Windows Mobile and Phone devices, Symbian devices, and proprietary devices, even Palm OS devices IIRC. They used them all. Android had was the easiest to personalise for them, and create a copy of the best selling product, which was the iPhone, and there was an app market, so they tried to release and market their flagship with it, and market it as broadly as Apple. The first Galaxy (the "non S") was was vastly ignored, because it was as little marketed as all their other devices. The techies crowd was insignificant. The free marketing is just as much as Windows 10 gets for incorporating Ubuntu's bash terminal. What you saw is not really important. I saw lots and lots of Windows Phones in 2010 and 11. Many more than Android devices. Every one I knew had one, and if I had to say which OS was the most popular only based on my personal experience, in my smallish city, I'd obviously would say Windows Phone. Why are you so attached to Linux, excluding all possibilities of giving a possibly better solution a try? The community will just fork the AOSP and continue the development of the Linux branch. UnlikeABoss Cmon, we both know Android was not easier for them to customize than simply using their own OS. No one was recommending it, techie or not, no matter how much they marketed. It's only now they are popular they are trying to slip in their own OS, and still failing. I am not attached to Linux despite people using it as an easy scapegoat to dismiss a discussion critiquing almighty Google. We currently have a situation where most kernel developers focus entirely on Linux, making it virtually the universal kernel. Why are we creating pointless fragmentation there? Why divide that community? Do we honestly believe that a divided community can produce a better kernel, or do we love it because Google is doing it? Would we love it if Microsoft did this? m477 The proprietary OS they used at the time was a Java based thing with a flash interface. Hardly able to compete against iOS. It was easier for them to use the "next Symbian" that they could customise as they wanted, and that also had an app market. If they made, say, Bada, before Android become established and popular, and marketed it as much as they did with their Galaxy S, the market would be very different today. The normal user doesn't care what OS their shiny phone runs, as long as there's facebook. I am a GNU/Linux user since the first half of the 2000s, and I've always critiqued Google for using Linux as a kernel on phones. Linux might be the universal kernel, but smartphones need a more streamlined solution. I don't care if it's Google, the MIT, or Richard Stallman in person to do it. I liked WP8 architecture. Fragmentation is not pointless if it brings benefits to the user. TipTop Nobody cares about your FSF agenda. John Q I think the chief reason Google is not using Linux is that they want a real-time OS (RTOS). Linux is at best a "soft" RTOS, possessing a real-time scheduler but this is still not nearly as real-time as an actual RTOS should be. It would take a very large effort to do that for Linux so it makes sense that Google would want to make their own kernel that they can have full control over. UnlikeABoss Let's ignore the fact that Linux is used in real time car systems for a moment. Could you elaborate on why you think Google would want/need a RTOS on their smartphones? M6 The kernel they're using, 'magenta', is opened source. So who cares if they're using linux or not? Does everyone have to use linux? UnlikeABoss No it doesn't have to be Linux. But who else will use Magenta? Probably no one. So why are we fragmenting the kernel space further? Why would you choose an immature kernel for something as valuable (your data) as your smartphone. Would you trust that? I would much rather developers continue focusing on a single kernel. WesleySmalls But wouldn't Magenta be this single kernel? UnlikeABoss If everyone decided to ditch Linux and focus purely on Magenta as the universal kernel, yes. Will that happen? WesleySmalls Could be, just not overnight. The market was already fairly well developed when Linux arrived in 1991, yet it still managed to become a very, if not the most, important player in the market. It's certainly possible, it will just require proper investment(and neglect of their alternate platforms) and patience to make it work M6 That's some straight up communist shit right there. Let's just work on one thing, because we only need one thing, everything else is redundant! Let's not allow other people to do the same thing in a different way, because competition totally doesn't spur innovation at all. WORPspeed So Andromeda definitely dead or still happening? sleepinlight Pretty sure this IS Andromeda, or at least a part of it. Andromeda was never an official name for anything, it was just the internal project name for some sort of new and/or merged OS. WORPspeed I thought Andromeda specifically referred to merging Android and Chrome OS. So is that specific merger dead or on life-support? John Q Nah, the Android/Chrome merger was just speculation from what Andromeda seemed to be. There was never any concrete evidence to imply that Andromeda was a merger. WORPspeed To quote Androidpolice : "So please, when you see Fuchsia mentioned, or speculation that it "is" Andromeda, know that it is just that: speculation. Last we heard from sources we consider extremely reliable, Android was the basis of Andromeda, and Andromeda would see its commercial debut on a new Pixel laptop later this year. It is possible Google has changed plans around Andromeda, that the initiative itself may have even been scrapped. Though, we have no reason to think so - it's more that we don't know, and haven't heard anything about Andromeda in quite some time." http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/02/15/speculation-around-googles-fuchsia-os-and-andromeda-is-creating-confusion-and-misinformation/ WORPspeed http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/02/15/speculation-around-googles-fuchsia-os-and-andromeda-is-creating-confusion-and-misinformation/ That makes them seem very separate Srujan https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/e7fda716dfcfdca76e200e51a9c9144c72e183c7e76d36b910c20ee0931aee79.gif destinyhud if this replaces android rather than having 2 separate codebase, I am all up for it. splitting the android community is dangerous senor_heisenberg Well if this does end up being what replaces Android or what Android evolves into, I just hope my apps and whatnot are compatible. Ain't got the time or money to be investing into another ecosystem. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman That's a tricky, double-edged sword. I can't fathom they would not support the old apps, or at least the vast majority of them, for exactly that reason. But in doing so it will likely be held back at least slightly from what it can/should be. Backward-compatibility tends to hold everything back. What I'd wager is we won't see this until hardware's powerful enough to make emulating the old system in a VM relatively cheap and easy, with back-end Play Store penalties to developers who don't shift to the new app models, and then slow phase-outs in stages of the older functionality and support until the new OS is running exclusively its own setup. senor_heisenberg That sounds good. Randy Gindy I think Google porting the Android Run-time to Chrome OS was to see if they could do it. morteum This is old news, I'm waiting for Fuchsia 2.0 Barracuda. /s marcusmarcus2 What if they aren't going by Animal names in general but by mammal names. I'd skip the Fuchsia 2.0 Bandicoot. It will probably be "Crash" prone. Alfonso Surroca Three operating systems is not nearly enough. We need at least two more announced at I/O.

Suicide_Note There is no update problem. Nexus/Pixels run the latest and greatest. OEMs who mess with the OS give their customers severely delayed updates. pfmiller Nexus and Pixels run the latest and greatest for two years. Nobody would accept this OS update situation if it was on a desktop OS. MJ Thank God it's phones we are talking about and not a desktop PC. marcusmarcus2 That is exactly why Windows XP lasted only a couple years before all computers updated to Windows 7... Seriously though. I'm fine with only getting Android version upgrades phones for 2 years. But they really need to extend out security updates beyond 3 years. Suicide_Note This isn't a desktop OS, not to mention people tend to change phones much more often than their desktops. pfmiller Sure it's not a desktop OS, but no sense pretending that what we have leaves nothing to be desired. And sure people change their phones more often that their desktops, but there's absolutely no reason to change every 2 years. Doby Gillis Which is a problem, Einstein. Suicide_Note Not if you're a Nexus/Pixel owner, Dilbert. Randy Gindy I would generally say there is. Android phones are not supported for nearly as long as an iPhone. The reason being that the chip set manufacturers do not release new drivers. Shelly-Man Vol 2 It's looks pretty neat for a development stage. Rami Well Android has to reach Z someday. In the case, Hello Fuchsia! marcusmarcus2 Those split-screens will be really useful for running of of Google's different messaging apps. Hopefully OS's aren't the new messaging apps of Google.

You can install it just as any other apk WesleySmalls "Will it be neglected to Internet-of-Things devices and other basic hardware, or will it some day replace Android altogether?" Neither, this is just a side project many developers use to test and work out the feasability of a variety of things. Android is a very well developed environment, and replacing it whole is simply a no-go. Things will just gradually evolve, as they have already done with Dalvik being replaced by ART, for example. Sir_Brizz I don't think you're wrong, but it would be in Google's best interest to start building a non-JVM runtime that apps can run inside with a native language that Google has 100% full control over like Go or Dart. Тарас Мукин 1. This is definetelly Chat UI! It came from Telegram bots and whatsoever, and it is so smart of Google to be developing it now. Feels like it's going to be next big UI-change after Apple came up with apps divided into screens. 2. "Magenta is designed for ... non-trivial amounts of ram" This is going to be optimised sooo bad. Alex De La Rosa I bet theyll announce 2 new messaging apps along with that PI 5 msg Apps for 3 Os is dam low ,,,, expecting it to be 10 Calvin Wankhede That guy who bought fuchsiapolice.com sure is waiting for his investment to pay off, isn't he? Nicolas Bahamondes Fuchsia Police... Alvin My money is on this turning into a really useful and innovative messaging app. Oh, with stickers. Superman Not happening, just like module phone. Lol Cyber Jethro I personally think this is for embedded systems like shopping kiosks or other customer service applications. Zach Mauch "Will it be neglected to Internet-of-Things devices and other basic hardware" Did you mean "relegated", not "neglected"? PVL_93_RU Those "stories" on the "home screen" look like they'd fit perfectly for a kiosk-type display, where you have a lot of space to work with JG Fuchsia is a purple-y pink color. T-Mobile's color is Magenta, a slightly different purple-y pink color T-Mobile is rumored to be looking into launching their own phone... Coincidence??? Almost certainly, without a doubt yes... But consider... T-Mobile also launched the first Android phone... yoloswag Inspired by the messaging team, Google wants to start working on a 2nd operating system. JG Magenta is designed for "modern phones and modern personal computers with fast processors, non-trivial amounts of ram with arbitrary peripherals doing open ended computation." Modern personal computers huh? I've been interested in Google packing ChromeOS into a LiveCD type set up we could test/install on our own computers... (*Yes, I know of Chromium, haven't tried it yet... But I would prefer it coming direct from Google, faster updates and all that). It could be interesting to try out another of Google's OSs without having to fork over several hundred for new hardware... The only problem would be drivers to support the various hardware. If not modified too much, ChromeOS could possibly use the original Gentoo Linux drivers. But with Fuchsia using its own unique kernel... That might throw things off a bit... I know a few less tech-savey individuals who would probably be more comfortable if the same OS powered their phone, tablet and desktop (should Google opt to replace Android with Fuchsia). Especially if it could run both Android apps and Chrome extensions natively. Zxyon Rhysivz This could be the beginning of distros for Android. *Imagines Ubuntu Android* Peter World Citizen This will run in parallel with Android.

Akhter Gulfam / EPA / May 7, 2017 Pakistan and Afghanistan to use Google Maps to settle border row May 8, 2017 Updated: May 8, 2017 10:56 PM Related Key ISIL leader in Afghanistan confirmed killed Pakistan’s relations with the US are at a generational crossroads Topics: Pakistan Afghanistan Kandahar, Afghanistan // Pakistan and Afghanistan will use Google Maps to help settle a border dispute that led to deadly clashes last week, officials from both countries said on Monday. At least eight civilians were killed on both sides in fighting that began when a Pakistani census team accompanied by soldiers visited disputed villages along the border on Friday. Pakistan inherited its 2,400-kilometre border with its western neighbour when it gained independence from Britain in 1947, but Afghanistan has never formally recognised it. And while official Afghan maps reflect the so-called "Durand Line", many nationalists believe the true border of their country ends at the Indus River that runs though Pakistan and gave India its name. "Officials from the geological survey departments of the two countries will conduct a survey, and they will also make use of Google Maps," said a senior Pakistani security source in Islamabad. Abdul Razeq, the police chief of Afghanistan’s Kandahar province, added: "After negotiations, both sides have agreed that a geological survey should be conducted. "Technical teams of both countries will use GPS and Google Maps as well as other means to get the answer." Internet firm Google complies with local laws in certain countries that compel it to show borders in line with national demands. For instance, its Indian site shows the entirety of disputed Kashmir as controlled by India. In Pakistan, however, the site shows the internationally recognised de facto border, the Line of Control, marked with a dotted line to denote it is disputed. In 2010 Google was embroiled in a Central American border dispute that saw two neighbouring countries dispatch troops and heavily armed police to their joint border. The incident happened after a Nicaraguan commander cited Google’s version of the border map in an interview with Costa Rican newspaper La Nacion to justify a raid on a disputed area of Costa Rica. Google later said it had made a mistake and corrected its map to reflect one sanctioned by the US State Department. Pakistan last year began trying to harden the traditionally soft border with Afghanistan through trenching and fencing, but its efforts were met with hostility from Kabul. Ethnic Pashtuns living in the region have traditionally paid little heed to the border. Villages straddling the frontier have mosques and houses with one door in Pakistan and another in Afghanistan. Pakistani forces on Sunday elevated their rhetoric when they said they had also killed "more than 50 soldiers" in last week’s border clashes – a claim quickly rejected by Kabul, which said it lost two soldiers. * Agence France-Presse Pages: Add your comment View all comments More South Asia Pakistan and Afghanistan to use Google Maps to settle border row Solo Everest climber with no permit fined $22,000 85-year-old dies attempting to set Mount Everest record as oldest climber India upholds death sentence for four men who gang raped student MOST VIEWED World | All Israel moves to downgrade Arabic from official language status Macron honeymoon may be short-lived as France’s far-right and left prepare to do battle Syria says no to international force patrolling safe zones Palestinians dismiss claims hunger strike leader broke fast UN fears catastrophic fallout from proposed US funding cuts Macron becomes France’s youngest ever president in landslide victory Saudi Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s warning to Iran Pakistan and Afghanistan to use Google Maps to settle border row Christian man shot dead inside Egypt barbershop in ISIL-claimed attack After Trump and Brexit, Macron election provides EU with much-needed boost More Most Viewed New Dh12bn plan to bring arena and promenade to Yas Island Economic fears dominate the minds of Iranian voters UAE traffic: Eventful morning on Dubai roads with accidents in many areas Zaha Hadid’s first Dubai project The Opus is ahead of the curve Emirati doctors on the frontline of war Maradona managing Fujairah FC will boost tourism, say hoteliers Abu Dhabi schools expecting poor attendance during Ramadan Inside plans for the Dh12bn Yas Island development - in pictures Etihad Airways appoints interim group chief executive as Hogan stands down 10 injured at Jebel Ali Port as ship hits crane causing it to fall More Most Viewed Back to the top EDITOR'S PICKS Macron becomes France’s youngest ever president in landslide victory Calls for Omani law on child seats Fatal flaws in latest plan for safe zones in Syria World in focus — best photos for May 8, 2017 FOLLOW US Tweets by @TheNatWorld SPOTLIGHT Top-quality Dubai office rents to rise After Trump and Brexit, Macron election provides EU with much-needed boost Switch to Mobile Site About us Contact us Work with us Privacy policy Terms and conditions Advertise with us Subscribe Sitemap super.ae alittihad.ae thenational.ae anazahra.com ngalarabiya.com adtv.ae adradio.ae admedia.ae

The Summits will see over 200 publishers from across the region gather to get an opportunity to explore and better understand Google’s Publisher tools, as well as the challenges and opportunities presented by an online ecosystem growing rapidly in both size and complexity. These Summits are the largest hosted by Google in Africa, to date. Through its Summits, and other initiatives, Google is empowering publishers to make money online and drive traffic to their sites. In this way, the company aims to give publishers the necessary support to help them monetise their content online, thereby creating opportunities for the industry to leverage technology in the digital world. The Summits, which address the different issues being faced by publishers and advertisers, are designed to provide a more complete picture of the online ecosystem and the opportunities that lie ahead in 2017 and beyond. Key focus areas include the changing consumption journeys of online consumers as well as the tools available to publishers to optimise their benefits. With Google having achieved its 2016 goal of training 1 million young people in Africa on digital skills within a year, there is even greater need for high-interest published content for online marketing as these web enthusiasts start their own ventures or assist other web entrepreneurs with theirs. “Google’s relentless commitment to the growth and development of the people and businesses in Africa is given expression through summits like this as we deploy tools and initiatives to support businesses and individuals in Africa to grow,” says Google Nigeria Country Manager Juliet Ehimuan-Chiazor. Google enables publishers to sell their content directly to consumers through Google Play Newsstand, which now features some 4 000+ newspapers, magazines and blogs. And its search and ads services help publishers make money online and drive traffic to their sites. Google shared more than $11bn with its publisher partners in 2016. In October 2015 Google joined publishers, analytics and ad tech companies and others to announce the Accelerated Mobile Pages Project to dramatically improve the mobile web for everyone. “Google believes preserving a robust and independent press is important for society. When excellent journalism succeeds we all do better,” Ehimuan-Chiazor comments. “This is why Google helps journalists use technology for reporting and acts as a collaborator and convener to listen and learn from those in the industry.” Other initiatives driven by Google to assist publishers includes the Google News Lab, which collaborates with reporters and entrepreneurs globally to help build the future of journalism, partner on projects, and build and adapt tools like Google Trends to help them in their work. In 2016 Google trained over 100 000 journalists directly. In February 2016 it opened Operation Shield — a tool for news orgs and human rights groups to protect themselves from DDoS attacks — to all news organisations. “We boost content discovery and understanding through diversity tags like ‘opinion’, ‘highly cited’, ‘local’ and ‘fact check’ along with tools like ‘Editors’ Picks’ in Google News to allow editors to highlight original news content they believe represents their organisation’s best journalistic work,” says Ehimuan-Chiazor. “Online publishers are at the core of the web’s content industry, and it is crucial that they get all the support required for them to continue to “feed” the web with content, while also being assisted to grow their revenues and their businesses,” Ehimuan-Chiazor concludes.

Twitter Facebook Oracle's next big business is selling your info The tech titan’s Data Cloud is a boon for businesses, but raises privacy concerns IDG Blair Hanley Frank (IDG News Service) 09 May, 2017 04:44 - - - - print email Comments There’s a decent chance you're part of Oracle’s next big business. Not selling products to you, but selling you as a product. That's the idea behind the Oracle Data Cloud, a massive pool of information about consumers and companies. The tech titan has put it together by tracking people across the web and buying data from a variety of sources. People who have their data included may not even know that they’ve opted in for that data collection. There’s no big red button that someone has to click in order to be a part of the company's data collection machine. Instead, its base of user data is fed by a network of third parties. The Data Cloud is primarily fed by three types of sources: publishers, like Forbes and Edmunds, retail loyalty programs, and traditional data brokers like Experian and IHS. All of that adds up to a database of 5 billion consumer profiles, fed by 15 million data sources. Not every profile corresponds to a unique person -- people can have multiple profiles -- but Oracle has information on billions of people, according to Eric Roza, the vice president of Data Cloud. Using data science techniques, Oracle works to match activity from one browser to others, so companies can make sure the same ads get shown to people on their smartphones, tablets, and computers. Oracle sees Data Cloud as a key part of its future. The service is being used to help advertisers and publishers better target ads, and it’s attractive to businesses because it's not tied to a major advertising platform like Google's or Facebook's. The Data Cloud also forms the foundation of machine learning features inside other Oracle software. One of the challenges for companies doing machine learning is getting data sets that are large enough to build accurate models, and Data Cloud can help solve that problem. But the benefits are mostly borne by Oracle's business customers, who stand to make more money as a result of using Data Cloud enhanced services. The boon to consumers whose data are being used is less defined. Oracle isn't alone in this sort of tracking. There are dozens of companies that exist for the sole purpose of collecting consumer data and then reselling that to other businesses. Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and other tech titans have made big money from accumulating customer data and using it to sell ads. But what makes the Data Cloud different from something like Google's ad business is that consumers might not know their behavior is being stored for resale, or how broadly it's shared. Just because someone visits a page on Forbes doesn't mean they'd expect that information to influence a marketing campaign on a radically different website, but that's what the Data Cloud enables. Partners feeding data into Oracle's Data Cloud must agree they have user permission to collect information. But acquiring that permission is as simple as burying a few sentences deep in a privacy policy. While some might call out Oracle Data Cloud by name, most don't. "Typically, because these things are quite common practice now, there's a more generalized statement [like] some version of 'we use this data to inform our own advertising, and select third-party partners,'" Roza said. Users can opt out from the data collection in a variety of ways, according to Roza. Oracle allows people to install a special cookie in each of the browsers they use to prevent tracking. Deleting the cookie or using a new browser would erase that protection, however. Some publishers may allow customers to opt out of data sharing, and advertising industry groups also support opting out. But actually knowing whether or not you're included in the Data Cloud is the first part of the battle. And that's not the easiest thing to figure out. Meanwhile, Oracle is continuing to pour money into the business and tout it to customers. The company has spent billions on acquisitions to build the Data Cloud, which was created through bringing companies like BlueKai, Datalogix, and Moat into the fold.

Today, I’m going back to the Google Docs issue, but to look at it from a different angle: how scammers continue to use social engineering so successfully. An eSecurity Planet article touched on this: Fidelis Cybersecurity threat research manager John Bambenek said by email that the attack is a stark reminder that criminals and nation states are targeting the one thing technology can't fix -- the user. "If you can trick the user into compromising themselves, you have no need for a zero-day," he said. "Security awareness and vigilance of end users are the key to the security of any system." This echoes what Nathan Wenzler, chief security strategist at AsTech, told me in an email message. Hackers are using attacks such as ransomware and honed spearphishing campaigns to go after the weakest link: people, adding: These attacks take advantage of social and emotional constructs to either fool the user into clicking on a link or a file that is malicious, or in the case of ransomware, appeal to the user's sense of ownership of their data and the desire to gain access to files which are important to them and may not be available anywhere else. Someone recently asked what excites me about cybersecurity right now, and I said behavior analytics and how hackers use human behavior to manipulate their attacks, but also how security professionals can turn to behavior to better prevent attacks. In the Google Docs phish, the hackers not only turned to behavior to gain an edge, they also used the legitimate functionality within Google's infrastructure to provide a proper user login. They counted on the phishing recipients to simply react without thinking. And we should expect hackers to build on this type of attack vector, according to Simon Taylor, vice president of products at Glasswall, who told me in an email comment: Cyber criminals know that productivity suites like O365 and Google, as well as dynamic documents and other types of shared files are the lifeblood of today’s internet users. This includes consumers and employees of massive corporations, and oftentimes, they’re one and the same. While the threat has reportedly been mitigated by Google, this will not stop the ever-expanding theme of clever phishing tactics by malicious actors. What can you do to help your employees avoid phishing scams that are using the tools they use every day to conduct ordinary job duties? You know I’m going to say it’s time for security awareness training, specifically about this type of attack, and to always verify everything before clicking, especially if the request is out of the ordinary. In addition to that, Wenzler suggested that users should understand exactly how the software works: Under normal conditions, Google Docs won't ask a user to provide access to Google Docs. It already has it, essentially, as that's the nature of signing up for the service. Users who know that something called "Google Docs" won't ask for access like this attack did would know that something is amiss and could stop before providing that access. Always take a moment to understand what your web-based applications are supposed to do, and if you see something abnormal, err on the side of caution and do not proceed.

While Google’s Chrome OS and Android OS were both based on Linux, Fuchsia is not. Fuchsia OS is based on Google’s own “Magenta” microkernel, not to be confused with the Google AI music project of the same name. Fuchsia is all about speed, performance, and beauty. As mentioned by Ars Technica, Fuchsia works with Google’s Flutter SDK. Developers can find the Flutter SDK online right now, downloadable and usable right out the box. Flutter is not to be confused with another Google-owned group, also by the same name. Flutter’s claim to fame is the ability to develop for Android and iOS at the same time. ABOVE: The logo for Fuchsia on the left, above a couple of screens from the current build of the OS via Github. On the left is the first very rough version of the logo for Armadillo. I’m guessing this is just a placeholder, but if it isn’t, I applaud them for their courage. Included with Flutter is Dart, used here to do the building of both iOS and Android apps at the same time. Also included is Escher, a graphics renderer which uses the latest Vulkan SDK. As explained by Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney, Vulkan “provides a much faster connection between computing and graphics [than OpenGL used in the past], bringing technology that was originally developed for high-end game consoles like PlayStation and Xbox to your smartphone.” Just as Android runs one of several different kinds of deserts for its operating system generation, Fuchsia seems to be beginning with animals. Their first System UI name is Armadillo. To get a very basic idea of what Google is doing here, have a peek at this brief UI preview. The above video comes from developer Kyle Bradshaw of HotFixIt. This same link includes a guide on how to build one’s own copy of Armadillo straight from the public Git. Development of this OS is open to the public – everyone can see what’s going down as it happens. See the timeline below for the first couple of major events that’ve happened in the history of Google’s next OS. Development is well underway, and the team members on the development side of the equation are in place and working furiously toward a first release.

The technology giant teased a few more details on Monday about its upcoming Invoke speaker, created in partnership with audio company Harmon Kardon. The new speaker will debut in fall, Microsoft said in an announcement. The Invoke, which Microsoft (msft) first announced in December, will compete against Amazon's (amzn) Echo and Google's (goog) Home. Like those speakers, Invoke will let people use their voices to cue it to play music, read the news, and schedule reminders. Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter. Whereas Amazon’s Alexa and the Google Assistant digital voice recognition technologies enable Echo and Google Home to understand and react to human voices, Microsoft’s Cortana will power the Invoke. Big tech companies like Microsoft, Amazon, and Google have invested millions of dollars in their respective digital assistants, which they believe will be a major way that consumers will interact with computers—joining the standard keyboard, mouse, and touchscreen. Like the Echo, the Invoke resembles a small, sleek cylinder wrapped in a speaker. Neither Microsoft nor Harmon Kardon have said how much Invoke will cost, only that it will be released later this year. Echo sells for $180 while Home costs $130. Microsoft is pitching Invoke’s ability to be synced to its Skype online-phone service as a standout feature that will let users make calls to cell phones, landlines and other Skype-enabled devices, the company said in a blog post. Currently, Echo and Home are unable to make phone calls, but it’s likely they eventually will be able to with both Amazon and Google investing in their own voice messaging services like Amazon Chime and Google Hangouts for business customers, and Duo for consumers. Amazon’s Echo currently accounts for 70% of market share for the voice-controlled speaker market, followed by Google, which has 23.8%, according to research firm eMarketer. For more about technology and finance, watch: Besides Microsoft, Apple is also reportedly looking to build its own Internet-connected speaker. Apple senior vice president of worldwide marketing Phil Schiller recently hinted that the tech giant is thinking about incorporating its Siri digital assistant into a so-called smart home hub. About Echo, Schiller said, "if you don't have something nice to say, say nothing at all."

By Spencer Soper. Added by Agency Staff on 8 May 2017. Saved under News, Top Tags: Amazon, Apple, Brian Olsavsky, Google Tweet Amazon’s Echo Amazon.com will dominate Google in the voice-activated speaker market for the next few years due to the early breakout success of its Echo speaker, according to a forecast from research firm EMarketer. More than 35m Americans will speak to these Internet-connected speakers at least once a month this year, more than double the number in 2016, with tech-savvy millennials leading adoption, the EMarketer said in its first forecast of the burgeoning market. About 71% will use Echo devices, with the Google Home speaker trailing at 24%. Amazon will remain the dominant player for the next couple of years, even as Google narrows the gap, because it got such an early lead, EMarketer analyst Martin Utreras said. “Consumers are becoming increasingly comfortable with the technology, which is driving engagement,” he added. “As prices decrease and functionality increases, consumers are finding more reasons to increase adoption.” Indeed, a separate study released Monday shows Amazon’s US$50 Echo Dot, the cheapest version of the speaker, is helping boost adoption. The low-cost Dot, which Amazon introduced last year, is enticing consumers to try the technology. The model represents more than half of the 10,7m Echo devices sold since they were introduced, according to a report by Consumer Intelligence Research Partners. “The Echo Dot definitely helped drive Echo sales since the release of the second generation model in October 2016,” said Josh Lowitz, co-founder of the research firm. “Amazon priced it aggressively, offered big discounts during the holiday season, and offered promotions for purchasing multiple units to encourage gifting and multi-room home use.” Amazon unveiled the Echo, a cylindrical speaker that lets users stream music, dim lights and order pizza by voice, in 2014. The devices cost as much as $200 and have become a surprise hit for a company that had struggled with some of its other consumer hardware efforts. Google answered with its $115 Home device two years later. The gadgets target the house, when people might not have a smartphone handy and where portability isn’t an issue. Voice-based assistants, such as Apple’s Siri, are commonly accessed via smartphones. Amazon will “double down” on its investments in Echo devices and the underlying Alexa voice-activated system this year, chief financial officer Brian Olsavsky said on a recent earnings call. The company in April announced the latest Echo variation, called the Echo Look, a $200 hands-free camera designed for dressing rooms that takes photos and video on voice command so users can assess their outfits from every angle. The device also lets users submit photos of two outfits to get a recommendation on the best one. The company will soon unveil a new Echo that features a display.  — (c) 2017 Bloomberg LP Share this article Tweet Connect with TechCentral Follow TechCentral on Twitter Connect with TechCentral on Facebook Connect with TechCentral on Google+ Subscribe to our newsletter Articles by comments (7 days) 10Council slams Mophatlane exit at BCX 6Hlaudi to ‘impart study tips’ to kids 4Samsung replaces ADH for S8, S8+ 4Telkom creates dedicated e-sports company 4How Takealot will spend the Naspers millions Home About Advertise Newsletter Contact RSS ↑ TechCentral TechCentral Log in - (c) 2009 - 2015 NewsCentral Media

CDT May 08, 2017 (Photo: Google) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST LOS ANGELES - This week many folks found a suspicious e-mail in their inboxes. They were invited to look at a Google Doc with a link that was in fact a phishing exercise to tap into our digital identities. Luckily, Google got wind of it quickly, and disabled many of the features that were designed to steal information from you. Google Docs logo (Photo: Google)   The incident puts a spotlight on Google Docs and how we collaborate with the free, Internet-based word-processing tool. It could be better. Way better. And much of the onus is on us—we need to do a better job of explaining to our friends what the link is, and why it should be opened. Remember, look for the blue logo Sharing a document with others via Google Doc lets you select friends or colleagues, and they in turn get an e-mail saying that you have been invited to "edit the following document." Your recipients see the name of the document, and the familiar blue Google Docs logo. In the scam, they received something very similar. Hackers are savvy individuals, but they usually get one or two details wrong. In the bogus e-mail, which was sent to over 1 million Gmail users, including this reporter, we were asked to "Open in Docs," but an official e-mail request would have put in the Google Docs blue logo, and the actual name of the file we're being invited to view. But in both cases, the scam and the legitimate share, people get a form generated e-mail by a company that claims to be Google, under your name, and they have no idea whether it's real or not. Most folks don't even bother to put a message into their share e-mail. And that's something that's scary to receive.  Who knows what's really in there? What will happen to my computer if I open the link? (Hackers get access to your Google account, and all that Google knows about you and all the information you have stored.) Our suggestions: —Google also offers the option to click to obtain a "shareable link," at the top of the screen. Try that instead of generating the Google e-mail. Copy the link, compose an e-mail and send it to your friends with a personal note, telling them what's in the link and why it should be opened. After all, we're never going to open an e-mail with just a link again, right folks? As Forrester Research analyst Fatemeh Khatibloo told us this week, "always be skeptical." —Enable Google's two-factor authentication for your own protection against hackers. By having to sign in not once, but twice, the hackers will move on to lazier prey who use easy to crack passwords like 1-2-3-4-5-6 and "p-a-s-s-w-o-r-d." Google's two step process starts by signing in with your Google password. The second step is either a text message with a code, or if you prefer, you can also open up your Google app on your smartphone, and click "Yes," when prompted if you really want to sign in. Google also has an Authenticator app for signing in. © 2017 USATODAY.COM CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST JOIN THE CONVERSATION To find out more about Facebook commenting please read the Conversation Guidelines and FAQs Leave a Comment TRENDING VIDEOS Grandmother shot, killed in gang-related shooting Pearland student, 18, beats incumbent for school board seat Driver rescued as car dangles on parking garage ledge Customer held at gunpoint in local restaurant calls 911 Friends describe moment they saw Jordan Edwards fatal shooting Grandmother killed in drive-by shooting GCSO: 10 arrested on felony drug charges at Middlelands festival Pearland mayoral, city council, and school board election results Officials believe electrical shortage started elementary school fire Voters approve HISD's Proposition 1 for recapture payment More Stories Racist graffiti painted on church facility and car… May. 8, 2017, 10:28 p.m. Texas House passes pension reform bill May. 8, 2017, 4:59 p.m. Magnolia West football star killed in car crash May. 8, 2017, 10:21 p.m. About Us Contact Us Reporters Index Help Connect With Us FCC Online Public Inspection File • EEO Public File Report Home Weather Health Detail Closings & Delays Location Search Radars Conditions Hurricane Central More...

Google's "Fuchsia" operating system is taking shape with a new design Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/08 10:01am PDTMay 8, 2017 29 Plus 1 on G+ 243 Share on Facebook 78 Share on Twitter Total Shares350 Development Google News We first talked about Fuchsia, a new operating system being developed at Google, back in August (in fact, it was my first post here). At the time, there wasn't much to get excited about besides the potential - it only had a command-line interface. Now the project has a snazzy new, but clearly unfinished, interface. Summary of Fuchsia First, it's worth going over exactly what Fuchsia is, because it's been quite a while since we talked about it. As opposed to all of Google's other OSes, such as Android and Chrome OS, Fuchsia uses the company's new 'Magenta' kernel instead of Linux. According to the project's documentation, Magenta is designed for "modern phones and modern personal computers with fast processors, non-trivial amounts of ram with arbitrary peripherals doing open ended computation." Magenta's apps and the system interface are written with Google's Flutter SDK, which was initially designed to create cross-platform apps for iOS and Android. Flutter applications are written in Dart, the company's home-grown programming language. All of the system and apps are rendered by 'Escher,' which uses OpenGL or Vulkan to display everything. The 'Armadillo' interface So, on to the new stuff. Fuchsia's system UI has a new name - 'Armadillo.' Ars Technica was able to compile Armadillo into an Android APK, since it is written with the above-mentioned Flutter SDK. The interface doesn't really do anything besides looking pretty, but it does give us an idea of what the finished product could look like. The home screen is a vertical list, with a profile picture, the time, and a battery indicator in the center. Tapping the profile picture brings up something similar to Android's Quick Settings, with toggles for auto-rotate, do not disturb, Airplane Mode, and so on. Above the profile picture is the 'Story,' which the documentation describes as "a set of apps and/or modules that work together for the user to achieve a goal." Currently, this works similarly to Android's Recents screen. Users will also be able to combine stories into a 'Story Cluster.' This is what dragging a Story card into split-screen looks like. Dragging a Story card onto another one triggers a split-screen mode. The user can split an app 50/50 vertically or horizontally, drag in another app for a 33/33/33 split, or even have a tab bar appear for using all the open apps in full-screen. You can even have two apps split vertically next to two other split apps, seen below. This is far more flexible than Android's current multi-tasking functionality, but whether or not it will stay this way is uncertain. Below the profile picture is a panel resembling Google Now, with a placeholder search bar and suggestion cards. Armadillo's documentation says, "a suggestion is a representation of an action the user can take to augment an existing story or to start a new one. [The] suggestion contains enough information to create the visual representation of that concept." So maybe they will work more like an app launcher? It's hard to tell at this point. The Google Now panel, showing Fuchsia's keyboard. Keep in mind that all of this is subject to change, as the Armadillo interface (and the rest of Fuchsia OS) is still under heavy development. It's also hard to tell what Google's plans are for the operating system. Will it be neglected to Internet-of-Things devices and other basic hardware, or will it some day replace Android altogether? We'll have to wait and see.

Suicide_Note Because Google can. Corbin Davenport Ron from Ars Technica put it best: "Fuchsia really seems like a project that asks 'how would we design Android today, if we could start over?' It's a brand-new, Google-developed kernel running a brand-new, Google-developed SDK that uses a brand-new, Google-developed programming language and it's all geared to run Google's Material Design interface as quickly as possible. Google gets to dump Linux and the GPL, it can dump Java and the problems it caused with Oracle, and Google can basically insulate itself from all of Android's upstream projects and bring all the development in-house. Doing such a thing on the scale of Android today would be a massive project." makapav Would it still be open source? Also, what would happen to all the existing APKs? Corbin Davenport Fuchisa is completely open source right now. As for running Android apps, maybe Google will add some kind of stop-gap compatibility layer for running Android apps, like Chrome OS has. destinyhud read the article Suicide_Note Perhaps instead of replacing Android, this will *become* Android, as in Android P or Q? Or be the merger of Android/Chrome? m477 I could see that as Android 10. Definitely too early for P. morteum I wonder if the reason it is called "Armadillo" is because they're starting from A again, but this time they're using animals instead of desserts. Christopher Bement I think it's a smart plan, based on the guess that there's more animals to pick from in the world than tasty desserts. teolinux Ubuntu docet Paul "Tasty treats," not necessarily desserts. That said, armadillos could be a tasty treat. I won't judge. MJ I have heard desserts and candy used before which are wrong but "tasty treats" is a new one for me. To be more accurate, Android names are actually all confectionery foods. A "tasty treat" could be a slice of pizza (aka Android S). LOL Randy Gindy Armadillo is the name of the UI not the OS build itself. Matt74UK Smooth on the inside, crunchy on the outside. Armadillo ! (a few UK people of a certain age may get that). John Doe Idk this is a whole new OS with a new kernel, I doubt this will be done with an OTA update for Android. Mantas Pakėnas Even nowadays, some of Android's new functionality cannot be done via OTA updates (like dual system partitions, forced encryption I believe, etc). To make a completely hard cut sometime when this is ready, and if it's meant to replace Android, is not completely unimaginable. As is updating via OTA. If apple was able to change their file system via OTA, I don't see why changing most of the parts would not be possible. However, nobody aside from Google would do it, almost guaranteed :) Suicide_Note It could likely be done for Pixel devices, and possibly for future devices released after this new version of the OS rolls out. Adrian Meredith quite possibly, after all there no reason it couldn't also run android apps jonathan What they need to do is make this googles very own os for their pixel line and leave android for the oems Suicide_Note Not a chance. To much name recognition with Android for Google to drop it in favor of something else specific to the Pixel lineup. Dallas King Android Z confirmed! Suicide_Note More like Android A for Armadillo. m477 APK plz (no, really, I want a compiled apk the demo) Maxwell “Max” Weinbach https://github.com/fuchsia-mirror/sysui MJ Your link wasn't what the OP asked for... Maxwell “Max” Weinbach the only way to get the APK is to compile it yourself, so I linked to the Github page to a place to download the files to compile. The closest they will get. MJ Than you should have replied there is no known APK or not at all. Maxwell “Max” Weinbach It does not matter that much. I am building the APK right now. Once it is done I will post it. Here is the link on how to compile it. http://www.hotfixit.net/single-post/2017/05/03/How-to-build-Armadillo MJ Don't waste your time... They updated that article with an download of the APK. Maxwell “Max” Weinbach thanks. they just did that. I still compiled it myself though. I will try to get more out of it while I have the Sysui downloaded. Michel R. https://www.androidfilehost.com/?w=files&flid=178684 there you go MJ http://www.hotfixit.net/single-post/2017/05/03/How-to-build-Armadillo Latex beats nudity More of Proprietary code ? No thank you, we already had enough with this Pixel crud. I hope this OS dies quicker or become a chromebook OS. m477 It's open source. Latex beats nudity It's OSS but just like Android It'll be more heavily dependent on the google APIs to make it work. Look at the Pixel SysUI, Just being OSS doesn't make it open source... It's Google's OS not a Linux Based one. If this is going to replace Android It's doomsday on multiple levels. destinyhud billions of people dont care if its running linux kernel or not. maybe very few like u might. do iphone users care why kernel it runs. none of them care. u r just noise tbh Latex beats nudity Billions of people don't code. You are being a kool-aid joke tbh. destinyhud exaclt only few code and even on that few many dont care if it runs linux or not. look at iphone there are more dev there and yet they dont care for kernel. u r delusional in ur own world m477 Android it's already been on a Google-dependent road for years. I don't think this is going to change either way. An Angry Chihuahua https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/magenta/+/master/docs/getting_started.md heres the source code. do some research my dude WitnessG Imagining this running on a Google made processor is exciting. Badouken If this was the OS for the Pixel 2 alongside a Google made processor I think id cry! WitnessG Yeah I don't see this coming out for at least another 2-3 years. Badouken Indeed, but we can dream! ha Suicide_Note Maybe the Pixel 3 or 4 will see the dream become reality. Suicide_Note I'm betting this is what we'll see in a couple years time. As another commenter stated, starting with Armadillo could be Google's way of starting from the beginning (letter A codename), since there's more animal babes to use for each letter than there are dessert names to use. Timothy Vreeland You are getting the furries excited. Nomaan Armadillo should be compared to holo/material and not to dessert names. nachofrand What makes you think Google would be good at making SoCs? They're a software company and don't have the hardware expertise for hardcore ASIC development like that. Granted they can hire people, but in the end, does it matter? They're going to use ARM either way. UnlikeABoss Google fanboyism. The same reason he's excited over a brand new OS. He knows absolutely nothing about it, short of the fact that it will create more fragmentation not only in the OS space, but also the kernel space. So all we know are negative things so far. This is what we call exciting now is it? Why? Just because Google is doing it? If Microsoft made this exact same announcement, would we all be excited? Oh dear. Zsolt V No, because essentially everybody loathes Microsoft. Almost nobody's life would be worse if Microsoft vanished. marcusmarcus2 Don't they design and build their own servers to use for all their websites? Seems like those hardware work well for them. Sergii Pylypenko It's one thing to assemble the server using off-the-shelf components, or even to order a custom motherboard. It's a very different thing to design and manufacture your own chips. marcusmarcus2 I'm not saying it is the same, just that they are not only software experts. Them designing and building the servers show they do have hardware expertise that could assist them in doing the same to chips. Zsolt V Except Google's servers are not assembled from off the shelf components. Haven't been for a few years now. Roy What about TPU? Adrian Vovk Samsung Exynos devices are faster than Snapdragon, iPhones seem underpowered but are extremely snappy, etc. The point is that making both the software and hardware leads to a very fast ecosystem. Also, Google are making the TPU for neural networks nachofrand Yes, as expected. Exynos is faster than Snapdragon on the Galaxy phones, but put an Exynos in another phone...oh wait, you can't. That's the whole entire point. Snapdragon SoCs are general purpose SoCs and can be used for a multitude of phones so they're not custom tuned to every phone individually. Exynos have very specific power rails and the chip is made specifically for that phone. The thing is, sure this is better, but it's marginal and hardly worth talking about. They both use the same ARM architecture so performance gains are pretty negligible. Besides that, this is how Samsung makes money....off of device sales. Google doesn't make money that way. That isn't their business model so at this point it doesn't make sense for them to build their own SoCs when they could just work closer with hardware companies. They make their own TPUs because it aligns with their business model. Adrian Vovk The instruction set doesn't really matter? I can have a 6700k and a 6500k and the 6700k will perform much better even though they are both amd64. With what Google is doing with the Pixels (still as snappy as day one here) I'm pretty sure they can optimize it further than Samsung does. They have made it run smoother in some cases on a chip that they didn't manufacture. If they made their own chip it would allow them many freedoms that they otherwise don't have = easier design of the device. I brought up the TPUs because that is experience in chip manufacturing Jason What makes you say iPhones are under powered ? Apples chips are some of the fastest around and are extremely powerful. Adrian Vovk Specs wise. They have much worse specs on paper and it would lead to a slower experience, except Apple can optimize it because they make both the chip and the OS Stephen Sharp They could use Risc-V and have to pay to license absolutely nothing, while being able to make processors purpose built for their OS Randy Gindy That would be an interesting move. Stephen Sharp Indeed, I really want Risc-V to succeed as an open ISA nachofrand They could. But in my opinion, it's unlikely. Google isn't trying to compete with Samsung and Apple in device sales and that isn't their business model. People using their services so they can show ads is their business model. It doesn't make sense for Google to make their own SoC when others are already doing a good job. Plus, if they went to RISC-V then what? What about the modem? They have to buy a standalone modem from Qualcomm or Intel. Now you have to hire system integration and test engineers to make sure the modem is working with your SoC. Oh and then you need a whole firmware team to control the modem. At that point, buy a full blown SoC with the modem on chip. Stephen Sharp Eh you lost me at "Pixel phone" and all the other hardware they sell. Google also is a Platinum member of the Risc-V foundation, and if there is a direction they are going, more control or less control, I would guess it's "more". But that's just a guess nachofrand Hardware isn't even close to the same thing as asic development. IC design is a different world. Granted they do some custom hardware, but SoCs are a much much larger feat. It's still a possibility they do so, but it doesn't make sense with their current business model imo. Captain On! 1 - Google has stated that they're going to make their own silicon for the Pixels in time. 2 - Google actually owns/operates the world's most powerful quantum computer. They know how to make chips. Randy Gindy That quantum computer was built by DWave though Angel I read (somewhere don’t remember) that they have three different quantum computers systems. One from DWave and two home-produced. From those two, one was made by engineers and not that disimilar from DWave in its operations. The other was made by physicists and uses a different approach. nachofrand 1. I could be wrong, but I've only read that they plan on working closer with chip manufacturers. 2. Google didn't make that computer. Even if they did, quantum is so different those skills don't even translate. Romario Maxwell Google made their own custom ASIC called the Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) for their AI/Machine Learning needs on their cloud platform. See https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2016/05/Google-supercharges-machine-learning-tasks-with-custom-chip.html and https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2017/04/quantifying-the-performance-of-the-TPU-our-first-machine-learning-chip.html nachofrand Sure, although a TPU is just an accelerator. Think of it as the hexagon DSP inside of the Snapdragon SoC. That's like 1/10 of the entire chip. SoC design is much larger. Timothy Vreeland How many examples of hardware design do people have to point out before you stop? Sure the hardware they worked on previously isn't exactly the same... But before they started the hardware they are currently working on, they worked on previous hardware that wasn't the same as what they are doing now. They have shown they are competent in designing many kinds of hardware. Or do you suggest a company can only build one kind of hardware and nothing else for all eternity? How did Samsung make it's current in-house chips? Did they go to ARM college? Have they been making ARM chips since the dawn of time? No. They put together some teams and got to work, so stop blabbing and being negative. sweenish Their AI that finally beat the world's top Go players was running on custom Google chips. It's not like they don't know how. Pixelexel Imagine a Google Pixel with a Google made processor, with Fuschia, with Project Fi with Google WiFi powered by Google fiber. If I'd have this, my life would be complete. Iamsecond Ha, no. A Google processor? Supported for 18 months, then replaced with a new processor that performs half as well (but has stickers.) Does not fully process Android code, because at Google one hand doesn't even know the other hand is there, let alone talk to it. Has 20 cores (only 2 enabled outside US for 'reasons.') Has a dedicated co-processor to enable ads in every app, even those that previously didn't have them. Jason Google can't even get a phone out the door without issues and you want them to make the chips too...lol. I'll pass. UnlikeABoss "In house kernel instead of Linux". Yeah, hopefully this dies in a thousand pits of fire. "Hey Linux guys, you know how you've helped us make billions over the years with a free open source kernel? Well, we were just using you to get the "nerd" userbase. Now we own the market thanks to you guys promoting its use of Linux, we will gradually phase you out." .... m477 I hope not. Linux is not really a kernel made with smartphone in minds. I don't care for being a fan of a kernel over another. UnlikeABoss Yeah. I'd much rather use a brand new untested kernel (and all the teething issues that will come with it) in my smartphone than a mature, stable one that's hacked on by hundreds and thousands of people every month. I mean, it's just a smartphone, we don't need it to be a secure environment, right? Let's just make a nice obscure kernel that no one else will use, and just say "but but it's open source!!! love us because we are Google kk". ... ihsan ışık I'm sorry but it just looks like you are a huge Linux fan and are just against change to me. UnlikeABoss Looks can be deceiving. If you're going to fling around the Linux fanboy term, i'll fling around the Google fanboy term, and that will surely be a nice constructive argument that we will both want to continue. m477 So, in 10 years we should still be using an unoptimised kernel like Linux, because anything newer is, well, newer? UnlikeABoss Yeah, because Linux hasn't changed at all in 10 years... m477 Yes, it changed a lot, and it still has many of the same problems, which are intrinsically bound to its structure. It's not a kernel well suited for mobile devices. UnlikeABoss You think the solution is to throw it out the window and start from scratch? I disagree. I'd much rather continue improving the Linux kernel, simply because of all the eyes it will always have on its code. jonathan Play nice ladies lol m477 With this mentality we wouldn't have Linux at all. Why start anything, while we can continue this other thing which purpose was completely different? A mircokenel is more well suited than a monolitic kernel to a mobile devices, both in terms of performance and security. No matter how much you improve Linux, it will never be a microkernel. UnlikeABoss Smartphones don't need a micro kernel in 2017. You could make that argument 7 years ago. Linux can be compiled with the required drivers just like it always could. m477 I made that argument 7 years ago. They always needed something different from Linux. The fact that specific, even proprietary drivers have to be integrated in the kernel (since Android lacks an abstraction layer) is on of the problems of the interaction Android-Linux. destinyhud why havent the nerds made linux on pc's a bigger market share if they were the one who made android a global leader UnlikeABoss No nerd is promoting Linux on the desktop. All social media used to be full of people promoting Android over iOS, these days there's no need to. destinyhud why havent they promoted desktop?? just wondering why they did for android but not for desktop.. linux on desktop was an underdog for decades. android was not popular because of kernal. android became popular because it was opensource and was the only viable competition to ios. people dont care what kernel it runs. UnlikeABoss No nerd worth their salt would promote an environment that would be a downgrade from Windows. Android was not a downgrade from iOS at any point in time, it had a very equal playing field. There's a difference between promoting a good solid FOSS kernel where possible, and promoting an agenda. m477 Android was not a downgrade from iOS at any point in time By this, I get that you never used Android and iOS side by side in 2009-10. UnlikeABoss You clearly value different things. The hackability alone made it an upgrade through its lifetime. m477 The same can be said for GNU/Linux on desktop. UnlikeABoss No it can't, because hackability =/= app availability. i.e. The hackability on Linux desktop doesn't make it win over it's lack of apps, where that isn't an issue on Android. m477 App availability was horrible in the early days, compared to iOS. Even Symbian had more apps. UnlikeABoss That was fine since the early days didn't consist of using your smartphone for very much, due to under powered hardware. Techies didn't go around saying "use iOS because we can all take selfies and stick filters on it". m477 iOS devices didn't have front cameras until mid 2010. The system was better, faster, smoother, the interface was coesive, there were many more apps, and the jailbreak community, to address the techie audience you like to go on about so much, was very, very good. There were tweaks and modifications that even the wildest Android custom ROM didn't have at the time. Android was objectively a downgrade, as much as Linux was on desktop. UnlikeABoss Calling jailbraik an advantage over a FOSS OS is pretty hilarious. iOS wasn't popular because it was better, it was popular because of the amount of people getting their advice from paid employees in store. "Buy iOS so we get a commission". m477 iPhone was more popular for various reasons: marketing, having 2 years of advantage, and, yes, more marketing. But it was also better than Android, as an OS. What benefit did Android bring, with it being opensource, compared to iOS, even to a "techie"? The dev community was laughable in the early days. Why GNU/Linux on desktop was not promoted by "techies" (which is false) and Android was, even if their shortcomings were identical? destinyhud u live in a dream world. even most dev dont care about kernel. what they care about the dev platform. I am a dev and i dont care for the kernel UnlikeABoss If you're talking from the perspective of an app developer then ofcourse you don't care about the kernel, you care about which platform will make you the most money... destinyhud exactly. no one care what kernel it runs.. all dev care is what platform make money. so who is this nerd who care about kernel if most dont care about the kernel.. yeah very very few.. infact rare like u UnlikeABoss Techie == Technology Enthusiast. You can sit here and tell me that you would use the best dev environment all you want but the truth is if the iOS dev environment was awful you'd still suck it up and use it to make your money. I'm not sure how you can class yourself as an enthusiast at that point. destinyhud ever wonder why no one is up voting u and upvoting many of my comments? because what u say is BS. its that simple. I am up for ditching outdated linux if the new kernal is modern and build for modern devices. most dont care for this very few techies.. i hope this becomes true and linux kernel die.. UnlikeABoss "Ever wonder why Google fanboys upvote pro Google content and not anti-Google content?" No, no I don't wonder that. How dare someone critique a pointless change by Google, causing unnecessary fragmentation. Burn them! destinyhud u must be new here.. look at anti google comments here when they make stupid changes but if they make welcome changes people tend to agree UnlikeABoss No, I've been here a long time and made many anti-Google comments as well as pro-Google. No one in the right mind would cheer on kernel fragmentation other than those that think Google can do no wrong. destinyhud open up ur comments history and let me see if u made pro google comments. i have a feeling u r a troll UnlikeABoss Yeah, this discussion is going no where. You are not the authority here and the idea that you want to browse my history to make sure I fall in line is creepy as hell. Bye. destinyhud lol i see u dont want to open ur comments history. obvious troll m477 outdated linux i hope this becomes true and linux kernel die Woah, wait a second here. Linux is not outdated, and its death would be terrible for everyone. It's just that it's not the most apt kernel for a mobile device. destinyhud maybe not outdated but not the right fit for mobile devices. destinyhud android sucked when compared to ios.. it was a downgrade compared to ios. why did dev promote android and not desktop linux? u reasoning dont even make sense. UnlikeABoss No, it wasn't a downgrade. destinyhud yes, it was back in android initial release. iOS was better and much more polished at that time. but things changed now. UnlikeABoss "Polished" is not a factor that is used to judge a better OS. There are Linux environments that are much more polished than Windows 10, but that doesn't make desktop Linux better. destinyhud it was both polished and runs better than android at that time. polished was not the only one. it was also polished. android only got better later.. i have used android at that time and it sucked big time. UnlikeABoss You are using today's standards to judge it. If you do that, they both sucked. It worked perfectly fine for the basic things people were using it for at the time. destinyhud they both sucked at that time but android sucked more than iOS at that time. SVem26 I like to think I am in the nerd userbase and I don't care what kernel is used.. can you help me understand why it matters? UnlikeABoss Do you want a brand new obscure kernel in thing that holds most of your sensitive details? TipTop I don't want something that dates back to 90s, is full of zero-days and horrible code contributed by nobodies. UnlikeABoss The idea that it is full of zero days is hilarious. You do realize that the majority of Linux exploits are local, right? Unlike Windows. Yes there is obviously code from the 90s, but very, very little of it. Not to mention that age is not a factor in deciding bad code. The idea that old code is bad code shows your inexperience. By that standard, should we dismiss Chrome because of all the exploits being found in code that was written when it first started? Are we going to create brand new software every few years to purge "old code"? Do you have any idea whatsoever how much Linux has actually changed? Do you have any idea how much of this change is because it's considered a "universal" kernel everyone can use and is focusing on? Do you really think splitting the community over onto another kernel will increase security for either of those kernels? There's a little something called code maturity. There's a reason Microsoft has way less exploits in its kernel today than 10 years ago. They didn't write a new kernel from scratch. Sir_Brizz All OSes are full of vulnerabilities and horrible code written by nobodies. If that is your requirement then you must have gone full luddite by now. ihsan ışık Are you implying that Android got popular because of "nerds" who heard it uses the Linux kernel? UnlikeABoss If you are old enough to know the early days of android you'll know that having every single nerd on the internet promoting Android over iOS most certainly helped get the ball rolling. Once it was pushed, it snowballed into what it is today. m477 Sure. It was the nerds on the internet, not the manufacturers with ads everywhere. Most people still don't know their Galaxy runs Android. UnlikeABoss The giant billboards came YEARS afterwards, cmon. m477 Yes, and that's why Android was so unpopular in the early days. UnlikeABoss What? It was massively popular among all techies for being the open source iOS alternative. m477 You are overestimating the "techies" crowd. Even BlackBerryOS was more popular at the time. Only after the Galaxy S it started to grow, and became popular among normal people. UnlikeABoss Not really. We are talking over a decade ago now, there were far less people on the internet and it was far easier for techies to promote products because everyone was asking their "techie" friend what is best. But these days everyone is an "expert" so that's not as much of a thing. m477 Again, you overestimate how many techies there actually were. Your personal experience is anecdotal. Market shares and sell data are objective. Also, over a decade ago Android was still a camera os, and it wasn't public. UnlikeABoss No, I do not. The further back in time you go, the higher the proportion of techies there were using the internet versus others. People were only just starting to look at buying a smartphone, and asking techies what they should buy. m477 Yes, the concentration on the internet of "techies" on the internet was greater. And? What normal user at the time went to the internet, looked at reviews and said "Oh, look! The HTC magic has Linux! This random guy says its good, so I'm gonna buy it!"? You really think that a bunch of "techies">marketing? A guy saying that his toy-looking HTC G1 is better than the iPhone is more effective than billboards and tv ads? Come on, even Windows Mobile was more popular. It took Samsung's aggressive marketing to make Android popular. UnlikeABoss Windows Mobile and BlackBerry were more popular in the enterprise, that's it. The entire discussion is home users. Also I think there's been some confusion. I wasn't implying that techies on the internet were promoting Android on the internet like a marketing department. I was implying that the internet was very much a "social media" platform for techies to communicate where the majority of them would use Android and mocked the use of iOS. The actual "marketing" happened offline when a normal user would ask their "techie" friend for first time buying advice. It is nothing like that today, and the internet is nothing like the techie community it once was. m477 So, what you're saying is that the internet was a circlejerk of Android users. Ok, and? It didn't affected normal users the slightest, iOS was still more popular until Samsung took Android more seriously. The techie friend thing its only your anecdotal experience, it bears no influence on the market, in the grand scheme of things. I'd even argue that Google's very light marketing did much, much more. Also, the mindless techies that recommended half backed devices instead of better alternatives because "Uh, Linux!!" did more harm than good, both to the users and to Android. UnlikeABoss If you read my OP you'll see my original point was that Google has rode the "Android circlejerk" to popularity, and you can debate how much popularity that added as much as you want. The fact remains, it got the ball rolling. Samsung didn't pick it up "just because", it saw that a lot of people were pushing it. There were several OS at the time it could have used, including sticking to its own. Why bother with Android? Maybe because it wanted to see how much market it could take by appealing to techies? However, if you stand back and look at it, how is this any different from "embrace, extend, extinguish"? Google used that "free marketing" and has now decided to use it's massive popularity to push a different product. (Which has failed in the past and will hopefully fail again). Why hate Microsoft for doing that in the past, but we praise Google for doing it? Why are we excited for something we know nothing about that is creating fragmentation? m477 Samsung had used several OSes, it had Windows Mobile and Phone devices, Symbian devices, and proprietary devices, even Palm OS devices IIRC. They used them all. Android had was the easiest to personalise for them, and create a copy of the best selling product, which was the iPhone, and there was an app market, so they tried to release and market their flagship with it, and market it as broadly as Apple. The first Galaxy (the "non S") was was vastly ignored, because it was as little marketed as all their other devices. The techies crowd was insignificant. The free marketing is just as much as Windows 10 gets for incorporating Ubuntu's bash terminal. What you saw is not really important. I saw lots and lots of Windows Phones in 2010 and 11. Many more than Android devices. Every one I knew had one, and if I had to say which OS was the most popular only based on my personal experience, in my smallish city, I'd obviously would say Windows Phone. Why are you so attached to Linux, excluding all possibilities of giving a possibly better solution a try? The community will just fork the AOSP and continue the development of the Linux branch. UnlikeABoss Cmon, we both know Android was not easier for them to customize than simply using their own OS. No one was recommending it, techie or not, no matter how much they marketed. It's only now they are popular they are trying to slip in their own OS, and still failing. I am not attached to Linux despite people using it as an easy scapegoat to dismiss a discussion critiquing almighty Google. We currently have a situation where most kernel developers focus entirely on Linux, making it virtually the universal kernel. Why are we creating pointless fragmentation there? Why divide that community? Do we honestly believe that a divided community can produce a better kernel, or do we love it because Google is doing it? Would we love it if Microsoft did this? m477 The proprietary OS they used at the time was a Java based thing with a flash interface. Hardly able to compete against iOS. It was easier for them to use the "next Symbian" that they could customise as they wanted, and that also had an app market. If they made, say, Bada, before Android become established and popular, and marketed it as much as they did with their Galaxy S, the market would be very different today. The normal user doesn't care what OS their shiny phone runs, as long as there's facebook. I am a GNU/Linux user since the first half of the 2000s, and I've always critiqued Google for using Linux as a kernel on phones. Linux might be the universal kernel, but smartphones need a more streamlined solution. I don't care if it's Google, the MIT, or Richard Stallman in person to do it. I liked WP8 architecture. Fragmentation is not pointless if it brings benefits to the user. TipTop Nobody cares about your FSF agenda. John Q I think the chief reason Google is not using Linux is that they want a real-time OS (RTOS). Linux is at best a "soft" RTOS, possessing a real-time scheduler but this is still not nearly as real-time as an actual RTOS should be. It would take a very large effort to do that for Linux so it makes sense that Google would want to make their own kernel that they can have full control over. UnlikeABoss Let's ignore the fact that Linux is used in real time car systems for a moment. Could you elaborate on why you think Google would want/need a RTOS on their smartphones? M6 The kernel they're using, 'magenta', is opened source. So who cares if they're using linux or not? Does everyone have to use linux? UnlikeABoss No it doesn't have to be Linux. But who else will use Magenta? Probably no one. So why are we fragmenting the kernel space further? Why would you choose an immature kernel for something as valuable (your data) as your smartphone. Would you trust that? I would much rather developers continue focusing on a single kernel. WesleySmalls But wouldn't Magenta be this single kernel? UnlikeABoss If everyone decided to ditch Linux and focus purely on Magenta as the universal kernel, yes. Will that happen? WesleySmalls Could be, just not overnight. The market was already fairly well developed when Linux arrived in 1991, yet it still managed to become a very, if not the most, important player in the market. It's certainly possible, it will just require proper investment(and neglect of their alternate platforms) and patience to make it work M6 That's some straight up communist shit right there. Let's just work on one thing, because we only need one thing, everything else is redundant! Let's not allow other people to do the same thing in a different way, because competition totally doesn't spur innovation at all. WORPspeed So Andromeda definitely dead or still happening? sleepinlight Pretty sure this IS Andromeda, or at least a part of it. Andromeda was never an official name for anything, it was just the internal project name for some sort of new and/or merged OS. WORPspeed I thought Andromeda specifically referred to merging Android and Chrome OS. So is that specific merger dead or on life-support? John Q Nah, the Android/Chrome merger was just speculation from what Andromeda seemed to be. There was never any concrete evidence to imply that Andromeda was a merger. WORPspeed To quote Androidpolice : "So please, when you see Fuchsia mentioned, or speculation that it "is" Andromeda, know that it is just that: speculation. Last we heard from sources we consider extremely reliable, Android was the basis of Andromeda, and Andromeda would see its commercial debut on a new Pixel laptop later this year. It is possible Google has changed plans around Andromeda, that the initiative itself may have even been scrapped. Though, we have no reason to think so - it's more that we don't know, and haven't heard anything about Andromeda in quite some time." http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/02/15/speculation-around-googles-fuchsia-os-and-andromeda-is-creating-confusion-and-misinformation/ WORPspeed http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/02/15/speculation-around-googles-fuchsia-os-and-andromeda-is-creating-confusion-and-misinformation/ That makes them seem very separate Srujan https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/e7fda716dfcfdca76e200e51a9c9144c72e183c7e76d36b910c20ee0931aee79.gif destinyhud if this replaces android rather than having 2 separate codebase, I am all up for it. splitting the android community is dangerous senor_heisenberg Well if this does end up being what replaces Android or what Android evolves into, I just hope my apps and whatnot are compatible. Ain't got the time or money to be investing into another ecosystem. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman That's a tricky, double-edged sword. I can't fathom they would not support the old apps, or at least the vast majority of them, for exactly that reason. But in doing so it will likely be held back at least slightly from what it can/should be. Backward-compatibility tends to hold everything back. What I'd wager is we won't see this until hardware's powerful enough to make emulating the old system in a VM relatively cheap and easy, with back-end Play Store penalties to developers who don't shift to the new app models, and then slow phase-outs in stages of the older functionality and support until the new OS is running exclusively its own setup. senor_heisenberg That sounds good. Randy Gindy I think Google porting the Android Run-time to Chrome OS was to see if they could do it. morteum This is old news, I'm waiting for Fuchsia 2.0 Barracuda. /s marcusmarcus2 What if they aren't going by Animal names in general but by mammal names. I'd skip the Fuchsia 2.0 Bandicoot. It will probably be "Crash" prone. Alfonso Surroca Three operating systems is not nearly enough. We need at least two more announced at I/O.

Suicide_Note There is no update problem. Nexus/Pixels run the latest and greatest. OEMs who mess with the OS give their customers severely delayed updates. pfmiller Nexus and Pixels run the latest and greatest for two years. Nobody would accept this OS update situation if it was on a desktop OS. MJ Thank God it's phones we are talking about and not a desktop PC. marcusmarcus2 That is exactly why Windows XP lasted only a couple years before all computers updated to Windows 7... Seriously though. I'm fine with only getting Android version upgrades phones for 2 years. But they really need to extend out security updates beyond 3 years. Suicide_Note This isn't a desktop OS, not to mention people tend to change phones much more often than their desktops. pfmiller Sure it's not a desktop OS, but no sense pretending that what we have leaves nothing to be desired. And sure people change their phones more often that their desktops, but there's absolutely no reason to change every 2 years. Doby Gillis Which is a problem, Einstein. Suicide_Note Not if you're a Nexus/Pixel owner, Dilbert. Randy Gindy I would generally say there is. Android phones are not supported for nearly as long as an iPhone. The reason being that the chip set manufacturers do not release new drivers. Shelly-Man Vol 2 It's looks pretty neat for a development stage. Rami Well Android has to reach Z someday. In the case, Hello Fuchsia! marcusmarcus2 Those split-screens will be really useful for running of of Google's different messaging apps. Hopefully OS's aren't the new messaging apps of Google.

You can install it just as any other apk WesleySmalls "Will it be neglected to Internet-of-Things devices and other basic hardware, or will it some day replace Android altogether?" Neither, this is just a side project many developers use to test and work out the feasability of a variety of things. Android is a very well developed environment, and replacing it whole is simply a no-go. Things will just gradually evolve, as they have already done with Dalvik being replaced by ART, for example. Sir_Brizz I don't think you're wrong, but it would be in Google's best interest to start building a non-JVM runtime that apps can run inside with a native language that Google has 100% full control over like Go or Dart. Тарас Мукин 1. This is definetelly Chat UI! It came from Telegram bots and whatsoever, and it is so smart of Google to be developing it now. Feels like it's going to be next big UI-change after Apple came up with apps divided into screens. 2. "Magenta is designed for ... non-trivial amounts of ram" This is going to be optimised sooo bad.

Nicolas Bahamondes Fuchsia Police... Alvin My money is on this turning into a really useful and innovative messaging app. Oh, with stickers. Superman Not happening, just like module phone. Lol Cyber Jethro I personally think this is for embedded systems like shopping kiosks or other customer service applications. Zach Mauch "Will it be neglected to Internet-of-Things devices and other basic hardware" Did you mean "relegated", not "neglected"? PVL_93_RU Those "stories" on the "home screen" look like they'd fit perfectly for a kiosk-type display, where you have a lot of space to work with JG Fuchsia is a purple-y pink color. T-Mobile's color is Magenta, a slightly different purple-y pink color T-Mobile is rumored to be looking into launching their own phone... Coincidence??? Almost certainly, without a doubt yes... But consider... T-Mobile also launched the first Android phone... yoloswag Inspired by the messaging team, Google wants to start working on a 2nd operating system. JG Magenta is designed for "modern phones and modern personal computers with fast processors, non-trivial amounts of ram with arbitrary peripherals doing open ended computation." Modern personal computers huh? I've been interested in Google packing ChromeOS into a LiveCD type set up we could test/install on our own computers... (*Yes, I know of Chromium, haven't tried it yet... But I would prefer it coming direct from Google, faster updates and all that). It could be interesting to try out another of Google's OSs without having to fork over several hundred for new hardware... The only problem would be drivers to support the various hardware. If not modified too much, ChromeOS could possibly use the original Gentoo Linux drivers. But with Fuchsia using its own unique kernel... That might throw things off a bit... I know a few less tech-savey individuals who would probably be more comfortable if the same OS powered their phone, tablet and desktop (should Google opt to replace Android with Fuchsia). Especially if it could run both Android apps and Chrome extensions natively. Zxyon Rhysivz This could be the beginning of distros for Android. *Imagines Ubuntu Android* Peter World Citizen This will run in parallel with Android.

Server-side tests have broken Google Now and the Play Store for some users Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/06 5:53pm PDTMay 6, 2017 42 Plus 1 on G+ 97 Share on Facebook 80 Share on Twitter Total Shares219 Applications Google News Google regularly conducts server-side tests - showing new features and UI changes to only a handful of users at a time. Unfortunately, sometimes these have adverse affects on users. In this case, Google has broken the Play Store and Google Now for some users, as a result of two independent server-side tests. The Play Store test, according to one report on the Google Play Help Forum, removes everything from the app's home page. Apps can still be searched for and installed, and updating applications works fine, but the front page is completely blank. There does not appear to be any fix for this right now - if you have it, you're stuck with it until Google figures it out. Another test completely breaks Google Now cards, with the main Now screen showing a generic error message. Luckily, there is a way to fix this one. Simply open your Settings app, go to the Application Manager, find the Google app, tap 'Manage Storage,' and finally press 'Clear Google Search Data.' Between this, the recent Google Drive for Windows mishap, and the dogfood update that was pushed to normal users, I think Google is forgetting that most people don't want to be beta (or alpha) testers.

Lildebbie My Google cards stopped working earlier today luckily I figured out clearing the app data on my own. Smh. Averix I had to leave the Google Play Services beta because several apps were crashing with a null pointer error. It stems from a native ad call in Google Play Services.

I ended up deleting my account associated with the play store, rebooting, and adding my account again. After that, my play store came back. AQ somewhat related: I wish I could disable the google app on my tablet, it always wants to run & can't be force stopped :( Rafy286 Thanks for reporting this AP, once again I thought it was my phone acting up due to the beta Google app. What a mess Google become in the last few weeks. TedPhillips wish you could opt into beta for certain devices... just pulled the trigger on the google app beta so i could poke around on certain form factors, don't really need/want it on my daily driver mobile. JD You can but control is an illusion with Google Carson Saldanha The one time I'm glad I never get server-side tests first. Lord Argyris "I think Google is forgetting that most people don't want to be beta (or alpha) testers." These days I'm having trouble remembering the time when Google hadn't forgotten this. JD Google's thinking is youre using our stuff on Android you're a willing beta tester otherwise you'd use our services on iOS. Sukigu Meanwhile, those of us who do sign up for alpha and beta tests for Google apps more often than not don't see any actual differences because they didn't get lucky on the A/B lottery. Vlado Repeated restart with switch on 4G network helped me to fix issue with failed to load Google Now cards (on Friday evening). AintaDamnThingFunny It's definitely broke for me M Gordon It broke for me on Friday for a couple hours (Google now) Dean Selinger I had the Google Now error and found my way, with help from a google search, to the above solution. Earlier I briefly had a new recent searches tab in Google Now. I liked the idea and the implementation was easy enough to navigate. Next time I opened Now it was gone. I got the Failed to load cards error sometime afterwards​. Kaan Sentürk Google Now on Android Wear 2.0 is also broken. It doesn't refresh my feed anymore and many cards aren't displaying. Google should finally fix this Roh_Mish Ugh! Google and it's server side tests. Just this week I got the white YouTube UI. Then I got the white UI + Bottom bar. Then I got a different top bar. Then all of them went away, including the pull up suggestion in landscape. And now youtube crashes after every few minutes. Clearing data didn't help. Marcell Lévai Oh, now that you mention it, I don't have the bottom bar anymore. I didn't even notice it. To me if it works as expected, it's not a big deal I guess.

Disqusser Yes WesleySmalls Maybe it was part of the test? ahnafm Google: "It's not a bug, it's a feature!" ro964 I don't want to jinx myself, but Play Store is fine on my Project Fi Nexus 5X - for now. Abhishek Maurya And I am from those people, Google now shows "failed to load cards" Jordan L My Google Now cards broke. The fix worked for me. I'm on the beta Google App, if this server side test was only for beta users then we can't get so pissed. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Today's "Google Screwup of the Day". Maxime MARAIS Is there something to do with sudent "Google Play Services stopped working" is see several times a day since yesterday? Does anyone faces this kind of issue too (on good old Nexus 5, for example)? Ron johnson Broken on my phone, but works on my tablet. deckhanddave Mines been off for days and I find out why in an online article? Google are starting to p*ss me off. What this article didn't say was that you also have to reinstall google after clearing the memory. NavyVeteran And the Google app itself. Dracinn I thing Android in general has been broken lately wether it be hardware or software. Rob DeMillo Had this problem on my Sony Xperia Z3c tablet. Tried the recommended fix, rebooted, and.... Google now no longer appears when I swipe right. It act as though that screen no longer exists. The step missing from the article is: go to your app, select the Google app and restart it by selecting "Get Started." Google Now will then restart and recover your data. Diego Well thank you for this. I did the steps and had no Google now. But after this it's back Rob DeMillo Glad it worked! CommentatusMaximus Was wondering what happened to Google Now. Figured out the memory reset trick myself, all's good now. Sergiu I see is a very common thing to test on production. Even Google does it. :) Bill M Push test on Friday so nobody is in house to fix it ;) It would be nice if they would test in-house -before- they subject customers to the results. I believe (from experience) that the play store server side test may be over... or they just removed my account from it as a band-aid. balcobomber25 Pretty soon there will be no more Google Now. lomsha I thought it was because I'm running O. Bill M I spoke too soon. I can now see content but the feature carousel isn't there. It shows up if I use an alternate google account to access the play store. This leads me to think I'm still stuck with a half fixed test version for my account. I guess maybe if you opt in for any apps beta you get put on googles lab rat list for any of their product updates? Idk, how they decided who got it but unlike any app beta in the store there isn't any way to leave. kerrhome Google Play Music was down for me as well. My Huawei Watch play store wanted me to re-buy several apps. Also, weather card was not the right city for me. All is back to normal now, but wow, lots of screw ups.

The project has a very basic and barebones graphical user interface now. The home screen is a giant vertically scrolling list. In the center you'll see a (placeholder) profile picture, the date, a city name, and a battery icon. Above the are "Story" cards - basically Recent Apps - and below it is a scrolling list of suggestions, sort of like a Google Now placeholder. Leave the main screen and you'll see a Fuchsia "home" button pop up on the bottom of the screen, which is just a single white circle. The GUI is called Armadillo, and Hotfixit.net has instructions on how to build it, and a video of it in action. Google still hasn't said anything about Fuchsia's purpose or intended goal, but Travis Geiselbrecht did state in IRC that it isn't a toy, and it isn't a 20% project. At this point, the safest bet is to just call it a research operating system, but of course, it's exciting to imagine this brand new open source operating system having a bigger role to play.

At least eight civilians were killed on both sides in fighting that began when a Pakistani census team accompanied by soldiers visited disputed villages along the southern border on Friday. Pakistan inherited its 2,400-kilometre (1,500-mile) border with its western neighbor when it gained independence from Britain in 1947, but Afghanistan has never formally recognized it. And while official Afghan maps reflect the so-called "Durand Line", many nationalists believe the true border of their country ends at the River Indus that runs though Pakistan and gave India its name. "Officials from the geological survey departments of the two countries will conduct a survey, and they will also make use of Google Maps," said a senior Pakistani security source in Islamabad who requested anonymity. Abdul Razeq, the police chief of Afghanistan's Kandahar province, added: "After negotiations, both sides have agreed that a geological survey should be conducted. "Technical teams of both countries will use GPS and Google Maps as well as other means to get the answer." Internet firm Google complies with local laws in certain countries that compel it to show borders in line with national demands. For instance, its Indian site shows the entirety of disputed Kashmir as controlled by India.  In Pakistan, however, the site shows the internationally recognized de facto border, the Line of Control, marked with a dotted line to denote it is disputed.  In 2010 Google was embroiled in a Central American border dispute that saw two neighboring countries dispatch troops and heavily armed police to their joint border.  The incident happened after a Nicaraguan commander cited Google's version of the border map in an interview with Costa Rican newspaper La Nacion to justify a raid on a disputed area of Costa Rica. Google later said it had made a mistake and corrected its map to reflect one sanctioned by the U.S. State Department. Pakistan last year began trying to harden the traditionally soft border with Afghanistan through trenching and fencing, but its efforts were met with hostility from Kabul. Ethnic Pashtuns living in the region have traditionally paid it little heed. Villages straddling the frontier have mosques and houses with one door in Pakistan and another in Afghanistan. Pakistani forces on Sunday elevated their rhetoric when they said they had also killed "more than 50 soldiers" in last week's border clashes -- a claim quickly rejected by Kabul, which said it lost two soldiers.

The Booming Market for Your Online Identity Here's how Evernote moved 3 petabytes of data to Google's cloud Windows 10's privacy settings will be simpler but more limited with Creators'... Video Nvidia Shield console hands-on: Powerful PC gaming in a $200 Android TV box There’s a decent chance you're part of Oracle’s next big business. Not selling products to you, but selling you as a product. That's the idea behind the Oracle Data Cloud, a massive pool of information about consumers and companies. The tech titan has put it together by tracking people across the web and buying data from a variety of sources. People who have their data included may not even know that they’ve opted in for that data collection. There’s no big red button that someone has to click in order to be a part of the company's data collection machine. Instead, its base of user data is fed by a network of third parties. The Data Cloud is primarily fed by three types of sources: publishers, like Forbes and Edmunds, retail loyalty programs, and traditional data brokers like Experian and IHS. All of that adds up to a database of 5 billion consumer profiles, fed by 15 million data sources. Not every profile corresponds to a unique person -- people can have multiple profiles -- but Oracle has information on billions of people, according to Eric Roza, the vice president of Data Cloud. Using data science techniques, Oracle works to match activity from one browser to others, so companies can make sure the same ads get shown to people on their smartphones, tablets, and computers. Oracle sees Data Cloud as a key part of its future. The service is being used to help advertisers and publishers better target ads, and it’s attractive to businesses because it's not tied to a major advertising platform like Google's or Facebook's. The Data Cloud also forms the foundation of machine learning features inside other Oracle software. One of the challenges for companies doing machine learning is getting data sets that are large enough to build accurate models, and Data Cloud can help solve that problem. But the benefits are mostly borne by Oracle's business customers, who stand to make more money as a result of using Data Cloud enhanced services. The boon to consumers whose data are being used is less defined. Oracle isn't alone in this sort of tracking. There are dozens of companies that exist for the sole purpose of collecting consumer data and then reselling that to other businesses. Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and other tech titans have made big money from accumulating customer data and using it to sell ads. But what makes the Data Cloud different from something like Google's ad business is that consumers might not know their behavior is being stored for resale, or how broadly it's shared. Just because someone visits a page on Forbes doesn't mean they'd expect that information to influence a marketing campaign on a radically different website, but that's what the Data Cloud enables. Partners feeding data into Oracle's Data Cloud must agree they have user permission to collect information. But acquiring that permission is as simple as burying a few sentences deep in a privacy policy. While some might call out Oracle Data Cloud by name, most don't.  "Typically, because these things are quite common practice now, there's a more generalized statement [like] some version of 'we use this data to inform our own advertising, and select third-party partners,'" Roza said. Users can opt out from the data collection in a variety of ways, according to Roza. Oracle allows people to install a special cookie in each of the browsers they use to prevent tracking. Deleting the cookie or using a new browser would erase that protection, however. Some publishers may allow customers to opt out of data sharing, and advertising industry groups also support opting out. But actually knowing whether or not you're included in the Data Cloud is the first part of the battle. And that's not the easiest thing to figure out. Meanwhile, Oracle is continuing to pour money into the business and tout it to customers. The company has spent billions on acquisitions to build the Data Cloud, which was created through bringing companies like BlueKai, Datalogix, and Moat into the fold.

Google’s low-cost Chromebooks are by far the most popular school-provided device, with 42 percent of educators and administrators saying they use them often. The next closest number is 15 percent for PC laptops. (EdWeek Chart) And it’s not just hardware. Google for Education, and its G Suite, which includes programs like Gmail, Hangouts, Drive and more, are the most frequently used set of productivity tools in 68 percent of U.S. classrooms. Microsoft productivity tools are the top choice in 17 percent of classrooms, and Apple tools are popular in only 1 percent of classrooms. So why Google? Its products are easy to use, educators and administrators say, and affordable. “It is compatible with other educational sites and easy for students to access at home,” a Houston-area teacher surveyed by EdWeek wrote. “Many children don’t have computers, and Google makes it easy to do assignments from their phones.” Beyond products, educators and administrators have the most faith in Google’s ability to help students learn. In response to a hypothetical question where educators were allowed to hire one company to increase student achievement, Google was far and away the top choice at 52 percent. Apple Education was the second most common choice at 13 percent. Microsoft came in sixth out of eight companies at 6 percent. Amazon was only favored by 1 percent of educators. (EdWeek Chart) Educators don’t see Google losing its lead any time soon. EdWeek asked school administrators, including superintendents and chief financial officers, about future school district spending on various devices over the next couple years, and 90 percent said their schools would increase investments in Chromebooks. For reference, the next most popular device by this metric was the iPad, with 33 percent predicting increased investment. Microsoft Surface devices and PC laptops got lukewarm receptions in terms of future investments. About 29 percent of educators predicted greater spending on PC laptops with 26 percent seeing more Surface devices coming to classrooms. On the flipside, 22 percent and 19 percent of educators predict a decline in spending on PC laptops and Surfaces, respectively. As Microsoft and Google battle it out, Amazon is quickly becoming a major player in the education technology scene, according to an analysis of the study by EdWeek Senior Editor Sean Cavanaugh. Many schools use Amazon Web Services for cloud storage, and the online retail giant has a marketplace customized for education. Amazon is also testing a service called Amazon Inspire, which is focused on “the search, discovery, and sharing of digital educational resources.” Nat Levy is a staff reporter at Geekwire covering a variety of technology topics, including Microsoft, Amazon, tech startups, and the intersection of technology with real estate, courts and government.

Google's "Fuchsia" operating system is taking shape with a new design Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/08 10:01am PDTMay 8, 2017 29 Plus 1 on G+ 243 Share on Facebook 78 Share on Twitter Total Shares350 Development Google News We first talked about Fuchsia, a new operating system being developed at Google, back in August (in fact, it was my first post here). At the time, there wasn't much to get excited about besides the potential - it only had a command-line interface. Now the project has a snazzy new, but clearly unfinished, interface. Summary of Fuchsia First, it's worth going over exactly what Fuchsia is, because it's been quite a while since we talked about it. As opposed to all of Google's other OSes, such as Android and Chrome OS, Fuchsia uses the company's new 'Magenta' kernel instead of Linux. According to the project's documentation, Magenta is designed for "modern phones and modern personal computers with fast processors, non-trivial amounts of ram with arbitrary peripherals doing open ended computation." Magenta's apps and the system interface are written with Google's Flutter SDK, which was initially designed to create cross-platform apps for iOS and Android. Flutter applications are written in Dart, the company's home-grown programming language. All of the system and apps are rendered by 'Escher,' which uses OpenGL or Vulkan to display everything. The 'Armadillo' interface So, on to the new stuff. Fuchsia's system UI has a new name - 'Armadillo.' Ars Technica was able to compile Armadillo into an Android APK, since it is written with the above-mentioned Flutter SDK. The interface doesn't really do anything besides looking pretty, but it does give us an idea of what the finished product could look like. The home screen is a vertical list, with a profile picture, the time, and a battery indicator in the center. Tapping the profile picture brings up something similar to Android's Quick Settings, with toggles for auto-rotate, do not disturb, Airplane Mode, and so on. Above the profile picture is the 'Story,' which the documentation describes as "a set of apps and/or modules that work together for the user to achieve a goal." Currently, this works similarly to Android's Recents screen. Users will also be able to combine stories into a 'Story Cluster.' This is what dragging a Story card into split-screen looks like. Dragging a Story card onto another one triggers a split-screen mode. The user can split an app 50/50 vertically or horizontally, drag in another app for a 33/33/33 split, or even have a tab bar appear for using all the open apps in full-screen. You can even have two apps split vertically next to two other split apps, seen below. This is far more flexible than Android's current multi-tasking functionality, but whether or not it will stay this way is uncertain. Below the profile picture is a panel resembling Google Now, with a placeholder search bar and suggestion cards. Armadillo's documentation says, "a suggestion is a representation of an action the user can take to augment an existing story or to start a new one. [The] suggestion contains enough information to create the visual representation of that concept." So maybe they will work more like an app launcher? It's hard to tell at this point. The Google Now panel, showing Fuchsia's keyboard. Keep in mind that all of this is subject to change, as the Armadillo interface (and the rest of Fuchsia OS) is still under heavy development. It's also hard to tell what Google's plans are for the operating system. Will it be neglected to Internet-of-Things devices and other basic hardware, or will it some day replace Android altogether? We'll have to wait and see.

Suicide_Note Because Google can. Corbin Davenport Ron from Ars Technica put it best: "Fuchsia really seems like a project that asks 'how would we design Android today, if we could start over?' It's a brand-new, Google-developed kernel running a brand-new, Google-developed SDK that uses a brand-new, Google-developed programming language and it's all geared to run Google's Material Design interface as quickly as possible. Google gets to dump Linux and the GPL, it can dump Java and the problems it caused with Oracle, and Google can basically insulate itself from all of Android's upstream projects and bring all the development in-house. Doing such a thing on the scale of Android today would be a massive project." makapav Would it still be open source? Also, what would happen to all the existing APKs? Corbin Davenport Fuchisa is completely open source right now. As for running Android apps, maybe Google will add some kind of stop-gap compatibility layer for running Android apps, like Chrome OS has. destinyhud read the article Suicide_Note Perhaps instead of replacing Android, this will *become* Android, as in Android P or Q? Or be the merger of Android/Chrome? m477 I could see that as Android 10. Definitely too early for P. morteum I wonder if the reason it is called "Armadillo" is because they're starting from A again, but this time they're using animals instead of desserts. Christopher Bement I think it's a smart plan, based on the guess that there's more animals to pick from in the world than tasty desserts. teolinux Ubuntu docet Paul "Tasty treats," not necessarily desserts. That said, armadillos could be a tasty treat. I won't judge. MJ I have heard desserts and candy used before which are wrong but "tasty treats" is a new one for me. To be more accurate, Android names are actually all confectionery foods. A "tasty treat" could be a slice of pizza (aka Android S). LOL Randy Gindy Armadillo is the name of the UI not the OS build itself. Matt74UK Smooth on the inside, crunchy on the outside. Armadillo ! (a few UK people of a certain age may get that). John Doe Idk this is a whole new OS with a new kernel, I doubt this will be done with an OTA update for Android. Mantas Pakėnas Even nowadays, some of Android's new functionality cannot be done via OTA updates (like dual system partitions, forced encryption I believe, etc). To make a completely hard cut sometime when this is ready, and if it's meant to replace Android, is not completely unimaginable. As is updating via OTA. If apple was able to change their file system via OTA, I don't see why changing most of the parts would not be possible. However, nobody aside from Google would do it, almost guaranteed :) Suicide_Note It could likely be done for Pixel devices, and possibly for future devices released after this new version of the OS rolls out. Adrian Meredith quite possibly, after all there no reason it couldn't also run android apps jonathan What they need to do is make this googles very own os for their pixel line and leave android for the oems Suicide_Note Not a chance. To much name recognition with Android for Google to drop it in favor of something else specific to the Pixel lineup. Dallas King Android Z confirmed! Suicide_Note More like Android A for Armadillo. m477 APK plz (no, really, I want a compiled apk the demo) Maxwell “Max” Weinbach https://github.com/fuchsia-mirror/sysui MJ Your link wasn't what the OP asked for... Maxwell “Max” Weinbach the only way to get the APK is to compile it yourself, so I linked to the Github page to a place to download the files to compile. The closest they will get. MJ Than you should have replied there is no known APK or not at all. Maxwell “Max” Weinbach It does not matter that much. I am building the APK right now. Once it is done I will post it. Here is the link on how to compile it. http://www.hotfixit.net/single-post/2017/05/03/How-to-build-Armadillo MJ Don't waste your time... They updated that article with an download of the APK. Maxwell “Max” Weinbach thanks. they just did that. I still compiled it myself though. I will try to get more out of it while I have the Sysui downloaded. Michel R. https://www.androidfilehost.com/?w=files&flid=178684 there you go MJ http://www.hotfixit.net/single-post/2017/05/03/How-to-build-Armadillo Latex beats nudity More of Proprietary code ? No thank you, we already had enough with this Pixel crud. I hope this OS dies quicker or become a chromebook OS. m477 It's open source. Latex beats nudity It's OSS but just like Android It'll be more heavily dependent on the google APIs to make it work. Look at the Pixel SysUI, Just being OSS doesn't make it open source... It's Google's OS not a Linux Based one. If this is going to replace Android It's doomsday on multiple levels. destinyhud billions of people dont care if its running linux kernel or not. maybe very few like u might. do iphone users care why kernel it runs. none of them care. u r just noise tbh Latex beats nudity Billions of people don't code. You are being a kool-aid joke tbh. destinyhud exaclt only few code and even on that few many dont care if it runs linux or not. look at iphone there are more dev there and yet they dont care for kernel. u r delusional in ur own world m477 Android it's already been on a Google-dependent road for years. I don't think this is going to change either way. An Angry Chihuahua https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/magenta/+/master/docs/getting_started.md heres the source code. do some research my dude WitnessG Imagining this running on a Google made processor is exciting. Badouken If this was the OS for the Pixel 2 alongside a Google made processor I think id cry! WitnessG Yeah I don't see this coming out for at least another 2-3 years. Badouken Indeed, but we can dream! ha Suicide_Note Maybe the Pixel 3 or 4 will see the dream become reality. Suicide_Note I'm betting this is what we'll see in a couple years time. As another commenter stated, starting with Armadillo could be Google's way of starting from the beginning (letter A codename), since there's more animal babes to use for each letter than there are dessert names to use. Timothy Vreeland You are getting the furries excited. Nomaan Armadillo should be compared to holo/material and not to dessert names. nachofrand What makes you think Google would be good at making SoCs? They're a software company and don't have the hardware expertise for hardcore ASIC development like that. Granted they can hire people, but in the end, does it matter? They're going to use ARM either way. UnlikeABoss Google fanboyism. The same reason he's excited over a brand new OS. He knows absolutely nothing about it, short of the fact that it will create more fragmentation not only in the OS space, but also the kernel space. So all we know are negative things so far. This is what we call exciting now is it? Why? Just because Google is doing it? If Microsoft made this exact same announcement, would we all be excited? Oh dear. Zsolt V No, because essentially everybody loathes Microsoft. Almost nobody's life would be worse if Microsoft vanished. marcusmarcus2 Don't they design and build their own servers to use for all their websites? Seems like those hardware work well for them. Sergii Pylypenko It's one thing to assemble the server using off-the-shelf components, or even to order a custom motherboard. It's a very different thing to design and manufacture your own chips. marcusmarcus2 I'm not saying it is the same, just that they are not only software experts. Them designing and building the servers show they do have hardware expertise that could assist them in doing the same to chips. Zsolt V Except Google's servers are not assembled from off the shelf components. Haven't been for a few years now. Roy What about TPU? Adrian Vovk Samsung Exynos devices are faster than Snapdragon, iPhones seem underpowered but are extremely snappy, etc. The point is that making both the software and hardware leads to a very fast ecosystem. Also, Google are making the TPU for neural networks nachofrand Yes, as expected. Exynos is faster than Snapdragon on the Galaxy phones, but put an Exynos in another phone...oh wait, you can't. That's the whole entire point. Snapdragon SoCs are general purpose SoCs and can be used for a multitude of phones so they're not custom tuned to every phone individually. Exynos have very specific power rails and the chip is made specifically for that phone. The thing is, sure this is better, but it's marginal and hardly worth talking about. They both use the same ARM architecture so performance gains are pretty negligible. Besides that, this is how Samsung makes money....off of device sales. Google doesn't make money that way. That isn't their business model so at this point it doesn't make sense for them to build their own SoCs when they could just work closer with hardware companies. They make their own TPUs because it aligns with their business model. Adrian Vovk The instruction set doesn't really matter? I can have a 6700k and a 6500k and the 6700k will perform much better even though they are both amd64. With what Google is doing with the Pixels (still as snappy as day one here) I'm pretty sure they can optimize it further than Samsung does. They have made it run smoother in some cases on a chip that they didn't manufacture. If they made their own chip it would allow them many freedoms that they otherwise don't have = easier design of the device. I brought up the TPUs because that is experience in chip manufacturing Jason What makes you say iPhones are under powered ? Apples chips are some of the fastest around and are extremely powerful. Adrian Vovk Specs wise. They have much worse specs on paper and it would lead to a slower experience, except Apple can optimize it because they make both the chip and the OS Stephen Sharp They could use Risc-V and have to pay to license absolutely nothing, while being able to make processors purpose built for their OS Randy Gindy That would be an interesting move. Stephen Sharp Indeed, I really want Risc-V to succeed as an open ISA nachofrand They could. But in my opinion, it's unlikely. Google isn't trying to compete with Samsung and Apple in device sales and that isn't their business model. People using their services so they can show ads is their business model. It doesn't make sense for Google to make their own SoC when others are already doing a good job. Plus, if they went to RISC-V then what? What about the modem? They have to buy a standalone modem from Qualcomm or Intel. Now you have to hire system integration and test engineers to make sure the modem is working with your SoC. Oh and then you need a whole firmware team to control the modem. At that point, buy a full blown SoC with the modem on chip. Stephen Sharp Eh you lost me at "Pixel phone" and all the other hardware they sell. Google also is a Platinum member of the Risc-V foundation, and if there is a direction they are going, more control or less control, I would guess it's "more". But that's just a guess nachofrand Hardware isn't even close to the same thing as asic development. IC design is a different world. Granted they do some custom hardware, but SoCs are a much much larger feat. It's still a possibility they do so, but it doesn't make sense with their current business model imo. Captain On! 1 - Google has stated that they're going to make their own silicon for the Pixels in time. 2 - Google actually owns/operates the world's most powerful quantum computer. They know how to make chips. Randy Gindy That quantum computer was built by DWave though Angel I read (somewhere don’t remember) that they have three different quantum computers systems. One from DWave and two home-produced. From those two, one was made by engineers and not that disimilar from DWave in its operations. The other was made by physicists and uses a different approach. nachofrand 1. I could be wrong, but I've only read that they plan on working closer with chip manufacturers. 2. Google didn't make that computer. Even if they did, quantum is so different those skills don't even translate. Romario Maxwell Google made their own custom ASIC called the Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) for their AI/Machine Learning needs on their cloud platform. See https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2016/05/Google-supercharges-machine-learning-tasks-with-custom-chip.html and https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2017/04/quantifying-the-performance-of-the-TPU-our-first-machine-learning-chip.html nachofrand Sure, although a TPU is just an accelerator. Think of it as the hexagon DSP inside of the Snapdragon SoC. That's like 1/10 of the entire chip. SoC design is much larger. Timothy Vreeland How many examples of hardware design do people have to point out before you stop? Sure the hardware they worked on previously isn't exactly the same... But before they started the hardware they are currently working on, they worked on previous hardware that wasn't the same as what they are doing now. They have shown they are competent in designing many kinds of hardware. Or do you suggest a company can only build one kind of hardware and nothing else for all eternity? How did Samsung make it's current in-house chips? Did they go to ARM college? Have they been making ARM chips since the dawn of time? No. They put together some teams and got to work, so stop blabbing and being negative. sweenish Their AI that finally beat the world's top Go players was running on custom Google chips. It's not like they don't know how. Pixelexel Imagine a Google Pixel with a Google made processor, with Fuschia, with Project Fi with Google WiFi powered by Google fiber. If I'd have this, my life would be complete. Iamsecond Ha, no. A Google processor? Supported for 18 months, then replaced with a new processor that performs half as well (but has stickers.) Does not fully process Android code, because at Google one hand doesn't even know the other hand is there, let alone talk to it. Has 20 cores (only 2 enabled outside US for 'reasons.') Has a dedicated co-processor to enable ads in every app, even those that previously didn't have them. Jason Google can't even get a phone out the door without issues and you want them to make the chips too...lol. I'll pass. UnlikeABoss "In house kernel instead of Linux". Yeah, hopefully this dies in a thousand pits of fire. "Hey Linux guys, you know how you've helped us make billions over the years with a free open source kernel? Well, we were just using you to get the "nerd" userbase. Now we own the market thanks to you guys promoting its use of Linux, we will gradually phase you out." .... m477 I hope not. Linux is not really a kernel made with smartphone in minds. I don't care for being a fan of a kernel over another. UnlikeABoss Yeah. I'd much rather use a brand new untested kernel (and all the teething issues that will come with it) in my smartphone than a mature, stable one that's hacked on by hundreds and thousands of people every month. I mean, it's just a smartphone, we don't need it to be a secure environment, right? Let's just make a nice obscure kernel that no one else will use, and just say "but but it's open source!!! love us because we are Google kk". ... ihsan ışık I'm sorry but it just looks like you are a huge Linux fan and are just against change to me. UnlikeABoss Looks can be deceiving. If you're going to fling around the Linux fanboy term, i'll fling around the Google fanboy term, and that will surely be a nice constructive argument that we will both want to continue. m477 So, in 10 years we should still be using an unoptimised kernel like Linux, because anything newer is, well, newer? UnlikeABoss Yeah, because Linux hasn't changed at all in 10 years... m477 Yes, it changed a lot, and it still has many of the same problems, which are intrinsically bound to its structure. It's not a kernel well suited for mobile devices. UnlikeABoss You think the solution is to throw it out the window and start from scratch? I disagree. I'd much rather continue improving the Linux kernel, simply because of all the eyes it will always have on its code. jonathan Play nice ladies lol m477 With this mentality we wouldn't have Linux at all. Why start anything, while we can continue this other thing which purpose was completely different? A mircokenel is more well suited than a monolitic kernel to a mobile devices, both in terms of performance and security. No matter how much you improve Linux, it will never be a microkernel. UnlikeABoss Smartphones don't need a micro kernel in 2017. You could make that argument 7 years ago. Linux can be compiled with the required drivers just like it always could. m477 I made that argument 7 years ago. They always needed something different from Linux. The fact that specific, even proprietary drivers have to be integrated in the kernel (since Android lacks an abstraction layer) is on of the problems of the interaction Android-Linux. destinyhud why havent the nerds made linux on pc's a bigger market share if they were the one who made android a global leader UnlikeABoss No nerd is promoting Linux on the desktop. All social media used to be full of people promoting Android over iOS, these days there's no need to. destinyhud why havent they promoted desktop?? just wondering why they did for android but not for desktop.. linux on desktop was an underdog for decades. android was not popular because of kernal. android became popular because it was opensource and was the only viable competition to ios. people dont care what kernel it runs. UnlikeABoss No nerd worth their salt would promote an environment that would be a downgrade from Windows. Android was not a downgrade from iOS at any point in time, it had a very equal playing field. There's a difference between promoting a good solid FOSS kernel where possible, and promoting an agenda. m477 Android was not a downgrade from iOS at any point in time By this, I get that you never used Android and iOS side by side in 2009-10. UnlikeABoss You clearly value different things. The hackability alone made it an upgrade through its lifetime. m477 The same can be said for GNU/Linux on desktop. UnlikeABoss No it can't, because hackability =/= app availability. i.e. The hackability on Linux desktop doesn't make it win over it's lack of apps, where that isn't an issue on Android. m477 App availability was horrible in the early days, compared to iOS. Even Symbian had more apps. UnlikeABoss That was fine since the early days didn't consist of using your smartphone for very much, due to under powered hardware. Techies didn't go around saying "use iOS because we can all take selfies and stick filters on it". m477 iOS devices didn't have front cameras until mid 2010. The system was better, faster, smoother, the interface was coesive, there were many more apps, and the jailbreak community, to address the techie audience you like to go on about so much, was very, very good. There were tweaks and modifications that even the wildest Android custom ROM didn't have at the time. Android was objectively a downgrade, as much as Linux was on desktop. UnlikeABoss Calling jailbraik an advantage over a FOSS OS is pretty hilarious. iOS wasn't popular because it was better, it was popular because of the amount of people getting their advice from paid employees in store. "Buy iOS so we get a commission". m477 iPhone was more popular for various reasons: marketing, having 2 years of advantage, and, yes, more marketing. But it was also better than Android, as an OS. What benefit did Android bring, with it being opensource, compared to iOS, even to a "techie"? The dev community was laughable in the early days. Why GNU/Linux on desktop was not promoted by "techies" (which is false) and Android was, even if their shortcomings were identical? destinyhud u live in a dream world. even most dev dont care about kernel. what they care about the dev platform. I am a dev and i dont care for the kernel UnlikeABoss If you're talking from the perspective of an app developer then ofcourse you don't care about the kernel, you care about which platform will make you the most money... destinyhud exactly. no one care what kernel it runs.. all dev care is what platform make money. so who is this nerd who care about kernel if most dont care about the kernel.. yeah very very few.. infact rare like u UnlikeABoss Techie == Technology Enthusiast. You can sit here and tell me that you would use the best dev environment all you want but the truth is if the iOS dev environment was awful you'd still suck it up and use it to make your money. I'm not sure how you can class yourself as an enthusiast at that point. destinyhud ever wonder why no one is up voting u and upvoting many of my comments? because what u say is BS. its that simple. I am up for ditching outdated linux if the new kernal is modern and build for modern devices. most dont care for this very few techies.. i hope this becomes true and linux kernel die.. UnlikeABoss "Ever wonder why Google fanboys upvote pro Google content and not anti-Google content?" No, no I don't wonder that. How dare someone critique a pointless change by Google, causing unnecessary fragmentation. Burn them! destinyhud u must be new here.. look at anti google comments here when they make stupid changes but if they make welcome changes people tend to agree UnlikeABoss No, I've been here a long time and made many anti-Google comments as well as pro-Google. No one in the right mind would cheer on kernel fragmentation other than those that think Google can do no wrong. destinyhud open up ur comments history and let me see if u made pro google comments. i have a feeling u r a troll UnlikeABoss Yeah, this discussion is going no where. You are not the authority here and the idea that you want to browse my history to make sure I fall in line is creepy as hell. Bye. destinyhud lol i see u dont want to open ur comments history. obvious troll m477 outdated linux i hope this becomes true and linux kernel die Woah, wait a second here. Linux is not outdated, and its death would be terrible for everyone. It's just that it's not the most apt kernel for a mobile device. destinyhud maybe not outdated but not the right fit for mobile devices. destinyhud android sucked when compared to ios.. it was a downgrade compared to ios. why did dev promote android and not desktop linux? u reasoning dont even make sense. UnlikeABoss No, it wasn't a downgrade. destinyhud yes, it was back in android initial release. iOS was better and much more polished at that time. but things changed now. UnlikeABoss "Polished" is not a factor that is used to judge a better OS. There are Linux environments that are much more polished than Windows 10, but that doesn't make desktop Linux better. destinyhud it was both polished and runs better than android at that time. polished was not the only one. it was also polished. android only got better later.. i have used android at that time and it sucked big time. UnlikeABoss You are using today's standards to judge it. If you do that, they both sucked. It worked perfectly fine for the basic things people were using it for at the time. destinyhud they both sucked at that time but android sucked more than iOS at that time. SVem26 I like to think I am in the nerd userbase and I don't care what kernel is used.. can you help me understand why it matters? UnlikeABoss Do you want a brand new obscure kernel in thing that holds most of your sensitive details? TipTop I don't want something that dates back to 90s, is full of zero-days and horrible code contributed by nobodies. UnlikeABoss The idea that it is full of zero days is hilarious. You do realize that the majority of Linux exploits are local, right? Unlike Windows. Yes there is obviously code from the 90s, but very, very little of it. Not to mention that age is not a factor in deciding bad code. The idea that old code is bad code shows your inexperience. By that standard, should we dismiss Chrome because of all the exploits being found in code that was written when it first started? Are we going to create brand new software every few years to purge "old code"? Do you have any idea whatsoever how much Linux has actually changed? Do you have any idea how much of this change is because it's considered a "universal" kernel everyone can use and is focusing on? Do you really think splitting the community over onto another kernel will increase security for either of those kernels? There's a little something called code maturity. There's a reason Microsoft has way less exploits in its kernel today than 10 years ago. They didn't write a new kernel from scratch. Sir_Brizz All OSes are full of vulnerabilities and horrible code written by nobodies. If that is your requirement then you must have gone full luddite by now. ihsan ışık Are you implying that Android got popular because of "nerds" who heard it uses the Linux kernel? UnlikeABoss If you are old enough to know the early days of android you'll know that having every single nerd on the internet promoting Android over iOS most certainly helped get the ball rolling. Once it was pushed, it snowballed into what it is today. m477 Sure. It was the nerds on the internet, not the manufacturers with ads everywhere. Most people still don't know their Galaxy runs Android. UnlikeABoss The giant billboards came YEARS afterwards, cmon. m477 Yes, and that's why Android was so unpopular in the early days. UnlikeABoss What? It was massively popular among all techies for being the open source iOS alternative. m477 You are overestimating the "techies" crowd. Even BlackBerryOS was more popular at the time. Only after the Galaxy S it started to grow, and became popular among normal people. UnlikeABoss Not really. We are talking over a decade ago now, there were far less people on the internet and it was far easier for techies to promote products because everyone was asking their "techie" friend what is best. But these days everyone is an "expert" so that's not as much of a thing. m477 Again, you overestimate how many techies there actually were. Your personal experience is anecdotal. Market shares and sell data are objective. Also, over a decade ago Android was still a camera os, and it wasn't public. UnlikeABoss No, I do not. The further back in time you go, the higher the proportion of techies there were using the internet versus others. People were only just starting to look at buying a smartphone, and asking techies what they should buy. m477 Yes, the concentration on the internet of "techies" on the internet was greater. And? What normal user at the time went to the internet, looked at reviews and said "Oh, look! The HTC magic has Linux! This random guy says its good, so I'm gonna buy it!"? You really think that a bunch of "techies">marketing? A guy saying that his toy-looking HTC G1 is better than the iPhone is more effective than billboards and tv ads? Come on, even Windows Mobile was more popular. It took Samsung's aggressive marketing to make Android popular. UnlikeABoss Windows Mobile and BlackBerry were more popular in the enterprise, that's it. The entire discussion is home users. Also I think there's been some confusion. I wasn't implying that techies on the internet were promoting Android on the internet like a marketing department. I was implying that the internet was very much a "social media" platform for techies to communicate where the majority of them would use Android and mocked the use of iOS. The actual "marketing" happened offline when a normal user would ask their "techie" friend for first time buying advice. It is nothing like that today, and the internet is nothing like the techie community it once was. m477 So, what you're saying is that the internet was a circlejerk of Android users. Ok, and? It didn't affected normal users the slightest, iOS was still more popular until Samsung took Android more seriously. The techie friend thing its only your anecdotal experience, it bears no influence on the market, in the grand scheme of things. I'd even argue that Google's very light marketing did much, much more. Also, the mindless techies that recommended half backed devices instead of better alternatives because "Uh, Linux!!" did more harm than good, both to the users and to Android. UnlikeABoss If you read my OP you'll see my original point was that Google has rode the "Android circlejerk" to popularity, and you can debate how much popularity that added as much as you want. The fact remains, it got the ball rolling. Samsung didn't pick it up "just because", it saw that a lot of people were pushing it. There were several OS at the time it could have used, including sticking to its own. Why bother with Android? Maybe because it wanted to see how much market it could take by appealing to techies? However, if you stand back and look at it, how is this any different from "embrace, extend, extinguish"? Google used that "free marketing" and has now decided to use it's massive popularity to push a different product. (Which has failed in the past and will hopefully fail again). Why hate Microsoft for doing that in the past, but we praise Google for doing it? Why are we excited for something we know nothing about that is creating fragmentation? m477 Samsung had used several OSes, it had Windows Mobile and Phone devices, Symbian devices, and proprietary devices, even Palm OS devices IIRC. They used them all. Android had was the easiest to personalise for them, and create a copy of the best selling product, which was the iPhone, and there was an app market, so they tried to release and market their flagship with it, and market it as broadly as Apple. The first Galaxy (the "non S") was was vastly ignored, because it was as little marketed as all their other devices. The techies crowd was insignificant. The free marketing is just as much as Windows 10 gets for incorporating Ubuntu's bash terminal. What you saw is not really important. I saw lots and lots of Windows Phones in 2010 and 11. Many more than Android devices. Every one I knew had one, and if I had to say which OS was the most popular only based on my personal experience, in my smallish city, I'd obviously would say Windows Phone. Why are you so attached to Linux, excluding all possibilities of giving a possibly better solution a try? The community will just fork the AOSP and continue the development of the Linux branch. UnlikeABoss Cmon, we both know Android was not easier for them to customize than simply using their own OS. No one was recommending it, techie or not, no matter how much they marketed. It's only now they are popular they are trying to slip in their own OS, and still failing. I am not attached to Linux despite people using it as an easy scapegoat to dismiss a discussion critiquing almighty Google. We currently have a situation where most kernel developers focus entirely on Linux, making it virtually the universal kernel. Why are we creating pointless fragmentation there? Why divide that community? Do we honestly believe that a divided community can produce a better kernel, or do we love it because Google is doing it? Would we love it if Microsoft did this? m477 The proprietary OS they used at the time was a Java based thing with a flash interface. Hardly able to compete against iOS. It was easier for them to use the "next Symbian" that they could customise as they wanted, and that also had an app market. If they made, say, Bada, before Android become established and popular, and marketed it as much as they did with their Galaxy S, the market would be very different today. The normal user doesn't care what OS their shiny phone runs, as long as there's facebook. I am a GNU/Linux user since the first half of the 2000s, and I've always critiqued Google for using Linux as a kernel on phones. Linux might be the universal kernel, but smartphones need a more streamlined solution. I don't care if it's Google, the MIT, or Richard Stallman in person to do it. I liked WP8 architecture. Fragmentation is not pointless if it brings benefits to the user. TipTop Nobody cares about your FSF agenda. John Q I think the chief reason Google is not using Linux is that they want a real-time OS (RTOS). Linux is at best a "soft" RTOS, possessing a real-time scheduler but this is still not nearly as real-time as an actual RTOS should be. It would take a very large effort to do that for Linux so it makes sense that Google would want to make their own kernel that they can have full control over. UnlikeABoss Let's ignore the fact that Linux is used in real time car systems for a moment. Could you elaborate on why you think Google would want/need a RTOS on their smartphones? M6 The kernel they're using, 'magenta', is opened source. So who cares if they're using linux or not? Does everyone have to use linux? UnlikeABoss No it doesn't have to be Linux. But who else will use Magenta? Probably no one. So why are we fragmenting the kernel space further? Why would you choose an immature kernel for something as valuable (your data) as your smartphone. Would you trust that? I would much rather developers continue focusing on a single kernel. WesleySmalls But wouldn't Magenta be this single kernel? UnlikeABoss If everyone decided to ditch Linux and focus purely on Magenta as the universal kernel, yes. Will that happen? WesleySmalls Could be, just not overnight. The market was already fairly well developed when Linux arrived in 1991, yet it still managed to become a very, if not the most, important player in the market. It's certainly possible, it will just require proper investment(and neglect of their alternate platforms) and patience to make it work M6 That's some straight up communist shit right there. Let's just work on one thing, because we only need one thing, everything else is redundant! Let's not allow other people to do the same thing in a different way, because competition totally doesn't spur innovation at all. WORPspeed So Andromeda definitely dead or still happening? sleepinlight Pretty sure this IS Andromeda, or at least a part of it. Andromeda was never an official name for anything, it was just the internal project name for some sort of new and/or merged OS. WORPspeed I thought Andromeda specifically referred to merging Android and Chrome OS. So is that specific merger dead or on life-support? John Q Nah, the Android/Chrome merger was just speculation from what Andromeda seemed to be. There was never any concrete evidence to imply that Andromeda was a merger. WORPspeed To quote Androidpolice : "So please, when you see Fuchsia mentioned, or speculation that it "is" Andromeda, know that it is just that: speculation. Last we heard from sources we consider extremely reliable, Android was the basis of Andromeda, and Andromeda would see its commercial debut on a new Pixel laptop later this year. It is possible Google has changed plans around Andromeda, that the initiative itself may have even been scrapped. Though, we have no reason to think so - it's more that we don't know, and haven't heard anything about Andromeda in quite some time." http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/02/15/speculation-around-googles-fuchsia-os-and-andromeda-is-creating-confusion-and-misinformation/ WORPspeed http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/02/15/speculation-around-googles-fuchsia-os-and-andromeda-is-creating-confusion-and-misinformation/ That makes them seem very separate Srujan https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/e7fda716dfcfdca76e200e51a9c9144c72e183c7e76d36b910c20ee0931aee79.gif destinyhud if this replaces android rather than having 2 separate codebase, I am all up for it. splitting the android community is dangerous senor_heisenberg Well if this does end up being what replaces Android or what Android evolves into, I just hope my apps and whatnot are compatible. Ain't got the time or money to be investing into another ecosystem. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman That's a tricky, double-edged sword. I can't fathom they would not support the old apps, or at least the vast majority of them, for exactly that reason. But in doing so it will likely be held back at least slightly from what it can/should be. Backward-compatibility tends to hold everything back. What I'd wager is we won't see this until hardware's powerful enough to make emulating the old system in a VM relatively cheap and easy, with back-end Play Store penalties to developers who don't shift to the new app models, and then slow phase-outs in stages of the older functionality and support until the new OS is running exclusively its own setup. senor_heisenberg That sounds good. Randy Gindy I think Google porting the Android Run-time to Chrome OS was to see if they could do it. morteum This is old news, I'm waiting for Fuchsia 2.0 Barracuda. /s marcusmarcus2 What if they aren't going by Animal names in general but by mammal names. I'd skip the Fuchsia 2.0 Bandicoot. It will probably be "Crash" prone. Alfonso Surroca Three operating systems is not nearly enough. We need at least two more announced at I/O.

Suicide_Note There is no update problem. Nexus/Pixels run the latest and greatest. OEMs who mess with the OS give their customers severely delayed updates. pfmiller Nexus and Pixels run the latest and greatest for two years. Nobody would accept this OS update situation if it was on a desktop OS. MJ Thank God it's phones we are talking about and not a desktop PC. marcusmarcus2 That is exactly why Windows XP lasted only a couple years before all computers updated to Windows 7... Seriously though. I'm fine with only getting Android version upgrades phones for 2 years. But they really need to extend out security updates beyond 3 years. Suicide_Note This isn't a desktop OS, not to mention people tend to change phones much more often than their desktops. pfmiller Sure it's not a desktop OS, but no sense pretending that what we have leaves nothing to be desired. And sure people change their phones more often that their desktops, but there's absolutely no reason to change every 2 years. Doby Gillis Which is a problem, Einstein. Suicide_Note Not if you're a Nexus/Pixel owner, Dilbert. Randy Gindy I would generally say there is. Android phones are not supported for nearly as long as an iPhone. The reason being that the chip set manufacturers do not release new drivers. Shelly-Man Vol 2 It's looks pretty neat for a development stage. Rami Well Android has to reach Z someday. In the case, Hello Fuchsia! marcusmarcus2 Those split-screens will be really useful for running of of Google's different messaging apps. Hopefully OS's aren't the new messaging apps of Google.

You can install it just as any other apk WesleySmalls "Will it be neglected to Internet-of-Things devices and other basic hardware, or will it some day replace Android altogether?" Neither, this is just a side project many developers use to test and work out the feasability of a variety of things. Android is a very well developed environment, and replacing it whole is simply a no-go. Things will just gradually evolve, as they have already done with Dalvik being replaced by ART, for example. Sir_Brizz I don't think you're wrong, but it would be in Google's best interest to start building a non-JVM runtime that apps can run inside with a native language that Google has 100% full control over like Go or Dart. Тарас Мукин 1. This is definetelly Chat UI! It came from Telegram bots and whatsoever, and it is so smart of Google to be developing it now. Feels like it's going to be next big UI-change after Apple came up with apps divided into screens. 2. "Magenta is designed for ... non-trivial amounts of ram" This is going to be optimised sooo bad.

Nicolas Bahamondes Fuchsia Police... Alvin My money is on this turning into a really useful and innovative messaging app. Oh, with stickers. Superman Not happening, just like module phone. Lol Cyber Jethro I personally think this is for embedded systems like shopping kiosks or other customer service applications. Zach Mauch "Will it be neglected to Internet-of-Things devices and other basic hardware" Did you mean "relegated", not "neglected"? PVL_93_RU Those "stories" on the "home screen" look like they'd fit perfectly for a kiosk-type display, where you have a lot of space to work with JG Fuchsia is a purple-y pink color. T-Mobile's color is Magenta, a slightly different purple-y pink color T-Mobile is rumored to be looking into launching their own phone... Coincidence??? Almost certainly, without a doubt yes... But consider... T-Mobile also launched the first Android phone... yoloswag Inspired by the messaging team, Google wants to start working on a 2nd operating system. JG Magenta is designed for "modern phones and modern personal computers with fast processors, non-trivial amounts of ram with arbitrary peripherals doing open ended computation." Modern personal computers huh? I've been interested in Google packing ChromeOS into a LiveCD type set up we could test/install on our own computers... (*Yes, I know of Chromium, haven't tried it yet... But I would prefer it coming direct from Google, faster updates and all that). It could be interesting to try out another of Google's OSs without having to fork over several hundred for new hardware... The only problem would be drivers to support the various hardware. If not modified too much, ChromeOS could possibly use the original Gentoo Linux drivers. But with Fuchsia using its own unique kernel... That might throw things off a bit... I know a few less tech-savey individuals who would probably be more comfortable if the same OS powered their phone, tablet and desktop (should Google opt to replace Android with Fuchsia). Especially if it could run both Android apps and Chrome extensions natively. Zxyon Rhysivz This could be the beginning of distros for Android. *Imagines Ubuntu Android* Peter World Citizen This will run in parallel with Android.

		     Privacy Policy Thank you Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. Credit: Michael Horowitz/IDG More like this How seven mesh routers deal with Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS) Getting started with the Ubiquiti AmpliFi mesh router Asus router warnings on privacy and security Video Highlights from Interop 2015 Many of the new mesh router systems self-update their firmware (router operating system). While this is a big step forward from the bad old days, where the task fell to the router owner, it's only a first step. On my Router Security site, I go into the difference between self-updating firmware done right and done wrong. With that in mind, here is what went wrong when my Google Wifi router updated its firmware.  Scheduling My first gripe is that the software update was a surprise. There was no warning ahead of time, either that an update was available, or that it was about to be installed. In contrast, the Eero app tells you that a firmware update is available well before the update is automatically installed. The screen shot below shows the Google iOS app informing me after the fact that it had updated the router software (the screen shot was taken May 6th). Michael Horowitz/IDG Google Wifi iOS app notification of firmware update This is made worse by the fact that I explicitly asked to be notified. The screen shot below, of the Google Wifi iOS app, (version 2.2.8) shows that I had opted in to all their email notices. I should be notified about updates, new features and product announcements. Yet, when push came to shove, no email. Michael Horowitz/IDG Configuring email preferences in the Google Wifi iOS app Then there is the timing. The software update was installed at 5:55PM. Since Google does not offer the router owner a choice as to when the update happens, they should default to running the update in the middle of the night. 5:55PM seems like a really bad default time of day. Others have griped about this too; one complaint was that "Google Wifi just rebooted in the middle of my workday while on a VoIP call." Shades of Windows 10. The iOS app is also buggy. More than two days after the firmware update, the app reported that the router was running version 9202.35.8, released back in March. It wasn't until later in the day, that the app correctly reported that the software was version 9334.41.3. Documentation What's new in this firmware release? None of your business. The link in the app to "MORE DETAILS" (at the bottom of the first screen shot above) is a scam. There are no more details, just a generic list of tech support articles. The two sentences in this screen shot are the only available documentation. Three days after the router was updated, I could not find any documentation on the web. At support.google.com, I searched for "9334.41.3" and the only result was an article about the prior version of the software. The search picked up that page because it has an index of related pages that included this one: Google Wifi & OnHub Software Version 9334.41.3. But that page is not firmware documentation, it merely details open source licenses. Taking a step back, searching for firmware documentation should not be necessary. Every router vendor should have a single web page with a firmware update history that we can bookmark. For Eero routers, the page eero Software Release Notes is exactly this. At the main product page for the Netgear Orbi RBK50, if you click on Firmware and Software Downloads, then on View Previous Versions, you can see the firmware history. My final gripe is about one of the two sentences that serves as release notes. That the update contains "General stability and performance improvements" is, frankly, insulting. In fairness, this seems to be an industry norm. The last three firmware releases for Eero all contained "Various bug fixes and reliability improvements." Netgear does the same; each of the last three Orbi firmware releases "Fixes bugs and security issues." These mesh router systems are consumer devices and that seems to imply that the customer has no right to know what's going on. Maybe these companies don't think their customers care. Maybe they don't think their customers can understand technical issues. Maybe the companies are just lazy. Maybe they don't want to air their dirty laundry in public.  Their refusing to come clean about bugs stands in stark contrast with the behavior of Peplink, my preferred router vendor. Take, for example, the release notes for version 6.3.3 of the firmware for my favorite router, their Surf SOHO.  Version 6.3.3 was the end of the line for version 6, and, as such, it was mostly a bug fix release. The Resolved Issues section lists seven fixed bugs, each of which has a tracking number. The Known Issues section documents problems that are not yet fixed. No one expects software to be perfect. Peplink comes clean and that's the best way to earn trust. From a Defensive Computing perspective, trust matters more than Wi-Fi speed and range.  Feedback Get in touch with me privately by email at my full name at Gmail.

Apple: Home game grudge match Apple is teaching Siri to learn new tricks Video Mingis on Tech: Energy microgrids, what's up with Apple TV -- and drones! The name “iPhone” is part of the public lexicon, as common as Kleenex and Google. Yet, there might come a day when that iconic brand name starts to seem outdated. If rumors about an Apple Siri speaker are true, the day could come sooner than any of us expect. As a speaker, this device will play music but also talk to you, similar to what you can do with the Amazon Echo or Google Home speakers. It means you don’t need to fish out your phone to check the score of an NBA Playoffs game or get a weather report. You just ask by voice. However, if the speaker could replace your phone, it will need to offer much more than just a few basic voice-activated features. (It’s also worth noting that we’ll also need one at home, in the office, the car, and everywhere in between. And, there will be many times when we still want a phone to play games, text with family, and tap up emails on a plane. Also, a few die-hards will probably not give up their phone anytime soon no matter what.) Smart speakers could handle home control functions, tell you about appointments, fetch an Uber when the A.I. realizes you have a meeting across town. Siri runs on the iPhone now, but your phone is not always around or charged up. Interestingly, the rumors suggest that Apple may introduce the speaker next month at WWDC and, unlike the Echo, will have a screen -- which means it could also handle Skype calls and let you view photos form your last vacation. It also better do these things: 1. Make easy phone calls We call them smartphones, but I know a few millennials who don’t ever make calls. They text all day, and when they do place a phone call, it’s maybe once per week. In the living room, if you could make a quick call, it would save time. “Hey Siri, find an appliance repairman and make the call,” would be much faster than using Google Chrome or scrolling through contacts. Today, that doesn’t really work on an iPhone, so the speaker would have to use added intelligence to parse out what you want to do. 2. Engage in real dialog Siri is pretty dumb, actually. The voicebot doesn’t really engage with you, and the best bot we have for dialog is the Assistant on Google Home. You can ask a question like “Who is Steph Curry?” and then say “When was he born?” and that works. It doesn’t work with Echo or Siri today. Apple could go much further with the speaker and let it converse with you about a wide range of topics; that's important since the speaker will become such an important part of your day (and your morning and your evening). 3. Summarize my email Siri lets you dictate a text message pretty easily, but I’m not as interested in that. What I really want it to do is summarize my texts and emails, and then I'll keep typing emails on my laptop. The bot should know which ones are important, based on my frequent interactions and machine learning. For example, the boss needs me to call her right now. I’d like Siri to be able to let me know when that happens. And, the bot could tell me a quick synopsis of less important emails, set reminders, and ignore email fluff.

Waterloo, Ontario based-OpenText updated R16, its integrated digital information management platform, with a new Enhancement Pack 2 (EP2), which is designed to improve the flow of information between different customer touchpoints to the company’s entire software portfolio and ecosystem. One of R16’s strong points has always been the management of business process workflows. This release aims to make the digitization of those workflows easier as well as simplifying the entire digitization process through an enhanced interface. In a statement, the company indicated the focus of this release was on cloud optimization, mobility, smart UI, automation, flexibility, self-service and creative collaboration. Digging Deeper Into the Data That’s quite a mouthful for a single upgrade, but with disruptive technologies like the Internet of Things now gaining traction in the enterprises, OpenText, like many other information and content management vendors, has been forced to react quickly to the changing market. By focusing on digging deep and surfacing insights from the data — both structured and unstructured — stored in enterprise repositories the company is looking to cater to CEOs concerned with their digital transformation strategies turning a profit. EP2 includes improvements for the Experience, Process, Content and Discovery suites as well as improvements to the new business network. Clearly, we can expect more from OpenText, especially with the Documentum deal now finalized and all the integrations and developments ahead.  The company is scheduled to release its quarterly earnings later today, with expectations running high for a big jump in sales — with some predicting revenues of $600 million, as opposed to $440 million for the same period last year.  Google Gets Phished You can’t say you haven’t been warned.  We discuss security in this column on a regular basis and last week showed why. Google and its productivity suite, specifically Google Docs, was in the spotlight as a series of phishing emails went out using the service. The Mountain View, Calif.-based company claimed it has stopped it, but where there’s one attack there’s likely to be others. According to the company, the phishing emails affected about one million customers. The attack came in the form of a permissions request for a Google document sent through Gmail from a person in the user's contact list.   Those who followed the prompts gave the attackers access to their contact list, setting off a new round of emails to the targeted user’s contacts. Given the subtlety of the attack, it is surprising that it didn’t spread any further. However, Gmail and contact lists are two of Google’s crown jewels and the company kicked into security mode quickly enough to limit the damage and prevent any personal details from being exposed. Apart from the annoyance, the attack was on the surface rather pointless and ineffective. However, the fundamental problem is not going away and could be a lot more serious. Specialized hacking groups often use fake login pages to crack accounts and there’s no easy way to stop them. Combined with the problem of dummy apps on the Google Play Store — apps that are disguised to look like something useful to entice users to download them — there's a potentially serious enterprise breach in the making.  At a time when Google is competing with Microsoft and its Office 365 suite, its reputation is at stake to prevent future attacks from going further.  IntelliChief Continues Paperless Drive Meanwhile, document management and workflow vendor IntelliChief updated ECM Workbench, enabling automated document management. Tampa, Fla.-based IntelliChief launched workbench along with its ECM 4.0, which introduced new document management automation as well as several new capabilities to enhance productivity and user experience in the ECM. Among the new capabilities Workbench includes are a new user interface that enables automatic information capture and indexing from any data source.  IntelliChief is one of the pioneers of the "paperless office" movement. Since its founding in 2005 it has offered paperless process management and workflow solutions for IT platforms. It also provides seamless integration with many enterprise resource planning systems, and claims it can deliver companies of all sizes ROI within less than one year. Portal and Withum Announce New Partnership Portal Solutions, an information technology consulting firm based in Bethesda, Md. announced it has joined its practice with Princeton, NJ-based Withum Smith+Brown, PC, a regional certified public accountant and consulting firm. Portal Solutions will join Withum as a partner and continue to lead its growing advisory practice. Founded in 2003, Portal Solutions focuses on developing digital transformation strategies and designing digital workplaces for enterprises. The partnership has the potential to make both companies major players in the space. In a blog about the new partnership, Daniel Cohen-Dumani, founder and CEO of Portal Solutions, wrote that by partnering with Withum, Portal would be able to expand its reach and portfolio of products. “Withum’s considerable resources will accelerate our expansion in Data and Analytics solutions, Mobile Development, Security and Risk assessment, Managed Services, and Modern Business Applications with Microsoft Dynamics 365,” he wrote. “It will also allow us to further expand our overall solution capabilities to offer packaged solutions, such as OneWindow Workplace intranet, in industries such as healthcare, professional services, non-profits, real estate, financial services and others — locally, nationally and internationally." Withum’s Managing Partner and CEO Bill Hagaman, CPA, CGMA, also noted that Withum has been seeking the right strategic partner to enhance its management consulting services “Our union will allow us to immediately offer our clients cloud-focused information technology consulting services supporting Office 365, Azure cloud solutions, data analytics, business process automation and mobile development and security. It’s very exciting,” he said in a statement. 0 Comments Top Articles Related Articles Recent Comments How Information Architecture Improves Customer Experience Jive Software Acquired by ESW Capital for $462M Kofax Is for Sale: Will Hyland or Thoma Bravo Be the New Owners?

At least eight civilians were killed on both sides in fighting that began when a Pakistani census team accompanied by soldiers visited disputed villages along the southern border on Friday. Pakistan inherited its 2,400-kilometre (1,500-mile) border with its western neighbour when it gained independence from Britain in 1947, but Afghanistan has never formally recognised it. And while official Afghan maps reflect the so-called "Durand Line", many nationalists believe the true border of their country ends at the River Indus that runs though Pakistan and gave India its name. "Officials from the geological survey departments of the two countries will conduct a survey, and they will also make use of Google Maps," said a senior Pakistani security source in Islamabad who requested anonymity. Abdul Razeq, the police chief of Afghanistan's Kandahar province, added: "After negotiations, both sides have agreed that a geological survey should be conducted. "Technical teams of both countries will use GPS and Google Maps as well as other means to get the answer." Internet firm Google complies with local laws in certain countries that compel it to show borders in line with national demands. For instance, its Indian site shows the entirety of disputed Kashmir as controlled by India. In Pakistan, however, the site shows the internationally recognised de facto border, the Line of Control, marked with a dotted line to denote it is disputed. In 2010 Google was embroiled in a Central American border dispute that saw two neighbouring countries dispatch troops and heavily armed police to their joint border. The incident happened after a Nicaraguan commander cited Google's version of the border map in an interview with Costa Rican newspaper La Nacion to justify a raid on a disputed area of Costa Rica. Google later said it had made a mistake and corrected its map to reflect one sanctioned by the US State Department. Pakistan last year began trying to harden the traditionally soft border with Afghanistan through trenching and fencing, but its efforts were met with hostility from Kabul. Ethnic Pashtuns living in the region have traditionally paid it little heed. Villages straddling the frontier have mosques and houses with one door in Pakistan and another in Afghanistan. Pakistani forces yesterday elevated their rhetoric when they said they had also killed "more than 50 soldiers" in last week's border clashes - a claim quickly rejected by Kabul, which said it lost two soldiers.

"Technical teams of both countries will use GPS and Google Maps as well as other means to get the answer." Internet firm Google complies with local laws in certain countries that compel it to show borders in line with national demands. For instance, its Indian site shows the entirety of disputed Kashmir as controlled by India. In Pakistan, however, the site shows the internationally recognised de facto border, the Line of Control, marked with a dotted line to denote it is disputed. In 2010 Google was embroiled in a Central American border dispute that saw two neighbouring countries dispatch troops and heavily armed police to their joint border. The incident happened after a Nicaraguan commander cited Google's version of the border map in an interview with Costa Rican newspaper La Nacion to justify a raid on a disputed area of Costa Rica. Google later said it had made a mistake and corrected its map to reflect one sanctioned by the US State Department. Pakistan last year began trying to harden the traditionally soft border with Afghanistan through trenching and fencing, but its efforts were met with hostility from Kabul. Ethnic Pashtuns living in the region have traditionally paid it little heed. Villages straddling the frontier have mosques and houses with one door in Pakistan and another in Afghanistan. Pakistani forces yesterday elevated their rhetoric when they said they had also killed "more than 50 soldiers" in last week's border clashes - a claim quickly rejected by Kabul, which said it lost two soldiers.

Now, Google says a full beta test of Android O will begin soon, and that means the Android Nougat beta is now closed. The current build of Android O (which has neither a name nor a version number) is an early alpha of the platform. The only way to install it is to connect your eligible phone to a PC and use the Android SDK tools to flash the system image. It’s not terribly difficult if you’re familiar with Android, but it’s not the sort of thing average consumers should be attempting. In order to flash these images, you need to have a recent Nexus device or a Pixel. Additionally, the bootloader must be unlocked, which again requires a little setup with the SDK tools. Google says the Android O beta is “coming soon” when you visit the Android beta program page. This is the preferred way to test upcoming versions of Android; the betas are usually more stable and they’re vastly easier to install. After signing in, you can choose which of your eligible devices (still just Nexus and Pixel) you’d like to enroll. Beta program updates are delivered to your phone or tablet as an OTA update, so the boot loader can remain locked. While Google did not provide a specific date for the launch of the Android O beta, it’s likely it will open up registrations next week during Google I/O. The company is expected to talk more about the upcoming version of Android in detail, and developers at the event will be able to learn more about how Android O will affect their apps. Some big changes are coming in Android O, too. In Android O, Google is clamping down on what apps can do in the background. This is part of a trend that started in Marshmallow with Doze Mode, a way of putting apps to sleep while the device is idle. In Android O, apps will be limited in how often they can run actions from the background and request system information like location. This should allow for better battery life, but developers might need to modify the behavior of their apps. Android O will also include support for system-wide auto-fill apps and notification channels for more granular control of interruptions. Developers need to know how to work within these restrictions in advance of Android O’s release. If you’ve got a supported device and an adventurous spirit, keep an eye on the Android Beta page next week. Google I/O runs from May 17-19th.

Google's "Fuchsia" operating system is taking shape with a new design Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/08 10:01am PDTMay 8, 2017 29 Plus 1 on G+ 243 Share on Facebook 78 Share on Twitter Total Shares350 Development Google News We first talked about Fuchsia, a new operating system being developed at Google, back in August (in fact, it was my first post here). At the time, there wasn't much to get excited about besides the potential - it only had a command-line interface. Now the project has a snazzy new, but clearly unfinished, interface. Summary of Fuchsia First, it's worth going over exactly what Fuchsia is, because it's been quite a while since we talked about it. As opposed to all of Google's other OSes, such as Android and Chrome OS, Fuchsia uses the company's new 'Magenta' kernel instead of Linux. According to the project's documentation, Magenta is designed for "modern phones and modern personal computers with fast processors, non-trivial amounts of ram with arbitrary peripherals doing open ended computation." Magenta's apps and the system interface are written with Google's Flutter SDK, which was initially designed to create cross-platform apps for iOS and Android. Flutter applications are written in Dart, the company's home-grown programming language. All of the system and apps are rendered by 'Escher,' which uses OpenGL or Vulkan to display everything. The 'Armadillo' interface So, on to the new stuff. Fuchsia's system UI has a new name - 'Armadillo.' Ars Technica was able to compile Armadillo into an Android APK, since it is written with the above-mentioned Flutter SDK. The interface doesn't really do anything besides looking pretty, but it does give us an idea of what the finished product could look like. The home screen is a vertical list, with a profile picture, the time, and a battery indicator in the center. Tapping the profile picture brings up something similar to Android's Quick Settings, with toggles for auto-rotate, do not disturb, Airplane Mode, and so on. Above the profile picture is the 'Story,' which the documentation describes as "a set of apps and/or modules that work together for the user to achieve a goal." Currently, this works similarly to Android's Recents screen. Users will also be able to combine stories into a 'Story Cluster.' This is what dragging a Story card into split-screen looks like. Dragging a Story card onto another one triggers a split-screen mode. The user can split an app 50/50 vertically or horizontally, drag in another app for a 33/33/33 split, or even have a tab bar appear for using all the open apps in full-screen. You can even have two apps split vertically next to two other split apps, seen below. This is far more flexible than Android's current multi-tasking functionality, but whether or not it will stay this way is uncertain. Below the profile picture is a panel resembling Google Now, with a placeholder search bar and suggestion cards. Armadillo's documentation says, "a suggestion is a representation of an action the user can take to augment an existing story or to start a new one. [The] suggestion contains enough information to create the visual representation of that concept." So maybe they will work more like an app launcher? It's hard to tell at this point. The Google Now panel, showing Fuchsia's keyboard. Keep in mind that all of this is subject to change, as the Armadillo interface (and the rest of Fuchsia OS) is still under heavy development. It's also hard to tell what Google's plans are for the operating system. Will it be neglected to Internet-of-Things devices and other basic hardware, or will it some day replace Android altogether? We'll have to wait and see.

Suicide_Note Because Google can. Corbin Davenport Ron from Ars Technica put it best: "Fuchsia really seems like a project that asks 'how would we design Android today, if we could start over?' It's a brand-new, Google-developed kernel running a brand-new, Google-developed SDK that uses a brand-new, Google-developed programming language and it's all geared to run Google's Material Design interface as quickly as possible. Google gets to dump Linux and the GPL, it can dump Java and the problems it caused with Oracle, and Google can basically insulate itself from all of Android's upstream projects and bring all the development in-house. Doing such a thing on the scale of Android today would be a massive project." makapav Would it still be open source? Also, what would happen to all the existing APKs? Corbin Davenport Fuchisa is completely open source right now. As for running Android apps, maybe Google will add some kind of stop-gap compatibility layer for running Android apps, like Chrome OS has. destinyhud read the article Suicide_Note Perhaps instead of replacing Android, this will *become* Android, as in Android P or Q? Or be the merger of Android/Chrome? m477 I could see that as Android 10. Definitely too early for P. morteum I wonder if the reason it is called "Armadillo" is because they're starting from A again, but this time they're using animals instead of desserts. Christopher Bement I think it's a smart plan, based on the guess that there's more animals to pick from in the world than tasty desserts. teolinux Ubuntu docet Paul "Tasty treats," not necessarily desserts. That said, armadillos could be a tasty treat. I won't judge. MJ I have heard desserts and candy used before which are wrong but "tasty treats" is a new one for me. To be more accurate, Android names are actually all confectionery foods. A "tasty treat" could be a slice of pizza (aka Android S). LOL Randy Gindy Armadillo is the name of the UI not the OS build itself. Matt74UK Smooth on the inside, crunchy on the outside. Armadillo ! (a few UK people of a certain age may get that). John Doe Idk this is a whole new OS with a new kernel, I doubt this will be done with an OTA update for Android. Mantas Pakėnas Even nowadays, some of Android's new functionality cannot be done via OTA updates (like dual system partitions, forced encryption I believe, etc). To make a completely hard cut sometime when this is ready, and if it's meant to replace Android, is not completely unimaginable. As is updating via OTA. If apple was able to change their file system via OTA, I don't see why changing most of the parts would not be possible. However, nobody aside from Google would do it, almost guaranteed :) Suicide_Note It could likely be done for Pixel devices, and possibly for future devices released after this new version of the OS rolls out. Adrian Meredith quite possibly, after all there no reason it couldn't also run android apps jonathan What they need to do is make this googles very own os for their pixel line and leave android for the oems Suicide_Note Not a chance. To much name recognition with Android for Google to drop it in favor of something else specific to the Pixel lineup. Dallas King Android Z confirmed! Suicide_Note More like Android A for Armadillo. m477 APK plz (no, really, I want a compiled apk the demo) Maxwell “Max” Weinbach https://github.com/fuchsia-mirror/sysui MJ Your link wasn't what the OP asked for... Maxwell “Max” Weinbach the only way to get the APK is to compile it yourself, so I linked to the Github page to a place to download the files to compile. The closest they will get. MJ Than you should have replied there is no known APK or not at all. Maxwell “Max” Weinbach It does not matter that much. I am building the APK right now. Once it is done I will post it. Here is the link on how to compile it. http://www.hotfixit.net/single-post/2017/05/03/How-to-build-Armadillo MJ Don't waste your time... They updated that article with an download of the APK. Maxwell “Max” Weinbach thanks. they just did that. I still compiled it myself though. I will try to get more out of it while I have the Sysui downloaded. Michel R. https://www.androidfilehost.com/?w=files&flid=178684 there you go MJ http://www.hotfixit.net/single-post/2017/05/03/How-to-build-Armadillo Latex beats nudity More of Proprietary code ? No thank you, we already had enough with this Pixel crud. I hope this OS dies quicker or become a chromebook OS. m477 It's open source. Latex beats nudity It's OSS but just like Android It'll be more heavily dependent on the google APIs to make it work. Look at the Pixel SysUI, Just being OSS doesn't make it open source... It's Google's OS not a Linux Based one. If this is going to replace Android It's doomsday on multiple levels. destinyhud billions of people dont care if its running linux kernel or not. maybe very few like u might. do iphone users care why kernel it runs. none of them care. u r just noise tbh Latex beats nudity Billions of people don't code. You are being a kool-aid joke tbh. destinyhud exaclt only few code and even on that few many dont care if it runs linux or not. look at iphone there are more dev there and yet they dont care for kernel. u r delusional in ur own world m477 Android it's already been on a Google-dependent road for years. I don't think this is going to change either way. An Angry Chihuahua https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/magenta/+/master/docs/getting_started.md heres the source code. do some research my dude WitnessG Imagining this running on a Google made processor is exciting. Badouken If this was the OS for the Pixel 2 alongside a Google made processor I think id cry! WitnessG Yeah I don't see this coming out for at least another 2-3 years. Badouken Indeed, but we can dream! ha Suicide_Note Maybe the Pixel 3 or 4 will see the dream become reality. Suicide_Note I'm betting this is what we'll see in a couple years time. As another commenter stated, starting with Armadillo could be Google's way of starting from the beginning (letter A codename), since there's more animal babes to use for each letter than there are dessert names to use. Timothy Vreeland You are getting the furries excited. Nomaan Armadillo should be compared to holo/material and not to dessert names. nachofrand What makes you think Google would be good at making SoCs? They're a software company and don't have the hardware expertise for hardcore ASIC development like that. Granted they can hire people, but in the end, does it matter? They're going to use ARM either way. UnlikeABoss Google fanboyism. The same reason he's excited over a brand new OS. He knows absolutely nothing about it, short of the fact that it will create more fragmentation not only in the OS space, but also the kernel space. So all we know are negative things so far. This is what we call exciting now is it? Why? Just because Google is doing it? If Microsoft made this exact same announcement, would we all be excited? Oh dear. Zsolt V No, because essentially everybody loathes Microsoft. Almost nobody's life would be worse if Microsoft vanished. marcusmarcus2 Don't they design and build their own servers to use for all their websites? Seems like those hardware work well for them. Sergii Pylypenko It's one thing to assemble the server using off-the-shelf components, or even to order a custom motherboard. It's a very different thing to design and manufacture your own chips. marcusmarcus2 I'm not saying it is the same, just that they are not only software experts. Them designing and building the servers show they do have hardware expertise that could assist them in doing the same to chips. Zsolt V Except Google's servers are not assembled from off the shelf components. Haven't been for a few years now. Roy What about TPU? Adrian Vovk Samsung Exynos devices are faster than Snapdragon, iPhones seem underpowered but are extremely snappy, etc. The point is that making both the software and hardware leads to a very fast ecosystem. Also, Google are making the TPU for neural networks nachofrand Yes, as expected. Exynos is faster than Snapdragon on the Galaxy phones, but put an Exynos in another phone...oh wait, you can't. That's the whole entire point. Snapdragon SoCs are general purpose SoCs and can be used for a multitude of phones so they're not custom tuned to every phone individually. Exynos have very specific power rails and the chip is made specifically for that phone. The thing is, sure this is better, but it's marginal and hardly worth talking about. They both use the same ARM architecture so performance gains are pretty negligible. Besides that, this is how Samsung makes money....off of device sales. Google doesn't make money that way. That isn't their business model so at this point it doesn't make sense for them to build their own SoCs when they could just work closer with hardware companies. They make their own TPUs because it aligns with their business model. Adrian Vovk The instruction set doesn't really matter? I can have a 6700k and a 6500k and the 6700k will perform much better even though they are both amd64. With what Google is doing with the Pixels (still as snappy as day one here) I'm pretty sure they can optimize it further than Samsung does. They have made it run smoother in some cases on a chip that they didn't manufacture. If they made their own chip it would allow them many freedoms that they otherwise don't have = easier design of the device. I brought up the TPUs because that is experience in chip manufacturing Jason What makes you say iPhones are under powered ? Apples chips are some of the fastest around and are extremely powerful. Adrian Vovk Specs wise. They have much worse specs on paper and it would lead to a slower experience, except Apple can optimize it because they make both the chip and the OS Stephen Sharp They could use Risc-V and have to pay to license absolutely nothing, while being able to make processors purpose built for their OS Randy Gindy That would be an interesting move. Stephen Sharp Indeed, I really want Risc-V to succeed as an open ISA nachofrand They could. But in my opinion, it's unlikely. Google isn't trying to compete with Samsung and Apple in device sales and that isn't their business model. People using their services so they can show ads is their business model. It doesn't make sense for Google to make their own SoC when others are already doing a good job. Plus, if they went to RISC-V then what? What about the modem? They have to buy a standalone modem from Qualcomm or Intel. Now you have to hire system integration and test engineers to make sure the modem is working with your SoC. Oh and then you need a whole firmware team to control the modem. At that point, buy a full blown SoC with the modem on chip. Stephen Sharp Eh you lost me at "Pixel phone" and all the other hardware they sell. Google also is a Platinum member of the Risc-V foundation, and if there is a direction they are going, more control or less control, I would guess it's "more". But that's just a guess nachofrand Hardware isn't even close to the same thing as asic development. IC design is a different world. Granted they do some custom hardware, but SoCs are a much much larger feat. It's still a possibility they do so, but it doesn't make sense with their current business model imo. Captain On! 1 - Google has stated that they're going to make their own silicon for the Pixels in time. 2 - Google actually owns/operates the world's most powerful quantum computer. They know how to make chips. Randy Gindy That quantum computer was built by DWave though Angel I read (somewhere don’t remember) that they have three different quantum computers systems. One from DWave and two home-produced. From those two, one was made by engineers and not that disimilar from DWave in its operations. The other was made by physicists and uses a different approach. nachofrand 1. I could be wrong, but I've only read that they plan on working closer with chip manufacturers. 2. Google didn't make that computer. Even if they did, quantum is so different those skills don't even translate. Romario Maxwell Google made their own custom ASIC called the Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) for their AI/Machine Learning needs on their cloud platform. See https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2016/05/Google-supercharges-machine-learning-tasks-with-custom-chip.html and https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2017/04/quantifying-the-performance-of-the-TPU-our-first-machine-learning-chip.html nachofrand Sure, although a TPU is just an accelerator. Think of it as the hexagon DSP inside of the Snapdragon SoC. That's like 1/10 of the entire chip. SoC design is much larger. Timothy Vreeland How many examples of hardware design do people have to point out before you stop? Sure the hardware they worked on previously isn't exactly the same... But before they started the hardware they are currently working on, they worked on previous hardware that wasn't the same as what they are doing now. They have shown they are competent in designing many kinds of hardware. Or do you suggest a company can only build one kind of hardware and nothing else for all eternity? How did Samsung make it's current in-house chips? Did they go to ARM college? Have they been making ARM chips since the dawn of time? No. They put together some teams and got to work, so stop blabbing and being negative. sweenish Their AI that finally beat the world's top Go players was running on custom Google chips. It's not like they don't know how. Pixelexel Imagine a Google Pixel with a Google made processor, with Fuschia, with Project Fi with Google WiFi powered by Google fiber. If I'd have this, my life would be complete. Iamsecond Ha, no. A Google processor? Supported for 18 months, then replaced with a new processor that performs half as well (but has stickers.) Does not fully process Android code, because at Google one hand doesn't even know the other hand is there, let alone talk to it. Has 20 cores (only 2 enabled outside US for 'reasons.') Has a dedicated co-processor to enable ads in every app, even those that previously didn't have them. Jason Google can't even get a phone out the door without issues and you want them to make the chips too...lol. I'll pass. UnlikeABoss "In house kernel instead of Linux". Yeah, hopefully this dies in a thousand pits of fire. "Hey Linux guys, you know how you've helped us make billions over the years with a free open source kernel? Well, we were just using you to get the "nerd" userbase. Now we own the market thanks to you guys promoting its use of Linux, we will gradually phase you out." .... m477 I hope not. Linux is not really a kernel made with smartphone in minds. I don't care for being a fan of a kernel over another. UnlikeABoss Yeah. I'd much rather use a brand new untested kernel (and all the teething issues that will come with it) in my smartphone than a mature, stable one that's hacked on by hundreds and thousands of people every month. I mean, it's just a smartphone, we don't need it to be a secure environment, right? Let's just make a nice obscure kernel that no one else will use, and just say "but but it's open source!!! love us because we are Google kk". ... ihsan ışık I'm sorry but it just looks like you are a huge Linux fan and are just against change to me. UnlikeABoss Looks can be deceiving. If you're going to fling around the Linux fanboy term, i'll fling around the Google fanboy term, and that will surely be a nice constructive argument that we will both want to continue. m477 So, in 10 years we should still be using an unoptimised kernel like Linux, because anything newer is, well, newer? UnlikeABoss Yeah, because Linux hasn't changed at all in 10 years... m477 Yes, it changed a lot, and it still has many of the same problems, which are intrinsically bound to its structure. It's not a kernel well suited for mobile devices. UnlikeABoss You think the solution is to throw it out the window and start from scratch? I disagree. I'd much rather continue improving the Linux kernel, simply because of all the eyes it will always have on its code. jonathan Play nice ladies lol m477 With this mentality we wouldn't have Linux at all. Why start anything, while we can continue this other thing which purpose was completely different? A mircokenel is more well suited than a monolitic kernel to a mobile devices, both in terms of performance and security. No matter how much you improve Linux, it will never be a microkernel. UnlikeABoss Smartphones don't need a micro kernel in 2017. You could make that argument 7 years ago. Linux can be compiled with the required drivers just like it always could. m477 I made that argument 7 years ago. They always needed something different from Linux. The fact that specific, even proprietary drivers have to be integrated in the kernel (since Android lacks an abstraction layer) is on of the problems of the interaction Android-Linux. destinyhud why havent the nerds made linux on pc's a bigger market share if they were the one who made android a global leader UnlikeABoss No nerd is promoting Linux on the desktop. All social media used to be full of people promoting Android over iOS, these days there's no need to. destinyhud why havent they promoted desktop?? just wondering why they did for android but not for desktop.. linux on desktop was an underdog for decades. android was not popular because of kernal. android became popular because it was opensource and was the only viable competition to ios. people dont care what kernel it runs. UnlikeABoss No nerd worth their salt would promote an environment that would be a downgrade from Windows. Android was not a downgrade from iOS at any point in time, it had a very equal playing field. There's a difference between promoting a good solid FOSS kernel where possible, and promoting an agenda. m477 Android was not a downgrade from iOS at any point in time By this, I get that you never used Android and iOS side by side in 2009-10. UnlikeABoss You clearly value different things. The hackability alone made it an upgrade through its lifetime. m477 The same can be said for GNU/Linux on desktop. UnlikeABoss No it can't, because hackability =/= app availability. i.e. The hackability on Linux desktop doesn't make it win over it's lack of apps, where that isn't an issue on Android. m477 App availability was horrible in the early days, compared to iOS. Even Symbian had more apps. UnlikeABoss That was fine since the early days didn't consist of using your smartphone for very much, due to under powered hardware. Techies didn't go around saying "use iOS because we can all take selfies and stick filters on it". m477 iOS devices didn't have front cameras until mid 2010. The system was better, faster, smoother, the interface was coesive, there were many more apps, and the jailbreak community, to address the techie audience you like to go on about so much, was very, very good. There were tweaks and modifications that even the wildest Android custom ROM didn't have at the time. Android was objectively a downgrade, as much as Linux was on desktop. UnlikeABoss Calling jailbraik an advantage over a FOSS OS is pretty hilarious. iOS wasn't popular because it was better, it was popular because of the amount of people getting their advice from paid employees in store. "Buy iOS so we get a commission". m477 iPhone was more popular for various reasons: marketing, having 2 years of advantage, and, yes, more marketing. But it was also better than Android, as an OS. What benefit did Android bring, with it being opensource, compared to iOS, even to a "techie"? The dev community was laughable in the early days. Why GNU/Linux on desktop was not promoted by "techies" (which is false) and Android was, even if their shortcomings were identical? destinyhud u live in a dream world. even most dev dont care about kernel. what they care about the dev platform. I am a dev and i dont care for the kernel UnlikeABoss If you're talking from the perspective of an app developer then ofcourse you don't care about the kernel, you care about which platform will make you the most money... destinyhud exactly. no one care what kernel it runs.. all dev care is what platform make money. so who is this nerd who care about kernel if most dont care about the kernel.. yeah very very few.. infact rare like u UnlikeABoss Techie == Technology Enthusiast. You can sit here and tell me that you would use the best dev environment all you want but the truth is if the iOS dev environment was awful you'd still suck it up and use it to make your money. I'm not sure how you can class yourself as an enthusiast at that point. destinyhud ever wonder why no one is up voting u and upvoting many of my comments? because what u say is BS. its that simple. I am up for ditching outdated linux if the new kernal is modern and build for modern devices. most dont care for this very few techies.. i hope this becomes true and linux kernel die.. UnlikeABoss "Ever wonder why Google fanboys upvote pro Google content and not anti-Google content?" No, no I don't wonder that. How dare someone critique a pointless change by Google, causing unnecessary fragmentation. Burn them! destinyhud u must be new here.. look at anti google comments here when they make stupid changes but if they make welcome changes people tend to agree UnlikeABoss No, I've been here a long time and made many anti-Google comments as well as pro-Google. No one in the right mind would cheer on kernel fragmentation other than those that think Google can do no wrong. destinyhud open up ur comments history and let me see if u made pro google comments. i have a feeling u r a troll UnlikeABoss Yeah, this discussion is going no where. You are not the authority here and the idea that you want to browse my history to make sure I fall in line is creepy as hell. Bye. destinyhud lol i see u dont want to open ur comments history. obvious troll m477 outdated linux i hope this becomes true and linux kernel die Woah, wait a second here. Linux is not outdated, and its death would be terrible for everyone. It's just that it's not the most apt kernel for a mobile device. destinyhud maybe not outdated but not the right fit for mobile devices. destinyhud android sucked when compared to ios.. it was a downgrade compared to ios. why did dev promote android and not desktop linux? u reasoning dont even make sense. UnlikeABoss No, it wasn't a downgrade. destinyhud yes, it was back in android initial release. iOS was better and much more polished at that time. but things changed now. UnlikeABoss "Polished" is not a factor that is used to judge a better OS. There are Linux environments that are much more polished than Windows 10, but that doesn't make desktop Linux better. destinyhud it was both polished and runs better than android at that time. polished was not the only one. it was also polished. android only got better later.. i have used android at that time and it sucked big time. UnlikeABoss You are using today's standards to judge it. If you do that, they both sucked. It worked perfectly fine for the basic things people were using it for at the time. destinyhud they both sucked at that time but android sucked more than iOS at that time. SVem26 I like to think I am in the nerd userbase and I don't care what kernel is used.. can you help me understand why it matters? UnlikeABoss Do you want a brand new obscure kernel in thing that holds most of your sensitive details? TipTop I don't want something that dates back to 90s, is full of zero-days and horrible code contributed by nobodies. UnlikeABoss The idea that it is full of zero days is hilarious. You do realize that the majority of Linux exploits are local, right? Unlike Windows. Yes there is obviously code from the 90s, but very, very little of it. Not to mention that age is not a factor in deciding bad code. The idea that old code is bad code shows your inexperience. By that standard, should we dismiss Chrome because of all the exploits being found in code that was written when it first started? Are we going to create brand new software every few years to purge "old code"? Do you have any idea whatsoever how much Linux has actually changed? Do you have any idea how much of this change is because it's considered a "universal" kernel everyone can use and is focusing on? Do you really think splitting the community over onto another kernel will increase security for either of those kernels? There's a little something called code maturity. There's a reason Microsoft has way less exploits in its kernel today than 10 years ago. They didn't write a new kernel from scratch. Sir_Brizz All OSes are full of vulnerabilities and horrible code written by nobodies. If that is your requirement then you must have gone full luddite by now. ihsan ışık Are you implying that Android got popular because of "nerds" who heard it uses the Linux kernel? UnlikeABoss If you are old enough to know the early days of android you'll know that having every single nerd on the internet promoting Android over iOS most certainly helped get the ball rolling. Once it was pushed, it snowballed into what it is today. m477 Sure. It was the nerds on the internet, not the manufacturers with ads everywhere. Most people still don't know their Galaxy runs Android. UnlikeABoss The giant billboards came YEARS afterwards, cmon. m477 Yes, and that's why Android was so unpopular in the early days. UnlikeABoss What? It was massively popular among all techies for being the open source iOS alternative. m477 You are overestimating the "techies" crowd. Even BlackBerryOS was more popular at the time. Only after the Galaxy S it started to grow, and became popular among normal people. UnlikeABoss Not really. We are talking over a decade ago now, there were far less people on the internet and it was far easier for techies to promote products because everyone was asking their "techie" friend what is best. But these days everyone is an "expert" so that's not as much of a thing. m477 Again, you overestimate how many techies there actually were. Your personal experience is anecdotal. Market shares and sell data are objective. Also, over a decade ago Android was still a camera os, and it wasn't public. UnlikeABoss No, I do not. The further back in time you go, the higher the proportion of techies there were using the internet versus others. People were only just starting to look at buying a smartphone, and asking techies what they should buy. m477 Yes, the concentration on the internet of "techies" on the internet was greater. And? What normal user at the time went to the internet, looked at reviews and said "Oh, look! The HTC magic has Linux! This random guy says its good, so I'm gonna buy it!"? You really think that a bunch of "techies">marketing? A guy saying that his toy-looking HTC G1 is better than the iPhone is more effective than billboards and tv ads? Come on, even Windows Mobile was more popular. It took Samsung's aggressive marketing to make Android popular. UnlikeABoss Windows Mobile and BlackBerry were more popular in the enterprise, that's it. The entire discussion is home users. Also I think there's been some confusion. I wasn't implying that techies on the internet were promoting Android on the internet like a marketing department. I was implying that the internet was very much a "social media" platform for techies to communicate where the majority of them would use Android and mocked the use of iOS. The actual "marketing" happened offline when a normal user would ask their "techie" friend for first time buying advice. It is nothing like that today, and the internet is nothing like the techie community it once was. m477 So, what you're saying is that the internet was a circlejerk of Android users. Ok, and? It didn't affected normal users the slightest, iOS was still more popular until Samsung took Android more seriously. The techie friend thing its only your anecdotal experience, it bears no influence on the market, in the grand scheme of things. I'd even argue that Google's very light marketing did much, much more. Also, the mindless techies that recommended half backed devices instead of better alternatives because "Uh, Linux!!" did more harm than good, both to the users and to Android. UnlikeABoss If you read my OP you'll see my original point was that Google has rode the "Android circlejerk" to popularity, and you can debate how much popularity that added as much as you want. The fact remains, it got the ball rolling. Samsung didn't pick it up "just because", it saw that a lot of people were pushing it. There were several OS at the time it could have used, including sticking to its own. Why bother with Android? Maybe because it wanted to see how much market it could take by appealing to techies? However, if you stand back and look at it, how is this any different from "embrace, extend, extinguish"? Google used that "free marketing" and has now decided to use it's massive popularity to push a different product. (Which has failed in the past and will hopefully fail again). Why hate Microsoft for doing that in the past, but we praise Google for doing it? Why are we excited for something we know nothing about that is creating fragmentation? m477 Samsung had used several OSes, it had Windows Mobile and Phone devices, Symbian devices, and proprietary devices, even Palm OS devices IIRC. They used them all. Android had was the easiest to personalise for them, and create a copy of the best selling product, which was the iPhone, and there was an app market, so they tried to release and market their flagship with it, and market it as broadly as Apple. The first Galaxy (the "non S") was was vastly ignored, because it was as little marketed as all their other devices. The techies crowd was insignificant. The free marketing is just as much as Windows 10 gets for incorporating Ubuntu's bash terminal. What you saw is not really important. I saw lots and lots of Windows Phones in 2010 and 11. Many more than Android devices. Every one I knew had one, and if I had to say which OS was the most popular only based on my personal experience, in my smallish city, I'd obviously would say Windows Phone. Why are you so attached to Linux, excluding all possibilities of giving a possibly better solution a try? The community will just fork the AOSP and continue the development of the Linux branch. UnlikeABoss Cmon, we both know Android was not easier for them to customize than simply using their own OS. No one was recommending it, techie or not, no matter how much they marketed. It's only now they are popular they are trying to slip in their own OS, and still failing. I am not attached to Linux despite people using it as an easy scapegoat to dismiss a discussion critiquing almighty Google. We currently have a situation where most kernel developers focus entirely on Linux, making it virtually the universal kernel. Why are we creating pointless fragmentation there? Why divide that community? Do we honestly believe that a divided community can produce a better kernel, or do we love it because Google is doing it? Would we love it if Microsoft did this? m477 The proprietary OS they used at the time was a Java based thing with a flash interface. Hardly able to compete against iOS. It was easier for them to use the "next Symbian" that they could customise as they wanted, and that also had an app market. If they made, say, Bada, before Android become established and popular, and marketed it as much as they did with their Galaxy S, the market would be very different today. The normal user doesn't care what OS their shiny phone runs, as long as there's facebook. I am a GNU/Linux user since the first half of the 2000s, and I've always critiqued Google for using Linux as a kernel on phones. Linux might be the universal kernel, but smartphones need a more streamlined solution. I don't care if it's Google, the MIT, or Richard Stallman in person to do it. I liked WP8 architecture. Fragmentation is not pointless if it brings benefits to the user. TipTop Nobody cares about your FSF agenda. John Q I think the chief reason Google is not using Linux is that they want a real-time OS (RTOS). Linux is at best a "soft" RTOS, possessing a real-time scheduler but this is still not nearly as real-time as an actual RTOS should be. It would take a very large effort to do that for Linux so it makes sense that Google would want to make their own kernel that they can have full control over. UnlikeABoss Let's ignore the fact that Linux is used in real time car systems for a moment. Could you elaborate on why you think Google would want/need a RTOS on their smartphones? M6 The kernel they're using, 'magenta', is opened source. So who cares if they're using linux or not? Does everyone have to use linux? UnlikeABoss No it doesn't have to be Linux. But who else will use Magenta? Probably no one. So why are we fragmenting the kernel space further? Why would you choose an immature kernel for something as valuable (your data) as your smartphone. Would you trust that? I would much rather developers continue focusing on a single kernel. WesleySmalls But wouldn't Magenta be this single kernel? UnlikeABoss If everyone decided to ditch Linux and focus purely on Magenta as the universal kernel, yes. Will that happen? WesleySmalls Could be, just not overnight. The market was already fairly well developed when Linux arrived in 1991, yet it still managed to become a very, if not the most, important player in the market. It's certainly possible, it will just require proper investment(and neglect of their alternate platforms) and patience to make it work M6 That's some straight up communist shit right there. Let's just work on one thing, because we only need one thing, everything else is redundant! Let's not allow other people to do the same thing in a different way, because competition totally doesn't spur innovation at all. WORPspeed So Andromeda definitely dead or still happening? sleepinlight Pretty sure this IS Andromeda, or at least a part of it. Andromeda was never an official name for anything, it was just the internal project name for some sort of new and/or merged OS. WORPspeed I thought Andromeda specifically referred to merging Android and Chrome OS. So is that specific merger dead or on life-support? John Q Nah, the Android/Chrome merger was just speculation from what Andromeda seemed to be. There was never any concrete evidence to imply that Andromeda was a merger. WORPspeed To quote Androidpolice : "So please, when you see Fuchsia mentioned, or speculation that it "is" Andromeda, know that it is just that: speculation. Last we heard from sources we consider extremely reliable, Android was the basis of Andromeda, and Andromeda would see its commercial debut on a new Pixel laptop later this year. It is possible Google has changed plans around Andromeda, that the initiative itself may have even been scrapped. Though, we have no reason to think so - it's more that we don't know, and haven't heard anything about Andromeda in quite some time." http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/02/15/speculation-around-googles-fuchsia-os-and-andromeda-is-creating-confusion-and-misinformation/ WORPspeed http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/02/15/speculation-around-googles-fuchsia-os-and-andromeda-is-creating-confusion-and-misinformation/ That makes them seem very separate Srujan https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/e7fda716dfcfdca76e200e51a9c9144c72e183c7e76d36b910c20ee0931aee79.gif destinyhud if this replaces android rather than having 2 separate codebase, I am all up for it. splitting the android community is dangerous senor_heisenberg Well if this does end up being what replaces Android or what Android evolves into, I just hope my apps and whatnot are compatible. Ain't got the time or money to be investing into another ecosystem. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman That's a tricky, double-edged sword. I can't fathom they would not support the old apps, or at least the vast majority of them, for exactly that reason. But in doing so it will likely be held back at least slightly from what it can/should be. Backward-compatibility tends to hold everything back. What I'd wager is we won't see this until hardware's powerful enough to make emulating the old system in a VM relatively cheap and easy, with back-end Play Store penalties to developers who don't shift to the new app models, and then slow phase-outs in stages of the older functionality and support until the new OS is running exclusively its own setup. senor_heisenberg That sounds good. Randy Gindy I think Google porting the Android Run-time to Chrome OS was to see if they could do it. morteum This is old news, I'm waiting for Fuchsia 2.0 Barracuda. /s marcusmarcus2 What if they aren't going by Animal names in general but by mammal names. I'd skip the Fuchsia 2.0 Bandicoot. It will probably be "Crash" prone. Alfonso Surroca Three operating systems is not nearly enough. We need at least two more announced at I/O.

Suicide_Note There is no update problem. Nexus/Pixels run the latest and greatest. OEMs who mess with the OS give their customers severely delayed updates. pfmiller Nexus and Pixels run the latest and greatest for two years. Nobody would accept this OS update situation if it was on a desktop OS. MJ Thank God it's phones we are talking about and not a desktop PC. marcusmarcus2 That is exactly why Windows XP lasted only a couple years before all computers updated to Windows 7... Seriously though. I'm fine with only getting Android version upgrades phones for 2 years. But they really need to extend out security updates beyond 3 years. Suicide_Note This isn't a desktop OS, not to mention people tend to change phones much more often than their desktops. pfmiller Sure it's not a desktop OS, but no sense pretending that what we have leaves nothing to be desired. And sure people change their phones more often that their desktops, but there's absolutely no reason to change every 2 years. Doby Gillis Which is a problem, Einstein. Suicide_Note Not if you're a Nexus/Pixel owner, Dilbert. Randy Gindy I would generally say there is. Android phones are not supported for nearly as long as an iPhone. The reason being that the chip set manufacturers do not release new drivers. Shelly-Man Vol 2 It's looks pretty neat for a development stage. Rami Well Android has to reach Z someday.

Neither, this is just a side project many developers use to test and work out the feasability of a variety of things. Android is a very well developed environment, and replacing it whole is simply a no-go. Things will just gradually evolve, as they have already done with Dalvik being replaced by ART, for example. Sir_Brizz I don't think you're wrong, but it would be in Google's best interest to start building a non-JVM runtime that apps can run inside with a native language that Google has 100% full control over like Go or Dart.

PVL_93_RU Those "stories" on the "home screen" look like they'd fit perfectly for a kiosk-type display, where you have a lot of space to work with JG Fuchsia is a purple-y pink color. T-Mobile's color is Magenta, a slightly different purple-y pink color T-Mobile is rumored to be looking into launching their own phone... Coincidence??? Almost certainly, without a doubt yes... But consider... T-Mobile also launched the first Android phone... yoloswag Inspired by the messaging team, Google wants to start working on a 2nd operating system. JG Magenta is designed for "modern phones and modern personal computers with fast processors, non-trivial amounts of ram with arbitrary peripherals doing open ended computation." Modern personal computers huh? I've been interested in Google packing ChromeOS into a LiveCD type set up we could test/install on our own computers... (*Yes, I know of Chromium, haven't tried it yet... But I would prefer it coming direct from Google, faster updates and all that). It could be interesting to try out another of Google's OSs without having to fork over several hundred for new hardware... The only problem would be drivers to support the various hardware. If not modified too much, ChromeOS could possibly use the original Gentoo Linux drivers. But with Fuchsia using its own unique kernel... That might throw things off a bit... I know a few less tech-savey individuals who would probably be more comfortable if the same OS powered their phone, tablet and desktop (should Google opt to replace Android with Fuchsia). Especially if it could run both Android apps and Chrome extensions natively.

Now, it’s been discovered (via ArsTechnica) that an actual user interface for Fuchsia is in its earliest stages, and luckily, we can take an early peek… The best gifts for Android users Looking back for a moment, you may recall that Fuchsia’s future is still very much up in the air. Google has been working on the project out in the open and so far we only know a few things about it. Included in that is, first, that this OS drops the Linux base Android currently has in exchange for Google’s “Dart” programming language. Further, this new OS seems like it will work on several different platforms, including mobile phones and tablets. Thanks to the hard work of a Kyle Bradshaw at HotFix.net , we have our first look at the new UI in action and an early glimpse at how it differentiates itself from Android. Obviously, this is still a very early build of this OS, and almost nothing works so far. As you can see in the video below, we can simply see the barebones of how this UI works at this point in time. Focusing on just the UI for now, we can start by talking what appears to be a home screen. It appears that this home screen takes the focus away from applications and instead focuses on personal information, Google cards, and what appears to be some sort of recent apps menu. Front and center is the user’s profile image which, when tapped, can reveal a handful of quick settings for brightness and volume among others, and which also looks a bit like Chrome OS’ quick settings menu. That menu also has “Log Out” and “More” options, but it’s unclear what those will do since nothing is working yet. Opening and closing this menu also shows a very fluid (and pretty) animation. A swipe down from the main screen reveals what seems to be a new “recent apps” screen which inserts “apps” that are opened in chronological order, just like Android. Swiping up from the bottom reveals some sort of Google menu that appears to recommend which apps to open, as well as offering a quick shortcut to the search menu. It’s also interesting to note that Fuchsia appears to have a new keyboard that is fairly similar visually to Google’s Gboard on Android. The entire OS is very clearly influenced by Material Design and purportedly thanks to the “Dart” programming language behind-the-scenes, all of the animations are incredibly fluid. That’s especially impressive considering the fact that this is a pre-alpha build running on another Android device. Outside of the video, ArsTechnica shows off some other portions of the OS, including the tablet UI and multitasking features. Like current versions of Android, the multitasking menu appears to trigger multi-window modes, this time doing so by dragging one app in that view on top of another. That triggers a 50/50 split, but that’s not all “Fuchsia” is capable of. Apparently, the OS can handle three apps at once with a 33/33/33 split, or even four apps at 75/25/75/25. Behind the scenes, Fuchsia uses a Google microkernel called Magenta which helps run the operating system with the same levels of performance regardless of the hardware it is on, something Android has struggled with a lot even to today. The interface and apps are also written using the Flutter SDK which creates code that works on Android and iOS, meaning that apps written with Flutter (in the Dart language) can work with the two main operating systems as well as Fuchsia. This is one way Google could prevent the app-gap that has ruined so many other mobile operating systems. The future for Fuchsia is still completely unknown. Some signs point toward it being a potential Android replacement, but if that is the case, it’s going to be a long time before that happens. Ron Amadeo from ArsTechnia brings up the interesting idea that the Fuchsia project simply asks what Android could/would be like if it was designed today. Android wasn’t developed with billions of users in mind, and because of that, the company has run into a lot of issues over the years. So far, Fuchsia looks promising, but it’s going to be quite a while before we see what Google really wants to do with it.

In a post Monday, Google said it will revamp its OAuth system and update its general spam and security monitoring to prevent a similar attack in the future. Google said it’s had previous protections in place for email-based phishing, including in-app Gmail warnings for suspicious emails and spam detection. Read: Google Docs Phishing Scam: How Can You Protect Yourself From Phishing? “Upon detecting this issue, we immediately responded with a combination of automatic and manual actions that ended this campaign within an hour,” Google said. “We removed fake pages and applications, and pushed user-protection updates through Safe Browsing, Gmail, Google Cloud Platform, and other counter-abuse systems. Fewer than 0.1 percent of our users were affected by this attack, and we have taken steps to resecure affected accounts.” The Google Docs phishing scam worked by sending a fake Google Docs email to users from accounts that they’ve previously contacted or would know. In the email, users would be directed to a real OAuth prompt that would direct them to a fake Google Docs app. Once their credentials were authorized, the app would pull from a user’s contacts and spread the initial email to more users. According to Google, less than 0.1 percent of Gmail users were affected by the exploit. OAuth refers to Open Authorization, an open standard that lets users authorize third-party websites or applications to utilize their account information without requiring a password. It’s commonly used when applications or games direct you to an external webpage to connect it to an account from a service like Google or Facebook. Read: Email Attack Hijacks User Accounts By Posing As Google Docs While Google’s patch for the Google Docs phishing attack looks to prevent a repeat event, it also wasn’t the first time Google had heard of the exploit. Researcher Andre DeMarre posted about a similar exploit on a mailing list and reported it to Google in 2012, Motherboard reported. As DeMarre wrote in his initial post in 2011, a malicious third-party could easily rename the app to impersonate a reputable source, just as the Google phishing email came from a fake Google Docs app. "Imagine someone registers a client application with an OAuth service, let's call it Foobar, and he names his client app 'Google Inc.' The Foobar authorization server will engage the user with: 'Google Inc. is requesting permission to do the following.' The resource owner might reason, 'I see that I'm legitimately on the https://www.foobar.com site, and Foobar is telling me that Google wants permission. I trust Foobar and Google, so I'll click Allow.' "To make the masquerade act even more convincing, many of the most popular OAuth services allow app developers to upload images, which could be official logos of the organizations they are posing as. Often app developers can supply arbitrary, unconfirmed URIs, which are shown to the resource owner as the app's website even if the domain does not match the redirect URI. Some OAuth services blindly entrust client apps to customize the authorization page in other ways." Google recommends users take precautions like using the Google Security Checkup and reporting suspicious emails to Google via Gmail. Enterprise users should also use security measures like enabling two-factor authentication and running OAuth token audits to find problematic scope grants.

Amazon Echo and Google Home both offer features that I’d like, but there are things I do with Siri on my iPhone and Apple Watch that only a Siri Speaker would offer. Here’s my Siri Speaker wishlist: Sony A6500 For starters, I hope we actually see the so-called Siri Speaker introduced at WWDC next month. Reliable supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities wrote last week that there’s a greater than 50% chance we’ll see the Siri Speaker announced at WWDC, but that leaves a lot of room for no such announcement. Siri Speaker is also said to be manufactured by Inventec, which is currently the sole manufacturer for Apple AirPods … which are still backordered by six weeks after roughly six months on the market. If the so-called Siri Speaker is ready to be shown on stage but not ready to ship, Apple could always preview it alongside an expanded SiriKit with more capabilities for developers than Siri offers today and release it later in the year. There’s no existing Siri Speaker to take sales from and in turn Apple could potentially spoil a few Amazon Echo and Google Home purchases. One message you often hear ahead of WWDC is that it’s not a hardware event, however, so should that be a clue that we won’t see Siri Speaker next month? Maybe, but Apple has used WWDC to introduce hardware in the past (Retina MacBook Pro, Mac Pro preview, older iPhones before the fall launch shift). Just guessing in the dark, I would imagine it is more likely that we’ll see Siri Speaker previewed and not released for WWDC, but I hope I’m surprised and Siri Speaker is something we can purchase soon after Apple’s keynote next month. Based on Ming-Chi Kuo’s latest research note, it sounds like Siri Speaker will use audio quality as a key selling point thanks to seven tweeters and a subwoofer. Amazon Echo makes for an OK music speaker, but it’s not pitched as a hi-fi speaker by any means. Siri Speaker could take a more premium position in the market by boasting better audio quality while using Apple Music as a service made for it. This line of thinking makes me question the name we assign the rumored voice assistant speaker: Siri Speaker. If Apple markets the device as a hi-fi wireless speaker for streaming Apple Music more like what Sonos offers that just happens to feature Siri, is it really a Siri Speaker or might Apple go with something more general like say Apple Speaker? At any rate, I personally hope Siri Speaker offers integration with existing Sonos speakers. Apple Music integrates with Sonos speakers with a controller app on iOS and macOS, but there’s no Siri integration. Compare that to Amazon Echo which will work with Spotify for easy multi-room playback through Sonos speakers. ‘Siri, play My New Music Mix on the living room and office speakers.’ I would be all in if this could work with Siri Speaker and Sonos speakers. I think it’s possible given that Apple Music and Sonos already work together and Apple recently started selling Sonos speakers in Apple Stores, but I suppose it’s also possible that Siri-controlled multi-room Apple Music playback could be limited to multiple Siri Speakers. We’ll see… Siri Speaker will be a shared device used in shared spaces so voice profiles will be essential to a great experience. Take Reminders for example. If I say ‘Siri, remind me to call mom on Sunday’ I’ll want it to go to my Reminders list based on my voice. If my wife says the same command, ideally the entry would be added to her Reminders list. Going back to the music focus, even using a command like ‘Siri, play My Favorites Mix on Apple Music’ would ideally work for more than one user. User profiles could be used as a fallback, too, if voice identification doesn’t work 100% of the time. A command like ‘Hey Siri, it’s Zac, add shrimp pasta to my recipes Note’ could work. In terms of what Siri could do on a speaker without a display (assuming Siri Speaker is voice-only), try activating Siri on your iPhone from headphones. Siri becomes more verbose than when activated from the Home button since it doesn’t know if you’re eyes-free or not. I really want a Siri Speaker to be my always-listening, always-present HomeKit controller for the smart accessories around my house too. My wife and I share our HomeKit profile so we can both use the Home app and Siri on our devices to control lights, temperature, and more. Having a Siri Speaker in the living room could instantly share the same access easily with our guests. I think talking to a Siri Speaker is more natural and much easier than sharing access through the Home app with a guest who may or may not even have an iPhone, not to mention the learning curve of using the Home app. Have a babysitter over for the night or family visiting from out of town? Just tell them to talk to the Siri Speaker naturally to control HomeKit accessories. Optionally, you could have a mode that only allows known voices to control accessories. Voices that aren’t recognized could be prevented from controlling any HomeKit devices. Siri Speaker could also be one more option for a HomeKit hub. HomeKit currently relies on an Apple TV or iPad running iOS 10 to be present for remote access and automation, but Siri Speaker could be a solution as well. Siri Speaker with a great music experience, multi-user support, and easy HomeKit control is exactly what I want. Others hope Siri Speaker might be a more comprehensive product that includes networking features and more. I would guess based on the rumors that the audio focus is all Apple will use to make its product standout from Amazon Echo and Google Home, but I do believe there could be an opportunity for more Siri-enabled products. If audio is the focus and Siri is just along for the ride, you can apply the same formula to standalone routers, home security cameras, and more. Just like how we’re already starting to see thermostats with Alexa built-in, we could potentially see a range of AirPort routers and future HomeKit devices from Apple with Siri built-in. Again, based on the rumors today, I would guess that a Siri Speaker is the only thing coming out of the product pipeline anytime soon. But if the product is a hit, it could make room for future variations. So far Apple has expressed that it views Siri on the iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, and Apple TV as all you need from a voice assistant. The benefit of this approach is that Siri goes where you go versus being tied down to a room, but I still remain curious about the benefits of an always-present, always-listening version of Siri for the home and family too. Sneaking Siri into a hi-fi speaker would certainly let Apple compete with Amazon and Google in this space without backing away from the current approach too.

Google Pixel long-term review: Still the best smartphone I've ever used David Ruddock Follow View All Posts 2017/05/02 3:28pm PDTMay 2, 2017 76 Plus 1 on G+ 341 Share on Facebook 123 Share on Twitter Total Shares540 News Phone Reviews Pixel Pixel XL Article Contents 1 The hardware 2 Battery life 3 Display, audio, and wireless 4 Camera 5 Performance and software 6 Value 7 Conclusion I have been using the Google Pixel XL for six months now. Not continuously, mind you - I have taken breaks here and there. But after using the Galaxy S8+, the LG G6, and the OnePlus 3T, there is only one phone I've instinctively found myself returning to, and it's this one. Google's Pixel isn't without its flaws; in fact, it has a great many I can cite with ease. The Bluetooth connectivity sucks. The back of the phone has very obvious wear rub. The glass window scratches easily. It's not waterproof. 'OK Google' hotword detection breaks for no apparent reason, necessitating a reboot. The fingerprint scanner is slower than what you'd find on a number of competitor devices. The value proposition is mediocre at best. The screen to body ratio pales in comparison to phones like the G6 or Galaxy S8. And you can't even buy the damn thing. Why do I keep picking up the Pixel time and time again, then? Am I just a brainwashed Google fanboy (don't answer that question)? The answer is consistency. In the nearly seven years I've been doing this, I have never used an Android phone that has held up so well to the tortures of time. The Pixel XL feels nearly as smooth as the day I began using it six months ago. Android glides along with best-in-class touch latency and a responsiveness that feels immediate (if not manic) and satisfying. It's not just performance, either. My battery life remains largely predictable, too, and largely very good. The camera continues to impress with its swift launches and ease of use, and it produces the most consistently excellent results of any smartphone camera I have ever used. HDR+ is easily, for me, the best smartphone camera feature out there. Oh, and even if the fingerprint scanner is a bit slow compared to some, at least the damn thing is easy to reach and reads consistently. Is the XL worth $770 to pick up today? I don't really think so, let alone $870 for the 128GB version we all actually want. And honestly, I have a hard time seeing the point of the smaller 5" model at $650 right now, that just feels like lunacy. The XL offers better battery life and is far from "big phone" status in terms of actual usability - it's really the only one of the two that warrants consideration, in my opinion. With that, let's dive in to the details. The hardware Put the Google Pixel XL next to a Galaxy S8+ and you'll have a pretty hard time finding much to love about Google's phone. 2017 is ushering in a new era of smartphone design language and packaging, and the Pixel XL clearly hails from the period prior to that shift. To be fair, it did come out six months ago. But there's no doubt that from an industrial design point of view, the Pixel is aging fairly rapidly. The 5.5" Pixel XL is nearly as tall as a Galaxy S8+, but the latter has a 6.2" display. Line up the bottom of the S8's screen with the Pixel XL's, and it becomes apparent just how much more panel Samsung has managed to shove into a frame that is only a few millimeters taller. Granted, this does have ergonomic consequences (the S8+ is unabashedly more difficult to use one-handed than the XL because of the screen's height), but I think it's safe to say most of us want more screen where we can get it. I still think the Pixel XL is perfectly nice to hold and like the texture of the aluminum opposed to Samsung and LG's new glass-heavy designs. I also still believe the fingerprint scanner is in the ideal location, unlike the Galaxy S8, which has the most frustrating one in existence. The position of the camera makes accidental smudging less likely, too, and I really like the perfectly flush look Google was able to achieve with the glass window. Visible wear lines on the casing In terms of wear and tear, my XL has... not fared well. The finish on the Quite black model I have here has begun to very noticeably rub off in areas where the aluminum chassis is slightly more raised than others. You could remedy this with a skin, but I personally like this phone totally unadorned. Otherwise, though, it's held up well - the buttons are still fine and I don't notice any real physical problems with the phone aside from the aforementioned finish wear. Just don't drop it in the toilet. Battery life As I said in the introduction, it's consistently good. I always have a pretty clear sense of how much time I've got left when I'm really starting to push my XL to the limits of its longevity. If I'm having a Wi-Fi heavy day with lots of using the phone for browsing the web and texting, 5 hours of screen-on time is doable. If I'm away from home and largely on LTE, I can pretty reliably get 4 hours of screen time assuming it's not stretched over much longer than a 12-hour period. For a full 16-hour day away from wall outlets and going it on mobile data alone, 3 hours is what I generally end up managing. This probably won't impress many of you with Xiaomi, Huawei, or Exynos-powered Samsung devices, and I understand that. But the thing about the Pixel has been just how well I've been able to learn what I can expect in terms of battery performance based on the conditions I'm using it in. I know I can throw in a bit of tethering and Bluetooth streaming without completely obliterating the battery, for example, if I'm at 60% halfway through my day and won't top up till later that evening. My range anxiety with the Pixel is exceptionally low, even if it doesn't offer the very best battery life of any smartphone. Would I like the next-generation Pixels to have larger batteries? Yes, please. Relying only on software to ensure a good power consumption experience is missing half the equation (and I'm not saying that's what Google did). Stuffing even a few-hundred more milliamp hours of capacity in there can be the difference between a dead phone and one that gets you back to the charger at the end of the night. Always fit a bigger battery when you can. Display, audio, and wireless The Super AMOLED Quad HD display still looks bright and crisp, even if the new panel on the S8 is clearly a cut above the part Google is using on the Pixel. Even so, I think the screen is one area where the Pixel XL earns its $770 keep, as there really aren't many phones out there you're going to find which are considerably better in this regard unless they have "Galaxy" inscribed on the back. On the audio front, I found the Pixel's bottom-firing speaker mediocre at the time I reviewed it, and I find it mediocre today. Sadly, it's not getting much in the way of competition, either - both the G6 and S8 have speakers that are at least as unimpressive, if not worse in certain respects, and I hope Google can at least give us that quasi-BoomSound using the earpiece speaker on the Pixel 2 this year. The headphone jack offers performance in line with most Snapdragon 820-series devices and thus isn't the best candidate for pushing your high-impedance cans, but I find it perfectly serviceable in the gym even at high outputs. The quality is there, even if this generation of Qualcomm parts didn't offer as much power as audiophiles probably would have liked. One of my biggest gripes about the XL is its Bluetooth performance. I have used three separate Pixel XLs, and all of them have absolutely terrible Bluetooth signal. Even think about touching the phone in the wrong spot, and the music stream to your headphones or car will cut out. It is absolutely obnoxious. It doesn't matter what kind of headphones, speaker, or car A/V unit - it sucks with anything I've tried. Even walking around with the Pixel XL in my pocket connected to a pair of Bluetooth headphones results in cuts every single time I step up a stair or rest my hand against the pocket the phone is in. The 7.1.2 patch has done nothing to alleviate this issue. It's borderline embarrassing: I have had the Pixel XL corrupt the Bluetooth profiles on my car three times. Each time, the only solution was to factory reset the infotainment unit. I had to factory reset my car. No other phone has ever done this to me, though since the 7.1.2 update this hasn't happened - yet. Wi-Fi performance, on the other hand, has been quite excellent for me, and LTE signal is at least as good as most other phones I tested in 2016. Now that I'm on Verizon, I'm even getting some HD voice calls, which is such a huge upgrade in terms of the call experience. But seriously, Google: get the damn Bluetooth right next time. Camera I can't stop taking pictures with the Pixel. I love this camera. No more words: just photos.     Performance and software Aside from the aforementioned Bluetooth problems, you know what I find so wonderful about the Pixel? I rarely really get annoyed using it. Apps load up at consistently quick speeds, the OS always feels snappy and responsive, and the touch latency is positively iPhone-y. Like your finger is truly controlling the elements on the screen. The home button and back key respond lightning-quick, in a way that almost starts to make them feel like real buttons. I struggle to really convey how right Google got the basic "interacting with the phone" stuff here. What they managed to do with the Pixel will only make the Pixel 2 that much better a phone, and I will be clear: I do not feel this way about the Galaxy S8. The Pixel feels incredibly natural and pleasant to interact with. There are still hiccups, delays, and little areas where things just don't feel as smooth and seamless as they should on the S8. Google nailed this. No other phone I've used has. Is the Pixel as fast in a straight-line speed sense as a OnePlus 3T? No. But counting fractional differences between the number of seconds it takes to load an app or how long before it's pushed out of memory are not methods that convey an experience. They tell you a couple of very specific things under a controlled circumstance. In practice, I simply find the Pixel the most consistent and smooth Android smartphone I've ever used. But, it does have some usability issues. For one, my 'OK Google' hotword detection breaks basically once a week, necessitating a reboot. I use this when in the car, and so it's very, very inconvenient when this happens. Rebooting the phone takes a good minute-plus, and then it has to reconnect to my Bluetooth (which is never guaranteed to work). This is probably something to do with the Google app, but it's annoying nonetheless. Other than that? I struggle to find anything about the software that I really dislike. Most of my frustrations come down to third-party apps, not the Pixel. And those are annoying on any phone I use. Value When it debuted in October, the Google Pixel XL cost $770. The one you and I actually want, the 128GB model, cost $870. Six months later, the Pixel XL still costs $870. Is it worth it? Hah. No. The successor devices to the current Pixel family will be unveiled in the next five or six months. There is absolutely no good reason to shell out what, with tax, amounts to nearly a thousand dollars for this smartphone. You will absolutely regret it the moment Google announces the Pixel 2 - I guarantee you. Do not buy a Pixel right now. In fact, I'd say just don't buy a Pixel period anymore, we're just too close to the next iteration for that to be remotely sane advice. Conclusion So, that's weird, right? I can't even recommend that you buy what is easily my favorite Android smartphone currently on the market? What kind of long-term endorsement is that? That's because for all its problems and limited availability, the last six months I've used the Pixel have utterly proven to me that Google is capable of building a smartphone that, from a user experience standpoint, rises above the competition. Google's unmatched ability to optimize the way Android and the underlying phone parts interact is very much a reason I love this phone so much. A smartphone should get out of its own way when you use it - it should be an effortless canvas upon which your fingers and eyes naturally engage and interact. That means it should be fast. It should be consistent. And it should just feel right to use. I know that some of these things don't really translate well into concrete assessments, but there's something about the Pixel that really just works for me so well. It's as close to my ideal smartphone as I've ever been. I'm hoping that Google smoothes over some of the rough edges not just with the phone, but with the whole experience of buying and owning it. Why is is to hard to buy a Pixel? It's positively ridiculous just how bad Google has been at keeping this phone in stock. I also think it's hard to ignore that in 2017, the Pixel's design language and overall look and feel are clearly behind the competition. This looks like yesterday's smartphone, and even on the day it was announced it was kind of hard to really fall in love with in an aesthetic sense. At best, it's just kind of boring. Post-purchase experiences should improve, too. Google's online and live chat support are very-just-OK, and what I've heard of the RMA process hasn't been super reassuring - full price credit card holds and iffy-quality refurbished replacements. Of course, that's what happens when you're in the online-only phone sales business. Still, Google should be working to streamline defect, warranty, and accidental damage claims in a way that makes it feel like the nearly-thousand dollars you spent on your phone is going into supporting a thousands-dollar-phone experience. They really also need to stop making crappy cases that are obscenely overpriced. Google made a great phone when it built the Pixel. Now Google needs to be a great phone company. I'm curious to see if they can pull it off. Tags google pixel long term review google pixel review pixel long term review pixel xl long term review subscribe ...

My 6P is losing longevity and running super slow these days. Just can't bring myself to overlook the Samsung FP scanner or I might have settled for an S8. Tr3ple I'm warming you don't do it. I settled for a s7 edge after my 6p, big mistake OhYeah! I made that mistake with the Galaxy S3 and then the Edge 6. Both were disappointing and much worse than my Pixel XL. I love the Pixel! Dean L I got used to my S8+ fingerprint scanner after about a week. I absolutely love the position now, and never touch the camera anymore. Carson Saldanha Throw in free banana splits and you've got a deal! ;) Rickinbsb pick 2 Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ "My 6P is losing longevity and running super slow these days." I see people say all the time that it's Samsung phones that always get slow over time. Intellectually dishonest people, I guess. sweenish They can both be right, you know. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yes, I believe they're both right, depending on various factors. My Note 4 is running better than it did with Lollipop, and a little slower than it did with KitKat. It probably has at least something to do with the Android version and what apps you install on it. My point was that it's intellectually dishonest to pretend it's a Samsung problem, as if it's unique to those phones. And that's how the people frame the problem. sweenish And you were just framing it as "not us, but them." Not better. If I misread your intent, I apologize. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ You did misread my intent. No problem, though. Treeburgerface It's Android that's the problem. Some Android phones get slower than others. Some Android phones lag more than others. But eventually they ALL get slower and they ALL lag. I've heard 1000 people swear that Android is "silky smooth" and "fixed" now over and over again, before "project butter" and long after and it's still not true. It's certainly improved, which you should expect with the 3 Ghz 12 core processors and 8 GB of RAM they are packing in them now, but at this point I kind of doubt Android is ever going to be quite as flawless in the GUI department as other OS's which were designed to prioritize touch input and treat the users finger like God they way they should and which prioritize reliability over ultimate capability. Just depends which set of sacrifices you are more comfortable with. Ismail Akram Well that totally sum up a perfect phone for me :) Just add Powerful AMP in that Ghisy This, times a million! And also a cheaper, not overpriced XL with at least a 5.7" screen. Then Google can have my money. Meanwhile, I'll be keeping my Nexus 6P. Rod "My 6P is losing longevity and running super slow these days" I don't get this. How is it running super slow all of a sudden? Did you fry half of your board or something? My 3 year old phone performs exactly the same way as when I first unboxed it. Try running in safe mode, because there's probably a rogue app in your end.

Stock Android is always buttery smooth. Even when it isn't. Louis Smith I'm in the same boat. Sold my OP3, Loved the phone, but someone else wanted it. I just kept on going back to my N6P.

Sean Opinion: Even if you can, you probably shouldn't buy a Google Pixel anymore............. David Martrano I'll take my edge over the pixal Any day. I've never had the loss of a Bluetooth connection. Plus there always backordered. I tried to purchase back in December and Google told me I had a 60 day wait. I said OK and moved on. When you lose consumers to me that's not good business! Either have them in stock or lose money! senor_heisenberg It's a Google product, so I'm not even surprised. Just a weird company. ericshmerick Yesterday: don't buy this POS Today: I love this phone lulz Daishi And in both articles he said not to buy the phone. It is advice. He explained himself quite well with several caveats. His point is valid. There is no real reason anyone should buy this 6 month old phone for its introductory price, even if the phone had no flaws. Bob Thank you. Rod You should. However, you'll need to time travel back to the launch day. Tr3ple Incoming triggered Sammy fanboys.... OligarchyAmbulance "WUT?!?! What do you mean your Samsung lags? Mines *never* lagged! It runs as well as the day I bought it, you *obviously* have a defective unit!" username_not_valid I feel the need to factory rest a device several times a year anyway, Samsung or not. David Martrano Totally agree, my edge has never lagged. Purchased over a yr ago. Just as fast as the day I bought it. Plus with the Nouget update even better! deadpenguins My fiance's gs7 is less than a year old, yet it *constantly* lags and hangs up. She has to restart it at least once every few days and has to charge it twice a day even though she barely uses it! See how useful anecdotes are? OligarchyAmbulance Woosh Jermell Howard Jr Lol funny and true but lets be hone st Google in the Smartphone world is like France and Samsung is like the U.S. Jeff Beck I'm not sure who that comparison favors. Jermell Howard Jr The U.S is a world superpower and France is not. Samsung is much bigger in terms phone market share Winston But Samsung doesn't have a loud CEO who tweets in all caps during his morning bowel movement. Jermell Howard Jr 😂 ok? King_Android 😂😂😂 xyz Yeah, they just have a better education and healthcare system, and higher quality of life statistics. But America does have a lot of big, shiny bombs. I'll give you that. Marty Nah, still not biting. Me no like HTC. "I have a hard time seeing the point of the smaller 5" model at $650 right now, that just feels like lunacy." I'm one who prefers a smaller phone. Had Apple included an FHD display on the 4.7" iPhone 7, I'd be sporting one with a Cheshire Cat grin. RyRyTheFunBun I think that Apple did the right thing by sticking with just an HD display on the 4.7. Good density with less of hit on battery. But if they wanted to make the phone thicker.. rockon999 I just bought one. Honestly David, 6 months is a long time to wait to buy a new device (Pixel 2). My Moto X is done for and I wanted a good phone. What can I say. At least I don't use Bluetooth and don't mind cases... Paladin27 I just bought one... 4 weeks ago and got it yesterday. Great timing on these two articles, AP. :-/ BUT, My Nexus 6 is dying and I needed something new. I weighed the options, my wife even has a G6, but I'm glad I got the Pixel XL, and besides, it will be 8 months before anyone actually has a Pixel 2 in their hands. whispy_snippet I wouldn't worry at all. Both of you. You got what in my book is still the best phone you can get. Not the best in every single way, but the best in the ways that are arguably the most important. JDC Great article @rdr0b11:disqus. Fair and balanced. I feel the same way about my Pixel. I also have the fun time of explaining to friends and family why my Pixel is the best Android phone I've used BUT they shouldn't buy one. I personally can't wait to see what improvements are made to the Pixel 2. mwolverine I have an OP3T, and one thing i don't get is how is the user experience on the pixel superior? Both are running nearly stock Android and are very consistent. Tr3ple You'd be surprised how much better the Bexel XL actually is compared to the 3t. Granted the 3t is the best bang for the buck out there. Duder12 It's more fluid and smooth. What don't you understand? Ismail Akram Have you used Pixel for yourself for month or for a week? I had OP3(not T) and came to Pixel XL. One thing very obvious to me when switching was smoothness between the two. Pixel animations feels more natural. and scrolling feels so smoother, its not massive difference and normal users can't even tell the difference, until he have used so many phones. then Software update thing is really awesome on Pixel. Camera is best for me on Pixel. Display is also great. In term of looks I prefer OP3 more. well IMO if Pixel have better design it would be even better for me. BTW I hear people have a lot of issues with OP3T touch latency which OnePlus improved but not gone. people don't even notice these latency things until they use phone with less touch latency. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Given that you admitted many (but not all) of it's faults, if that's the best phone you've ever used, you've set the bar incredibly low. crackcaffeine You sound like you know a lot about this topic. What is the best phone you've ever owned? Inb4 Note 7 Grahaman27 "It's the best smartphone ever but don't buy it!" Which half of this is bullshit? Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Neither, if you read and understand the context. Grahaman27 A new phone probably launching in 6 months (that we know nothing about) is not a valid reason to not recommend buying a phone. Tr3ple It's an opinion you know? Jarrett Lennon Kaufman If that were the only reason he stated in the article, I might agree with you. Again, read and understand the context. MJ Did you consider reading the article and trying to understand the words? David Martrano That's like saying do as I say don't do as I do! Suicide_Note I'm just grateful i haven't experienced any issues with the Bluetooth on my XL. Keith Stefanec Me neither. Sean Me either CF542 You guys are lucky. I'm on my second Pixel and still have Bluetooth issues. Not as bad as the first unit but still a problem. Love the phones​ though Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I frequently see comments by people who say they're on their 3rd or 4th Pixel. It makes me wonder how many of those 2.1 million Pixels HTC shipped are replacement phones. David Martrano When the day comes when they sell 50 million pixals, please let me know. It's a great phone for a limited audience! Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ "Limited audience" -- I couldn't have described its fans better than that. Tom Takumi Okamoto Google should buy OnePlus to improve them as a phone maker. NexusKoolaid How did that work out for Motorola? Tom Takumi Okamoto Not well. I don't think Google wanted to be a phone maker at that time because the Nexus program was still on. If I'm not mistakin it acquired Motorola just to protect Android from lawsuits. Knowledgeborn Allah The entire basis of your argument kind of falls apart when you admit that you can't recommend for anybody to buy it, and I think that's because of the Pixel's main problem: it's overpriced, underpowered, and unsustainable on Android's current platform. The fact that it'll be DOA by 2019 just makes it worse. Could I recommend that people buy the Pixel XL right now (if they could get their hands on one anyway)? Nope. Could I recommend that OnePlus 3T? Yes, definitely! The S7 Edge, which is OLDER than the Pixel? Yes! There was even an article I read today with reviewers STILL recommending people to buy the iPhone 6s Plus to save money, and that device came out 2 years ago! When compared to those devices, the Pixel just doesn't hold up, which is why I don't think anybody would recommend it today, only 6 months after its release. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ They expected to sell 3 million by the end of 2016 and 7 million more in 2017. HTC has shipped about 2 million since it was released over 6 months ago. 'nuff said. whispy_snippet Can you provide references for these assertions? OligarchyAmbulance The reference would likely be his anus. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Google "htc shipped 2.1 million pixels". For comparison purposes, Sony shipped a total of 5.1 million Xperia phones in Q4 2016. And that was a drop of 33% year over year. whispy_snippet That's not a reference. That's some words inside double inverted commas. Tr3ple https://www.google.com/amp/m.gsmarena.com/google_has_already_sold_21_million_pixels_report_says-amp-24270.php whispy_snippet Thanks for this. But it only states the amount of Pixels sold, being 2.1 million. I haven't seen a reference where Google officially states "they expected to sell 3 million by the end of 2016 and 7 million more in 2017." A statement like this sounds like horse shit to me. There's no way Google would be foolish enough to make a specific target like this available to the public. In other words, Felonious Monk is almost certainly bull shitting. Again. Tr3ple He wasn't bullshitng lol http://www.digitimes.com/news/a20161006VL200.html whispy_snippet "Sorry, the page you are trying to open is available only for our paid subscribers." Tr3ple pocketnow.com/2016/10/06/google-pixel-smartphones-4-million-sales-forecast whispy_snippet Are you even reading the articles you're referencing? Once again, nowhere does it say Google "expected to sell 3 million by the end of 2016 and 7 million more in 2017." He's bull shitting because that's what a bull shitter does. Tr3ple Google never said that, that's your boy up there paraphrasing. Either way they predicted the phone to sell quite a lot. And it is. whispy_snippet He's not paraphrasing. He's manipulating information, being deliberately misleading, and bull shitting. Completely. Tr3ple "Digitimes Research's Taiwan Mobile Device Tracker - HTC's handset shipments are expected to reach 6.5-7 million units in the second half of the year, up less than 10% from 5.8-6.1 million units in the first half." whispy_snippet So is the digitimes research device tracker establishing projected figures based off their own analysis or from direct statements from Google and/or HTC? OligarchyAmbulance So you know how many phones Google expected to ship because you made it up and it's now a fact? lol Alright, buddy. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Android Authority: "Report: Pixel shipments could hit 4 million this year" (2016) "Morgan Stanley: Google on track to sell 3 million Pixel devices in 2016, 5-6 million next year" Google it for yourself. Randy Gindy Googled. Found several sites that reported Pixel sales already being 2.5 million. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Cool. No sources, but I'll trust you. Maybe by the end of 2017 they'll hit the projected sales target for the end of 2016. Randy Gindy Where were your sources? Randy Gindy Xperia is a pretty well known brand already in several markets. The Pixel brand hasn't had much exposure aside from the couple models of developer oriented Chromebooks and Tablet. I wouldn't assert that because an established brand sells better than a brand that just really started that it makes it a bad phone. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Xperia is a great example of a failing phone in the US, at least, which is why I used it as a comparison. "You may as well pretend Sony doesn’t exist in the U.S" https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/why-sonys-xperia-phones-keep-failing-in-the-us/ Randy Gindy It maybe a failing brand but it is established. Tr3ple Just shut it, ill recommend a pixel over all these phones you mentioned, s7 egde won't get anroid P, I can guarantee you that. Until you've owned and used a pixel XL you shouldn't comment on it. tim242 It is HTC trash. Tr3ple Yeah we get it, you don't own one. tim242 Why would I? Hardware issues galore. Not to mention, the stock problem. Tr3ple Lol as i thought, move along. tim242 Deflect much? It is well documented trash. Tr3ple Hahahahahaha, like I said move along tim242 You can't deny it, so you deflect. You must be a trump worshiper. Jeff Beck Well, that escalated quickly. Richard Dennis Yea... yea.. we know you're here you're queer get used to it.. Next! Safe circles, safety pins, and pink hats for everyone.. (Paid for by the government of course) tim242 Damn str8! Knowledgeborn Allah Fanboyism at its finest... The Pixel is not a good buy compared to any of those phones, and I DO have the Pixel XL. I know from experience that it's overpriced, underpowered, and unsustainable with Android's current system. 🤦🏾‍♂️ The S7 Edge probably won't get Android P... And? Based on the chart just released (scroll up), most other Android devices probably won't get Android P either, at least not until "Android R" is out. Lol! Tr3ple Judging by what you said I doubt you have a Pixel XL. Yes it's overpriced, just a lil. If somebody don't care about the price, yes pixel is definitely a better buy Knowledgeborn Allah What kind of sense does that make? It's a "better buy" if you don't care about the price? 😳 Like I said, it's overpriced for what it is. Tr3ple yes plenty of us don't care about the price, it makes plenty of sense. Pfft Knowledgeborn Allah The idea of being a "better buy" contextually includes the price. The fact that the Pixel is overpriced for what it is automatically means it's not a good buy. And again, that's coming from somebody who bought the XL variant at launch. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ The OP3T and Axon 7 are much better buys. Knowledgeborn Allah Absolutely! Tr3ple No, the idea of "better buy" is a combination of EVERYTHING. Software, camera, build quality, reliability etc.. and let me tell you that the pixel is in fact t the better buy, only phone on that list I think MAYBE might be a better buy is the 3T, but the camera and battery life are ok not great, but for the money yes. Knowledgeborn Allah Yes, everything, INCLUDING the price. Again, the fact that it's overpriced means, contextually, that it's not a good buy. This shouldn't be that hard to understand. whispy_snippet I don't think it's over priced at all. Knowledgeborn Allah You don't think it's overpriced, being identical in price to the iPhone? I've heard other people make that claim, and yet they believe that the iPhone is overpriced... What's your view regarding this? Do you think the iPhone is overpriced? What does something being overpriced mean to you? whispy_snippet I guess I should rephrase. It's not over priced when compared to what it's competing with. "Over priced" is a bit of a relative term. It doesn't hold a lot of meaning. What is over priced to one person might be a steal for another. I think you can make the argument that compared to other phones the Pixel, iPhone and Galaxy S8 are all expensive. But over priced? That's a murkier discussion. Knowledgeborn Allah I agree, but I think status plays a role in pricing when it comes to other manufacturers. Samsung and Apple both have established brands, and people are willing to pay top dollar for their devices because they've already proven themselves. Google isn't in this same position in the smartphone hardware department. Also, I'd say that both lines - e.g. Galaxy S series and iPhone - offer much more in the way of unique features and premium hardware than what Google offers with the Pixel. But that's just my personal perspective... whispy_snippet See that's where I'm not so sure. The Pixel still has the best camera of any smartphone and an amazing display to back it up. Straight away it's hit two areas out of the park that matter to most people. At launch it had a class leading SoC that continues to offer great performance. It has plenty of RAM. Rock solid build quality. A super fast and accurate fingerprint sensor. USB-C (remember the GS7 didn't which was Samsung's 2017 flagship) with fast-charging and excellent battery life. It has the most capable voice assistant. It's got the latest version of Android and what I believe to be the best overall user experience for most people - it's consistently fast and smooth, unlike anything from Samsung, and will receive timely updates for much longer than the competition. The Pixel is the iPhone of the Android world and I think it has a market to fill. Do I think the Pixel 2 needs to be better? You bet. No one is denying this. What phone doesn't need to be better than its predecessor? If the Pixel 2 doesn't at least have waterproofing and a higher display-to-bezel ratio critics will hold them to account. But I'm pretty sure these features are a guarantee. The thing is, and I've said this elsewhere, I don't really consider a lot of the hardware bells and whistles we see from the likes of Samsung all that meaningful. The curved display is a gimmick. It looks great, but I'm not at all sold from a functional perspective. The same with the new 18:9 ratio. For a mobile device I consider one handed usability important. Reaching the notification pull-down with one hand is already a no-go on the GS8 and its fingerprint sensor is another ergonomic mis-step. And a heart rate sensor? Who on earth uses this? Same goes with its iris-scanner and face recognition. Why use these options when a well positioned fingerprint sensor is more convenient? It's all just guff. Bullet points for carrier salespeople to sing about in store. I think waterproofing is a biggie though. Google can't drop the ball here. I also think wireless charging is going to become significant if Apple introduces it to their new iPhone. We've seen Google offer wireless charging in the past and then take it away because, well, I don't think that many people really cared. But I sense the tide is going to turn on this. Google's phone is priced the same as the iPhone and Galaxy S because it's being positioned as a premium product. I hate the word "premium". It's huge BS when you really think about it. But ultimately this is the strategy Google is taking with its new phone. A high margin, high performing, premium flagship for the masses. I think the best of the Pixel line is yet to come. Knowledgeborn Allah I also think the Pixel launched with a lot of good qualities and features, and that's why I rushed to purchase it. However, around the same time, I bought an iPhone 7+, just to give iOS a fair shot. Now that I've used both devices, I think it's a huge mistake to call the Pixel "the iPhone of the Android world". In reality, it doesn't even come close, and that's where the problem comes in. The iPhone is Apple's primary device when it comes to sales, but it can almost be seen as an accessory to other Apple devices, like the Mac and the iPad, etc. The Apple ecosystem allows all their devices to work together seamlessly through Continuity, and this is something Android can't replicate (at least not at this point in time). The Pixel may look similar to an iPhone, but it definitely doesn't function like one. And yes, I know that Samsung (and carriers) puts a bunch of bloat on their devices, showing off features that many people will never use. The difference, though, is all about opportunity and selection. Samsung built an entire brand around giving their consumers more than they'll ever ask for, and that's what keeps those customers coming back. I don't know anybody who uses that heart-rate sensor on the back. When I see it, I think, "Why wouldn't they remove that and use the idea of the heart-rate monitor to sell more Galaxy Gear smartwatches?" I just didn't get it... But, hypothetically, if somebody ever ends up in a situation where they need a heart-rate monitor, Samsung has them covered. I learned that firsthand when my nephew was taken to his school nurse due to an asthma attack, and the nurse didn't have a heart-rate monitor in her office. Her assistant pulled out his Galaxy S7 Edge and used the heart-rate monitor on there to relay it to medical services when they arrived. I know, that would be a generally rare occurrence, but it happens from time to time, enough for people to consider what would happen if they didn't have it. Personally, I don't think Google has enough "skin in the game" at this point to really charge that much for the Pixel. Apple and Samsung have proven brands in the smartphone space. Tech reviewers giving it high marks isn't going to matter too much among average consumers, because most people just aren't interested in technology to that extent. They just want something that works, and works reliably. Google hasn't demonstrated the ability to make hardware that just works reliably (unless you count the Chromebook Pixel line, which most people didn't buy either). It's always better to start at the bottom and work your way up, than to start at the top and get knocked all the way down. Sean Everyone on here KNOWS you dont have a Pixel or a Pixel XL......but troll on......... Knowledgeborn Allah "Everyone on here" knows what I have? Seriously? You're an idiot. 💩 Knowledgeborn Allah I find it quite funny that anybody who criticizes the Pixel is automatically labeled a troll, a hater, a sheep, etc. How ridiculous! ¯_(ツ)_/¯ Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ After Marshmallow, I stopped caring about new Android versions. I'm almost afraid to get a Nougat phone, given there have been so many problems with it. As for O and P, I'll let you Pixel users alpha test it and then decide if I care about getting it. Knowledgeborn Allah 😂😂😂 I actually bought the Pixel XL mostly because I've had every Nexus device since the Nexus 4. I thought it would be a great device, but I was disappointed. It's not horrible, but it's definitely not worth the price. And, to be honest, I haven't really used it consistently in months. I use it occasionally to access the Google Play Store, but that's about it. My primary device nowadays is an iPhone 7+, and it's miles ahead of the Pixel XL in almost every way. Alex Louderback "DOA by 2019" is a contradiction, my friend. Knowledgeborn Allah If we're talking about release timeframe, you're right. But there's a big difference between when a device is released and when it's in the hands of the consumer. Last time I checked, the Pixel XL variants are still out of stock, even though nobody's buying them. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman DOA means "dead on arrival," which was Alex's point. It can't be DOA by years from now. Knowledgeborn Allah That's cool and all, but that's not a counter argument... OK, maybe "DOA" wasn't the best terminology, but the points still stand. The device, today, 6 months after its release, is still too flawed to recommend. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Stop comparing it to an iPhone. No other Android phone should be purchased six months after its release either. Only iPhones have that status because they have no competition within themselves. Within Android, after six months, there's another king of the hill. But I wouldn't recommend a Galaxy six months after its release, or ANY other model of Android phone. Knowledgeborn Allah "Stop comparing it to an iPhone"? 😳 Google released the Pixel devices to directly compete with the iPhone! If they can't do that, then why are they matching it in price? If the product is devalued already, then Google needs to drop the price. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Put a fake button on the huge chin and it would look exactly like an iPhone. That's no accident. Sean You and Knowledgeborn Allah should have a troll off competition.......... Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Because your point has NOTHING to do with the Pixel, and EVERYTHING to do with Android as a whole. The reason the Pixel's not a good value proposition at this point is because it's competing against all other Android phones, which together are competing against the ONLY iPhone. You can't compare them in this regard. Period. Also, there's no point in comparing them because if I wanted an iPhone I'd own an iPhone. I don't. In which case I'm determining the best Android option. Right now, someone who isn't buying an iPhone, shouldn't buy a Pixel. That has nothing to do with the iPhone and everything to do with the competition in its own space. Knowledgeborn Allah That's not true. Every Android device isn't designed to directly compete with the iPhone, but that's exactly what Google tried to do with the Pixel. So, yes, they can definitely be compared. Just because the Pixel doesn't stack up doesn't mean that it shouldn't be compared. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Android, as a whole, is designed to compete with the iPhone. While the Pixel has to compete with both the iPhone AND all of Android. "Just because the Pixel doesn't stack up doesn't mean that it shouldn't be compared." You're not reading or comprehending my words if THAT was your takeaway from what I said. Not bothering anymore. Knowledgeborn Allah Android as a whole? Android is an operating system. Its rival is iOS. You're positioning the platform as if it's completely one-sided. The iPhone has to compete with various Android devices too. It just happens to have an ecosystem of hardware to aid it along the way. You're acting like an Android OEM can't do the same thing if they put in time and resources. Based on the fact that Android manufacturers are only pushing out hardware components for smartphones (and occasionally tablets and smartwatches), I'd say their biggest competitors are other Android OEMs, not Apple and iOS. For the record, the LG G6 wasn't designed to compete with the iPhone. It's competing with the Galaxy S8. The HTC 10 was competing with the G5 and S7. It's never been an Android vs "Apple ecosystem" thing on the manufacturing level. The only OEMs who actively try to compete with the iPhone are Samsung (S and Note lines) and Google (Pixel line), and it looks like Huawei is just starting to build up their consumer base in the West to do that too. The others are generally competing against other Android OEMs. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Your first paragraph made my entire point for me: Android manufacturers', including Google, biggest competitors are one another, *not* Apple and iOS. But ANDROID's biggest competitor is iOS, which has only ONE device line: the iPhone. The Google Pixel, while it may have been designed as Google's attempt to battle the iPhone, doesn't exist in a vacuum. It's still ALSO doing everything from the first paragraph: competing against all other Android manufacturers. No matter how much Google may *want* to break out of that, their wants are irrelevant to reality. And the reality is that the Pixel is one of many Android phones, all of whom are competing against one another, the sea of which is competing against the iPhone. So how well the Pixel stacks up against the iPhone isn't relevant, as it's not the focus of this article or the reasons for David's position. WITHIN the Android ecosystem, it's simultaneously the best Android phone he's ever used (same here) and not a good idea to buy it right now BECAUSE OF THE REST OF ANDROID and NOT for any reason having anything to do with the iPhone. For anyone who wants to buy an iPhone, which is a massive number of people, there is absolutely no competition, allowing them to charge anything they want. For anyone who wants Android, there's an endless sea of competition, making the Pixel's price and specs within the refresh cycle a much harder sell right now. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ The headline is, "Google Pixel long-term review: Still the best smartphone I've ever used" not the best Android phone. I assume he meant Android phone, though. Still all smartphones compete with one another. And if the Note 8 is disappointing, I'll definitely consider getting an iPhone 8. Because the best smartphone (for what I want and need) is what matters to me, not the best Android phone or even the best (insert OEM here) phone. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Cool. We have different priorities, which is fine. I couldn't use an iPhone. Apple products and their ecosystem don't fit my needs. So I'm looking at *only* Android phones. So it's entirely a matter, at any one time, of what the best *Android* phone is. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I thought I couldn't use an iPhone, too. But I've used an iPhone 6S Plus now, and it's really quite a good phone. Even the display is better than I thought it would be. And that's quite a compliment coming from someone (me) who will never use anything but AMOLED. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman I have to use them for my clients sometimes. They're fine. They work well. I'm still too embedded in Google's ecosystem in ways that don't make switching feasible. Knowledgeborn Allah I get your point... I still think there are certain ways around that, especially considering Google's vast amount of resources. But yes, I see how that could definitely be a problem. They could still salvage the Pixel line, though, by providing standout features like Samsung does, or by undercutting their competition with their pricing like OnePlus does. I think either of those could work fairly well. The notion of putting standout features in their devices could be a challenge, since their devices pretty much serve as a template for Android as a whole. Undercutting the competition would be easier, and that's what Google actually did for years with the Nexus program. I think that's the big "bust" factor for them. If the Pixel could be purchased for $450-500, it would still be a good purchase even now, just like the OnePlus 3T. But it's really hard to justify paying $800 for the Pixel while the Galaxy S8 and G6 are on the scene. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman They already went for standout features. They made a big push to be more "opinionated" with several software and UI customizations, along with their big hardware push. The difference is a huge number of the Galaxy standout features just aren't that compelling. That's the sort of stuff they skipped. Knowledgeborn Allah When I mentioned standout features, I was talking about exclusive ones. The Pixel doesn't really have any. They marketed the phone as having the "best camera on a smartphone", and that's turned out to be a debatable subject among people depending on their perspectives - whether they like realistic colors or oversaturated photos. The Google Assistant is now available on pretty much every Android phone, just like the fingerprint scanner gestures. The hardware from the front looks strikingly similar to the iPhone -which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it leads people to question why they should get an iPhone lookalike, when they can get the real iPhone for the same price. The display is decent, but it's not even as good as the one on the Galaxy S7. Google ditched stereo speakers for a mediocre mono speaker. Pixel Imprint is noticeably slower than the fingerprint sensors on many cheaper offerings. The Pixel launcher was all the rage, until pretty much every third-party launcher started adding many of its features into their custom launchers. To make matters worse, the device is almost always completely out of stock online and unavailable to purchase through carriers. And those are just basic factors. Add to it the fact that Google just published an EOL report for the Pixel, solidifying the point that it'll stop getting Android OS updates in less than 2 years from now, and people are going to say, "F**k that!" That's why, personally, I think they should drop the price and salvage what's left, unless they really don't care about selling them. whispy_snippet Price and value are not intrinsically linked with "premium" products. You don't just drop the price on a product you're trying to position as high end because it's gotten a little older. You're only going to tarnish its reputation. A major reason why many people buy high end premium products is BECAUSE they're expensive. Marketing 101 mate. Phones are modern day status symbols. I remember when the Pixel launched some people scoffed at the price and said "well I'm just gonna wait for Google to discount it in a few months". I tried to tell these people that it wasn't going to happen and that the best "bang for buck" time to buy the Pixel was actually launch day. And here we are, months later, and the Pixel is still being positioned as a high end premium product. And believe me, it'll still be priced at the high end right up until the Pixel 2 launches. Apple have long been the masters of pricing their products at the high end of the market despite cheaper alternative offering features that savvy buyers demand. But look how well Apple has done. Billions of dollars in the bank thanks to sales in a product often considered a step behind the cutting edge. If you want a cheaper phone with certain features important to you, get one. There are countless options. But give up on the idea of a cheap, affordable Pixel. It's NEVER going to happen. Knowledgeborn Allah I'm not disputing that. You're correct in saying that many people buy high end products because high prices give the illusion of inherent quality. The problem, however, is that the Pixel is competing against the iPhone, and it hasn't worked. In fact, it can't and won't work. There aren't any Android OEMs who can realistically compete with Apple. They may design devices that compete with the iPhone, but they can't compete with Apple. Why? For starters, continuity. When you buy a Pixel device, you're buying a product. When you buy an iPhone, you're buying into the Apple brand and ecosystem, where all their devices, ranging from the Apple Watch to the Mac to the iPad, iPod Touch and Apple TV, and even AirPods and Beats wireless headphones, all work seamlessly together. Secondly, you're buying into the Apple Store and it's customer service benefits. Thirdly, you're buying into Apple's update cycles, which come directly from Apple to all their devices instantaneously and average around 4-5 years of support. The list goes on and on. Google isn't naive. They have their own ecosystem, but it's centered around their software and services, which you can get on practically any device. They don't have a hardware ecosystem. They knew what they were getting into, and they took a chance by trying to compete directly with the iPhone in pricing. They also see that it's clearly not working, so it's time for them to adopt a new strategy. If they actually want large groups of people buying their devices, which I'm not entirely sure they do, they either need to have standout features like Samsung Galaxy devices (which they don't), or they need to lower their prices. Right now, lowering the price on the Pixel is the only way they can salvage it. whispy_snippet I disagree on many levels. You don't establish yourself as a hardware company overnight, and you don't establish a product's premium reputation overnight. Yes, Google doesn't have the same hardware ecosystem Apple has at this stage. But they've now got skin in the game that matters most - phones. All of the products you listed from Apple don't come close to the significance of the phone. Many will never own an Apple TV, a MacBook, or Airpods. But almost everyone owns a phone - and we don't know where hardware is going to take us next. Maybe in a few years time tablets will be dead, everyone will be using hybrids and home assistants will be one of the most important gadgets in our lives. Who knows? The point is just because Google doesn't have the same suite of products as Apple doesn't mean they won't one day, or that they won't be the company that leads the pack in the hardware that matters tomorrow. Further to this, just because the Pixel lives in an ecosystem different to the iPhone doesn't mean it can't be a success in its own right. Google is known for its class leading services. What happens if it starts gradually making these hugely important and much loved services - like Google Maps, Google Drive, YouTube, Google Photos... even Google Search - Pixel exclusives? It sounds improbable - almost impossible! But it serves as a reminder of how powerful and influential Google is in the services EVERYONE uses, Apple customers included. Google entered the hottest fight in consumer tech and delivered a hugely impressive smartphone on its first attempt. It wasn't perfect, but it bettered the competition in a number of important ways. Who knows what Google has in store for the Pixel 2, 3 or 4? They're in this for the long haul. You can't expect the Pixel to sell like the iPhone and Galaxy S in its first, second or perhaps even third iteration. But as time goes by, the Pixel will stand shoulder to shoulder with Apple and Samsung's best in the minds of the average consumer. There's too much at stake for Google to sit this one out. Knowledgeborn Allah I think you're missing my point... I'm not saying Pixel can't be a success. It definitely can be, but Google needs a better strategy to make that happen. When you're competing against a company that has a structured, proven hardware ecosystem that seemingly locks users in, you have to do something extraordinary to break them out. Samsung is doing that by releasing groundbreaking smartphones. OnePlus is doing that by undercutting flagship devices via pricing. What's Google doing? The idea that Google has leverage because of their services is naive at best. Google isn't going to make their services exclusive to the Pixel or its brand because they make too much money from their portals. If they restricted YouTube to the Pixel, everybody would switch to Vimeo or something else, and Google's stock would plummet. The same goes for pretty much all their other services too. The only leverage they have is in financing, and that's very comparable to Apple anyway. In fact, I think Apple may actually be worth MORE than Google at the moment. In reality, Google will never try to conquer the hardware space. Services are their moneymaker, and the more devices they can attach their web services to, the better it is for their bottom line. That's what it's really about, at the end of the day: money. The Nexus program was more popular than the Pixel, even though there was far less advertising for it, because Google implemented a strategy of undercutting their competition. They probably thought that meant people just loved their devices and decided to launch a "premium" product. In reality, one of the main selling points of the Nexus line was its affordability. The Pixel doesn't have that, and that's why it's not selling. Again, they need to undercut their competition in pricing, or they need to implement standout features that are exclusive to the Pixel. I see those as the only sure ways to salvage the disaster that is the Pixel line right now. whispy_snippet Maybe grab yourself a cup of tea... “I think you're missing my point... I'm not saying Pixel can't be a success. It definitely can be, but Google needs a better strategy to make that happen. When you're competing against a company that has a structured, proven hardware ecosystem that seemingly locks users in, you have to do something extraordinary to break them out. Samsung is doing that by releasing groundbreaking smartphones. OnePlus is doing that by undercutting flagship devices via pricing. What's Google doing?” But is Samsung making ground breaking smart phones? Is Apple? No one is doing anything especially impressive at the moment. A larger display is a nice to have, and I've no doubt everyone is going to follow this trend, but it's not what I'd call “ground breaking”. The same applies to hardware features like wireless charging, stereo speakers, or dual cameras. All nice to have, but merely extensions of core concepts of how we use our phones. So what? I think Google has a unique edge through its ability to leverage its vast swathes of data and machine learning to create personalised services that no one else can. They’ve been leading the game in key areas of software and services for many years now. That’s not to say Google is perfect of course, but take mobile photography for example. With the Pixel, Google was able to enter the phone market and best the competition first go through software expertise. And look at Assistant. It’s way ahead of Siri despite Apple getting the major head start. Google Chrome is the leading web browser. Google Maps is the leading mapping service. Google Search is so dominant in our lives that it spawned the phrase “just Google it”. Smartphone hardware has just about reached conceptual maturity but software and services are absolutely ripe for further innovation. And if I had to bet on which company has the greatest potential to revolutionise this space I’d bet on Google. Not Apple, and definitely not Samsung. “The idea that Google has leverage because of their services is naive at best. Google isn't going to make their services exclusive to the Pixel or its brand because they make too much money from their portals. If they restricted YouTube to the Pixel, everybody would switch to Vimeo or something else, and Google's stock would plummet. The same goes for pretty much all their other services too. The only leverage they have is in financing, and that's very comparable to Apple anyway. In fact, I think Apple may actually be worth MORE than Google at the moment.” Of course Google isn’t going to flick a switch overnight that takes all its services away from non-Pixel users. I’m not suggesting this would be any sort of sensible strategy. But it’s not hard to see Google making certain features of these services Pixel exclusives as a first step. Let’s picture ourselves a couple of years from now. Hypothetically speaking, what if Google started giving Pixel users access to “YouTube Sports” for free? Or what if they gave Pixel users 2TB of Google Drive storage for free? Or what about unlimited uploads to Google Photos for free? ...wait, they already do this. What about exclusive access to the Google Assistant? Wait, they did this too in the launch stage of the Pixel! Can you see what I’m getting at? In the coming years, as the Pixel gains further traction in the minds of the general public, Google will be better placed to leverage its strengths and make the Pixel a value proposition no one else can offer. Imagine all of the above I’ve listed, and more, only available on the Pixel? Google has a huge advantage on the cloud service side of the equation - an advantage that I think is going to prove increasingly valuable in the coming years. “In reality, Google will never try to conquer the hardware space. Services are their moneymaker, and the more devices they can attach their web services to, the better it is for their bottom line. That's what it's really about, at the end of the day: money.

I see those as the only sure ways to salvage the disaster that is the Pixel line right now.” Google is trying to conquer the hardware space right now. Chromecast, Chromecast Audio, Google WiFi, Google Home, the Pixel, Daydream, Chromebooks, the hiring of Rick Osterloh as SVP of hardware - there’s evidence of Google’s push into hardware everywhere. But you don’t usurp hardware empires like Apple or Samsung with the click of the fingers. This is a long game, one that is going to rage for years to come. If Google continues to develop the Pixel at the same rate it’s developing its services (and by all indications this is Google’s intention) its phone will be a formidable force sooner than you think. The unrefined, “rushed” gen-one Pixel won critical acclaim from tech sites and bloggers everywhere - for example Android Police, The Verge, and MKBHD all rated the Pixel one of the best smartphones one could buy when it launched. Labelling the Pixel line a “disaster” is as laughable as it is bizarre. Clearly it’s selling well as Google is having huge trouble keeping it in stock. And yeah, part of this is because Google is botching its supply train, but teething issues were to be expected. The message to take home from these issues is that there’s a demand for Google’s first phone. It is selling. Not at iPhone or Galaxy S levels, of course. Not yet. But anyone with a reasonable appreciation of the smartphone industry never expected it would. But I would definitely expect the Pixel 2 to sell better than its first gen sibling. Onward and upward. You’d be foolish to underestimate the second most valuable company in the world. Knowledgeborn Allah You're making some really good points... But I highly doubt Google is not trying to conquer the hardware space. They may be merging themselves into the hardware space, but dominating it? That kind of growth would eventually make them a virtual monopoly! They'd be shut down before they reached that point. There can be groundbreaking features of a device without them revolutionizing the way we use our devices. Based on your presentation, the only groundbreaking device on the market would be the BlackBerry KeyONE, since that literally changes the way someone would use their smartphone, at least a modern one. And, by the way, I'm not calling the Pixel a disaster in and of itself. I'm talking about its sales figures when compared to its competition. It's a pretty good device. I've had several issues with mine, and it's been far from perfect, but it's definitely not horrible. However, money is what matters at the end of the day. It's priced in the same range as the iPhone and Galaxy devices. Yet, it hasn't sold in numbers even remotely comparable to either of those. That's what I meant by it being a "disaster". whispy_snippet Apple has long dominated hardware. Why wouldn't Google aspire to be in this position one day? Why would Google be stopped when Apple wasn't? If Google sees an opportunity for growth that they're confident they can exploit they're almost obligated to go for it and provide returns for investors. Google may not ever reach a dominant position but I've no doubt its long term goal is to dominate. Just on the Pixel's sales figures, I'd reiterate that looking at gen one sales compared to the iPhone or Galaxy S is pointless. It really is. It's certain that many people still don't even know that the Pixel exists. What we need to keep an eye on is its growth. Will the Pixel 2 sell more than the first gen Pixel? Will the Pixel 3 do the same again? Will this growth be at the expense of Apple and Samsung market share? Just watch this space. I'm expecting it will definitely keep doing better in the years ahead. But it's going to be a fight. Knowledgeborn Allah I also think that the Pixel will see growth, year over year, at least initially. It's not going to be easy, though, regardless of Google's resources, because they're still going up against Samsung in the Android space. Personally, I think Samsung is going to crush the Android smartphone space for years to come, and there's not much Google can really do about that. The competing spaces, at least right now, are reserved for iOS and Android, and Samsung has gotten the dominant position in Android to become Apple's biggest competitor in the smartphone space. It took them years to get there, and I highly doubt they'd let that position be handed over to Google. The Pixel will be in a better position to secure the dominant position in the Android space if Samsung decides to start using their Tizen OS. Until then, Google will be fighting an uphill battle against Samsung, and they'll pretty much always lose. whispy_snippet We'll see won't we. Knowledgeborn Allah Indeed. Daishi Stop comparing it to an iPhone. Interesting point. When it comes to pricing the Pixel(s), they shouldn't be priced like an iPhone. Google doesn't have the nationwide support systems in place like Apple does. This is an argument for Apple's pricing for their phones. Why should the Pixel be priced as such without the same services??? Jarrett Lennon Kaufman They're at nearly the same level of services. Warranty replacement was intensely simple. Pricing is what it is. I can't argue it one way or the other. Reason was primarily to appear to be in the same class. It's psychological, and there's merit. But the entire point of this article was NOT that the iPhone is the better buy, which is why the comparison makes no sense to make. Daishi How are they at the same level of services? Of the 490 Apple stores in the world, the United States has 269 of them. Each offers not just sales of Apple merchandise including Macs, iPods, iPads, iPhones, Apple watches and Apple TVs, but service them at each one as well. This is the level of services I am talking about. Where are all the Google Stores where I can take a Pixel phone for servicing?? Google does not have this level of support anywhere in the world, so why should they price their gussied up Hold This Cat 10 phone like an iPhone??? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Because it was designed to look like an iPhone to make people believe it was worth what you'd pay for an iPhone. And it has G on the back. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Because, again, the warranty replacement process *without* a store is insanely simple. Simpler, since Apple generally requires you to rely on a store, and there are massive swathes of the country not near them. Also, you left out the word "nearly" to support your strawman counterargument. They're NEARLY at the same level. Also, you're lumping in unrelated things. We're talking about the Pixel, not the entire Android ecosystem. What other devices Apple supports through a store is irrelevant. And you can bring your Pixel to a UBreakIFix store for support, as well, FYI. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ They're out of stock because nobody is buying them. I've seen comments about how they can't find them at Verizon stores. That's because Verizon only stocks phones that they can expect to sell. That's basic business sense. Knowledgeborn Allah That makes a lot of sense... But what about the online Google Store? Google won't even make them available to purchase online, as if HTC isn't even making them anymore. Kevin Aaronson Goddamn, those Bluetooth issues sound nightmarish. I would loose my mind! QueenLuLu So much this!!! I completely agree with this article. I currently have a Pixel, OnePlus 3T and LG G6 and despite all the great qualities the other phones have, I find the Pixel to be the most enjoyable and "complete" Android device I've ever used. And believe me, I have pretty much used them all! I want so much to love my G6 more, but it's impossicant. Better specs or no; the performance and be usability of the Pixel is awesome! I really hope Google steps up with the Pixel 2. If they did, I think it would really give this industry the kick in the rear it needs. whispy_snippet Great read as always, David. But I'm just wanting to ask some questions on the Pixel's Bluetooth performance. Is this just based off your own personal experience or have you got some data to indicate this is a widespread problem? I own a Pixel and use Bluetooth all the time. I listen to podcasts and music over Bluetooth headphones on my daily train commute, I sometimes use my portable Bluetooth speakers outside when I'm having a BBQ or a coffee on my deck, and my 2017 Subaru Impreza has Android Auto - which as I understand uses Bluetooth to transmit audio. Has there been the odd hiccup? Sure. But on the whole Bluetooth performance with my Pixel has been perfectly fine. No stutters, no disconnections, no nagging drop outs and relatively quick connection times. Obviously this is just my personal experience, but if I'm reading your review correctly, the problems you mention seem limited to your experience also. Maybe your accessories and not the phone are the main culprit? I just think Bluetooth sucks in general, personally. Taco Monster At least with my Mazda 3, my wife's Z3C is much much more reliable than my XL, which craps out a lot (see my other comment on this thread). I've found it to be okay with speakers and BLE devices like our August lock. whispy_snippet Hmm I'm a little sceptical about Mazda and their reputation for mobile consumer tech. They're still not officially onboard with Android Auto and Apple Car Play - instead they're still pressing their notoriously buggy and clunky MZD connect in-house system. I'm speculating, but they seem a bit "head in the sand" if you ask me. thetimmysmalls They recently announced Android Auto and Apple CarPlay to come to most of their Mazda Connect systems... At some point. whispy_snippet Yeah I did see that. Promising. But we'll see. Brian Wolters When the Pixel first came out, it would often lock up and sieze my car stereo system to the point where I actually had to turn the car off for 2 minutes and then get it back on. It was frustrating to say the least. With the recent updates to the Pixel, I've not encountered this. whispy_snippet Nasty! What car do you have? Brian Wolters 2016 Jeep Cherokee with Uconnect. It hasn't happened since recent updates. It was so bad, I used another phone until it was known it was fixed. My name is…. Damage control??? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Google could draw a picture of a phone in crayon and sell it as the Pixel XL 2, charge $1,200 for it, and most web magazines would rate it the best phone of 2017. It's self-preservation. And then once you've done that, you can't admit you were wrong. That would not only be embarrassing, it would be biting the hand that feeds you. Tr3ple But do you have one Johny M It's called Appleing it. me me It's the 7 stages of grief after the Nexus 5. Wondering when the press stop writing words about the once-was-interesting Google products. Keith Stefanec Never experienced any of these Bluetooth problems that were mentioned. Single downward speaker sucks. Hopefully, the Pixel 2 will have a bigger screen like the Nexus 6. wjrandon Did you Google make you guys post this? I bet they did!!!! Taco Monster For your Bluetooth woes in the car, at least with my Mazda 3, force stopping Bluetooth Share under Apps does the trick for me. I've even set up a Tasker profile to do this automatically every 12 hours. 😤 I figured this out after resetting the car to factory settings a couple of times. Grey I think these phrasings are disingenuous. My Nexus 6P is the best smartphone I've ever used - it's bigger, it's thinner, it's faster (though I am currently sucking all the RAM out of it and it's constantly freezing up - but my Nexus 4 did that too) than my Nexus 4. That doesn't make it a phone I'm happy with. There's features missing I'd like to have. There's design choices I disagree with. Saying "This is the best phone I've ever used" doesn't at all mean "This is a great phone". Jeff Beck When you have used pretty much every mainstream Android device ever, as David has, it's not a bad compliment. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman ...it kind of does mean that, actually. Unless literally every phone you've ever used is utter crap. But considering who's writing the article, he's used pretty much everything. "Best phone I've ever used" does translate to "this is a great phone." 4Ui812 That picture is so apropos for the title of the story. (If you don't know what I'm trying to say you can ask) brenden gonzalez Loved the article David I agree I got the the pixel from Verizon pre-ordered it and got it the day before I went on sale I've recommend the pixel to everyone I know my parents switched to them my brother and sister did to and I got some friends to switch to it as well and we all love the software experience it's so amazing!! Best phone I've ever owned it's also the longest I've ever owned a phone in 2016 before the pixel came out I had 6 new phones in a year and never did I find one that I liked and wanted to stay on I've tried them all to HTC to Samsung to even apple and LG and sony and I can't put the pixel down! I can't get a new phone even after seeing the s8 I would recommend and buy a pixel any day over the S8 Plus I no like edge on screen hell no!!!!! I would break it and be mad so that phone is too breakable for me! Nigel Antonio I kinda agree, accept I haven't ever gotten any bluetooth issues, i've been in a case since day one, and I don't see wear and tear on the back panel.... I recommend this phone to everyone, but don't go buying it now unless you have an extra 1k burning a hole in your pocket then go ahead.... but I await the next version of the pixel xl 2017, should be dope. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman A few thoughts/counters, in both directions, from my own experience: 1. I have had NONE of these Bluetooth problems you described with any device, including several different headsets as well as my car. I can travel notable distances from it, work out with it, and no disconnects. BUT, I have a Pixel, not an XL. Could that somehow be a factor? 2. Warranty service, for me, was exemplary. Yes, there was a credit card hold, but I'm used to that for advance exchanges. Otherwise it was a 10-minute process via chat, the replacement arrived in two days and was flawless, and thanks to the overall Pixel backup/restore process, the transition was painless. Easiest warranty exchange ever. Also, she allowed me to decide, on my own, to skip going through a factory reset as we both felt I'd done enough of my own troubleshooting. 3. Now the bad one: my Pixel freezes on me semi-regularly. On the one I replaced it was sometimes several times a day, but on the replacement, after about two weeks of use, it's as much as once a day, as infrequently as once every two days. Full-on hard freeze necessitating holding the power button until it reboots. NOT good. Never had this happen before or anything like it on a previous phone. Clearly, if it survived the warranty replacement, it's an app causing it. But how can an app consistently freeze up the entire system to this degree? What's not preventing that? And why is there no easy way to troubleshoot that? This is really bugging me and is the only thing damaging what's an otherwise stunning, stellar phone that's my favorite of all time. Only other disappointment for me is not having an XL which is what I wanted at launch, but the store approved me for just under enough money to get a 128GB XL. I had to choose between 32GB XL or 128GB non, and 128GB was (and still is) more important to me. But I'd rather have the better battery life and higher-res screen for VR. Still, all-in-all, and especially if I can resolve the freezing issue, this is the best phone imaginable, and its limitations are nothing compared to its heights. But yeah... at this point, wait for the next one if you're buying a phone now. Toby Beveridge I have the 5" Pixel with the daydream VR headset and I don't have any issues.. the screen is good enough for me.. way better than my note 4 or s6 Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Cool. Not for me. The pixel density is a serious problem for my enjoyment. Ismail Akram I have bluetooth issues he mentioned and I use Airpods with my Pixel XL.. so I thought its Airpods problem with Android(cuz I rarely use that with iPhone) About freezing it happened to me when I was on beta but after beta I don't remember freezing on Pixel XL ( but it was annoying in the start and I was so dishearted ) I recently had to sell either iPhone 7+ or Pixel XL (so I can buy S8+) and I sold iPhone 7+ :-p cuz iPhone is so easy to get Niall Murray I have the same freezing problem. Often my phone will unknowingly reboot in my pocket too. gizak No BT issues here either and I use BT in my car and headphones daily. As for your freezing, I experienced this too... after some extensive google searching, I narrowed it down to an app or two causing it. Mainly, any older app that uses your GPS periodically to poll for your location. Check apps that use GPS and haven't been updated since the latest version of Android, they may still be accessing the GPS directly instead of asking the android system for location (the newer more efficient way). Wendy By "latest version of Android", do you mean any app that hasn't been updated to Android 7+ software? My phone has been freezing every few days or so, so I'd like to try this suggestion. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Are you talking about the Pixel? I'm curious if these apps freeze other phones with Nougat. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Wouldn't this mean that every other phone running Nougat would freeze up when running these apps? Have you heard of anything like that? gizak Hmm, ya, you would think so. I'm not a code monkey, so this was just a hunch. The forums I came across linked it back to a family locator app causing the freezes and mentioned GPS access as the culprit. For me though, it was the WebMD allergy app that periodically polled my location to provide pollen count that froze my Pixel up daily. When I uninstalled it, my freezes seemed to go away. Wendy I'm getting the freezing error as well. I've requested for a replacement, so I'm hoping that will solve the issue. It's been freezing every so few days or so, not as frequent as yours. motoridersd The only odd Bluetooth issues I have had with this phone are related to it turning off randomly, and it has only done it a handful at times since I got it 6 months ago. I can put the phone in a drawer, walk into another room at the other end of my house, and I get no audio dropouts. Works perfectly fine in the car too. The only time I've had annoying dropouts has been in crowded airport terminals where there are a ton of competing 2.4 Ghz signals interfering and I have the phone in my pocket on the opposite side of the receiving circuitry of my BlueBuds X. Even then, it's a quick blip and it returns. Bluetooth IS much worse with The Dash, but that thing has its own issues and it happens with any other Bluetooth device I use. Maybe the BlueBuds X just have great performance that make up for the Pixel's shortcomings. Jordan I have the regular Pixel 32GB on Verizon. I have had absolutely none of the issues you describe, though Bluetooth is weak, in that if myself or my dog are in the direct line of sight between the device the speakers/headphones, it will cut out. But I have had no issues with the bluetooth in my infotainment in my car (my S6 & S7 did make me reset it a few times, however). Other than the locked bootloader (-_-) it is the perfect device! whispy_snippet A friend asked me the other day whether he should get a Pixel. I said yes. Most "normal" people don't want to wait around for months to see what the next processor is, or whether the screen on the next generation of phones has a slightly better display to bezel ratio, or whether the fingerprint scanner is going to be on the front or back. They just want something that has all the apps they use and works well. The Galaxy S8 has more hardware bells and whistles than the Pixel, but if history is any indication, the Pixel is going to be much nicer to use over the life of both devices. And ultimately, user experience trumps everything if you ask me. Especially for the non-techie. King_Android And it's a good thing they don't read the AP site either. David is speaking to his audience i.e. us nerds, not normal every day consumers. disastrousrainbow Exactly this. Having worked at Verizon for many years, giving Joe Consumer the tech enthusiast viewpoint on why they shouldn't go with a phone that's a few months away from being replaced rarely worked. More so if they were replacing a damaged or lost phone. In a situation like that, I would wholeheartedly recommend the Pixel over any other phone right now point blank dot com. Even with the S8 out. Of course, this would only be the case if they said they wanted, say, the best camera around. Or wanted a reliable software experience, etc. Those keywords would instantly bring the Pixel to mind, and I wouldn't feel bad about sending them off with one because 9 out of 10 times when the next model comes out, they will really not care, especially if their phone is still working well. When it comes to your every day man, it's not the tech enthusiast you should be listening to when recommending something, but rather the needs of the person you're trying to help. Midnitte "When it debuted in October, the Google Pixel XL cost $770. The one you and I actually want, the 128GB model, cost $870. Six months later, the Pixel XL still costs $870. Is it worth it? Hah. No." Google is insane if they think a phone holds on to value that long. Considering all the high profile phones that have released after it, you'd think they would consider a price cut. MJ You have never taken an economics class huh? Supply and demand ring a bell at all? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ That's why you can't buy one. No demand, no supply. MJ I think have seen you troll enough on AP now. BLOCKED Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ LOL!! K77bkny Loooool people getting emotional over this bullshit device.... https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/649f431458908833d91263af6250ee8fbce01c1c6c9d7ca37827b1f65883a97e.gif Midnitte Six months sounds more like supply chain problems, not supply and demand. It's absolutely ridiculous that we're months away from the Pixel 2 and the Pixel 1 still costs $870 in the face of the Galaxy S8 and G6. Like the article, why would anyone recommend the Pixel 1 at $870 today? MJ It is a supply chain problem but that's irrelevant. The fact is the supply is not meeting the demand. Why would Google reduce the price on the phone? People are still buying it at that price regardless of what David, you, or I think about it. Cowboydroid After using a Pixel for several months, it is an insanely overpriced device. The only reason I own one is I got a great deal on it. Comparable performance and hardware can be had for less than half or even a third of the price. Sean People who write such things NEVER actually have a Pixel and are just haters. Those of us that actually have a Pixel (or XL) think they are superior to any phone we have ever owned........thanks for playing. Tr3ple You're so right about that. Cowboydroid Writing this from a Pixel XL right now, fanboy. Why get so emotional about a device? Debanjan Chowdhury I have been using alot of smartphones​. I used the OnePlus 3t, Nexus 6p, iPhone 7 plus, and even I have received the galaxy s8 plus yesterday. And I can surely say pixel xl will still be my daily driver. I am not a fanboy. I always support which works best for me. Yes, if Samsung had opted for a better camera, bigger battery and better fingerprint scanner position, I would have changed my daily driver to s8 plus. Good camera, snappy performance and stock Android are the priorities for me. And my pixel xl gives me all of these things. The Samsung galaxy s8 plus still has just little bit of hiccups here and there. But pixel xl, smooth 60fps all the time. And receiving updates at the earliest and it's unique update system works amazing for me. I would be really happy if it was water resistant. But I can't change my daily driver for only one benefit because pixel xl provides me dozens​ other benefits than my Samsung galaxy s8 plus or s7 edge and​ my iPhone 7 plus. Ismail Akram I had Oneplus 3 and I found Pixel XL to be more smooth and feels better than Oneplus. beside I love monthly security updates and loving that I can try android O( which I already did) and that Camera is really awesome. I think when Huawei can sell phones over $700 why not Google. (I would love if it was cheap but overall experience justifies that money for me) JD Man you need to raise your standards Sean Opinion: Even if you can, you probably shouldn't buy a Google Pixel anymore Winston David: Am I just a brainwashed Google fanboy (don't answer that question)? Yes. No. Probably. Maybe. Unlikely. Believable. Not sure. I'm a rebel. Andrew I know it's nitpicking but. I think you missed an 'us'. 'The Hardware' section, 2nd paragraph, last sentence. "...but I think it's safe to say most of want more screen where we can get it." Vivek Rameses Nobody is buying that piece of shit anyway. This is laughable. AndrewGM Good review, although if it's really the best smartphone you've ever used, then isn't it worth the premium price? Personally, I'm willing to pay another $100 or so for a phone I will use often, every day, for a couple of years and really enjoy using. The extra money in the end is nothing. I bought a used Pixel on eBay, so I saved about $50, but I really like it and am happy to pay a bit extra. The camera is great -- better than the iPhone, which I switched from. ddevito Remember when Android Police was an honest unbiased, tech savvy site? Alex Completely agree. Best phone I've ever owned, by far. Smooth as butter. Google just needs to work on their audio apis, along with other stuff. chumpatrump ive had a p6 huawei for 5 months and its feckin awesome. android like its meant to be - fast, stable, solid, easy to use, 36 hour charge TechGuy22 It's fine for what it is. I like mine. I still prefer my s7e over it. Maybe pixel 2 will better Vic Chai Was Nexus 6P your number one choice? Jon I've only ever connected to a Bluetooth speaker but never had a single Bluetooth issue ever.. Captain On! To whomever has a problem with the "don't buy this phone" line: if you're going to spend nearly $1000 on the Pixel, you're shortchanging yourself by not waiting less than half a year to spend the same amount on an upgraded device; you'd just be flat-out fiscally irresponsible. The 1st Gen Pixel will be a fine purchase after the Pixel 2 comes and the Pixel 1 goes on sale. At that point, it's fair game. You can save money and get a good experience, or you can pay more and get a great experience (relative). kaladdin I have had the Pixel XL since the launch. Yes, it is overpriced but the software experience alone makes it the best Android phone. P.S. I have never had any issues with the Bluetooth. Jago1908 Sorry, I just wasted some time here. I have my Moto X Play for one year now and it feels just as good as the time when I bought it. You're not selling it well. Give us a bit more. You're just leaving it personal. I prefer to use a cheaper phone that is as consistent as the Pixel. There are plenty. Come on! AhmedAlalfy Well why am I surprised ! A site as big as Android Police has to still suck it just not to piss off a company like Google. Well you could have deleted your (opinion article) better than making a fool of yourself like that. I know you said it's a good phone but these two articles in this order are just wrong. Be a man and stand for your words next time or just don't talk if you're afraid you're going to piss someone's off. I'm sound like hating I know but that's how I see it anyway take it or leave it. … I have a regular pixel.. it's awesome. Very consistent. Zero issues. No Bluetooth issues either, and the range is far superior to the Galaxy s7 we have to, so is the audio quality. Almost all his complaints I have never experienced, maybe it's a pixel xl thing? Idk.. and my battery life, is amazing compared to every other phone I have owned. I use a fair bit, and it lasts full day, usually still have 35-40% by 1am.. I stream music on and off all day, apps, surf, video.. usual stuff. No issues with slow finger print scanner either. It's bloody instant. I've owned Windows phones, and many "high end" android phones, and the pixel is the most reliable, most consistent phone I have had. I would buy again hands down. I'll take a product that just works right every time over bells and whistles. Yes make improvements, of course, but it really is the best overall phone I've ever used. Amit Raj I have been using the XL for about the same time...aside from the Warcraft struggle to get the phone, I agree with everything pointed out here. I do get these odd feelings to switch phones to the S8+ but I have no regrets with this phone. Having come from a flavoured android device (S6 Edge), I can vouch for the Pixel's fluidity, and consistency in performance. The only spite I have is the lack of android releases post 2018. Even Apple updates their devices that are nearly 5 years old. Why can't Google?! I can understand why any of the other ostensible android device manufacturers wouldn't rather can't update their devices to the latest android OS...hell they release devices like Rabbits reproducing. But for Google, come on you come out with 2 devices in a year and you can't give us atleast 4 years of android OS updates...leaving aside this rant, I really think you really get the real experience of having a smartphone...i.e. Android really puts the "smart" in smartphone and running it in its native state and on the Pixel it really outshines any other mobile OS to date...hands down....P.S. the Google keyboard could really get some AI updates for suggestions...other than this and the android OS upgrades, I'm a happy camper... Akshay Mehta Has anyone talked about the unlimited storage available in photos app ? I've shot photos and videos of more than 12GB since I got my pixel xl 6 months back. The camera and a consistent battery has just pushed me take so many photos! Even though I want to switch to s8, I can't. I'll just wait for pixel 2. Even though there have been numerous issues with the phone I still love it! Niero Gonzalez Buy it used. You can get a 32gb pixel for $400 on ebay, unlocked. Probably $300 when the new one is released. Unless you're an Android journalist there's no reason to buy an $800 phone unless you really want to show off your sushi photos Ryan Gray What's killing me is the screen burn in. Go watch a youtube video with a primarily solid color. Buttons and notifcation bar cant be unseen. Alisi Google any phone that has an AMOLED display about burn in. blindexecutioner I prefer the OnePlus 3T to the Pixel I sold. Never thought I would say that but I just don't care for the UI choices Google is making. Having the fingerprint scanner on the front along with capactivie buttons is really nice as well. Debanjan Chowdhury I also have a pixel xl and I love it. Debanjan Chowdhury Triggered Samsung fanboys, incoming. Debanjan Chowdhury I am using a pixel xl too but I never had Bluetooth problems​ like you​. OK Google detection never broke for me. I didn't have to replace it or anything like that. And I am happy to be in India because the low stock issue is not here. blueman24 No way I'm buying a 57k phone. Especially when its available in the US for more than 10k cheaper while still being overpriced. Peter Silie Why do you Keep talking about the 128GB version as the version "you and I actually want"? I wouldn't even know what to do with that much space on my phone. I'm on a 32GB N5X with a s**tload of apps installed and a lot of downloaded Play Music titles and I still got 10GB of space. So no, the version I actually want would be the 32GB non-XL Pixel ;-) Alisi Do you play games? Have daydream? I've already had to do the "you don't have to go home, but you can't stay here" dance several times with my 32Gb. Leroy Filon The stock availbabilty is insane. I live in the Netherlands and it's not even out here yet. I drove to Germany back in november to get it. People ask me a lot about my phone when they see my mobile pictures on instagram and i'll tell em it's the Google phone with pride. But it's a shame i can't share this epicnes with fellow owners here in the Netherlands. Michael Sørensen "I rarely really get annoyed using it." Really? "The Bluetooth connectivity sucks. The back of the phone has very obvious wear rub. The glass window scratches easily. It's not waterproof. 'OK Google' hotword detection breaks for no apparent reason, necessitating a reboot (...takes a minut-plus...). The fingerprint scanner is slow..." Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ LMAO... like I said, he didn't even list all of the flaws. If that's the best phone he's ever used, he set the bar incredibly low. I can't even imagine what worse phones he was comparing it to. Maxr1998 Well, G6, S8? They do some things better, but he says the Pixel is better at other things, so in the end it wins. 3223 I dunno about you guys, but from what I read almost all reviewers cannot grasp exactly why it is better than other phones, other than 'it just is'. They can say it is smoother, and faster and all that, but hard data doesn't seem to back up that claim and they rubbish synthetic benchmarks over some abstract claim. I'm starting to see that having a G at the back of the phone, just like an apple logo, may have a placebo effect on its own, bringing people some good vibes, just like nexii phones in the past. Which makes for an interesting read or research as to how brands can affect perception. Jan Ibrahim No. İt's nothing to do with placebo. There are very real significant improvements in touch latency which make a huge difference to your experience. İt's not a commonly spoken about feature or spec, which is why a lot of reviews might not know why the phone feels better. But that's the main thing. 3223 That's the thing. Touch latency is a very common issue on android. And tbh I've been using an HTC 10 which reviewers mentioned when it launched that they tried to reduce touch latency by quite a lot. Additionally if i remember correctly the htc m8 (which i also used before) was regarded as having low touch latency as well. So why is it that when other manufacturers do it, it's kinda swept under the rug but when the goog does it, it becomes the coming of the messiah? You're right though, that there should be more definite tests on touch latency, coz I'll only believe it when I see the numbers.. Theuntje How can you love the camera? Doesn't your main camera sucks in recording video? Looks even like that my front camera is better at capturing video.. Michael Sørensen Can someone please link to a video showing off this legendary fluidity compared to others? Why is it so difficult to actually show when it's apparently oh so obvious? David Newman I'd be interested to see how they compare to the MI Mix, my guess is not very well 🤔 roberto.elena Here is an idea for the next poll: Does David suffer dissociative identity disorder or is he just a troll? 1. Definitely DID 2. Definitely troll. 3. Even if you can, you shouldn't read everything he writes. 4. All he writes, including his personal Twitter, is gospel to me. Peter World Citizen This is the way I see it ... 1. David said don't buy the Pixel now 2. His Google tipster said he/she didn't like what he had said 3. David quickly back pedals with this article :) Kostas 💪🎩 you obviously didn't read it till the end Daishi Or at all... BeholdersEye I don't understand why there is no stereo speakers! Damnit Google, you're​ pushing the damn daydream view vr set then you don't put speakers on top and bottom (left/right in landscape mode), so BS! Google better offer trade-in for upgrade phone! And I certainly don't care for the extremely short software update deadend of only to 2018! We paid big bucks we deserve longer support!!!! Randy Gindy Everyone kind of dropped stereo speakers. Its really been replaced with a half assed version of stereo on some phones. Bottom firing and using the earpiece. username_not_valid I can only assume you havent used any other phone ever then. Nothing else makes logical sense. Jeff This is absolutely one of the worst phones I have ever used. It just had great marketing. For close to $1000 no Ir blaster to control remotes, people complaining about sound distortions, horrible and tedious screenshot capabilities and I don't think it charges fast at all. I'm going back to Samsung as soon as the note 8 is available. Cakefish October can't come soon enough! I need a Pixel 2 for the buttery performance, the amazing camera and the fast updates. Meanwhile, I'm stuck with the Galaxy S7, a great phone no doubt, but one that is showing signs of ageing (oleophobic coating wearing off, a battery that doesn't last as long as it used to and Android updates that come once in a blue moon). glebosotov Nice comment with funny mistype(is that how it's called?). BUTTERY more like battery Alisi Maybe he meant buttery as in smooth? glebosotov Maybe. Anyway, I think that most of us don't speak English as native language, so it's ok Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I don't know if other OEMs have this problem, but I suspect pre-S8, Samsung batteries have been notorious for aging quickly. Even my Note 4 battery died way before it should have. The only good thing is I didn't have to take it to a shop to get it replaced. Patrick Smithopolis The camera and the smooth and consistent performance is why I don't have the urge to get a new phone. someone755 Long-term? Fuck man, it hasn't even been a year. The fact that you need to point out how well it's held over less than half its already limited lifetime can mean only one of two things; Either you're trying to compensate for the fact that the phone isn't as good as you'd hoped it would be (which may or may not be related to its inflated price), or you indeed are a head-over-heels Google fan. For all the shit I defend you against, David, I expected better of you. alcor86 Why the hell don't people put phone cases & screen protectors on their phone? I do that right out the box. Peter Ebenezer I agree, I love the pixel. But every single person I've talked to about it, I've told to not buy it. Purely for the Bluetooth issues. My galaxy S2 I had before this had rock solid Bluetooth but was incredibly old so needed to modernise and was fed up of manufacturers that delay updates by adding bloatware.. The pros outweigh the cons. But the con is a big one... Not to mention the fact they are on about spitting out the next one already... chris My z5 just hit a reboot disaster I picked up a pixel xl 128gb for $950 aus, best phone I've ever used and no dramas with Bluetooth after first week, I was holding out for pixel 2 but didn't make it.. I'm happy with my buy anyway , it's a brilliant phone , buy off eBay not a store and save $300 that's my advice.. What supply issues lol GregAndo Thanks, I have pretty much had every Google phone phone since the Nexus One, and whilst also loved the form factor the Bluetooth issues, Battery issues and OS bugs pushing me to weekly reboots were more than I could handle. So I took the S8+ after the note 7 went back... and skipped the Pixel XL. So glad I did, I had the same issues and they infuriated me in the end. When Google finally gets the build of Android out that focuses out these bugs...I might go back. Tool then i am happy with the S8+ so far, I hope it is more reliable. Keg Man Waiting to hear from the note 7 owners. Most of us thought that was the perfect phone despite the one manufacturing defect Kakairo This matches my experience with the Pixel XL, with the exception of wear and tear (probably due to the slim Spigen case I put on it). With the Bluetooth, though, I wonder if it's an issue with Mazda Connect (I know you drive a Miata, David, I have a Mazda 3). I haven't had any issues with Bluetooth headphones, and I've had two rental Nissans in the past month that worked without issue for over a week. Would I buy it again? Yes, absolutely. Would I buy one right now? No, for the simple fact that the S8 has now surpassed it and that Pixel 2 can't be too far away. sam1331 Uh, the Pixel XL is a big phone. The Pixel is even a big phone, bigger than the iPhone 7 in every single dimension. They sell an iPhone SE that is significantly smaller and people buy it. My point is that, claiming no one should consider the Pixel because the Pixel XL isn't too big isn't an opinion, it's "lunacy". Rod iPhone 7 is 4.7" Andre Meaux Yep! Still love my Pixel (XL)!! Looking for the Pixel XL 2! destinyhud cant wait for the pixel 2. its going to be even more awesome. it will be a day one buy for me Rod There's one thing I wonder about the Pixel: in those PhoneBuff "speed tests" the Pixel is always put to shame when it doesn't hold more than 4 apps in background. However, in this one, it was able to hold 13 apps, being 4 of them, games. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ugcpul8nYg) Who's telling the truth, afterall? mattcoz I had issues with Bluetooth cutting out with my headphones, but then I turned off "phone audio" and it has been perfect. I have noticed that the signal will get weak if I sit on it, but uhh, yeah that makes sense, so I don't do that. Jordan L just this morning, for the first time ever my car would not connect to my Pixel. damn it. Rod David's curse Mike I must have a Pixel XL that is the diamond in the rough. I have a travel job, meaning I'm in rental cars several times a month. I have never once had bluetooth connectivity issues, for real. Henry S. Maybe it's just me but I don't understand this need to go YUuuuuGe with screens anymore. We've reached the point of usability and carrying the damn thing. 5" was the sweet spot for me as a phone. If I want media, I'll watch on my tablet. My perfect phone size was the old Droid MAXX(also a 5" phone). Most of the points make sense. I get the same battery life as you on my OG Pixel except Bluetooth. Only exception is switching between devices on my wife's small Bose speaker and we always have problems no matter the phone so it's not just the Pixel. Xenios Kofteros Got a full refund for my 1.5 year old Nexus 6P for the known battery issues. I'd very much like to buy a Pixel XL, but the price for new and used are ridiculous. Hopefully Google will break tradition and reveal Pixel 2 at Google I/O. Or else I'm going the OnePlus 5 way and break 4 years of Google phone use tradition. ClikFire _ I haven't had any of the issues you mentioned except the issue with hairline scratches because I hate using cases. SoI covered the glass windows with a Matte Black Dbrand Skin and found a Tempered Glass screen bezel which actually transformed the Dark Grey Bezels to true black bezels and covered up the scratches in the process. Also coming from an S7 edge I actually really like the Design of the Pixel personally especially the back with the Glass window, makes it stand out from the rest. If the Pixel 2 looks like this and adds front facing speakers and water resistance I'm game. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/842173829c88496d628fe9ecdf0b77f65995d3ca89cb1a2d93e7896ad2c760f1.png Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ If Google continues the current trend in its phones, it's more likely to look like this. ;) https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/6945f5a7bc54ba27628971ea239b5d6ee5d8f0bb2b8aa844f6e67a2d6ec05c12.png Rod I was about to burst in laughter, then I thought this may actually happen. Ozl Never had any problems with my 128GB Pixel, still works great! krkn I got the Pixel 128GB when it came out because I had a Note7, which I loved, and the XL was unavailable. Despite the smaller size, I have still really enjoyed the phone. Like you said, it remains snappy and the better life good, and sometimes I actually appreciate something that fits in my pocket so nicely. Photos are terrific. My main gripe is the speaker location, which is blocked easily in landscape mode, but that's a small nit since if I really need better sound, I'll be plugged in or using a Bluetooth speaker. Randall Collins I have the XL and I haven't had quite as many issues with mine but it really is a great phone despite all that. No lag, smooth, and the first to get updates with no crazy UI to destroy the experience. And I updated from an iPhone 6+ which had all those same attributes. No phone will ever be perfect but for now, the XL works for me. likurges if the phone was so great as it's bezzels it would be the best phone ever Randy Gindy At least I have something to hold onto when I watch a video. likurges yes because a phone is a heavy thing and doesn't have corners. thank god for the bezels of the pixel. also think for example if you hear some shocking news, you can hold to those bezels and they might as well save your life Randy Gindy Sue me for wanting something to hold without risk of accidentally touching the screen while watching YouTube. Peoples obsession with minimal bezels is just a asinine as Apple's obsession with maker their phones thinner. JR I'd have no problem recommending either of the Pixel devices to potential buyers, today. Many buyers enter the market for a new phone, because they need one. If you're one of those people who only updates their device when the current one is on its last leg, then the Pixel is an outstanding option (six months isn't something many would care to wait). The casual buyer primarily needs a good experience, preferably over a long term, and as discussed in this article, the Pixel delivers this quite well, 'right now' (to be fair, that's *if* you can find one). If the price drops once the Pixel 2 launches, even better. If you're talking to enthusiasts, then we can push this a few ways, but we always have the option to sell the Pixel, should we desire the new shiny thing. The Nexus 6P (still a great phone) fetches nice prices in the aftermarket, and the Pixel is generally understood to be an even better phone. I'm sure the Pixel will command a fine (but lower than new) aftermarket price, and there will always be a set of buyers who can't afford the absolute latest, but will be willing to scoop one up at a more realistic discount. So unless the device is missing game-breaking, hard features you rely on (waterproofing, because you're a part-time lifeguard), then I think it would be acceptable to recommend it. Fastguy77 This article makes no sense. I purchased a pixel brand new for half price, best decision ever. Phone is amazing. So by all means, find someone selling it below MSRP and grab it. Waiting half a year because 'you'll regret' not having the newest is typical tech buyer stupidity. So, just wait and never buy a product, cause around the corner is the next better version... xyz "Is the XL worth $770 to pick up today?" Wasn't worth it even at release!

It turns out Fuchsia has come a long way from the command line form it existed in when it was first uncovered last August. Google has since added an early user interface to its new operating system featuring a card-based design, as can be seen in Ars Techinca’s gallery of images and the video below. First discovered by Kyle Bradshaw at Hotfix, the user interface is called Armadillo and is said to serve as “the default system UI for Fuchsia.” Armadillo (along with, presumably, other forthcoming Fuchsia apps) is built in Google’s Flutter SDK, which is used to create cross-platform code that can run on multiple operating systems like Android, iOS, and apparently Fuchsia. All that adds up to mean that it’s possible to compile Armadillo and run it on an Android device today, giving us our first early look at what Google’s next OS could look like. Photo: Ars Techinca As seen both in Bradshaw’s video and in Ars Technica’s own compiled version of Armadillo, it seems that Fuchsia is a smartphone and tablet-focused operating system, built largely around a card-based system for managing different apps. Armadillo allows for different cards to be dragged around for use in a split-screen or tabbed interface and seems to include some Google Now-style suggestions, too. At this point, there’s no real indication of what Google plans to do with Fuchsia. Is it an actual future operating system that the company is building from the ground up to replace Android and Chrome OS? Some third software platform that will live alongside Google’s existing mobile and desktop offerings? Just an experiment to try out new UI, UX, and development ideas that will never see a real release? It’s still too early to say. But with Google I/O right around the corner, it’s possible we might know more about Fuchsia soon.

Not only will we learn more, but it seems reasonable to believe Google will launch a usable beta for Android O, too. As posted on the Android Beta Program website, the official Nougat beta has concluded, but an official Android O beta is “coming soon.” With this beta program, users can test specific Android features before they are launched to the public. If developers want to work with the latest features or tinkerer Android users want a taste of what’s to come, the Android Beta Program is the place to be. If you can’t wait for the beta, you can download the initial Developer Preview of Android O right here. Here’s what Google has to say about what’s to come. Thank you for your interest in the Android Beta Program! The beta for Android Nougat has concluded, and all devices that were opted in have been updated to the current public version. If you are still running a beta version of Nougat you may download the latest full OTA image for your device and sideload it. This will not wipe your device. We’ll update this site when the Android O Beta Program begins. So long as you have a supported device (Pixel phone or select Nexus devices), anyone can sign up for the Android Beta Program. All you do is enroll your device, then an OTA update will arrive on your phone. After installing, you’re on the beta and Google will update your phone whenever a new beta build is available. It’s pretty sweet, but since it is a beta, stuff may be broken and you should probably have an extra phone laying around just in case. Once this Android O beta is available, we’ll let you know. Via: Google Post navigation Previous StoryGoogle I/O App Updated for 2017 Next StoryDL Q&A Sessions: Volume 46 Mr Trex Would you believe I never had the sound issue till the last up to the public version? Drew_VA Can’t wait. Hoping O will fix some battery issues on my 6p. Pretty sure background processes have been killing it. Also, for some reason it seems like as soon as my phone hits 20% it shuts down instead of going into battery saver mode. If O can get the battery working even marginally better, I should be able to make it through the fall to pick up a discounted Pixel 2, S8, etc. Close to considering it ‘broken’ and paying the insurance copay to get a new 6p to get me through. jim so little difference anymore between the letters , that I doubt many really care ksat So, does this mean those that have enrolled in the Nougat BETA will automatically receive the “O” Beta upon release or do folks need to re-enroll in the Android O Beta Program?? Серёжа Дураков seems to me that we will have to re sign up though it doesn’t explicitly say so. ksat yea – this is not an easy question to find an answer to! Suicide_Note Android O is old news. It’s all about Fuschia now. 😎 DanG Does this mean no more update for N, except the security updates? JSo Android O is the update for N.

Just got a Pixel to replace my aging N6P. VAVAMk_2 Pixel 2 to replace my 6P (which I still love BTW) Jeff718 Yeah I’ve been a Nexus user since the Galaxy Nexus. I thought I’d try something new and while I like it a lot, the Pixel program has perks I like. Rod Imagine when you see the news that Android O rollout has started for Pixel devices… Lol Jeff718 I’d wager the first new phone with O will be the Pixel 2 and I’m pretty sure I’ll jump on board. Rod So, you got a U$800 phone to use for mere 5 months? Jeff718 It was $850, and more like 6-7 months, yes. New phones are my thing, what I like to do and spend my money on. Rod So, you’ll likely drop the Pixel 2 for the S9 next year again? TheDocB Yep! Jeff718 I don’t know yet, I need to see the features of the Pixel​ 2 and the S9.

However, the Amazon Echo devices are becoming so popular that a new report claims Google Home is behind by a 3-to-1 margin in market share. The report states by the end of 2017, Echo products will hold more than a 70% market share with Google lagging behind at almost 24%. The report also claims that the “number active US users will more than double” in 2017, bringing the total number of users up to more than 35 million. This is where reports like these begin to get a bit weird as we are expecting some type of Google Home announcement at Google I/O 2017. It’s doubtful that we’ll see a full replacement for the current Home, but it would be awesome to see a smaller product to take on the likes of the Amazon Echo Dot. Finally, Reuters is reporting that the software and technology used in the Google Home is actually better than that of the competition. However, with the original Amazon Echo being launched back in 2014, Google has a lot of work to do in order to catch up. Google I/O 2017 is a little more than a week away, so maybe Google will be able to respond with new products to take some of that market share away from Amazon. Regardless, the attempts may be futile as Amazon is likely nearing the launch of an all-new Echo device, complete with a touchscreen display.

Photo: AFP Seattle: Amazon.com Inc. will dominate Google in the voice-activated speaker market for the next few years due to the early breakout success of its Echo speaker, according to a forecast from research firm EMarketer Inc. More than 35 million Americans will speak to these internet-connected speakers at least once a month this year, more than double the number in 2016, with tech-savvy millennials leading adoption, the EMarketer said in its first forecast of the burgeoning market. About 71% will use Echo devices, with the Google Home speaker trailing at 24%. Amazon will remain the dominant player for the next couple of years, even as Google narrows the gap, because it got such an early lead, EMarketer analyst Martin Utreras said. “Consumers are becoming increasingly comfortable with the technology, which is driving engagement,” he added. “As prices decrease and functionality increases, consumers are finding more reasons to increase adoption.” ALSO READ: 4 apps that remind you to eat and hydrate Indeed, a separate study released Monday shows Amazon’s $50 Echo Dot, the cheapest version of the speaker, is helping boost adoption. The low-cost Dot, which Amazon introduced last year, is enticing consumers to try the technology. The model represents more than half of the 10.7 million Echo devices sold since they were introduced, according to a report by Consumer Intelligence Research Partners. “The Echo Dot definitely helped drive Echo sales since the release of the second generation model in October 2016,” said Josh Lowitz, co-founder of the research firm. “Amazon priced it aggressively, offered big discounts during the holiday season, and offered promotions for purchasing multiple units to encourage gifting and multi-room home use.” Amazon unveiled the Echo, a cylindrical speaker that lets users stream music, dim lights, and order pizza by voice, in 2014. The devices cost as much as $200 and have become a surprise hit for a company that had struggled with some of its other consumer hardware efforts. Alphabet Inc.’s Google answered with its $115 Home device two years later. The gadgets target the house, when people might not have a smartphone handy and where portability isn’t an issue. Voice-based assistants, such as Apple Inc.’s Siri, are commonly accessed via smartphones. Amazon will “double down” on its investments in Echo devices and the underlying Alexa voice-activated system this year, CFO Brian Olsavsky said on a recent earnings call. The company in April announced the latest Echo variation, called the Echo Look, a $200 hands-free camera designed for dressing rooms that takes photos and video on voice command so users can assess their outfits from every angle. The device also lets users submit photos of two outfits to get a recommendation on the best one. The company will soon unveil a new Echo that features a display.Bloomberg Spencer Soper Topics: Amazon Echo speaker Google Home speaker Alexa Echo Look More From Livemint READ MORE Venture capitalists beware: Chinese factories may eat your lunch Supreme Court sends fresh Aadhaar plea to larger Constitution bench India’s highway expansion opens up market for global bitumen producers First Published: Mon, May 08 2017. 10 26 PM IST Editor's Picks Gear up for supply chain disruption after GST implementation Questions raised by the NPA ordinance SBI cuts home loan rates in affordable housing push Latest News Venture capitalists beware: Chinese factories may eat your lunch Supreme Court sends fresh Aadhaar plea to larger Constitution bench India’s highway expansion opens up market for global bitumen producers VCs put $110 million into software that checks grammar Review: CAT S60 epitomizes ruggedness, and is meant for more than WhatsApp chats Mint On Sunday 1965 Nanda Devi spy mission, the movie Meeting Lucy in Ethiopia, and other travel stories from the cradle of humanity The Universe of the Mantra Secrets of the world’s biggest gin collection The Tao of thinking Home Companies Opinion Industry Politics Consumer Lounge Multimedia Money Sitemap Subscribe Contact Us Mint Code Privacy policy Terms of Use Advertising Mint Apps About Us Syndication Mint on Sunday RSS Hindustan Times Desimartini Copyright © 2017 HT Media Ltd.

Almost everything they publish is “bogus,” explains science writer Richard Harris, who writes for NPR, and the result is billions of dollars in fraud, waste and unnecessary expenditures on Big Pharma drugs that simple don’t work. His new book is called Rigor Mortis: How Sloppy Science Creates Worthless Cures, Crushes Hope, and Wastes Billions, and it reveals the truth about science fraud that I’ve been documenting for years on Natural News and Scientific.news. What truth is that? Most “science” studies don’t hold up under scrutiny, and most of them can’t be reproduced when someone else attempts to perform the same experiment. The entire apparatus of Big Pharma and FDA approved drugs, in other words, is largely fraudulent. Most drugs simply don’t work on most people, which is exactly why people who take lots of prescription medications almost always see a decline in their health (they get sicker, not healthier). The bogus nature of bad science is present across every realm of science, by the way: Pharmaceuticals, climate change, psychology, physics, chemistry and more. Climate change is probably the worst of all these, where scientists decide in advance what outcomes they want to see, then work diligently to shape the computer modeling or data sets to achieve the outcome they want. In fact, the entire industry of “climate change science” is rooted in total junk science fraud, buoyed by fabricated science and aggressive demands of social conformity (plus coordinated attempts to smear and discredit any scientists who don’t kowtow to the science totalitarians). What’s especially notable in all this is that medical science studies are almost always given instant credibility of “real news” even when they are demonstrably fake. Thus, Google’s war on “fake news” will censor information that questions the legitimacy of the faked science studies because Google automatically assumes all medical journals are 100% real and correct at all times. The far more accurate answer is that they are probably only accurate about 1% of the time, which means they’re 99% fake news that Google scores as 100% real. (See more news about Google’s disinformation schemes at Disinfo.news.) The New York Post has published an outstanding article summarizing the sad state of science today. Read the original article at the New York Post website: Medical studies are almost always bogus By Susannah Cahalan How many times have you encountered a study — on, say, weight loss — that trumpeted one fad, only to see another study discrediting it a week later? That’s because many medical studies are junk. It’s an open secret in the research community, and it even has a name: “the reproducibility crisis.” For any study to have legitimacy, it must be replicated, yet only half of medical studies celebrated in newspapers hold water under serious follow-up scrutiny — and about two-thirds of the “sexiest” cutting-edge reports, including the discovery of new genes linked to obesity or mental illness, are later “disconfirmed.” Though erring is a key part of the scientific process, this level of failure slows scientific progress, wastes time and resources and costs taxpayers excesses of $28 billion a year, writes NPR science correspondent Richard Harris in his book “Rigor Mortis: How Sloppy Science Creates Worthless Cures, Crushes Hope, and Wastes Billions” (Basic Books). “When you read something, take it with a grain of salt,” Harris tells The Post. “Even the best science can be misleading, and often what you’re reading is not the best science.” Take one particularly enraging example: For many years research on breast cancer was conducted on misidentified melanoma cells, which means that thousands of papers published in credible scientific journals were actually studying the wrong cancer. “It’s impossible to know how much this sloppy use of the wrong cells has set back research into breast cancer,” writes Harris. Another study claimed to have invented a blood test that could detect ovarian cancer — which would mean much earlier diagnosis. The research was hailed as a major breakthrough on morning shows and in newspapers. Further scrutiny, though, revealed the only reason the blood test “worked” was because the researchers tested the two batches on two separate days — all the women with ovarian cancer on one day, and without the disease the next. Instead of measuring the differences in the cancer, the blood test had, in fact, measured the day-to-day differences in the machine. So why are so many tests bogus? Harris has some thoughts. For one, science is hard. Everything from unconscious bias — the way researchers see their data through the rosy lens of their own theses — to the types of beaker they use or the bedding that they keep mice in can cloud results and derail reproducibility. Then there is the funding issue. During the heyday of the late ’90s and early aughts, research funding increased until Congress decided to hold funding flat for the next decade, creating an atmosphere of intense, some would say unhealthy, competition among research scientists. Now only 17 percent of grants get funded (compared to a third three decades ago). Add this to the truly terrible job market for post-docs — only 21 percent land tenure track jobs — and there is a greater incentive to publish splashy counterintuitive studies, which have a higher likelihood of being wrong, writes Harris. One effect of this “pressure to publish” situation is intentional data manipulation, where scientists cherry-pick the information that supports a hypothesis while ignoring the data that doesn’t — an all too common problem in academic research, writes Harris. “There’s a constant scramble for research dollars. Promotions and tenure depend on making splashy discoveries. There are big rewards for being first, even if the work ultimately fails the test of time,” writes Harris.

Adams is also highly proficient in running liquid chromatography, ion chromatography and mass spectrometry time-of-flight analytical instrumentation. He has also achieved numerous laboratory breakthroughs in the programming of automated liquid handling robots for sample preparation and external standards prep. The U.S. patent office has awarded Mike Adams patent NO. US 9526751 B2 for the invention of “Cesium Eliminator,” a lifesaving invention that removes up to 95% of radioactive cesium from the human digestive tract. Adams has pledged to donate full patent licensing rights to any state or national government that needs to manufacture the product to save human lives in the aftermath of a nuclear accident, disaster, act of war or act of terrorism. He has also stockpiled 10,000 kg of raw material to manufacture Cesium Eliminator in a Texas warehouse, and plans to donate the finished product to help save lives in Texas when the next nuclear event occurs. No independent scientist in the world has done more research on the removal of radioactive elements from the human digestive tract. Adams is a person of color whose ancestors include Africans and American Indians. He is of Native American heritage, which he credits as inspiring his “Health Ranger” passion for protecting life and nature against the destruction caused by chemicals, heavy metals and other forms of pollution. Adams is the founder and publisher of the open source science journal Natural Science Journal, the author of numerous peer-reviewed science papers published by the journal, and the author of the world’s first book that published ICP-MS heavy metals analysis results for foods, dietary supplements, pet food, spices and fast food. The book is entitled Food Forensics and is published by BenBella Books. In his laboratory research, Adams has made numerous food safety breakthroughs such as revealing rice protein products imported from Asia to be contaminated with toxic heavy metals like lead, cadmium and tungsten. Adams was the first food science researcher to document high levels of tungsten in superfoods. He also discovered over 11 ppm lead in imported mangosteen powder, and led an industry-wide voluntary agreement to limit heavy metals in rice protein products. In addition to his lab work, Adams is also the (non-paid) executive director of the non-profit Consumer Wellness Center (CWC), an organization that redirects 100% of its donations receipts to grant programs that teach children and women how to grow their own food or vastly improve their nutrition. Through the non-profit CWC, Adams also launched Nutrition Rescue, a program that donates essential vitamins to people in need. Click here to see some of the CWC success stories.

Name: Subject: Message: Google’s mystery OS Fuchsia now has a smartphone and tablet UI Newsby John Callaham14 hours ago 10 777 31 Several months ago, it was revealed that Google was working on a new and mysterious project called “Fuchsia”. It was a new operating system that dumped the Linux-based kernel used in Google’s Android OS in favor of a new one called Magenta. Our own Gary Sims managed to download and run the Fuchsia OS, but in that early stage, it was just a bunch of command lines. Now a report says that Google has continued to work on Fuchsia, and has now thrown in a new user interface for smartphones and tablets. The UI has has the code name Armadillo. This development means that, if you have the technical savvy, you can download the OS source and the UI, compile it into an Android APK and run it, in theory, on your Android device. See also: Is Google’s Fuchsia OS the key to merge Android and Chrome OS or not? February 15, 2017 According to Ars Technica, the Fuchsia UI shows a home screen that’s formatted to work like a vertically scrolling list, with your profile picture, the current date, your current location, and a battery icon in the center. Above your profile are what are labeled as Story cards, which apparently show your recently opened apps. Below your profile, the UI shows a scrolling list of suggestions for your day. A home button shows up at the bottom when you leave this screen. Some of the other interesting features that have been reported in the Fuchsia UI include the ability to place apps on top of each other by long pressing on one of them. Some of the other interesting features that have been reported in the Fuchsia UI include the ability to place apps on top of each other by long pressing on one of them. This will also start a split-screen mode that can currently be configured a number of ways. It allows for two apps to be split vertically or horizontally equally or you can add in a third app that will also show an equal split in both directions, or you can split two in half next to a full-height app. The keyboard UI for the Fuchsia OS is one that’s not based on the current Android keyboard, and it includes a dark theme. Below it are the operating system’s version of Android’s Google Now suggestion cards. Keep in mind that even if you get this UI to load, it won’t actually work in terms of launching apps and other features; all of these elements are placeholders. Want to see Fuchsia’s new UI in action? Check out the video attached below, courtesy of Kyle Bradshaw (HotFix.net). The article speculates that since Fuchsia’s Armadillo UI is written with the cross-platform Flutter SDK, it could allow Android app developers to quickly port their older apps to work on Fuchsia, and thus offering a transition from Android to this OS. So far, Google has not said very much about their plans for Fuchsia, including if it will be a replacement for Android. It’s also more than possible that this project could be canceled as quickly as it appeared in 2016. However, at the moment, it seems like Google is moving forward. It’s more than possible that we will get additional information on their Fuchsia plans next week as part of its Google I/O developer conference.

Mobile phones Samsung’s over-sized Galaxy S8 Plus is a smartphone to be reckoned with Jonathan Bray @jon1bray 8 May 2017 whatsapp facebook twitter google+ linkedin reddit email Image 1 of 19 4 £766.78fromAmazon Price when reviewed  779 In some senses, the Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus doesn’t really deserve its own review. It’s much the same as the Samsung Galaxy S8, which you can read Alan’s full review of here. It has the same features as its (slightly) smaller sibling; the same internals, camera, storage options, and screen aspect ratio and resolution. What makes it different, of course, is the sheer size of the thing. The Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus’ screen measures 6.2in across the diagonal. This would make a regular phone practically unusable – but the Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus is no regular phone. That’s mainly because the 18.5:9 aspect ratio allows Samsung to add extra screen real estate without expanding the physical width of the phone too much. This means the S8 is actually no less usable than the Huawei Mate 8 I spent three months with last year. Indeed, it feels quite comfortable to hold and use in one hand, which is quite the surprise. READ NEXT: Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus UK deals Image 3 of 19 Looking objectively at the numbers, though, this should come as no real surprise. The Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus is a mere 73.4mm wide, which works out at only 0.8mm broader than last year’s S7 Edge. It’s noticeably taller at 159.5mm (compared with 150.9mm for the S7 Edge), but thanks to incredibly narrow top and bottom screen bezels, it isn’t as unwieldy as it could have been. Despite this, the Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus is still not the most pocketable of smartphones. Despite the narrow bezel, this phone is taller than the Google Pixel XL by nearly half a centimetre and it’s pretty hefty, too, at 173g. You’ll need to plan on keeping it in a jacket pocket – or get handy with a needle and thread and add extensions to your jeans pockets. In terms of practicality and looks, these are pretty much the only differences between the Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus and the regular S8. They’re both available in the same range of colours – silver, blue and black – and both look and feel glorious. There’s Gorilla Glass 5 on both the front and rear, although the lack of bezels means it probably will smash if you drop it anyway. It’s IP68 dust- and water-resistant, though, so when you get caught out in a rain shower or drop it down the toilet, it should continue to work. Samsung S8 Plus UK SIM-Free Smartphone - Midnight Black £766.78 Buy now Just like its little brother, the S8 Plus also has a microSD slot, and it has a fingerprint reader that’s been repositioned at the rear as well. That’s poor positioning, in my view, because it means you frequently smudge the camera lens with your finger trying to locate it. At least there are other ways to unlock the phone, although both the iris recognition and new facial recognition are less convenient to use because you have to lift up the phone to engage them. However, there’s no denying that this is one handsome smartphone, largely due to the lack of bezels and the gorgeous curved edges that run up the S8 Plus’ flanks. No other smartphone looks this good; it’s a pleasure to pick up, use, stroke and fondle – a jewel of a smartphone that’s one step ahead of the rest of the market. Image 6 of 19 Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus review: Performance and display Performance-wise – yep, you guessed it – the Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus offers much the same as the regular S8, which means to say it’s superfast. You get a 10nm Samsung Exynos 8895 (or Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 if you live in the US) and this is paired with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of UFS 2 storage. Above are the benchmark graphs for your reference. As you can see, the Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus matches the regular S8 test for test – hardly surprising given the identical internals. The Galaxy S8’s display, too, is just what you’d expect from Samsung, which has become a pass master in this area in recent years. It’s an AMOLED panel, so it has perfect black and its performance in every test we put it through was superb. Samsung S8 Plus UK SIM-Free Smartphone - Midnight Black £766.78 Buy now Colours are perfectly poised – not oversaturated yet still vibrant – and it goes just as bright as you need it to. We usually measure brightness by switching off auto-brightness and then sliding the adjustment all the way up to the maximum; however, with Samsung phones, the maximum brightness can only be achieved by enabling auto-brightness and placing the phone in high ambient light. In these conditions, with a full white screen, the Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus is able to push screen brightness up from a maximum of 347cd/m2 to 554cd/m2, which means it will be bright enough to read in most conditions. That’s still not the full story, however. Since the screen is HDR Premium certified, it should be able to reach higher peak brightness than this and so it proves. With only a small patch of white pixels displayed on the screen, the S8 Plus pushes peak brightness up to a searing 912cd/m2. Image 4 of 19 It’s one hell of a display, then, but there are practical issues to contend with. That long-tall screen aspect ratio (or short-wide, depending on how you look at it) means that not all apps and content adapt perfectly. I came across a number of games during testing that left thick black borders at the top and bottom of the screen and, when you turn the phone on its side, it’s a similar situation with movie and TV content. While YouTube and Samsung’s own video player let you stretch content to fit the wide screen, other apps don’t yet offer the option to do this. Fire up a movie on Netflix, for instance, and you’ll have to put up with black bars to the left and right, with no way to either zoom or stretch the video to fill the screen; perhaps we’ll just have to be patient on this front, but at the moment it’s a little disappointing. The one area of performance where the Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus has the potential to be different from the regular S8 is battery life. With a larger 3,500mAh capacity, you’d expect stamina to be longer, although there is the compensating factor of that larger screen. Image 4 of 19 Anecdotally, this is a long-lasting phone. I’ve been using it for around a week now, and I regularly get longer than a full day out of it. If I go to bed, having taken it off charge at around 6.30am, it will typically still be running the next morning if I forget to plug it in overnight. This is with moderate use: no heavy-duty gaming, GPS or VR. Our video-playback battery test backs up this experience. With the phone set to its default screen resolution (1,080 x 2,220), the screen calibrated to 170cd/m2 and flight mode engaged, the Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus lasted 20hrs 33mins before running dry. That’s a pretty decent result, and places it a long way ahead of the Google Pixel XL, LG G6 and the regular S8. Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus review: Cameras On paper, the rear camera isn’t much to shout about. It has the same resolution as last year’s Samsung flagships, remaining at 12 megapixels, and the secondary specifications are a match as well, with optical image stabilisation, dual-pixel autofocus and a bright aperture of f/1.7. The only difference on paper is that the camera, via the S8 Plus’ ISP (image signal processor), captures not one but three frames in rapid succession every time you shoot, combining them together in a bid to create sharper images. It’s like HDR for every shot you take and is Samsung’s attempt to match the Google Pixel phone’s HDR+ technique, which captures up to ten images and combines them in a similar way. What effect does this have on captured images? Surprisingly – as with the S8 – it improves things significantly over the S7 and, in good light, the S8’s images compare well with the Pixel’s. The main difference is not in detail capture, but exposure, where the Pixel captures much more naturalistic images than the Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus, which has a tendency to slightly overexpose and oversaturate images. I also noticed in a couple of examples that the S8 Plus is applying significantly more noticeable sharpening than the Pixel. This is evident only on very close inspection, but it means that the S8 Plus’ images, in some circumstances, can look sharper. Image 18 of 19 ^ The Pixel XL on the left produces more balanced, natural-looking shots than the S8 Plus, which has a tendency to blow out highlights Image 13 of 19 ^ There's a more yellowy, over-saturated look to the S8's shot (right), where again the Pixel produces more realistic images In low light, however, the win goes more clearly to the Pixel XL. Its pictures look a little grainier than the Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus’ images, but that means it’s better at retaining details. Once again, there’s slightly more naturalist colour capture as well. The Google Pixel is clearly still the king of smartphone photography. Image 19 of 19 ^ In this low-light image, the Google Pixel XL (left) gets white balance under fluorescent lighting spot on while the S8 Plus' image is slightly too yellow. Close inspection also shows the Pixel's shot to be grainier, but slightly better in terms of detail preservation If you value your front-facing camera as much as your rear, though, you’ll be very satisfied with the S8 Plus’ snapper. It has a much better selfie camera than the S7 Edge (8 megapixels vs 5 megapixels), although it's again a close-run thing with the Google Pixel XL. The S8 Plus’ f/1.7 aperture lets in much more light than the Pixel’s f/2.4, but the Pixel tends to exposure images more accurately and ends up capturing more natural-looking snaps as a result. Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus review: Software, Bixby and DeX The Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus runs Android 7 Nougat, which is hardly surprising, and this is overlaid with the usual Samsung launcher software. You might find this intrusive, with its slightly different icons and laundry list of extra features, but I don’t. It’s different, but not unpleasantly so, and although there’s quite a long list of preinstalled apps, the 64GB standard storage allocation and microSD slot mean this isn’t the problem it might have been. The big selling point of this particular iteration of Samsung’s software is supposed to be Bixby – the firm’s answer to Alexa and Siri – but the voice-driven part of it isn’t ready yet and what we do have is not all that exciting. There’s an automatically curated feed of personalised news and info to the left of the homescreen that looks uncannily like the Google Now, and Bixby Vision – a plugin for the camera that analyses what you’re pointing the lens at and attempts to provide useful information, be that shopping links for products or information on people and landmarks. Image 8 of 19 I can’t see myself bothering with either of these in the long run, but since I’m reviewing the phone, I’ve been taking the opportunity to test the features out over the past few days. I can’t say I’ve been impressed. The newsfeed works well enough, but I can see no practical reason for reinventing what Google Now does. Bixby Vision is of little to no use at all. The shopping aspect I could never get to work; nothing I pointed it at brought up any kind of recognised product. The image recognition was patchy at best. A photo of the BT Tower matched a bunch of towers across the world, but a snap of my face brought up wildly inaccurate match list, topped by a story about Robbie Williams. I’m not sure if I should be offended by that or flattered. The Place option seems the most useful, but how many times are you going to find yourself in a place wanting to know something about a building that looks famous? I’m guessing not often. Samsung S8 Plus UK SIM-Free Smartphone - Midnight Black £766.78 Buy now Image 9 of 19 Samsung DeX, on the other hand, is considerably more impressive. This is Samsung’s answer to Microsoft Continuum: slot the phone into the DeX dock (a rather costly £129 extra), connect a keyboard, mouse and monitor, and you’ll be able to use your phone to run a complete windowed desktop environment. It’s surprisingly snappy and capable, too. I was able to work perfectly happily on just the phone for almost a whole day – until I needed to use Photoshop to do some RAW file editing. It’s certainly a big improvement on Microsoft’s rather sluggish effort. Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus review: Verdict In essence, the Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus is the same phone as the S8, with all the things that make that phone great, but with a bigger screen, a bigger battery, a more unwieldy profile and a higher price. Is it any better, though? In my view, the answer to that question has to be no, and that’s mainly due to the 6.2in Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus’ size: it’s just one step too far. Although it isn’t over-wide, it’s too tall and although I’d be happy to carry around the regular Samsung Galaxy S8 in my pocket day to day, the Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus doesn’t quite get it right in the same way. We’ve been here before with big phones, of course. I remember reviewing my first 4.5in smartphone and thinking that ludicrously big at the time, so my opinion might change (as long as my pockets do at the same time). Of course, you do get better battery life than the Galaxy S8 as well. But given the choice, and considering the price differential – the Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus costs a hefty £779 to the S8’s £679 – the Samsung Galaxy S8 is the phone to choose from this pair.

The vulnerability was discovered by Natalie Silvanovich and Tavis Ormandy from Google’s Project Zero, a team of hackers that tries to find vulnerabilities in widely used software in order to protect internet users. I think @natashenka and I just discovered the worst Windows remote code exec in recent memory. This is crazy bad. Report on the way. 🔥🔥🔥 — Tavis Ormandy (@taviso) May 6, 2017 Ormandy tweets that the vulnerability is, “the worst Windows remote code exec in recent memory. This is crazy bad”. In another tweet he added, “attack works against a default install, don’t need to be on the same LAN, and it’s wormable.” While Ormandy and Silvanovich don’t provide many more details, they have announced to release a report with details later. This will likely be in about 3 months, as it’s Google policy to give software vendors a 90 day security disclosure deadline to patch their products and disclose it to the public. Earlier this year Google’s Project Zero also disclosed unpatched vulnerabilities in Windows.

The list includes many well-known auto companies — Ford, General Motors, BMW, Honda — and the tech companies you’d expect, including Apple and Google.  Also permitted, a number of lesser-known companies, like Navya, Nuro and Zoox. All are chasing the same goal: a consumer-ready, self-driving-car solution. There are many smart people working on the technology, so if you subscribe to Moore’s Law, get ready, the technology will happen.      ADVERTISEMENT The challenge, however, is likely not simply a technical one. It’s also a people problem. That is why we're particularly intrigued when John Krafcik, president of Waymo —  formerly known as the Google self-driving car project — posted a story on Medium inviting people to be part of his company’s early rider program in Phoenix.    With that simple post, Phoenix quickly became ground zero in the race to self-driving cars. It’s a smart, strategic location given its perfect weather and nearly pristine road conditions. Phoenix has an annual temperature of 75 degrees, with only 36 days of rain. In one study a few years back, Phoenix had a “Pothole Index” rating of just 18.7, the lowest of 13 Western regions, with nearby Tucson coming in nearly eight-times worse at 145.8. While Phoenix won’t address the challenges of mixing autonomous vehicles with sloppy weather, it’s a good place to start. There will be time for bad-weather testing.   The Phoenix program is proof Waymo’s Krafcik, a charismatic, auto industry veteran, understands adoption of self-driving cars poses not one, but two significant challenges:    1. The practical problem: The technology has to work safely and consistently. 2. The people problem: Consumers (and regulating organizations) have to accept it. Frankly, solving the people problem is the more difficult of the two, even though — let’s be honest — the practical one is practically impossible. Waymo, however, as part of Google/Alphabet, is uniquely positioned to successfully navigate both self-driving challenges. The practical takes money and knowhow; the people problem involves something more elusive: trust. Even above Tesla, which is both a tech company and a car manufacturer, Google is in an enviable position.  People don’t “touch” Tesla every day as they do Google, where trust is already established. From the most mundane question — “What’s the weather today?” — to the most challenging — “What’s the meaning of life?” — people already trust Google to solve both practical and emotional problems. Consumer acceptance of self-driving technology will only happen with trust. Cox Automotive, through its brands Kelley Blue Book and Autotrader, has undertaken multiple surveys to gauge consumer awareness and acceptance of autonomous technology and self-driving vehicles. On both fronts — awareness and acceptance — there is building momentum. In a study released this past January, 56 percent of millennial consumers indicated they’d be comfortable riding in a self-driving car.   The studies also show luxury owners are nearly twice as comfortable with the idea of self-driving vehicles, thanks in large part to the exposure of enabling technologies — adaptive cruise control, lane-keeping systems, automatic emergency braking, etc. This indicates that consumer experience with highly-automated vehicles will be a key step in increasing awareness and acceptance of a self-driving future.   Considering the social media opportunities with their Phoenix effort — selfies in the self-driving car — Waymo’s undertaking is an important next step in the march to a future driven by self-driving technology.  Of course, it’s important to remember that comfort and familiarity doesn’t necessarily lead to personal adoption. Many taxi fleets are filled with hybrid vehicles, but that hasn’t led to consumers going home and purchasing one for their driveway.  But you have to start somewhere, so full kudos to Waymo for attacking both sides of the equation. Self-driving technology could eventually save thousands of lives and provide transportation for an aging population, not to mention unimagined opportunities for the physically and mentally challenged among us. Self-driving cars is a game-changer. It’s a cause worth pursuing.   Rebecca Lindland is executive analyst for Kelley Blue Book, the most trusted resource for car shopping.

Join For Free Download Microservices for Java Developers: A hands-on introduction to frameworks and containers. Brought to you in partnership with Red Hat. Sometimes you are just plain lazy and would rather have Maven create the Java files out of .proto. The alternative would have been to download the protoc, fire up the terminal and issue one simple command. Not a big deal at all. But as I said sometimes you are just plain lazy. So how do you go about it? Follow the steps given below. Think up a super critical message that you want to send across over the wire. If you don't know how to write a .proto file, perhaps one of the links below would help. https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3 Below is the super critical hello world that I want to send across. Create Your Message syntax = "proto2";

// This is the package where the java source code will be placed. 
option java_package = "le.arn";

// This is the name of the class. 
// If not provided, it will be created as <message name>OuterClass. 
option java_outer_classname = "GreetingProtos";

message Greeting {
  required string greeting = 1;
  
} Maven Create a vanilla Maven project.  Say thanks to open source and add protoc-jar-maven-plugin to the project.  <!-- protobuf. (de)serialize proto buffers using java api. -->
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.google.protobuf</groupId>
  <artifactId>protobuf-java</artifactId>
  <version>3.2.0</version>
</dependency> This would create the Java files. Add the Protobuf Libraries However, they will complain that the Google libraries are not around.  So you will have to add the protobuf libraries.  <!-- compile proto file into java files. -->
<plugin>
    <groupId>com.github.os72</groupId>
    <artifactId>protoc-jar-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>3.2.0.1</version>
    <executions>
        <execution>
            <phase>generate-sources</phase>
            <goals>
                <goal>run</goal>
            </goals>
            <configuration>
                <!-- <includeDirectories> <include>src/main/protobuf</include> </includeDirectories> -->

                    <include>src/main/protobuf</include>
                </inputDirectories>
                <!-- Create java files. And put them in the src/main/java directory. -->
                <outputTargets>
                    <outputTarget>
                        <type>java</type>
                        <outputDirectory>src/main/java</outputDirectory>
                    </outputTarget>
                </outputTargets>
            </configuration>
        </execution>
    </executions>
</plugin> The proof of the pudding is in eating it.  Testing Let's write a test to serialize and deserialize the super critical message. // 1 : Create a Greeting object using the Protobuf builder.
Builder greetingBuilder = GreetingProtos.Greeting.newBuilder();
greetingBuilder.setGreeting(HELLO_WORLD);
Greeting greeting = greetingBuilder.build();
try {
    // 2 : Write the message into a file. Serialize the object.
    FileOutputStream output = new FileOutputStream(SER_FILE);
    greeting.writeTo(output);
    output.close();
    // 3 : Deserialize the object from the file.
    Greeting greetingFromFile = Greeting.parseFrom(new FileInputStream(
        SER_FILE));
    logger.debug("We read this from the file {}", greetingFromFile);
    // 4 : All is well?
    assertEquals(HELLO_WORLD, greetingFromFile.getGreeting());
} catch (IOException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
} That's it. You have a Java project that does the basic steps, i.e. serialization/deserialization, using protobuf. I hope that is helpful. If you know an easier, quicker way, please share it as well.  Either way, your comments will be appreciated.

First, it was the humble e-reader. Now, it’s the voice-controlled speaker. The e-commerce giant holds a 70.6% market share in the new category, which it invented with the Amazon Echo in 2014, according to research from eMarketer. The report suggests that Google is poised to take more of the market in 2017, but that Amazon will still lead by a wide margin. More Americans also are expected to start using the virtual personal assistants, whether they are in home speakers like the Echo or Google Home, or functioning as part of cellphones or other products. Researchers say 60.5 million Americans will use Amazon’s Alexa, Google Now, Microsoft’s Cortana, or Apple’s Siri at least once per month in 2017, a 23.1% increase over last year. That equates to one-fifth of the people who use smartphones. Unsurprisingly, millennials are credited with driving virtual personal assistant adoption, with just over one-third of the generation predicted to use one this year. For Amazon, this is great news. The company has recently began a campaign to make Alexa synonymous with voice assistants: Other developers can now use Alexa in their own applications, and the virtual personal assistant was shoe-horned into dozens of products on display at this year’s Consumer Electronics Show. Amazon’s market share in voice-controlled speakers mirrors its success in another business, e-books. Reports indicate that Amazon, blamed with contributing to the downfall of physical book stores like Borders, now enjoys a 74% of the e-book market.

Amazon to control 70 percent of the voice-controlled speaker market this year Posted 14 hours ago by Sarah Perez (@sarahintampa) 0 SHARES Next Story The Nixie Machine II is a mean-looking clock for serious geeks Amazon is dominating the voice-controlled speaker market, according to a new forecast from eMarketer out this morning. The maker of the Echo-branded speakers will have 70.6 percent of all voice-enabled speaker users in the U.S. this year – well ahead of Google Home’s 23.8 percent and other, smaller players like Lenovo, LG, Harmon Kardon, and Mattel, who combined only account for 5.6 percent of users. The new report backs up another from VoiceLabs released in January, which also found that Amazon was leading the voice-first device market, thanks to Echo’s popularity. While the market itself is not expected to be a winner-take-all scenario, competitors like Amazon and Google will win entire homes, as most consumers have said they wouldn’t consider buying a competing device once they already own one voice-controlled speaker. Emarketer says Amazon’s share will fall somewhat as Google gets its Home devices into more consumers’ hands, but Amazon will lead the market for the “foreseeable future.” This year, 35.6 million Americans will use a voice-activated device at least once per month, the firm estimates – a 128.9 percent over 2016. (The company is not counting voice assistants on smartphones in this part of its forecast – only those digital assistants on standalone voice-enabled speakers.) However, the wider voice assistant market – which includes Siri, Alexa, Google Now and Microsoft’s Cortana operating on any device –  is expected to grow 23.1 percent this year, eMarketer says. In 2017, 60.5 million U.S. users will use one of these assistants at least once per month. That’s over a quarter (27.5%) of smartphone users, or nearly one in five Americans, the report notes. Usage is heaviest among a younger demographic – those between 25 and 34, make up 26.3 percent of virtual assistant users. In addition, more than one-third of millennials (33.5%) will use virtual assistants in 2017. “Older millennials are the core users of virtual assistants, mainly due to their demand for functionality over entertainment,” eMarketer’s VP of Forecasting, Martín Utreras, says. Amazon doesn’t disclose Echo sales figures, but said in February that Echo family sales are up over 9x compared to last season. VoiceLabs estimated in January there are over 7 million devices in customers’ homes; Consumer Intelligence Research Partners (CIRP) around the same time put it higher at 8.2 million; and Morgan Stanley believes it was over 11 million before the 2017 holidays. Amazon’s strategy with Alexa is to allow the assistant to extend beyond just voice-controlled speakers it manufacturers. The company has also included the assistant in its Amazon mobile shopping app, and has made it available to third-parties for use in their own hardware and software applications. With its dominant market share, Amazon’s Alexa could bring in $10 billion in revenue by 2020, RBC Capital Markets had also estimated in March. This figure included Alexa device sales, voice shopping sales, and platform revenue. The firm forecasted there will be 60 million Alexa devices sold in 2020, bringing the install base to 128 million. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Alexa Description Alexa is an intelligent personal assistant developed by Amazon.com's Lab126 and made popular by the Echo.

Uber was drawn to Toronto because the city has been "at the forefront" of AI research. Share on Facebook A A Report an Error Share via Email Print Erica Edwards / Uber Canada Raquel Urtasun, a U of T computer science professor, will lead Uber's new research group. Her research has focused on making the technology that undergirds self-driving cars more affordable and efficient. By: Staff Torstar News Service Published on Uber is launching a research group devoted to driverless car technology in Toronto, creating a third hub — its first outside the U.S. — for the company’s ambitions in a frenzied field that Uber and its competitors believe will upend transportation, generating billions of dollars in the process. The Advanced Technologies Group will be led by Raquel Urtasun, a University of Toronto computer science professor who holds a Canada Research Chair in machine learning and computer vision. Urtasun uses artificial intelligence, particularly deep learning, to make vehicles and other machines perceive the world around them more accurately and efficiently. The group will hire “dozens” of researchers and engineers in the next few years, the company says. Uber will also make a multimillion-dollar, multi-year commitment to the Vector Institute, the artificial intelligence institute that launched in Toronto in March with investment form both government and private sources, including technology companies as Google, Nvidia and Shopify. Urtasun, who will remain a professor at U of T, is one of the Vector Institute’s founding members. “Toronto has emerged as an important hub of artificial intelligence research, which is critical to the future of transportation,” Uber CEO Travis Kalanick wrote in a blog post welcoming Urtasun and announcing the group, praising the Ontario and federal governments for their investments in the field. Uber has already put semi-autonomous cars on the roads in Pittsburgh and San Francisco, the homes of the other two Advanced Technologies Groups, and more recently in Arizona, but the company has not said when Torontonians might be able to hail a self-driving car. Last year, Ontario became the first province to launch a pilot program that permits on-road testing of automated vehicles (AVs). Carmakers and technology companies that want to participate must apply to the Ministry of Transportation, and if approved must have a human in the driver’s seat of the AV at all times. Monday’s announcement comes at a critical time for Uber’s self-driving car program. Waymo, Google’s self-driving car unit, launched a lawsuit against Uber in February, accusing the company of using stolen trade secrets to develop sensors for its autonomous vehicles. Waymo alleges that a former manager, Anthony Levandowski, illegally downloaded 14,000 documents, including detailed circuit board designs for a laser-based sensor known as LIDAR, before leaving the company and founding Otto, a startup that was acquired by Uber approximately six months later for $680 million (U.S.). More from Metro News: A robot is coming for your job as the age of automation dawns Driverless cars could make GTA congestion worse in the short term, report says Self-driving cars will collect data — and Canada's privacy commissioner is concerned Uber has denied the accusations, saying that the LIDAR it developed in-house is significantly different from Waymo’s, that after diligent searching there is no evidence of any stolen Google documents on Uber’s servers, and suggesting that the Waymo lawsuit is an attempt to stifle the progress of a major rival. Waymo has asked a federal court in San Francisco to halt Uber’s self-driving car research until the case can be resolved. The judge is expected to rule on the preliminary injunction within days. Lawsuits of this kind are common with rapidly evolving technologies for which even a nanometer-thin competitive edge can offer a critical advantage, legal experts say. “You have people racing to get there with limited (numbers) of people who are well-versed in the field,” said James Pooley, senior counsel at Orrick and a Silicon Valley-based specialist in trade secrets and technology. “People moving from one place to another in a highly charged, highly competitive environment, produces — frequently — cases like this.” Pooley and others say it would be highly unusual for the judge to order Uber to cease all work on self-driving cars. But even a lesser order could be an impediment. “They certainly have put an enormous amount of effort into defending themselves. They see this as something that’s quite critical.” Kalanick has emphasized that self-driving cars are at the core of his vision for Uber and for the future of transportation. “This is not a side project. This is existential for us,” he told the New York Times in an interview after the company acquired Otto. Urtasun’s lab has focused on making the technology that undergirds self-driving cars more affordable and efficient. She has developed systems that use cameras to reconstruct and understand a vehicle’s surroundings, a much cheaper alternative to LIDAR. She has also worked to find low-cost alternatives to the highly detailed, labour-intensive maps that AVs currently rely on. Urtasun, who this year was awarded one of Canada’s most prestigious scientific awards — the E.W.R. Steacie Memorial Fellowship from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada — works on the algorithms that knit all of a vehicle’s sensors together rather than on the hardware itself. “Toronto and Canada for the past two decades has been at the forefront of AI, and that’s the expertise we’re bringing to Uber,” she said. A number of self-driving car crashes and mishaps have dominated media attention in recent months. In May 2016, the driver of a Tesla operating in “autopilot” mode died after his car struck a truck turning across his lane. An Uber car in self-driving mode was involved in an accident in Tempe, Arizona, in March. Police in Arizona cited the other driver in the Uber incident, and a U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration investigation into the Tesla crash blamed human error, noting that Tesla’s crash rate dropped 40 per cent after the installation of autonomous technology. Improved safety is one of the primary reasons that researchers and regulators are interested in developing self-driving vehicles: algorithms are not prone to the same distractions and mistakes as human drivers, and Ontario’s Ministry of Transportation specifically cites “minimized driver error” as a potential benefit of the technology. The province also cites reduced traffic congestion and greenhouse gas emission as a result of more efficient vehicles.

BlackBerry KEYone review: A tale of a decent phone full of annoyances Jordan Palmer Follow View All Posts 2017/05/04 6:00am PDTMay 4, 2017 9 Plus 1 on G+ 20 Share on Facebook 48 Share on Twitter Total Shares77 Blackberry KEYone News Phone Reviews Reviews Article Contents 1 Specs 2 The Good 3 The Not So Good 4 Design & build quality 5 Display 6 Battery life 7 Audio 8 Call quality & connectivity 9 Camera 10 Software 10.1 BlackBerry apps 10.2 Settings & general UI 10.3 Performance 11 Value 12 Conclusion The KEYone, the latest in the BlackBerry Ltd/TCL collaboration, is a phone that returns to the Canadian brand's iconic roots, for better or for worse. With Nougat and a strong focus on security, the KEYone is aimed at enterprise users and long-time fanatics. Overall, the spec sheet for this phone is nothing chart-topping. The SoC is over a year old at this point and the screen has been downgraded from the year-and-a-half-old Priv's, but using the KEYone was mostly a pleasant experience until after about a week with it. That was when I started experiencing rather noticeable slowdown and other problems. So what does a proverbial return to form for BlackBerry mean in the ever massive Android space? Well, there's not really a simple answer. But let's get going — we've got a lot to cover. You don't want to be here all day, do you? The unit that I've been using for the last week and some change is pre-production. There have been a few hiccups with the software along the way, which I'll note in the appropriate section below. Most of these problems will hopefully be fixed before the KEYone is available for sale. Specs Display 4.5" IPS LCD 1620 x 1080; 434 ppi CPU Snapdragon 625 GPU Adreno 506 Software Android 7.1.1 Nougat; BlackBerry Security RAM 3GB Storage 32GB, expandable via microSD Cameras 12MP IMX378 (1.55μm) rear, 8MP front Battery 3,505mAh; Quick Charge 3.0 Misc USB Type-C 3.1, fingerprint sensor, 3.5mm jack, physical keyboard, NFC Connectivity 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac, dual-band; Bluetooth 4.2; LTE bands 1/2/3/4/5/7/12/13/20/25/26/28/29/30 Measurements 149.3 x 72.5 x 9.4 mm; 180 g Buy BlackBerry The Good Software The "stock" take on Android with BlackBerry's apps is great. It feels like what Motorola does: functionality added on top of Google's vision. It has the latest security patch and Android 7.1.1. Battery life My time with phones from the likes of Huawei and Xiaomi has somewhat desensitized me to stellar battery life, but the KEYone is definitely above average. Screen The color accuracy, brightness, and viewing angles are spectacular. The screen crisp and more than adequate, despite its odd size and aspect ratio. Fingerprint sensor I am not sure from where the fingerprint sensor was sourced, but it's almost on Huawei's level for speed and accuracy. Seriously, my success rate has been almost perfect. Build quality The KEYone is one hell of a solid device. The aluminium frame combined with the soft-touch back make the phone feel extremely durable. The Not So Good Ergonomics/weight The KEYone is chunky and is a bit difficult to hold. Typing with one hand on the physical keyboard is also a pain. And even though it's only 180 grams, the KEYone feels very dense and heavy. Using it single-handed is not a pleasant experience for long periods. Speaker I know this should go without saying, but the speaker quality on this phone is pretty terrible. Performance Major lag, homescreen redraws, and RAM management issues led to a phone that, after about a week of use, became almost unusable. Design & build quality To give you some perspective on the KEYone and its design, the marketing materials say that the phone is "Distinctly different. Distinctly BlackBerry." That last part, and to an extent the first, is quite true. BlackBerry (well, it's really TCL, but you know what I mean) has opted for what you might call the quintessential look that defined the heyday of Research In Motion. And while that seems like a negative at first glance, the KEYone's design exhibits some modernization in its overall execution. This phone garnered more looks, comments, and questions in my time with it than any other I've used — I'd say that it comes close to the amount of attention I received when smartwatches were still young. The physical keyboard is what drew people's eyes. The whole front face would throw anyone for a loop, especially when we're starting to see such high screen-to-body ratios these days. Not a single person that I've come across thinks that this is a pretty device... and I agree with them. The KEYone is not beautiful, elegant, slim, or anything else like that; it is aimed at a niche that, in theory, cares little for those things in a pocket computer. From the back, the phone looks fairly unassuming and normal. The soft-touch finish feels like it was ripped off of the good ol' OG Nexus 7. My fingertips glide across the band-aid texture, but when push comes to shove, my hand grips it solidly. Coupled with an aluminium frame, the KEYone feels sturdy, durable... and like a brick. To put this kindly, it is one hell of a chunky phone — I actually had 2010-2011 phone era flashbacks when I removed it from the box. At 180 grams (6.35 ounces for you Imperial folks), the KEYone gets quite heavy in the hand after prolonged usage. See, I have this odd tendency to support phones with my little finger while I'm using them; BlackBerry has made me decide to try to break that habit. I know that I mentioned it briefly, but let's talk seriously about the KEYone's keyboard. When smartphones were starting to trend toward on-screen keyboards, I was not happy. I liked the tactile response of my Droid and Droid 2, and haptic feedback was just not as satisfying. I had also not learned to type without looking on my G1 or HTC Hero, a problem I did not have with any of my Droids or BlackBerries. I eventually got over myself and became a solid fan of SwiftKey and the navbar that Google brought to Android with Ice Cream Sandwich. Now that I'm all done reminiscing, let's get back to the topic at hand. The KEYone's backlit keyboard is really good, if not a little weird after spending the last several years with a software variant. If I were a keyboard nerd like Ryan, I'd describe the travel distance, tactile feel, and the like — I just like my gaming mice and PC hardware. While the keys are much too small for my taste, I found that I actually had very few errors in general usage. Each one is easily pressed and responds with a solid click. The layout is obviously QWERTY (duh), so it's pretty easy to get to the point where you're typing fairly quickly. So far, the only things that have taken me some time to adjust to are the symbol layout and the placement of the left shift key versus ALT. Most of my errors have been activating the alternative mode instead of capitalizing the next letter. If you're into it, there are 52 programmable keyboard shortcuts that can open apps or contacts. For instance, you could assign a long press of 'c' to open Chrome, 'f' to start up Facebook, and so on. There's one catch, though: it's limited to the BlackBerry Launcher. In any other, long-pressing a letter will bring up a phone search for shortcuts and apps that are associated with that key. One of the other interesting features is the flick gesture, which inserts the first SwiftKey-like prediction when you, well, flick your thumb up the board. My biggest gripe about the keyboard is the fact that I have to see it every time that I am using the phone. Whereas the Priv has the sliding mechanism to mask its keyboard when you aren't using it, the KEYone's stares you in the face. This reduces the screen size to 4.5" and a 3:2 aspect ratio. I understand that this design choice was made in the spirit of the BlackBerries of old, but I can't say that I am a fan. And if you don't like the physical keyboard or just don't want to use it all of the time, you can use the software version. However, unlike the Priv, this is not the best option. A full-screen keyboard on this smaller display is not the most pleasant of experiences. The fingerprint sensor is fantastic. Embedded in the space bar, it's lightning quick and very accurate. Only Huawei's sensors have proven so reliable for me, which should tell you something. The front of the phone has the screen, the capacitive navigation buttons, the keyboard, and the front camera (and earpiece/sensors) along the upper aluminium bezel. The back has the rather large camera module (there's still a hump, by the way, despite this thing being a brick) and BlackBerry logo. On the top of the frame, you will find the 3.5mm headphone jack. The left side only has the power button, while the bottom houses the speaker grilles and the USB Type-C 3.1 port. Finally, the right side is home to the SIM tray, volume rocker (which feels cheap and hollow) and what BlackBerry calls the "Convenience Key." Both it and the power button feel only slightly more solid than the volume rocker and I'd honestly rather see one of them be textured or differentiated in some way from the other. Just because they're on opposite sides of the phone does not mean I didn't mix them up from time to time. The Convenience Key is a tertiary button that is customizable and can be mapped to almost any action you want. It can open a certain app, activate one of many shortcuts, or perform a few system functions like power off. At this moment, I have it mapped to Google Now since Assistant is tied to a long press of the home button. Let's just say that I've opened Now a lot more than I usually do. It's cool to see BlackBerry trying to cater in some form to power users by adding in this key. At least this isn't chained to a useless virtual assistant. Overall, the KEYone is well-built, but it is a polarizing device in its design and construction. Some people will love it, while I think that most won't. It doesn't have the sneaky, incognito aspect that the Priv did, which is not necessarily a bad thing. Whether you like the look of the phone or not is entirely up to you — I'm just not the biggest fan of it. Display When discussing the KEYone's display, most will inevitably focus on the aspect ratio, i.e. its general shape. BlackBerry went with something decidedly more square than what most of us are used to. Despite this, the 1620x1080 IPS panel is crisp, clear, and quite bright. I am rather fond of the color reproduction, and I found this to be one of the more accurate panels that I've used. There's even an sRGB mode. The viewing angles are superb and the screen is just a joy to look at. It also gets very bright for outdoor use. The display is not the KEYone's strongest aspect, but nor is it the weakest. The resolution is more than adequate especially given the total screen size. There really isn't that much more to say on the matter: great screen, awesome colors, but it won't blow you away. Battery life With a 3,505mAh battery, you'd expect the KEYone to last a long time. I mean, that's one of the features that BlackBerry is hoping encourages people to buy this phone. The good news is that it is certainly above average. After using Huawei and Xiaomi devices for the last few months, I have gotten used to a phone that can easily get me through a day, so I am glad that this one continues the trend. During my testing, I had the screen at 100% brightness with plenty of texting, emailing, messaging, and several attempts to watch YouTube videos and play games. Not only did I get over five hours of screen-on-time, but the idle drain on the battery was practically negligible. The largest battery to ever come in a BlackBerry phone and the screen resolution help to contribute to the claim that you can get 26 hours of "mixed use," but if you run low, Qualcomm's Quick Charge 3.0 is supported. When you plug the phone in, you are presented with two options: Charge Only and Boost Mode. The latter is touted as "giving you the most efficient charge possible, even if you only have a few minutes." Good on BlackBerry for making another phone with good battery life. It's pretty damn stellar. Audio When I think of a BlackBerry, I don't always picture a phone with the best sound quality and output. Sure, it might get the job done, but you know what I mean. In all fairness, the KEYone is not meant to be your media player — rather, it's not supposed to be the one on your desk that pleases your ears the most. It gets the job done, that's about all I can say. The sound that pushes out of the headphone jack is tolerable and works just fine for the gym or other activities where you won't be lugging around high fidelity cans. The external speaker is subpar, even considering that this is a smartphone. For music or notifications, there is plenty of distortion and crackling at 80%+ volume. The cacophony at that level is awful, so I've left the KEYone in vibrate-only most of the time. At least the phone has a good vibration motor. Call quality & connectivity When I first received the KEYone and inserted my SIM card, I was sorely unimpressed. Mobile data would not work due to a problem with the APN settings and the phone presented me with an annoying notification telling me that there was a problem. After some digging and chatting with "people in the know," I found out that this was a known issue with this pre-production build of the software and it was being addressed in preparation for the final release. After manually setting up the APN for my MVNO carrier, my wireless connectivity has been passable. Call quality reached my expectations — Bluetooth and WiFi have also been reliable. I have had my LG Watch Urbane (Android Wear 2.0), Moto 360, and Samsung Gear S3 connected to it during my entire usage. None have had any issues staying connected, nor did I have trouble with any of the Bluetooth headsets I tried. Reception, however, was another matter entirely. The phone constantly dropped calls or failed to make them at all. I also frequently lost data connection or experienced slower speeds than what I am used to on my carrier. The KEYone also experienced cell signal holes that have never been there — I went through a hole near my house every day, but all of my other devices were just fine in the same area (same SIM, etc). It was extremely frustrating. Camera I'll admit: I went into all of this not expecting much from the camera. Come on, it's a BlackBerry. But seriously, the KEYone's is legitimately good. It performs well in low-light environments with post-processing that is kind to photos. I'm certainly glad to see BlackBerry carry on where the Priv's camera left off. With all of that being said, it cannot quite hold its own next to the Pixel, GS8/GS7, or even the P10. The KEYone can put out good-quality pictures that are crisp in detail, but with some aggressive smoothing in post-processing. Those of you who pay attention will notice that the KEYone packs the same sensor as the Pixel, the IMX378. While that certainly can lend itself to good photos, it's not the be-all, end-all. My opinion is that this is one of those phones where it's more difficult to take a bad picture. This camera is like a jack-of-all-trades — you'll get great outdoor, indoor, and nighttime photos. Will they have that so-called "Wow!" factor? Well, that depends on you. Moving around to the front, BlackBerry opted for an 8MP fixed focus, 84° wide angle shooter. LCD flash is also included. Supposedly, this is best suited for those video conferences where you're not in a position to get somewhere with better lighting. This is the official blurb on the matter: "For times when you have to take a video conference on the go, the device includes an 8MP front camera with fixed focus, LCD flash, and 84-degree wide angle lens." Just own up to the fact that you put in an LCD flash for selfies; there's nothing wrong with that. Wrapping all of this up, let's go over the camera UI. It's basic, but in a good way. In Auto, you are presented with the upper bar that has the settings for flash, timer, aspect ratio, and HDR, as well as the general options. Along the bottom is the gallery preview, front/rear camera switcher, shutter button, mode selection, and visual effects. In the options, you have the control mode, where you choose between auto and manual. Then there's the JPEG fine or standard compression choices, face detection, and video resolution stuff. The KEYone can go all the way up to 4K30fps, but you lose "enhanced video stabilization" above 1080p30, which is kind of a bummer. Contrast this camera app UI with something from Huawei and you'll see why I am a huge fan. There aren't as many options, but what's there is useful and mostly necessary. Good job, BlackBerry. Previous Next Software When the Priv launched a year and a half ago, the general consensus seemed to be that the software was good. Much like Motorola and OnePlus, BlackBerry has gone with a "stock+" take on Android, i.e. where Google's vision is kept intact, but useful features are added on top to better the user experience. The KEYone follows the same logic, though with Nougat 7.1.1 running underneath this time around. The BlackBerry brand is built on security, reliability, and stability. When the company shifted over to Android from the corpse that was BB OS, it brought with it some of the hallmarks upon which it had built its reputation. There was a commitment to updating to the latest monthly security patches, the DTEK security suite, and even some hardware modifications that all helped to ensure users had the safest and most secure take on Android. Now we're here with the KEYone and that focus is still on-point. On the surface, the software looks like stock Android, but there's a bunch running under the hood, from the apps to the settings and options. I'll go through both of those elements in their own sub-sections to follow. I think you'll be as surprised as I was in regard to the level of depth and detail with each addition made. Not all of it is useful, in my opinion, but it's there. BlackBerry apps This is one of the pillars for BlackBerry's plan to draw potential customers. My time with BlackBerry's phones was so long ago that I hardly remember what BB OS was like (and I never even used v10). Even if I did, I can tell you right now that I was not a hardcore user, so the KEYone gave me my first experience with a lot of the apps that BlackBerry loyalists swear by. The Hub app is where it's at, at least in terms of sheer power user capability. This functions as a place where you can see all of your messages, emails, texts, and other related notifications. It pulls from Gmail, your default SMS app, IM services, and various social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, and LinkedIn. Due to the volume of incoming emails and the email-fu that I am forced to do each day, I ignore Gmail in Hub. It was just too difficult since it still doesn't support the tabbed inbox or filters/labels as well as I'd like. You can also set up custom views for Hub, where you select what accounts will show up — this is how I was able to successfully "ignore" Gmail. For enterprise users, this could be the way you separate your work and personal data. While this is all great, I frankly got bored when trying to make Hub work to my advantage. It can take a lot of work, time, and effort to get it the way you want it. I have no doubt that some people will do this, because there is much power to be had in the app, but it is not for everyone.   Nipping at the heels of Hub in terms of marketing importance, we have DTEK. Though it's still being hyped just like it was when the Priv launched, it remains a mostly useless, feel-good example of the placebo effect. You're presented with red Xs, yellow exclamation points, and green check-marks that denote your level of security in various areas. It's a centralized location to show the average user the basics of Android security, which isn't a bad thing. I suppose I am shrugging it off because I know what I'm doing when it comes to this stuff and my perfectionist/completionist nature hates not seeing green check marks. Since I am not going to change my usage habits, then I might as well not look at annoying yellow exclamation points. For those of you who are wondering what my DTEK status is, I am sitting firmly at "Fair." As annoying as that is, at least I am using a BlackBerry device (because that's one of the security checks). I can sleep a bit better tonight knowing that. If you hit green on all criteria, then your needle will be in the "Excellent" range on the gauge. Good for you.   DTEK is actually worth a damn when it comes to showing what apps are accessing certain permissions and notifying you when they do. Or you can have it inform you when a specific application is requesting certain permissions. For example, I can tell DTEK to let me know when something accesses my calendar or to notify me when Action Launcher alone tries to read it. There are certain people who will love this — I am not one of them. BBM is here, for some reason. It's still the same old app and I really don't feel like going over it. Basically, if you use BBM then you know what it is. If you don't, you're not missing much. There's still no SMS functionality; Android Messages is your default out of the box. The Calendar app is cool, I guess. It still has the "Meeting Mode," which automatically silences your phone when you're in a meeting according to your calendar. There are also options for creating events in different time zones from the system one and whether or not the app informs you if events conflict. It's a neat take, but I wouldn't call it special. Finally, there are various note-taking, task, password management, and photo markup apps. None are particularly worth paying attention to and I am sure there are better offerings from either Google or other third-party developers. I don't want to waste too much time with them. Settings & general UI Apps are great and all, but what about overall user interface? Like I said, the software is "stock+" Android. It looks, feels, and functions much like Nougat would on a Nexus or Pixel, but there are additional options to play with. Most of them lie in the display settings menu, so I'll address some of them. There's the color balance slider (for cool or warm, or somewhere in between) How you want the Recents menu to look — you have the choice of Rolodex, which is the normal way, Tiles, and Masonry A green bar along the edge of the screen that shows the battery level remaining while charging (it's neat and I've seen it before in custom ROMs) An option to double tap to wake/sleep the phone. There's one final piece that I want to address in more detail. It's called the Productivity Tab and it exists as a small white bar on the far right edge of the screen (its position and thickness can be adjusted). If you've used Action Launcher and the Quickpage feature, then that's basically how this works. If you have no idea what I'm talking about, the Productivity Tab pulls out from the side of the screen and has five sections. The first is a calendar widget showing you what you have going on that day or the next. After that is a Hub shortcut to show you any unread messages. Sections 3 and 4 are a todo and contacts list, respectively. Finally, there's a settings sub-menu for the Tab, where you adjust position, transparency, height, thickness, etc. I like the Productivity Tab for little more than the calendar widget, which is exactly what I use the Quickpage for in my default Action Launcher setup.    The other addition you'll see in the system settings is for the Convenience Key, which I mentioned all the way back up closer to the top of this review. It's the thing under the volume rocker that looks/feels exactly like the power button. Oh, yeah, you can map it to open whatever app or shortcut you want. I find it mostly useless. but some may find it to their liking. The sub-menu itself is pretty straightforward: it shows you what the key does, what action is currently assigned to it, the option to clear said action, and a short list of what you can map to it. Here's what's available to choose: "Open app" will bring up a list of everything you have installed "Speed dial" allows you to set a contact to the key (don't do this) "Send message" allows you to open either an email or a text to send to a specific contact "All shortcuts" brings up a long list of all the shortcuts that BlackBerry thinks you could ever use/need. Once you make your choice, that's what the Convenience Key will do until you select something else. It only works when the screen is on and unlocked, so keep that in mind. There's a gestures section, but it only has the toggle for the double-tap power button for camera shortcut. Not sure why this is off on its own, but whatever. The sound settings still has the "Notify during calls" and "Flip to mute" options — I disabled the former because who needs that. The security area is actually almost stock, except for the picture password. By the way, skip that, too. Developer options has the sRGB mode toggle I mentioned earlier (which always turns itself off when I back out of the menu), but it's missing the OEM unlock entry. Because this is BlackBerry, so no unlocking or rooting for you. Everything else is all the same as a Nexus or Pixel. BlackBerry Launcher, the default out of the box, is pretty basic. You have the option for those keyboard shortcuts and little else of note. After I toyed around with it for a bit, I moved on to Action Launcher. The notification shade and Quick Settings are also just like stock with the same animations and everything.   If you're super paranoid about people peering over your shoulder to look at the stuff on your screen, BlackBerry provides you with the Privacy Shade (via the Play Store). This prevents others from physically seeing private and sensitive content by blocking out everything except for a tiny viewing area. How big this little window is depends on what size you want, but even with Privacy Shade active, you can still interact with your screen. It's neat, I suppose. You can adjust the shape and background transparency via the little menu that appears when the Shade is active. Performance The Snapdragon 625 powering all of this is not too bad of a chip. Though decidedly midrange and a year old at this point, it carried the KEYone along better than I would have thought initially. However, after about a week, the lags, stutters, and hiccups started to settle in, with the most noticeable being exiting the camera app, constant homescreen redraws, and apps not remaining in memory very well. The camera thing was especially bad when I used the power button shortcut to launch the camera from a locked state; exiting after this caused the phone to hang for almost thirty seconds. Following that, there'd be another forty-five seconds of unresponsiveness, even from the fingerprint sensor or power button. Suffice to say, it was quite annoying and dismaying. I am not sure whether this is a bug in the pre-production software or not; regardless, it was irritating and made using that shortcut more than useless. As time went on, the sheer sluggishness of the phone became quite apparent. Animations would lag, the whole OS would hang when launching apps at random intervals, and my homescreen redrew every time I went back home (I used BlackBerry, Action, and Nova Launcher — all with the same result). I also experienced some seriously aggressive RAM management/problems. As an example, I opened a new app for the first time and needed to sign in. I knew my password, but needed my 2FA code. Switching over to Authy, I grabbed the code and double-tapped the recents button to switch back to the original app... only to find that it needed to reload, requiring my credentials again. After all of that, the 2FA code had expired. Rinse and repeat; I just used Authy on my PC to get signed in after a near instance of rage quitting. That's just a singular example, but things like that happened often. Geekbench 4 was having troubles The Adreno 506 GPU is pretty capable, though. The only problem is that there is no reason to game on this phone — not only is the screen quite small for such an activity, but the keyboard and overall design of the phone's face make gaming uncomfortable. The GPU is just wasted potential, I'd say. These issues could be related to this pre-production hardware and software, but there was a point at which the KEYone became unusable. These problems persisted through reboots. Performance for the first several days was quite good, but it deteriorated very rapidly. Surprisingly so, actually, which made the disappointment I felt seem worse. I should note that I will be retesting everything with a production model when the phone is released to see if these issues persist. Value As we near the end of this journey review, I'm left with a few questions. The one I will ask and hopefully answer in this penultimate section is this: Is the KEYone worth it? Besides the horribly stylized name and physical keyboard, what is the value proposition of this phone? It will retail for $549 USD, which puts it at the high end of the midrange spectrum. That's still a hefty sum for a year-old SoC and some very fast performance degradation, even though both of those come with a decent screen, good camera, and awesome overall software experience. Even with all of the security stuff and the keyboard, I am not entirely convinced that $549 is a good price. $349 is probably the most that I would pay for this phone, especially when you consider that a Pixel is $100 more than the asking price ($650) or that a OnePlus 3T starts at $440. Both phones come with better internals, a similar overall UI/UX, and better cameras. What makes the MSRP even more painful is the subpar performance (note: again, this could be related to the pre-production hardware/software), something that I cannot in good conscience ignore or fail to mention in this regard. You will be much happier with what OnePlus, Google, and even Samsung have to offer you. BlackBerry is likely going to aim this at the enterprise, which may not care about the price tag as much as us normal consumers. Those users, however, do want a phone that's going to work well no matter what they're doing. The long and short of it is that if you're considering this phone as one of your options, then I'd say go with the OnePlus 3T as the best value for your money; if your budget is a little more flexible, then go with a Pixel or Galaxy S8. If you're really interested in one of these, just wait until they go on sale. Conclusion So who is the KEYone for, exactly? According to BlackBerry, it's meant for: "people who use their phones more for communication rather than media consumption, people who are tired of having the same one as everyone else, people who are professionals and rely on their phone to get things done, and people who are looking for something durable that will last through a busy day." If you want my opinion (and you did just read this whole thing, so why wouldn't you), I would say that the KEYone is for the BlackBerry power user of yore. I never was one, but I do know a few who still talk about their old phones. This phone is for them. Minus the DTEK50 and DTEK60, the KEYone is BlackBerry's (and TCL's) latest real attempt at the Android side of things since the Priv. From my time with it, the KEYone failed at providing a good user experience, even though it is a little eccentric and anachronistic in a cute way. BlackBerry returned to its roots with this phone, its aim fixed squarely on the fans of old. Personally, I happen to prefer the glass slabs that we have nowadays and I think that the KEYone is a relic of a long bygone age. I eventually adjusted to the form factor and physical keyboard, but even after reaching that point, I still did not enjoy typing (versus my current neutral feeling on the matter with the software versions). Simply put, I do not like the KEYone. I do, however, appreciate a solid, well-built device even if it is a brick. But good construction is only a single criterion when evaluating a device for recommendation and I don't think that the average consumer or even an Android nerd would enjoy using this phone. It's kind of ugly, bulky, dense, and one of the main draws, the keyboard, is a novelty at best. This is definitely a niche product and I usually frown on that because it's so limiting — honestly, that's probably just the business student in me talking. BlackBerry/TCL clearly have a target market for the KEYone that they believe is slavering for it (I am certainly not in it). That being said, narrowing down to a specific demographic does not excuse a poor user experience. I've said it plenty of times in this review, but I'll say it again: I know that the model I have is pre-production hardware and software. Bugs, janks, and other oddities are to be expected. There was supposed to be an update for the review units, but I have not received it as of this writing. I like what the KEYone is trying to be and do. It's a quirky little thing that was actually fun to use sometimes just because it's so different. The "stock+" Android is also quite refreshing and helped to subdue some of my frustrations early on. But being unique with great software cannot carry a phone through the trials that this phone presented. And no, the irony of this is not lost on me — I usually get the phones with outstanding hardware and bogus software. The Snapdragon 625 is a decent chip in its own right; on paper, I should have never had the problems I did. Odds are, either you have already decided that you want one of these or your company's IT department will purchase them in bulk. In both of those cases, I wish you the best and hope that you have the best experience that this phone has to offer. Perhaps the issues I've had will be fixed with production hardware or a few software updates down the line, or maybe it's all been down to bad luck in the silicon lottery (#jordansluck). But I just have a feeling that the KEYone will go down as one of those Android phones that has a cult following, but is ultimately worth more in a few years as an antique than as a daily driver today.

It probably has its niche, but I agree that the era of the keyboard phone has passed, and for good reason. I'll take my big screen and easy one-handed typing, and honestly, I sincerely doubt I would ever be faster on a hardware keyboard. We're all so used to software boards and such autocomplete wizards that I bet 90% of people out there would never get close to matching their speed with a touchscreen on one of these chiclet boards. I also don't really think the camera seems like anything all that special, at least based on the samples here. Nick Becker Honestly, the physical keyboard was the only reason I was considering getting one of these. What I really want, though, is a new version of the HTC G2/Desire Z. YaKillaCJ I still have 1 in a drawer somewhere. That device was awesome and innovative. Hmm, maybe if HTC should look into the keyboard. Nick Becker I still have mine, too. It's just too old now for modern apps. Good_Ole_Pinocchio Phone with a 625... If you're not getting the Z Play, you're doing it wrong.... And well I completely agree with you on hardware keyboards being ridiculous in 2017 robogo Lenovo P2. Same specs, 5100 mAh battery. steadymobb Will the p2 ever get 7.0 though? Prob not... Sohit Especially considering the LG G6 is on sale for $500 Francois Nguyen I actually HATE most touchscreen keyboards, even if if's for typing small messages. I even hated landscape mechanical keyboards because I always break the sliding mechanism over time -_-. Being used to portrait mechanical keyboards (and old PC keyboards from the 90s) for so long, the only cellphones that lasted for me were a BB Q10 for 2 years (and a Palm Treo 680 for 5 years before that). I abused the heck out of Android Runtime for gathering my most needed apps. I tried iOS for 1 year and never got used to the keyboard. I tried several Android phones that didn't last 3 months for me. I'm glad now that the KEYone will show up in June 2017, even if it's WAY too late for me and I'm ironically not interested in buying it lol. Jack ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ mostly nostalgia. Honestly I will buy it if the price drops to $400 level YaKillaCJ My bet is the lags are due to stock 7.1.1. The 625 is very capable of everyday task proven by other OEMs. Something Xiaomi's Miui has a huge advantage over nearly everyone, optimization while including plethora of features. Proven by the Redmi Note 3 Pro (SD650) and Redmi Note 4x (SD625). Plus this price is just too much and I said it when it was announced. Yet so many nay sayers were upset at my comment siting its niche product. While a Niche allows it to be sold for more than Xiaomi and Huawei offerings, it doesn't justify pricing past Flagship specs. This cost more than OnePlus 3/T, ZTE Axon 7 & Xiaomi Mi5 that offer Flagship specs/hardware, thriving OEMs and update history. Not to mention Miui and OxygenOS. Blackberry should drop the price and use Android 7.0 instead until Google themselves stabilize Android 7.1.x. Miku is Best Vocaloid I don't think it's an issue with the Android version. My Moto Z Play has been running LineageOS ever since it became official and I haven't encountered any lag issues, even after a few weeks. If an unofficial version of 7.1 can run perfectly on the 625, there's no reason OEM 7.1 can't run properly on it. YaKillaCJ My key words were stock. As in they never optimized the Android software. Great examples is how Miui and OxygenOS takes whatever version and clearly tweak and optimize it. So I'm not surprised LOS runs great, it includes a modified/optimized kernel, drivers, blobs, default apps, etc tailored for your device. Throwing straight up stock versions of Android that basically just runs without optimization nor bug fixes is something TCL is known for. Look at Blu for example. HabsSuck what a hate on commentary, come to expect it from some HumbleButBlunt Although I agree with your comment I find it hilarious coming from someone who's screen name is "HabsSuck". DEVVVV Too bad BlackBerry continues to do what got them in trouble in the first place. this is due to total lack of innovation. Blackberry was a one hit wonder and if they don't get someone in there that possesses innovation they are done. HumbleButBlunt They are already done making devices... Nate650 Total lack of innovation!? This phone showcases innovation in many ways, such as the capacitive keyboard which they have a patent on. The same can't be said about the popular iPhone. All Apple has basically done in the last five generations is change the screen size. Michael Tran Does it have always listening "ok google" That would be a dealbreaker for me if it doesn't have it. Pat Richardson Your reasoning about the keyboard does not work for me. "Easy one hand typing" isn't even a thing anymore now that phones are 5.5" to 6" and touch/swype (word prediction selected "tofu") is a pain because of poor predictions. Since there is only one small flag ship phone (Sony xperis compact) one hand typing shouldn't even be an argument against a physical keyboard, which is more accurate, quick, and does not require looking at the keys. Every other word on swipe I swear I have to rewrite because of horrible predictions. And touch doing is no better since you cannot feel the keys I agree with everything else toy said about the phone though. Marcelove Start using Swiftkey and stop complaining...😉 Pat Richardson That's funny because that's what I'm using ToniCipriani ✓pǝᴉɟᴉɹǝʌ I used it. It's sh1t. As with every other bajillion VKB out there. I don't need keyboards that try to learn and output what it thinks I'm typing. I need a keyboard to output what I type, nothing more. Capacitive screens are inherently inaccurate. Imparus The size isn't really an argument when it comes to keyboard, pretty much every keyboard support "one hand" mode, where you can make it smaller, so even if it is big you can still reach all the letters with one hand. Pat Richardson While I can concede to this, phones are no longer small enough for one-hand general use. Trying to tap that top right button with your left hand puts you at risk of dropping your phone, so you mostly operate your phone with two hands anyway. To make a keyboard smaller for one hand typing is counter-intuitive for a screen size that's more operable with two hands. Maybe during situational uses the one handed mode is fine. Anyway, despite this argument the physical keyboard I find is much more accurate and comfortable than touch typing. Winston They know there's a very dedicated niche dedicated to this class of smartphone, and seeing how they're the only player in a field with very dedicated fans, I don't blame them for charging the significant margin. Chris Oh "LCD" flash??? David Ruddock The screen flashes white. DEVVVV the screen flashes white?? So that must mean only for selfies. what if I am doing a recording? and want to see how it is recording in real time?? ecnjnr Tbmobn fby Uo B Mayoo Did it hurt when you fell on your keyboard? Kieron Quinn Maybe they just put their KEYone in their pocket ecnjnr 6P ;) ecnjnr My virtual keyboard posted this from my pocket, lol. Can't wait for a physical keyboard phone. Mayoo http://whatyearisit.info/img/what_year_is_it.jpg ecnjnr 2017 :) Miku is Best Vocaloid There's something called "locking" you may have heard of it :^) Cinj Still don't understand why BB dumped their own OS in favor of Android, especially since BB10 was capable of running Android apps. That's like buying a Mac just to format the drive and put Windows on it, what's the point? I bought my mom a Blackberry Classic and it's a great little phone especially for more tech challenged people who don't need or want all the bells and whistles that come with the two major players. If BB is going to shift to just making mediocre Android phones, they may as well close up shop already. Francois Nguyen Some reasons I guess (based on my own experience with BBOS 10): - Software AND hardware issues on double-tapping on the hardware keyboard - lack of apps - lack of support from major players (facebook, BB itself) Cinj My response to each point: - No opinion since I haven't encountered this - 99% of apps are garbage so no big deal - You can't as easily help clog the internet with pics of the unimpressive food you just ate, unfunny memes, and "like, share, and type amen or you're going to hell" spam? How will humanity survive??? - Quite the opposite. BB is way less obtuse in it's interface than the constantly changing Android one. Android and it's apps are like a hieroglyphic tile puzzle that keeps getting shuffled with every update. Try teaching a tech illiterate parent how to operate Android, I dare you. - Neither of those really have a distinct advantage over the other. But it's nice to have options all the same. - See previous opinion on apps Not trying to slam you or anything, just giving my take. I think we need more options in the marketplace, not less. That's really my main gripe. But I know that's a fantasy because people generally gravitate towards a duality, so for now we're stuck with iOS and Android until some paradigm shift occurs. Francois Nguyen My responses to your responses lol: - it's not a widespread issue; it's not surprising a lot of people didn't know about it - that 1 % of good and varied apps is what everyone I know (tech illiterate or not) makes the switch to iOS or Android so I wouldn't ignore that - I agree with you on your statement. Most consumers disagree on this, though... My friends ABSOLUTELY need to tell the world what they eat for supper and what they read when they're in the bathroom, for example. - Most people that tried my BB Q10 or any Z10 in kiosk ABSOLUTELY disagree with your statement. They're all biased towards iOS or Android, I know (me too, BTW). But that's how sad the situation is when BB got too late to the consumer market. There's no incentive to switch OS. About teaching Android to a tech illiterate, I always did that to several 65+ years people in my neighborhood who never touched a PC in their daily life because it's too complicated for them. In short, BB OS = complicated, Android = easy, iOS = too easy. YMMV. - That's not a big issue now for developers. It's gonna be an issue when most apps (garbage or not) require Kitkat or later. Lack of incentive for devs = lack of enthusiasm for the platform. Winston Compatibility =/= native support. android apps run TERRIBLY on BB10 Cinj To be fair, most Android apps run terribly on Android too. And you're really not missing anything if you're unable to run most of the schlock that infests the play store anyway. Metallinatus Android apps have Google Play Services on Android, which is essential for a hell load of apps to work.... DEVVVV Chen ruined BlackBerry HumbleButBlunt Looks like the stock market disagrees with you. Nate650 The answer is simple: it didn't sell well and the lack of an ecosystem. Being able to run Android apps is not the same as having access to Google Play. ecnjnr I hope Blackberry resolves the performance issues by launch, or I'm reconsidering my purchase. Thanks for the review Jordan Palmer You and me both. ToniCipriani ✓pǝᴉɟᴉɹǝʌ I'm just curious if you guys ever got updates. Some other reviewers stated they got at least 3 updates after receiving the review unit. Jordan Palmer I received a single update after this review went live. So far, it has only fixed some of my cell connectivity issues. Nothing else. Suicide_Note Even if they do that, it's still a mediocre phone. ecnjnr I'm a fan of physical keyboards. This phone is a Moto Z Play with a slightly bigger battery, a newer version of Android, a better camera and a physical keyboard. That's worth $100 to me, but maybe not for you. freshprince_87 Moto Z Play has a bigger battery Nate650 Bigger by a whopping 5 mAh. freshprince_87 Yep. Makes all the difference Miku is Best Vocaloid You can wait for the Moto Mod that will have a physical keyboard. ToniCipriani ✓pǝᴉɟᴉɹǝʌ If they do a portrait version that is. Martin Rios Dude it depends on the market... Yeah say that "virtual keyboards are better than physical keyboards, swipe, etc.) but there are some folks that are waiting for the rise (or maybe it's the hype) for these kind of devices. Also another point is this sentence >>> "people who use their phones more for communication rather than media consumption, people who are tired of having the same one as everyone else, people who are professionals and rely on their phone to get things done, and people who are looking for something durable that will last through a busy day" >>> I'M ONE OF THEM. I can give less than a f*ck about aesthetics, ceramic look and all that crap, what I want is to be able to comfortably reply my company emails, open docs, scan paperwork, take crisp photos on the field and not sweating the cold if the phone ever slips from my hand (which I doubt). Sure phone must pass through IT Dept to block lost of sh!t like social media but I have my personal phone for that. I'm hoping a OEM in the near future release a phone with nowadays hardware and inspired by a Nokia E7-00, by the way that's my company device (I rejected a trashy Samsung Grand Prime the company tried to make me use, instead I went to Ebay and got a cheap yet efficient Nokia with a horizontal keyboard, Symbian, a decent camera and EAS capabilities). Nate650 Yea, it's a big issue. I still experience performance issues on my Priv. The Priv would be such an amazing device if they address those issues, but it's already been over a year old and they haven't. Do employees even use their own phones? They have to know about these issues by now. Kawshik Ahmed Does the stock 'Blackberry Launcher' supports Android 7.1's 'Launcher Shortcuts' or you have to use a 3rd party launcher ?? Muzaffar I don't understand that BB named it KEYone instead of Mercury. Venice also looks promising at first but becomes flop latter. Nate650 The name is the least of their problems. The performance issues and price are more important. Muzaffar That's why it becomes a flop. paul4tA I skimmed most of the review and went straight to the performance, because if they haven't fixed that from the PRIV, nothing else matters. I love my physical keyboard and have actually come to appreciate some of the other features over time, but I don't think I can take another year of the terrible performance, waiting sometimes minutes for the software to catch up with me. Nate650 It's interesting that not all the reviews mentioned poor performance. That leads me to believe there is a particular culprit and that it's fixable. Jordan L 2 things: I need this on Verizon for one of my bosses, and where can I buy it? Jordan Palmer Updated the buy link. It's up in the specs. BB will be releasing a CDMA version sometime near the end of the month, I think. John Just hold off for 10 years or so until Blackberry's keyboard patents expire and we'll see it put to use by more competent manufacturers. HumbleButBlunt BB doesn't manufacture devices anymore. Cuvis They still hold the patents, and license them to TCL. HumbleButBlunt Yep, that is very true. Licensing out patents isn't manufacturing though and the initial comment was specific to manufacturers. Cuvis Not really. The poster was talking about Blackberry's keyboard patents expiring, and the comment about manufacturers could be talking about Blackberry's current licensees (ie TCL) rather than Blackberry itself. ToniCipriani ✓pǝᴉɟᴉɹǝʌ Probably earlier, when someone somewhere somehow leaks it China and other knockoff makers start building them. RickMLA Battery pull. Fixes everything. Francois Nguyen Battery is non-removable on the KEYone... ToniCipriani ✓pǝᴉɟᴉɹǝʌ Hold the power button for 32 seconds = Battery Pull Reset. JL It´s incredibly horrible! Dragos Lucian So Blackberry is starting to be like an ass itch, and I bet the majority doesn't like that feel. And while we're at it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rla7wt8wKGM djinn123 Just because you don't like PKB's it doesn't mean they aren't for someone else. I'm tired of hearing "who uses PKBs these days" or to that effect. If you can't understand why some people NEED it, then maybe you can just stfu? Stefan Seidel Is the keyboard touch sensitive like on the Priv? That's by far the most favourite feature on my Priv, and I'm sad everytime it doesn't work in an app. Also, as to add something useful to the physical versus virtual keyboard discussion: - multi-lingual virtual keyboards have only come up recently. I frequently write in different languages, and having to manually switch between them just doesn't work (especially when sometimes you insert a word from another language in the middle of a sentence) - I am a Sysadmin and every so often I do need to get in to some server from my phone. Doing that with a on-screen keyboard is nothing short of having a hot iron stamp on your forehead. Having the full screen AND quick and easy access to non-alphanumeric characters is such a huge plus that it would justify any price (if you need it for work/serious business). I agree that using Swype or Gboard with swiping is pretty darn good when it comes down to just blurting out some natural language. Anything beyond that is a pain. Hamilton Jimenez Vasquez I think physical keyboards are way better than touchscreen keyboards, but.... I wouldnt switch my large 5.7 and beautiful screen just to have a nicer keyboard, not in this world. Not sir. dabug91 So annoyed that this phone even exists. Blackberry needs to do the world a favor and permanently exit the smartphone business. They should have closed shop more than 6 years ago. Nate650 And how would that benefit you? Martins Nkem AndroidPolice and the rest needs to start pairing phones and reviewers better. What good does it do when the reviewer has already made up his mind about the device before trying it out.

These are external links and will open in a new window Close share panel Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The phishing email was sent to one million Gmail users last week A phishing email that targeted Gmail users is estimated to have cost the state of Minnesota $90,000 (£69,400). About 2,500 state employees received the email, according to the state chief information security officer. Around the world, people have reported getting multiple copies of the email, while others have received the message from trusted organisations. One million Gmail users, which Google says is "fewer than 0.1%", were affected. The cost to the Minnesota state government was mainly the result of employees dealing with the attack rather than carrying out their normal jobs, said state chief information security officer Christopher Buse. "I estimated three minutes of time per employee… it may be much more than that in many cases," he told ABC News. "It's important for people to understand not only that the attacks are happening but also to understand how costly they are." Mr Buse said that the cost could have been much higher but Minnesota state government agencies generally did not use Gmail or Google Docs. "Most of these scams are done using Office documents like Word and Excel spreadsheets", Ken Munro, of Pen Test Partners, told the BBC. "But a lot of big companies have moved away from traditional office software packages, and an increasing number are moving towards using Google." Other users affected Besides the Minnesota state government, a large number of other Gmail users were affected. Jacquelyn Piette, who is studying for an MBA at Boston College, tweeted that she had just received warning of the phishing scam when the message arrived in her inbox. Image copyright Twitter / Jac Piette Image copyright Emily Hughes / Twitter Image copyright Twitter / Evan Gartley Users who received the email were told a contact of theirs had shared a document with them on Google Docs. If they clicked on the "Open in Docs" button, they were taken to a genuine Google page that required them to log in with their account credentials. Once logged in, a service called "Google Apps" would ask them for permission to access their email account data. By agreeing to share their data, users were potentially giving the hackers access to their email account, contacts and online documents. The malware used this access to send copies of the phishing email to everyone in the recipient's contacts list. "As companies get better at security, scammers will start looking for connections between personal email accounts and professional accounts, which might sidestep some of the company's security," Mr Munro said. He said that introducing "layers of separation" - such as not checking personal email on the office computer - could help prevent such phishing campaigns spreading. "Companies could say they might not want you to check personal email on your work computer, but they don't mind you checking it on your mobile." Image copyright Twitter / Laura White Google said it had stopped the attack "within approximately one hour" and fewer than 0.1% of its users had been affected - about one million people. Those who did click on the link have been advised to log into their accounts and revoke access to Google Apps, then change their password.

Click the link and the scam used formal Google processes to acquire the user’s data, then cloned the email attack to everyone in the user’s contacts list. Google was able to put a stop to the attack within an hour of being notified, and reported that 0.1 percent of its 1 billion accounts were affected. That’s 1 million people successfully fooled. MORE: How to Protect Your Privacy Online The base level of advice in detecting phishing attempts is probably good advice universally around the internet: Don’t take what you see at face value. Email addresses and display names can be spoofed. Clickable links may install and run malware. The person we send private information to over an email may not have our best interests at heart. A healthy sense of skepticism goes a long way toward keeping yourself safe online. Phishing is just one tool a malicious hacker has at his or her disposal, but it’s an effective one. All the antivirus countermeasures in the world won’t save you from returning an email containing your bank account number — staying safe online requires an active mindset. It’s what Dan Guido, CEO of cybersecurity firm Trail of Bits, means when he says, "Security is not an app you can download. Keeping yourself safe on the internet means thinking about what you're keeping yourself safe from." Here are a few simple tips to keep in mind the next time you check or send email. MORE: Protect Your Privacy: Apps That Go the Extra Mile If an email looks strange but comes from a known person or email address, greet it with suspicion. Senders’ names and addresses can be spoofed to give the appearance of having been sent by anyone. And major brands care a lot about spelling and clear communication. You can probably easily understand your friends and family when you communicate with them online. If an unusual email would appear to have been written by someone else, avoid it. Think twice before sending any personal information via email. It may be completely called for to send a bank account number via email in order to initiate a bank transfer between accounts, but we should be aware that we’re distributing sensitive personal information as we do it. A healthy sense of alarm in communicating any meaningful personal information online — your address, social security number, passwords, and so on — will go a long way in keeping your information out of public light. Replying to an email with any such information should hardly be a reflex, but something we do after verifying that it's necessary.  Don’t click on the attachment. We repeat: Do not click on the attachment. This is especially true if it’s any kind of software, which may be equipped to compromise your device any variety of ways once it's successfully up and running. If you don’t know who the sender is or aren’t expecting something specifically, don’t run or install their attachments. Want More?

Ron Amadeo - May 8, 2017 3:20 pm UTC reader comments 150 Share this story The main section of Fuchsia shows a profile picture, and tapping on it will reveal some power controls. Above this section are recent apps, and below is a Google Now-style suggestion panel. There's a tablet mode, too. Tap on one of the cards for a full-screen app. You can long press on one of the apps to drag them on top of each other. This will start a split screen more. Here's dragging in tablet mode. Release and you'll get a split-screen interface. Split screen with three apps on a tablet. Four apps on a tablet. Here are three phone screens with a tab interface. The suggestions panel also can bring up Fuchsia's keyboard. Google, never one to compete in a market with a single product, is apparently hard at work on a third operating system after Android and Chrome OS. This one is an open source, real-time OS called "Fuchsia." The OS first popped up in August last year, but back then it was just a command line. Now the mysterious project has a crazy new UI we can look at, so let's dive in. Unlike Android and Chrome OS, Fuchsia is not based on Linux—it uses a new, Google-developed microkernel called "Magenta." With Fuchsia, Google would not only be dumping the Linux kernel, but also the GPL: the OS is licensed under a mix of BSD 3 clause, MIT, and Apache 2.0. Dumping Linux might come as a bit of a shock, but the Android ecosystem seems to have no desire to keep up with upstream Linux releases. Even the Google Pixel is still stuck on Linux Kernel 3.18, which was first released at the end of 2014. Google's documentation describes Magenta as targeting "modern phones and modern personal computers with fast processors, non-trivial amounts of RAM with arbitrary peripherals doing open-ended computation." Google hasn't made any public, official comments on why Fuchsia exists or what it is for, leaving us only to speculate. The "modern phone" shout out certainly sounds like something that could eventually compete with Android, but for now the OS is so early, it's hard to tell. Fuchsia is impossible to talk about without mentioning a hundred other related projects that also have code names. The interface and apps are written using Google's Flutter SDK, a project that actually produces cross-platform code that runs on Android and iOS. Flutter apps are written in Dart, Google's reboot of JavaScript which, on mobile, has a focus on high-performance, 120fps apps. It also has a Vulkan-based graphics renderer called "Escher" that lists "Volumetric soft shadows" as one of its features, which seems custom-built to run Google's shadow-heavy "Material Design" interface guidelines. Armadillo, the Fuchsia System UI This all leads us to an interesting point right now: the Fuchsia interface is written with the Flutter SDK, which is cross-platform. This means that, right now, you can grab chunks of Fuchsia and run it on an Android device. Fuchsia first went public in August 2016, and but back then compiling it would get you nothing more than a command line. Thanks to Hotfixit.net for pointing out that the Fuchsia System UI, called "Armadillo" is actually pretty interesting now. It's possible to download the source and compile Fuchsia's System UI into an Android APK and install it on an Android device. It consists of a wild reimagining of a home screen along with a keyboard, a home button, and (kind of) a window manager. Nothing really "works"—it's all a bunch of placeholder interfaces that don't do anything. There's also a great readme in the Fuchsia source that describes what the heck is going on. Enlarge / The official Armadillo logo, clearly done by one of Google's top artists. GoogleThe home screen is a giant vertically scrolling list. In the center you'll see a (placeholder) profile picture, the date, a city name, and a battery icon. Above the are "Story" cards—basically Recent Apps—and below it is a scrolling list of suggestions, sort of like a Google Now placeholder. Leave the main screen and you'll see a Fuchsia "home" button pop up on the bottom of the screen, which is just a single white circle. The center profile picture can be tapped on, and here you'll bring up a menu that's a bit like Android's Quick Settings. The top row of icons shows the battery and connectivity. Below that you'll get sliders for volume and brightness, and icons for airplane mode, do not disturb, and auto rotate. You can interact with the buttons and sliders, but they won't actually do anything on Android. Below that are buttons labeled "log out" and "more," which don't work at all. Above the profile section are a bunch of cards labeled "Story [something]." The readme describes stories as "a set of apps and/or modules that work together for the user to achieve a goal." That seems pretty close to a recent apps list, maybe (eventually) with some kind of grouping feature. Tapping on any card will load it as a full-screen interface, and since one is labeled "email," it's pretty obvious that these are apps. The list is sorted by "last opened" so the most recently-used cards will sit at the bottom of the list. This list also has some window-management features. You can long press on a card and drag it around, and if you drop it on top of another app, it will trigger a split screen mode. The split screen system seems really capable, and probably needs to be reigned in a bit.  You can do a 50/50 split vertically or horizontally. You can drag in a third app and 33/33/33 split horizontally or vertically, or a 50/50 split next to a full-height app, or a have a tab bar appear for the three full screen interfaces. You can drag in four apps and do a 75/25 split on one side of the screen and 25/75 on the other, and then you can keep dragging in apps until the whole thing crashes. Go back the story list and you'll see your split screen layout is reflected in the card, too, which is nice. The bottom "Google Now" panel starts with a search bar mockup. Tapping on it will bring up a keyboard, but this is not the Android system keyboard, and it is instead a custom Fuchsia interface. It has a new, dark theme, and things like long-pressing for symbols or settings do not work. Below that appears to be Google Now, which has several "suggestion" cards. They seem to be a little different than Google Now's news, weather, and calendar suggestions though, with the docs saying "Conceptually a suggestion is a representation of an action the user can take to augment an existing story or to start a new one." That almost makes it seem like an app launcher. A long road ahead With any new project at Google, it's hard to know what the scale of the project will be. Is this a "20 percent" project that will be forgotten about in a year or something more important? Luckily, we have a direct statement from a Fuchsia developer on the matter. In the public Fuchsia IRC channel, Fuchsia developer Travis Geiselbrecht told the chat room the OS "isn't a toy thing, it's not a 20% project, it's not a dumping ground of a dead thing that we don't care about anymore." The Fuchsia logo.Android was conceived in the days before the iPhone. It started as an OS for cameras, and then became a BlackBerry clone, before being quickly retooled after the iPhone unveiling. With Android, Google is still chained to decisions it made years ago, before it knew anything about managing a mobile OS that ships on billions of smartphones. I'd say the two biggest problems with Android right now are Getting OS updates rolled out across the third-party hardware ecosystem A lack of focus on smooth UI performance. While there hasn't been anything said about an update plan, the OS's reliance on the Dart programming language means it has a focus on high-performance. Fuchsia really seems like a project that asks "how would we design Android today, if we could start over?" It's a brand-new, Google-developed kernel running a brand-new, Google-developed SDK that uses a brand-new, Google-developed programming language and it's all geared to run Google's Material Design interface as quickly as possible. Google gets to dump Linux and the GPL, it can dump Java and the problems it caused with Oracle, and Google can basically insulate itself from all of Android's upstream projects and bring all the development in-house. Doing such a thing on the scale of Android today would be a massive project. The hardest part might not even be developing the OS, but coming up with some kind of transition plan from Android, which has grown to be the world's most popular operating system. The "cross platform" feature of the Flutter SDK sounds important for a transition plan. If Google could get developers to start writing apps in Flutter, it would be creating an app ecosystem that ran on iOS, Android, and, eventually, Fuchsia. Google has also shown that it is able and willing the make the Android Runtime work on non-Android platforms with Chrome OS, so if Google does choose to go through with a transition plan, perhaps it could port and entire Android stack over to Fuchsia as a stop-gap app solution. Back in August when Fuchsia went public, Geiselbrecht told the Fuchsia IRC channel "The Magenta project [started] about 6 months ago now" which would be somewhere around February 2016. Android hung around inside Google for about five years before it launched on a real product. If Fuchsia follows a similar path, and everything goes well, maybe we can expect a consumer product sometime around 2020. Then again this is Google, so it could all be cancelled before it ever sees the light of day. Fuchsia has a long road ahead of it.

According to online reports - in particular, a detailed user thread on Reddit - clicking on an emailed share link, purportedly from a known source, was taking users to a site that asked permission for a fake app calling itself "Google Docs" to access their accounts. If they agreed, the app would then send additional copies of the original email to the users' contacts. Earlier reports suggested the attack was a phishing scam potentially aimed at harvesting personal information and maybe even Google login credentials. However, in a statement, Google said that while the campaign accessed and used contact information, no other data was apparently exposed. READ MORE: Don't get caught out by the Primark voucher scam which is promising customers £100 Google said it was able to stop the campaign in about an hour. It has disabled the offending accounts, removed fake pages and updated its Safe Browsing feature, which issues warnings when users visit dangerous sites. Users do not have to take additional action, although Google encouraged those who want to be extra safe to run its security check feature. The scam seems to have surfaced sometime Wednesday afternoon and appeared to first target journalists - many reports from BuzzFeed, Hearst, New York Magazine and Gizmodo who reported receiving the infected email. Victims have noted that the email sender may be someone they know or who is one of their contacts. One telltale sign for identifying the spam email is that it appears to be directed to the address hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh@mailinator.com and is only blind copied to the recipient. Looking for a job?

Google reported first-quarter sales of $24.75 billion versus a $24.22 billion estimate on April 27. “We consider [Google] shares an attractive value considering its premium position in the media landscape, impressive growth and valuation of media incumbents,” MKM Partners Managing Director Rob Sanderson said in a note. MKM raised its price target on Google from $1,000 to $1,170. Google’s website growth and core margin expansion were positive, Sanderson said, adding that the only missing piece of the company’s results was a “more aggressive” buyback. Running Revenue Circles Around Facebook The $70 billion web advertising business is “still growing by 21 percent,” Sanderson said. Google added more than $15 billion in revenue on a trailing 12-month basis, a number equivalent to more than half of Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB)’s business as a whole, the analyst said. Investor sentiment “has softened somewhat” after an advertising boycott fueled by objectionable content paired with YouTube ads, Sanderson said, but added that the company’s strong financial results and management’s comment on the boycott should put shareholders at ease.

At least eight civilians were killed on both sides in fighting that began when a Pakistani census team accompanied by soldiers visited disputed villages along the southern border on Friday. Pakistan inherited its 2,400-kilometre (1,500-mile) border with its western neighbour when it gained independence from Britain in 1947, but Afghanistan has never formally recognised it. And while official Afghan maps reflect the so-called "Durand Line", many nationalists believe the true border of their country ends at the River Indus that runs though Pakistan and gave India its name. "Officials from the geological survey departments of the two countries will conduct a survey, and they will also make use of Google Maps," said a senior Pakistani security source in Islamabad who requested anonymity. Abdul Razeq, the police chief of Afghanistan's Kandahar province, added: "After negotiations, both sides have agreed that a geological survey should be conducted. "Technical teams of both countries will use GPS and Google Maps as well as other means to get the answer." Internet firm Google complies with local laws in certain countries that compel it to show borders in line with national demands. For instance, its Indian site shows the entirety of disputed Kashmir as controlled by India. In Pakistan, however, the site shows the internationally recognised de facto border, the Line of Control, marked with a dotted line to denote it is disputed. In 2010 Google was embroiled in a Central American border dispute that saw two neighbouring countries dispatch troops and heavily armed police to their joint border. The incident happened after a Nicaraguan commander cited Google's version of the border map in an interview with Costa Rican newspaper La Nacion to justify a raid on a disputed area of Costa Rica. Google later said it had made a mistake and corrected its map to reflect one sanctioned by the US State Department. Pakistan last year began trying to harden the traditionally soft border with Afghanistan through trenching and fencing, but its efforts were met with hostility from Kabul. Ethnic Pashtuns living in the region have traditionally paid it little heed. Villages straddling the frontier have mosques and houses with one door in Pakistan and another in Afghanistan. Pakistani forces yesterday elevated their rhetoric when they said they had also killed "more than 50 soldiers" in last week's border clashes - a claim quickly rejected by Kabul, which said it lost two soldiers.

May 8, 2017 • 7:47 am | (0) by Barry Schwartz | Filed Under Google Search Engine Optimization Prev Story Next story Tweet Pin It   Prev Story Next Story The other week, we spotted Google showing a job portal search results set in their web results. It was an experiment that Google would not confirm outside of saying they are always testing things. Aaron Bradly, the schema king, reminded me on Twitter that a month or so ago he spotted Google showing Jobs related schema options in the Partner-only Features section of the schema page. The jobs option included jobs, pending properties and job search content policy. Aaron also pointed out that some of the sites he was looking around at did have schema markup for job results. Here are screen shots he shared: So if you have a job site, might be worth adding job related schema. Forum discussion at Twitter.

Home > Google News > Google SEO > Google: Agreeing With Us Doesn't Equal Good SEO; We're Often Wrong Google: Agreeing With Us Doesn't Equal Good SEO; We're Often Wrong May 8, 2017 • 8:11 am | (33) by Barry Schwartz | Filed Under Google Search Engine Optimization Prev Story Next story Tweet Pin It   Prev Story Next Story A couple weeks ago, Gary Illyes from Google posted on Twitter saying "I'm often wrong." I let that one slide and decided not to cover it with a title saying "Google says they are often wrong," or something like that. Well, the other day, Gary posted again on Twitter saying the same thing with more context. Here is the tweet: @MyNameIsTylor @aleyda @randfish @dr_pete @Suzzicks @stonetemple @wonderwall7 Agree with Google =! Good SEO I'm wrong many times, questioning what I say for example is actually good. It makes me rethink what I said— Gary Illyes ᕕ( ᐛ )ᕗ (@methode) May 5, 2017 So he said just because an SEO agrees with Google, it doesn't mean that SEO is doing good SEO work. He said "Google =! Good SEO." He added, "I'm wrong many times, questioning what I say for example is actually good. It makes me rethink what I said." Testing what Google says, even when it comes to how Google handles 302 redirects maybe, is a good thing. So do your own tests, make your own conclusions but try to do it all within the guidelines so nothing comes back to bite you later on. Forum discussion at Twitter.

Hongkiat.com Main Menu Design / Dev Technology Inspiration Social Commerce All Deals Search Hongkiat for: Reveal Search Form Reveal Off-canvas Navigation 28 Tips for Digital Decluttering and Organization Published by Hongkiat Lim, in Culture Most of us spend a lot of time in digital spaces inside our computers and mobiles, and just like our real space, digital space requires tidying up, organization, and even some kind of renewal from time to time to keep it function at its full potential. Five Analog To-Do List Systems for Better Productivity Five Analog To-Do List Systems for Better Productivity We previously discussed the allure of productivity tools: do they actually work when it comes to increasing your…Read more So, in this article, I share a bunch of tips about how you can efficiently declutter and manage your digital space. 1. Don’t cram the work into a single day Don’t take your digital spacelightly, it can be as messed up as a basement storage. So, before trotting into the business of tidying up, take a bird’s-eye view of whatever it is that you want to declutter or organize. Whether it’s an email inbox or the Downloads folder, avoid underestimating the amount of work to be done and the time you will need. If you have enough free time to wrap up all the work in a day – that’s great, otherwise, take it slow instead of jam-packing everything into a single session as that will do more harm than good. 2. Label or file emails using filters For every email that’s from someone you often receive emails from, such as colleagues or utility companies, create an appropriate filter to label, or file it automatically, for instance into “Work” or “Bills”. This keeps your emails organized and when you have to view a set of related emails, say you want to see all the bills you have received in a month, you can simply search for the appropriate label. All email services and apps come with filter settings (Gmail, Yahoo, iCloud, Microsoft Outlook). 3. Let the browser ask where to save downloads In your browser, enable the option that allows you to choose where to save a downloaded file (Chrome, Firefox, Opera, IE) if it isn’t already enabled. Any time you’re downloading a file, instead of letting it go directly to the Downloads folder, create a relevant subfolder and save it there. If you’re downloading files related to a project, add the name of the project to the new folder. This way, whenever you need a file (or a group of related files) and you don’t remember its name, at least you know where it can be found. Deleting files from the Downloads folder is also easier this way. When you’re done with a project or if you just don’t need a certain set of related files anymore, you can just delete its folder. 4. Don’t delete files, archive them In the name of decluttering, you don’t have to delete every file that isn’t needed at the moment. If they’re partially downloaded or temporary files or such, delete them. If they can be used later, organize them accordingly. With many options such as cloud storage, external hard disk, etc., you can save files without worrying about running out of memory. 5. Sort by date while organizing Sort all your files by date first, before going through the bunch. Chances are you will find the files created or downloaded on the same day belong to a same project/category, which makes organizing them easier. 6. Employ quick search for mobile apps If you have too many apps on your phone (and your phone is still handling it well) you might need a quick search feature to find and open apps (look for quick search apps in Google Play). When you have too many apps, no amount of organization is going to make looking for an app in the sea of apps easier than a quick search. Don’t bother creating folders if each folder will still hold a plethora of apps. If you have Siri or Ok Google enabled you can also use those to launch apps. 7. Organize apps by color In case you have a small number of apps on your phone, and by small, I mean a number of apps that can fill one or two home screens, and you want them to be a bit more organized to easier find them, sort them by color. If you don’t want to spend time sorting those colors precisely, just separate the icons according to warm and cool colors, and give each a home screen of its own. 8. Make use of symbols and emojis Long redundant words for folder names or labels can also add visual clutter sometimes. Use emojis and symbols where applicable to shrink the names. 9. Disconnect unnecessary services In all the email and social accounts you hold, look for any setting that will list all services or apps connected to that account. If you find a service or app that you no longer use disconnect it from your account. This can reduce unwanted emails, notifications, and ads and protect your account details from third-party apps you no longer need. Have a look at the following links to look for connected app settings in Google, Yahoo, Facebook, and Twitter. 10. Don’t use calendars for to-dos and notes Using calendars to stay organized is great and almost all calendars have the options add events, to-do items, and notes to a day. If anything needs to be done on a certain day it’s an event and should be marked so in the calendar. To-do items, however, vary each day and should be reviewed on a daily basis. Separating calendars from to-do items and notes gives a less overwhelming and crowded overview of your time. 11. Don’t download files to archive Instead of downloading files to your computer for the purpose of archiving, open your cloud storage and save it there. If your cloud storage application comes with an option to save files directly via URLs use that, or try browser extensions or third-party services that will let you do the same. 12. Rent or stream instead of buying or downloading Don’t download movies, songs, e-books and such if you are not sure they are the classics that you will be returning to very often. This saves space and keeps your library more manageable. 13. Don’t subscribe, get feeds Don’t subscribe to emails from websites, instead, choose to get feeds. There are plenty of RSS reader services, such as Feedly, that will keep you up-to-date with the content of websites you want to get informed about regularly. 14. Store in-process files, not exports If you have planned to archive (store) a file and that file has an in-process file, for example, a Word file of a PDF exported from it, or a Photoshop file of a PNG image exported from it, save the in-process file and not the final product (unless you will be needing those exports quite often). This ensures that every time you need the final version, you get the most up-to-date export out of your in-process files, all while saving some space on your hard drive. 15. Assign a procrastination window Let’s be honest, no amount of sermon can stop some from checking Facebook and Twitter while working. If you’re going be procrastinating on social media open those accounts in a separate browser window and keep your “working” window free from distractions, making it easier for your eyes to lock down on a tab when you need it. Bonus: you have to close just one window and it closes all your social media pages. 16. Plan your backups and storage It’s a good thing to have an off-device storage, but just at how many places? With a multitude of cloud and external storages available, it’s easy to get disorganized that way, too: some files in Dropbox, some in Google Drive, some in Amazon, some on pen drives… you get the gist. So, plan your off-device storage in advance. It’s good to separate work and personal files. For work, you may want to choose a storage method that is primarily used in your workplace. Choose a storage system that is versatile, which makes sharing or transferring files to other systems easy. At times, physical storage is mandatory, for instance a boot CD. In these cases do some real-world organization. 17. Save passwords before using There are many password management apps available online, or if you’re old-school get a notebook to jot down all the passwords. Hence, managing passwords won’t be an issue if every time you sign up for a new account you remember to note down the password and account information into your master password vault. If you’re forgetful about this try to develop the habit of saving your password first in your vault and then create the account. In this way, you will have all your accounts’ info and passwords organized in your vault without fail. But, if for some reason you can’t access your password vault and you can’t postpone the account creation until you do, set a reminder to add the password and the account information to the vault. 18. Check if mobile sites are equally good as apps These days, a lot of websites are highly optimized for mobile users, so much so, that some of them are just as good as their mobile app counterpart. So, if you find a service that is easy to use and fast enough in the mobile browser just as much as its mobile app equivalent remove the app from your phone and start using the site. 19. Separate email IDs If you have a website or if you are part of a corporation, chances are you have a corresponding work email. But, if that’s not the case you should create one. A separate email for work and personal use is pretty neat. It helps manage your emails better; less spam will interfere with your work emails because you will give away your personal email for subscriptions and such. If you are a social media enthusiast an email ID just for your social accounts is not a bad idea either. 20. Use more gadgets, get more space If offline storage of songs, videos, e-books and photos in your phone is important and you are often running out of memory, why not try using separate gadgets for separate reasons? This tip is probably not suitable for those who don’t like to carry extra baggage around. However, if it’s not this might be the best solution for you: a music player, an e-reader, a camera, a mini video player, or a hybrid of some of these. You can also store your files in external hard drives that work with your mobile phone (via ports, adapters, or WiFi), and store and use files from there. 21. No files on desktop screen I understand that desktop space is there for quick access of files you’re working on, and I also really have nothing against a desktop screen covered with files and apps, for as long it works for you. But, if the desktop screen is one of your problematical digital spaces, then my advice would be to not save anything on the desktop. Same as for mobile apps, don’t bother creating subfolders or arranging icons by some system. There’s a huge visible difference when you see files on a desktop screen and inside a folder. On the desktop, it’s too visual and distracting, while in a folder, it’s less visual, more text based, and hence a bit easier to process. 22. Try creating a new social media account I would recommend the usual drill of unfollowing accounts you no longer want to see updates from and reconfiguring your notification, privacy and ad settings in social media accounts to tame them, but for some, this is easier said than done. If your social media is overwhelmingly hard to deal with you can start anew; it’s a practical solution. You can either create a new account, befriend your friends/followers from old account little by little and then when you’re satisfied, delete your old account. Or, delete your account first, wait until it’s erased from the social media server and sign up with the same username. But whether it’s a new account or an old one, regular maintenance of feed is important. 23. Streamline your phone contacts Do not let the contact app of your phone be your contacts archive, too. Store contacts in your computer—go ahead and store as many as you want in there and keep them for as long as you want and add all the details that you can think of to them. But in your phone, keep only relevant, recent, and required contacts. This will automatically streamline the contacts appearing in your mobile apps and you won’t get unnecessary account recommendations. 24. Organize photos in chronological order I am not completely against on-device storage of photos. If you often browse through old photos or if you are that person who keeps photo-slideshow desktop wallpaper you should keep your photos on your device and purge files for space somewhere else. Although, irrespective of where you store your photos, there is only one right way to organize them, only one—chronological. Photos are associated with memories which in turn are associated with time, so make sure you create folders for all photos from individual events, then put all event folders into a folder named after a month or a year. The final (most upper level) folder should always be a year. 25. Think thrice before installing anything I know that if you have too many applications you can always “uninstall” them and I do recommend using an uninstaller app that cleans up all the leftover files from a software. But in most cases, files will be left behind after an uninstallation. It’s not much to worry about but over time (years, that is) they, too, can add up. If you are tech-savvy then snoop around for leftover files and clear them manually (which is better than what many apps can do IMO) but if you are uncomfortable with that then avoid unnecessary installations in the first place, especially on mobile phones. 26. Try built-in apps first Even though I said having a good uninstaller would be nice, in most cases, I would say first use applications that are already available in your operating system. Almost all OSs come with disk and memory clean-up utilities; use them to clear temporary files and cache. Also, all OSs, including mobile ones, have apps that list running services in your device, use them to stop unwanted background services and free up RAM. 27. Tone down on productivity apps Here’s my hundredth disclaimer; I do not claim that all the productivity apps out there are unnecessary, in fact, so many options in the market make it easier for us to find something that’s almost exclusively bespoke for us. But, if you are using too many productivity apps you are rather being productive in trying to be productive than actually being productive. One calendar and one to-do list will do. Don’t do both offline and online (unless off-line planning is therapeutic for you), use either one and stick to it religiously. 28. Get help If you read this far into this post you do have the patience to make a successful decluttering coup. Someone who is a bit messier with their offline space will most likely be the same in their digital space. And in reality, both organized and disorganized people are living happily today, so a digital organization rampage is not yet in every self-proclaimed disorganized person’s schedule. But, when a certain threshold of disorganization is crossed it can cause stress, and that disorganization will reflect in every aspect of your life, including digital. So, just as you would at times ask for someone’s help in real-space organization, do the digital decluttering with someone, too.

In fact, you might not think about smart home hacking at all. Why would someone want to get into your thermostat or your doorbell? But, smart home security is a big deal. And Burger King recently showed us why. What, Exactly, Did Burger King Do? Essentially, Burger King hijacked smart home devices in numerous people’s homes by broadcasting an audio signal through TVs. This kind of security breach is something homeowners interested in smart devices have been worried about for some time. The description sounds more nefarious than the event itself. In one of Burger King’s commercials, an actor says, “Ok Google, what is the Whopper Burger?” In homes currently equipped with a Google home system, this command triggered a number of devices to look up information on the Whopper. Is this a huge violation of privacy? Not really. Should it make you nervous about smart home security? Absolutely. Burger King — the last company you’d ever expect to intersect with the smart home industry — showed us that our smart home devices are more vulnerable than we think 5 Security Concerns to Consider When Creating Your Smart Home 5 Security Concerns to Consider When Creating Your Smart Home Many people attempt to connect as many aspects of their lives to the web as possible, but many people have expressed genuine concerns over how secure these automated living spaces actually are. Read More . It’s one thing to have a highly secure router protecting your devices. It’s another to have them taken over by a simple question asked in a commercial. Is This a Big Deal? This little prank seems harmless. And, for the most part, it is. Within three hours, Google put a stop to the prank by preventing Google Home from reacting to the sound clip from Burger King’s commercial. Wikipedia also had to put a quick stop to pranks by locking down specific editing privileges – the page listing the Whopper’s ingredients received additions ranging from ‘toenails’ to ‘rats’. But what if the next company to take over your smart home devices thinks it would be funny to tell Alexa to order their newest product? Or, what if a would-be thief figures out how to send an audio message through the speakers of your computer or phone? That would be significantly less harmless. Lesson Learned The take-away from this experience is that voice-activated smart home tech has some weaknesses that we haven’t totally thought through yet. We know how to protect our home Wi-Fi networks, and that goes a long way toward protecting our smart home gear. But there are other points of entry that we need to think about. Image Credit: Denys Prykhodov via Shutterstock You may want to give these weak links some thought before you fill your home with Alexa or HomeKit gear. Smart home tech has developed very quickly, and it’s really cool. But, it’s still in the early phases of adoption – and that means there are plenty of key security strategies we haven’t figured out yet. Of course, there’s always the potential for traditional hacking as well. Many smart home devices could do some serious damage if hacked. Imagine someone deactivating your window opening sensor, or turning off your fire alarm. Any kind of smart home security breach could place your family, belongings, and home at serious risk. How to Protect Your Smart Home We’ve established that smart home tech is vulnerable. So, what do we do about it? First, secure your home network. You should be doing this anyway, but it’s especially crucial when you have smart home gear set up. Change your router’s default password. Use a strong password for your Wi-Fi. Enable your firewall. We have tons of tips to quickly secure your network 7 Tips to Secure Your Wi-Fi Network in Minutes 7 Tips to Secure Your Wi-Fi Network in Minutes Is someone sniffing and eavesdropping on your Wi-Fi traffic, stealing your passwords and credit card numbers? Would you even know if somebody was? Probably not, so secure your wireless network with these 7 simple steps. Read More , and you should do them as soon as you can. Second, secure your phone. Because your phone controls so many smart home devices, it’s a potential access point to your home. This means that if your phone gets stolen or hacked, you could be in serious trouble.

Password managers can only be as secure as you want them to be, and if you're making any of these six basic mistakes, you're going to end up compromising your online security. Read More makes this extremely unlikely. Fourth, use a unified threat management (UTM) device. This can get expensive, but if you have a lot of smart home devices doing important things (such as locking your front door, or securing your windows), it’ll be worth it. These are physical appliances that pack a lot of anti-attacker tech (like this WatchGuard Firebox). They’re usually used by businesses and other organizations housing sensitive data, but it’s not a bad idea to invest in one for your home. Fifth, update everything. We say this about other kinds of devices all the time, and the wisdom holds true for smart home stuff, too. Firmware updates on your devices will make sure they’re better prepared to handle new threats as they arise. Finally, check Shodan. Once you’ve gotten everything set up, use Bullguard’s internet of Things scanner to see if your device is listed on Shodan, a search engine for publicly accessible IoT devices. If your devices are listed, check your preferences and go through the above list again.

Google is "currently exploring solutions" for connecting existing Google accounts to Family Link Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/06 7:09pm PDTMay 6, 2017 38 Plus 1 on G+ 79 Share on Facebook 77 Share on Twitter Total Shares194 Google News Back in March, Google launched 'Family Link,' a way for parents to create and manage Google accounts for their children (13 or younger). The feature ended up being very impressive, but had two huge limitations - it only worked on Android 7.0 or higher, and you couldn't use existing Google accounts for your kids. Thankfully, Google is working on a possible solution for the second problem. The company has updated a support page for Family Link with the below message: You can only use Family Link's parental supervision features with Google Accounts created using Family Link. We've heard from many people that they'd like to use an existing Google Account with Family Link, and we're currently exploring solutions. That's better than nothing, I suppose. I can understand why it might take more time to make that functionality work - in addition to the possible technical issues, Google has to follow all government guidelines related to online accounts for minors.

I'm glad Google is trying to help this out but what it's really doing is trying to help people out who didn't​ follow Google's guidelines in the first place. Corbin Davenport Yeah, that's a valid point. xeratun There are plenty of ages 13+ that are still minors. What if your kid is currently 15 and has used their account for years now but you want to bring them in? There's at least a 5 year phase in period based on that alone. But also, even if everyone follows the 13 rule, what if your kid makes it on their 13th birthday, but you just aren't aware of this yet then want to add it in. The option to roll that account into it is definitely handy. Cédric B It could also be an account 100% managed by the parent. For now my daughter uses my account when she plays, watches YouTube,... I think I should instead open another account for such purposes (and family link is not yet available in france). Even Google made a tv ad where a dad created an account for his newborn, then added in it emails,... that the daughter would get later. Jay In my case, I created the account for my kid just to reserve the name so that by the time he's old enough he doesn't have to have [email protected] I also use it to write to him so he's got emails from me throughout his whole life that he can go back and read one day. Finally, though the email address is his name, it's *my* account until I choose to hand it over, therefore it's not violating any guidelines or terms since I'm over 13 and the other info on the account is mine. Rather than add "his" Google Account to my family account, what I'm hoping Google will do is allow me to transfer "my" other, existing Google account to him now under the family account. You're using semantics to make it seem like he's using an account he shouldn't have against the rules, and that's not the case in my situation. SBBH I've done the exact same thing and also wish Google would make this work with existing emails. Violet There's also the fact that in order for an Android phone to work, you have to have a Google account. So, if your kids get phones before they're thirteen, there's going to be some fudging of birth years during setup. SBBH Yep, not sure why they've waited so long to address this when for years now every kid has had a phone and because of that an email address. I know there are administrator and guest accounts or something like that (can't remember the exact names) in Android but I've found it often doesn't work as advertised or the older phones simply don't support it. I think the government also needs to update the laws a bit when it comes to this. IMHO My1 iirc you dont need a google acc just so that the phone works, just to use Google stuff, like the playstore, yes people like to treat that as the same thing but it's slightly different. AQ Good, I made an account for my niece not long ago & would like her mom to have more parental type control over it when I un-block some google apps on her tablet/she gets a smartphone & ofc for the account to be more legit.

Ben_13 Same boat as me! I got my last name as a domain forever ago and set it up with google apps for domains. It has my account and sons and we've had it so long I don't want to find another email solution so that I can use a family plan...very unfortunate and annoying. James Carnley It's no longer for families. If you intend to keep your account for your family use instead of switching to a normal Google account then you will have to accept that new non-corporate/education features will not work for your account. Infamous_Elsa It still needs app restrictions and website blocking like iOS Tired_Guy I have maybe an unusual situation but likely not and I did bring it to Google's attention but... My son is 25 but IDD and is like a big 5 year old. He does not yet have a legal guardian, but seriously, he will forever be a minor. I set him up a gmail account for his tablet and because many social services ask for one and it's nice to let him have one of his "own". The mail comes to me anyway. He gets music off the family plan google play and Red and we can keep his music and video choices separate from ours. Having an account means we can set him up on a new device pretty quickly at least as his favorite stuff goes. But a lot of what FL offers is stuff I'd love to be able to do in one place rather than doing it all ad hoc. Trust me, if I die, his mom isn't going to deal with the hows and whys of managing his account, access, email, browsing etc. And yes, app restrictions would be such a bonus as the existing stuff out there really sucks and I'm constantly getting the kid off the password screes and back to his video because he his something he shouldn't have. But beyond COPA and age 13, tere are a ton of parents like me with adult children who are disabled who'd love to be able to allow their kids internet access while managing it for them.

Wang May 08, 2017 Playing catch-up. (Reuters/Paul Hackett) Share Written by Amy X. Wang May 08, 2017 Microsoft recently and dramatically unveiled what it says it is “the complete solution to education.” The company’s bundled launch last week included an education-specific version of the Windows 10 operating system, a handful of new programs and applications to be distributed to schools as teaching materials, and a “buttery”, classroom-friendly laptop. Clear was the message: Microsoft wants in on the exploding education technology market. Less clear is whether or not it has a good shot, given that there is already a much bigger player in the game. According to a report from US publication Education Week today, more than half of 1,000 teachers and administers in a kindergarten-to-high-school national survey said that if they had to incorporate more technology into students’ learning, they’d place their trust in one particular ed tech business above all others—Google. “Google has made huge amounts of headway in the school market and, at least for the time being, is winning the confidence of many educators,” Sean Cavanaugh, an author of the Education Week report, tells Quartz in an email, pointing to hardware like the company’s cheap, no-frills Chromebooks and software like G Suite for Education as products that have won schools over. Educators’ preference for Google is also reflected in sales numbers. In 2016, of the 12.6 million mobile devices shipped to US grade schools, 58% were Chromebooks. Microsoft, for its part, seems to know what it’s up against. The company’s new hardware begins at $189, making it a mean rival to Google’s $199 Chromebooks, and CEO Satya Nadella stressed the importance of affordability during last week’s press event. (Apple, which once targeted education via its eMac computer, now is more focused on offering small discounts to students on its $1,000 MacBooks.) With a new arsenal of simply-designed learning applications, such as a program that designs science experiments with everyday objects, Microsoft is now also going head to head with Google in the race for accessibility. “School officials overwhelmingly told us they want ed tech tools that are easy to use—things that make the jobs of teachers easier and simpler, not digital platforms that confuse them or pile on their workloads,” Cavanaugh says. The question now is whether educators have enough incentive to switch from something that already seems to be working for them. Microsoft’s chances—and those of any other companies trying to make a name in the digital learning space, for that matter—also rest on how much more room there is for the edtech market is to grow.

At least eight civilians were killed on both sides in fighting that began when a Pakistani census team accompanied by soldiers visited disputed villages along the southern border on Friday. Pakistan inherited its 2,400-kilometre border with its western neighbour when it gained independence from Britain in 1947, but Afghanistan has never formally recognised it. And while official Afghan maps reflect the so-called “Durand Line”, many nationalists believe the true border of their country ends at the River Indus that runs though Pakistan and gave India its name. “Officials from the geological survey departments of the two countries will conduct a survey, and they will also make use of Google Maps,” said a senior Pakistani security source in Islamabad who requested anonymity. Abdul Razeq, the police chief of Afghanistan’s Kandahar province, added: “After negotiations, both sides have agreed that a geological survey should be conducted. “Technical teams of both countries will use GPS and Google Maps as well as other means to get the answer.” Internet firm Google complies with local laws in certain countries that compel it to show borders in line with national demands. For instance, its Indian site shows the entirety of disputed Kashmir as controlled by India. In Pakistan, however, the site shows the internationally recognised de facto border, the Line of Control, marked with a dotted line to denote it is disputed. In 2010 Google was embroiled in a Central American border dispute that saw two neighbouring countries dispatch troops and heavily armed police to their joint border. The incident happened after a Nicaraguan commander cited Google’s version of the border map in an interview with Costa Rican newspaper La Nacion to justify a raid on a disputed area of Costa Rica. Google later said it had made a mistake and corrected its map to reflect one sanctioned by the US State Department. Pakistan last year began trying to harden the traditionally soft border with Afghanistan through trenching and fencing, but its efforts were met with hostility from Kabul. Ethnic Pashtuns living in the region have traditionally paid it little heed. Villages straddling the frontier have mosques and houses with one door in Pakistan and another in Afghanistan. Pakistani forces on Sunday elevated their rhetoric when they said they had also killed “more than 50 soldiers” in last week’s border clashes — a claim quickly rejected by Kabul, which said it lost two soldiers. — AFP                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Jakarta's Christian governor jailed for two years for blasphemy Two girls arrested for misusing boarding passes to meet K-pop star at Changi Airport Trump, Putin discuss first meeting, Syria during ‘very good call’ Singaporean man on the run in Brisbane for attempted murder Verdict expected in blasphemy case against Ahok today Trump, Putin discuss first meeting, Syria during ‘very good call’ Two girls arrested for misusing boarding passes to meet K-pop star at Changi Airport Two arrested for sending threatening letters, hell notes to PM Lee and other govt leaders Islamic State attacks base where US advisers stationed in Iraq Hamas eases stance on Israel with new policy document Most Watched Now Week NYT Video: How Danny DeVito eats an egg (and still says his lines) on Broadway Innovative globe chess board Reuters Video: After Macron win, Le Pen kickstarts rebrand Reuters Video: Cast and crew of ‘The Beguiled’ discuss the remake Tilda Swinton unveils strange ‘Okja’ promo clip Reuters Video: Thai man murders baby, commits suicide on Facebook Live Related Articles Head of IS in Afghanistan killed, confirms US and Afghan officials (VIDEO) This picture cost a US Army photographer her life Top US general says ‘not refuting’ reports Russia supplying Taliban Afghan defence minister, army chief of staff resign over deadly attack Furious Afghans call for resignations after Taliban base attack Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

Stay Connected With Hypebot.com « 5 Things Every Singer/Songwriter Is Doing Wrong | Main | How People Make Money On YouTube » Everything You Need To Know About The "Difficult" Warner Music Group, YouTube Deal Warner Music Group has become the first major label group to sign a new deal with YouTube.  And while WMG claims to have obtained better terms than previous Google contracts, its CEO also said the deal was made under "very difficult" conditions. ______________________________________ Here's all you need to know about the WMG YouTube deal: • Warner Music Group won some concessions including better ad monetization, according to several sources, along with better rates from YouTube Red, Google's paid music and video subscription service. The deal is also shorter than previous 3 year deals. (more) • In a leaked memo, WMG CEO Steve Cooper offered insights into this "difficult: negotiation: "We secured the best possible deals under very difficult circumstances. Our new deals are also shorter than usual, giving us more options in the future... Nevertheless, our fight to further improve compensation and control for our songwriters and artists continues to be hindered by the leverage that ‘safe harbor’ laws provide YouTube and other user-uploaded services. There’s no getting around the fact that, even if YouTube doesn’t have licenses, our music will still be available but not monetized at all. Under those circumstances, there can be no free-market ‘willing buyer, willing seller’ negotiation." (full text of the leaked WMG memo) • YouTube responded with a carefully worded non-answer that read, in part: "This new deal continues to capitalize on the growth in advertising revenue we've paid to the music industry - over a $1b paid out between November 2015 and December 2016 - and is an important step to enabling the international expansion of our subscription service, YouTube Red.” • Lyor Cohen, YouTube's Head Of Music, was less guarded in his reaction to WMG's complaints: "I was surprised, because it’s not been the context or the tenor of the negotiations... This deal is centered around their vision of helping us build a subscription business. And them encouraging us building the advertising business... I didn’t hear anything about safe harbor, or any of that stuff ... " Cohen said the deal was also about global growth: "The expansion around the world. We need the rights in order to continue expanding around the world." • Will UMG and Sony sign on soon? "I’m encouraged by all the conversations that we’ve had," said Cohen. "They recognize that YouTube has paid, in 12 months, over a billion dollars in advertising revenue alone. And they see subscription growing faster than any subscription category ever, alongside that. Remember there used to be an argument, a year ago, that our advertising funnel, was retarding the growth of subscription." (more on recode) • WMG reported a strong quarter on Monday morning, driven by streaming (including YouTube) revenue growth.

Suddenly, he hears a mysterious voice saying, “If you build it, they will come…”. Despite being taunted and teased, Ray decides to heed the voice’s advice and builds a baseball diamond on his land. For those of you who are Kevin Costner fans would know this iconic instruction is from the movie, Field of Dreams. Unfortunately, many of us are living in a field of dreams when it comes to SEO. Embracing a “Build it and they will come” mentality with online content, such as websites and blogs, will very likely rather lead to an SEO nightmare. The reality is that the momentum needs to be kept going once the website is live, and the hard work and dedication need to remain consistent long after the website is up and running. Covering all bases According to NetMarketShare, Google accounted for over 94% of all mobile/tablet search traffic globally in 2016, followed by Yahoo at 3% and Bing at 1%. Why then wouldn’t you want to make Google your proverbial friend? Statistics like these just highlight the value of a website and how it can enable your potential customers to learn more about your business, engage with your brand, and ultimately convert to a customer. Logically, this won’t be possible if no one can find your website to begin with. A whole new ball game If Ray (Kevin Costner) was living in today’s digital era, he would have probably started by ‘googling’ phrases like “building a baseball diamond” or “cheap construction supplies”. The first results – and therefore probably the most relevant results – that appeared on his search engine would be because of the amazing (and often misunderstood) thing, called SEO. There are many misconceptions regarding SEO. Many marketers think that SEO falls somewhere between title tags and meta descriptions, although it is much more than that. It is a system of strategies, techniques, and tactics that are working together to increase the visitors to your website by placing your website front and centre on the search engine results page (SERP). Search is playing in the major leagues The reason why SEO is so important to a business is that living in the era of instant information we’ve become so accustomed to having information at our fingertips, and the very tool that facilitates, this is search engines. No matter the question, we search. The amount of information that is available has changed the way we live. In his book, K. Hillis states the following: “The rise of Google as the dominant Internet search provider reflects a generationally-inflected notion that everything that matters is now on the Web, and should, in the moral sense of the verb, be accessible through search.” It’s this ‘if it isn’t on Google, it doesn’t exist’ mind-set that makes search and optimising your website so important for business, and not having an online presence when your customers are searching for products and services is no longer an option. Hitting a home-run with SEO There are three key areas that need to be looked at to truly get into the swing of SEO: Content, technical, and PR. Content: Get it right, right off the bat According to Andrey Lipattsev, who is a Search Quality Senior Strategist at Google, high-quality content and link building are the two most important signals used by Google to rank your website for search. (Source: Search Engine Watch, 2016). Hearing it from the horse’s mouth should definitely be a reason to take notice of why content is very important. It might be a cliché, but content remains king. The entire web is a content-based platform, so your customers are consumers of this content. The higher quality content you’re able to deliver, the better your website will perform in many different areas, including SEO. However, we need to move past things such as ‘keyword stuffing’ and writing for search engines only. At the end of the day, it is crucial to remember that people are our customers, not search engines. Technical: The heavy hitter Although search engines and the algorithms accompanying them are becoming more complicated, we need to remember that they rely heavily on software programs that help to decide whether your website will rank on the results page. This means that even though content is extremely important, any technical issues that could hinder your appearance on the search results need to be addressed immediately. Ensure that all technicalities are addressed and sorted out. PR: Fielding questions Online PR should be a team effort and should be helped along with other marketing channels, such as your social- and paid media. Social media can also lend credibility to your offerings or inspire potential customers to find out more about your offerings, therefore working hand-in-hand with SEO and your website. If your customers see you on social media, it might lead them to search for your brand using Google, with them then either finding a blog or article by a third party that leads them to your website. This is why the active promotion of your website becomes critical in this process. As we can see, SEO might be a complicated world to understand, but it has become part of our daily lives and influences us more than we like to admit. Getting your business out there and paying attention to SEO might just be the best decision you have ever made. by Shaun Scheepers, a Digital Specialist at MediaCom South Africa contentOpinionSEOwebsites « Lamborghini goes hi-tech Top 5 reasons to attend Education Innovation Summit 2017 » Search Tags Africa Airtel apple BlackBerry Broadband cloud cloud computing Egypt facebook Gadgets and Gaming Ghana Google Huawei ict ict news internet IT News IT News Africa IT Security kenya Microsoft Mobile Mobile and Telecoms MTN news Nigeria Nokia Opinion Safaricom samsung SAP Security Software South Africa tech news technology technology news Telecom telecom news telecoms Telkom Uganda vodacom west africa zimbabwe News Alerts Sign up for our FREE News Alerts       Like us In the news Forex Rates Latest Headlines Nigerians to suffer even poorer mobile service May 8, 2017 Top 5 reasons to attend Education Innovation Summit 2017 May 8, 2017 Don’t Strike Out with SEO May 8, 2017 Lamborghini goes hi-tech May 8, 2017 Tanzania: New money transfer service goes live May 8, 2017 Using Facebook Live for Talent Acquisition May 8, 2017   UPCOMING EVENTS   Education Innovation Summit 31 May 2017     IoT Forum Africa | 21-22 March 2018     Healthcare Innovation Summit 23 - 24 August 2017 Company Press Offices Press Offices Arbor Networks Condyn ContinuitySA Eset Fujitsu Huawei Interactive Intelligence MCI MTN OutSystems Resolve SAP Tom Tom USAASA Veeam Westcon-Comstor MOST POPULAR TWITTER Twitter Tweets by @ITNewsAfrica Photos on flickr Interview: Jasper Westerink CEO of Phillips Africa April 19, 2017 Top Female Tech Entreprenuer to Chair AfriLabs Board April 12, 2017 eBay Founder Pledges $100 Million In Fight Against Fake News April 6, 2017 Interview: Ross Hickey Of Trinity Telecom Discusses IoT April 4, 2017 SAP Africa appoints new Head of Innovation April 4, 2017 Twitter Mourns The Passing Of Ahmed Kathrada March 28, 2017 Interview: Dr Mumick of Kirusa discusses telecoms in emerging markets March 17, 2017 Interview: Underwriter Laboratories’s Steven Jackets discusses The Future of Authetication March 16, 2017 Microsoft announces new head for Middle East Africa March 2, 2017 SAS MD Desan Naidoo appointed VP for Africa February 23, 2017 Newsletter Would you like to receive the latest African technology news and analysis delivered to your e-mail inbox every morning?

Online media companies Google and Facebook now dominate global ad spend as they attracted 20% of global advertising revenue in 2016. According to reports by the CNBC these statistics have nearly doubled since 2012. Data and analysis agency, Zenith, released their top 30 Media Owners report which indicated the shift to online advertising, the report highlights that the increase in ad spend has seen the rise of online advertising, which has now overtaken television to become the worlds largest ad platform. The report also revealed that Google and Facebook dominate the market with Alphabet, Google’s parent company at number one, taking $79.4 billion, followed by Facebook, which earned $26.9 billion in advertising revenue. Twitter is the fastest-growing media owner, increasing ad revenue by 734% between 2012 and 2016 and is 30th on the list. According to reports by the Guardian, Internet-only media companies are now taking over the largest sectors of the online advertising market, while traditional news publishers have fallen far behind and been forced to make cutbacks. Besides Alphabet and Google there are five other pure internet media owners in the ranking: Baidu, Microsoft, Yahoo, Verizon and Twitter. Between them, the seven digital platforms generated $132.8bn of internet ad revenues in 2016.

Columnist Brian Patterson has some tips. Brian Patterson on May 8, 2017 at 9:30 am More “Position 0” is the new holy grail in organic search rankings. A normal position 1 ranking is great and all, but I’ll take an answer box that features my content (sometimes with an image) over position 1 in almost all cases. Just take a look at how attention-grabbing an answer box (also known as a “featured snippet”) is: With some of our own clients, we’ve seen click-through rates increase by as much as three times when one of their URLs that already ranks on page one suddenly gets an answer box. Once this started happening organically, it was like a drug — and we wanted more. So we set out to determine how we could get answer boxes for more queries. The first thing you must do, before anything else, is determine the keywords that are likely to generate answer boxes. At scale, this is impossible to do without a tool that tracks the SERPs and denotes which keywords have answer boxes. We use STAT for this, but many other tools are now tracking this as well. Once you understand where answer boxes currently show up, as well as manually review to see where they have the potential to, you can move on to prepping your data to optimize it for an answer box. The following are three strategies we are actively using with our clients that we’ve found to have an impact in generating answer boxes. 1. Structuring data properly There are a few types of content we see extracted most frequently out of our pages to populate answer boxes. They are: Ordered lists (OLs) Unordered lists (ULs) Paragraphs of text Data in tables Headings Ordered and unordered lists, as well as paragraphs, are pretty common in answer boxes, and you probably see them every day. For optimizing lists, you’ll want to use a heading tag above the list and give the list a title that closely matches the keyword you are targeting. That way, Google knows exactly what the list contains. Here is an example of an answer box generated from a list, where the source of the content has a big H2 title right above the list: Which is generated from this web page: Google also really loves to include tabular data when it makes sense for the query. As I see it, tables are really easy for computers to understand — much more so than natural language paragraphs. So, keep an eye out for opportunities to either add tabular content to your site or reformat existing content into tables. Wikipedia does a really good job of using tables and is often rewarded with answer boxes: Something we are seeing now, which was a little surprising, is that Google is building their own lists out of headings. Our client, Franchise Opportunities, was kind enough to let us share an example of an answer box that they currently receive. The page that powers the answer box looks like this: As you can see, there is actually no list on this page. Each box is about a company, and each company’s name is wrapped in an H2. Google extracts the H2s from the page and builds their own list in the answer box: Using this, we’ve formatted pages similarly for clients, leveraging headings when we can. Google seems to have gotten really good at grabbing these headings and making lists when no formal list exists. 2. Not giving it all away As the saying goes, people aren’t going to buy the cow when they can get the milk for free. The same goes with your answer boxes; if you give away the full solution in the answer box, you aren’t going to pull that searcher into your site. Take this answer box, for example: This gives you what you need straightaway, so if you are just looking to have some cursory knowledge on the topic, now you’ve got it — no click into the site needed. To get around this, we always try to add some extra (still helpful) steps so that Google doesn’t scrape your content and basically eliminate the need for you. We target eight steps, as Google will generally truncate after seven with a “More items…” link. Now, contrast the example above with this answer box below, where not all of the steps are displayed and you need to click through before you have the full answer: This list begs you to click through, which is the ultimate goal. 3. Use Google Search Console to re-crawl pages I’m not a fan of Google Search Console. I’m skeptical of most of the data is contains, and the constant bugs are disconcerting. That said, there is a feature that I am growing to love, even though I initially doubted it would work: requesting indexing. I thought that button was just too similar to the old “submit your site to Google” page, which I’m fairly certain moved you to the end of the crawl queue. But, as it turns out, the “request indexing” button does seem to almost instantly update Google’s index of the page. And, using it, we’ve seen answer boxes appear within the same day of updating content and requesting a re-index. So after you’ve updated your content to be well-positioned for an answer box, log in to Google Search Console. Expand the “Crawl” menu and click “Fetch as Google.” Plug in the page you edited and click “Fetch.” It will then be added to the table. Click “Request Indexing” next to the page in the table. I know you might be skeptical, and I do feel a little sales-y just typing those steps out, but it has honestly worked for us on more than a few occasions. Whether it works or is a placebo, we do it every time now and have seen some near-immediate changes in the SERPs that we never used to see before. Final thoughts Answer boxes are a new frontier in SEO. Everyone is trying to grab this relatively newly-created real estate because of its high value. However, Google is tinkering a lot with answer boxes, so expect a lot of volatility as you try your hand at your own land grab. But if you can make it work, answer boxes can be a great way to get new, relevant traffic.

The app has now been updated with a notification feature to warn you anytime you are about visiting any malicious website. The malicious emails were sent from contacts, asking people [Gmail account users] to open a Google Doc. Anyone who falls for this, is immediately asked to give authorizations to a fake Google Docs app. Granting such authorization, will give the sender [hacker] the permission to read, send, delete and manage email, as well as manage contacts. The most fearful aspect of this kind of attack is that authorization doesn’t look harmless; but the real danger is that the sender starts using the access granted to spread warms; even to other users. While the actual number of people affected by the attack is not immediately known or disclosed, it seems a lot of users were indeed affected. However, Google seems to have nipped it in the bud by revoking access granted to the app as well as snuffing life out of the phishing pages set up by the hacker. Sensing that revoking access granted to the app might not be enough, Google has updated its Gmail app for Android. The new update has taken the security level of the app one step higher than it was—you will now be notified with a warning when trying to phishing site from your mail. “This week, we’re introducing a new security feature in Gmail on Android to help you keep your email safer. When you click on a suspicious link in a message, Gmail will show a warning prompt helping you keep your account safe,” Google Said: The extra security feature is just one of several other security measures being taken to safeguard your account. Of course, not all emails can be tagged as malicious; it is, however, important to apply caution when clicking on any link added to every email you receive. Last March, Google issued a warning along with a reassuring letter; telling users to beware of government-backed attack. In the statement posted on the company’s website, Google said “government-backed attack may be trying to steal your password.” However, this warning also came with reassuring words; with the tech giant assuring users of the company’s readiness to protect accounts. Not that its [Google’s] policy has changed, but the statement on the company’s blog is just a reminder of the earlier warning it issued back in 2012. A couple of journalists had reported receiving such warnings especially since the last US election was concluded. In the warnings sent to some of these journalists, Google warned “that government-backed hackers may be trying to steal your password.” No word from Google if similar update will also be rolled out for iOS users; but Gmail app users for Android can now update their version of the app to secure their accounts.

This filtering feature allows AdWords users to target audiences by age, gender or even parental status on each of the AdWords networks — Search, Display or Video.  Demographic Targeting Using Google Profiles The Demographic Targeting feature can be accessed via the Audiences tab in AdWords. Users can then navigate to the Demographics subtab and switch between demographic data for age and gender using the two subtabs located under the graph. One data source that drives the Demographic Targeting function is activity from the profile settings of various Google accounts. For example, if an AdWords campaign attracts visitors who have Gmail or Google Plus accounts, those visitors are most likely candidates to be served relevant ads based on the stated interests their account profiles.   Social Targeting Becomes Mission Critical This kind of influence is not entirely new. Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest have long been using profile information to target their digital ads, and Bing added a demographic segment feature to its paid search platform back in 2015. So does that mean that Google is behind the curve in incorporating age and gender? Not necessarily. That’s because the role of social media in delivering the right offer to the right person hasn’t really been mission critical until now.  Now, the scale of social media’s impact on consumer behavior has reached a tipping point, with mobile devices and widespread internet access allowing consumers to access social media on the go and act on what they see.   Welcome to Social Search Reaching critical mass with enough consumers regarding social media as a reliable platform for product and service discovery has been key to the process of marketers updating their user personas and sales strategies to reflect social media’s richer data inputs.  That’s because, unlike search, consumer interests and activities are what power social ads. For example, Facebook ads are only displayed when an ad matches an interest reflected in a user’s profile or activity.  However, today those profile-related signals from social media have begun to appear as part of search. For instance, Pinterest users can set their Pinterest boards to be searchable by Google. Tweets can appear in Google search result as well, allowing not only for subject-matter insights but sentiment analysis as well.  More Accurate A/B Testing Another reason Google is incorporating age and gender is to create the potential for more accurate marketing campaign analysis using A/B testing. Traditionally, marketing campaigns have tested for conversion lift opportunities associated with keyword terms.  Now, with age and gender factored into AdWords, A/B testing can better account for demographic differences as it seeks to optimize the ads being served up in response to keyword searches.  The change also opens new possibilities for segment searches. For example, marketers of luxury leisure experiences such as cruises could target ads to specific age groups who might be more likely to have the necessary discretionary income.  More Innovations to Come Never content to rest on its laurels, Google plans to announce its “latest Ads, Analytics and DoubleClick innovations” on May 23, 2017 at a San Francisco event that will be livestreamed on its Inside AdWords blog, at 9:00 a.m. PDT/12:00 p.m. EDT.  Google promises that its announcement will share “innovations designed to improve your ability to reach consumers, simplify campaign measurement and increase your productivity. [Google also plans] a sneak peek at how brands are starting to use the Google Assistant to delight customers.”  In short, it’s a good bet that the Google has only begun to harness the power of social media for enhanced AdWords targeting.

Google and Apple were not named in the letter, which was sent to the European Commission. Arjun Kharpal | @ArjunKharpal 17 Hours AgoCNBC.com SHARES Internet companies like Google and Apple are abusing their power and scale, a number of European technology businesses such as Spotify have claimed. The chief executives of music streaming service Spotify, rival firm Deezer and Rocket Internet among others, sent a letter to the European Commission, the European Union's executive arm, claiming that online platforms "can and do abuse their privileged position". "Our collective experience is that where online platforms have a strong incentive to turn into gatekeepers because of their dual role, instead of maximizing consumer welfare," the CEOs wrote. Andrew Burton | Getty Images Daniel Ek, CEO and Founder of Spotify The Financial Times first reported the story on Friday, and Business Insider publishing a full copy of the letter on Monday. The European tech firms did not specifically name Google or Apple in the letter but referenced mobile operating systems, app stores, search engines, marketplaces and social media services as examples of the kind of platforms they take issue with. In one part of the letter, the CEOs said examples of platforms turning into gatekeepers include them "restricting access to data or interaction with consumers, biased ranking and search results to lack of clarity, imbalanced terms and conditions and preference of their own vertically integrated services." With Google dominating the search market in Europe and its Android mobile operating system along with Apple's iOS making up over 90 percent of the mobile market in the region, it's clear who the chief executives are singling out. Apple and Google were unavailable for comment when contacted by CNBC. The European Commission was also unavailable. The letter was sent to the commission ahead of a midterm review of the Digital Single Market, a policy aimed at harmonized rules across the bloc when it comes to policy around the digital economy. The review is scheduled for Wednesday. Apple and Spotify have clashed in the past. Last year, Spotify sent a letter to Apple accusing it of "causing grave harm" to the company and its customers by rejecting an update to the streaming service's iOS app. Spotify has also hit out against the 30 percent charge Apple has on payments made via iTunes. In July, the Swedish firm sent an email to remind customers it was cheaper to sign up to Spotify directly through the company's website than via the App Store.

This was a way to get Android N onto various devices ahead of the official launch while giving Google the means to check for bugs that were still prevalent. The program continued even after the official launch of Nougat and it seems that program will be coming to an end. However, the reason for the beta program coming to an end is so that Google can prepare to launch the first Android O Beta. Android O has already been in the hands of developers and enthusiasts alike, but this new beta program will be a ‘public’ version. The Android Beta Program’s landing page has not been updated with a specific date for the launch of the Android O public beta program, but we are expecting it to be soon. However, we could be waiting for another week and a half or so, as Google I/O 2017 is scheduled to get underway on May 17th. It would not surprise us if Google opened the floodgates during its Keynote event, where the company details everything that has been in the works for the last year.

Exclusive: Google is planning a 'Pixel 3' laptop running the 'Andromeda' OS for release in Q3 2017 David Ruddock Follow View All Posts 2016/09/26 7:02am PDTSep 26, 2016 358 Plus 1 on G+ 1116 Share on Facebook 412 Share on Twitter Total Shares1886 Exclusives Google Leaks News Rumors Two independent and reliable sources have confirmed to us that Google is planning a new Pixel laptop to be released in Q3 2017. The project, known internally as 'Bison' and by the informal nickname 'Pixel 3,' will likely be the first brand-new device to showcase Google's combined Android / Chrome OS 'Andromeda' operating system in a laptop form factor. Bison, then, would be the culmination of years of work by Google's Pixel team and Google's Android and Chrome OS teams. We are extremely confident Google plans for the device to run Andromeda. We are also confident that Andromeda is a completely distinct effort from Google's current campaign to bring Android apps to Chromebooks, and that Bison would not be marketed as a Chromebook. Android apps on Chrome OS descended from the ARC project, while Andromeda is a much larger, more ambitious initiative that is being pursued via merging Chrome features into Android, not vice versa. As such, it would be more accurate to say Bison will run Android than Chrome OS, and could finally be Google's internal commitment to releasing Andromeda. (This lines up with the narrative The Wall Street Journal presented in its exclusive about the merge effort last year, in which laptops were specifically singled out as the merged OS's first big target.) But before we get into details, let's discuss our confidence in this rumor. Unfortunately, this one is tricky. We are unable to share any primary source materials, including renders of any hardware. We also believe Bison's specifications, while we will provide them, are very much subject to change. Given it's a year or more from its planned release, Bison could evolve substantially or even be cancelled - so we want to be absolutely clear when we say that specifications are not set in stone. Let alone Bison's release being a certainty, especially if Andromeda runs into delays or the OS project sees a change of direction. But we're going to share what we can today, because it's just too interesting not to. And despite all of our asterisking in regard to future uncertainty, we are exceptionally confident that the information and sources we're working from are legitimate and trustworthy. As such, we're not assigning a number to this one - it's just not a good fit for that system. So, let's dive in. Bison is planned as an ultra-thin laptop with a 12.3" display, but Google also wants it to support a "tablet" mode. It's unclear to us if this means Bison will be a Lenovo Yoga-style convertible device, or a detachable like Microsoft's Surface Book, but I'm personally leaning on the former given how thin it is. Powering it will be either an Intel m3 or i5 Core processor with 32 or 128GB of storage and 8 or 16GB of RAM. This seems to suggest there will be two models. It will also feature a fingerprint scanner, two USB-C ports, a 3.5mm jack (!), a host of sensors, stylus support (a Wacom pen will be sold separately), stereo speakers, quad microphones, and a battery that will last around 10 hours. The keyboard will be backlit, and the glass trackpad will use haptic and force detection similar to the MacBook. Google plans to fit all of this in a form factor under 10mm in thickness, notably thinner than the aforementioned Apple ultraportable. Given the MSRPs of past Pixel laptops, you might expect this is shaping up to be one costly little device, and while not cheap, Google's planned pricing is still competitive: Bison is pegged to start at $799. As I said, the Wacom stylus would be sold separately, and Google is aiming for a retail launch in Q3 2017. And by the time Bison launches, Google wants to be ready to showcase Andromeda running a variety of enterprise, developer, and stylus-driven apps on the device - a way to argue that Bison and Andromeda will create a laptop experience that is truly attempting to rival Apple and Microsoft. So, if you were wondering why there wasn't a fresh Chromebook Pixel for 2016 (and we have no reason to think one is coming on October 4th), this is probably the reason. Chromebook Pixels may well be dead as of next year - Andromeda is the way forward. What do Bison and Andromeda mean for Android, and for Android phones and tablets? Well, right now: probably not much. Google will announce its Pixel smartphones on October 4th, and they will be running Android 7.1. Google may well tease Andromeda at this event. But the Pixel and Pixel XL, Google Home, Google Wifi, Daydream View, and the new Chromecast Ultra will likely remain the focus on that day, even if an Andromeda demo manages to steal the show. Here in 2016, Google is attempting to paint a vision of a united hardware front inside the company - to legitimize the idea that Google can build consumer hardware products to compete with the likes of Apple and Samsung (at least hypothetically). Andromeda will still be off on the horizon, but there's no doubt it's a huge piece of Google's long-term strategy puzzle. But this same time next year? I think it's likely we'll see Google show us the first laptop with the power of Android and the best of Chrome OS, a truly watershed moment for Android and Google. Whether the resultant operating system, even if it is largely powered by Android underneath, will still be called Android isn't something I could hope to guess at. Maybe Google doesn't even know. But as to what it means for Chromebooks? I think the Journal had it dead on a year ago: Chrome OS and Chromebooks (perhaps with a new name) will continue, but Android with Chrome OS features baked-in, aka Andromeda, is the new hotness, and will mark a major shift in Google's OS strategy. All I can say is I really hope we get a taste of what that future looks like next week.

Pixel C has some good specs and Google may even push this update to them in 2017 PVL_93_RU Congrats for beta testing Rita El Khoury Is the "Shut up and take my money" meme too outdated now? Because I feel it'd be super appropriate here. Carson Saldanha Omg Stakoman I don't like these kind of leaks/rumors but fuck me... I got excited about this Kristian Ivanov I will take your money, but I'm not sure how this will help you get one of these. PVL_93_RU well... you can order it for her and then send it straight to Rita's house? Kristian Ivanov This is exactly what I will do. Can I has cash now plz?

What i do understand that Google aims to give people with android phones the ability to Use Continuity the same way Apple does with their devices. The question is, can Google compete with true OS computer with their price tag? Aaron Given how rotten the Windows store is, I'd say it's chances are good. I have a Windows 10 convertible now and should have just saved my money. nirmitlamed I think that we should first look at the price tag. Right now Chrombook Pixel cost 1299$. With that kind of price tag most people would choose Macbook air which start at 899$ price tag and it has better OS and good support. You can even go with 13-inch MacBook Pro with Retina display at the same price tag (1299$). Now If we talk about PC laptops it has even more variety. For my opinion if the price tag remains high don't see how people will prefer Android+ChromeOS over true OS like Apple OS and Windows. Greyhame Their plans are to demo it with enterprise software. In other words, in their minds, it would be a "true OS". Aaron With a starting price at $799, I would give it a shot. What it can do as a productivity device is yet to be seen, of course, but even before being properly announced it's already better than Windows 10 as a 2 in 1. And iPad Pro is just iOS blown up to tablet size, which I only mention because there are no 2 in 1 MacBook options. Tl;dr If done right Andromeda could be big. It won't overthrow Windows or MacOS, but it could take a nice piece of the pie. deppman Just curious, how do you define a "true OS"? Is it one that allows complete control of your hardware? Too bad OSX, Windows, OS2, and virtually every OS ever released doesn't make the cut. Is installed user base important and number of applications? If they are, then Android far outpaces all other OS's on both fronts. Maybe its the ability to recompile the kernel and write optimized device drivers? Whoops, none of these commercial OS's allow that. Maybe its the fact that "real" OS's don't try to lock you into an ecosystem? Except, of course, Apple and MS are definitely guilty of that with iOS, OSX, Windows 10, and Windows phone. Maybe a "real OS" doesn't phone home and send keystrokes back to company servers? Oh whoops, there's Windows 10 again. According to these criteria the only "true OS's" available are various *nix distributions. So what precisely IS the criteria for a "real OS" that you are referring to? shadowx360 Not of that matters for the consumer and business that wants to get work done. I think he means a versatile OS that can run on at least laptops, desktops, and maybe servers with full featured third party software support. Basically macOS, not iOS. Something you can run a full version of Word and Photoshop on, something you can take to work and do everything you can do on a Windows or macOS machine. I can see Andromeda only really succeeding if it gets third party support or finds a way to run full featured Windows or Linux apps. Otherwise it's just the equivalent of a glorified iPad Pro. nirmitlamed You already knows what i mean you just stuck on maybe wrong choice of words. What i mean about "True OS" is the ability to do the most simple tasks and in the same time to have the ability to do a more complicity tasks for power users. I am sure you can figure out yourself what is the difference between Android+Chrome OS and Windows or Mac OS. deppman My point is there really isn't much of a difference between Android+ChromeOS vs. W10 or OSX. And what little difference exists is being systematically removed by Apple and MS respectively. They're all OSs locked into curated ecosystems. At the same time, Android and Chrome, both being OSS, have a vibrant community that allow Android to do many things that OSX and Windows can't, even without rooting or stepping outside of the Google store. My Pixel C, for example, is in many ways more capable than a MacBook Air. What you haven't figure that out for yourself yet is that your criteria for what constitutes a "real" OS are nebulous, quaint, and out of date. nirmitlamed First of all i would very love to hear about what you can do better with your Pixel C that you can't do on MacBook Air for example. About the criteria "real" OS, again don't be stuck on maybe wrong choice of words. I don't, so neither should you. For my opinion Chromebooks are for specific kind group of people and not for everyone. There are a lot of apps missing that were built over the years in Windows and MacOS from video player to editing to games and download managing and so on. Android OS is great but please don't compare its apps ecosystem to Windows and MacOS apps. Every company that has its app on different OS, build its android app to match the main idea how would one use its app on the way in the palm of their hand. There is a different between sitting on a chair in-front a computer than using your small mobile devices on the couch, bathroom and on the way. That is one of the reasons why you won't find all the same features in every OS. Surely what google is planing to its computer line is very interesting but could it really compete with Windows and Mac? i doubt that. Since you own a ChromBook computer i would love to hear your thoughts on that. Can ChromeOS do every task Windows and MacOS can? Mayur Gondhalekar I agree with you that Chrome OS is a limited OS with a specific usecase. I own a chromebook since 2 years and its my go to device for simple tasks like websurfing or streaming and even light stuff like creating word documents or excel etc. (Google docs works with conversion to MS word or excel in the end). Where it trumps Windows is its always on nature and simplicity. I never have to deal with slow moving OS or a update pop up every now and then. Especially on some new budget Win PCs you have only 32GB storage and that Win 10 update keeps killing these devices. Now if with a new OS designed for laptops, Google can create the experience of MAC then it can surely ba a hit. I dont ever see windows as competition when it comes to performance. But in terms of app availibilty, it would have to match Windows and Mac. But if it does then who knows...Honestly for stuff like playing videos or music etc most people are moving to streaming services where you do not really need native apps. What remains is work related apps and media editing apps. Skunky As you said, chromebooks are designed for certain people, or maybe even as a secondary "grab and go" computer for Mac or Windows users. the main people that will use chrome os are perhaps students (depending on what their needs are), older people who need something simplistic, people who just want to type documents, browse the web, play web based games (and future android games), facebook video chat (and use other messengers when android apps become available), photo editing (there are some pretty nice photo editors in the web store, and soon to be with android), for people who don't need all of the extras that Windows or Mac comes with. I don't know why some people have to be 1 sided, why can't people learn to evolve and find ways to use a new OS without bashing it- challenge yourself to do what you normally do on your Mac or Windows 'but on a different platform' in an alternative way. (i've learnt how to do some neat things on my chromebook and with computers in general that i wouldn't have learnt if i would have just stuck with Windows and hadn't challenged myself). VAVAMk_2 We can define what a real desktop OS isn't at least: iOS Keith Earns I second this. Criticizing google for not licensing windows or mac OS on their new laptop is ridiculous. They have an OS based off a linux kernel, linux I would classify as a "TRUE OS". Chromebook linux support has been decent, I have no reason to believe the new pixel would not support linux, and for that price it pouts some nice hardware. "Productivity" arguments are still being made? Docs/sheets/slides is really comparable to office, and if you're an editor you're probably using WP anyway so whats the problem? Glaiket Anne Clyde The burning question as to what constitutes a True OS is a subject fraught with perplexity and often extremely difficult to discern. At present my thoughts on this often controversial subject are mine and mine alone, however, for the sake of whatever i offer the following. Take any clean OS then inject with say that old favorite of theirs the sasser virus, disinfect to a certain degree, then lay back and listen to the sound it makes as it crashes through a neighbors sunroof from your penthouse geek caves. Smoke a fag, tweek ,twerk eat repeat. In no time at all you will be listening to the pitter patter of tiny zx81's romping all over your once blissfull lives. Dale Upton Wow, he meant like a laptop dude not a tablet, somthing robust enough to compete with mac os and windows, I can help you off that high horse is you like? Comment_Cop None of these things define an OS but yeah I get it, you want more control. So do I when it comes to Windows. Drew Ciccotelli I remember when people didn't pay less than 2000 for a new MacBook Pro. Drew Ciccotelli Why anyone has a Windows 10 machine now is beyond me. I'm on an XP at work and it's running the Chrome browser like a champ. Aaron I wanted a 2-in-1 so I would only have to carry one device when I travel, as opposed to a laptop and tablet, and I still needed Windows' software compatibility. Money not well spent. I would have been happier with two devices. I wanted to give 10 a chance, and 10 has been a headache. Drew Ciccotelli 10 is just them wanting to be Google but still having that Mircosoft pay to play bug up their ass. Drew Ciccotelli It's too ad heavy and Internet reliant. James Briano Oh, c'mon. We all know you're typing on one right now. Chris Why? What will this do that a surface can't? Run some android games? Nicholas Conrad Surface Pro 3 (i5) was such a disappointment it's what convinced me to try a Chromebook in the first place. Chris That's funny I went the opposite direction. I loved my chromebook but it hit a wall in usability so I switched to surface and it's been amazing. Charlie I almost can't think of any reason I'd prefer a Chromebook over a tablet with a very good add-on keyboard/sleeve/case/stand with a Bluetooth keyboard (and mouse). Except for price? Because there are some extremely cheap Chrome books out there. Drew Ciccotelli You mean a Pixel C then. Charlie For $499, it ain't bad. But I still feel like it won't be beating Android when it comes to apps and versatility. But I do like the design, yes. That hardware plus Android, I'd be willing to at least test that out for a couple of months. Definitely. Nicholas Conrad It was too big and heavy to use as a tablet for any length of time, and the type-cover kickstand combination made it precarious at best as a laptop substitute. The type-cover itself was a pretty terrible typing experience, and the offset trackpad, while probably comfortable for right-handers, was incredibly cramped and awkward to use as a left-hander. The SP4 type cover improved in those areas somewhat. Windows 10 has gotten a lot better over time, but at launch there were several driver issues with it that were super frustrating being MS hardware. Not least of which was it would often go completely dark when removed from the dock, requiring a hard reset to wake again. With no status LEDs, even performing a reset on it was oddly difficult and frustrating. The only thing that was genuinely awesome about it was the pen, but that only ever really worked in onenote. And all of that comming in at several hundred dollars more than an equivalently speced mac, which I used to mock for being so overpriced.... Yeah, I bought a $200 redurb Dell Chromebook, and have been much happier with a real keyboard and which I can actually use on my lap. I gave the surface back to work and just used the Chromebook instead. It works as well as, or better than Windows for 95% of everything I need to do. Occasionally I run into CrOS limitations, but I have an old Windows box I can boot up when needed. Drew Ciccotelli What did the Chromebook cost and how much was the Surface? Charlie How about just run Android in general. With the ease of use and versatility of all that Android has to offer: not only things like the Play Store support with all it's apps but maybe also more manufacturers willing to take the plunge and invest and make these type of devices? And how about price? Some people are also just done with Windows. And all it's iterations/versions. I'm one of them. I'll go with Android (Remix OS for instance) and Ubuntu any day over WIndows 10. But that's a matter of taste, even so, still means I'd prefer Andromeda over Windows 10. Chris You're sick of all the different versions and you're going to android...not the best choice. I don't see myself being able to use android for work in the foreseeable future. I used a chromebook for 75% of my master's degree until it just literally was not possible to use anymore and I got a cheap SP3 and man that thing is just amazing. Charlie But... Things might be looking a bit different in a year, when this comes out? Which is why they might be developing it? Plus, it depends on what your needs are. I have a work PC at work. Which will either be Windows or macOS. I know some companies that have been trying Ubuntu though. It depends on what type of job you have, if Windows is really necessary. But for personal use. I think I could get by fine on Android. Chris For sure android will do everything for personal use for me also. I dunno. We've been told so many times the updates would get better I've given up. Remember the update alliance? hahaha Charlie That's true. But Pixel does indicate Nexus, which means with this specific device... You might be alright. Plus Google could try and pull an Android Wear/Auto on us... Hardware (with minimum requirements) left up to device manufacturers, but software updates are handled by (mostly) Google. juanjeremy2012 why not just a plain laptop Deckard_Cain Just wish they would also include a dedicated GPU. :( AMD's open-source drivers for Linux are even in great shape. xsilas43 AMD does not develop for the mobile platform, so for the laptop maybe but not in the width they are going for. Dan Gul Zen platform might change that. We might see AMD in these in the second iteration of these machines. Who knows. Depends on how well AMD executes on Zen. Kian Ronald Grey LOL Thats a joke. Jay T Intel's iGPU's are now pretty fast and efficient. My current laptop has an i5-6200U with a HD520 GPU, and it can play fairly intense games at 1080p without breaking a sweat. Also, when not doing anything intense I get 6-10 hours of battery life. techfreak243 it's never outdated. PVL_93_RU It's too good to be outdated Evan Nope! Here you go: http://www.reactiongifs.us/shut-up-and-take-my-money/ Pedram Haghzaban So, is there any thing good for Pixel C? ConCal Finally something new and exciting from Google. Borgman https://media.giphy.com/media/RNSpxCwwbl5Vm/giphy.gif John http://i.imgur.com/AC6KSFn.gif Good_Ole_Pinocchio AP is crushing with the leaks... As usual... but I WANT IT!.... No I haven't read the Article yet, but I want it! aliablow It's been a while since Google managed to spark genuine interest and anticipation. But this... What a time to be alive, indeed! So much hype for the 4th! Ash At this rate, I'm convinced Google is going to stop sending you invites to press events if you keep leaking their major plans like this. Rita El Khoury That's one option. The other is that Google secretly hates to love AP or loves to hate it. John Doe It is not the AP, the problem is with Google. The WSJ already leaked this a while back so Google needs to control their employees. Bewear I know this might sound pointless, but I hope you can install the OS of your preference on it. John Doe Will Andromeda be the next version of Android? Meaning, will the Pixel phones and other devices will be upgraded to it and have all the devices under one OS or like Apple (macOS, OSx, etc.)? aliablow If Android becomes Andromeda, I can only imagine the level of fragmentation. Perhaps Google found a way to tackle that issue once and for all with seamless updates similar to Chromebooks. One can only hope. Just_Some_Nobody Google needs to drop the Java runtime and go with something else. This might be a good time to do it. They could keep the old java runtime as a backwards compat. layer, but kill it for all new development. Midas Gordon-Farleigh I'm just wondering when you guys are going to rename to Andromeda Police. Todd At least they won't need to change the AP logo. L3Chiffre Domain name "andromedapolice.com" was registered yesterday... devilfriend lol seriously though, I wonder how many XDA-Developers users know what an XDA is. PVL_93_RU Well it derived from PDA (Personal Digital Assistant) so I guess the XDA has a same meaning? JL Maybe Andromeda is Android 8. Leonard Wong Getting poor @ 2017 Rita El Khoury You're waiting until 2017 to get poor? I'm getting poorer way before. SimonSaid 8 days, to be precise. bdbplatano That seems like forever away, can't wait. 😬 SimonSaid Does AP have any idea whether this is solely a laptop OS or whether it is ultimately destined for phones and tablets too? David Ruddock It's hard to know without having a much more detailed understanding of Google's vision, and we just don't. If I were to speculate, I'd say that there'd be a single OS Google will push commercially (maybe still called Android), and that certain devices like laptops and large tablets would be able to use certain features that would particularly benefit their form factor (like Chrome OS's windowed operation). Even if it this stuff would be baked into every Android device, some of it would only be exposed for certain hardware / interfaces. This could also allow for Continuum style functionality a la Windows 10, where your phone could "project" a desktop operating environment. But again: that is complete speculation. I doubt even Google fully understands where they want to go with this yet. SimonSaid Thanks, David. I suppose what everyone wants to know is whether this will finally solve Android's 'Update Problem'. Hopefully we'll soon learn enough about Andromeda's architecture to answer this question. All aboard the hype train! Alex I personally hope the codename Andromeda lives on to production. Such a cool name. Roger Siegenthaler And that google doesn't know yet is scary, MS knew over 10 years ago when they started minwin and dropped development of CE that they wanted to get one OS/Kernel on all devices and it still took them so long and numerous restarts to get there. Now how many restarts and how long does it take a company without a plan now to achieve this. David Ruddock I'm not a developer or engineer (obviously), but I think the smartphones of today are a lot more like laptops than the smartphones (and proto-smartphones) of 10 years ago. Microsoft was trying to solve a much harder problem there - bringing an ancient OS never designed for mobile to mobile. Android already does x86 and ARM, and it uses the Linux kernel. I don't think there's much to stop Android from running on a laptop (hell, Android laptops, crappy ones, exist), so much as there hasn't been a good reason to run it on a laptop. I don't really think the projects are comparable - Google's is much more a question of "why" than "how." Roger Siegenthaler That's assuming Linux is really capable of what NT is now, which I have serious doubts about considering google's public dumping of linux for embedded/IoT tech and is trying to replace it with fuchsia on every platform. I have the feeling if the world's largest user of a kernel says (paraphrased) "this kernel does not scale well" you're going to believe them and not just say that linux can do so with no problems. It's definetely easier for google then for MS but not so much that the engineering part is "easy" Syukri Lajin that is why google work on more than 1 projects at the same time :P no actual direction, just see which work the best, kill the others, start new projects with slightly different objective, and repeat. Justin W So, Honeycomb vs. Gingerbread. Got it. On a serious note, I'd love some continuity features. Google seems to be going in the wrong direction with that when it comes to their messaging app (Allo), but I'm hoping they're truly working to better that and the overall continuity features in Android. Defenestratus RIP Android? demarcmj Probably just those RIP to those Android quasi-laptop, tablet-with-keyboard things that like 10 people ever bought anyway. Defenestratus Yeah I'm a kickstarter backer of the superbook which has real appeal for me. Not so sure anymore. philosopher_Mk More like RIP Chrome os, this is Android for laptops. Suicide_Note Maybe. Just maybe. bdbplatano I wonder how this all fits in (if at all) with fuchsia ConCal RIP Jide Carson Saldanha Lol yep 😂 Google coming directly at Remix OS. Tho Remix works on Windows/Mac PCs so... Stephen Sharp I mean, after all, Google Drive killed Box, Google+ killed Facebook, Google Docs killed Office Quite frankly, Google has a history of killing nothing except its own products XD Ace killed all but fb AJE Google Doc did not kill Office. Office is still the king especially in business. jesuguru He forgot the /s ConCal I mean those are a bit different. Jide isn't Microsoft or Facebook. Jide just got off the ground this year.

Don't take my credit away! I coined the term... Now i shall collect my 10 cents for every mention. PVL_93_RU It's Master, not Major Qbancelli I have a hard time getting excited about something that won't launch for at least a year. bort118 I don't!! AHHHH!! bdbplatano Especially when dealing with Google thartist Maybe not everything is about GETTING EXCITED. But yeah, it might be that far because Andromeda needs some time yet to reach 1.0 Diego Opazo SV-Cross ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ This is going to be amazing!!!! Dmitriy Romanov These leaks are going really out of hand. There is no surprises anymore just because someone from google leaks all shit to AP. Nayners People want leaks, then don't want leaks. Your comment type gets old. You can't have your cake and eat it too. You do realize that AP is in the business of providing news/leaks? And news they have brought. Thanks, AP! aliablow Actually for me, these leaks actually pique interest cause a lot of the details are unknown. Think of these as a teaser or a trailer for a movie. Dmitriy Romanov Yeah. Nowadays movie trailers can tell everything about movie and even main plot. Thats what AP is doing with these exclusives Jarrett Lennon Kaufman How awful of them to dare release news that, if they didn't, someone else would. Awful of them to do their jobs. Dan It will then be discontinued in Q1 2018 when Google pivots to a new strategy of running [insert new software here] on [insert new device here]. Such is the experience of those who buy Google's consumer devices thinking, "No, really, this time Google is really committed to this product line!" Defenestratus Yes. So much this. PerhapsNever But, there are actually quite a few of their products that they are still supporting (and enhancing)... Chromecast, for instance. Nope.jpeg What did the Chromebook say to the Pixel 3? "Bison." Cod3rror I have to agree. One thing that Apple has that neither Google nor Microsoft (new MS) has is that Apple comes up with a long term plan and sticks to it and so far their long term visions setup by Steve Jobs have been on point. With Google everything is in beta. And with Microsoft, it's always "wait for the next version, that one will be great!". Sk0ly The one thing Apple has is users that will literally buy any piece of crap they roll into their apple store showcase. Cod3rror What a foolish thing to say. Whether you like to admit or stick your hand in the sand and deny, is that Apple makes very good products. iPhone is still the gold standard for quality. The same with Mac, the same with Macbook, iPad (Android tablets. Remember them?), watch (remember the beta version Android watches?). Sk0ly Apple makes good quality devices overall, I won't deny that but I wouldn't call them a "gold standard" at this point. They have had issues related to quality on the last three iPhones. Bendgate where your phone bends under normal use, antennagate where you are "holding it wrong". And yes, I think the use of gate in every issue is dumb. I actually disagree that the Apple watch is a superior product. The OS is really terribly thought out and yet it is the best selling. Why? Because it is Apple. Bottom line, Apple users will buy whatever Apple tells them to. That is a general statement but rings very true. The company was so arrogant that they thought they could sell a $15,000 Apple Watch. On the software front, it is a really bad situation. Apple Maps is absolute garbage (although it has improved) and Apple Music is still a way crappier service with Apps that aren't on par with Spotify or Google Music. The point I was making is that they force people to buy products, adaptors, accessories to stay within their ecosystem. They preach sustainability but use proprietary connectors and force people to buy overpriced adapters that add to e-waste globally. The Macbook is a nice piece of hardware but I'm sorry, OSX is not as good of an OS as Windows. It seems to have cornered a niche in design and editing but anyone who knows computers will tell you about its limitations. As far as tablets go you are correct. Android tablets have not delivered and the iPad ecosystem has flourished as a result. Bottom line, Apple is not perfect, far from it. Cod3rror Apple is not perfect, but it's the closest one to it out of three (Apple, Google, Microsoft). Apple sells expensive products, everybody knows that. You pay for tech + "luxury", they simply would not be able to sell cheap products, look at iPhone 5c. As for the ecosystem, you either go by Apple's ecosystem or you don't get an Apple product. If you use the product the way Apple intended it to be used, you'll really enjoy it and have a great time, that's what most people do and they are quite happy about it. I personally don't, so I don't use Apple products. But for an average person, Apple is the easiest, most seamless experience out there. Apple also provides the easiest backup/restore functionality, something that Google still does not properly do. Next, let's talk about support, if you buy an iPhone, you will get support for at least 4 years, this is something no Android or Microsoft phone can claim. Hell, Google does not even support Nexus properly, as I mentioned, everything is a beta with them. At any moment they might change their mind, or scrap it and do something else, there is no feeling of stability. As for services, Google has a huge lead on Apple on services, which are not Apple's strong point. But Google's own services work better and are better designed on Apple's products. I cannot comment about OSX itself, just the hardware, so I will take your word for it. Personally, I don't have much interest in it, and I too prefer Windows to OSX and even to Linux. However, most people that I know that tried OSX, switched. Finally, Apple innovates, even though many people don't like to admit it, they do push things forward. They pushed the retina screen, they pushed the fingerprint sensor, etc... Watch as future phones have pressure sensitivity and haptic feedback. Hrishikesh Bisen Well actually Android Watch OS is wrost in all Watch OS Sk0ly Let's try that again in English Charlie Well, Android is here for 8 years isn't it? And Nexus phones/Pixel products are also still being supported? No? AlRegals Google TV...... Sk0ly Bad example. Google TV was ahead of its time and the Cablecos were the ones who murdered that platform, not google. If we are doing a comparison, how about the Microsoft Courier or Windows Phone 7 or Apple with the Newton. PVL_93_RU Android TV is dead too though Sk0ly Hahaha you are joking right? You realize like 80% of television manufacturers this year are shipping TVs running Android TV right? On top of that, google is aggressively backing the Xiaomi mii box. I do wish for a pixel player one day though. Hrishikesh Bisen Where did you get this figures, Although I'm sure Samsung and LG doesn't support Android TV. Sk0ly Sony, Sharp, Philips, Vizio, RCA, Hisense, etc. I'll admit that stat was a bit overzealous when considering Samsung Smart TV and the recently purchased WebOS for LG. With that said, Sony, Philips, and Sharp sell a lot of TVs and Android tv is a way better experience. I love my Nexus player, albeit a bit buggy but would love to see a pixel branded Android tv box but I doubt that would happen. Sk0ly OK, maybe 80% was pushing it but the list of OEM's is very long. Sony, Sharp, Philips, Hisense, Vizio, TCL, RCA, Bang & Olafsen, Vestel, Arcelik Pretty much the only major manufacturers not on board are LG because they bought WebOS from HP and have invested in it, Samsung because they have years of investment into their platform, and Panasonic because they don't care about a decent smarttv platform. Of that list, the first three sell a lot of TV's (Sony/Sharp/Philips) and the smaller vendors are on the rise. https://www.statista.com/statistics/267095/global-market-share-of-lcd-tv-manufacturers/ Samsung & LG combined for about 30% of the market last year and are on the decline. Having used all three platforms, Android TV is by far the best experience. Android TV added a ton of OEM's this year and I expect that to continue as Samsung and LG will not be able to compete on developers. This is because A. There is already a large community of Android Developers so they don't need to learn to code for a new platform and B. It will be on more brands, reducing the need to create a variety of different apps for different platforms. Charlie So we agree that it can go either way? thartist You're quite right, but at least at this point it's not about branching into unnecessary experiments like ChromeOS, but converging OSs. And in the end it all aims to converge on Fuchsia, the one for all, like Microsoft did with Windows 8+. browngeek Port it to the Pixel C already! David Ruddock It's already been said to us that Google is using Pixel C as a test platform for Andromeda (as 9to5G said, they also used N9, but we think they've moved on), but before people go nuts: that doesn't necessarily mean anything in terms of Pixel C ever getting Andromeda officially. browngeek Juicy! Read on Android Authority that the N9 was being tested, but no mention of the Pixel C. Faheem Ahmed ONLY IF THEY MAKE ANDROID SO POWERFUL....THAT IT COULD RIVAL WINDOWS 10(AMAZING FEATURES AND SOOOO MUCH SETTINGS AND STUFF) THEN someone755 I think Microsoft crippled Windows 10 enough that you'd only need support for running Windows programs (Steam, Adobe CS, Office etc.) and enough drivers to support the majority of today's devices to take over people's computers with your own OS. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Crippled in what way, exactly? Windows 10's their best desktop OS yet. Andromeda will need to rival it for me to switch. someone755 For me, every way. There is nothing better in w10 than in w8.1. The Start menu is a mess, the updates are just horribly executed ("Hey, do you want this upda-- TOO LATE WE INSTALLED IT ALREADY AND REMOVED A PROGRAM YOU WERE USING"), the fact they're trying to force their mobile apps in a desktop environment by making a crippled Settings app etc. I miss Charms, the Start screen, and a less-shitty version of Windows Update, along with a better Control Panel. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Interesting. I've found it to be consistently better in nearly every way except for tablet experience, which I rarely use, and which has been improved dramatically anyway. You're literally the first person I've seen prefer 8.1. Normally everybody hates 8.x with a passion for irrational reasons. someone755 I really don't understand the hate. Compared to Windows 7, so little was changed, -- other than some minor design tweaks, the Start screen and Charms, very little was changed -- and it could easily be used as a desktop platform, without the silly apps and Store being shoved down your throat. And most of the Settings app's options were still available through the Control Panel and elsewhere. I don't get who dictates to these people what to like and what to religiously hate, but there has got to be a site or magazine that tells people what's popular right now. Because there is no reason why people would just unanimously agree that something sucks this much. Roger Siegenthaler Ignoring all the group policies and enterprise related stuff what you're suggesting is still a massive amount of work. Let alone the driver part is a massive issue. Lare2 All sound nice ..... But where's Allo .? someone755 Allo? You mean the already released and lame chatting app? Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Allo? On the Play Store already? Lare2 I guess a "/s" was necessary .. LOL Suicide_Note https://media1.giphy.com/media/g1xNFWSvnnFJu/giphy.gif jesuguru ...for liposuction Suicide_Note Among other things. blindexecutioner What the pixel C should have been. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman And likely was supposed to be. Stevie_Wonder Teasing it the 4th, presenting it start of next year, telling us it will release soon at the end of next year, buying it in Q2 of 2018 and a year or 2 later the whole thing is abandoned. I really hope not, but one can not be a bit pessimistic with all the stuff Google is doing and not doing anymore. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman This is a touch different from some communications app. This sounds like the entire direction of the most successful software platform Google has, combined with the second most successful software platform Google has. Stevie_Wonder I totally agree. Wasn't referring to only the communication-app-maze Google is dropping it's users in. But with all the name changes (Nexus to Pixel, Chromecast to Cast) and the doubt around support (will the old Nexus get the new updates from 7.1 and the launcher the Pixels will get) and slow release of products around the world, Google isn't really strong in building a lifetime platform. Except, over time, with Android. Chrome OS still has to prove itself in my eyes and while I really hope this is going to work, I think they should've done this from the start.. and with announcing things way ahead of release, the hype train goes to another station. Yes, combining their most successful software platforms (do they have others?) sounds great, but they should've done it earlier and should already be able to bring it out, instead of a year later. Grimmjow Meh krazyfrog Hardware aside, what sort of third party app ecosystem are we talking about here? The laughable Android tablet apps? The utterly hilarious Chrome OS "apps"? Or something completely new? Jarrett Lennon Kaufman The former, but with a push to make them actually happen. philosopher_Mk Probably Android apps + desktop version of Chrome browser. PVL_93_RU That's Chrome OS TedPhillips and GoogleTV alexg Yeah what about the watches?? Justin W Well, considering Chromebooks run Android apps and they look just fine (you'll recall that Android 7.0 added easy resizability, I'm sure), I'd expect Android appsand Chrome (with all it's extensions and apps) in a desktop-browser version. Andrew Bone And it's all built on Fuchsia... Right? bdbplatano That's what I was wondering too. Surely they have to have some kind of interplay philosopher_Mk Nope,have you read the article ? Andrew Bone Yes, Android is built on top of the Linux platform (as is Chrome OS). I was just wondering if they might swap that out for Fuchsia. David Ruddock No. It's built on Android. Andrew Bone So Linux (as the underbelly of Android) could not be swapped out with Fuchsia? I just presumed that would be the only reason google would start at the bottom and work their way up. Carson Saldanha He didn't read ur article lol Captain_Invisible That's IoT... right? Jarrett Lennon Kaufman I would personally wager that a break from the Android name might come with this. Because if this is going to be a desktop-class OS, then the entire control of updates and other factors needs to shift to Google for the first time for ALL devices. That requires a fundamental rethinking of how the OS works with OEMs and how it's presented to consumers from them, which to me would justify a new name so people can confidently recognize the difference. Captain_Invisible Andromeda would be such a cool name, but I doubt it's going to be anything but a code name. Jared I dunno, if you squint real hard you can combine Android and Chrome to make And-rome-da or Andr-ome-da. Basically Android+Chrome?... Da (Russian for yes). jesuguru Chrandroid? _jsw_ Bison Savings Account: Activated! (if it's a dud, I can always buy the 2018 Pixel XXL) Yura Kazimirov Can it run Overwatch is the real question! David Prieto "Via merging Chrome features into Android, not vice versa" So, what type of features are we talking about? David McClellan I'm assuming this is multiwindow support, not just split screen. An application "dock" as opposed to a launcher, and extension support I would assume. Also having access to ChromeOS/Desktop Chrome API's would be awesome for webapp integration. David Prieto What API again? philosopher_Mk Desktop ui,desktop browser, seamless updates , better right click support, multi window . David Prieto Yeah, those seem to make sense and are already on their way to being implemented, or don't look like they'd be a lot of work But then it wouldn't be "merging" Android and Chrome OS, as much as turning Android into a usable desktop system and ditching Chrome OS. Would it? philosopher_Mk Yes, I guess they are just making Android more usable desktop system and ditching Chrome os. It makes sense , Android is their most successful product since Google search. David Ruddock We'd like to know, too! But at this point, we don't. David Prieto It can be fun to speculate tho :-P Jason Allen They already did the boot feature. Maybe the other features are security features like the chrome OS reboot to reset everything. David Ruddock Sure - seamless updates is definitely the first big one. Itchy_Robot Let us know if you hear anything about better security updates. I really love how my 8 year old Asus windows 7 (updated to Win10 for free) still gets security updates. I hope Google is trying to eventually move to that model rather than the "2.5 years and your out" model they currently have. The way the OS is structured now relies on 3rd parties implementing the security updates rather than Google pushing it directly to the user. I hope one day Google can get their OS in shape to handle 'direct to the consumer' security updates. Captain_Invisible Updates. Zaptor99 Google is exhausting !!!! Carson Saldanha I have a feeling it'll be like the Surface Pro's. It'll run full Android in tablet mode and Chrome OS in laptop mode. b_boogey_xl Is this how they plan on taking control of Android? By making another OS but this time they have full control over it… 🤔 J3R3MY_H Not sure what Andromeda does for me that Android apps in ChromeOS doesn't do. Hopefully I'll understand better next week. a.d.AM And why do I want this? What will it do that Android or Chrome OS hasn't done? I've never once said "oh, I have to pull out my Chromebook to take care of this task." This will flop just like Allo. Stephen Sharp People have been pushing for Android as a desktop OS since before it was even really a tablet os pfmiller It's never made sense to me why people have wanted that though. Neither the OS nor the apps are well suited to desktop use. Stephen Sharp How so? I grant you the chicken & the egg problem of scalable Android apps, but I believe that's what Android apps are for on ChromeOS - a trojan horse, or a red carpet, getting developers to get their apps ready for this But, how is Android not suited for a desktop besides UI (which will be solved when Google actually ships Android for a particular formfactor and not before) pfmiller It's just designed for a touch screen which does not make for a good desktop experience. Sure, you can rework the whole interface of the OS and apps to make them work on a desktop, but why? There are already desktop OSs and applications that do everything you need. Stephen Sharp Why have the same ecosystem for your Laptop, Phone, Tablet, Car, TV (Console for me thanks to Shield), and Watch, pay-once-run-everywhere? No no you're right I don't know what I was thinking :P Stephen Sharp That's still just UI. Nothing inherently wrong with the OS for Desktop use. And if Jide (the behemoth that it is) can make Android work nice on a desktop, surely Google can. As for why, buy-once-run-everywhere apps. Also, Android is awesome because reasons thats why mattcoz It will hopefully deliver a full-fledged desktop OS, that's what Android and Chrome OS haven't done. a.d.AM But what will it do that OSs have not been able to do previously? Combining them givess me more apps I guess, but I've never felt any lack of apps. If you're telling me it'll run apps that Android or Chrome could never run, that would be something! Being able to use apps like Paper, Traktor, and other iOS only apps would be huge. But i have a feeling it'll be another google fail. Combine 2 OSs with no additional benefits. Typical modern innovation. mattcoz Apps (ugh, I still hate that word) are not the issue here. Android and Chrome OS have never been viable alternatives to Windows or OSX or any decent Linux distro. Will Andromeda? Time will tell. Wes C >But the Pixel and Pixel XL, Google Home, Google Wifi, Daydream View, and the new Chromecast Ultra will likely remain the focus on that day Have we forgotten about the smartwatches?? I really need to replace my OG G Watch... http://www.androidpolice.com/2016/07/11/exclusive-these-could-be-googles-upcoming-android-wear-smartwatches/ Chris Yessss I would love a nice replacement for my Gear Live thartist Smartwatches are a fad gone. br_hermon Flood of thoughts running through my head but 1st thoughts... "Android" as a beloved brand and I hope Google sticks with it to brand this going forward. Samsung must be prepping for full court press with Tizen right now and see the "writing on the wall" in terms of Google's current/past Android / OEM relationship structure. Cory Wilson I just hope as far as updates go, it's more chrome OS in those regards m0ritz They should just develop it for the Pixel C... This tablet was planned to run Chrome OS... And it's still the strongest tablet on the market. Stephen Sharp Maybe they will offer the option, who knows Captain_Invisible By then it will be about two years old, so I really doubt that. mattcoz They should just develop it for what would be 2 year old hardware? How does that make any sense? roberto.elena What a downer, I wanted to buy a chromebook (a decent one) later this year or early next year, as soon as the Android apps on Chrome OS became a stable option, but now... too many unknowns for the future of current chromebooks. Stephen Sharp Get a refurbed Chromebook Flip to hold you over roberto.elena Unfortunately the availability of Chromebooks is not so good in my country compared to the US. TigerMike901 Well, given the info, I guess I can't wait to see some kind of demo to see the real benefits of Andromeda. Right now I just can't imagine it could do more for me than ChromeOS with Android apps baked in. I mean honestly, I don't really see much of a difference in merging the two to form Andromeda. Stephen Sharp Well in a few years it will do one thing better than Android Apps on Chromebooks: it will still exist. If this is true, it makes more sense than Android Apps on Chromebooks, and Android on Chromebooks are either the trojan horses to get developers to finally make Android Apps that scale well for a laptop formfactor, or a swan song and a parting gift (or maybe both) Scott Miller Correction: Android apps on Chromebooks did not descend from the ARC project. They ditched that approach in favor of a full Android subsystem. This was actually a critical argument in court with Oracle recently. David Ruddock That's correct. The initial approach (ARC) wasn't utilized, but as you said, a new one then emerged. Sorry if the language there was inartful - I meant more that it descended theoretically, not technically. I was just trying to show that it had no relationship to the Andromeda project, not trying to imply that ARC itself powered Android apps on Chrome OS (this was also asked at I/O, where Google gave a similar answer about ARC being abandoned). Quentin SILVESTRE I think their comment is more about the general idea behind the two approaches. Sure the tech changed a lot, but it was still inspired by the desire to have android apps working on chrome os. Andromeda is a merger of two OSes and is a much bigger project. Meaning : Knowing andromeda was a long way off, they probably figured they should find a way to bring android apps to chrome os as we know it today. Plus it gives time and hardware for developpers to prepare for a version of android that would span acrosse multiple form factors. Rocco Augusto While Google did ditch ARC technology as an extension that could be loaded into Chrome, they still do refer to the Android subsystem/container as ARC in the Chrome OS code base. So technically, you're both right. :) JD I don't know. Based on how Google's past hardware undertakings have been I don't really want to pay premium dollars to be a beta tester. Announcements like this setup Surface level expectations. Looking at the Pixel C that was definitely not Surface level polished product. It was and still is a half finished work in progress, and with Google only promising 24 months of major releases I'm tired of paying to be a beta tester just to be abandoned with a half finished product. If they promised 3-4 years of support I might jump or if the technology allowed for a windows type experience where I could upgrade drivers(I know that's not how it works). At this point Google seems to be going in a paradigm shift, I'm going to sit back and wait till they settle in and head towards to polish phase (Which I don't think they'll ever head in). I'm just a bit tired of the throw everything at the wall and see what sticks approach, they need focus. Patrick Plante If they bake us a full compliant Android device that has a full Chome browser, I'm sold, that would the the exact thing I would want, best of both world. You could add real multi-window management and that would do the trick. Not talking about side by side here, while useful, I would like to get real window management. Stephen Sharp This + full access to Bash (maybe in a developer mode) and I wouldn't need anything else :P Patrick Plante Forgot that, you're right! Stephen Sharp I suppose the same people asking "why" now asked "why" in 2010* when Google first started beta testing Chromebooks, and this makes more sense than ChromeOS did back then. ChromeOS doesn't do anything that Android can't, merely things that Android currently doesn't do David Ruddock This is an excellent way to put it, and I've long thought something similar. Android has huge advantages over Chrome for hardware extensibility, content ecosystem, and developer support. One of those you could maybe, eventually replicate in Chrome OS. But two you could not. PVL_93_RU By content ecosystem - do you mean apps/programs? And is developer support an issue for ChromeOS when they're bringing over millions of Android apps and extensions aren't going away from Chrome? jesuguru Is running Android apps in a subsystem on ChromeOS the same as running natively on Android/Andromeda? PVL_93_RU good point, of course Native will be superior TedPhillips i would strongly disagree about 'hardware extensibility'. crOS's sane approach to hardware is exactly why there is no update lag, OEM churn, premature EOL of devices, or platform software fragmentation. android's approach to hardware is spaghetti meets wall, and first one to drop support after the sale - wins. Patrick Plante Someone knows if the october 4th event is livestreamed? If yes, someone has a link that will stream it and/or the exact time of the event, including UTC. Thanks. TigerMike901 Google usually live streams these things on Youtube....but the link probably won't be up until the 4th. sleepinlight So, there's really no news on what this means for phones? I'll be honest, this is cool and all, but this is probably the least interesting way that this news could have taken shape for me. I was really hoping this would be more about fixing problems with Android on phones (updates/fragmentation, poor way of handling background services, performance issues) than putting Android on a laptop. Duder12 Huh? They already are by ignoring the OEMs and doing their own thing. The pixel line will finally give them the control of the software/hardware they need. pfmiller The Nexus phones already gave them the control of the software they needed. He's talking about for devices that Google doesn't control. Stephen Sharp Why not both? They could be starting in a formfactor that OEMS haven't cared about, so "wrestling control" from them wouldn't be a problem. Google learns how best to do updates, then they come for the Android TVs, then the tablets, then smartwatches, then phones Antics Uh oh. Concern: will "Android" remain alive as available to anyone via AOSP but "Andromeda" is Google's proprietary fork (akin to the Nexus factory images) or new proprietary OS (as the article[s] suggest) and will only be available for Google's devices as to try to compete with Apple's other computing solutions? Meaning, "Andromeda" may never end up on other manufacturer's excellent hardware. Duder12 So the other manufacturers can ruin he operating system and the brand like they do now? No thank you! I dont need Andromeda Touchwiz Samsung laptops. Railwayman Other manufacturers can't 'ruin' anything if Google put certain rules in place. You should compare with Windows Phone 7 - it launched on devices from HTC, LG and Samsung - all of them running a similar OS with some small differences. You could also look at desktop Windows and Linux, which runs on several different computers despite being the same system (Ubuntu is always Ubuntu regardless of brand name of the computer). Andromeda will fail IF Google attempt to make it 'in-house' only but will be successful if they make it available for other OEMs - with strict requirements of allowed modifications (i.e. they can bundle with different apps and services but not touch the system itself). KChristainsen pass Adithya Pc Inb4 Andromeda Police comments Defenestratus I already checked the domain registrar and its been taken :P alexg None needs that grizzlyjon83 I just can't see ChromeOS sticking around for too long after Andromeda. It'll be the Windows RT of the Google world. Duder12 Yep I agree TigerMike901 Whether ChromeOS exists after Andromenda or not, Google has to support it for a few more years to come. ChromeOS saw a big adoption in the education space, and abandoning it would surely leave a sour taste for many after making the large investments. I think it will either be around or be supported for a while, and then Andromeda will fully take over. In Google's End of Life document on Chromebooks, many models are stated to be supported up to 2020, and some recent models through 2021. Stephen Sharp I don't see them abandoning it at all. Quite frankly ChromeOS already does all it needs to do for those who adopted it, and add Android apps to the mix and it does more than enough. It can live on on the backburner for a while merely getting Chrome browser and security updates, and hopefully, eventually, users of ChromeOS will see Andromeda doing everything they need and more, and switch over grizzlyjon83 That's a fair point about the education space. Regardless, it'll probably get phased out eventually, but it will make it more of a slow death. deppman ah, come on. ChromeOS isn't *that* bad :) PVL_93_RU I don't think they need to spend too much resources to support it though. They basically roll the updates out at the same time as Chrome for other platforms, since the software department is entirely on Google's part and the OEMs only provide the hardware (the Chromebooks), so the worst that can happen is it will slowly fade away as Andromeda takes over both mobile and desktop class of Google products Mix My dad told me his favorite animal before he walked out the door and something bad happened to him but I will never forget it, Bison...... I am hoping that the phone and 7" tablet are not $600+ CAD...fingers crossed PVL_93_RU inb4 no LTE capability David Ruddock That doesn't actually seem to be planned at the moment. But it could change. PVL_93_RU Well the Pixel C still doesn't have an LTE version either so... I'm not holding my breath :( Ace AP has pretty much stripped Google off from any surprises in Oct 4th, we know almost everything now...it'll now be like attending the event as deja vu Joris Griffioen Yeah, kinda sad really. Unless they come with some real surprises. Like non-fugly Pixel phones for instance... PVL_93_RU That's what always happens though. Still excited for the event, since we don't EXACTLY know how the whole Andromeda thing is gonna work or look etc wrkerr At first glance of the headline, I read a Pixel 3' laptop, and so I started imagining a laptop with a 36" screen. :) TJStrat Looks like Google is inspired by Microsoft. A PC OS which runs apps. This sounds like Windows 10 to me. Nick Interesting. Developer driven apps. Would be pretty cool to see a suite of android development apps on their new platform, but not sure the market needs to be skewed anymore like the messaging scene. Now if only I didn't have to have a mac to develop for iOS, sigh. Still is exciting though. jon I seen this coming years ago. i hope google releases the os in a iso format. but probably not Marko Šaric Cool, I guess. More expensive shit that I can't afford but would like to. Anyway, all I would be doing on that laptop would be refreshing Android police 8 times a day and watching YouTube. keithzg For that you could probably just hook a monitor and keyboard up to a Raspberry Pi ;) Madis After all this, why was the original article about Andromeda claimed to be wrong then? To discourage leaks? http://www.androidpolice.com/2015/10/29/wsj-google-reportedly-plans-to-merge-chrome-into-android-form-single-new-os-in-2017/ http://www.androidpolice.com/2015/11/02/google-refutes-rumors-of-chrome-os-merging-with-android-says-its-here-to-stay/ person Technically nothing has changed. They've said that Android and Chrome weren't merging but that they'd bring the best of each platform to the other. Design and apps are coming to ChromeOS though whatever will end up in Andromeda is yet to be known. Both still exist and there is no 'merger'. Madis Both still exist and there is no 'merger'. Well, yes, because it's still 2016. They could "bring the best" from/to each other, but if Andromeda is real, I bet at least one of those OSs (Chrome OS) will still be discontinued eventually, ending up with a merge. Maybe if phones get better, they'll discontinue Android too and use Andromeda with wired full computer capabilities (you know, Continuum). person Potential has no bearing on intent or feasibility. Regardless of whether a merger could happen at some point in the indefinite future, as it stands now that is not the case. ChromeOS and Android coexist; there is no merger. Jordan L take my money. bugdroid Ok. Lawrence Q3 2017 ZzzZzzZz Sarath Chandra Gullapalli Is the Andromeda name confirmed for commercial launch? Or will it be Android Desktop a la Android Wear? TigerMike901 Android Desktop running Andromeda? :) Jamie Moore Q3 of 2017? Glad I got my Pixel LS... keithzg And I'm still choked that Google refused to sell me one, although admittedly I rarely use a laptop. 1pixel What a time to be alive Deckard_Cain Why no dedicated GPU??? Stephen Sharp For Android games? They aren't there yet bmlsayshi As a person who loves Android and finds it vastly preferable to the alternatives... I have to ask why? Why kill Chrome OS like that? It's different enough and single purposed enough. I don't wan't Chrome on Android. I don't even care about Android on Chrome. I LOVE Chrome OS but I don't foresee using it on Android. Charlie You don't even know HOW the products/OSD is designed , will be rolled out and/or in what sense it will be replacing Chrome OS. It's still a year away. Just relax, and see where this take us. It might be a smoother transition than you think. keithzg /me switches .com to .ca, sees price go up to $1,257.28 with another $100 in shipping, weeps Amit_N At $799, I can buy a laptop with 256 SSD and i7, that can power any damn linux distro along with Windows. Am I the only one that is not sold with this devices? Jaime I'm in the market for a new laptop, care to give me an example of which laptop can I get with the internals you mentioned? Thanks! Amit_N I have older version of this laptop with i5, I absolutely love this laptop. Total value for money. https://www.amazon.com/dp/B015P3SKHQ Jaime Awesome, thank you! keithzg I have a first-hand Pixel, and it's the construction that has me still holding onto it instead of buying a newer laptop. The screen ratio is actually pretty fantastic and you don't find it anywhere else, and as someone who's allergic to branding (well, as allergic as people are to wifi, which is to say that it's all in my head but I'm rabid about it) the unadorned metal lid is a godsend. I dual-boot mine with ChromeOS and Kubuntu; if Google had ever deigned to sell the second-gen Pixel here in Canada I would've bought that too. warcaster Hopefully they make some $200-$250 ARM variants as well, not 100% Intel as they've been pushing so far with Chromebooks. Even Andromeda notebooks with Zen APUs would be a breath of fresh air. keithzg Huh? There's plenty if ARM Chromebooks. Or do you mean Pixel devices? 'Cause the most recent of those, the Pixel C, was also ARM. MJ My questions are.... Will I be able to install this Andromeda OS on a laptop I already own? Would I be able to install a different OS on this upcoming "Bison" aka Pixel 3 device (easily)? I get the feeling this is just another step down the road to turn desktop PCs into locked down smartphones with a monitor and keyboard/mouse. meijin3 Any news on the Pixel C running Andromeda? PVL_93_RU It'd be very weird if it didn't considering on the base system level it can theoretically at least dualboot Sarath Chandra Gullapalli Could Google unveil "Universal Apps" at the Oct 4th event ?? PVL_93_RU universal apps? person Insinuating that they aren't already? deppman This was so obvious in 2012; Google should have had a Jide-remix-like skunkworks project on this *then*, not in 2015. It's like captain obvious finally walked up to Sergey and slapped him in the face. I'm happy with this direction, and really look forward to the OS. I just wish they'd gotten on it sooner. TedPhillips bleh, I need to go reread the andromeda article.... as someone who's into both ecosystems from a technical angle, putting cros bits into android, instead of android bits into cros still seems like the much worse option... doesn't mean it won't be successful, but i think the world would be a better place with the reverse. keithzg Yeah, ChromeOS's guts are a much saner, much more standard stack. Android suffers from a lot of NIH syndrome under the hood by comparison. I suppose with how Google has been trending towards being more proprietary and locked-down recently it makes sense they'd go that direction, but it's still disappointing. drksilenc I read that as a 3' pixel laptop at first... Brian These sound a lot like Reef and Kevin chromebooks? keithzg So I wonder if it'll be available in Canada like the Pixel C, or weirdly unavailable here like the Chromebook Pixels. Although about a year out is admittedly too soon to be worrying about availability, heh. Luxferro If it doesn't have replaceable storage (m.2 SSD), then I'll never be interested in google's premium laptops. It was the reason I did not buy the previous Pixel laptop. Stephen Sharp I'd like to sign up for the giveaway, please :P Adal With all these exclusive Google article in AP, i have a feeling Sundar Pichai is directly working with AP. is he your primary source of leaks? :) Peterson Silva No, they just have someone hidden under his desk. Shhh, don't tell him :D PVL_93_RU that's because the AP crew are actually Google employees, but shhh, nobody should know this juanjeremy2012 man i just hope it doenst lose the slickness of chromebooks. chromebooks do 90% of what you do better than windows and if they added an off line office suite that number would jump to 97%. juanjeremy2012 i dont want these expensive aluminum ultrathin things. i just want a decent plastic design like what is on hp stream or dell latitude that doesnt flex for about $500 JohnCalla $800 for a 12" Android laptop. Not seeing much of a market for this. Jonathan Ramos Wait why 2017? Seems like a great time to release. I doubt anyone is rushing out and getting Pixel tablets running Android this Christmas. LewisSD Just sayin, I totally wrote a thread about this merger of Android and Chrome 4 years ago on androidandme. I'm stoked to see Google make it happen! Chris Johnston so the question is... will this gain market share and actually be viable? or will this be steam OS part 2? I know, different applications and all, but they are both built off of linux. Chris Skipper 9 reasons why Andromeda HAS to be a Chrome OS mode inside Android: 1. Google has said Chrome OS is here to stay and not only said that Chrome OS would continue to exist, a spokesperosn also confirmed to The Verge that BOTH Android and Chrome OS will continue to exist, which means they will continue to be offered as separate products. 2. Hiroshi Lockehimer, SVP of Andorid, Chrome OS, and Google Play has told JR Raphel that he made no sense of the rumors that first came out 3. Even though Hiroshi Lockheimer said he couldn't make sense of the rumor, the original Wall Street Journal report even though mentioned that Android remained as the dominant system, they said that Google would continue to maintain Chrome OS but the focus would be using Chrome OS to expand Android onto PCs. 4. Eric Schmidt in TechCrunch has said that you don't get rid of one or the other, but that technlogy moves forward when one can be wrapped into the other and mentioned how the environments can come together, but mentioned that the OS system attributes should be separate. 5. To make the two operating systems into one operating system, you would need to save both the advantages of using Chrome OS and the advantages of using Android. You can decide to merge Android into Chrome OS but that would require virtualization or dual booting. Then if you decide to do Andromeda without continuing to offer Chrome OS, you lose the advantages of Chrome OS. 6. Google wouldn't be building Fuchsia if they knew they could just merge Android and Chrome OS which means there would be no intention on writing a new OS and like Hiroshi said, if they thought about both of these on day one the foundation would've been built to have the best of both but Android and Chrome OS 7. There will not a "desktop version of Android" because the material design showcase does not show a desktop version of Android. It shows Chrome OS. That freeform mode is hidden deliberately because it's only there to create APIs so that way Android apps on Chrome isn't like the beta where there are fixed sizes and you can't resize your Android apps. 8. An AndroidCentral journalist claims that the Pixel C was made to run Android but with a desktop version of Chrome with ARM APIs even though the Pixel C was planned with Project Athena, Frankenboard, and then they decided to just flash Android. 9. AndroidPolice says Andromeda is Android and that Chrome OS will still be something else and now you see BOTH TABLETS AND PCs being tested with this new OS while Chrome OS has never been on anything else but a PC. What Google would have to do to build Andromeda as a mode within Android: 1. Take the Chrome browser from the Chrome OS client and make it an app inside Android. 2. Create a Quick Setting inside Android that opens this app when pressed. 3. Now you have a Windows 8 esquesqe functionality for Android (except that one environment wouldn't be used as a launcher for the other). 4. The utility used to tap into the container for Chrome OS would be used so that way it would tap into the same libs used in the Android System so that way Android Apps can function in the Chrome browser inside the Android System. 5. The utility also packages Android APKs into Chrome Packaged Apps but instead the utility would be tweaked to use redirects in place where the Android APK files would go, like your APK, saves, and states, with the redirects pointing towards the system/app or system/priv-app folders inside the root. The browser would also use the utility to write and delete in that same folder. 6. Finally, when you go into the browser the browser will start a clean new instance and then read the Android apps currently open on recent apps and then do a new instruction that does a call to launch the corresponding CRXs on the browser and then execute the states that are persistently saved as you use Android apps. When you leave the Webtop Mode via an option in the Chrome OS status area, the browser will make the same call to the Android System by having your apps cleared and then opening up the same apps that were opened on the browser and then also executing the states that are being persistently saved as you use your Android apps on Chrome OS. The final result is to create a hybrid operating system where you can use Android as a tablet like you always have been doing but now you'll be able to connect a mouse to your tablet and then be able to switch your UI between Android System UI and Chrome Ash Window Manager with zero interruptions. You would also be able to use your phone as a desktop by connecting it to a display using this same mode. MuleForRent Prevent owners from upgrading the SSD and you'll still sell a lot. Let us add serious storage and Microsoft/Apple will be in for a terrible shock MuleForRent One of the great possible outcomes here is an office suite application 'reset' that strips the crazy complexity and bulk out of native apps. I'd switch from Windows just to get nicely designed, simpler versions of Outlook and Word. Google Docs is great for lots of stuff, but native apps still have their place, and Gmail in all forms is still unpleasant to look at and use. TONY ALDO Q3 2017? ugh talk about cock tease. captainhurt chrome os is NOT about PROVIDING features or apps, but rather about BEING, as an os is defined, a platform to deliver features and apps. Chrome is ALL ABOUT being a platform that is an inherently secure, inherently up-to-date, inherently backed-up, simple, low-cost, lightweight, very fast, cloud-based easy-to-use thin-client. TheSpaceUnicorn The only thing that would make me interested in an Andromeda laptop is full Adobe CC being on it. That's my one requirement for any laptop. Quentin Menini Will Andromeda be called "pixel OS" ? mudi1 its hard incredibly hard to play and win in Microsoft's field, many tried but all lost. if google planning to give a worthy alternative of MS windows then its nothing less then going against titans . i go point wise - 1. AAA gaming is the shied of windows OS and if google wants to succeed they must target AAA gamer requirements. 2. google must start making deals with game devs to code their games on Vulkan API coz 95% AAA games code on DirectX which is MS proprietary . if they code on vulkan then they can be easily playable on google notebook. 3. GPU licensing can play a major role for ex just give amd 20-30$/chip as license and get their big gpu tech like 1024 core Polaris gpu, then couple that with ARM cpu cores ... this will allow google to cut cost like magic bcoz 8 core A73 core cpu built on 10nm node will require just 16 mm2 of die space so cost of soc will be much lower then intel offering hence google will have a price advantage and i choosed AMD polaris coz all console games developed on amd GCN arch. 4. give more support to ARM arch as there is more competition like qualcomm, mediatek, Kirin, imagination and more competition means much faster pace of performance/dollar. 5. fully flagged performance notebook should start with price tag of 400 dollar so that wide adoption will face no trouble . 6. last but most imp - add dedicated external gpu feature on notebooks yes i said external gpu , same way as razor core link - http://www.razerzone.com/store/razer-core thats much needed feature and if google does that then it will sell like hot cakes. just do this and whole gaming community will make a shift to gogole. Hadrian Węgrzynowski > Android apps on Chrome OS descended from the ARC project, while Andromeda is a much larger, more ambitious initiative that is being pursued via merging Chrome features into Android, not vice versa. First part of this sentence is wrong. ChromeOS had experimental ARC (App Runtime for Chrome), but it went nowhere near to support all of Android apps. They abandoned this approach and went with separate Android container beside ChromeOS. You even written about it [1], it is mentioned in Wikipedia [2]. [1] http://www.androidpolice.com/2016/09/22/chrome-android-apps-show-stable-chrome-os-first-time/ [2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrome_OS#Android_applications - second paragraph person A descendant as in they are both part of the same initiative--bringing Android apps to ChromeOS. Andromeda is not. indiandragon Lol, 'merging Chrome features into Android' Isn't that why chrome is there in Playstore already ? If at all something, this should be Android x86 running chrome as front end. Assuming that this is capable of running Android apps natively by design, I'm not sure how google plans of keeping Chrome OS project alive. Pixel Spot If Google uses the "Pixel 3" name for the laptops, what will they do then for the "Pixel 3" phones? Drew Ciccotelli What do you suppose Fuchsia is gonna run on? Andy Chow Not sure I'm happy about this. ChromeOS has been the perfect OS on a laptop so far. Those that say "for the same price I can get a MacBook pro" just don't get it, and probably never will. I didn't get the Pixel C because it wasn't ChromeOS. dontpanicbobby For as minute there I thought they were selling a 3 foot laptop. I had to re-read the title.

We expect all of Google's service to have millions of users, and in some cases billions. But Google's latest news isn't about user numbers, it's about files numbers. According to Prabhakar Raghavan, the vice-president responsible for G Suite in Google Cloud, Google Drive now hosts over two trillion files. Raghavan was speaking to Business Insider at the Google Cloud Next event in London when he revealed the two trillion file count. It's a total of all types of file, including documents, images, and videos. Apparently Google Drive's headquarters includes a large display that outputs a running total of the files and active users, so they always know where it's at. Related Google Reduces JPEG Image File Sizes by 35 Percent Google Reduces JPEG Image File Sizes by 35 Percent Google Drive isn't one of Google's services to reach one billion "active" users, though. The last active user total was confirmed back in January 2016 when it reached 800 million. The actual total number of Drive accounts totals several billion. 17 months on from that count and the one billion mark must be looming near. Raghavan says Google will definitely be telling everyone when it happens. Recent changes to the way in which Gmail handles file attachments will certainly help with the active user count. The received file size limit for Gmail doubled in size to 50MB in March. However, the send limit remained at 25MB. Any file above that size automatically gets added to Google Drive and sent as a link when you attach it to an email. With the increase in the received file size limit, forwarding of emails with larger attachments should have a positive impact on the active user total as well as continuing to increase the overall files stored total.

News Analysis: Italy's tax settlement with Google could set stage for more probes FAMAGUSTA GAZETTE CYPRUS� U.S.-based Internet search giant Google and Italy's tax authority agreed this week to terms to end a long-standing tax dispute over 306 million euros (336 million U.S. dollars), in a deal that experts said would help set the stage for similar agreements in the future. The settlement satisfies Google's tax obligations over a 14-year tax period from 2002 to 2015, at an amount far lower than the 800 million to one billion euros Italy reportedly sought when the investigation was opened last year. But it is also a third higher than the 224-million-euro settlement figure that was leaked to Italian media in the final days of the negotiations. According to Raffaele Barberio, director of the tech-savvy Key4Biz web site, the agreement was a victory in Italy's efforts to ensure big technology companies like Google paid their share of taxes. "There has been an adversarial situation between the Italian state and big digital companies," Barberio told Xinhua. "This doesn't mean that the situation doesn't exist any more, but the wall has been breached. From the point of view of Italian tax collectors, it is a big step forward." Barberio said he would be "surprised" if more investigations into online companies did not follow. Francesco Brandi, a former government tax agency official working as a law professor with Rome's La Sapienza University, agreed. "The biggest development here is not the extra cash for the Italian treasury, but the fact that Google and other major players will have to follow these rules from this point forward," Brandi said in an interview. In a statement, Google, which is a subsidiary of the U.S. holding company Alphabet, Inc., said: "In addition to the corporation tax already paid in Italy, Google will pay an additional 306 million euros." While the case was being negotiated, Google denied owing additional taxes in Italy on several occasions. The central part of the case revolves around allegations that Google illegally lowered its tax obligations by logging profits in low-tax jurisdictions like Ireland. The value of the deal with Google is just short of the 318-million-euro settlement Italy reached with Apple, Inc. in December 2015, still the largest single tax settlement case ever in Italy. More recently, Italy opened an investigation in April into the tax obligations of U.S.-based online retailer Amazon, accusing the company of underpaying its tax bill by at least 130 million euros. Amazon has denied any wrongdoing. (1 euro = 1.10 U.S. dollars) � (Xinhua) Sitemap { powered by bulletlink.com }

Anytime. Anywhere. Build Apps 5x Faster For Half the Cost Enterprise Cloud Computing On Force.com How Burger King Revealed the Hackability of Voice Assistants By Mae Anderson PUBLISHED: MAY 08 2017 Burger King pulled a pretty juicy marketing stunt last month that drew plenty of attention -- not just to the Whopper, but also to the intrinsic vulnerabilities of a new type of voice-activated gadget. The fast food chain's 15-second television ad targeted Google Home, a speaker that can answer questions and control other smart appliances. When an actor in the ad said "OK, Google" and asked a question about the Whopper, Google Home obediently began reading the burger's ingredients in homes around the country -- effectively extending the commercial for however long it took someone to shout "OK, Google, stop!" Google and Wikipedia quickly made fixes to shut it down. Though annoying, the stunt may have done some good by highlighting how easy it is to hijack such devices. (Just imagine a burglar spying a voice assistant and asking it to unlock all the doors.) It could also speed the development of home voice assistants with better security. "It's a wakeup call," said Earl Perkins, a digital security analyst at the research firm Gartner. "It's a harbinger of things to come." Trigger Warning Voice assistants such as Google Home, Apple's Siri and Amazon's Echo devices have always been susceptible to accidental hijack. A Google ad during the Super Bowl that used the phrase "OK, Google" reportedly set off people's devices. And in a January story that briefly turned a family into media celebrities, a woman's 6-year old daughter ordered a dollhouse and sugar cookies simply by asking Amazon's voice assistant Alexa for them. Since the devices are so new -- the Amazon Echo debuted in 2015, Google Home last year -- they're still having growing pains. And they're growing in popularity; Consumer Intelligence Research Partners estimates that Amazon sold 3 million Echo devices in the U.S. in the fourth quarter of 2016, bringing the total to more than 8 million. Amazon doesn't release sales figures. Many experts believe that deliberate attempts to trigger voice assistants will be short-lived. Among other things, brands have to face the consequences of potentially annoying millions of people. "Burger King was doing what the Burger King brand is known to do, stir controversy and make sure it gets lots of coverage," Forrester principal analyst James McQuivey said. "Very few brands want to do that." Of course, spammers and other bottom-feeding marketers can still try to implement the technique. But voice assistants already have a few ways to block them. Threats and Countermeasures Amazon already makes sure its TV commercials and those of its partners can't inadvertently trigger the speaker. Developers that provide Echo with "skills" that let it, for instance, order pizza, are also prohibited from creating Alexa commands that would trigger ads. Google says it also has techniques to block TV ads from activating Google Home. Neither company provided details on those techniques. Voice assistants are still in their "very early days," Google says; the company plans to "monitor and learn as we go." Hackers might also be a threat. But because voice assistants are so new and limited in scope, more established connected devices such as webcams, routers and printers pose more of a threat for now. "It's not that we won't see some creative or unique instance (of hacking), but I don't think this is going to be the next great wave of cybercrime," said Steve Grobman, chief technology officer at the security company McAfee. More Security To Come But before long, the devices are going to need better security. "When you move into a world of voice, some of the rules that we're accustomed to, related to security for computers, change," Gartner's Perkins said. Exactly how that works could depend on exactly what task a voice assistant is performing. Asking about the weather requires less security than say, shopping or accessing a bank account. Amazon already has options for setting up security codes to shop, make financial transactions or unlock and start cars. Of course, someone could always overhear you reciting a security phrase. A better solution, and one that companies are hard at work on, would be to identify a person's voice, much the way Google and Facebook identify faces today. Beyond improving security, that technology could help the device personalize recommendations or even ads for the individual, not the whole family. Apple already lets users voice-train its Siri digital assistant so it's more likely to activate only when it hears a specific voice. Amazon has a voice training option for Alexa. Google Home can recognize up to six different voices, though it won't prevent unauthorized users from activating the assistant. Experts suggest that companies will eventually add cameras to voice assistants. Amazon's new Echo Look has a camera, but it's for offering fashion advice. Combining a facial scan with voice recognition would definitely beef up security, although they'll also create new privacy concerns. "Without any security or minimal security, (voice assistants are) going to be a fat target," Perkins said. "There will be all kinds of innovation associated with compromising these systems." © 2017 Associated Press under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media. All rights reserved.

Nextdoor Broke the Social Network Mold By Paul Lewis PUBLISHED: MAY 07 2017 Nextdoor, the social network that helps neighbors talk to each other, has a billion-dollar valuation and a presence in streets from San Jose to Liverpool. But according to its CEO, none of the tech giants are interested in acquiring it. "Facebook, Google, those guys haven't actually come and talked to us," said Nirav Tolia. "It's maybe hard, when you're the big Goliath, to take some of these little mice seriously," he added. "And we're OK being a mouse... Because the mouse is getting stronger every day." Tolia, 45, is a fast-talking businessman with a string of startups and a penchant for hubristic mouse metaphors. He is the archetype of a California tech entrepreneur. Nextdoor, in contrast, breaks the Silicon Valley mold. The company -- an unapologetically utilitarian place to share recommendations about dentists, find out where to dump a used sofa or receive alerts about local police activity -- has been expanding across the US over the past seven years. It has been a very different path to the shooting-star trajectory of viral, app-based startups. "We're not Snapchat, we're not Instagram," Tolia said. "We don't have 50 million users in six months." One reason for the delayed growth has been Nextdoor's reliance on a kind of crowd-sourced approach to defining neighborhoods, in which communities themselves draw the borders to their communities and name them. But that "slow and steady" approach is starting to pay off, Tolia said, adding that the company now has "tens of millions" of users. (A company spokesperson later said the figure is usually described as "millions.") Still, the growth has been impressive. Five years ago, Nextdoor had just 7,000 neighborhood groups. Today it claims to have more than 137,000 -- which it says amounts to roughly 70% of America's neighborhoods. And now the company is making forays into Europe, via recent launches in the Netherlands and the UK. That incremental approach to expansion is unusual for social media companies. So, too, is Nextdoor's professed commitment to ensuring a cordial online community. It has been called "the anti-Facebook," but in ethos, at least, it might be better described as the version of Facebook that Mark Zuckerberg wishes he had created. No Ranting Nextdoor threads and posts are by no means immune to controversy, but there is nothing like the febrile, combative tone that has contaminated other social media -- in part because members are required to use real names and addresses. But the startup does more than just verify identities; it rigorously enforces a culture of civility with rules that prohibit, for example, debate about "non-local issues that are known to be highly controversial," even going so far as explicitly discouraging conversations about presidential politics. Guidelines warn users they cannot "berate," "belittle," "troll," or "swear" and urges them to report any neighbors guilty of "over-posting, campaigning, repeatedly posting, or ranting about controversial, non-local issues. (A rant is defined as: "ALL CAPS, excessive punctuation, provocative language, judgmental accusations, or repetitive explanations.") It is hard to imagine how Facebook, Reddit or Twitter would survive 24 hours under such strict rules. Tolia concedes these regulations run "completely counter" to Silicon Valley's prevailing free speech culture. But he believes they're essential. "We have from the very beginning felt that community, and avoiding things that are divisive, are at the very core and foundation of what we've done," he said. "It's not something that we've had to bolt-on after some crisis." That's not entirely true. In late 2015, Nextdoor became known as a forum in which neighbors were using the popular "crime and safety" forums to flag racially biased reports of suspicious activity in their community. The company, to its credit, amended its technology to block users from reporting suspicious activity on the basis of race alone. Tolia said the episode only galvanized the firm's mission to stamp out conflict between people. "Nextdoor's view is that you can disagree... without being disagreeable," he said. The key to monetizing Nextdoor is their cache of verified personal data. Tolia claims the company is on the cusp of offering a level of targeting that is even more granular and reliable than that of Google and Facebook, who dominate the $60bn industry in digital ads. Nextdoor's data could be especially useful to the burgeoning and controversial market in political advertising, in which companies are overlaying detailed data about voters to target the most persuasive ads. But political ads will only work on Nextdoor if its users are discussing politics. That may explain why Nextdoor, in a move that seemed to be contrary to its aversion to conflict, recently started hosting local forums about hot political topics. "We want to create a kind of area in the service where those conversations can happen, and people can passionately argue one way or another," Tolia said. He played down a report in Politico that the move was intended as an entry into the lucrative market of political influencing. But he conceded he was approached by a company that "could take your address and put it through a voter database and see everyone you've voted for and then show you an ad that was personalized to your beliefs." He added: "We felt that was not something that would sort of build our credibility as a company." Asked if he could guarantee that Nextdoor would not micro-target political ads, Tolia got a few words in before his PR executive, who was also present, interrupted. "Don't!" she said. "Don't guarantee all this." He was reluctant to be drawn further. "This is such a theoretical conversation," he said. "Because, we literally have never had any of these conversations." But what about the example he just gave about the advertiser who wanted to target voters through Nextdoor? "Five years ago," he replied. "We had one conversation." Then Steve Wymer, a former Republican operative recently hired as a vice-president at Nextdoor, who was also sitting in on the interview, intervened. He reminded his boss they "were in New York a couple of weeks ago and we talked to a political targeting ad group." Tolia nodded but added a clarification. "We just said we're not interested," he said. "And we haven't followed up." © 2017 Guardian Web under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media. All rights reserved. Image credit: Nextdoor.

Since January, we’ve run a pilot program with more than 50 organizations who have hosted 100+ events to ensure that the space and resources are flexible and beneficial to the needs of local organizations. As part of today’s opening, we’re also sharing that in 2016 alone, Google.org supported Bay Area nonprofits with $50M in direct grant funding, and Googlers have volunteered over 89,000 hours of their time to local organizations. This post comes from Shaun Tai, the Executive Director at Oakland Digital and Product Lead at BRIDGEGOOD.com. He talks about his experience hosting weekly programs in the Community Space and the many ways he and his team are supported by Google.org and Googler volunteers. BRIDGEGOOD program students meet with Google.org volunteers at Google’s Community Space Every Wednesday this year, Oakland Digital has brought a group of community college students to Google’s 188 The Embarcadero office so they can collaborate, learn, and work on community-benefit projects. These students are part of BRIDGEGOOD—an online hiring platform that connects under-resourced creatives (e.g., graphic designers and artists) with real-world design and marketing projects generated by businesses and nonprofits throughout the community. Oakland Digital has proudly participated in a pilot program that Google.org has been running for 50 local organizations to provide feedback for their new Community Space. Nonprofit organizations know that finding affordable space in the Bay Area is a constant and growing issue. Working in close collaboration with local organizations, Google’s 8,400+ square feet of event and meeting space is an absolute game changer. It’s flexible enough for nonprofits to host collaborative brainstorming sessions to larger capacity, full-day seminars. Since the pilot started, there have been more than 100 events in the space, and in true Google fashion, their teams have “launched and iterated” by taking feedback and implementing changes into the space so it could better suit our needs. Other perks: the space comes fully-stocked with a microkitchen, a conference room, an area to hold workshops, a maker’s space, Chromebooks, VR equipment and more. Google’s support of Oakland Digital started in 2012 when Googlers Mary and Steve Grove educated small businesses at Oakland City Hall about the power of technology. Each year, our relationship and community impact has grown—from board membership, thought leadership, and in 2015, funding. Google shares Oakland Digital’s belief that creativity can change the world— and recognized that an overlooked pipeline of creative talent comes from community colleges.  As such, Google.org provided significant support—a multi-year, six-figure grant for us to build, design, create, and deploy our BRIDGEGOOD web application. Oakland Digital is most proud that local students are a part of design and engineering process—having access to Google’s community space has inspired and boosted the confidence of our beneficiaries. The equipment, the technology, and the space itself has allowed us to work more productively together. The energy that exists at Google.org, combined with access to this new Community Space and its nonprofit-driven programs, is fueling positive change and will make a difference. It’s that same combination of energy and access that will help other local Bay Area social entrepreneurs further their scale and impact. So to my fellow Bay Area nonprofits and social good innovators, I invite you to come check out Google’s Community Space and apply for membership to start the process to host your events and programs in the space today at g.co/communityspace. Membership for the space is free—just click on “Become a Member” at the top right. The website also includes details on what is included in the space and programs that Google.org will coordinate throughout the year. Stay inspired, continue to spread inspiration, and remember that with creativity and leadership, anything is possible.

But how can businesses with multiple locations make sure they aren’t penalized in search rankings? Produced in association with SweetIQ. Google My Business Google My Business was rolled out in 2014 to make it easier for local businesses to be found via search. It had an added benefit of allowing businesses to stay on top of reviews, and to perform analytics on interactions like clicks, views, calls and requests for directions. In other words, it became the first step in any local search marketing strategy. Today, a well-maintained GMB listing remains a vital source of traffic and, ultimately, revenue – especially for businesses competing for location-specific keywords. Google’s ‘three pack’ of local search results, which is triggered by search terms with local intent like “restaurants Venice Beach”, is given significantly more prominence than organic results in both desktop and mobile SERPs. In fact, organic results are not even visible above the fold for mobile users. Google’s mobile SERP for ‘restaurants Venice beach’ (left) vs ‘Venice beach’ (right). Screenshots courtesy of Andy Favell Essential for SEO Since Google reduced the number of local results from 7 to 3 in 2015, it has become more important than ever for businesses to feature as high as possible in these results. And with 1 in 3 Google searches now having local intent (according to digital marketing expert Jordan Kasteler) there is more traffic up for grabs than ever. On the flip-side, competition for this traffic is fierce, meaning mistakes can cost you dearly. The Local Search Association estimates that over $10bn worth of potential annual sales are lost because of missing or conflicting information in Google My Business listings. For businesses with multiple locations, this is a real problem; each business location has a unique address and contact details. How can big businesses ensure they aren’t penalized for conflicting information on their Google My Business profile? First steps Luckily, Google is well aware of this problem, and allows business owners to claim multi-location business listings. However, in order to be verified by Google as such, a few conditions must first be met. A business must: Have at least 10 locations Not be a service business Not be an agency managing several clients The local 3-pack for ‘pizza delivery New York’ returns Domino’s Pizza – a chain with many hundred locations Share this article Facebook0 Linkedin40 Google+14 Twitter 54 Related articles Should Google be more transparent with its updates? 8 technical issues holding your content back How to identify and fix indexation bloat issues Top tips on voice search: Artificial Intelligence, location and SEO Optimize your multi-location business After claiming your multi-location business on GMB, the next step is to optimize your listing. But before you can do this, you must first understand what factors influence your chance of appearing in the local ‘three pack’. The most important of these is accuracy across all platforms. This means making sure every piece of information about your business is consistent across all the websites it appears on, including Yellow Pages, Yelp, Facebook, Foursquare, Apple Maps, Hotfrog and, of course, your own website. Google bots crawl all of these pages and, when encountering information about your business, will compare it to your GMB listing to establish its validity. Any inconsistencies will raise a red flag about the accuracy of your information and will likely lead to your GMB listing being penalized in the rankings. How do you ensure accuracy between your listings? 1. Claim and verify all your locations using a single, unique GMB account. Make sure you delete any duplicate listings or accounts that may have been created by other staff members in other locations. 2. Ensure your business name, address and phone number (‘NAP’) are an exact match wherever they appear. The easiest way to achieve this is to simply copy and paste from your GMB listing. 3. Optimize your store locator on your central website so it’s crawlable by Google. Google considers your website the most ‘official’ source of information regarding your company, so ensuring Google can access it is essential. 4. Use a microsite for each of your store locations. This gives each location a unique reference and separate About page – each with an accurate NAP that Google can crawl. 5. Use a Local Marketing Platform to manage all of this information. It allows you to see what Google sees, and check and edit data for all your store location from a single interface – ensuring complete accuracy across all platform. Most can also provide advice on optimizing store locators for your website, along with detailed analytics on user interactions, traffic sources and more.   To learn more about optimizing GMB listings for multi-location businesses, and to understand how to turn GMB data into actionable insights, download the SweetIQ Guide to Google My Business.

The fast food chain's 15-second television ad targeted Google Home, a speaker that can answer questions and control other smart appliances. When an actor in the ad said "OK, Google" and asked a question about the Whopper, Google Home obediently began reading the burger's ingredients in homes around the country - effectively extending the commercial for however long it took someone to shout "OK, Google, stop!" Google and Wikipedia quickly made fixes to shut it down. Though annoying, the stunt may have done some good by highlighting how easy it is to hijack such devices. (Just imagine a burglar spying a voice assistant and asking it to unlock all the doors.) It could also speed the development of home voice assistants with better security. "It's a wakeup call," said Earl Perkins, a digital security analyst at the research firm Gartner. "It's a harbinger of things to come." Trigger Warning Voice assistants such as Google Home, Apple's Siri and Amazon's Echo devices have always been susceptible to accidental hijack. A Google ad during the Super Bowl that used the phrase "OK, Google" reportedly set off people's devices. And in a January story that briefly turned a family into media celebrities, a woman's 6-year old daughter ordered a dollhouse and sugar cookies simply by asking Amazon's voice assistant Alexa for them. Since the devices are so new - the Amazon Echo debuted in 2015, Google Home last year - they're still having growing pains. And they're growing in popularity; Consumer Intelligence Research Partners estimates that Amazon sold 3 million Echo devices in the U.S. in the fourth quarter of 2016, bringing the total to more than 8 million. Amazon doesn't release sales figures. Many experts believe that deliberate attempts to trigger voice assistants will be short-lived. Among other things, brands have to face the consequences of potentially annoying millions of people. "Burger King was doing what the Burger King brand is known to do, stir controversy and make sure it gets lots of coverage," Forrester principal analyst James McQuivey said. "Very few brands want to do that." Of course, spammers and other bottom-feeding marketers can still try to implement the technique. But voice assistants already have a few ways to block them. Threats and Countermeasures Amazon already makes sure its TV commercials and those of its partners can't inadvertently trigger the speaker. Developers that provide Echo with "skills" that let it, for instance, order pizza, are also prohibited from creating Alexa commands that would trigger ads. Google says it also has techniques to block TV ads from activating Google Home. Neither company provided details on those techniques. Voice assistants are still in their "very early days," Google says; the company plans to "monitor and learn as we go." Hackers might also be a threat. But because voice assistants are so new and limited in scope, more established connected devices such as webcams, routers and printers pose more of a threat for now. "It's not that we won't see some creative or unique instance (of hacking), but I don't think this is going to be the next great wave of cybercrime," said Steve Grobman, chief technology officer at the security company McAfee. More Security to Come But before long, the devices are going to need better security. "When you move into a world of voice, some of the rules that we're accustomed to, related to security for computers, change," Gartner's Perkins said. Exactly how that works could depend on exactly what task a voice assistant is performing. Asking about the weather requires less security than say, shopping or accessing a bank account. Amazon already has options for setting up security codes to shop, make financial transactions or unlock and start cars. Of course, someone could always overhear you reciting a security phrase. A better solution, and one that companies are hard at work on, would be to identify a person's voice, much the way Google and Facebook identify faces today. Beyond improving security, that technology could help the device personalize recommendations or even ads for the individual, not the whole family. Apple already lets users voice-train its Siri digital assistant so it's more likely to activate only when it hears a specific voice. Amazon has a voice training option for Alexa. Google Home can recognize up to six different voices, though it won't prevent unauthorized users from activating the assistant. Experts suggest that companies will eventually add cameras to voice assistants. Amazon's new Echo Look has a camera, but it's for offering fashion advice. Combining a facial scan with voice recognition would definitely beef up security, although they'll also create new privacy concerns. "Without any security or minimal security, (voice assistants are) going to be a fat target," Perkins said. "There will be all kinds of innovation associated with compromising these systems."

 YOUR E-MAIL VERIFICATION CODE Pakistan and Afghanistan plan to use Google Maps to help settle a border dispute that led to deadly clashes last week, officials from both sides said Monday. At least eight civilians were killed on both sides in fighting that began when a Pakistani census team accompanied by soldiers visited disputed villages along the southern border on Friday. Pakistan inherited its 2,400-kilometre (1,500-mile) border with its western neighbour when it gained independence from Britain in 1947, but Afghanistan has never formally recognised it. And while official Afghan maps reflect the so-called "Durand Line", many nationalists believe the true border of their country ends at the River Indus that runs though Pakistan and gave India its name. "Officials from the geological survey departments of the two countries will conduct a survey, and they will also make use of Google Maps," said a senior Pakistani security source in Islamabad who requested anonymity. Abdul Razeq, the police chief of Afghanistan's Kandahar province, added: "After negotiations, both sides have agreed that a geological survey should be conducted. "Technical teams of both countries will use GPS and Google Maps as well as other means to get the answer." Internet firm Google complies with local laws in certain countries that compel it to show borders in line with national demands. For instance, its Indian site shows the entirety of disputed Kashmir as controlled by India. In Pakistan, however, the site shows the internationally recognised de facto border, the Line of Control, marked with a dotted line to denote it is disputed. In 2010 Google was embroiled in a Central American border dispute that saw two neighbouring countries dispatch troops and heavily armed police to their joint border. The incident happened after a Nicaraguan commander cited Google's version of the border map in an interview with Costa Rican newspaper La Nacion to justify a raid on a disputed area of Costa Rica. Google later said it had made a mistake and corrected its map to reflect one sanctioned by the US State Department. Pakistan last year began trying to harden the traditionally soft border with Afghanistan through trenching and fencing, but its efforts were met with hostility from Kabul. Ethnic Pashtuns living in the region have traditionally paid it little heed. Villages straddling the frontier have mosques and houses with one door in Pakistan and another in Afghanistan. Kashif Nabi, a local administrator in Pakistan's Baluchistan province said the surveyor teams, which included military officers, arrived in the border villages on Monday and were working "amicably." He said the situation is calm but that the border crossing in the area remains closed. Sartaj Aziz, the foreign affairs adviser to Pakistani prime minister, told reporters neither side wants "any violence between our two countries or any loss of life." He said diplomacy must overcome the "misunderstandings and restore trust," though he reiterated Islamabad claims that Afghanistan fired first. Aziz said the two sides also agreed to look at the demarcation line in the area. "I hope in the next couple of days the issue will be resolved through meetings between local commanders as well as at the high level commanders," he added.

"It's great to have Google in this region," conservationist Emily Cedzo said. "So by no means are we going after Google ... Our concern, primarily, is the source of that water." Bruce Smith/AP When three sacred staples of the South weren't safe from the cloudy, salty water in his town, Clay Duffie knew there was a problem. "It'd kill your azaleas if you irrigated with it; your grits would come out in a big clump, instead of creamy like they should," Duffie said. Even the sweet tea. "Your tea would come out all cloudy," Duffie said. "Oh man, it was bad news." Duffie, the general manager of Mount Pleasant Waterworks, said before his agency outside Charleston began purifying the water in the early 1990s, the water was also soft; you'd come out of the shower and still feel dirty, he recalled. Today, Duffie has a new concern — a request by Google for permission from South Carolina regulators to pump more groundwater than they're already entitled to for their data center in nearby Berkeley County. "We've invested a lot in making sure the groundwater quality that we treat and send to the customers is of high quality. We also want to protect the quantity side of that," Duffie said. In addition to building several reverse osmosis plants to treat the water, Duffie said the community has spent about $50 million since the mid-1990s to install pipelines and purchase surface water from the Charleston Water System to supplement the water being pumped from underground. Google currently has the right to pump up to half a million gallons a day at no charge. Now the company is asking to triple that, to 1.5 million. That's close to half of the groundwater that Mount Pleasant Waterworks pumps daily from the same underground aquifer to help supply drinking water to more than 80,000 residents of the area. Enlarge this image Clay Duffie of Mount Pleasant Waterworks says in some ways he's pleased the debate over Google's data center is heightening local awareness about the long-term sustainability of the water supply. "It's raised the issue that these resources are not limitless," he said. Sarah McCammon/NPR hide caption toggle caption Sarah McCammon/NPR Clay Duffie of Mount Pleasant Waterworks says in some ways he's pleased the debate over Google's data center is heightening local awareness about the long-term sustainability of the water supply. "It's raised the issue that these resources are not limitless," he said. Sarah McCammon/NPR Google spokesman Patrick Lenihan said the company needs the water to cool its servers. "It takes a lot of energy to run a data center, so we use water to cool them down," he said. Lenihan said Google has brought about 400 jobs to the region, and said the company is taking steps to conserve water and energy while also preparing for the needs of the future. "The internet is constantly expanding and data centers allow the internet to continue to do that. We're very long-term thinkers in terms of capacity, so we're always preparing for more growth," Lenihan said. Google wouldn't allow NPR to see the inside of its South Carolina data center, which opened up nearly a decade ago in Berkeley County. But it's in a suburban area surrounded by woods and office buildings, and protected by a guard shack and fence. The only real clues to what's happening inside are a couple of Google logos on signs outside the gate. Emily Cedzo of the Coastal Conservation League is worried about its impact on the underground aquifer that the community relies on: "It's great to have Google in this region; folks are proud to say that Google calls Charleston home," Cedzo said. "So by no means are we going after Google ... Our concern, primarily, is the source of that water." Cedzo notes that in another dry, Southern state, Google is using recycled wastewater at its data center in Douglas County, Ga. "Google foot the bill for that," Cedzo said. "So if they're doing it there, why can't they do it here?" Lenihan, the Google spokesman, said the company makes such decisions based on the needs and characteristics of each site. He said Google's consultants settled on groundwater as the preferred option in South Carolina. "We're a data company; we care a lot about data and making decisions based off of that, so we did a lot of homework," he said. With its six data centers nationwide, Google is just one of several major tech companies operating centers in relatively dry parts of the country, like eBay in Salt Lake City and Microsoft in San Antonio. A 2016 report by the U.S. Department of Energy noted that as the industry expands, the data center sector is using an increasing amount of water for cooling and electricity generation. In that report and elsewhere, the federal government is also looking at resource concerns created by its own data centers. Monica Witt is a sustainability program manager at the federal Los Alamos National Laboratory, which operates several large data centers in New Mexico. Witt says the lab has to share its water with residents of the city of Los Alamos. "We know that supercomputers and data centers are just going to use more and more water, so communicating to the community how much we're going to use in the next 10 years and planning with them has been really helpful," she said. Witt said the lab has taken several steps to reduce its water use, including reusing wastewater from toilets, sinks and other sources. The tech industry as a whole has been a leader in adopting environmentally sustainable practices — like reusing water and opting for renewable energy sources, says Alfonso Ortega, a professor of energy technology at Villanova University. But for communities that host data centers, Ortega said there are tradeoffs between economic and environmental impacts. "The consumption of their water competes with every other need for that water," Ortega said. "One would hope that community leaders would be able to balance the benefits of having that data center in the community compared to the water that they're going to consume." In South Carolina, Google's request for more water is also raising concerns from Rep. Mark Sanford, who recently wrote a letter urging state regulators to take their time developing a comprehensive plan for managing groundwater, and to delay Google's permit request until more information can be gathered. Duffie said, in some ways, he's pleased that the debate over Google's data center is heightening local awareness about the long-term sustainability of the water supply. "It's raised the issue that these resources are not limitless," he said, "that we do need to manage them."

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Accessories Samsung just launched Bixby, so of course Samsung-owned Harman is making a Cortana speaker Zach Epstein @zacharye May 8th, 2017 at 9:16 AM Share Tweet Samsung makes smartphones that run Android and smartphones that run Tizen. It has made watches and TVs that run Android as well as watches and TVs that run Tizen. It makes notebook computers that run Windows and notebook computers that run Chrome OS. In fact, Samsung even makes an Android smartphone that can power a desktop computing experience and run Windows virtually. Since the company insists on working with every operating system it can get its hands on, it stands to reason that Samsung would also fragment its virtual personal assistant offerings. The company’s fresh new flagship Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ gave the world its first look at Bixby, and they also ship with Google’s personal assistant, Google Assistant. Now, a new leak reveals that Samsung-owned Harman Kardon is about to launch an Amazon Echo rival that uses Microsoft’s Cortana as its voice-powered virtual assistant. Confused yet? Good, because Samsung is obviously quite confused as well. Don't Miss: Amazon just discounted the Echo for the first time in 2017 At this point, we have to imagine that Samsung is working on its own in-house rival to the likes of the Google Home speaker and Amazon’s Echo (which is on sale right now for the first time in 2017). After all, this is a hot market segment right now, and Apple is said to be working on a Siri speaker. Samsung recently acquired Harman, though, and the company’s Harman Kardon brand is about to launch an assistant speaker as well. As caught by Windows blog Thurrott.com, Harman Kardon briefly put up a “coming soon” page on its site showing off the new Invoke, a smart speaker that uses Microsoft Cortana in the same way Amazon uses Alexa on its Echo speakers and on the Amazon Tap. Not much is available at this time as far as details go, and the page has since been taken down. It stands to reason that the company is prepping for an official unveiling in the near future, though, and we can all imagine how such a product will likely work. A couple more images from the Invoke page follow below. UPDATE: The speaker is now official.

Representational image. Reuters At least eight civilians were killed on both sides in fighting that began when a Pakistani census team accompanied by soldiers visited disputed villages along the southern border on Friday. Pakistan inherited its 2,400-kilometre (1,500-mile) border with its western neighbour when it gained independence from Britain in 1947, but Afghanistan has never formally recognised it. And while official Afghan maps reflect the so-called "Durand Line", many nationalists believe the true border of their country ends at the River Indus that runs through Pakistan and gave India its name. "Officials from the geological survey departments of the two countries will conduct a survey, and they will also make use of Google Maps," said a senior Pakistani security source in Islamabad who requested anonymity. Abdul Razeq, the police chief of Afghanistan's Kandahar province, added: "After negotiations, both sides have agreed that a geological survey should be conducted. "Technical teams of both countries will use GPS and Google Maps as well as other means to get the answer." Internet firm Google complies with local laws in certain countries that compel it to show borders in line with national demands. For instance, its Indian site shows the entirety of disputed Kashmir as controlled by India. In Pakistan, however, the site shows the internationally recognised de facto border, the Line of Control, marked with a dotted line to denote it is disputed. In 2010 Google was embroiled in a Central American border dispute that saw two neighbouring countries dispatch troops and heavily armed police to their joint border. The incident happened after a Nicaraguan commander cited Google's version of the border map in an interview with Costa Rican newspaper La Nacion to justify a raid on a disputed area of Costa Rica. Google later said it had made a mistake and corrected its map to reflect one sanctioned by the US State Department. Pakistan last year began trying to harden the traditionally soft border with Afghanistan through trenching and fencing, but its efforts were met with hostility from Kabul. Ethnic Pashtuns living in the region have traditionally paid it little heed. Villages straddling the frontier have mosques and houses with one door in Pakistan and another in Afghanistan. Pakistani forces on Sunday elevated their rhetoric when they said they had also killed "more than 50 soldiers" in last week's border clashes -- a claim quickly rejected by Kabul, which said it lost two soldiers. #Abdul razeq#Afghanistan#Durand line#Geological survey departments#Google maps#Line of control#Newstracker#Pakistan#Pakistani census team Published Date: May 08, 2017 06:51 pm | Updated Date: May 08, 2017 06:51 pm Also See Peaceful Afghanistan not in Pakistan's interest: The truth and lies behind Islamabad's interference in Kabul Provocative statements by India will further vitiate environment, says Pakistan after MEA statement BSF hands over 15-year-old intruder in Indian territory to Pakistani authorities T20 LEAGUE SCHEDULE Match Date Details 1 May 9 KXIP Vs KKR 2 May 10 GL Vs DD 3 May 11 MI Vs KXIP 4 May 12 DD Vs RPS 5 May 13 GL Vs SRH Full Schedule Top Stories Fodder scam: All you need to know about the 21-year-old case against Lalu Prasad Yadav Aam Aadmi Party Live: Kejriwal Promises to Reveal 'Massive Conspiracy' in Assembly Sohail Mahmood, Pakistan's new High Commissioner to India, will constantly walk a tightrope SS Rajamouli's Baahubali follows Telugu cinema's long tradition of mythological films Are you a contrarian trader?
