Google / Google I/O 2017: what are we expecting? By Hadlee Simons on 15 May, 2017 The annual Google I/O developer conference kicks off on Wednesday and, much like Apple‘s WWDC and Microsoft‘s BUILD, you can expect some consumer-focused news as well. Last year saw more Android N news, Google’s Daydream VR and a few communication apps. But what can we expect this time? More Android O features revealed We already know that Android O is on the way, bringing battery savings (via more efficient location updates and background services) and notification channels for improved alerts. But Google almost certainly has more features to show here, such as the recently revealed Project Treble for faster updates, expanded support for Instant Apps and a few unannounced easter eggs. An Android Wear update? Last year’s conference saw Google reveal Android Wear 2.0, being a massive update for Android-toting smartwatches. It’s been a while since then, and the update is still trickling out to smartwatches. Could we see Android Wear 3.0 revealed then? I’m not 100% sure, but don’t be surprised if we get Android Wear 2.1 or something similar. In any event, Google’s last update showed off watch face “complications” and reduced the reliance on carrying a phone around. So we expect to see a bit more of this. Daydream VR to be more than a daydream? The Daydream VR initiative was first revealed a year ago, outlining Google’s vision for mobile virtual reality. From headsets and controllers to phones, Google planned to slap a variety of devices with “Daydream” certification. Fast forward to 2017 and we’ve only got five or six compatible smartphones. We expect Google to announce expanded support of sorts, bringing Daydream VR to more than just a few flagship devices. Still, we’re not sure if Google will relax the minimum requirements for the VR suite, but we do look forward to the platform on more devices. Now, when can we expect Daydream hardware in SA? More communication apps? Google revealed Allo and Duo at last year’s event, being yet another communications push from the tech company. Don’t rule out Google revealing another communications app, joining Allo, Duo, Hangouts and Android Messages/Messenger. Google has been pushing the RCS protocol in recent months though, being billed as a successor to SMS technology. Here’s hoping if they do release a new app, it’s a great demonstration of RCS. What about ChromeOS? Google’s laptop platform has shot past Macs to become the most popular OS in the education sphere. Throw in Google Play Store support and it’s clear that Google has a winner on their hands. Unfortunately, the Play Store functionality has been delayed, so we’re expecting to see more clarification in this department. One thing is for certain though, and it’s that apps built for Android O are set to receive better keyboard support, as Google preps the Play Store apps for launch on ChromeOS. More Google Assistant-powered products? Amazon paved the way for the smart speaker when it revealed the Echo gadget, powered by its Alexa AI service. Since then, we’ve seen Alexa make its way to the Echo Show smart screen and numerous appliances. I’m personally expecting Google to reveal new Assistant-powered hardware — be it a new Google Home-style device or a partnership with a third-party manufacturer. In fact, I wouldn’t be surprised if we see a family of third-party Google speakers being launched. What about hardware? Aside from our above-mentioned prediction of Google Assistant-powered gadgets, we’re not sure whether Google will have more traditional devices to reveal. We didn’t see phones, tablets or computers being revealed last year, while 2015 saw the Nexus 9 being shown off. It has been two years since a new Google tablet, then… The budget phone enthusiast in me is hoping for a much improved Android One programme, but otherwise, don’t expect new Pixel phones obviously.

Open GApps can now optionally install Google Assistant Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/02/02 8:38am PDTFeb 2, 2017 53 Plus 1 on G+ 244 Share on Facebook 105 Share on Twitter Total Shares402 Applications Google News Google Assistant was introduced at Google I/O last year, as a more personal voice assistant than Google Now. Since then, it has been made available on several platforms - Pixel phones, the Google Home, Android TV, and Allo. But Assistant is still unavailable on non-Pixel phones without a special build.prop tweak. Now the Open GApps team has made enabling Assistant a little easier. Starting February 3, all GApps builds will have the option to enable Google Assistant. If you're using the Gapps 'Aroma' zip, Google Assistant shows up as an option during installation. If you prefer one of the non-GUI installers, you can add the 'GoogleAssistant' keyword to the gapps-config file. Google Assistant is marked as an optional feature right now due to it not having the full feature set of Google Now. You can download all Open GApps packages here, but keep in mind that only builds starting tomorrow will include the option for Assistant.

Now on tap with google now is 100 times better. Most functions are missing from google now. Christopher Bement Works for what I need it for and it's one less tap. So, me. I want it. T4rd I just started trying Assistant with the latest PureNexus ROM on my 6P. The only thing I'm missing is the ability to copy text from screenshots/images. Seems to do everything else so far and it's much faster at reading your voice and responding. Duder12 I dont think you know what Google Now is. Google Now is the proactive assistant that shows cards about your life on the left homescreen and is still on Pixel phones. Now on tap does nothing but read your screen which honestly no one used and is being built into google assistant anyways. Suyash Limaye I use now on tap a lot. Especially ability to copy text from screenshots, copying numbers from messages etc. None of these things can be done by assistant. Also assistant can identify songs yet another missing feature. I never complained about now cards. demarcmj What used to be called "Now on Tap" is baked into Assistant. You can do all of those things with Assistant. I don't know about the identifying of songs. I use separate apps for that anyway. _jack_ I used it a lot, it is perfect for sharing screenshots without having them saved in the gallery app. Also for things like movie trailers, locations etc. it works pretty well. jonzey231 Yep, I took 100% of my screenshots this way. Never having to worry about deleting screenshots is amazing. demarcmj That's still available in Assistant Corbin Davenport Taking screenshots wasn't available in Assistant when it was first released, but now it is. demarcmj right jonzey231 Nope. Used it all the time. demarcmj Although Suyash is definitely wrong about the "100 times better" and "most functions are missing" comments, his (or her?) terminology is fine. What Google Now "is" has always been a bit unclear, because it is all just part of the same "Google" app. It is generally understood to mean the cards/feed AND the voice search. Khanjan Damania Does it require device name changes in build.prop to 'Pixel XL' or will it work on all devices regardless? megatomic This is a good question. SpasilliumNexus It shouldn't. All that's needed is the entry "ro.opa.eligible_device=true" in build.prop and a fairly recent version of the Google App. This works on Nougat, not sure about Marshmallow as I used to use Xposed for it. Even then it never spoofed my device as a Pixel. brkshr That's good to know. I didn't like my 6P showing as an XL. Just made the change back and Assistant still works. Grassy ass. Maxr1998 Apparently on MM it requires/d? device name spoofing for some people, but that never affected the Xposed module, as it just overrides the Assistant methods and bypasses any device name checks (if they do (still) exist). Source: I created the Xposed code. Sergey Wain-Fellowes (My Zest Can you give me a step by step how to do this on my Nexus 6P Mark Washington Requires Root?🤔 Patryk lul TechGuy22 maybe he just woke up lol Gjorgi Lazarovski no it does not Mark Washington You first. 🤔 ADofCLE "If you want it, you have to root". It's great that Google encourages rooting but, I don't want to. It should just be updated with the Google app. Always making things now complicated than they have to be. Gjorgi Lazarovski Google doesn't encourage rooting, they encourage buying a Pixel :) Ryan Cavitt You dont even have to flash TWRP, you can just do fastboot boot /path/to/twrp.img Then install your zip and reboot. That is assuming Opengapps' stock mode will enable you to install Assistant. Gjorgi Lazarovski Didn't know about that! Adb is amazing :) the Aroma package is the best deal IMHO, you can choose whatever you want installed/uninstalled in a simpler way for the user. Sadly is only for people who don't have data caps since 1 package is aprox 800MB in size trwnh This doesn't work on all devices. For example, the HTC 10 doesn't have "fastboot boot" support. Ben Bayes But unlocking the bootloader breaks SafetyNet and thus Android Pay, right? That's a reason I wouldn't want to do this... Gjorgi Lazarovski You have two choices, relock the bootloader which will be a pain in the ass when your next update comes or flash a custom kernel that hides the bl unlocked flag from SN, so you'd be fine. I can see how a stock user wouldn't want to do this and it might seem like too much, but it really isn't and I really think using adb to update is cleaner than using OTA. Haizum74 Wait, there's a custom kernel that hides the unlocked flag? How have I missed this? Is there any particular kernel you suggest? Randroid My bootloader is unlocked and I pass SN... chandrizzle You don't need root to apply the changes, but Verity (verified boot) needs to be disabled for the changes to stick. In the end, it's easier to just root because Verity is disabled when you go through the root process (which is what I ended up doing). D13H4RD2L1V3 That applies to the systemless method as well? Because my Moto Z is rooted via systemless root (Superuser) and the "oem_status" on the bootloader screen says "Modified" after. dm-verity doesn't seem to be tripped, though or my phone would be stuck in a bootloop by now and I would have to reflash the stock firmware. chandrizzle Maybe I used the wrong term for verification, but yes? I'm systemless rooted on all of my devices and below is what I experienced: Since the build.prop (modified to get Assistant) is one of the files that's verified at boot, it will revert any changes on reboot. I would verify the build.prop contents with adb push and pull before and after reboot. However, I used to flash modified hosts files without any modifications to /system (no root of any kind) and they would stick (bonus: ad block with working Android Pay). Makay Chapulets Hi! Can you suggest how I can use ADB to edit my build.prop to enable on screen nav bar? I don't like the hardware button on my phone... It's a mediatek 6583 and runs Android 6.0 chandrizzle I have a Mac and a Nexus, so your experience may vary. Disclaimer: I'm not responsible for what happens to your device... yadda, yadda, yadda Connect the phone to the computer with USB Boot into recovery [adb reboot recovery] Select "Mount /system" Enter this command (pick your save location): adb pull /system/build.prop /location/to/save/file Open up the build.prop in a text editor and make your edits Use the "Save as" command so you have a backup of your original Enter command: adb push /location/of/edited/build.prop /system/build.prop Reboot *Just a warning, if you have encryption or any other protection, the changes might not stick. The verified boot may undo your changes at startup. If you're already rooted, then you should be fine.* Pro tip: you can use drag and drop (folders/files) on your terminal window so that you don't have to type full paths Makay Chapulets Once I boot into recovery the minimal ADB terminal won't recognize my device anymore ADofCLE It's been a while since I've done anything like this. I was still under the impression that root access was needed to flash a system file. Daniel Marcus Of course, I'd rather like it if Google would make Assistant properly available on the Home and Nexus 5x. sweenish But not the 6P. Shane DeRidder I wish I had this on my 6P.... I just don't want to root. raptir I'm not sure I understand what has happened here. I've been running opengapps for a few weeks on my OnePlus 3T on a Nougat ROM and I have had Google Assistant available bundled into the stock Google app. It comes up instead of Now on Tap. How is this different? Gjorgi Lazarovski it's for stock users and roms that dont have GA enabled dblock The real question is, did they fix the issues with hotword enrollment in OpenGapps? Google Assistant is already optionally able to be installed through build.prop tweaks while using any Gapps package, but if the package doesn't allow for full functionality (OK Google activating while screen is off) then what is the point in the first place? danifeb I love you Nexus 5 JohnA Damn I love Android. No walls here!! Dragos Lucian The Assistant can be easily activated by a ROM's dev with only one commit (2 for things to be completed). OpenGapps are a mess and have been for a long time. The xda threads get countless complains about system apps being removed when flashing opengapps or other weird issues. The latest thing they do is to remove the pixel launcher which gets you stuck if you don't know how to get out of the trouble. I specifically instructed people to not flash them in my thread just to avoid any complains about broken stuff. Lateef Alabi-Oki It's a shame Google's most loyal customers, Nexus users, can't get Google Assistant via an update. Pneen Android ❤ Richard Corke I already have it on my oneplus one, via the app "get assistant root" it's ment for nexus devices but works fine on my oneplus iron2000 But I don't think Open GApps have "Ok Google everywhere" yet. The issue is still open in Github. TriguyRN I know on custom ROMs it takes a lot of fanangling. psychomaniac189 I HATE google assistant.

Google will announce Assistant for iOS soon, in the US only at launch David Ruddock Follow View All Posts 2017/05/15 7:28am PDTMay 15, 2017 101 Plus 1 on G+ 217 Share on Facebook 140 Share on Twitter Total Shares458 Applications Exclusives News Rumors According to a trusted source, Google plans to announce that the Google Assistant will be launching on iOS soon as a standalone app. The announcement could come as soon as Google's I/O conference this week, but it's unclear exactly what Google's plans are at this time. The app would likely feature a blend of the "chat" style functionality in the Google Allo version of Assistant and the voice-controlled version found on Android, but again, details are scant. We do know that the Assistant for iOS will only be available in the US at launch, and that Google plans to make the announcement in fairly short order. I/O would be a pretty ideal venue for such a launch, as Assistant's SDK was just made available to developers late last month. Bringing the Assistant to the world's second-largest mobile OS would likely encourage more developers to integrate with the app's functionality. As we learn more about this story, we'll bring it to you. For now, just know that Assistant on iOS is imminent. While we are labeling this story a "rumor" because we don't know what Google's exact timeframe for announcing this news is, we're highly confident that the information we were provided is accurate.

I've given up checking for it now. Winston Indonesian here. ALL of my devices have it. Since 2 months ago or so. krazyfrog Got it from the day they announced. You probably just need to clear your Google Play services cache or change device language to English US. Alex Yes, I believe that changing the device language to "English US" works, but that's pretty much stating that it's still US only, as you have to pretend to be from US. Shahin Just adding it as a second option works, provided you setup Assistant with US only first. That way you don't have to deal with US Englizh. MaximumFish Thinking about it, I get the sneaky suspicion that I don't have it due to having a Google Apps account. I wish they'd offer a route to migrate from Apps to a standard account. Hyperionite Indonesian here. Using English US as my default language. My device have it. Running Android 6 at the moment Latheryin Won't mean much as Apple will still leverage the use of its own over Google. Heck most android users don't use it what makes them think iPhone users will. Martin Because Google are dumb ducks... I use it, but would use it a lot more, if they make it again to Wake up the assistant from the lock screen on any device... Miss so much from my iPhone being able to say "Hey Siri" and set alarm/timer/call even without touching my phone... And not everyone wants to use Pixel phones... :) David Slawotsky Use Trusted Voice in Settings. That will allow you. Martin I guess this is only for Pixel phones. I don't have this in my settings :) Alex Trusted Voice is part of Google's Smart Lock -- it's not just for Pixel. On my stock Galaxy S7, it's under Settings > Lock screen and security > Secure lock settings > Smart Lock Latheryin To be honest I have it on my nexus and never use. It just not something I need. Let alone want to broadcast what I am doing to every one around me. It is almost as bad as people talking on speaker phone in public. Martin It's personal thing. Some will use it, some wont.. :-)) Latheryin I, see a lot less people wanting to use it on IOS. Won't be enough integration when compared. To siri. To be honest they should just keep the AI on the platform they were made for. We all saw how Apple music did on Android. AbbyZFresh Your point. Apple has Siri and Spotlight embedded in their phone and yet the Google search app is one of the most downloaded in the App Store. Latheryin Those numbers seldom mean real downloads and use. Things like download counts and reviews are seldom accurate with places selling downloads and reviews for really cheap Leandro Brandão I wish I could replace Siri with google assistant. Julie Ankrom I don't want either one. I just want "OK google" and doing a search directly, or giving orders directly. I played with Google Assistant for a while and it just adds a middleman. Leandro Brandão I never used assistant, I thought it was a better ok google. Google app always understands me and give me correct answers. JD If anything it's a worse Google Now. but it speaks more naturally? So I guess that's a good thing? I don't even fucking know anymore. OligarchyAmbulance Assistant is activated with "Ok, Google" and does what you are asking for. In what way is it worse or a "middle man" to Google Now (which it replaced)? destinyhud right when i am trying to replace my ipad with Chromebook detachable. i have hopes for Chromebook C2 at IO SupahNin10doh Thank bliming bob! I hate Siri sooo much. SupahNin10doh Now if they'd also bring it to MacOS Ghostx7x And then to Windows 10 Leonardo Baez Soooo I'm on Nexus 6P and have no assistant yet, but iphone is getting it? Outrageous Cat Astrophy http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/03/02/google-assistant-coming-android-6-0-devices/ If your phone doesn't have it blame your cell provider, not Google. Filipe Santos You have if you choose the supported languages, otherwise no. I changed but if you have your second language, your native language messages will be spoken so damn bad you can't understand or speak sh*t RickJ How does Google expect anyone to want switch from​ iPhone to their phone when they​ keep giving everything away to Apple for free? Keep some things to yourself, Google! Some exclusive incentives for them to switch. Adam Margeson Google doesn't care about switching people to Android. They only care about getting customer data. They can sort-of do that if they keep getting their apps over to iOS. And then provide subtle hints that "Android integrates all of this to make things easier... if you care to switch over." (Not to say that they do integrate things better... just look at the Assistant-on-different-devices fiasco) lauski I'd agree they don't care AS MUCH, but they do care to some degree... Look, they officially have entered the hardware business with the pixels. Right now you're right-- whatever sales they might marginalize are far outweighed by marketing dollars and customer info. The opposite is true for Apple, which is why we won't be enjoying an official iMessage and Facetime release on the Play Store any time soon... Zach Mauch I might at the "[Exclusive]" to this just so i is obvious that it is info from AP. Artem Russakovskii "I might at the "[Exclusive]" to this just so i is obvious that it is info from AP." A little attention when typing? Régis Knechtel https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/b02bffe886fcaf1c5490199c0b7fa03f201960050d66218052c281973c4f9283.gif ADofCLE I knew this was coming. They always release their products on iOS. Even though it really doesn't do anything Google Now already does. Cakefish I haven't even got it on my non-Pixel UK Android phone yet. DragoCubed Surprised yet not surprised they did this. I just wished they'd keep some more android exclusives. Nicholas C YES! I am 95% google here but have an iPhone after the whole Note7 shitstorm JD Too bad you still can't use a default assistant other than Siri. I would totally use Google Now if I could. Fucking Hate Siri that useless hunk of code. Filipe Santos Google stop being an a$$hole, why the hell you release an iOS app if you don't even release on the rest of the languages first or countries? Do you only care about profit? Damn ****** ..... jawsnnn Off topic... It was reported months ago that GA was rolling out to Nexus devices. Is that still happening? Does anyone know? Dave Cremin Lol and I haven't even got it in my 6P. Ridiculous. Brad Wilson I put the Google app on my home screen, because it's so much better than Siri. It's worth the extra step to press the button. I hope that Google assistant becomes better than what I'm using now. Premsuraj Can someone explain to me why the Voice Actions on Google Now can work with a lot of languages including hotword support, but Google Assistant only works with US & UK English? Shouldn't the voice detection be a separate component that can work with any voice assistant? Or atleast they should be able to easily reuse the current implementation Teja I got Assistant on my Oneplus 3 few weeks back, I resetted my device few days back and its gone. Its been 5 days and I'm still waiting to see it. Can anyone help? mike shwilly Ok Google, what is this song?

Google is building full-on Android for the car with Volvo and Audi Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/15 9:33am PDTMay 15, 2017 15 Plus 1 on G+ 78 Share on Facebook 50 Share on Twitter Total Shares143 Android Auto Android OS Google News Today Google has revealed more info on their new standalone Android platform for cars. Unlike Android Auto, which just casts info from your phone onto whatever software your vehicle maker has tossed together, the new system is based on Android and brings some of the same tools Android Auto had natively. Google revealed this initiative at last year's I/O, but there hasn't been much news apart from Chrysler's concept back at CES. Both Audi and Volvo will be making use of the new systems in future vehicles. Both Volvo and Audi appear to have been given a lot of leeway with the UI in the screenshots on Google's blog, things look to be skinned pretty heavily. If Google is allowing car makers that degree of flexibility, I wouldn't expect too much in the way of material design love when it lands in more cars. Even so, more tools and features from Android making their way into your car could come in handy, OEM-skin or not. Not to mention the utility of having some of the same features you did before via Auto without needing your phone around. Google revealed last year that they were thinking about the potential of bringing full Android to cars and showed off a prototype Maserati modified to run the experimental software at last year's I/O (Maserati was not involved, Google and Qualcomm shoehorned the tech into a car on their own). Google has been quiet since then about any news related to the new initiative, or any new names for the program. Given how close this is to I/O there is a good chance we'll hear more at Google's event. Source: Google Tags Android android auto audi cars vehicles volvo subscribe ...

JD In one of the security updates it'll stop my Exhaust from exhausting outside and instead in to the cabin. Don't worry tho it goes away after a reboot and doesn't affect all models. George Google's motto: let's abandon an OS/app/service before it becomes too popular by starting from scratch with another OS/app/service... TechGuy22 LOL you're going to have a ball at this year I/0 since so many shit going to be announced that will get killed off after 6 months George bro, it's been like that EVERY year... get wit the program lol makapav It really took form last year. Spaces, Allo, Duo. That was a whole bucket list. Dennis Ulijn I have a feeling Spaces was made just because they needed some centralized message board idea for I/O. Just in time for I/O and google never looked back... Months later when another app was coming out with the Spaces name they found out it was still alive. Drakenoid Spaces was pretty good, though now we've moved to Classroom and pretty sure it won't get shuttered because schools. Ryne Hager I gotta say this here, since I can't elsewhere. But, I used to think you were just a entertaining mild troll, but given your comments elsewhere I have come to see that you are the entertaining mild troll we need. Keep it up. Kawshik Ahmed At least in this Android never had a official 'Standalone In-Vehicle Infotainment' like QNX and Tizen. There are some unofficial attemps like Hyundai uses Android 2.3 and Honda uses Android4.2 in their car IVI. But this will much safer because Google is working with them. Shining Wing So what happens when the car stops receiving updates? One of the main reasons for Auto using your phone was that you only needed to worry about your phone and app being up-to-date, and phones are a lot more replaceable than cars when the updates stop. Kawshik Ahmed Do you know Hyundai Sonata cars run on Android 2.3 !!!!!! and Honda cars run on Android 4.2 ?? People don't panic about this cars because they don't know they are running Android and not just any Android very very old version of Android but those cars are all fine. Specialized OS's don't need updates. Aaron Anything that connects to the internet needs to be updated, at least for security purposes. And these systems will have to be connected at some level for Maps updates and messages. instinct Yes, people don't care because that's the norm. However, if in 2027 you are running a car with a ten year old OS and someone else is running a current OS, people may start to care. The big problem I see right now is that Android Auto now doesn't really seem to have any aftermarket products with really good screens. Ryne Hager That is an excellent question. I hope we get more info at I/O. syxbit When I bought my last TV, I deliberately got one without Android TV, because of the pathetic updates. I just purchased a Shield. I'm happy to buy a new Shield TV every 2-3 years, but I'm expecting my TV to last 5+ years. This is exactly what I'll do with my next car purchase. I'd rather the car just support the old Android Auto, so I can keep getting new phones every 1-2 years. I will never purchase a car with Android built in unless there's a clear promise of updates for MANY years. Ryne Hager I very much agree. Wait till you see my "What we use" post. I have a feeling you're gonna love it. marcusmarcus2 How often are the infotainment systems in cars updated now? If "Project Treble" comes into fruition, then it could actually improve infotainment system updates compared to current ones. Sean Leckie XDA? :) Suyash Bansal Maybe they could use the new update mechanism they are talking about Android O which makes it easier for manufacturers to update device. h4rr4r That will never get updated. The car should just display the phone screen. Jon Fridman I was going to buy a Volvo XC60 later this year, hopefully AA integration will work better than some other cars. It won't be the new version like they're working on, but at least it'll be there. Alexey Vasilyev I have Volvo XC60 MY14 running Sensus Connected Touch (Android 2.3). UI is very fluid. But I got a lot of problems. First Volvo want 400 EUR per year to keep iGO maps updated. I made a root and installed Waze - it works very good. But 3 years have passed (not a lot for cars) and now some features are not working. For example Liveradio app (which is just a list of radio URLs) is not working anymore - server shutdown. I think the best way for such systems is to use Mirrorlink. At least you can keep apps updated. JD Wooo Now I gotta get a new car every 2 years Bru [971] That's funny. Audi was reticent to add Android Auto support to it's cars Deeco "Car has unexpectedly stopped working" icyhotmike I bought a headunit with Dual bluetooth pairing, HD, Spotify, I Heart Radio, Pandora, every damn app.. built into it... for $99 (Kenwood KMM-BT318U) It even has an "Android" mode (no idea what it does) So don't waste your money Volvo and Audi Suyash Bansal That's not Android Auto. It's Android Open Accessory protocol (AOA) that lets you control phone-based content icyhotmike I got android auto app on my phone. marcusmarcus2 This would hav ebeen good news a couple years ago when I was hoping for my Nexus Lexus...Pixel ruined that dream. boop Auto may be the only extension of Android that Google's handled well. By making it an app it's not dependent on either the car or the phone for updates, you don't even need to buy a new car or head unit as you can just run it on your phone and, working under the assumption that this is built on O with Treble, updating the car itself shouldn't even be an issue (unlike all the Android TVs stuck on Marshmallow and the Watches still waiting on Wear 2.0). Paul Lemelin Harley needs to go in this direction and I don't care if it's an Android or iOS solution because their Harmon Kardon Infotainment system is the absolute WORST! Shahin iPhone users be like, "will it also come with lag, malware and inconsistent updates?" Suyash Bansal At least it'll work better compared to Apple's Carplay 😂 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeESbGPl_Dw Harsh patil Does this mean a slow death to Android Auto from now until such OS is lanuched? JG Tesla should be involved with this. They already have a big tablet installed front and center. And, from what I heard, Tesla had approached Google in regards to potentially using Android for their system. Google informed them Android wasn't, then, ready to be used in cars. But obviously now... It would allow Tesla to quickly add more apps available. Then you could use any music streaming service, without having to wait for Tesla to build the app for their platform.

USA TODAY A journalist is pictured at work reading news articles about cyber attacks in Istanbul, Turkey, (Photo: Sedat Suna, EPA) 473 CONNECTTWEET 2 LINKEDIN 6 COMMENTEMAILMORE Clues point to a link between a hacking group connected to North Korea and the ransomware attacks that have crippled computer systems worldwide, according to two cyber-security firms. Experts at the global cyber-security firm Symantec found that earlier versions of the ransomware known as WannaCry were found on computers that also bore evidence of the cyber tools used against Sony Pictures Entertainment, as well as banks in Poland and Bangladesh's central bank— attacks that all were linked to North Korea. Also, a researcher at Google singled out an identical code used both in the ransomware and used by the Lazarus Group, a team of hackers tied to North Korea, noted Symantec. In a blog post, Moscow-based Kaspersky Lab showed screens of the code, first identified in a tweet by Google researcher Neel Mehta, who pointed to the similarity between a WannaCry sample from February 2017 and a sample from Lazarus from February 2015. "The scale of the Lazarus operations is shocking. The group has been very active since 2011," said Kapersky in the blog. Related: How U.S. dodged a bullet in Friday's massive global ransomware attack Bitcoin ransomware demand shows criminal links are hard to shake NSA says it was not origin of ransomware that hit Microsoft's Windows North Korea, buoyed by successful test, says its nukes can reach U.S. Microsoft, whose older Windows operating system was the target of the ransomware that a quarter-million computers in 150 countries, has blamed the National Security Agency for stockpiling cyberweapons that were then stolen and used to form the attack, a scenario echoed by cybersecurity firms. U.S. homeland security adviser Tom Bossert said Monday WannaCry was not a tool developed by the NSA to hold ransom data, but he did not address if the vulnerability was based on stolen NSA cyber tools. The U.S. has had run-ins with North Korea's hackers before. In 2014, the United States charged North Korea with attacking computers at Sony in retaliation for the creation of a comedy titled "The Interview" that was about a C.I.A. plot to kill North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un. Researchers warned that despite the findings, it could it could be months before any definitive link can be proven.  "At this time, all we have is a temporal link," Symantec investigator Eric Chien told the New York Times. "We want to see more coding similarities ...  to give us more confidence.’’ In the WannaCry attack, which started Friday, the attackers have demanded $300 per computer in payments to unlock infected computers, a scheme that paralyzed computers at U.K. hospitals, a Spanish telephone company, and European car factories. But payouts so far have yet to top $100,000, according to firms tracking the attackers' bitcoin accounts. Could there be another reason? Security researcher Matthieu Suiche, of Comae Technologies in the United Arab Emirates, said the hackers may be sending a message in some of the code that's showing up, suggesting their purpose is to stir political mayhem.

Google will announce Assistant for iOS soon, in the US only at launch David Ruddock Follow View All Posts 2017/05/15 7:28am PDTMay 15, 2017 101 Plus 1 on G+ 217 Share on Facebook 140 Share on Twitter Total Shares458 Applications Exclusives News Rumors According to a trusted source, Google plans to announce that the Google Assistant will be launching on iOS soon as a standalone app. The announcement could come as soon as Google's I/O conference this week, but it's unclear exactly what Google's plans are at this time. The app would likely feature a blend of the "chat" style functionality in the Google Allo version of Assistant and the voice-controlled version found on Android, but again, details are scant. We do know that the Assistant for iOS will only be available in the US at launch, and that Google plans to make the announcement in fairly short order. I/O would be a pretty ideal venue for such a launch, as Assistant's SDK was just made available to developers late last month. Bringing the Assistant to the world's second-largest mobile OS would likely encourage more developers to integrate with the app's functionality. As we learn more about this story, we'll bring it to you. For now, just know that Assistant on iOS is imminent. While we are labeling this story a "rumor" because we don't know what Google's exact timeframe for announcing this news is, we're highly confident that the information we were provided is accurate.

Martin You are wrong. Beta is on Android. We test it, then they release it better working on iOS... We keep testing... :-)) Bewear Sad, but true. JD Correction. Google services is always beta. When something is about to Go Gold they shut it down and offer 3 competing products. Because Fuck you that's why. - Google. Filipe Santos You won! King_Android Naw, iOS users would have the first Alpha version of GA while we wait for the rollout to hit our Android devices. Maxwell “Max” Weinbach I have had it for months. S7 Edge and Nexus 6P ADofCLE He's referring to the typical release of Google services. He was being sarcastic. rohiggidy google now/voice search is on IOS. We all expected this MaximumFish "In the US only at launch". Isn't that *still* the case for the Android version? No-one I know if the UK has got it yet, except Pixel users obviously. I've given up checking for it now. Winston Indonesian here. ALL of my devices have it. Since 2 months ago or so. krazyfrog Got it from the day they announced. You probably just need to clear your Google Play services cache or change device language to English US. Alex Yes, I believe that changing the device language to "English US" works, but that's pretty much stating that it's still US only, as you have to pretend to be from US. Shahin Just adding it as a second option works, provided you setup Assistant with US only first. That way you don't have to deal with US Englizh. MaximumFish Thinking about it, I get the sneaky suspicion that I don't have it due to having a Google Apps account. I wish they'd offer a route to migrate from Apps to a standard account. Hyperionite Indonesian here. Using English US as my default language. My device have it. Running Android 6 at the moment Latheryin Won't mean much as Apple will still leverage the use of its own over Google. Heck most android users don't use it what makes them think iPhone users will. Martin Because Google are dumb ducks... I use it, but would use it a lot more, if they make it again to Wake up the assistant from the lock screen on any device... Miss so much from my iPhone being able to say "Hey Siri" and set alarm/timer/call even without touching my phone... And not everyone wants to use Pixel phones... :) David Slawotsky Use Trusted Voice in Settings. That will allow you. Martin I guess this is only for Pixel phones. I don't have this in my settings :) Alex Trusted Voice is part of Google's Smart Lock -- it's not just for Pixel. On my stock Galaxy S7, it's under Settings > Lock screen and security > Secure lock settings > Smart Lock Latheryin To be honest I have it on my nexus and never use. It just not something I need. Let alone want to broadcast what I am doing to every one around me. It is almost as bad as people talking on speaker phone in public. Martin It's personal thing. Some will use it, some wont.. :-)) Latheryin I, see a lot less people wanting to use it on IOS. Won't be enough integration when compared. To siri. To be honest they should just keep the AI on the platform they were made for. We all saw how Apple music did on Android. AbbyZFresh Your point. Apple has Siri and Spotlight embedded in their phone and yet the Google search app is one of the most downloaded in the App Store. Latheryin Those numbers seldom mean real downloads and use. Things like download counts and reviews are seldom accurate with places selling downloads and reviews for really cheap Leandro Brandão I wish I could replace Siri with google assistant. Julie Ankrom I don't want either one. I just want "OK google" and doing a search directly, or giving orders directly. I played with Google Assistant for a while and it just adds a middleman. Leandro Brandão I never used assistant, I thought it was a better ok google. Google app always understands me and give me correct answers. JD If anything it's a worse Google Now. but it speaks more naturally? So I guess that's a good thing? I don't even fucking know anymore. OligarchyAmbulance Assistant is activated with "Ok, Google" and does what you are asking for. In what way is it worse or a "middle man" to Google Now (which it replaced)? destinyhud right when i am trying to replace my ipad with Chromebook detachable. i have hopes for Chromebook C2 at IO SupahNin10doh Thank bliming bob! I hate Siri sooo much. SupahNin10doh Now if they'd also bring it to MacOS Ghostx7x And then to Windows 10 Leonardo Baez Soooo I'm on Nexus 6P and have no assistant yet, but iphone is getting it? Outrageous Cat Astrophy http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/03/02/google-assistant-coming-android-6-0-devices/ If your phone doesn't have it blame your cell provider, not Google. Filipe Santos You have if you choose the supported languages, otherwise no. I changed but if you have your second language, your native language messages will be spoken so damn bad you can't understand or speak sh*t RickJ How does Google expect anyone to want switch from​ iPhone to their phone when they​ keep giving everything away to Apple for free? Keep some things to yourself, Google! Some exclusive incentives for them to switch. Adam Margeson Google doesn't care about switching people to Android. They only care about getting customer data. They can sort-of do that if they keep getting their apps over to iOS. And then provide subtle hints that "Android integrates all of this to make things easier... if you care to switch over." (Not to say that they do integrate things better... just look at the Assistant-on-different-devices fiasco) lauski I'd agree they don't care AS MUCH, but they do care to some degree... Look, they officially have entered the hardware business with the pixels. Right now you're right-- whatever sales they might marginalize are far outweighed by marketing dollars and customer info. The opposite is true for Apple, which is why we won't be enjoying an official iMessage and Facetime release on the Play Store any time soon... Zach Mauch I might at the "[Exclusive]" to this just so i is obvious that it is info from AP. Artem Russakovskii "I might at the "[Exclusive]" to this just so i is obvious that it is info from AP." A little attention when typing? Régis Knechtel https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/b02bffe886fcaf1c5490199c0b7fa03f201960050d66218052c281973c4f9283.gif ADofCLE I knew this was coming. They always release their products on iOS. Even though it really doesn't do anything Google Now already does. Cakefish I haven't even got it on my non-Pixel UK Android phone yet. DragoCubed Surprised yet not surprised they did this. I just wished they'd keep some more android exclusives. Nicholas C YES! I am 95% google here but have an iPhone after the whole Note7 shitstorm JD Too bad you still can't use a default assistant other than Siri. I would totally use Google Now if I could. Fucking Hate Siri that useless hunk of code. Filipe Santos Google stop being an a$$hole, why the hell you release an iOS app if you don't even release on the rest of the languages first or countries? Do you only care about profit? Damn ****** ..... jawsnnn Off topic... It was reported months ago that GA was rolling out to Nexus devices. Is that still happening? Does anyone know? Dave Cremin Lol and I haven't even got it in my 6P. Ridiculous. Brad Wilson I put the Google app on my home screen, because it's so much better than Siri. It's worth the extra step to press the button. I hope that Google assistant becomes better than what I'm using now. Premsuraj Can someone explain to me why the Voice Actions on Google Now can work with a lot of languages including hotword support, but Google Assistant only works with US & UK English? Shouldn't the voice detection be a separate component that can work with any voice assistant? Or atleast they should be able to easily reuse the current implementation Teja I got Assistant on my Oneplus 3 few weeks back, I resetted my device few days back and its gone. Its been 5 days and I'm still waiting to see it. Can anyone help? mike shwilly Ok Google, what is this song?

Businesses are still reeling from the fallout, and government agencies around the world are investigating. Security researchers have documented similarities between the WannaCry code and malware created by Lazarus group, a hacking operation that has been linked to North Korea. The code similarities were discovered by Google researcher Neel Mehta on Monday. Google declined to comment. The security firm Symantec also found links between Lazarus and WannaCry. It discovered early versions of WannaCry on systems that had been compromised by the Lazarus group’s tools. These versions were different than the ransomware that spread on Friday. It is unclear whether the Lazarus group put the ransomware on those systems, or someone else did. “We have not yet been able to confirm the Lazarus tools deployed WannaCry on these systems,” a Symantec spokesperson said in a statement to CNNTech. “While these connections exist, they so far only represent weak connections. We are continuing to investigate for stronger connections.” Kaspersky Lab, a security company, has also published the similarities. The Lazarus group was linked to the 2014 hack of Sony Pictures and attacks on banks around the world. The latest observations are still a long way from determining whether North Korean hackers were behind the recent global cyberattack, but they demonstrate how researchers go about finding who is to blame. One way is to investigate the code and compare it to samples that known hackers have used in the past. According to Amanda Rousseau, malware researcher at security firm Endgame, it’s difficult to catch cybercriminals. Further, it will be hard to find patient zero, or the first victim that kicked off the spread of the virus. The WannaCry ransomware took computers hostage by encrypting their files and requiring payment to unlock them. It leveraged a Windows vulnerability leaked in a trove of hacking tools believed to belong to the NSA. The ransomware mostly affects businesses and large organizations that use a Windows tool that enables file-sharing. Microsoft released a patch for the vulnerability in March. Rousseau says the malware code indicates there are at least two different parties responsible for it because there are two pieces of the attack that are coded differently. The ransomware itself was not hard to reverse engineer, she said, and indicates that a less experienced person wrote it. Multiple government agencies are committed to tracking down the perpetrators. Finding out who is responsible is called “attribution.” And it is very hard to do. Researchers look for certain identifiable pieces of code or clues on how it was executed, such as text strings or site registrations. But there are tools that hackers use to throw investigators off their tracks. Often, malware code is publicly available, or it can be purchased on digital black markets. According to Michael Flossman, researcher at security firm Lookout, examining the victims can help narrow down the perpetrators — but in the case of WannaCry, hundreds of thousands of machines were affected and there weren’t a ton of similarities in who was hit. The hackers responsible have not received much in return for their efforts. While the ransomware took down hospitals and critical infrastructure, it’s made less than $60,000 in ransom. Security researchers and government agencies have advised businesses not to pay the ransom. Researchers are piecing together where WannaCry came from, and some insight into how hackers used the leaked Microsoft vulnerabilities could be found on the dark web. The dark web is like a second layer of the internet beyond what average people use every day. It can only be accessed via the Tor browser, which gives users a cloak of anonymity and makes it impossible for anyone else to see their activity. Cybersecurity firm CYR3CON collects information from dark web sites and uses it to understand cybersecurity threats. In mid-April, the firm identified a conversation on a popular Russian forum that discussed using the leaked NSA exploits to launch ransomware attacks against hospitals. “The thing most interesting was a conversation that mentioned the specific Windows exploit,” Paulo Shakarian, cofounder and CEO of CYR3CON, told CNNTech. “It mentioned there were tens of thousands of systems that could be targeted, and many of them were in the medical industry.” Though there were many dark web conversations around the tools after they were released in April, this specific thread talked about a ransomware attack strikingly similar to WannaCry. It’s impossible to know who posted it, and it is not evidence that people who participated in the thread were responsible. But law enforcement and researchers can use this information to see what future attacks might look like so companies and users can defend themselves against hacks. “It can give insight into what malicious hackers are looking to target, what tools they will use, and what is the established expertise,” Shakarian said.

(Photo: Reuters) By THE BANGKOK POST 16 May 2017 Print Tweet Email This Story : Your Name Your Email Reciever Email Your Message Send Story E-­commerce in Southeast Asia is ripe for fast­-paced growth given the region’s huge population and growing middle class, but countries need to address existing challenges to help the business reach its full potential, says a Google executive. Southeast Asia is a “hotbed” for mobile internet, with about 130 million people now using smartphones out of a total population of around 630 million, said Marc Woo, industry head for e­-commerce, travel and financial services at Google. In hindsight, he credits AirAsia with starting “the first wave” of e­-commerce in ASEAN as the pioneer in booking of air tickets via its own website, without collaborating with travel agents. Purchasing movie tickets through online platforms has been a very popular second­-wave application, he added. About 60 percent of people in the Asia-Pacific accounted for 40 percent of global e­-commerce sales in the first quarter of this year, he said. Major markets include China and India by virtue of their sheer size, and South Korea, Japan and Australia by virtue of their high purchasing power. “China is at the peak at the moment, with the majority of sales happening through the mobile web and mobile applications,” said Woo. “India is hugely dominated by a couple of large players — Flipkart and Amazon. Japan and Australia are hugely mature markets, probably more mature than the UK and the US in terms of e­commerce penetration and e­commerce savviness by consumers. This really leaves us with Southeast Asia as the next frontier.” The recent purchase by the Chinese giant Alibaba of Lazada, the largest Southeast Asian e­commerce site, in a deal worth US$1 billion, shows how important Southeast Asia is becoming to major players seeking more sales and growth. “With the rising middle class, a hugely connected population, as well as a lot of challenges to solve, [Southeast Asia] has the largest headroom in Asia-Pacific,” said Woo. In 2009, 30 percent of the world’s middle class lived in Asia and it is projected that over two­-thirds of the world’s middle class will be in the Asia-Pacific by 2034, he said. A rising middle class theoretically contributes to a more mature economy, higher disposable income, and digital sophistication. Google Southeast Asia recently conducted research with Singapore­based Temasek Holdings on business­-to-­consumer e­-commerce in ASEAN. At least 6 percent of all retail sales in 2025 are expected to occur through e-­commerce, according to the research. “The top line is this: In less than 10 years, what we see is that internet users [in ASEAN] will triple to 600 million from the current 200 million,” said Woo. “And when it comes to the total size of this sector, what we have projected is that it will reach up to $88 billion in retail e­-commerce gross national product. “Bear in mind that this is only business­-to­-consumer, not consumer­-to-­consumer and business-­to­-business as it is difficult for us to assess those.” As the research has identified, funding is a crucial key for success, said Woo, citing Amazon’s expansion into Southeast Asia starting with Singapore, and how Indian e­-commerce companies have received huge cash injections from Alibaba and Japan’s SoftBank. But logistics still presents a crucial challenge for e-­commerce development in ASEAN countries, excluding Malaysia and Singapore, as the high cost of delivering goods, especially in countries such as Indonesia, makes it harder for online sellers to offer the low prices consumers crave. Related Stories Regulate e-commerce, IT experts warn Digital payment systems are also a challenge. In the Philippines and Vietnam, for example, fewer than 2 percent of consumers use credit cards. “A payment mechanism needs to bridge the whole gap, making it easy for people to insert cash and then transact online or through a device,” said Woo. “To get all these factors in place and to change consumers’ mindset, e­-commerce will grow fast given the ease of transacting through mobile phones, the ease of payment, trust and security factors, quick and seamless delivery, as well as more compelling value­-added services. [ASEAN] may not become a leader in e­-commerce, but it will definitely be number one in terms of growth.” With the exception of Malaysia and Singapore, the e­-commerce business in Asia is different for each Asian country in terms of regulatory and payment issues, said Woo. “For example, if you are a business trying to penetrate China, it is extremely difficult even if you have huge capital and a good relationship with funds. It is not so much the regulations that stop this, [but] it is the consumers who are extremely picky and the fact that they want value all the time,” he said. “All the dominant [Chinese e­-commerce] players constantly innovate; it will not be the same composition five years down the road. One AliExpress employee said it is a different thing to execute every day and there is no planning whatsoever, as consumer behaviour is changing very, very fast.” When it comes to e­commerce, consumers are not loyal “at all,” as they are constantly in search of cheaper price tags, promotions or enhanced digital experiences, Woo noted. And even though the big players, such as Alibaba and Amazon, are expanding their sphere of influence in Asia, there is still room for growth for local e-commerce businesses as seen in the likes of 11street, Lelong and Mudah, all of which have recorded healthy sales and growth. “If you look at e­-commerce as a yardstick in the long term, there are huge marketplaces and huge horizontal players, but once that happens you will see more of the niche guys coming on board. They will only sell shoes, bags, electronics, or offer their own products,” he said. This story was originally published by the Bangkok Post here.

While many people visit Kentucky for its rich history, green countryside, and  bourbon famous recipes, Kentucky's art scene is also booming. And it's not just the fine arts that are taking over this southern state; graphic designers throughout Kentucky are proving their work is pretty extraordinary. In fact, we've listed 10 Kentucky designers below—designers whose work is inspirational, innovative, and eye-worthy. This list includes: Seth Eckert Bryan Patrick Todd Lafe Taylor Jasmine Nora Jones Matthew Taylor Wilson Ashley Trommler Noah Jacobus Aaron B. May Jeremy Booth Rachael Sinclair 1. Seth Eckert Seth Eckert is owner and head creative at The Furrow, a Lexington-based creative shop. (Be sure to check out The Furrow's animated logo!) His work consistently impresses us with its seemingly simple design and bold colors. Even if you're not familiar with Eckert, you most likely see his work daily on Facebook—he was the animator behind Facebook's reaction emojis. When you hover over the the “Like” button to find that perfect reaction—you're looking at Eckert's animation sequence. In addition to his extensive social media work, he's also done projects for Google's Santa Tracker and Microsoft Cloud. You can see Eckert's full portfolio by visiting his website, Dribbble, or by following him on Twitter. Eckert's Facebook emojis have been used in promotional videos, and they are available for use on any Facebook post (i.e. you can react to a photo with “sadness” or react to a status with “love.”) With these emojis, you have a broader spectrum of emotional reactions from which to choose. This goes above and beyond a “Like” button (or a “Dislike” button, for that matter). These reactions are a globally recognizable way to channel empathy. Google's Santa Tracker gives those who celebrate Christmas the opportunity to watch Santa's famous journey as he travels the globe. This is a snippet from a past Google Tracker design Eckert helped create. This is Eckert's cut of a video he did for Microsoft Cloud.  The design is complex and modern, using virtually all the space in the image. Eckert's use of shape is something fellow designers should be studying. 2. Bryan Patrick Todd Bryan Patrick Todd hails from Louisville and describes his art as a “steak dinner for the eyes.” Todd has a point (as long as you like steak). His murals are striking, but their eye-catching nature is not due to size alone. Todd's murals caught our eye specifically with their powerful aesthetic. He is a master of typography, choosing fonts that will elevate each project. His diverse portfolio boasts local and international work. Whether it's in the Highlands of Louisville or the streets of Japan, Angel's Envy whiskey or Esquire magazine, Todd's art is leaving a very real mark. Like his slogan, his art taps into an old-fashioned sense of quality and charm. Keep up with Todd's new projects by following him on Instagram, Twitter, or Behance. Nothing says Kentucky quite like KFC! Todd found himself in charge of a mural design for the Kentucky Fried Chicken HQ in Louisville. His piece is a tribute to the company's history and product, and of course, the Colonel himself. Smirnoff worked with Todd to create a global marketing campaign; the brand is often taking chances with its marketing campaigns, and the company teamed with Todd to make an inclusive piece in Tokyo. Because the piece worked as an installation, it became more than an ad—it became interactive. You can read more about this piece on Todd's website. Todd's “unapologetically Kentucky” designs have arguably brought him a great deal of success. His murals can be seen throughout Louisville, including at the Angel's Envy distillery downtown. This distillery, which specializes in bourbon barrel-aged whiskey, encourages tourism with its visitor center, tours, and shop. 3. Lafe Taylor From Lexington, KY is Lafe Taylor, a graphic designer, entrepreneur, and all-around renaissance man. We knew we had to list Taylor in this spread—not only does he specialize in a number of unique design styles, but Taylor also uses contemporary fashion, hairstyles, and pop culture in his art to capture the “here and now” of modern life. In addition to his Dribbble and Tumblr, Taylor co-founded a number of businesses. Don't forget to follow Taylor's Twitter for updates and inspiration! This piece was created for Taylor's daughters. The wide-rimmed glasses, hairstyle, and clothing give this illustration a modern and relevant feel. Taylor's ongoing “Brothas” collection features men of color. The illustrations in this collection are profiles of various characters with various looks. In a commentary about pop culture, Taylor created this piece to discuss the unnecessary but prevalent use of checks. The design is simple, but the message is strong, which can be said for much of Taylor's work. His illustrations are often an indication of what he sees and the celebrities he appreciates. 4. Jasmine Nora Jones Originally a midwestern girl, Jones settled in Kentucky and consistently creates and contributes to unique projects, ranging from art bibles to custom chalkboard designs to large-scale murals. Among other talents, Jones specializes in script-style hand-lettering. Nature, spirituality, and personal growth each plays a part in her designs, and we feel her colorful, feminine stye makes her a perfect addition to this list. You can see her professional portfolio by visiting her website, and be sure to check out her personal projects on Instagram. Originally a design done for Studio Calico, this rustic, hand-lettered pumpkin quickly gained popularity, and Jones was approached by Anthropologie to use the design on a tea towel. Jones, Anthropologie, and Studio Calico were able to collaborate to make the design into Anthropologie product. Through a professional connection, Jones was able to sign on with Zondervan (a branch of a Christian publishing company) for their Beautiful Word Bible. For the piece, Jones initially hand-lettered various verses for one Bible edition, but the company also released other editions, a coloring version, and an inspirational gift book version. Above is a mural Jones did for Starbucks in Springfield, MO. She was contacted by Starbucks HQ to design and complete the mural. This was especially exciting for Jones, whose home state is Missouri. 5. Matthew Taylor Wilson Matthew Taylor Wilson, located in Bowling Green, KY, is a freelancer whose client list includes Urban Outfitters, American Crafts, Every Day with Rachael Ray Magazine, and more. Wilson's one-of-a-kind style makes him a must-have in our list of Kentucky-based artists. Wilson's illustrations cover a wide breadth of content, and that is no coincidence; Wilson has worked to develop various lines of business. He licenses his patterns and lettering for both products and textiles. Additionally, Wilson is part of the Bright Group International, and Wilson's designs for the publications are not to be missed! You are sure to find something you like on Wilson's site, and you can buy his product on Society6, Threadless, and Redbubble. The above image is from American Girl Magazine, part of a spread about young girls who are working to make a difference. Wilson's illustration features Mikaila Ulmer, the 6th grader who won $60,000 on Shark Tank with her great-grandmother's lemonade recipe. Wilson has done a number of pieces for the magazine, and it's just one of his many designs that celebrate youth and imagination. Wilson created a map of Santa's Village, including Santa's house, a candy cane forest, an ice cream skating rink, and more. This illustration is especially fun because the colors and content are made real through the conventions of cartography (e.g. labels, dashes to represent footpaths and trails, etc.). Happy FunTime Friend Club is Wilson's Etsy, where he sells kid-friendly stickers and pins. According to the HFTFC Facebook, the shop “is a collection of hopeful & fun products for kids of all ages.” 6. Ashley Trommler Ashley Trommler works for Fieldtrip, a creative agency located in Louisville. Trommler's appeal, other than her projects and business, lies in her artistic style. Her designs direct the gaze of her audience—a powerful skill she consistently masters. Additionally, her work visually satisfies; she understands the importance of color balance and symmetry. Trommler's portfolio consists of personal projects, company logos, and nonprofit work (including MedWater and City Collaborative, to name a few). You can follow her on Dribbble or Instagram. Trommler and her agency teamed with City Collaborative, a nonprofit that works toward urban development and cultural enhancement. Last fall, the members on the project repurposed vacant lots into pop-up spaces, encouraging community in the area. “Together We Can Flourish” was Trommler's brainchild and one of the first murals in Louisville Visual Art's Mural Art Program. The mural took over a year and works to remind Louisville of its power as a city. Check out the full mural and process here. The above illustration was created for Doc Crows, the Louisville smokehouse and raw oyster bar. Since the restaurant is located on Louisville's historic “Whiskey Row,” they proudly use Trommler's handmade lettering and design on their drink menus.   7. Noah Jacobus Noah Jacobus is an illustrator and product designer “working amongst the bourbon-soaked hills of central Kentucky.” His minimalist designs, nerd-tech style, and bright color palettes make him an obvious choice for our list of bluegrass designers. Jacobus currently works for MetaLab and freelances as well. Check out his portfolio or Dribbble, or follow him on Instagram or Twitter. These houses were designed by Jacobus for MetaLab as part of a web app. Jacobus' use of color and space are great, and the soft tones and detail help us to focus on the important content. Jacobus created an interactive ballpark as part of a fantasy team feature for ESPN.com. Above is just a sample of the entire image, but you can see Jacobus' use of rectangular shapes and how the various parts of the image flow together. Jacobus created this piece shortly before the 2016 election, encouraging fellow Americans to get educated about their ballot and vote. 8. Aaron B. May Aaron B. May is a Covington, KY man whose grunge-inspired designs have made him a fresh talent in the world of graphic design. May's punk-rock style caught our eye, especially with his use of polarizing colors and content. We like his art scene designs, and we love good package design, which there is plenty of on his site. (And don't miss his personal projects, shop, and Instagram!) We loved this design, especially due to its wildly clashing content. “Cute” pastries are dominating the internet, so the shock of the skeleton imagery is pretty rock and roll. May's designs go beyond the page in several ways, and he has quite a bit of product design under his belt. In the photo above, we see his designs for Mayhem Supply Co.'s skateboards. This is from a poster May designed for the Midpoint Music Festival. Like much of his art, he uses a limited color scheme and textured designs. 9. Jeremy Booth Jeremy Booth is Louisville born and bred, and we couldn't help but notice his Mad Men-style, or what his website refers to as “Vector Noir.” Booth's high-contrast, flat still-lifes are wonderfully detailed and vary in color scheme. Booth's appreciation for photography and shadow is extremely evident in his designs, and frankly, we can't get enough of them. Booth has worked with Amazon, Dave Ramsey, Samsung, and more. He has listed a wide variety of work on Dribbble, and you can follow him on Twitter. Eero, a wifi company in San Francisco, contacted Booth about designing a Christmas project. This is a glimpse of the final product, in which subtle indications of wifi-related products are present. Booth created a Christmas palette using nontraditional shades of red and green. Booth created a Kentucky poster, pulling inspiration from vintage travel posters. True to his method, this piece has a very basic color scheme (and it's only fitting that the home to bluegrass and UK would have a blue poster.) You can see the full image here. Recently, Booth did an art exhibit at Sergeant Paper in Paris, France. He had a variety of pieces in the exhibit, including this one. The above design is a perfect example of his “Vector Noir” style. 10. Rachael Sinclair A Kentuckian through-and-through, Rachael has done a variety of custom designs for various clients. The combination of her vintage style and classic training gives her art a timeless aesthetic. Get a full look at her portfolio, or check her out on Behance, Dribbble, or Instagram! VisitLex, a program designed to encourage Lexington tourism, approached Sinclair to do the above mural(s). This was a two-part mural illustration installed at UK's Commonwealth Stadium. Sinclair explains the process on her website, which involved designing and combining separate illustrations. To achieve the look of the final product, Sinclair used Photoshop watercolor brushes. Disney held an “Alice Through the Looking Glass” Art Showcase at Los Angeles' Hero Complex Gallery, and Sinclair was asked to contribute art of her own. For the show, female artists exhibited work inspired by Lewis Carroll's written tales and the subsequent film adaptations. Sinclair designed Louisville Magazine‘s October 2015 cover, for which she combined vintage style and modern conveniences (e.g. flatscreen TV, cell phone, etc.). Sinclair used painting brushes in Photoshop to achieve the look. Check out the full cover here. Above are just a few of Kentucky's incredible designers, and we highly recommend keeping up with their innovative work!

New Atlas Lifestyle Science Technology Transport Search Subscribe Automotive Android to form the base for next-gen Audi and Volvo infotainment Scott Collie May 15, 2017 A look at Volvo's concept XC60 with Android as its infotainment operating system View gallery - 2 images Apple and Google have worked hard to get their feet in the car door with CarPlay and Android Auto, respectively, leveraging their smartphone expertise to create a better in-car experience. Now, Volvo and Audi have teamed up with Google to take things a step further and integrate Android into their next-generation cars. Rather than treating the integration like Android Auto, which only works when a device is connected using a USB cable and relies heavily on the phone's data connection, the next-generation Volvo and Audi setups will actually use Android as the operating system for their infotainment systems. NEW ATLAS NEEDS YOUR SUPPORT Upgrade to a Plus subscription today, and read the site without ads. It's just US$19 a year.UPGRADE NOW Instead of relying on a smartphone app for music streaming, for example, the app could be installed directly onto the car's infotainment system. That means drivers won't need to rely on their phones as much in the car, and aren't left with a second-rate experience if they happen to leave their device at home. Volvo also says embracing the Android ecosystem will allow car owners access to a much wider range of apps than they have at the moment, and the move will make it easier to update older cars with the latest dashboard operating system. Beyond greater app integration, Google also suggests the system could be woven deeper into the car's controls. That would allow drivers to manage things like the air conditioning, sunroof or windows using the infotainment system. Tesla has already integrated this functionality into the Model S and Model X with an in-house interface, but the system isn't Android-based. "With the advent of Android we will embrace a rich ecosystem while keeping our iconic Volvo user interface," says Henrik Green, Senior Vice President of Research and Development at Volvo Cars. "We will offer hundreds of popular apps and the best integrated experience in this broad, connected environment." Google will reveal more details about Android in-car integration at its I/O conference this week. In the meantime, check out what Volvo has to say about it in the video below.

Google Maps v9.53 brings back a setting for transit notifications and prepares for better-informed commutes [APK Teardown + Download] Cody Toombs Follow View All Posts 2017/05/15 6:06pm PDTMay 15, 2017 8 Plus 1 on G+ 28 Share on Facebook 38 Share on Twitter Total Shares74 APK Teardown Applications Downloads News Article Contents 1 What's New 1.1 Return of mass transit station notifications 2 Teardown 2.1 Traffic notifications for your commute 2.2 Set your method of travel for commutes 3 Download An update to Google Maps began rolling out over the weekend and this one appears to be focused on keeping people in the know on their commutes. This version brings back a toggle to control notifications about delays and interruptions at mass transit stations, and this time it might be here to stay. A teardown also shows we'll soon have traffic notifications for the commute between home and work and that more modes of travel will be respected besides just driving and mass transit. What's New Unofficial Changelog: (the stuff we found) Toggle for mass transit station information notifications (again?) Return of mass transit station notifications Users of Google Maps may recall a toggle was added to v9.49 a couple of months ago that gave users a choice about receiving notifications regarding mass transit stations. This was based on work that first appeared in a teardown last year in June, but there had been some changes in the meantime. Perhaps this happened earlier than intended and was was removed shortly afterward. It's back with v9.53 and could be here to stay. On the surface, nothing special has changed from the last time the toggle was added, and there have been similar settings even before that, but some new text seen through a teardown does suggest this implementation is a little more likely to be final. Along with the basic notification title and summary, there are also a few lines that go with the notifications. code <string name="TRANSIT_STATION_NOTIFICATION_SETTINGS_TITLE">Station information</string> <string name="TRANSIT_STATION_NOTIFICATION_SETTINGS_SUMMARY">Get departures and disruptions for nearby stations</string> <string name="TRANSIT_STATION_GENERIC_TERM">Transit Station</string> <string name="TRANSIT_STATION_MORE_DEPARTURES_AND_INFO">More departures and alerts</string> <string name="TRANSIT_STATION_NO_UPCOMING_DEPARTURES">No departures within the next hour</string> <string name="TRANSIT_STATION_WITH_PLATFORM">from Platform %s · %s</string> <string name="TRANSIT_STATION_NEXT_DEPARTURE">Next: %s</string> <receiver android:name="com.google.android.apps.gmm.transit.TransitStationBroadcastReceiver" android:exported="false"> <intent-filter> <action android:name="android.intent.action.BOOT_COMPLETED" /> <action android:name="android.intent.action.MY_PACKAGE_REPLACED" /> </intent-filter> </receiver> <receiver android:name="com.google.android.apps.gmm.transit.TransitStationService" android:exported="false" /> <service android:name="com.google.android.apps.gmm.transit.TransitDepartureBoardFetcherService" android:exported="true" android:permission="com.google.android.gms.permission.BIND_NETWORK_TASK_SERVICE"> <intent-filter> <action android:name="com.google.android.gms.gcm.ACTION_TASK_READY" /> </intent-filter> </service> Where things get a little more detailed is a new prompt that allows users to block notifications for stations that they don't need. In the previous teardown, individual lines – say for busses and subways – could be ignored, but this focuses on the stations, which often have their own distinct issues. <string name="TRANSIT_PER_STATION_BAN_NOTIFICATION_TITLE">Turn off notifications at this station?</string> <string name="TRANSIT_PER_STATION_BAN_NOTIFICATION_TEXT">%s</string> The most telling reason to think this feature is sticking around this time is the text from a pair of new notifications that ask users if they've visited a station and if the transit notifications are helpful to the user. The first is obviously there to gauge accuracy, but the second clearly shows the Maps team is seeking to judge the efficacy of these notifications. In the end, this may determine if they are successful or have to be adjusted. code <string name="TRANSIT_STATION_LOCATION_ACCURACY_NOTIFICATION_TITLE">Were you at this station?</string> <string name="TRANSIT_STATION_LOCATION_ACCURACY_NOTIFICATION_TEXT">%s</string> <string name="TRANSIT_STATION_LOCATION_ACCURACY_NOTIFICATION_RESPONSE_NO">No</string> <string name="TRANSIT_STATION_LOCATION_ACCURACY_NOTIFICATION_RESPONSE_YES">Yes</string> <string name="TRANSIT_STATION_USER_SATISFACTION_NOTIFICATION_TITLE">Are these notifications helpful?</string> <string name="TRANSIT_STATION_USER_SATISFACTION_NOTIFICATION_TEXT">Public transport departures and delays.</string> <string name="TRANSIT_STATION_USER_SATISFACTION_NOTIFICATION_RESPONSE_HELPFUL">Helpful</string> <string name="TRANSIT_STATION_USER_SATISFACTION_NOTIFICATION_RESPONSE_NOT_HELPFUL">Not Helpful</string> There are already some mass transit notifications in both Google Maps and the Google Now stream (or whatever it's being called these days), but this adds another nuance and might save some people from getting stuck somewhere because a station is effectively out of order. I don't live near any mass transit and triggering these notifications generally isn't possible if you're not jumping on a bus or train fairly often, so I'm not sure if these notifications are already operational with this update or if they're still in limbo until further notice. If anybody has started receiving them, let us know in the comments below. Teardown Disclaimer: Teardowns are based on evidence found inside of apks (Android's application package) and are necessarily speculative and usually based on incomplete information. It's possible that the guesses made here are totally and completely wrong. Even when predictions are correct, there is always a chance that plans could change or may be canceled entirely. Much like rumors, nothing is certain until it's officially announced and released. The features discussed below are probably not live yet, or may only be live for a small percentage of users. Unless stated otherwise, don't expect to see these features if you install the apk. Traffic notifications for your commute The Google app has been offering tips about commuting between home and work for a long time, perhaps going back to the initial launch of Google Now in 2012. Now in 2017, it looks like Google Maps is preparing to launch a similar feature of its own. The text taken from the apk is pretty straightforward, noting simply that it's a notification with real-time traffic conditions between your current location and either home or work. It actually sounds a lot like the real-time traffic information we already get, but in the form of a notification. code <string name="TRAFFIC_TO_PLACE_NOTIFICATION_SETTINGS_TITLE">Travel times</string> <string name="TRAFFIC_TO_PLACE_NOTIFICATION_SETTINGS_SUMMARY">See ETAs to home and work</string> <string name="TRAFFIC_TO_PLACE_NOTIFICATION_PROMO_TITLE">Beat the traffic on your commute</string> <string name="TRAFFIC_TO_PLACE_NOTIFICATION_PROMO_CONTENT">Get notifications about real-time traffic conditions, based on your current location</string> <string name="TRAFFIC_TO_PLACE_NOTIFICATION_PROMO_ACCEPT">Turn on</string> <string name="TRAFFIC_TO_PLACE_NOTIFICATION_PROMO_DECLINE">No thanks</string> <receiver android:name="com.google.android.apps.gmm.traffic.notification.service.DismissTrafficToPlaceNotificationReceiver"> <intent-filter> <action android:name="com.google.android.apps.gmm.traffic.notification.service.DismissTrafficToPlaceNotificationReceiver.NOTIFICATION_DISMISSED" /> </intent-filter> </receiver> <receiver android:name="com.google.android.apps.gmm.traffic.notification.service.TrafficToPlaceNotificationGeofenceReceiver"> <intent-filter> <action android:name="com.google.android.apps.gmm.traffic.notification.service.TrafficToPlaceNotificationGeofenceReceiver.ACTION_DISMISS" /> <action android:name="com.google.android.apps.gmm.traffic.notification.service.TrafficToPlaceNotificationGeofenceReceiver.ACTION_UPDATE" /> </intent-filter> </receiver> Why is this being added to Maps when the Google app already does it? I would assume it's there so all of these types of things can be managed in a single place. I doubt it will mean the commute care will be removed from Google Now. While this does create a redundancy between the two apps, it has the notable advantage of giving users some choice about how they would like to receive this information and in which form. Set your method of travel for commutes Google Maps has been very good about supporting different modes of travel for a long time. Google's Navigation feature is pretty great at giving directions whether you're walking, driving, cycling, or hopping onto mass transit. However, when it comes to commuting, it seems like there may have been some assumptions that everybody either drives or uses public transit. It looks like the Maps app wants to give users a little more control over that by allowing users to choose a mode of travel for their commutes. <string name="COMMUTE_CATEGORY_TITLE">Commute</string> <string name="COMMUTE_BASIC_TRAVEL_MODE_SETTINGS_TITLE">Mode of transport</string> <string name="COMMUTE_BASIC_TRAVEL_MODE_BIKING">Cycling</string> <string name="COMMUTE_BASIC_TRAVEL_MODE_DRIVING">Driving</string> <string name="COMMUTE_BASIC_TRAVEL_MODE_TRANSIT">Public transport</string> <string name="COMMUTE_BASIC_TRAVEL_MODE_WALKING">Walking</string> There's not enough information to go on to determine where this setting will show up or what it will be used for precisely. I also can't be sure if this is a single setting that's expected to be the majority of a user's commute or if it will relate to each leg of the trip (e.g. people that drive 20 minutes to a train, then ride for another 20 into a city). Still, there is more attention being paid to these other methods, which means more useful information for those that can use it. Download The APK is signed by Google and upgrades your existing app. The cryptographic signature guarantees that the file is safe to install and was not tampered with in any way.

The border is notoriously porous and difficult to enforce, as invading armies have learned — and it’s been a source of contention between the two governments for decades. The “Durand Line” establishing the border was drawn in the 1890s, by British representatives from Afghanistan and what was then British India. It split the land of ethnic Pashtuns nearly in half. Pakistan inherited the border when it gained independence in 1947, but Afghanistan has never officially recognized it. Pashtuns living on either side of the border traditionally haven’t paid it much attention — they often have more in common with each other than with their respective countries. Things remain tense in the disputed border area, however. Fighting broke out again recently when a Pakistani census group accompanied by soldiers visited villages there, and at least eight civilians were killed. But officials in Pakistan and Afghanistan are signaling that they may be ready for détente. Both sides have agreed to a thoroughly modern solution: using Google Maps and GPS to conduct a geological survey and settle the border issue for good. The process is likely to mirror the original marking of the Durand Line. Back then, representatives pored over maps to negotiate a route before walking it, hammering posts into the ground every few miles. Now, officials from both countries “can walk that border with the GPS, and they can create the digital equivalent of those border posts that they originally marked over 100 years ago,” said Steven Feldman, a digital mapping consultant based in London. The “digital posts” can then be turned into the countries’ borders on Google Maps. But, Feldman said, the technology is just a tool — Pakistan and Afghanistan first have to agree where that border is. “I’m not certain that Google Maps is the answer to their problems.” © Credit: Google The 1,510 mile border between Pakistan and Afghanistan is known as the "Durand Line." Maps reflect political realities, and Google has what Steven Feldman calls a “hierarchy of rules” when it depicts countries. Most borders are widely acknowledged by the international community, and Google denotes these on its maps with a solid line. For disputed places like Palestine, Kashmir, or Crimea, it gets a little more complicated. Google tries to defer to the judgment of international bodies, and it marks contested borders with dotted lines. But the Google map you see can be entirely different depending on where you’re viewing it from. That’s because Google must follow the laws of countries it operates in. The Crimean Peninsula was controlled by Ukraine until Russia invaded in 2014. In Russia, according to the law, Crimea is shown to be part of the country with a solid black line. But in Ukraine and most of the world, Google Maps demarcates Crimea with a dotted line. Google Maps is a private company, Feldman said, and shouldn’t be called upon to arbitrate clashes on the international stage. “It's only states that can bring about dialogue and compromise.” Yet Google is now the largest mapmaker in the world, and as a result, it frequently gets sucked into geopolitics, willingly or not. “I guess, naively perhaps, we hoped we could have one global map of the world that everyone used, but politics is complicated,” Ed Parsons, Google’s geospatial technologist, told The Independent.Google did not immediately respond to The World's request for comment.  The company has been the target of social media campaigns and petitions for not drawing a solid line around Palestine, and sometimes the stakes have been even higher: In 2010, when Google data mistakenly gave a chunk of Costa Rica to Nicaragua, troops were deployed on both sides before the map could be fixed.

[Deal Alert] Get a free official case when you buy a Pixel XL from the Google Store Richard Gao Follow View All Posts 2017/05/14 8:30am PDTMay 14, 2017 11 Plus 1 on G+ 51 Share on Facebook 44 Share on Twitter Total Shares106 Deals Google News Pixel XL It's been a couple of months since the Pixel and Pixel XL debuted, but it's still rare to come across a deal for them, especially on the XL model. In fact, we've posted a total of zero Deal Alerts on the non-Verizon Pixel XL. However, Google itself has decided to offer a free official case to anyone who purchases the Pixel XL from the Google Store. It's pretty simple: add any color/storage level of Pixel XL to your cart, then add either the $30 clear case or the $35 silicone case (your choice of color) to your cart. In your cart, you'll see the 'Buy Pixel XL, receive a Pixel XL Case by Google on us' text, along with a discount of either $30 or $35, depending on which case you got. Unfortunately, this doesn't work on any Live Cases, the LifeProof FRE, or the Otterbox Defender. Want to get in on this deal? Google simply says that the offer will be 'available while supplies last' from when it began at 12am PT today (May 14th). So if you've been eyeing a Pixel XL and a case, but were waiting for some sort of little incentive, now may be the time to pull the trigger.

Google simply says that the offer will be 'available while supplies last" I'm pretty sure they mean while supplies of the phone lasts... Because they'll be out of stock again long before this offer ends. irtechneo Lol yep. Their inventory issues are mind boggling. I finally gave up trying to get one and went with S8+. Glad I did. Andrea Bittau I want to do the same but s8 ( normal )... how is bixby button ? useless ?! :/ irtechneo Bixby button is great! I use the app called bxActions and re-map it to the Google app. I now have a dedicated button for Google. Fantastic. Bixby itself is garbage (IMO). Michael Hannigan Don't. G6 is a better deal and a better phone. And I am a Samsung fanboy/fanman. Michael Hannigan Yeah, great move. Except the Pixel is a much better device. irtechneo In your​ opinion that may be true. Not in mine. I honestly don't like anything about the pixel hardware..I think it is one of the ugliest phones I have ever seen. The software experience can't be beat but that isn't all I factor into my purchasing decisions. Michael Hannigan You are right when you say that the overall experience cannot be beat. Michael Hannigan Ouch, ouch! shamatuu I can buy a laptop with that price longer with 769 bucks Cowboydroid You could get a used Pixel laptop for about half that price. Mix My laptop with a GTX 1050, 8gb of ram and an i7 quad core processor was cheaper than my 128gb PIxel XL, Canadian............. Never again. TechGuy22 So expensive Thanks to my 6p I got to buy the xl 128 gb only for 300 bucks. Kyle Null If you don't NEED a phone right now, you really shouldn't​ buy the Pixel. Wait for the Pixel 2 or something better. EowynCarter Yeah, I think that even if google where to finally make the pixel available in France, I would wait. I just hope google get their act together and actually do a worldwide release and my nexus 6 don't suffer some sudden death. Tk JunkMail My Nexus 6 is running Android 7 and Google Fi and is as fast as ever. No reason to replace it. EowynCarter Mine sometimes get laggy. Plus, no Android O. :( That's a shame. Michael Hannigan Google, like the rest of the world, really doesn't care about France. Sean O’Connor Problem is that waiting is what got me into this situation in the first place. I didn't buy a 6P last summer since the Pixel​ was around the corner, and I've only started seeing the model I want available within the past few weeks. I could wait again, but by the time I'm lucky enough to see the Pixel 2 I want in stock on the play store people will be talking about the Pixel 3. There is always some better device to wait for, but at a certain point I just need to get a new phone. Kyle Null I'm​ still using the Nexus 5 because I'm waiting for Google to release a reasonably priced device. At this rate, I might still be using the Nexus 5 in 2030. Vinayak Prabhu I was in the same boat, but finally jumped on to the S8+ Michael Hannigan Ouch! Andy I was in same boat. I ended up getting a moto z play. Its amazing for the price. I'll get the pixel 2 in the fall. Michael Hannigan It's a piece of crap, but a good piece of crap for the price. You seem to be one of the few reasonable peeps here. Michael Hannigan True dat, hookah. You hit da nail on da head. Tk JunkMail The Nexus 6 is running Android 7 and Google Fi and is as fast as ever. No reason to replace it. Cowboydroid My Nexus 6 was slow even on marshmallow. It was almost unusable on 7. Had to root and revert back. john gregson No more Google. 6P very poor for a person who deals with emotionally distressed clients. 8 hours maximum juice. Michael Hannigan Maybe you need to get better clients. Duder12 That shit battery life was a Qualcomm issue not a Google issue. Michael Hannigan You should have done a factory reset. That would have fixed it. Cowboydroid I did multiple resets. Michael Hannigan Ok, finally! Good. It's probably all set, then. You're welcome. Cowboydroid Mmmmm. Michael Hannigan But the Nexus 6 was/is a great phone. One of the best, if not the best, Nexus made. Alex Higgins The clear cases should have been free from the outset... Broke in me 3 months in. I'd pass on even the free one and opt for an awesome one on Amazon for half the price. Can't vouch for the silicone ones. Michael Hannigan "...pass on the free one"? Didn't think about that too long before blurting it out, did you? Alex Higgins Didn't have to. Had one, wasn't worth $30, isn't worth having even if it's free. Phone's great, though. Michael Hannigan That doesn't make sense. Alex Higgins Obviously, given the rest of your comments, you're offended by anyone with an opinion different from yours. So, in the interest of offending you further, I'll reply again. It makes sense if I want my phone to be protected. That clear case actually scratched my phone on the corners. So, yeah. Makes plenty of sense to me. Free != Good. Michael Hannigan I'm afraid you have overestimated my concern. Nothing in a comment section an online forum could offend me. I can't really be offended by people who don't know me. But to be realistic, I would suggest you just accept the free gift - since refusing it would either mean not getting your phone at all or delaying your shipment while you try to explain how you want it shipped in a special way from everyone else - without the free case. Idiotic. I guess I am a little offended by your stupidity, but not in a personal way. Bobby R. Blair Don't be offended by stupidity. Stupid can't be fixed. One of my pet peaves is ignorance. Ignorance is a choice. Now that does offend me. jamaniek LOL, 769$ still. Google is ridiculous with the pricing. M6 That's not ridiculous. If they have such limited stock and can't keep up with existing orders (granted that's their fault, they're missing out on a lot of demand), why drop the price? It would be ridiculous to drop the price at this point before they can at least fulfill existing orders jamaniek Considering people that already placed their orders and didn't receive them yet- yes I see your point and I agree. But other than that the price is way too high by today's standards. We've got better and faster phones at that price and as fast ones at lower prices. Pixel is probably still one of the best phones (if not the best) when it comes to pure user experience, but I don't think that this factor alone justifies spending this much on it. Richard Gozinya I dont think its that ridicules when its put in context, How much is a Iphone 7, a Samsung S7 edge, S8+ all about the same jamaniek iPhone 7 Plus costs 718$ on Amazon for 128GB option, S7 Edge costs 515$ and OP3T goes for 439$. S8+ is a completely different story, as it is a new, faster phone. May be overpriced, but still... Bruce It was ridiculously overpriced when it launched. Today it's laughable. Google wants to charge Apple prices without the associated services. Apple supports their phones for 4-5 years. Google guarantees OS updates for 18 months. Apple has stores you can walk in and get any problems fixed. Google finger points and doesn't accept blame with all the hardware problems. On a hardware level, the iPhones themselves have far fewer problems. Even if Google were to acknowledge a hardware problem, it doesn't have enough phones in stock to offer a replacement. One could simply swap out a problematic iPhone in a store. I would never buy an iPhone, but Apple service is deservedly legendary. I know anyone can have isolated anecdotes on either side, but I doubt anyone can argue about Apple's service. If I have to buy a used XL, I have no idea if the phone has a problem with the speaker or Bluetooth or call volume. Guess what that does the resale value. Google has got a long way to go before they should even dare to charge $870 for a 128GB XL. The Nexus 6P and the Nexus 5 were priced appropriately for the service provided by Google. Anything over $500, is overpriced for a phone from Google. Duder12 How do you not get that it was a marketing move? The price says it's competition to the iPhone. Had they launched the pixel 1 at a lower price it would have never recovered. Duder12 You don't. We do. Elsiedamado Google is paying 97$ per hour! Work for few hours & have longer with friends and family! !sg84c: On tuesday I got a great new Land Rover Range Rover from having earned $8752 this last four weeks.. Its the most-financialy rewarding I've had..

Cai Copley The price is crazy because due it's bland design, lack of innovation, lack of customer service, the fact updates may not extend beyond two years, no stores to buy from. Apple charges those prices because of the customer service, constant updates for 4+ years, etc so they have the cash flux to provide for that—people would rather pay a one time high price than continually pay a subscription service! Michael Hannigan I would rather continually pay for a subscription service, assuming it carries a substantial value. charlie Jason That case makes it look even more like an iPhone. Just saying. NooSH should be [Rape alert]* Margaritas Ante Porcos Is it obligatory here to say only nice things about that crap of a phone? because I have nothing but a middle finger to to this ugly overpriced underachiever. Gerardo Sarabia I don't love the design and it's far from perfect but it's still the best phone I've ever used. Michael Hannigan So you weren't able to get on, were you? Duder12 Best phone I've ever owned. putte40 If that phone could be available worldwide.... Marty Meh...I'd rather have either a Spigen or Supcase. Cowboydroid Both are massively overpriced. I'm curious to see sales stats. Me Are the cases backordered as well? matteventu Nobody wants their crappy cases. ro964 I entertained a Pixel XL purchase at one point, but never ever found stock available, save for one brief moment while speaking directly with a Project Fi customer service rep. Over time, my interest has evaporated. Today I'm using a Nexus 5X ($249) which is running Android 7.1.2 and costs me about $35/month on Project Fi. I'll take a look at the Pixel 2 whenever it's announced. If the features are what I'm looking for, maybe my interest will be renewed. For now, I'm happy with my N5X. seattle tech HAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHA RXG9 Google still charing $769? lol. I just got 2 Galaxy S8's for $750. (T-Mobile BOGO deal) Michael Hannigan Read the fine print, chump! Duder12 No kidding. Dumbass just locked himself into TMobile Luiz Marin After I got one for $15 on eBay to my pixel, I just in love with the silicone touch of it, Totally worth it Mako10 Google should stick to software, both of my nexus phones have been a joke. And with all the complaints about the pixel, they still cant get it right...and for $800 no less. Sorry but my next phone will either be a S8 or Note, or more likely an iphone. never thought id say the "i" word, but their stuff just works. Michael Hannigan It's been "a couple of months since the Pixel and Pixel XL debited"? Really? For me it's been over six months. LethalLunatic Probably does not understand the definition of "couple" Mark Conroy It's never even appeared on the Play store in Ireland, so no danger of it being overpriced in a country where Google have an enormous financial presence. Lindsay Meyer I have a Pixel, which was fortunately (or unfortunately) rather easy for me to acquire. But after reading about everyone who's been wanting one and can't get it, I would really like to say... Please, take mine. I would love my $800 back so I could go buy the Nexus 6 and spend the remaining 300 bucks on something else. Lots of cool stuff out there for $300. My husband has the Nexus 6, and let me tell you, it's very nearly the same damn phone as far as user experience is concerned. The Pixel is maybe like a $50 upgrade; I wouldn't pay more. Please don't let scarcity be the reason to try and get your hands on the Pixel, free case or not. You've been warned. Mix Petty much this! My wifes ZTE Axon 7 was 1/2 the price and has had less issues than my Pixel XL's have (I am on my 3rd one) My brother has had his Pixel XL for less than 4 months and he is already selling it. Not worth $1,340 CAD....not even close. Duder12 Yeah well same can't be said with last year's Nexus 6p and Nexus 5x. The Qualcomm processor in those phones make them an immediate no compared to the pixel. Fred #destocking Mix I have heard that these cases are utter garbage and $10 cases from Amazon are better quality. These are, apparently, super brittle and crack easily..... I would just wait as this isn't really a good deal.

Netflix confirms it is blocking rooted/unlocked devices, app itself is still working (for now) Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/13 3:08pm PDTMay 13, 2017 229 Plus 1 on G+ 1077 Share on Facebook 394 Share on Twitter Total Shares1700 Applications News Earlier today, Netflix started showing up as 'incompatible' on the Play Store for rooted and unlocked Android devices. However, the app itself continued to work fine, leading some (including myself) to think it could have been an accident. However, Netflix has now confirmed to us that blocking modified devices from downloading the app was intentional. This is the full statement: With our latest 5.0 release, we now fully rely on the Widevine DRM provided by Google; therefore, many devices that are not Google-certified or have been altered will no longer work with our latest app and those users will no longer see the Netflix app in the Play Store. If you're not familiar with it, Widevine is a Google-made DRM technology that works across various desktop and mobile platforms. Widevine categorizes devices into three security levels, ranging from all processes running in the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) to not running anything in TEE at all. However, the Play Store listing seems tied to a device's SaftetyNet status (which is used by Android Pay), rather than the Widevine TEE. For example, Artem's bootloader-unlocked stock Pixel is still on Widevine Level 1, the most secure level, but fails SafetyNet because it is unlocked. The update's changelog also confirms the: "Version 5.0 only works with devices that are certified by Google and meet all Android requirements." What isn't exactly clear is why only the Play store listing is blocked, but the app itself continued to function normally. I tried both Netflix 4.16 and 5.0.4 (the latest version, from today), and both worked without problems on my unlocked and rooted Galaxy Tab S (which is labeled as Widevine Security Level 3). Maybe at some point the app will stop working, but that does not appear to be the case right now. If you have a blocked device, I recommend following the Pushbullet channel for Netflix on APKMirror (click the Pushbullet button on that page) so you can continue to receive updates outside the Play Store.

First the vpn's now this... why oh why??? Jimk4003 Surely because licensing is regionally specific, and because rooting has the potential to defeat DRM. I get that it might be annoying for some people, but aren't the reasons obvious? David Juarez But root?? Lol Semianonymous Probably an effort to reduce Region spoofing? Idk how easy that is to do on a stock device. Jimk4003 Because rooting has the potential to defeat DRM. mjh49783ab DRM doesn't work. All DRM does is inconvenience the end user. Jimk4003 Possibly. But Netflix have to negotiate licencing deals with the movie studios, and having DRM helps reassure the studios that the movies they have spent millions of dollars making aren't going to get stolen off Netflix without any attempt to stop it. mjh49783ab One could make the argument that rooting the phone may compromise the DRM. But blocking users from unlocking their phones to switch carriers? That is total bullshit, and is just the sort of thing that encourages users to pirate the content. Jimk4003 Netflix are blocking you from switching carriers? lomsha Sim unlocked phones are fine, unlocked bootloaders are blocked. mjh49783ab They didn't exactly make that clear in the article when I last read it. h4rr4r The studios need to reconsider blu rays then. Way easier to rip. Nothing they do will stop piracy. This kind of thing actually encourages it. Jimk4003 Maybe studios do need to consider Blu-ray's. That isn't Netflix's problem though. h4rr4r No Netflix problem is making sure they don't let the studios reduce the value of their product. If Amazon video works on my devices and Netflix does not that is a big deal to me. In that case I might as well sign up for more addon channels on Amazon with the mkney that currently goes to Netflix. Jimk4003 Agreed. But the studios are responsible for making the product they redistribute. It's certainly a balancing act, and I can see both sides of the argument, but Netflix isn't an inalienable right, and those who don't meet the T&C's are going to miss out. h4rr4r Sure, but the studios and Netflix are going to create pirates with these kind of actions. People aren't going to miss out. They will just pirate what they can't get legally. Jimk4003 Sure, but again, it's a tiny fraction of users. If Netflix can negotiate better terms with studios by blocking rooted devices, and thus improve their business overall at the expense of a few fringe users, it stands to reason that is what Netflix will do. Doby Gillis whaa fucking whaa. Sergio Carmona The only obvious thing here is your sarcasm detector not working properly. Go have it fixed please. Jimk4003 Nah, I'm good. h4rr4r So the reason are to make the product worse for the consumer. Great idea, now piracy looks better and better. Jimk4003 What percentage of phones are rooted though? Most people won't care, or even notice the change. h4rr4r It does not matter, if it drives even one person to piracy that is a loss. Jimk4003 But if they can ensure better licensing deals via these new terms, which will attract more customers at the expense of a few rooted users who make up a tiny fraction of overall users; will Netflix care about that loss? h4rr4r But if it encourages piracy the other side of the contract should want to avoid it. Gaining customers in the short term like this hurts the whole market in the long term. Cyber_Akuma Because yeah, people are going to rip movies from Netflix and not off a Blu-Ray.... and even IF they were to attempt to rip them off Netflix, they would use a PHONE and not a PC.... Jimk4003 Ripping Blu-rays isn't Netflix's problem, and Netflix don't need to try and guess what device someone would try and commit piracy with, when the technology exists to restrict them all. Cyber_Akuma You are missing the point, people aren't going to be ripping from Netflix over ripping from a Blu-Ray, and on top of that, they sure as hell aren't going to be ripping off a phone. And actually, you are wrong, the technology to "resist them all" does NOT actually exist. There is no one technology that "restricts them all" but several different technologies for different platforms with various levels of viability and success. Jimk4003 I said 'the technology exists'. When did I say it was a single piece of technology? Let's not be those guys who get in a pedantic argument about semantics on the internet. Regarding the issue under discussion; Netflix's job is to make their platform as robust as possible against piracy, using whatever technology is available to them. Blu-Ray simply isn't their problem. Cyber_Akuma Because just arguing "technology exists" is worthless, plenty of technology exists, and plenty of it is misused. Technically the technology to remotely brick your phone exists too, doesn't mean it's fine to use just because it "exists". And no, their platform already is robust, you are trying to ignore the fact that people ripping movies off a phone is a complete and total non-issue just to try to argue for Netflix's sake, this is ESPECIALLY considering the fact that it harms far more legitimate people than it helps. Sorry, but no, just a plain and completely undesputable NO. You can't argue that it's ok to use something that will hurt a large majority of people just to potentially possibly stop an extreme minority of people who would not even use this method anyway. That's like arguing it's ok to burn down a house to kill a spider. Jimk4003 "You can't argue that it's ok to use something that will hurt a large majority of people". We're talking about Netflix blocking rooted users; in what reality do they constitute the 'large majority' of Android users? Cyber_Akuma I meant the majority of the rooted users. Last time I checked, over 25% of people with an Android device had root access, which is several million users. And OF those several million rooted users, how many do you think actually use their rooted phone and Netflix app to pirate content? Less than 1% Hell, less than 0.1%? They are hurting over 99% of rooted Android users, which while not the majority of Android users is still a lot, to attempt to stop (and not even that effectively as there have been work-around for SafetyNet checks for nearly a year now) an extreme minority OF a minority from doing something they are unlikely to do due to other methods anyway. Richard Markert >I meant the majority of the rooted users. Even the majority of rooted users is a drop in the ocean when it comes to Android users worldwide. Cyber_Akuma Again, over 25%. You also completely missed the point of the argument in that this hurts nearly all rooted users that would not use this maliciously. Lord Argyris Looks like I'll have to start updating manually then. Or just not bother with the app at all since I rarely use Netflix on my phone as it is. SpasilliumNexus Thank goodness the 3T's Open Beta of OxygenOS is good enough for me to not unlock my device and stick with complete stock. Now I wonder why I haven't received any Netflix app updates beyond 4.16.1 build 15145 on the Play Store, when APKMirror has 4 newer versions. ast00 They asked for it. Now pirate their content knowing that you tried doing it the legal way, but THEY declined. Φώτης Because unlocking your Android powered device is such a "bad" thing to do. Whatever Netflix.

EowynCarter Yeah me too. And unless they change this, bye netflix account. No point in something I can't use anymore. Demoncat The funny part about video DRM is it's easily defeated. It's more convenient to steal the videos than to deal with the DRM restrictions. Fedup Exactly. Between VPN'ed torrents and nzbs, my Sonarr downloads all TV shows (netflix, HBO, ABC/CBS/NBC/FOX) automatically within minutes of them being ripped and posted by others. It is 100% automated, and with my Plex server running, I can watch shows anywhere - cost = $0.00. I don't do this to save money. I do it for the convenience, lack of ads, and freedom of time/place shifting. Heck, some shows actually download BEFORE they air on network TV (i.e. Designated Survivor). stan dex 97 new dark web premium links . also included are netfix lifetime membership links as well as graphic Live chat links (use anonymously) https://satoshibox.com/axbr7vnm6ifzk8hwtcreoe28/buy d0x360 I cancelled​ my account, sent them feedback and then just asked a friend who I let use HBO go and a Chromecast ultra if I could use their Netflix. David Gabel That seems rather dumb. Why cancel your service to them yet still use it via someone else? You're not teaching them anything. For an example, let's say you have a MacBook, and Apple does something to piss you off. You sell your MacBook, but then borrow a friend's MacBook. Nothing was actually accomplished. d0x360 Nothing was accomplished? I cancelled my account and let them know why. Now they aren't making money off me but I still to use their service. Your analogy is deeply flawed...deeply. So deeply I don't think you understand exactly what an analogy is. David Gabel So, you're "not giving them money" yet you still support them by using their product. It still seems like your logic is flawed. If you're really that pissed at Netflix, don't use it. Period. Use a different service instead of supporting them by borrowing it off a friend, as they are also giving them money (and support) , too via their subscription. revbones How is using their service for free "supporting" them? They aren't getting any revenue off you if you're not paying them. Saying you're supporting them by not paying them is a little stupid don't you think? xyz lol. So by your "logic" a person who pirates House of Cards is also supporting Netflix ? BobButtons You're doing the opposite of supporting. You're getting the benefits of their service while stopping payment and adding to server load which they pay for. David Gabel So far, your stance is the only one that makes sense. The rest so far are noise Sir Doogie Houser M.D.Esq. 200 You seen like an incredulous douch who I'd suplex onto a park bench for being a lap dog bitch.How is canceling or stealing not doing something.Also,its not a fucking macbook jerkoff its a paid service for TV on a phone they expect to be paid for.BTFO nagi Just another step that makes pirating the same content more convenient... we should really be going the other way if they ever want piracy to be reduced. lomsha Funny thing is their content is available to stream all over the internet. Don't see how this move fights piracy as long as computers have access. This just alienates legit users who are doing nothing nefarious on unlocked/rooted devices. Richard Branches By one everybody pays... Pathum Addarapathirana Dude I root my phone to just get iPhone emojis and to tether without my carrier knowing. Like I'm not stealing anything this will just make me stop paying for Netflix. Latheryin Just a heads up. Those treating hiding mods are fake. There is no way to hide if from the carrier. Heck if they wanted to they could see every web page you load from a ton of different places and ways. Yan Minari That’s why god invented VPN Latheryin Yes but even then it doesn't block everything. qqqqqq My provider absolutely blocks tethering - I've been using various methods, including VPNs, to block it for literally YEARS... Hasn't been difficult. Dylan Harris That's not true. All you have to due to bypass tethering limits on t-mobile is to change the TTL on the tethered device. Latheryin That just gets by the automated checks. Get a live person to randomly pick your account (not really likely but happens) and it is not had to tell if someone is tethering. Dmitri Smirnov All that person will be able to tell is whether customer is using a lot of data or not. And this is the root of the problem: be honest that you are limited traffic, instead of trying to play this game of "we'll pretent we are giving you unlimited data and in return you'll only use small-format mobile device, so that we'll hope that you won't be able to use as much of it". Kind of "all you can eat, but you have to only use a tea cup and one chopstick". Latheryin No the issue is people being entitled and taking advantage of things. You have people running their gaming systems and using hundreds of gb a month. Not only is that kinda dumb but it violate the fair use act in most cell TOS. If people didn't abuse the system then it wouldn't be an issue. Also just some food for thought. If they can't tell anything more then a lot of data just how do they route the traffic properly? Make no mistake. If the carrier wanted to they could tell. I know for a fact that there is a team for both att and Verizon that is tasked with just that. Dmitri Smirnov >No the issue is people being entitled and taking advantage of things. You have people running their gaming systems and using hundreds of gb a month. "taking advantage" I thought that people were in their right by using what they paid for. Allright, tell me this - is it allright for me to watch 4K video on my phone (since the screens allow it now)? What's the difference between this and me watching the same stream on my laptop over my phone's connection? What if I just redirect the video stream to my TV using WiDi or any other technology? How is browsing a site from a laptop different from browsing it from a phone network-congestion-wise? And then it boils down to the same argument - carriers are just hoping you'll use the network less from you phone device, as it's less convenient. The more convenient smartphones become for consuming large volumes of traffic, the sooner carriers will have to more away from this scan and expose the actual numbers. > If people didn't abuse the system then it wouldn't be an issue. If carriers would be honest and upfront about "hidden" caps, then people would not be able to game the system. > Also just some food for thought. If they can't tell anything more then a lot of data just how do they route the traffic properly? Make no mistake. If the carrier wanted to they could tell. Latheryin Tethering was never even an extra charge until people started taking advantage of the mobile networks. Watching 4k videos is not a big deal, using 200gb of mobile data in a cycle is flat out stupid. Mobile networks were not designed for that type of traffic from a single device. Nor was it made to handle running your ps4 while you are gaming. Why do you think that pages are made to be mobile friendly? Not only is it a usability issue but a data usage issue as well. It's not hidden. All people have to do is read the TOS. It's all right there. Yet most people just don't want to take the time to do it and then get made about it. Can't blame the carriers for that. Dmitri Smirnov > Watching 4k videos is not a big deal, using 200gb of mobile data in a cycle is flat out stupid. a) I'm glad we're finally on the same page that the real problem for networks is data usage and not tethering or no tethering. b) You are aware that you're contradicting yourself in the same sensense? 4K 60Fps video bitrate is ~20-40 MiB/s which gives an average movie the size of about 72GiB. so by your definition watching a movie in good quality is OK as long as you don't watch more than 3 of them in a month. c) how is using mobile data that you paid for - stupid? If there are caps - announce them and make it impossible to go over them instead of shaming people who actually decide to take you up on your offer. d) tethering has not been an extra charge until telcos understood that they could charge extra for it (just like them toying with idea of charging extra for Instant Messenger traffic, because it undercuts their SMS plans). > It's not hidden. All people have to do is read the TOS. It's all right there. Yet most people just don't want to take the time to do it and then get made about it. Can't blame the carriers for that. Well, carriers are the ones calling their plans "unlimited" and hiding the actual caps either buried deep in the ToS or behind the vague "reasonable usage". So don't blame people for not wanting to wade through pages of legalspeak just to learn that you lied and "unlmited" is just "50Gb and then throttled". Fedup Agreed. The problem is the AMOUNT of data consumed by a given user account - no how it is consumed. If carriers are concerned about individuals abusing their network, then they need to flag those accounts that use an excessive amount of bandwidth - whether it's through tethering or directly on the device itself. I could easily burn through 150GB/mo on my TMO Note 4 w/o tethering simply by leaving my Blue Iris app connected and streaming 24/7. So it's actually very easy to abuse the system without ever turning on the tethering. Android Developer Is the tether solution needed even if you do it using USB ? Fulbring What a stupid move. I pay for the premium for Netflix and I never thought that I might have to cancel my service just because they did this. The only reason why I have root is because of AdAway and TitaniumBackup. I still use the stock OnePlus 3T ROM. Wasn't expecting this at all.... Kinda suck. Will be interesting to see how many customers they lose. Julian Berger Not enough to change it back... 4Ui812 DRM has no place in our lives. I suspect Netflix will have a change of heart within 6 months. Branko Xiaomi phones say bye bye to Netflix. Google go fuck yourselves. Steve_Jobroni Go fucking buy a windows phone. 天地人 Seriously though Windows phones are great. The only problem with them is the lack of applications. Otherwise, it runs great on low-end hardware, has a great UI, the homescreen is innovative, synchronisation with Windows PCs is cool, etc. dukaki Don't forget that you can use the Netflix website on Edge instead of their shitty app, and it streams at full 1080p, even on my L650 with a 720p screen. 天地人 Wait the Netflix application hasn't an option to stream at FHD? dukaki Nope, just 480p like on android. The device has to be "certified" and there are no certified windows phones afaik. The WP app doesn't even have downloads yet, I think. Edit: Just checked, no option to download here but you can on the desktop app. EowynCarter Might end with a visit at the apple store in my case. Windows phone is kind of not supported anymore. Jimk4003 This is Netflix, not Google. Cyber_Akuma Google invented this SafetyNet crap, let anyone use it for any reason (Hell, Pokemon GO of all things started using it), and over the last year have been making it even more and more strict and unforgiving. So no, a HUGE part of the blame does lie on Google for being openly hostile towards rooted users and not giving a damn about them. Jimk4003 There are legitimate reasons to use Safetynet to check the integrity of a device: Android Pay (or banking apps in general) is one example. It isn't necessarily hostility to root users; it's just a reality that Google need to be able to demonstrate to banks or other third parties that their OS is secure, and that people can't bypass built in security safeguards. Netflix need to do the same with the studios they redistribute content for; and they've chosen to use Safetynet to do it. Netflix isn't a human right; you have no inalienable right to root your phone and to use Netflix. Cyber_Akuma Except that not even my own banking app uses SafetyNet, it still has root checking and certain sensitive features are disabled if I am rooted, but not the entire app. Furthermore, it IS hostility to rooted users, because anyone can toss SafetyNet into their app for any reason whatsoever (such as games using it "just because" in case of cheaters... which doesn't even help at all to stop them). Google has been completely unwilling to work out ANY sort of compromise or method that can keep a phone secure without basically tossing rooted users under the bus. Jimk4003 What sort of compromise do you envision? Cyber_Akuma I am saying that they didn't even try. PCs by default obviously allow admin accounts all the time, even as the main user account (as much as that is not recommended) yet can maintain security. Google when they were confronted with people who were hurt by SafetyNet, legitimate users mind you, basically just shrugged them off and didn't even bother considering what could be done to allow the device to remain secure while also having such safeties in place. I mean, all these apps that you can use on your phone, can also be used on a PC, many of them available in either a browser or native app format, yet it remains secure. There is no reason this could not be done with Android, especially considering it used Linux as a base, they are just refusing to even consider it. Jimk4003 Don't you already have that choice? Your phone is sold without root access (i.e. no admin rights), and you can then choose whether or not to root your device and gain elevated privileges. If you do choose to root your device, you will lose access to some Safetynet enabled applications. You can, of course, unroot if necessary. Cyber_Akuma First of all, not all phones are. Especially in non-US countries. Second, it shouldn't have to be a choice. How many PC apps refuse to run under an admin account? Practically none. I shouldn't have to choose between having root access or being able to use a apps that more and more are starting to add this nonsense to them. Third, it's not even just root, even having an unlocked BOOTLOADER now, even if your rom is 100% stock and unrooted, can trip SafetyNet, it didn't used to be that strict. It's ridiculous to claim one should be able to have one or the other, even SafetyNet could have been designed to not be this brokenly strict, but Google had no interest in doing so, and they are rapidly making having root more and more useless while we still have to deal with all the junk they force on your phone from the manufacturer... that you can only remove with root. Jimk4003 Well, it is what it is. You believe you shouldn't have to make a choice, whereas I believe life is all about making choices and living with the outcomes. We seldom get everything we want, and neither Netflix, nor rooting, are inalienable rights. Whether or not you think it should be a choice, it is one; choose what you feel is best for you. Cyber_Akuma That's not even an argument, that's just trying to claim that the status quo should remain for no reason other than it is the status quo. It shouldn't have to be a choice, and arguing that people have to choose between root and having an increasingly less amount of apps just because "it is what it is" is insanity. In fact, it wasn't even the status quo before until Google started pulling this nonsense with SafetyNet a short while ago. That doesn't mean people should just accept it. Jimk4003 It's not an argument, because there is no argument to be had. The reality of the situation is self-evident; you can't have a rooted device and install Netflix via Google Play. Accepting the status quo has nothing to do with it; it's simply acknowledging reality. You have to choose what's more important to you; Netflix or rooting your phone. Finding the reality frustrating, as you clearly do, won't make it any less real. If this was a serious discussion on human rights; censorship, migration, justice, gender equality etc., then it's important in a democracy to be aware of your rights and responsibilities, and challenge the status quo where necessary. But this isn't anything like that. This is two for-profit corporations, Google and Netflix, who provide services to which you have no fundamental right to access, nor any obligation to use. You can choose to pay for their services and accept their terms and conditions, or you can choose not to. You don't get to pick the terms and conditions of the service someone else is providing you; however you are free to not use the service if you don't like the terms and conditions under which they are provided. That's it; it's no simpler or more complicated than that. Ranting on the internet about how unfair you perceive it to be is irrelevant. Again, it is what it is. Cyber_Akuma Again, there is no "it is what it is" argument. There should be no choice, PERIOD. You are basically saying that people should not complain about this just because "it is what it is". No, it is NOT what it is, it should NOT BE what it is, and people can and WILL complain that it SHOULD NOT be what it is. You aren't even making any rational arguments anymore, just re-stating what the current situation is and then basically claiming that people should not want or expect better. Jimk4003 You can want or expect better if you like. Netflix, like every other for-profit enterprise in a capitalist system, will either succeed or fail based on its ability to turn a profit. Right now, Netflix is turning a profit, and clearly thinks it can be more profitable by excluding rooted users whose theoretical ability to circumvent DRM restrictions may impact its ability to secure rights to new content. Clearly you disagree with their stance, and the only way to see for sure if your disagreement is warranted is to watch their financial performance from here on out. None of the above changes the fact that you aren't entitled to Netflix. You've chosen to root your phone, and Netflix have recently chosen to exclude rooted users. That leaves you with a choice to make. Even if you think that choice is unfair, even if you think you should be able to have both. The reality is you can't have both, and you will have to choose. Again, Netflix isn't a right. Go elsewhere if you disagree with their business practices; that's how capitalism works. Beyond that, you're just having a spat with reality; and that's a tough fight to win ;) Cyber_Akuma Actually, what do you think would lose them more profits, the theoretical minority OF a minority that MIGHT rip movies on their phones (which still requires a Netflix account in the first place) or blocking that 25% minority? Also, drop this "right" nonsense. No, seriously, drop it right now. People are paying for a Netflix account, they DO have a right to get the service they paid for. Netflix made zero warning or mention of this impending block, they pulled it out of nowhere for paying customers. So sorry, but they DO have a right to the service, since they are paying for it. Sony was found to be legally in the wrong when they removed the OtherOS feature from the PS3, because why? Because people PAID for the console when it had that feature, they DID have a right to what they paid for. You're just having a spat with arguing for argument's sake when you don't even have an argument. Jimk4003 There is no argument; it's the reality of the situation. Netflix have implemented DRM controls that block access to the Netflix app via the Play Store on rooted devices. I do understand why Netflix want to tighten their DRM procedures, and I do understand why some people have been left frustrated by this change. The reality is, however, if you want to download the Netflix app via Google Play, you will need an un-rooted phone; such as the phones used by the majority of Android users. That's all that's happening. I get that you don't like it. But stamping your foot and shouting 'no fair, no fair' achieves nothing. Netflix are entitled to run their business how they see fit within the law; and consumers get to choose whether they want to give Netflix their business or not. That's all there is to it. Don't like the way Netflix do business; don't give Netflix your money. Cyber_Akuma All you are doing with the "it is what it is" argument is just repeating what the article is saying. That is not conductive to anything. Anyone who has read the article knows what is happening right now. And sorry, but you are doing the same stamping your foot with the "well, it is what it is" argument. Not to mention that you are also wrong, because over the last 5 or so years ALONE there have been dozens of examples of consumers speaking out against policies or DRM and the companies begin forced to reverse it from the backlash. So you are doing nothing but hurting legitimate users by trying to argue "it is what it is". And again, no, they are not entitled to run their business in a way that without warning locks customers out of what they paid for, Sony tried this... and got in legal trouble and lost. So sorry, but you are wrong, and you have been nothing but wrong this entire argument. Netflix isn't' "entitled" to do this, people DO have a reason to complain, there IS a reason to complain, complaining HAS changed such practices before, and all you are doing is further hurting legitimate users by attempting to insist the "it is what it is" non-argument. Your entire argument has been fundamentally wrong from the start. Jimk4003 It's not my argument; it's simply Netflix's position. I get you don't agree with it, but it's totally valid for Netflix to wish to strengthen their DRM procedures. You do know I'm not responsible for Netflix's decision making, right? It is what it is; I wouldn't get too upset about it. Cyber_Akuma Again, "it is what it is" is not a valid argument. Jimk4003 No it's not an argument. Again, there is no argument necessary; the reality of the situation is self-evident, and no amount of arguing here will change it. The fact is this; YOU rooted your phone. You weren't forced. You should have known that by rooting your phone you are modifying the device beyond its factory specification. You should have known that this essentially makes you responsible for the proper operation of the device; you no longer have the device manufacturer or Google to turn to when software that you have modified doesn't work as expected. You should also have known that rooting prevents a device from complying with the compatibility test suite, and that this can affect your devices ability to function correctly. You should have been aware of the SafetyNet API, and anticipated the fact that this API would be adopted more and more broadly as Google promoted its usage. You can't blame Google for this; as before, once you modify your device beyond its factory spec, you're responsible for supporting yourself. Rooting a device is at the owners risk. You've now found yourself in a situation where a modification you have made to your device prevents you from accessing a service you want to use. That's on you; no-one made you modify your device, no-one said they would take responsibility for the changes you have made to your device, and rooted users are expected to assume liability for any ramifications and complications they face as a result of their decision to modifying their device. Netflix are well within their rights to enforce DRM on their product by using the SafetyNet API provided by Google, and the Google documentation clearly states rooted devices will fail the CTS check. This documentation is publicly available. You went ahead and rooted your device anyway. That's on you. It's no-one elses job to make sense of the decisions you have taken. You're free to carry on using Netflix if you return your device to a state where the integrity of the device can be verified. Or you're free to carry on using a rooted device and living with the compromises that entails. Your choice. Cyber_Akuma I don't think you get it. All you are doing is parroting what the article is saying. Furthermore, despite there being plenty of examples of complaining doing EXACTLY what you claim it cannot do, that is to change such decisions, you keep repeating that "complaining will do nothing". You are a broken record, arguing the same "it is what it is" argument over and over so you can avoid actually thinking. An argument (and yes, no matter how much YOU stomp your feet that it is not, it IS an argument) that has already been disproven over and over and over. You also ignored that there are many countries where phones are already sold rooted, or how such things don't effect using such services on a PC with admin rights which are the same thing, or the dozens of other holes in your logic large enough to sail a ship through. There is no "you should have been aware" because this is a total lapse in common sense and my device is in no way incompatible from a hardware or software level, but rather, the app is purposely rejecting it. Furthermore, they made no prior warning whatsoever. This is like arguing "you should have known modern cars could be remotely disabled" if a dealership decides to just disable all cars with an aftermarket radio installed. I don't know where to even begin with all the broken wrong logic in that last post. Why are you even here if you couldn't care less? You are free to carry on being a living example of "First they came", but don't come crying about how nobody else is listening to you because you could not possibly be any more wrong. I DO have a right to use Netflix on my device, rooted or no, if I am paying for it. If you argue against this, you are wrong. People DO have a right to root their devices, if you argue against this, you are wrong. People DO have a right (and have many many MANY times in the past) to challenge the "it is what it is" status quo, if you argue against this, you are wrong. And I know you WILL argue against this, which will mean that, see above, you are wrong. I have been more than patient with your insane thick-headnedness. At this point I can't tell if you are being willfully ignorant or really are just that ignorant. Or just trolling, that is an option as well. There is no way anyone rational at this point can continue to argue the insanity that you have argued. Jimk4003 I interpret personal insults as an indicator that the individual making them no longer has any faith in their actual arguments, and so I think it's time to call time on this particular discussion. As you've pointed out, neither of us is getting anywhere. It's been fun, but once it starts getting abusive, the fun has to stop. It's a shame, because DRM Vs individual user rights has the potential to be a really interesting discussion topic. I hope you get what you're after; and that the reality of the situation will change to be more in line with what you think it should be. Unfortunately I imagine the situation regarding DRM and rooted devices will only get more restrictive going forward. Take care. Cyber_Akuma You purposely instigate people into losing their patience with you, and then claim "I win because you got angry", especially when the anger is because you were refusing to understand the entire argument throughout this entire mess. Richard Markert Root is, by definition, unsecure. Any time you have userland processes that have access to ring0 you are inherently unsecure, as there are no restrictions placed upon running code at that point. Cyber_Akuma And yet, there are ways to run it securely on PCs. Netflix and online banking would not be available on PCs if it wasn't. TedPhillips mostly agree. by providing a turn-key 'lockdown' check, and further by ret-conning it into playstore access (let's see how far they take that) -google is now openly hostile to anyone who bought into android for it's ability to customize and truly 'own' your own device. the open source roots of android was a big differentiator vs something like iOS, but now that they have dominate market position - they are walking away from that without concern. (only worrying about how slow they need to boil the frog to get away with it) meanwhile, what middle manager is going to say 'no' to adding safetyNet checks in their app or play store listing? it is an easy way for them to write down on potential risks, unjustified (which it pretty much always is) or not. blindexecutioner So the solution is to install from outside the play store. That's great for security. Way to go. Richard Markert No they don't. Since Windows 7, new and default users are not Admin accounts. koiulpoi Sorry, this is absolutely wrong. The first user created on a Windows PC has full administrative access, limited by UAC. You can still delete System32, it's just mildly harder than it used to be. If "new and default users" were not Admin accounts, they couldn't install software, so... Richard Markert Default user accounts are higher than Limited accounts, but not as high as Admin accounts. That's why they can install software. Linux users are not admins but can still install software, right? It started on Windows 7, expanded in 8/8.1 and now in Windows 10 a user account behaves just like a user account in Linux. It has no access to %systemdir% unless you manually go in the folder properties and give your user account Admin permissions to it. You can still run things AS admin by giving the permission at runtime, but since all that requires is pressing a button (if your built-in admin account isn't passworded, which it isn't by default, one step forward two back, sigh) and most users are too "stupid" to simply not press that button. koiulpoi It's really funny when people speak authoritatively about something they're so wrong about. The first account created by the Windows OOBE is automatically added to the Administrators group. This means they're an Administrator. They have Administrative privileges. The fact that certain actions are blocked until you click "yes" on a simple UAC prompt doesn't stop this; they're in "Admin Approval Mode", which can be disabled via GPO if you care to. If you buy a computer from Dell (example), set it up, then go to System32 and start deleting .dll files, it'll ask for administrative privileges, but you can click yes and away it goes! Some files are protected at "SYSTEM" level, which is higher than administrator, but DEFAULT USERS ARE ADMINISTRATORS. This has ABSOLUTELY nothing to do with the "password" on the built-in "Administrator" account. That account is disabled out-of-the-box. Please, you're digging a bigger hole trying to look "right". How to prove this: Set up a new computer. Set up user default for MS. Start -> Run -> netplwiz -> Be amazed that your user is part of the group "Administrators". TechGuy22 Haha kodi Doesn't matter to me I Stopped paying for Netflix long time ago. C64 Haha Teranium TV 😎 TechGuy22 I like that too. You can even get the mod one and remove the ads. Lol C64 I know, i always use those. I want to pay for the dev, but there's no option to do that. Koko time is coming with a big update to tim242 Thief. Renato Santos This is stupid. Congratulations, Netflix. Jan-Lk Else It is also getting more and more necessary to unlock / root devices due to missing updates etc. But I'm not a Netflix customer and won't become one. C64 Whahaha, this has to be the most retarded move of the year in any category (even Trump can't top this). I'm glad i don't use Old Crap Flix. A Person Hillary, then Netflix. C64 Nope sorry. Since Trump is your president i can't take America serious anymore A Person Timeout, you're not even a US citizen? No interest in your opinion. James F Wow. Just wow. I can't take you seriously either if that's how you treat people. Not cool, man. A Person "Wow, just wow"? When he can vote in our elections I'll take his opinions of our elections seriously. It is highly ill-informed anyhow. Paul Sterling A person wins! Marcelove Timeout, you are a Trump supporter? No interest in your opinion (neither anyone smart in the world). Roy Riddex Just so I'm clear on this, by unlocked are we talking about SIM unlocked? lomsha No no, unlocked bootloader. Roy Riddex Thanks Corbin Davenport Unlocked bootloader. pbergonzi I wonder how long they'll stick with that premise seeing as how much public opinion expressed here is against them. Screw them. Get the APK somewhere else or install magisk and hide your root. Too many people root their devices and have a good reason for doing so and Netflix should not penalize them. Doby Gillis Dude, normal people don't give a fuck about rooted phones. It's just the elitist twats who do it anymore. twiz0r Dude, you're an elitist twat. Richard Markert Most people who root seem to be. The sentiment among rooters is "if you don't root your phone, you're not as good as me and don't deserve to have a phone. Root you stupid noob!" twiz0r thanks for confirming your twatness. good day. C64 One word ..... Bullshit Corey Kinard I've yet to see that... Maybe you just feel like that because they do in fact know more than you? Richard Markert My first version of Android was 1.5. I've seen it for many years. How long have you been in the scene? EowynCarter My phone isn't rooted. And not compatible anymore ! Franco Fassio Unlocked bootloader maybe? EowynCarter Yes. But seam I can't lock it without wipe. So screw you Netflix. Marcelove Let me guess, your profile pic is that right? https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/0f0c4f3e3ce40074aebfe58d80511d4a0b7d4a94896ce54d82e448a1cd2e3ceb.jpg bruce lancaster Dude. It isn't just rooted phones - Also unlocked. Elitists get their iphones and galaxy s8s from att and verizon. Normal people get their devices from amazon, ebay, newegg, gearbest etc. Jimk4003 I'm sure Netflix are terrified that the tiny fraction of Android users who come to this site, and the similarly tiny fraction who root their phones, are bothered. The rest of the world won't care. bruce lancaster An article in Wireless Week (cellphone industry rag) a couple of months back says it's now a majority of phones in Asia that are unlocked and Europe is getting pretty close to 50/50. US passed 30% unlocked around Christmas. People aren't getting their phones from ATT, Verizon, etc any more now that they have to pay full retail and don't get a free or heavily discounted flagship device with contract renewal. They are getting them from Amazon, Gearbest, Newegg, etc and moving their sim. If I owned stock in Netflix right now, I'd sell it quick on this news. Everything that isn't already mobile is going mobile. Alienating half the European market and 30% of the US market is asinine. Fedup Yup. Ditched my flagship Samsung phone for a 'budget' Moto G5 Plus that is 100% compatible with all four US carriers (and their dozens of MNVOs). Swapping providers is as easy as changing the sim. And despite the slower spec'ed hardware, the carrier bloat-free Nougat is WAY faster than my TW Galaxy phone - and the battery life is INSANE. C64 Probably 90 % of the people don't know what root is. Almost every person I know owns an Android device, but i'm the only geek who flashes and roots his devices bruce lancaster It isn't just rooted phones but also unlocked phones. Got your phone on amazon? Got it on ebay? Got it from gearbest? Got it from newegg? Yup. No netflix for you without jumping through enough hoops that you'll actually know about rooting by the time you get it done. Fedup Are we conflating a carrier-unlocked vs. bootloader unlocked phone? They are two distinctly different things, and I doubt that having a carrier-unlocked phone (i.e. using a TMO phone on ATT, or VZ on Sprint) has any impact on SafetyNet or Widevine. pbergonzi Judging from the posts here it looks like nobody who roots their phone uses Netflix anyway so I guess it's moot. But the outcry sure did get them a bunch of free publicity. T4rd This is what Magisk is for. Pretty sure if I can still use Android Pay with my rooted 6P, I can still use/update Netflix through the Play Store. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Magisk still requires that you unlock your bootloader, which is enough to trigger safety net these days, so that won't work. TechGuy22 You don't know how magisk works do you Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ I understand that Magisk is a great tool for modifying my system without actually modifying it. I understand that there are many modules that allow you to do things like hide root, bypass security modules, skin your system, and plenty of other things. What I don't understand is how you can install magisk without unlocking your bootloader. Back when I originally tried it out with pokemon go, it worked well for a while, but eventually even just having my bootloader unlocked was all it took to throw SafetyNet. If that's not an issue anymore, then great! But maybe say that instead of being snarky. Thomas Gladdines Bootloader can be simply locked after rooting and installing a custom recovery. Edwin O. Lol no You could, but then you can't flash anything with said recovery... So no point Thomas Gladdines LOL the recovery doesn't stop working after a bootloader is locked, only fastboot won't flash images but the recovery can do whatever it wants to, update the rom, edit system files etc. Muzzy996 Well as an example for the Google Pixel: https://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=71901761&postcount=454 In this case all it takes is a kernel that supports Magisk and hides the fact that the bootloader is unlocked, at which point with Magisk Hide enabled all root and SafetyNet checks pass. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Excellent. I'll have to look back into this then, last time I used magisk it wasn't as capable, glad to see it's come this far. sbeaulieu Magical Hide is there for that Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Can Magical Hide hide that my bootloader is unlocked? Serious question, not being sarcastic or snarky as I was below. sbeaulieu It does make the SafetyNet check pass iJeggu Magisk itself doesn't hide an unlocked bootloader it only hides root but must custom roms simply delete the verifiedbootstate -flag which in turn makes safetynet pass even with an unlocked bootloader. Some older devices don't have this flag in their kernels in the first place so safetynet will accept that the flag is missing. Link to the patch that most custom roms (kernels to be specific) have to pass safetynet: https://github.com/sultanxda/android_kernel_oneplus_msm8996/commit/abc05b16bbd33521c2fffaf491c5657a94bfcfc5 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/5b1ff3f47e32d5f57ddadcd650a5b94725bd4e6242cea92e269f51e988d0d426.png T4rd Except it's working for me right now... jonzey231 This has been happening for a week now. I tweeted it to Ruddock a few days ago. Just didn't put together that it was because I was unlocked. https://twitter.com/jonzey231/status/862122438125072384 steelew Google really needs to start stealing from the root community the way apple takes from the jailbreak community. It feels like rooting is way down except for a few (legal) use cases. If it weren't for visual tweaks & usability tweaks, I would have no need to root (personally). This kind of stuff starts to make rooting unpleasant. I already can't use fingerprint auth in my banking app any more because root. Jesús Cuenca They do. I used rooms for like 8 years maybe? And a lot of the "new features" always come of the rom or root comunity. Right now i use roms, but not root. Marcelove I'm trying to stay indoors, but is complicate... Greenify for example, works at no root devices nowadays... But is way better with root and Xposed... Doze can't compare against Greenify... Maybe at version number 20 root wouldn't be necessary... Sandeep Raghuraman What about the version downloaded from Amazon app store though? Does that work fine? TwoBit Gary It worked, but it is old version without show downloads. Go to apkmirror oculairmedia Interesting move. I flashed a custom ROM on my Nexus 6 because stock was so slow that it was getting unusable, but screw me right ? Atoqir In my country lots of stuff doesn't work on unrooted devices. My bank app, payment app and local cable TV and digicorder app all stopped working. Also s-health doesn't work anymore and soon Netflix. Time to unroot Marcelove "Time to unroot" Sheep. Richard Markert Rooting is insecure. You don't need to access the system partition except to break things. Benjamin Walburn If that were the case then this wouldn't be an issue. Nobody is looking to break their phone. Richard Markert Few people I've talked to online know what they're doing when it comes to root. Most of those end up breaking things. Rooting is far too easy and probably shouldn't exist at all. Benjamin Walburn You could say the same about anything, not just modification of phones. Maybe you shouldn't own a car if you can't fix it yourself, or have kids if you aren't a doctor. Rooting isn't easy, it's made easy by the hard work of other people. It's not up to you what other people do with their property, you have no right to say that they shouldn't. And if someone breaks their phone, what does it have to do with you? It's their hobby and their phone. You're not their daddy. senoredusty Or use Magisk DJMix No need. You could use magisk su hide for the moment. it still passes the safetynet. I too use a banking app that cannot be used on normal root proocess faceless128 "please stop giving us money and use Kodi instead" Sounds like a great business plan! JD For the sake of Kodi's developers don't say Kodi in that context. ericshmerick Hrmm, every time I hear Kodi, I think of pirated content. Guess when people are like "I use Kodi for my 30TB media collection" I stop and wonder how... Yes, ripping a lifetime of DVDs, but nah. Probably piracy. C64 I know a few how really use it legally Powsniffer0110 Yea I use it legally 95% of the time. ErectBipedal nah man, I use Kodi to browse my 30TB of linux isos. Totally legit I swear. Chazz Matthews Torrents are legal too. Just depends on the content. Mike Honestly though, if pirate add-ons wern't available on kodi, 98% of the people using it now would not have even heard of it before. Even bad publicity is good publicity. They are not going to publicly come out and say it, but the add-on's are the only reason they're well known. Andy Roid But kodi makes piracy so easy! Blian Oh god, please stop. Nobody is using Kodi for their DVD rips. Railwayman I rather say Fusion and Exodus et al instead since Kodi is... Kodi and you have to install what you want. The Netflix business plan is for her more people on Exodus, Phoenix and SALTS - not to mention Terrarium TV and MovieBox as well. Kevin Strident Kodi is open source. If Kodi stops wanting to be as useful as it is now, someone will fork it and keep it doing what its users enjoy. cbstryker Kodi is just an open source media player. To watch any pirated content you either need to download it or install an unaffiliated plugin that streams from pirated sources. C64 Next kodi wil have drm build in. So people have to use forks. I stopped using kodi since i found Teranium TV. cbstryker That makes zero sense. Kodi's reason for existing would stop. C64 That's BS my friend, Kodi (xbmc) has started on the original xbox and was made and used as a media player Justin D Same...but with Plex and something else >.> Dany Lol I know right? I was using Kodi more than Netflix anyway so... Dmitry Stepanushkin Xposed + RootCloak or something similar will do it for most of apps for those who need root. So I think not a big problem. Abhishek Saral Not a big problem but a big annoyance. tehboogieman Hmm, rootcloak isn't working for me with netflix m477 No, it won't work. Safetynet always fails if you have closed activated, or if you just have an unlocked bootloader. Sometimes even by just having adb debugging turned on. Kan☆n MagiskSU and its manager app comes with a very good hider built-in. No Xposed needed. h4rr4r Beyond pointless. Netflix won by being easier than piracy, this threatens to turn back the clock on that. Lexster These companies don't seem to get that most people pirate because it's easier/cheaper than buying what they want. Yes, it's wrong, whatever, the point is streaming services made it easier for people, which outweighed the hassle of pirating it. You're right, this kind of thing is what will get people to start doing it again more. BobButtons If I can't use Netflix on my rooted phone, it's Netflix that'll go, not the root. They're encouraging piracy. YaKillaCJ Exactly. Screw it, I only have Netflix for convenience. This will also have negative impact on many devices and average consumers even if they never unlock or root. A lot don't have Google certification, such as upcoming OEMs. Then theirs beta roms like Xiaomi and OnePlus that run awesome. Marcelove Funny thing: I was about to become a subscriber of Netflix after seeing House of Cards by PirateBay but now through the official channel because I thought that Netflix deserved my money... Look : deservED... But this movie will keep me at PirateBay... Funny thing 2: I have a Moto G5 that I could unlock and root and I didn't it just because I wanna see how things are nowadays without root... And I use a lot of apps that would work better with root (Greenify for example)... So I would be able to use Netflix... And I won't and will stay that way only because this douchebag move... Congratulations Netflix... Funny thing 3: So happy that I waited till House of Cards release to become a subscriber... Netflix should learn something from Frank Underwood... And from Blockbuster... tim242 Yeah, sure you were. Once a thief, always a thief. koiulpoi This is the most untrue statement I've read on this website. Thomas Elephants can fly 天地人 http://gadling.com/2012/06/10/airline-transports-herd-of-african-elephants-photos/ koiulpoi Nice! You matched it. 天地人 Yes, because illegally pirating from huge corperations which constantly attempt to and successfully brainwash people into agenda using various tricks, is somehow bad? You're not supporting the creators of the show, sure. But you're also not supporting the 6 Jewish companies that control 90% of American media. Anyways, with your little money you wouldn't be benefitting anybody. Do you honestly think those Jewish companies are dying to get a hold of your $120 you payed for Netflix this year? Probably not. The creators of the show, are well off anyways. Don't companies pay them to have their content on their platform and pay for their production cost and wages? Then; they've already been payed. I'm not endorsing piracy. It isn't the best thing to do, but I think calling people a "thief" and grouping them with people who have actually stolen things off individuals which mean a lot to the individual and murdered some individuals in the process, is just stupid. It's not the same as 'stealing' bits of 1s and 0s. Again, I'm not endorsing piracy, however there are a lot of good reasons to pirate movies and TV shows. Paul Sterling You're a thief. People leave their families for months to give you works of art. Games, movies, music. You can't throw them a few bucks? I'm legit, always will be. Also, tax helps everyone. Your wall of text is just trying to convince yourself, thief. 天地人 Nope. A thief is different from a pirate, besides, they've already been payed. And I was talking about TV shows and movies, but you're too dense to realise it. jj14x Not the same. If I spend time writing code for software, and decide to sell a monthly license instead of a perpetual license, that is my choice. Your choice should be to either subscribe to the monthly license, or to find a competitor software to use instead. Choosing to bypass the licensing checks makes you a thief (taking something without the owner's permission makes you a thief). And same logic applies to TV shows/movies. If you want to own the movie and watch it whenever you want it, BUY it. "illegally pirating from huge corperations which constantly attempt to and successfully brainwash people into agenda using various tricks, is somehow bad?"<-- YES - it is still illegal. Just because somebody stole your car doesn't mean you can go and steal that person's car in retaliation. There are laws and procedures on how to handle that. STDog Illegal != bad, legal != good. Thousands of unjust laws have been passed. They made actions illegal that were not bad. Richard Markert It's trickle-down, man. Think about if everybody thought like you. Netflix has 100 million subs and each pay at the minimum $107/yr and that's 10.7 billion. Now if that 10.7 billion were wiped out in an instant, how is Netflix going to make new shows or seasons of existing shows? It's the same with the rest of the content creation business. You and me, we're just a drop in the bucket when it comes to their revenue, but instead of scooping it out a spoonful at a time while adding water by the cup, somebody dumped the bucket over, there would be no money left to pay the content creators before content is even made. Railwayman I guess you like DRM and proprietary vendor lock in? The only moral of the story is: Pay for legit services then and watch posted content - the creators get paid and you get proper content without restrictions. The day the industry realize that DRM, geo blocking and so forth are counter productive will be historic. Fedup Love my Moto G5 Plus. Best phone I've had so far - and that's coming from a number of Samsung flagship phones. It's so much snappier and the battery life is insane. I waited a full 48 hours before caving and unlocking/rooting. Haven't looked back. I hate ads, and w/o root, you can't miracast to anything other than chromecast. Trysta Noticed this a little while ago. The crazy thing is I'm not even rooted or interested in any mods. I needed to sideload the latest version 7.1.2 because my RMA Nexus 6p refused to update on its own. I'm keeping the bootloader unlocked so I can recover if my phone boot loops. I rarely use Netflix on my phone but this is kind of annoying. I suspect this has something to do with offline movie watching (which is amazing). jj14x You don't need to unlock bootloader to sideload the full OTA images that Google publishes on their website. Tim Harman But you do need it to recover in your phone bootloops, as he said. jj14x True, but by that logic, everyone should keep their phone's bootloader unlocked all the time (because a bootloop, in theory, could happen to anyone/anytime) - not just when flashing a factory image. EowynCarter You don't ? Had to when installing a developper preview. Then I left it that way, so I won't be locked out in case of boot loop. TedPhillips or when you have some random block on disk get corrupted, ala nexus 9. ilovetesla Dumbest blocking I've ever heard Bruce Wayne I stopped rooting ages ago. Android has gotten so good that I don't need it anymore. Muzzy996 Good for you! Not everyone feels the same though, I know I sure don't. Tasker, Adaway, Greenify, Titanium, Substratum and GMD Gesture Controls are all more important to me than Netflix. The day Netflix stops working on my rooted devices (which are what I watch it on, not my TV) is the day I'll cancel my service. No big loss compared to losing root. Richard Markert Tasker is interesting but never felt the need for it. Adaway, titanium are both irrelevant on my S7, I despise gestures beyond simple swiping in the Cardinal directions, and if stock Android is so perfect why do you need to theme it? C64 I have a s7 edge and the stockrom is full of bloatware from Microsoft, Sansung and Google. More than 20 useless apps are included. So yes the s7 needed root. tim242 Wrong. Package Disabler, no root required. Richard Markert No, it doesn't. Everything not necessary for function is disableable. C64 You can't disable everything Muzzy996 Never said android is perfect, if it was there wouldn't be any competition in the market or users such as myself who feel the need to customize Android. Root is not something I push onto others, its just something that I want on my devices and I make choices about what services I use or devices I purchase based upon my ability to do it. Railwayman I take that you like ads, then? Using a non-rooted Samsung without Taller would be like using a feature phone again but with ads. Having an automated device without ads and bloat is certainly a basic requirement to me. Richard Markert Adhell and Disconnect pro. What's an ad? Railwayman I don't see any ads on my Ericsson GF388 either. Don't have to install a single piece of software in order to get there. Ericsson win, Samsung loose.:) Your Samsung still has Google ad services and so forth running even if you are blocking them on the "non root level". My devices are completely ad free with Google ads disabled system wide and in all apps. Samsung loose every time even if their followers are trying to find different "non root methods" to "solve" things that other devices do without any issues due to... root. kostas110 maybe if you use some 500+ euro smartphone from 2016-2017 something that not everyone can do C64 I disagree, Android is one big advertising if you don't use root. Apps have ads (not every app has a pro version), internet browsing sucks without Adaway (build in ad blockers in browsers aren't great), YouTube really sucks if it isn't modded (watch a 30 second ad for a 3 minute movie). And devices are full of bloatware that can't be removed without root. Even the Google stuff are bloatware (kiosk, movies,music,books etc). I also like to remove alot of system apps and replace them with my own apps that i prefer (file manager, agenda, email, music/ video player) and i really hate duplicate apps on my devices. Also Titanium Backup is important to me. So Android​ without root isn't Android for me. jetscreamer01 I use adguard to block stupid ads in my apps. Now using any commercial apps is enjoyable. Richard Markert Samsung's Internet has the Adblock extension and it literally blocks everything. I also use Disconnect Pro and Adhell for system-wide ad blocking. Titanium Backup I never really used even back when I was rooting phones - it has been replaced 100% by Smart Switch. But then, I haven't needed to restore a backup (except for switching devices) in years, probably because I don't run janky community junkroms. Muzzy996 The only reason you feel that Smart Switch completely replaces Titanium is because you never used other features of Titanium that go beyond what Smart Switch is intended for. Things like shortcuts to freeze/defrost apps, multiple version backups or market management are useful to some even if they're on rooted stock OEM ROMs. They're not must haves for the masses though but some of us do appreciate their usefulness. Cyber_Akuma I hate this response. If anything, I have found far more reasons to root than ever before. Being able to create a backup image and install security/tracking software tat can't just be wiped/uninstalled easily is a big one for example. DJMix I really couldn't understand these kind of stupid moves. I mean I kinda get for an Android Pay or some banking apps to implement these limitations. But seriously, a frickin' streaming app? Afraid they're gonna get pirated? For someone who's going to pirate, they probably could just probably reverse engineer the apk and remove the limitations or basically use older apps. Do they really have some idle engineers that they're forced to implement useless feature? ddevito Guess I'll just pirate it all soon. Their loss. JD Fuck Android If OEMs would fucking provide updates for 5 years I wouldn't need to unlock my bootloader. I'm out. I'll come back when Google fixes this shit. Also fuck Netflix. Back to pirating it is. Christopher Bement My app stopped working on my N7 when I sideloaded 5.0. Got an error when trying to play anything. I went and dropped it back to stock on the latest patch and relocked the bootloader. All working fine now. Too fucking bad, Nougat is fantastic on that device, leaps and bounds better than Marshmallow. tehboogieman Which ROM and which N7 do you have? I still have the stock ROM on my 2013 N7 LTE and have been procrastinating loading an N ROM on it Christopher Bement 2013 LTE version and I was using Nitrogen OS (fantastic and stable ROM). I am now on the latest Marshmallow just so that Netflix will work. tehboogieman As long as I can side load it and sign in I'm still ok. It's a pain, but I'd live with that. But if NF blocks root users from signing in, I'm definitely cancelling and just use one of the very easy pirate apps. Fedup As long as you can side load... Sure. But going from "hidden app in the Play store" to "sideloaded app won't run" is probably on the menu. Wayne Randall I just signed up for Netflix so I could cancel it. I'm part of the group. tim242 You paid them... Richard Markert Hahahahahaha I don't even use Netflix on my phone (screen is too small) so I don't care. But man, the tears and butthurt from the root community is hilarious. Benjamin Walburn You're a very petty child. Richard Markert When something makes me laugh, I point it out. I do that even have a dog in this hunt. I only watch Netflix on my 75" LED TV. I'm just tired of root users smugness. Almost as smug as apple users. Benjamin Walburn You're tired of people being smug in their hobbies, so you gloat about the problems inflicted on them pointlessly? Petty and a hypocrite. Richard Markert What else am I supposed to do to remove the smugness? My name is…. Get a life maybe? Benjamin Walburn Why should you? Is another person's happiness really that painful for you? You already know that they accomplished nothing more than "successfully followed instructions." It seems like your purpose would be better served by targeting that, not just being a jerk. Humbling them is one thing, being an ass is another entirely. tim242 You sound like the petty child. Stomp your foot, becauseyou don't get your way. Benjamin Walburn Not only am I not doing that, I'm not not getting my way, and "stomping​ my foot" is not an example of pettiness. Your wrongness-density is impressive. My name is…. Who beat you as a child? Richard Markert Lol koiulpoi You're on androidpolice.com... making fun of the root community... and unable to see past the end of your nose... Don't you have anything better to do? Richard Markert Actually, no. I read Android police because they have the best coverage of software. koiulpoi I didn't realize I replied to you twice. You're all over this article, with really, nothing better to do, huh? Richard Markert Yeah, I'm bored. I'm probably done stirring shit up anyway, today is water change day on my fish tanks. lomsha Tard Railwayman Are you one of those Samsung Apologists that argue against root and proudly tell everyone about the perfection known as Grace UX... just to install Package Dsabler Pro because... something disturb all "perfectness" of their system? Trying to be an "anti-social elitist" is like proudly use Simple Finder on a Mac and tell everyone that you don't need the regular Finder.;) Richard Markert I use Samsung, but only because it offers the best mix of software and hardware for me. And package disablers are garbage. Railwayman I avoid Samsung like a plague because of Knox 0x1 Warranty Void, Grace UX (TW...) and pretty ugly hardware not to mention the software design, which looks like a cheap toy, both colors, design and all S-This and S-That they preinstall. Don't forget DT Ignite so the carriers can add their share. It is always amusing when the Samsung Apologist proudly claim how good it is to live without root and how "mature Android has become" when they are talking about a heavily modified fork of it. If Samsung could replace Google Play with Galaxy Apps, they would. The only thing restricting them from further modification is the CTS in order to be able to use Play. An unrooted Samsung running Grace? It would be like having a feature phone again. Way too many annoyances and no way of making it more pleasurable since the whole thing is... Samsung. The only area where there are some reminiscence of Android is under the About box. Samsung is a disgrace not to mention a complete parody on the concept of an Android device. Not to mention their followers who recently "spotted" the bezel less display (introduced by Sharp and LG followed by Xiaomi) because... the S 8 got it AND suddenly made it a "requirement". The most kind thing I can say about that brand is this: Samsung is for the Android device and platform what McDonald's is for the thing called food.;) There are way better devices available. Buying a Samsung is like getting a Big Mac (the difference is that the Big Mac buyers doesn't claim its superiority - while Samsung buyers always try to claim how "superior" their devices are). Richard Markert Everything in your first paragraph is purely subjective. I find the design of the Pixel to be ugly, boring and derivative. AOSP design language doesn't appeal to me. I also think Samsung's software suite is better than Google's. My 935U doesn't have DTIgnite, but my 935V does...as does the Verizon branded V20, Moto Turbo2, etc. DTIgnite is a Verizon thing. Bezel less phones are sexy, for sure. That Sharp device was a Sharp device, and the Xiaomi has a CDMA radio so I could use it on Verizon , but just can't justify buying a thousand dollar device from China. It is stupidly gorgeous though. I use Samsung because I like the software design. I like the functionality of the base is and apps, and I like the S-app suite. I really miss my Note 7, and I'll be swapping up to a Note 8 when it's out. Don't get me wrong, Samsung phones have their negatives - chief among them is the fragile design and the screen edge touch rejection sucks ass. But for me, the positives outweigh the negatives. Other phones have bigger negatives for me. No IP68, no uSD card, no wireless charging, no SAMOLED display. Phone preference are always subjective. Somebody will always have a reason to pick one over another. Tell me, if Samsung is a "parody" of the concept of an Android device, what is your description of the perfect Android device? I'm guessing it's the Pixel. Railwayman Pixel is an ugly iPhone clone. The best Android device so far would be something like a Xiaomi Mi Mix running Resurrection Remix or similar ROM or something like a Mi Max but with perfection added through a Snapdragon 835, 256GB storage plus microSDand 6-8GB RAM paired with a 1440p 6.44" display or even 4K. 5000-6000 mAh battery. My Xiaomi Mi Max is excellent but would be even better with the aforementioned hardware (I can't fault is existing hardware but I am taking about a new model). A keyboard flipcover would be a great accessory as well. There are no device yet worthy of the perfect moniker yet but my Max is the best thing so far in my collection beside the Nokia Communicators and HTC TP2 and HD2 and also the Xperia Z Ultra when I do the holistic judgment. IP68? Sony all the way to me if I really insist. MicroSD? No need for a Samsung in order to get it. Yes, Samsung is a kind of a parody of an Android device die to their heavy modifications, restrictive policies, low price /performance ratio, carrier branding and Knox 0x1 Warranty Void. The upcoming OnePlus 5 looks promising - they usually get their things right. MicroSD on that one as well.;) If Samsung make a device without any BS such as restrictions, carrier links paired with good price / performance ratio I would be interested. Let's call it a Note Pro. What I don't like with Samsung are all Apologists making excuses for their policies. I have nothing against them as a company or production. They can make excellent products but their policies stop them right now. It is too much McDonald's mainstream and too little class at this time. Carrier devices are typically too mainstream than the unlocked ones. MadMartigan What are are you, seven? me me A primary reason to root is to run adblock because Google is way too greedy. So the irony, Google's greed means there's less reason to pay for NetFlix. Let me guess... shall we? Google Play Movies still works right...? Oh yes, so long as Google makes their money.... tim242 I block ads with Adguard. No root required. Mike | Homeless On Wheels People still use Netflix? Bit Torrent is your friend. dizel123 Exactly. Everyone should stop using Netflix. Not sure how I'm gonna get the shows i currently watch on Netflix from bit torrent since they won't be made anymore once Netflix is shut down, but at least I'll have my bit torrent friend tim242 Some people like to do things properly. Railwayman You mean - Do it with DRM? You can't buy whatever device you want because a content provider disagree. You can't use the system you want because a content provider disagree. You can't use the app you want because a content provider disagree. I need a lot of apps, ads and limitations for the so called "proper way" . The "improper way" is Samsung free, ad free and bloat free - and I don't need several apps because I have just one or two streaming apps, one media player, one book reader and so on. Fast and efficient system to boot. I think I prefer to do things "improperly". Richard Markert >The "improper way" is Samsung free, ad free and bloat free - and I don't need several apps because I have just one or two streaming apps, one media player, one book reader and so on. Fast and efficient system to boot. *sigh* I bet you think deleting the APKs from /system actually gives you more space in /data, too. Railwayman Perhaps you can tell me the benefit of having Kindle, Kobo and Nook instead of MoonReader for everything. The benefits of having an uprooted system, Netflix, Hulu and a couple of apps for different cable services instead of having just one media center would also be interesting to know more about. When we are at it: Why would I want to use a 3GB+ Samsung ROM when Resurrection Remix are 600 MB and the G-Apps around 340 MB? Richard Markert I dont use any of those. Phones are too small for media consumption. I don't have any video streaming or playback apps on my phone. Nor do I have book readers, but why wouldnt I want Kindle? It's the only way to access the Amazon library... Oh wait, I forgot, you do that believe in compensating content creators. Resurrection remix, really? If I put that on my S7 edge, I'd be wiping out half the hardware's capabilities in one blow. No Samsung pay, no edge panels, no pro mode camera, no AOD, no game tools, no GearVR. And im sure none of the little things I've come to expect in my UI, like direct calling and sliding a contact to call/txt. But I can move the clock to the other side of the notification shade, woohoo! Oh and does the installer for RR rom repartition the file system? Because if not, /system will still be 3gb, not 600mb. And on top of that, I'm immediately reminded of iOS when I looked at their screenshots. Railwayman So RR looks like iOS? Interesting. It looks like Android with Material Design on my device. I buy Kindle books but send them through a plug-in since the Kindle app pretty much suck in comparison with MoonReader. Sometimes I also buy from Google Play Books and it is also a trip through the plug-in for them and then into the MoonReader library. You see - DRM is a stupidity that must go way unless they create a device wide scheme so any app can authenticate and show or play back the content. I understand that Samsung phones are too small for media consumption. A 6.44-7 inch display is different - it works comfortably without the heft of a 10-12 inch tablet. Small displays below 6-6.3 inches are just too small. So your listed features of your Samsung are hardware? They certainly sound like software to me. Or do you seriously believe that Samsung use co-processors in their device like Commodore did on the Amiga? I can assure you that your Samsung contain standard hardware with a lot of subcontracted components, especially in the US market where they even use Qualcomm CPUs. Samsung Pay? Why would I use an OEM dependent payment system? My credit cards follow a standard, why should I pick myself into a specific device OEM just to pay? It makes no sense. It is like having a car that only runs on Citgo gas or a 4" Visa card requiring different terminals than my 4.5" MasterCard. Mobile payments will be a thing when a standard are in place. Payment systems requiring me to lock myself into a specific OEM just suck. Edge panels? Don't see the need. Don't like Edge displays with their optical side effects. Flat display or just slight roundness on the edges like the BlackBerry PRIV here. Pro Mode Camera? I prefer to have the Open Camera API so any app can get RAW from the sensor and do their thing rather than locking myself into the default camera app. I prefer Camera FV-5 or A Better Camera etc. The Snap Camera is good too. Always on display? Can set it up on my device but don't see the need when there are things such as Active Display and a lot of other options. Game tools? I don't see any problems with gaming on other Android versions so I just don't see what Samsung can add in this regard. Gear VR? Why would I want to strap my device to my face when there are dedicated VR headsets available for gaming consoles and computers? I certainly prefer to have a full headset rather than using my device as one. Call features? They could be good but carrier calling is old fashioned. I use Google Voice instead and wouldn't consider going back to carrier talk and text. Don't see any benefit with having a phone number tied to a carrier of SIM card. Having more than one for different purposes on the same device without SIM dependency is the modern way. I don't know if RR repartition Samsung devices so you have to check XDA. That brand is probably the worst when it comes to ROMs anyway and a lot of my dislike of them are related to that particular issue. Samsung is nothing more than the Big Mac of Android devices and no Gear VR or Samsung Pay (it is like having a McDonald's Pay) really change anything. A mainstream device with mainstream design with too many round edges and corners not to say fragile, batteries that wear out fast due to lower quality and fast charge (which stresses the cells heavily), a software design looking "something" , bloat ware, carrier BS such as bloat ware and also the price model, Knox and root/ROM restrictions, locked bootloadern - the list goes on and on. Mainstream degenerated art is what Samsung represents. But I know the existence of people who don't believe in freedom of choice other than the freedom of buying their Samsung from their carrier and then happily oblige and reduction imposed to them all the way down to the SIM card dependent phone number and roaming charges when they travel.;) They also consider Samsung Pay to be the best thing ever - a payment system that only work on a particular OEM. It really is like a car that require Citgo gas and is unable to run on Exxon or Esso fuel. Samsung just are the Big Mac of Android devices. There are just nothing "classy" over such a carrier mainstream brand. If you want to know what luxury are? Look at Vertu. derp_cookies So I agree this is a dumb move but everyone is overreacting by threatening to pirate content. This is a niche problem as less people root now, especially since Android pay won't work when you do it. So Netflix isn't any less accessible than it was before. I watch 99% of Netflix at home on my Roku. Luxferro It's not just rooting. My Nexus 6P is running stock google rom, no root, w/ just unlocked bootloader, and netflix is gone in my play store. Not that I watch TV on my phone... but my shield tv is also unlocked... so it's probably just a matter of time. Roh_Mish Dammit Netflix, you make me want to go popcorn time route. My current primary phone and my iPad are what I use to watch netflix and both of them is stock so i don't have anything to worry about but this just feels wrong. Between this and Amazon not releasing the TV app for my sony TV, which they support outside, popcorn time (and in extension piracy) just seems easier. Vivek Rameses This is why we have piracy. Miguel Angel But ...why? occono Distributors want Netflix to stop any possibility of making DRM-Free backups on the content. Railwayman Good luck with that. If it can be played, it can be recorded. As long as the Netflix content is visible somewhere a copy can be recorded so again, good luck with blocking. Mariano Moreira Even more strange is while Netflix app is removed from Playstore, Netflix VR is still.in Playstore. Manually flashing Factory Image for Google Pixel is how I get me OS updates and I choose to leave bootloader unlocked, rather than relocking every month.(which would include full wipe) So I guess they don't care about security for the few users whom might use Netflix VR with Daydream compatible device? tehboogieman I'm not familiar with the Pixel, but almost every Nexus device lets you lock without wiping all your data. Maybe that requires root though, I really don't understand the details on how it works, but hopefully you can find a way to do it. Mariano Moreira To clarify: In order for me to install Factory Image every month, I need to have Bootloader unlocked. Doing the Factory unlock will wipe the device. Locking the device doesn't wipe the device, but Factory unlocking the bootloader will wipe the device. tehboogieman Yeah, sorry I wasn't more specific. I use an app called BootUnlocker. It lets you lock and unlock the bootloader without wiping at will. Since an app can do this, I'm assuming that it can be done via ADB. Also it might only work on older devices, but maybe there's a way to replicate this action on newer devices as well Mariano Moreira I don't understand why Google is promoting Security by having the device fully-locked, yet still relies on ADB fastboot unlock/OEM Unlock commands to flash factory images? saf1927 Why are using factory images when Google provides OTA images too, and these don't require an unlocked bootloader, nor a wipe? jdrch It's not just Netflix. The HDHomeRun Prime app doesn't work on rooted 7.0+ devices either. Jsilvermist Good to know, will no longer recommend Netflix to anyone when I'm asked... James F News flash: when you explain to most normal people why you don't recommend Netflix, they won't care, because it doesn't affect them. D13H4RD2L1V3 This is stupid. I had to root my phone to be able to hide the navbar at any time I want and also to gain better battery management controls and other stuff that I sorely wished Google had added to stock Android way sooner. And I was considering a Netflix subscription. No longer...... Sruly J I know it's not fully a solution which is "worth it", but the app Custom Navigation Bar offers the ability to hide status bar/narbar without root. Although like you said, you had other reasons to root, so... Diar I pay for Netflix so I can watch the content any way I want guilt free, whether that's their app or other locations on the Internet. F their VPN blocking and DRM. If they make their app impossible to use, I just won't use it. They'll still get my money but they will lose any data/tracking since I'll still be watching their shows, just outside of their ecosystem. Dummies. ReedSolomon Between the SJW nonsense like Bill Nye, the ipv6 tunnel blocking (rather than simply defaulting to ipv4), increases in price, less and less quality content, and now this, I see little reason to keep paying for Netflix. robogo I understand Netflix' reasons, I really do - they need to protect their property and investment. But I can't really say I understand the way they're doing this. This is a good way to alienate the small percentage of power users who root their devices for various, but perfectly valid and understandable reasons. And no, this will not make me cancel my membership as long as the app works. Cancelling membership is a silly, overblown reaction to what is, in my mind, a minor nuisance. D13H4RD2L1V3 I personally just find it a dumb move. Seems like an easy way out. Dmitri Smirnov > perfectly valid and understandable reasons. And what reason would that be? Preventing people from ripping their content? Doesn't stop them in the slightest, root-detection in circumvented rather easily as well as safety net, we have PokemonGo to thank for that - a lot of people were motivated to crack it and they succeeded. > Cancelling membership is a silly, overblown reaction to what is, in my mind, a minor nuisance. Cancelling membership is valid form of feedback to the company, that trying to tell it's customers that they are not allowed to own their device that they paid their money for, if they want to watch a movie. robogo You misunderstood, it seems. A perfectly valid and understandable reason to root one's device would be, e.g. Xposed framework, theming support, tethering, backing up stuff with Titanium Backup, etc. Please read my comment once again. EowynCarter Well, if and when it stops working on my phone, what will be a major nuisance. robogo Agreed. I'll have to find another way then. But I'll deal with that when the time comes. Manbearpig I member when netflix released there app for Android and they did the same thing. I would just download the app and be good to go. After awhile though I stop rooting I miss it sometimes Cyber_Akuma I warned people when Pokemon GO of all things had a surprise update that silently added SafetyNet that this garbage was going to become more and more common. Mario RUN uses it too, and now Netflix.... soon apps everywhere are going to add SafetyNet and block rooted devices as standard practice. Google has been incredibly hostile towards people who actually want to own or have control over their devices or even their PC Software over the last few years. And over the last year google has been making SafetyNet more and more harsh, now even tripping if your BOOTLOADER is unlocked even if your phone is not rooted. Pokemon GO and Mario RUN were a small crowd, but I hope after Netflix of all things starts using it (and make no mistake, this is just the beginning) that people will finally push back against Google's hostility towards rooted users. EowynCarter Yeah. Or I might seriously consider going the iOS way. Though iOS would pose other problems. (Bye paylib) BillPosters I rooted my Android phone to get rid of the annoying camera shutter sound, and to prevent apps from stealing my contacts, and to basically take control of my device rather than letting Google run the whole show, and because of that I can't update Netflix? Good riddance Netflix. iKon I'm pretty sure you can go in the camera settings and take of the camera shutter sound?.... .. In some region-specific firmware versions or certain devices you can't do that. Railwayman There is a better solution: Declare the device a DRM free zone and use everything else. DRM to me is "Don't Restrict Me!" and an excellent reason to give certain companies the middle finger telling them to just go and F themselves. The most ironic thing here is that removing Netflix or using DRM otherwise doesn't stop piracy. On the contrary - By buying and using DRM content you get to travel in the cargo hold with no heating while the pirating consumer get first class service: more content, no restrictions, no copyright trailers or ads before the movie start and stop on. Even better: They can use whatever apps or ROMs they want. Would I unroot my device in order to get DRM content onboard? No way!!! If Netflix are so scared - block the client on Mac OS X and Windows et al. Piracy doesn't usually happen with an Android device as a source but rather computers and HDCP rippers. Another thing also to the DRM companies: Everything that can be played back can be recorded! (Good old piracy saying) Netflix out, Fusion with Exodus, SALTS and Phoenix in. Kodi with Rapier skin is much nicer than the Netflix client and Trakt integration make this way a much better one than going down the DRM route, sitting with an uprooted stock ROM and Netflix.;) TechJunkie198 ? netflix isn't scared. the studios require the drm. and netflix isn't concerned with the small percent of users who root their devices. Railwayman Doesn't matter. Go and enjoy your DRM services.;) DRM is a pest and that is why the pirating community offer a superior product. It is easier and more hassle free to just put Netflix where they belong and use Exodus et al or MovieBox or Terrarium TV and so on. To those who now consider unrooting because of Netflix: Just don't - use other services instead. Richard Markert So when everybody takes your advice and uses a service that doesn't compensate anybody in the content creation business, and all the high-quality media is gone, don't go crying about there being nothing good to steal anymore, k? Railwayman Even better: DRM and proprietary vendor lock in are scrapped and replaced by standards. If they want some kind of protection - make it device wide and linked to the account signed in so playback works in different apps - only thing needed is to call the system wide authentication system. I am against DRM and vendor restrictions. Original content without any of the BS is what the world need. Piracy is a symptom of several problematic things such as geo restrictions, root restrictions and the failed idea of the "right of no distribution" - i.e. the content exist but stubborn companies deny distribution using silly arguments. I always remove DRM from purchased content in order to have full control including the basic right of using whatever app or equipment for playback. Richard Markert Start developing the solution, and start a content creation company that can compete with the big boys when it comes to quality content. Or, you can sit around and whine online about the content creators not wanting the people who don't follow rules to play in their gated sandbox and get mad when you crawl over the fence. Railwayman I take that you like DRM and proprietary vendor lock-in. It is easy to avoid the gated sandbox so no need to whine. It is easier to just fire up Exodus rather than relocking the bootloader and flashing a stock ROM or remove SuperSU in favor of Magisk just to be able to get Netflix. DRM is such a waste of time. It's not necessary to develop a new service since the content are available DRM free already. Standards for media and books etc does exist or did you miss EPUB, PDF, AAC, MP3, MP4 and so on? Perhaps you prefer such a format as ZNO or Apple modified EPUB that only works with iBooks? saf1927 Magisk seems to do the trick. Helios What about my non-rooted OnePlus One? It's also listed as incompatible.. '-_- 天地人 Don't OnePlus devices run a custom ROM and have unlocked bootloaders? Android Developer How can they block people who root the device from installing the app? The play store doesn't have this filter. Maybe after the install they do this check? Richard Markert If you're really an Android Developer, you would know that SafetyNet is what's doing this "behind the scenes". Android Developer I'm talking about the article. They say that Netflix blocks rooted devices, and I know that this isn't an option on the developer console. Google doesn't have anything related to rooted devices there. Ezio I have about 200 original blu-ray disks, go to cinema, and I'm Netflix subscriber. Now I won't get app updates (or even worse I won't be able to use it in the future) just because I like to use my custom rom. Thank you. This is really a bad move. AdjustedFlow I thought netflix was about providing a better service than piracy. Now they're literally pushing me back to piracy. What the heck? Dany If for "root" they mean administrator privileges, don't we already have that on windows 10? So why Netflix doesn't block desktop version too? P.S. by the way...whatever man! I was using Kodi more than this crap anyway... Miku is Best Vocaloid This means Netflix won't be getting my business anymore. Paul Sterling No worries here, when you're legit. Take my money, I'm not cheap. Give me a service, I'll pay you. I don't need to rob. What am I? 13 living with my mom using Napster? Naw, grew up. Don't have any Tim foil hats. My wallet grew up too. ast00 This is a dick move that could have been avoided. If they want us to pirate their content instead, we will pirate their content. We tried doing it the legal way, but they didn't allow it. Their problem, not ours. EowynCarter Umf. **checks google play ** No longer compatible with my nexus 6 . But nexus 4 still ok. For crying out loud! I'm not rooted or using a custom ROM. Pyramid Power netflix is just losing money. it's saying to those people, 'go to thepiratebay!' RemiV2 I guess I'll just keep torrenting then. Thanks, Netflix.

Netflix is a client app. If I can, with a rooted phone, fake my subscription, or somehow cause a major security issue, that is not a problem with me, that is a problem with you pushing out a vulnerable app to millions of users. Sure, it would be my fault for exploiting it, but there is no-one but you who managed to put the problem in place. A CLIENT app should not be anything but a front-end representation of an API run by your servers. The CLIENT should have nothing but a CLIENT ID to use with the API. The CLIENT should NOT be able to change JACK SHIT with the API, it should only be able to get search results, get access to encrypted streams, etc. If your client CAN change JACK SHIT (which one could assume is true, since you are so actively hiding your code) then you have a major security vulnerability... This is a problem with your code, not anyone's rooted device... Hell, you don't even need a rooted device to access the applications code, just download an APK of the app, extract it, and decompile it... Jesus netflix, get your shit straight you bendy pos... BahnStormer Netflix is used more on tablets and TV boxes, these tend to be used for several years longer than phones and even Google now only updates their devices for <2 years (Samsung / streamer manufacturer's do this even less!)... We HAVE to run the likes of Lineage if we want the devices to be secure! Bye bye Netflix, even Amazon Video lets us use rooted devices! jcopernicus People don't understand IP and lambast a company protecting it. Of course. RemixedCat well they got rid of 5 star ratings, deleted tons of shows I was in the middle of, and the roku app is hella slow and takes 10 freakin minutes to load (by comparison my OS install from power on to desktop was 8 minutes on my samsung 850 500GB SSD!!) Tobi I'm running LineageOS on my Oneplus One to lengthen the lifespan of my device. Why must I be punished for that? I'm going back to pirating content. StankyChikin Possible that the movie industry is pushing this? SkullOne Shhhhh. Don't use logic here. It's not allowed. It's simply easier to blame Netflix and believe that they have a vendetta against the teeny tiny, itsy bitsy amount of root users out there! StankyChikin Forgive me plz lol username_not_valid This isnt about Netflix, its about its content providers. There is this notion that you can copy files and therefore pirate content if you are rooted. We all know its rubbish, Netflix probably knows its rubbish, but that doesn't change anything. If Netflix wants shows, its has to abide by its license agreements. There is really nothing Netflix, Amazon, Sky or any other streaming service can do about it. The fact that almost all pirate content comes from PCs and HDCP by-pass devices doesnt mean a thing. TedPhillips at least in practice, unlocking your bootloader/being rooted has no impact on your widevine support level. now, i'm not sure if the oem could supply a high-level drm library on a pre-rooted device, due to agreements, but modification after the point of sale is a different matter. meanwhile, keep on streaming netflix on your 'rooted' computer - gasp!~ Richard Markert >meanwhile, keep on streaming netflix on your 'rooted' computer - gasp!~ I don't even need an admin account to steal Netflix on my PC. Since the Windows 10 app and browsers BOTH work over analog, all I need is an inline box with a DSUB VGA connector and simply capture the entire output from the VGA port. Valerie Frye-Preter Did they do this because of the stolen season 5 of Orange is the New Black? TedPhillips wasn't that stolen before it was available for streaming? so i don't see how it could be. TedPhillips when the device can be retroactively uncertified, as safetynet mutates over time, that's a step beyond the usual forced obsolescence of artificially short software support windows. now instead of buying a new phone every 18-24 months, it could be literally whenever they feel like moving the goalposts. Mike Hunt I don't understand. I am a Netflix subscriber, but will probably have to unsubscribe now since I bought a rooted Chinese mediabox for my TV. This sucks, as I liked and supported NetFlix's business model. Richard Markert Which box do you have? Mike Hunt One of these https://www.aliexpress.com/wholesale?catId=0&initiative_id=SB_20170514131212&SearchText=media+box+mini+m8s Brock Reed I'm not even getting the "not compatible" message, it's just not showing up at all. Ajmobileguru First DirecTV Now and now Netflix. I dont see the point. As if rooted users were pirating the streams or movies. Rooted users on non-nexus/pixel devices already were getting only 480p because of widewine crap and now this. Anunnaki This is why people switch to apps like Popcorn Time and Terrarium TV. Biga173rd Popcorn time still works? Anunnaki When I last checked few months ago, it was working. No idea about the current situation though. Biga173rd Okay Erin Andrews Oh that's easy, they block my device I cancel my subscription. Say goodbye to my 15 dollars a month. piggynuts Stopped playing Pokemon, stopped using Snapchat, next to go is Netflix. I refuse to say bye to root. BobButtons Magisk. While some say it's hit and miss with Pokemon GO (idk, I don't play it) it's never not worked for me with Snapchat/Android Pay/Mario Run. cliff_dangers Why does everyone freak out about a rooted phone but my PC which is wide open is not a problem? What makes smartphones so special? Doro Manekia ΝετΦλξ Ανάθεμα σου.Χα χα χα Το Μαααακα. Bewear I am not that upset because I rarely use Netflix on my mobile, I am upset because this kind of blocking will become a trend. BoFiS ugh, fuck you, Netflix, I pay for your serve, LET ME USE IT ON MY PHONE A.M There are some many ways around that LAME NETFLIX - Showbox Kodi Firestick with Kodi I can't see the point of Netflix when we have so MANY better apps out there that kill Netflix ErectBipedal That'll teach them filthy pirates for trying to pay us money!.... wait.... -Netflix probably Zxyon Rhysivz What could users with unlocked/rooted phones do with the Netflix app that other users can't? Loco Mole Netflix content isn't that much better these days, so if they choose to distinguish themselves by being a d*ck to consumers who care about using our devices the way we want to, then f u too, Netflix, I got plenty of other legit streaming content. Fedup Let's see... Piracy: $0.00, no ads, no DRM, no device/location/time restrictions Legit: $$$, ads out the as$, DRM limiting options, shows locked to specific devices, locations, etc. Keep on making the decision easier for us, Netflix. xyz Fortunately, the Pirate Bay is accessible from all devices and regions without any geo-blocking. berserksgangr Well, my Nexus 7 with Lineage it's not working even without root (error 9) Nick Riley This is utterly stupid! Corvus Dove Remember that time that making things more difficult for software and media pirates through DRM while possibly messing with legitimate customers paid off and prevented piracy? Me either. Asbjørn The problem here is that most users root their phone to get the updates that their OEM doesn't want to make available. If Android had proper updates, rooting would not be so necessary. Patel Nisha Root user here. How do I use Magisk for this? I have it installed and new to the Magisk(haven't had a rooted phone in a while)? Keletor Does it stop you from sideloading it? I mean really, if you are rooting your phone you most likely will find a workaround. Luxferro Not yet, but you can be sure the app will stop working in the future. Znuff The download feature is not working for me anymore. And the 5.x app is not working at all, just says I need to install the 4.x one (redirects me to the download page) Tim Get Roku tv or a fire stick cause no issues there and it isn't through Google then Biga173rd People still use Netflix? mlauzon And this is exactly how you piss off your end users! Doug Rogers I guess I'll have to unroot - whoops, Android 4.2 Awesome. Luxferro Don't forget to leave your 1 star review. Links to both apps (Android TV and the normal Android app) https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.netflix.mediaclient&hl=en&rdid=com.netflix.mediaclient https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.netflix.ninja&rdid=com.netflix.ninja Yoda’s Spirit Seems they keep cracking down on anything Open internet related! The only way I can watch overseas now is using Mediahint.com - nothing else works. Luxferro Just use usenet. They are forcing their legit customers to piracy... DDS This move will not stop people from pirating their content, it will encourage it. Exactly the opposite of what they're trying to achieve. But tell that to the a**hats who control the money... Ubelsteiner And thus, Plex and Kodi become even more popular, as Netflix drives a nail into it's own coffin. Znuff http://i.imgur.com/LG3dXc4.jpg http://i.imgur.com/eNeuPCD.jpg Can not use the latest version on my device, it sends me to download the 4.x version. When I try that, the latest 4.x version has Downloads disabled for me (it used to work on this device). US Patriot No worries. I can live without Netflix, but I will NOT live without full control of my devices and data. Ricardo A. Fragoso For those who want root at all cost there's still a chance to get movies with ChromeCast Support... Google "TerrariumTV". :D You are welcome. :D Sir Doogie Houser M.D.Esq. 200 Mobile devices are now a vice.The rules,whether stringent or lenient,if there's demand,the market will fill the demand.Plain and simple.So to Mr.Gable,your wrong buttercup. Nick Coad I can guarantee you that Netflix doesn't make these choices willingly. The production companies they purchase shows off are notoriously backward when it comes to technology and unfortunately Netflix relies on them to survive.

Google implements further changes for developers to help protect user data Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/05/12 5:13am PDTMay 12, 2017 11 Plus 1 on G+ 24 Share on Facebook 44 Share on Twitter Total Shares79 Applications Development News Earlier in the month, Google released an official statement on a particularly virulent phishing email imitating Google Docs that was doing the rounds. That same day, coincidentally or not, an update to the Gmail Android app added a special warning page that pops up every time a link in one of the suspect emails is clicked. Now, Google is implementing further changes to help prevent future scams of this type. Announced on the Google Developers Blog, the efforts include updates to developer identity guidelines, risk assessment systems, and the user-facing consent page. This will make for a stricter web application publishing process, and while it will probably make it a little more difficult to register or modify apps it will make it easier for Google to root out misleading or spoofed identities. Further to those changes, there will be enhanced risk assessment for web apps requesting user data. Some apps will now require a manual review, putting data permissions on hold in the meantime. For now, such a review can only be requested during testing and should take between 3 and 7 days to complete. In the future, you should be able to request a review during the registration process. Any web apps that don't pass the review process will be restricted long before they ever reach unsuspecting users. Google took immediate action in the wake of the phishing email threat earlier this month and is once again showing how highly it values data security and online safety — something all of us Android users can be very thankful for.

MJ Who will protect us from you posting duplicate posts? Google and your data is simple... Don't use their products if you don't trust them. 4Ui812 The duplicate wasn't intentional. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ They have this magical "delete" button. 4Ui812 I actually didn't know that. Thanks. Nick Coad Came here to see if there were any tinfoil-hat-wearers in the comments, was not disappointed. Thank you. 4Ui812 Google implements further changes for developers to help protect user data But who will protect our data from Google Gen. Chang Google gives users an incredible amount of control over what data is collected and controls over who can see any if it. They are exceedingly transparent, and even though I use many of the privacy options, I hardly ever feel like I'm being taken advantage of. And as others note, if you don't trust Google, then you don't have to use their products, because there are tons of choices available. The biggest issue, is people don't do their homework. They don't research things indepth. The protections that come from using Google products, far outweigh anything they do to monetize their products. Nick Coad Exactly, they go well beyond what they're required to do by law in order to give people control over their data, and yet people still complain because they read some panicky article online without bothering to actually explore their account settings and privacy options.

Alexa can now double-check if you actually said a wake word Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/15 12:54pm PDTMay 15, 2017 4 Plus 1 on G+ 8 Share on Facebook 33 Share on Twitter Total Shares45 News My Google Home isn't the best at figuring out if me (or someone else) actually says "Hey Google" or "OK Google." Sometimes I'll be watching a video where no one says anything remotely similar to those phrases, and the lights on my Home flip on. But I have noticed that most of the time, the lights turn off a split-second later, as the Home actually realizes that no one called for it (presumably once the voice clip is processed by Google's servers). Amazon appears to be giving Alexa a similar ability, with the introduction of 'Cloud-based wake word verification.' Essentially, any device with Alexa already listens for a wake word with the Wake Word Engine (WWE). But now, an additional cloud-based check verifies the phrase. If the second check thinks it was an accidental trigger, it will tell the device to close the audio stream and turn off the voice indicator. Manufacturers will have to update their Alexa-equipped devices to use the new verification, but Amazon has tried to make the process as painless as possible. The new Ecobee4 smart themostat is the first generally-available product using this new feature.

StealthEdge We've all seen and know what Bruce Wayne is doing. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQNeqeVpHF0 ericshmerick What people don't realize with Alexa and Google Home is you don't have to pause after saying the wake word. Basically everyone goes "Alexa....pauses for a second" then speaks. It's always listening for the wake word, so you can just rip off a continuous normal speed request all at once. So like "OK Google what's the weather like" with zero pause. Just say the request without any delay at all, even very fast. It'll catch it. I dunno, peeve of mine I guess. Max Gromada That pause is a habit of talking to humans. Why wouldn't Alexa answer "YES, MY LORD" every time you call it? H. You usually wait to see the light or hear the peep as confirmation that it is listening. Because at least for me she reacts maybe 2 times out of 3 to being called.

Now, it has made its way to be a standalone app that works on both Android devices and Google’s home assistant hardware. However, a new rumor claims that Google Assistant will also get a standalone app targeted for iOS users. According to Android Police, a source close to Google confirmed that the company is currently developing a standalone Google Assistant app for iOS. Furthermore, it is said that the new app will be revealed in the next couple of days. More specifically, during this year’s Google I/O event. The source also said that the app will include all the voice command features. Features that are present on the Android implementation of the app. Also, the iOS version will have an Allo-like chatbot as an additional feature. Unfortunately, apart from that, nothing much is know about the supposed iOS app. Google Assistant app on Android (via blog.google.com) On the other hand, the software developer kit for the Google Assistant is now being prepared for an iOS release. This means that the SDK will soon be available for iOS developers to implement the feature in their apps. Clearly, Siri is no longer the most sought-after personal digital assistant for mobile applications. The advancements on artificial intelligence and machine learning paved the way for other virtual assistant apps like the Amazon Alexa. It is still too soon to tell whether Apple will allow its developers to make use of Google’s very own digital assistant. There is a chance that it will push for developers to use Siri instead of the Google Assistant. However, to date, Apple is yet to release the SKD for its own virtual assistant. But until then, it seems like Google will be forcing Apple’s hands to finally make the Siri available to its developers.

[Deal Alert] Get a free official case when you buy a Pixel XL from the Google Store Richard Gao Follow View All Posts 2017/05/14 8:30am PDTMay 14, 2017 11 Plus 1 on G+ 51 Share on Facebook 44 Share on Twitter Total Shares106 Deals Google News Pixel XL It's been a couple of months since the Pixel and Pixel XL debuted, but it's still rare to come across a deal for them, especially on the XL model. In fact, we've posted a total of zero Deal Alerts on the non-Verizon Pixel XL. However, Google itself has decided to offer a free official case to anyone who purchases the Pixel XL from the Google Store. It's pretty simple: add any color/storage level of Pixel XL to your cart, then add either the $30 clear case or the $35 silicone case (your choice of color) to your cart. In your cart, you'll see the 'Buy Pixel XL, receive a Pixel XL Case by Google on us' text, along with a discount of either $30 or $35, depending on which case you got. Unfortunately, this doesn't work on any Live Cases, the LifeProof FRE, or the Otterbox Defender. Want to get in on this deal? Google simply says that the offer will be 'available while supplies last' from when it began at 12am PT today (May 14th). So if you've been eyeing a Pixel XL and a case, but were waiting for some sort of little incentive, now may be the time to pull the trigger.

Google simply says that the offer will be 'available while supplies last" I'm pretty sure they mean while supplies of the phone lasts... Because they'll be out of stock again long before this offer ends. irtechneo Lol yep. Their inventory issues are mind boggling. I finally gave up trying to get one and went with S8+. Glad I did. Andrea Bittau I want to do the same but s8 ( normal )... how is bixby button ? useless ?! :/ irtechneo Bixby button is great! I use the app called bxActions and re-map it to the Google app. I now have a dedicated button for Google. Fantastic. Bixby itself is garbage (IMO). Michael Hannigan Don't. G6 is a better deal and a better phone. And I am a Samsung fanboy/fanman. Michael Hannigan Yeah, great move. Except the Pixel is a much better device. irtechneo In your​ opinion that may be true. Not in mine. I honestly don't like anything about the pixel hardware..I think it is one of the ugliest phones I have ever seen. The software experience can't be beat but that isn't all I factor into my purchasing decisions. Michael Hannigan You are right when you say that the overall experience cannot be beat. Michael Hannigan Ouch, ouch! shamatuu I can buy a laptop with that price longer with 769 bucks Cowboydroid You could get a used Pixel laptop for about half that price. Mix My laptop with a GTX 1050, 8gb of ram and an i7 quad core processor was cheaper than my 128gb PIxel XL, Canadian............. Never again. TechGuy22 So expensive Thanks to my 6p I got to buy the xl 128 gb only for 300 bucks. Kyle Null If you don't NEED a phone right now, you really shouldn't​ buy the Pixel. Wait for the Pixel 2 or something better. EowynCarter Yeah, I think that even if google where to finally make the pixel available in France, I would wait. I just hope google get their act together and actually do a worldwide release and my nexus 6 don't suffer some sudden death. Tk JunkMail My Nexus 6 is running Android 7 and Google Fi and is as fast as ever. No reason to replace it. EowynCarter Mine sometimes get laggy. Plus, no Android O. :( That's a shame. Michael Hannigan Google, like the rest of the world, really doesn't care about France. Sean O’Connor Problem is that waiting is what got me into this situation in the first place. I didn't buy a 6P last summer since the Pixel​ was around the corner, and I've only started seeing the model I want available within the past few weeks. I could wait again, but by the time I'm lucky enough to see the Pixel 2 I want in stock on the play store people will be talking about the Pixel 3. There is always some better device to wait for, but at a certain point I just need to get a new phone. Kyle Null I'm​ still using the Nexus 5 because I'm waiting for Google to release a reasonably priced device. At this rate, I might still be using the Nexus 5 in 2030. Vinayak Prabhu I was in the same boat, but finally jumped on to the S8+ Michael Hannigan Ouch! Andy I was in same boat. I ended up getting a moto z play. Its amazing for the price. I'll get the pixel 2 in the fall. Michael Hannigan It's a piece of crap, but a good piece of crap for the price. You seem to be one of the few reasonable peeps here. Michael Hannigan True dat, hookah. You hit da nail on da head. Tk JunkMail The Nexus 6 is running Android 7 and Google Fi and is as fast as ever. No reason to replace it. Cowboydroid My Nexus 6 was slow even on marshmallow. It was almost unusable on 7. Had to root and revert back. john gregson No more Google. 6P very poor for a person who deals with emotionally distressed clients. 8 hours maximum juice. Michael Hannigan Maybe you need to get better clients. Duder12 That shit battery life was a Qualcomm issue not a Google issue. Michael Hannigan You should have done a factory reset. That would have fixed it. Cowboydroid I did multiple resets. Michael Hannigan Ok, finally! Good. It's probably all set, then. You're welcome. Cowboydroid Mmmmm. Michael Hannigan But the Nexus 6 was/is a great phone. One of the best, if not the best, Nexus made. Alex Higgins The clear cases should have been free from the outset... Broke in me 3 months in. I'd pass on even the free one and opt for an awesome one on Amazon for half the price. Can't vouch for the silicone ones. Michael Hannigan "...pass on the free one"? Didn't think about that too long before blurting it out, did you? Alex Higgins Didn't have to. Had one, wasn't worth $30, isn't worth having even if it's free. Phone's great, though. Michael Hannigan That doesn't make sense. Alex Higgins Obviously, given the rest of your comments, you're offended by anyone with an opinion different from yours. So, in the interest of offending you further, I'll reply again. It makes sense if I want my phone to be protected. That clear case actually scratched my phone on the corners. So, yeah. Makes plenty of sense to me. Free != Good. Michael Hannigan I'm afraid you have overestimated my concern. Nothing in a comment section an online forum could offend me. I can't really be offended by people who don't know me. But to be realistic, I would suggest you just accept the free gift - since refusing it would either mean not getting your phone at all or delaying your shipment while you try to explain how you want it shipped in a special way from everyone else - without the free case. Idiotic. I guess I am a little offended by your stupidity, but not in a personal way. Bobby R. Blair Don't be offended by stupidity. Stupid can't be fixed. One of my pet peaves is ignorance. Ignorance is a choice. Now that does offend me. jamaniek LOL, 769$ still. Google is ridiculous with the pricing. M6 That's not ridiculous. If they have such limited stock and can't keep up with existing orders (granted that's their fault, they're missing out on a lot of demand), why drop the price? It would be ridiculous to drop the price at this point before they can at least fulfill existing orders jamaniek Considering people that already placed their orders and didn't receive them yet- yes I see your point and I agree. But other than that the price is way too high by today's standards. We've got better and faster phones at that price and as fast ones at lower prices. Pixel is probably still one of the best phones (if not the best) when it comes to pure user experience, but I don't think that this factor alone justifies spending this much on it. Richard Gozinya I dont think its that ridicules when its put in context, How much is a Iphone 7, a Samsung S7 edge, S8+ all about the same jamaniek iPhone 7 Plus costs 718$ on Amazon for 128GB option, S7 Edge costs 515$ and OP3T goes for 439$. S8+ is a completely different story, as it is a new, faster phone. May be overpriced, but still... Bruce It was ridiculously overpriced when it launched. Today it's laughable. Google wants to charge Apple prices without the associated services. Apple supports their phones for 4-5 years. Google guarantees OS updates for 18 months. Apple has stores you can walk in and get any problems fixed. Google finger points and doesn't accept blame with all the hardware problems. On a hardware level, the iPhones themselves have far fewer problems. Even if Google were to acknowledge a hardware problem, it doesn't have enough phones in stock to offer a replacement. One could simply swap out a problematic iPhone in a store. I would never buy an iPhone, but Apple service is deservedly legendary. I know anyone can have isolated anecdotes on either side, but I doubt anyone can argue about Apple's service. If I have to buy a used XL, I have no idea if the phone has a problem with the speaker or Bluetooth or call volume. Guess what that does the resale value. Google has got a long way to go before they should even dare to charge $870 for a 128GB XL. The Nexus 6P and the Nexus 5 were priced appropriately for the service provided by Google. Anything over $500, is overpriced for a phone from Google. Duder12 How do you not get that it was a marketing move? The price says it's competition to the iPhone. Had they launched the pixel 1 at a lower price it would have never recovered. Duder12 You don't. We do. Elsiedamado Google is paying 97$ per hour! Work for few hours & have longer with friends and family! !sg84c: On tuesday I got a great new Land Rover Range Rover from having earned $8752 this last four weeks.. Its the most-financialy rewarding I've had..

Cai Copley The price is crazy because due it's bland design, lack of innovation, lack of customer service, the fact updates may not extend beyond two years, no stores to buy from. Apple charges those prices because of the customer service, constant updates for 4+ years, etc so they have the cash flux to provide for that—people would rather pay a one time high price than continually pay a subscription service! Michael Hannigan I would rather continually pay for a subscription service, assuming it carries a substantial value. charlie Jason That case makes it look even more like an iPhone. Just saying. NooSH should be [Rape alert]* Margaritas Ante Porcos Is it obligatory here to say only nice things about that crap of a phone? because I have nothing but a middle finger to to this ugly overpriced underachiever. Gerardo Sarabia I don't love the design and it's far from perfect but it's still the best phone I've ever used. Michael Hannigan So you weren't able to get on, were you? Duder12 Best phone I've ever owned. putte40 If that phone could be available worldwide.... Marty Meh...I'd rather have either a Spigen or Supcase. Cowboydroid Both are massively overpriced. I'm curious to see sales stats. Me Are the cases backordered as well? matteventu Nobody wants their crappy cases. ro964 I entertained a Pixel XL purchase at one point, but never ever found stock available, save for one brief moment while speaking directly with a Project Fi customer service rep. Over time, my interest has evaporated. Today I'm using a Nexus 5X ($249) which is running Android 7.1.2 and costs me about $35/month on Project Fi. I'll take a look at the Pixel 2 whenever it's announced. If the features are what I'm looking for, maybe my interest will be renewed. For now, I'm happy with my N5X. seattle tech HAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHA RXG9 Google still charing $769? lol. I just got 2 Galaxy S8's for $750. (T-Mobile BOGO deal) Michael Hannigan Read the fine print, chump! Duder12 No kidding. Dumbass just locked himself into TMobile Luiz Marin After I got one for $15 on eBay to my pixel, I just in love with the silicone touch of it, Totally worth it Mako10 Google should stick to software, both of my nexus phones have been a joke. And with all the complaints about the pixel, they still cant get it right...and for $800 no less. Sorry but my next phone will either be a S8 or Note, or more likely an iphone. never thought id say the "i" word, but their stuff just works. Michael Hannigan It's been "a couple of months since the Pixel and Pixel XL debited"? Really? For me it's been over six months. LethalLunatic Probably does not understand the definition of "couple" Mark Conroy It's never even appeared on the Play store in Ireland, so no danger of it being overpriced in a country where Google have an enormous financial presence. Lindsay Meyer I have a Pixel, which was fortunately (or unfortunately) rather easy for me to acquire. But after reading about everyone who's been wanting one and can't get it, I would really like to say... Please, take mine. I would love my $800 back so I could go buy the Nexus 6 and spend the remaining 300 bucks on something else. Lots of cool stuff out there for $300. My husband has the Nexus 6, and let me tell you, it's very nearly the same damn phone as far as user experience is concerned. The Pixel is maybe like a $50 upgrade; I wouldn't pay more. Please don't let scarcity be the reason to try and get your hands on the Pixel, free case or not. You've been warned. Mix Petty much this! My wifes ZTE Axon 7 was 1/2 the price and has had less issues than my Pixel XL's have (I am on my 3rd one) My brother has had his Pixel XL for less than 4 months and he is already selling it. Not worth $1,340 CAD....not even close. Duder12 Yeah well same can't be said with last year's Nexus 6p and Nexus 5x. The Qualcomm processor in those phones make them an immediate no compared to the pixel. Fred #destocking Mix I have heard that these cases are utter garbage and $10 cases from Amazon are better quality. These are, apparently, super brittle and crack easily..... I would just wait as this isn't really a good deal.

Google Maps v9.53 brings back a setting for transit notifications and prepares for better-informed commutes [APK Teardown + Download] Cody Toombs Follow View All Posts 2017/05/15 6:06pm PDTMay 15, 2017 8 Plus 1 on G+ 28 Share on Facebook 38 Share on Twitter Total Shares74 APK Teardown Applications Downloads News Article Contents 1 What's New 1.1 Return of mass transit station notifications 2 Teardown 2.1 Traffic notifications for your commute 2.2 Set your method of travel for commutes 3 Download An update to Google Maps began rolling out over the weekend and this one appears to be focused on keeping people in the know on their commutes. This version brings back a toggle to control notifications about delays and interruptions at mass transit stations, and this time it might be here to stay. A teardown also shows we'll soon have traffic notifications for the commute between home and work and that more modes of travel will be respected besides just driving and mass transit. What's New Unofficial Changelog: (the stuff we found) Toggle for mass transit station information notifications (again?) Return of mass transit station notifications Users of Google Maps may recall a toggle was added to v9.49 a couple of months ago that gave users a choice about receiving notifications regarding mass transit stations. This was based on work that first appeared in a teardown last year in June, but there had been some changes in the meantime. Perhaps this happened earlier than intended and was was removed shortly afterward. It's back with v9.53 and could be here to stay. On the surface, nothing special has changed from the last time the toggle was added, and there have been similar settings even before that, but some new text seen through a teardown does suggest this implementation is a little more likely to be final. Along with the basic notification title and summary, there are also a few lines that go with the notifications. code <string name="TRANSIT_STATION_NOTIFICATION_SETTINGS_TITLE">Station information</string> <string name="TRANSIT_STATION_NOTIFICATION_SETTINGS_SUMMARY">Get departures and disruptions for nearby stations</string> <string name="TRANSIT_STATION_GENERIC_TERM">Transit Station</string> <string name="TRANSIT_STATION_MORE_DEPARTURES_AND_INFO">More departures and alerts</string> <string name="TRANSIT_STATION_NO_UPCOMING_DEPARTURES">No departures within the next hour</string> <string name="TRANSIT_STATION_WITH_PLATFORM">from Platform %s · %s</string> <string name="TRANSIT_STATION_NEXT_DEPARTURE">Next: %s</string> <receiver android:name="com.google.android.apps.gmm.transit.TransitStationBroadcastReceiver" android:exported="false"> <intent-filter> <action android:name="android.intent.action.BOOT_COMPLETED" /> <action android:name="android.intent.action.MY_PACKAGE_REPLACED" /> </intent-filter> </receiver> <receiver android:name="com.google.android.apps.gmm.transit.TransitStationService" android:exported="false" /> <service android:name="com.google.android.apps.gmm.transit.TransitDepartureBoardFetcherService" android:exported="true" android:permission="com.google.android.gms.permission.BIND_NETWORK_TASK_SERVICE"> <intent-filter> <action android:name="com.google.android.gms.gcm.ACTION_TASK_READY" /> </intent-filter> </service> Where things get a little more detailed is a new prompt that allows users to block notifications for stations that they don't need. In the previous teardown, individual lines – say for busses and subways – could be ignored, but this focuses on the stations, which often have their own distinct issues. <string name="TRANSIT_PER_STATION_BAN_NOTIFICATION_TITLE">Turn off notifications at this station?</string> <string name="TRANSIT_PER_STATION_BAN_NOTIFICATION_TEXT">%s</string> The most telling reason to think this feature is sticking around this time is the text from a pair of new notifications that ask users if they've visited a station and if the transit notifications are helpful to the user. The first is obviously there to gauge accuracy, but the second clearly shows the Maps team is seeking to judge the efficacy of these notifications. In the end, this may determine if they are successful or have to be adjusted. code <string name="TRANSIT_STATION_LOCATION_ACCURACY_NOTIFICATION_TITLE">Were you at this station?</string> <string name="TRANSIT_STATION_LOCATION_ACCURACY_NOTIFICATION_TEXT">%s</string> <string name="TRANSIT_STATION_LOCATION_ACCURACY_NOTIFICATION_RESPONSE_NO">No</string> <string name="TRANSIT_STATION_LOCATION_ACCURACY_NOTIFICATION_RESPONSE_YES">Yes</string> <string name="TRANSIT_STATION_USER_SATISFACTION_NOTIFICATION_TITLE">Are these notifications helpful?</string> <string name="TRANSIT_STATION_USER_SATISFACTION_NOTIFICATION_TEXT">Public transport departures and delays.</string> <string name="TRANSIT_STATION_USER_SATISFACTION_NOTIFICATION_RESPONSE_HELPFUL">Helpful</string> <string name="TRANSIT_STATION_USER_SATISFACTION_NOTIFICATION_RESPONSE_NOT_HELPFUL">Not Helpful</string> There are already some mass transit notifications in both Google Maps and the Google Now stream (or whatever it's being called these days), but this adds another nuance and might save some people from getting stuck somewhere because a station is effectively out of order. I don't live near any mass transit and triggering these notifications generally isn't possible if you're not jumping on a bus or train fairly often, so I'm not sure if these notifications are already operational with this update or if they're still in limbo until further notice. If anybody has started receiving them, let us know in the comments below. Teardown Disclaimer: Teardowns are based on evidence found inside of apks (Android's application package) and are necessarily speculative and usually based on incomplete information. It's possible that the guesses made here are totally and completely wrong. Even when predictions are correct, there is always a chance that plans could change or may be canceled entirely. Much like rumors, nothing is certain until it's officially announced and released. The features discussed below are probably not live yet, or may only be live for a small percentage of users. Unless stated otherwise, don't expect to see these features if you install the apk. Traffic notifications for your commute The Google app has been offering tips about commuting between home and work for a long time, perhaps going back to the initial launch of Google Now in 2012. Now in 2017, it looks like Google Maps is preparing to launch a similar feature of its own. The text taken from the apk is pretty straightforward, noting simply that it's a notification with real-time traffic conditions between your current location and either home or work. It actually sounds a lot like the real-time traffic information we already get, but in the form of a notification. code <string name="TRAFFIC_TO_PLACE_NOTIFICATION_SETTINGS_TITLE">Travel times</string> <string name="TRAFFIC_TO_PLACE_NOTIFICATION_SETTINGS_SUMMARY">See ETAs to home and work</string> <string name="TRAFFIC_TO_PLACE_NOTIFICATION_PROMO_TITLE">Beat the traffic on your commute</string> <string name="TRAFFIC_TO_PLACE_NOTIFICATION_PROMO_CONTENT">Get notifications about real-time traffic conditions, based on your current location</string> <string name="TRAFFIC_TO_PLACE_NOTIFICATION_PROMO_ACCEPT">Turn on</string> <string name="TRAFFIC_TO_PLACE_NOTIFICATION_PROMO_DECLINE">No thanks</string> <receiver android:name="com.google.android.apps.gmm.traffic.notification.service.DismissTrafficToPlaceNotificationReceiver"> <intent-filter> <action android:name="com.google.android.apps.gmm.traffic.notification.service.DismissTrafficToPlaceNotificationReceiver.NOTIFICATION_DISMISSED" /> </intent-filter> </receiver> <receiver android:name="com.google.android.apps.gmm.traffic.notification.service.TrafficToPlaceNotificationGeofenceReceiver"> <intent-filter> <action android:name="com.google.android.apps.gmm.traffic.notification.service.TrafficToPlaceNotificationGeofenceReceiver.ACTION_DISMISS" /> <action android:name="com.google.android.apps.gmm.traffic.notification.service.TrafficToPlaceNotificationGeofenceReceiver.ACTION_UPDATE" /> </intent-filter> </receiver> Why is this being added to Maps when the Google app already does it? I would assume it's there so all of these types of things can be managed in a single place. I doubt it will mean the commute care will be removed from Google Now. While this does create a redundancy between the two apps, it has the notable advantage of giving users some choice about how they would like to receive this information and in which form. Set your method of travel for commutes Google Maps has been very good about supporting different modes of travel for a long time. Google's Navigation feature is pretty great at giving directions whether you're walking, driving, cycling, or hopping onto mass transit. However, when it comes to commuting, it seems like there may have been some assumptions that everybody either drives or uses public transit. It looks like the Maps app wants to give users a little more control over that by allowing users to choose a mode of travel for their commutes. <string name="COMMUTE_CATEGORY_TITLE">Commute</string> <string name="COMMUTE_BASIC_TRAVEL_MODE_SETTINGS_TITLE">Mode of transport</string> <string name="COMMUTE_BASIC_TRAVEL_MODE_BIKING">Cycling</string> <string name="COMMUTE_BASIC_TRAVEL_MODE_DRIVING">Driving</string> <string name="COMMUTE_BASIC_TRAVEL_MODE_TRANSIT">Public transport</string> <string name="COMMUTE_BASIC_TRAVEL_MODE_WALKING">Walking</string> There's not enough information to go on to determine where this setting will show up or what it will be used for precisely. I also can't be sure if this is a single setting that's expected to be the majority of a user's commute or if it will relate to each leg of the trip (e.g. people that drive 20 minutes to a train, then ride for another 20 into a city). Still, there is more attention being paid to these other methods, which means more useful information for those that can use it.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 16 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Waymo’s Relationship with Uber Has Reached Point of No Return Shutterstock photo On Sunday night, Alphabet’s GOOGL Waymo and Lyft announced that they were in a partnership on self-driving technology that would give Waymo access to a network of travelers and Lyft access to leading self-driving technology. Lyft is a smaller Uber rival, having raised $600 million last month at a valuation of $7.5 billion. But it does have backing from General Motors, with which it has started testing its own self driving technology (still a fledgling effort unlike Uber’s Advanced Technologies Group). Google started out as more of a Uber partner, being the largest investor in the ride-hailing startup and powering its service with Google Maps. By virtue of its being the largest investor, Google also had an appointee on Uber’s board. Things started souring when Google developed its own self driving technology and showed signs of piggy-backing it to enter the ride hailing business rather than licensing it to its long-time partner. That’s when David Drummond, Google’s representative on Uber’s board, retired from the position. Since then, Google changed course, putting its automotive efforts under a company it calls Waymo and deciding to go with the licensing model after all. It’s currently testing its technology in Fiat Chrysler minivans. So the agreement with Lyft, the details of which remain undisclosed, potentially expands the list of testing partners and also applies the technology to the kind of use for which it might be consumed in high volume. This is particularly important because there is a big race between technology firms to get the technology out there first. So not just Google, but also Microsoft MSFT , Apple AAPL , Baidu, NVIDIA NVDA and Intel INTC are in the fray, developing the technology and partnering with traditional automakers to test it. Waymo also recently took Uber to court for using its former employee Anthony Levandowski to steal files related to its self-driving technology. Uber tried and failed to move the case to arbitration after Levandowski used the Fifth Amendment to refuse testimony. So the agreement with Lyft, which has reportedly been in the works for nearly a year, is also the final nail in the coffin as far as the Google-Uber relationship is concerned. 5 Trades Could Profit „Big-League” from Trump Policies If the stocks above spark your interest, wait until you look into companies primed to make substantial gains from Washington’s changing course.

Henderson Island is uninhabited, and lies far out in the South Pacific — east of New Zealand and west of Chile — some 3,100 miles (5,000 kilometres) from the nearest major land mass. This 9,100 acre (3,700 hectare) limestone atoll, one of the UK’s Pitcairn Islands — is prized for its biodiversity. But it is also littered with an estimated 37.7 million pieces of plastic, said the report in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, a peer-reviewed US journal. “Its location near the centre of the South Pacific Gyre ocean current makes it a focal point for debris carried from South America or deposited by fishing boats,” said the report. “We estimated a minimum of 3,570 debris items were deposited on North Beach daily, five orders of magnitude greater than the accumulation rates reported elsewhere.” About 27 per cent of the items were identifiable as being from South America, including beach equipment and fishing gear. The island is so remote that it is visited only once every five to 10 years for research purposes. It was during the most recent scientific expedition to the island in 2015 that researchers discovered the extent of the pollution problem. The beaches were found to be littered with between 21 and 671 items per square yard (metre), said researchers at the Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies (IMAS) at the University of Tasmania and the British conservation charity the Royal Society for the Preservation of Birds. — AFP-Relaxnews                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Albino orangutan named ‘Alba’ after global appeal Study shows ‘excess’ car pollution killed 38,000 in 2015 Chilean architecture firm Elemental wins Qatar’s Art Mill International Design Competition Plastic trash chokes remote South Pacific island Risk of heart attack spikes after flu, pneumonia, study shows Innovative new globe chess board brings new dimension to the game (VIDEO) Sex for fish: Women’s reluctant trade on Kenya’s Lake Victoria shore A new take on salt Adorable toddler shakes it when the beat drops (VIDEO) Hepatitis C nearly triples in US in five years Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: Oscars chief Boone Isaacs steps down from governors board Reuters Video: Trump revealed intelligence secrets to Russia, say officials Reuters Video: Artist creates tattoos you can hear Reuters Video: Cast and crew of ‘The Beguiled’ discuss the remake Reuters Video: Thai man murders baby, commits suicide on Facebook Live Tilda Swinton unveils strange ‘Okja’ promo clip Related Articles Disaster management: How prepared are we? — Tay Tian Yan MP: Budget cuts for DOE can affect measures to prevent river pollution Culprits behind Semenyih plant water pollution to be brought to book, minister says Rio’s water infected with ‘super bacteria’ (VIDEO) Making art out of pollution (VIDEO) Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

The new technology will be available in Volvo models within the next two years, offering a host of apps and services to owners. With the smartphone being such an integral item in our daily lives, Volvo’s move will take advantage of an established platform that is familiar with millions of users. Adding to that is access to a rich ecosystem with hundreds of apps, including popular ones like Google Maps and Spotify. “We are making an important strategic step with the Google partnership. Google’s platform and services will enhance the user experience by enabling more personalisation possibilities, while Android will offer increased flexibility from a development perspective,” said Henrik Green, senior vice president research and development at Volvo Car Group. “We’re thrilled to partner with Volvo to bring Android into their next generation connected cars. “This partnership gives us the opportunity to deliver a more seamless experience to Volvo drivers through a full-featured infotainment platform and rich ecosystem of Android applications and Google services,” added Patrick Brady, vice president of Android Engineering at Google. More details about Volvo and Google’s partnership will be announced later on during the Google I/O Conference on May 17. In a related matter, Volvo models will soon be updated to include Google Local Search, a location based service application. This will be released through an update to customers with Sensus Navigation.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Cars TECH Android Apple Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable MORE Entertainment Science Health Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Cars Tech   Android Apple Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable More   Entertainment Science Health Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search Galaxy S8 is still only second best to Pixel, says DxOMark JC Torres - May 15, 2017 1 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit The Google Pixel, the tech giant’s first ever “made by Google” phone, burst into the market with a shockingly good camera. So good that it has topped DxOMark’s charts months after its launch. If you expected that the most recent batch of new smartphones would be toppling it, think again. DxOMark has just given the Samsung Galaxy S8 an extensive testing and, while praiseworthy, the smartphone falls one point short of even tying with the Pixel. To its credit, Samsung’s flagships have generally done well on DxOMark’s charts, topping former king Sony and on par, sometimes even surpassing, Apple’s iPhones. But it seems that Samsung has finally met its match and might take another iteration before it can claim the crown again. That’s not to say that the Galaxy S8’s camera isn’t good. In fact, DxOMark does concede that it’s one of the best they’ve tested. But, as always, the devil is in the details. For example, the Galaxy S8 does great in low-light situations, reducing noise considerably. However, this comes at the expense of a slight loss of detail and sharpness, which may be acceptable, depending on your needs. Video recording is where the Galaxy S8 improved the most over its predecessor. Particularly, image stabilization has been improved even indoors. The tradeoff, however, comes in noise levels, which are particularly visible in low light. The Galaxy S8 earns an 88 in still photos and an equal 88 in video, with an average score of 88. That’s just one point shy of being on the same pedestal as the Google Pixel. Somewhat ironically, this does emphasize Google’s accomplishment even more, that it was able to achieve such high scores for less, like relying only on digital stabilization instead of OIS for non-shaky videos.

Businesses are still reeling from the fallout, and government agencies around the world are investigating. Security researchers have documented similarities between the WannaCry code and malware created by the North Korean hacking group called Lazarus Group. The code similarities were discovered by Google researcher Neel Mehta on Monday. Google declined to comment. The security firm Symantec also found links between the Lazarus Group and WannaCry. It discovered early versions of WannaCry on systems that had been compromised by the Lazarus Group’s tools. These versions were different than the ransomware that spread on Friday. It is unclear whether the Lazarus Group put the ransomware on those systems, or someone else did. “We have not yet been able to confirm the Lazarus tools deployed WannaCry on these systems,” a Symantec spokesperson said in a statement to CNNTech. “While these connections exist, they so far only represent weak connections. We are continuing to investigate for stronger connections.” Kaspersky Lab, a security company, has also published the similarities. The Lazarus Group was linked to the 2014 hack of Sony Pictures and attacks on banks around the world. The latest observations are still a long way from determining whether North Korean hackers were behind the recent global cyberattack, but they demonstrate how researchers go about finding who is to blame. One way is to investigate the code and compare it to samples that known hackers have used in the past. According to Amanda Rousseau, malware researcher at security firm Endgame, it’s difficult to catch cybercriminals. Further, it will be hard to find patient zero, or the first victim that kicked off the spread of the virus. The WannaCry ransomware took computers hostage by encrypting their files and requiring payment to unlock them. It leveraged a Windows vulnerability leaked in a trove of hacking tools believed to belong to the NSA. The ransomware mostly affects businesses and large organizations that use a Windows tool that enables file-sharing. Microsoft released a patch for the vulnerability in March. Rousseau says the malware code indicates there are at least two different parties responsible for it because there are two pieces of the attack that are coded differently. The ransomware itself was not hard to reverse engineer, she said, and indicates that a less experienced person wrote it. Multiple government agencies are committed to tracking down the perpetrators. Finding out who is responsible is called “attribution.” And it is very hard to do. Researchers look for certain identifiable pieces of code or clues on how it was executed, such as text strings or site registrations. But there are tools that hackers use to throw investigators off their tracks. Often, malware code is publicly available, or it can be purchased on digital black markets. According to Michael Flossman, researcher at security firm Lookout, examining the victims can help narrow down the perpetrators — but in the case of WannaCry, hundreds of thousands of machines were affected and there weren’t a ton of similarities in who was hit. The hackers responsible have not received much in return for their efforts. While the ransomware took down hospitals and critical infrastructure, it’s made less than $60,000 in ransom. Security researchers and government agencies have advised businesses not to pay the ransom. Researchers are piecing together where WannaCry came from, and some insight into how hackers used the leaked Microsoft vulnerabilities could be found on the dark web. The dark web is like a second layer of the internet beyond what average people use every day. It can only be accessed via the Tor browser, which gives users a cloak of anonymity and makes it impossible for anyone else to see their activity. Cybersecurity firm CYR3CON collects information from dark web sites and uses it to understand cybersecurity threats. In mid-April, the firm identified a conversation on a popular Russian forum that discussed using the leaked NSA exploits to launch ransomware attacks against hospitals. “The thing most interesting was a conversation that mentioned the specific Windows exploit,” Paulo Shakarian, cofounder and CEO of CYR3CON, told CNNTech. “It mentioned there were tens of thousands of systems that could be targeted, and many of them were in the medical industry.” Though there were many dark web conversations around the tools after they were released in April, this specific thread talked about a ransomware attack strikingly similar to WannaCry. It’s impossible to know who posted it, and it is not evidence that people who participated in the thread were responsible. But law enforcement and researchers can use this information to see what future attacks might look like so companies and users can defend themselves against hacks. “It can give insight into what malicious hackers are looking to target, what tools they will use, and what is the established expertise,” Shakarian said.

Google is building full-on Android for the car with Volvo and Audi Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/15 9:33am PDTMay 15, 2017 15 Plus 1 on G+ 78 Share on Facebook 50 Share on Twitter Total Shares143 Android Auto Android OS Google News Today Google has revealed more info on their new standalone Android platform for cars. Unlike Android Auto, which just casts info from your phone onto whatever software your vehicle maker has tossed together, the new system is based on Android and brings some of the same tools Android Auto had natively. Google revealed this initiative at last year's I/O, but there hasn't been much news apart from Chrysler's concept back at CES. Both Audi and Volvo will be making use of the new systems in future vehicles. Both Volvo and Audi appear to have been given a lot of leeway with the UI in the screenshots on Google's blog, things look to be skinned pretty heavily. If Google is allowing car makers that degree of flexibility, I wouldn't expect too much in the way of material design love when it lands in more cars. Even so, more tools and features from Android making their way into your car could come in handy, OEM-skin or not. Not to mention the utility of having some of the same features you did before via Auto without needing your phone around. Google revealed last year that they were thinking about the potential of bringing full Android to cars and showed off a prototype Maserati modified to run the experimental software at last year's I/O (Maserati was not involved, Google and Qualcomm shoehorned the tech into a car on their own). Google has been quiet since then about any news related to the new initiative, or any new names for the program. Given how close this is to I/O there is a good chance we'll hear more at Google's event. Source: Google Tags Android android auto audi cars vehicles volvo subscribe ...

JD In one of the security updates it'll stop my Exhaust from exhausting outside and instead in to the cabin. Don't worry tho it goes away after a reboot and doesn't affect all models. George Google's motto: let's abandon an OS/app/service before it becomes too popular by starting from scratch with another OS/app/service... TechGuy22 LOL you're going to have a ball at this year I/0 since so many shit going to be announced that will get killed off after 6 months George bro, it's been like that EVERY year... get wit the program lol makapav It really took form last year. Spaces, Allo, Duo. That was a whole bucket list. Dennis Ulijn I have a feeling Spaces was made just because they needed some centralized message board idea for I/O. Just in time for I/O and google never looked back... Months later when another app was coming out with the Spaces name they found out it was still alive. Drakenoid Spaces was pretty good, though now we've moved to Classroom and pretty sure it won't get shuttered because schools. Ryne Hager I gotta say this here, since I can't elsewhere. But, I used to think you were just a entertaining mild troll, but given your comments elsewhere I have come to see that you are the entertaining mild troll we need. Keep it up. Kawshik Ahmed At least in this Android never had a official 'Standalone In-Vehicle Infotainment' like QNX and Tizen. There are some unofficial attemps like Hyundai uses Android 2.3 and Honda uses Android4.2 in their car IVI. But this will much safer because Google is working with them. Shining Wing So what happens when the car stops receiving updates? One of the main reasons for Auto using your phone was that you only needed to worry about your phone and app being up-to-date, and phones are a lot more replaceable than cars when the updates stop. Kawshik Ahmed Do you know Hyundai Sonata cars run on Android 2.3 !!!!!! and Honda cars run on Android 4.2 ?? People don't panic about this cars because they don't know they are running Android and not just any Android very very old version of Android but those cars are all fine. Specialized OS's don't need updates. Aaron Anything that connects to the internet needs to be updated, at least for security purposes. And these systems will have to be connected at some level for Maps updates and messages. instinct Yes, people don't care because that's the norm. However, if in 2027 you are running a car with a ten year old OS and someone else is running a current OS, people may start to care. The big problem I see right now is that Android Auto now doesn't really seem to have any aftermarket products with really good screens. Ryne Hager That is an excellent question. I hope we get more info at I/O. syxbit When I bought my last TV, I deliberately got one without Android TV, because of the pathetic updates. I just purchased a Shield. I'm happy to buy a new Shield TV every 2-3 years, but I'm expecting my TV to last 5+ years. This is exactly what I'll do with my next car purchase. I'd rather the car just support the old Android Auto, so I can keep getting new phones every 1-2 years. I will never purchase a car with Android built in unless there's a clear promise of updates for MANY years. Ryne Hager I very much agree. Wait till you see my "What we use" post. I have a feeling you're gonna love it. marcusmarcus2 How often are the infotainment systems in cars updated now? If "Project Treble" comes into fruition, then it could actually improve infotainment system updates compared to current ones. Sean Leckie XDA? :) Suyash Bansal Maybe they could use the new update mechanism they are talking about Android O which makes it easier for manufacturers to update device. h4rr4r That will never get updated. The car should just display the phone screen. Jon Fridman I was going to buy a Volvo XC60 later this year, hopefully AA integration will work better than some other cars. It won't be the new version like they're working on, but at least it'll be there. Alexey Vasilyev I have Volvo XC60 MY14 running Sensus Connected Touch (Android 2.3). UI is very fluid. But I got a lot of problems. First Volvo want 400 EUR per year to keep iGO maps updated. I made a root and installed Waze - it works very good. But 3 years have passed (not a lot for cars) and now some features are not working. For example Liveradio app (which is just a list of radio URLs) is not working anymore - server shutdown. I think the best way for such systems is to use Mirrorlink. At least you can keep apps updated. JD Wooo Now I gotta get a new car every 2 years Bru [971] That's funny. Audi was reticent to add Android Auto support to it's cars Deeco "Car has unexpectedly stopped working" icyhotmike I bought a headunit with Dual bluetooth pairing, HD, Spotify, I Heart Radio, Pandora, every damn app.. built into it... for $99 (Kenwood KMM-BT318U) It even has an "Android" mode (no idea what it does) So don't waste your money Volvo and Audi Suyash Bansal That's not Android Auto. It's Android Open Accessory protocol (AOA) that lets you control phone-based content icyhotmike I got android auto app on my phone. marcusmarcus2 This would hav ebeen good news a couple years ago when I was hoping for my Nexus Lexus...Pixel ruined that dream. boop Auto may be the only extension of Android that Google's handled well. By making it an app it's not dependent on either the car or the phone for updates, you don't even need to buy a new car or head unit as you can just run it on your phone and, working under the assumption that this is built on O with Treble, updating the car itself shouldn't even be an issue (unlike all the Android TVs stuck on Marshmallow and the Watches still waiting on Wear 2.0). Paul Lemelin Harley needs to go in this direction and I don't care if it's an Android or iOS solution because their Harmon Kardon Infotainment system is the absolute WORST! Shahin iPhone users be like, "will it also come with lag, malware and inconsistent updates?" Suyash Bansal At least it'll work better compared to Apple's Carplay 😂 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeESbGPl_Dw Harsh patil Does this mean a slow death to Android Auto from now until such OS is lanuched? JG Tesla should be involved with this. They already have a big tablet installed front and center. And, from what I heard, Tesla had approached Google in regards to potentially using Android for their system. Google informed them Android wasn't, then, ready to be used in cars. But obviously now... It would allow Tesla to quickly add more apps available. Then you could use any music streaming service, without having to wait for Tesla to build the app for their platform.

A new report from XDA this evening details Google’s plans to adopt the Payment Request, a move that will be announced at Google I/O… Samsung U28E590D 28-Inch 4K Monitor Essentially, the Payment Request APU will allow users to pay in Chrome using third-party apps. This means that no longer will users have to go all the way through the checkout process and input credit card and bill information when trying to buy something. Instead, the website developers will be able to launch a third-party app such as a banking app or PayPal to quickly complete the checkout process. Support for the Payment Request API has been in Chromium since earlier this month, but Google will likely announce that Chrome will begin shipping with support for the API. However, there are several other steps before the Payment Request API will truly be useful. As outlined by XDA, both merchants and applications need to add support for the Payment Request API: In order to accomplish this task, web browsers must support the Payment Request API, online merchants need to support the API by implementing what’s called a Payment Method Identifier, and Android applications need to implement new services. Nevertheless, there’s a plethora of information already out there about the Payment Request API so ideally developers and website are already working to support the new platform. Much more technical information can be found in XDA’s full breakdown here.

Sign Up Your next Volvo or Audi may have an Android infotainment system If you happen to be at the Google I/O conference, you'll be able to check out demo cars from both automakers. Just don't call it Android Auto. Volvo Auto Tech by Andrew Krok May 15, 2017 1:11 PM PDT @andrewkrok In the near future, having Android in the car will mean more than carrying your phone in your pocket while going for a drive. Both Volvo and Audi will be relying on Android, Google's mobile operating system, for their next-generation infotainment offerings. The announcement is but one small tidbit due to come out of Google's I/O conference this week. You're probably somewhat familiar with Android Auto, which allows Android users to more easily access vital phone functions while behind the wheel. It gives the car's infotainment screen a simplified user interface, offering up a number of Android apps without requiring the owner to physically manipulate the phone. Enlarge Image Moving to Android doesn't necessarily mean that Sensus Connect will look much, if any different than it currently does. Volvo Volvo and Audi will be taking that one step further by basing their infotainment systems on Android. Audi's MMI infotainment system has been kicking around for years, but Volvo's Sensus Connect system is relatively new. This partnership doesn't mean the automakers will have to ditch their current setups entirely. Automakers can always recreate current interfaces, so buyers can remain comfortable -- this is just a foundation, so to speak. However, there are advantages to using Android as that foundation. Both Audi and Volvo, and any other automaker that uses Android, will have access to a vast library of current and future Android applications, whether the developer is Google, the automaker or a third party. Third-party app development for infotainment systems is hit or miss, depending on the automaker, but using Android should change that. "With the advent of Android, we will embrace a rich ecosystem while keeping our iconic Volvo user interface. We will offer hundreds of popular apps and the best integrated experience in this broad, connected environment," said Henrik Green, SVP of research and development at Volvo, in a statement. Volvo users won't have to wait until the next generation of Sensus Connect to take advantage of this partnership. Volvo will add Google Local Search to its slate of current cars equipped with Sensus Navigation through an update. If you happen to be at Google I/O this week, both Audi and Volvo will have infotainment demonstrations available, so you can get a better idea of what these automakers hope to achieve. 69 2018 Volvo XC60 takes everything good about XC90 and shrinks it down Share your voice 0 comments Tags Google I/O 2017 Volvo Audi Auto Tech Audi Google Volvo CNET First Take 2018 Volvo XC60 The XC60 is a hot ticket and makes up some 30 percent of Volvo's global sales.

Uber brawl sees 'suspicious' acts and 'pilfered files' The judge rules Uber's self-driving car program safe, for now, but also says its star engineer must step aside. All this and we haven't even gotten to trial. Tech Industry by Dara Kerr May 15, 2017 4:58 PM PDT @darakerr Uber's self-driving car program is safe ... for now. James Martin/CNET One thing is clear in the Waymo vs. Uber lawsuit: It's complicated. Federal Judge William Alsup sort of, kind of sided with Uber when he ruled Monday not to shutter the company's self-driving car program. But in almost the same breath, Alsup sort of, kind of sided with Waymo by agreeing that something "highly suspicious" happened with Uber's star engineer Anthony Levandowski. But let's back up. How did we get here? In February, Waymo, the self-driving car unit of Google's parent company Alphabet, filed a lawsuit against Uber alleging trade secret theft. Levandowski is at the center of the suit, with Waymo accusing him of stealing 14,000 "highly confidential" files on self-driving car technology in December 2015. Levandowski used to work at Google but quit in January 2016 to form his own self-driving truck startup, called Otto. Uber bought Otto last August for $680 million and named Levandowski head of its self-driving car program. Before Levandowski quit Google, he helped pioneer the company's autonomous vehicle program and develop its lidar technology, a key component in self-driving cars that lets vehicles "see" their surroundings and detect traffic, pedestrians, bicyclists and other obstacles. It's that lidar technology that's at the crux of the Waymo v. Uber lawsuit. Waymo claims Uber colluded with Levandowski to steal its lidar designs. Those designs, Waymo argues, have benefited Uber's driverless car tech. Uber argues that its lidar technology is "fundamentally different" from Waymo's. Self-driving cars are a hot topic in the auto and tech industries. Automakers from Toyota to Ford to Volvo all have projects under way. Besides Google and Uber, other Silicon Valley giants, including Apple, Intel and Tesla Motors, are betting on the tech. These vehicles aren't making money yet, but that could soon change. Once thought of as far-off future tech, driverless vehicles could be cruising city streets within the next 10 years, transforming the multitrillion-dollar auto industry. Google started working on self-driving cars in 2009 and has now test-driven its vehicles nearly 3 million miles. Uber launched its self-driving project in 2015 and has since rolled out autonomous vehicles on city streets in Pennsylvania, California and Arizona. What does the judge say? Judge Alsup said Uber can keep its project alive in the three states where it's operating, but that it must formally remove Levandowski as the head of the program. Uber also has to create a timeline of events regarding Levandowski being hired and "do whatever it can to ensure that its employees return 14,000-plus pilfered files to their rightful owner." In anticipation of the judge's ruling, Levandowski said last month he'd step aside as head of Uber's driverless car program and recuse himself from all lidar-related work. He remains at the company, however. "We are pleased with the court's ruling that Uber can continue building and utilizing all of its self-driving technology, including our innovation around LiDAR," an Uber spokeswoman wrote in an email. "We look forward to moving toward trial and continuing to demonstrate that our technology has been built independently from the ground up." Waymo didn't respond to requests for comment. Waymo had asked for a preliminary injunction, basically requesting that the judge shut down Uber's self-driving project. But that's easier said than done. Waymo needed to prove two things: it would suffer irreparable harm if the injunction wasn't granted and that Uber used the files Levandowski allegedly downloaded. While Waymo wasn't able to meet the bar on those two points, the evidence the company has brought forward so far convinced Alsup that something shady happened. Related stories Waymo vs. Uber lawsuit: 10 things you need to know Uber says it's not 'hiding anything' in Waymo case 11 juicy details revealed at the Waymo v. Uber hearing "Waymo has made a strong showing that Levandowski absconded with over 14,000 files from Waymo, evidently to have them available to consult on behalf of Otto and Uber," Judge Alsup wrote in his order on Monday. "Uber knew or at least should have known of the downloading but nevertheless proceeded to bring Levandowski and Otto on board." Alsup referred the case to federal prosecutors last week for a possible criminal investigation into the alleged theft of trade secrets. The Department of Justice has already opened an inquiry into Uber on its secretive "Greyball" software tool. If the DOJ decides to take the trade secrets case, prosecutors will likely look into Uber as a whole, said Phil Bezanson, attorney for the firm Bracewell. In its investigations, the DOJ tends to stress things like corporate culture, tone at the top and being a good corporate citizen, he said. "Do we just have two disconnected data points from Greyball to Levandowski's actions?" Bezanson said the government will be asking. "Or is this a larger corporate culture problem?"

At last year’s event, Google announced the launch of Google Home, their smart speaker device which allows users to interact with Google’s personal assistant service, known as Google Assistant. Many have been expecting that major updates to the device will be announced at this year’s annual event, which takes place in Mountain View, California. Developers at XDA have taken a look at the APK file of the latest update to the Google Home app and it’s suggested that there is a string which appears to add reminder controls, among other new features. Reminder controls is something that many users have likely felt is a long-overdue feature to the platform. According to XDA, it appears that the new reminder function may be accessed in a similar manner to the Home Control, Shopping, and Music functions within the app’s slide out menu. This latest update to the app, which is version 2.3, also appears to show that support for some other features has also been added. Following the recent launch of the Google Assistant SDK, it appears that support for third-party Google Assistant devices will become available. This means that Google Assistant may be available in other smart home speakers in the future, such as the Spot speakers produced by NVIDIA. Another new feature which appears to be in the latest update is cloud casting. Up until now, casting has only been possible with Google Chromecast when devices are placed close together or are both on the same network. This latest update to the Google Home app appears to suggest that casting media such as photos, videos, and music will now be possible from further afield, outside the local network. This could prove a very useful update, although it is not known at this time, of course, whether this feature will actually be seen. It is also unclear how this would work in practice. All of these new features are not currently part of a live build and could be reconsidered or tweaked by Google at any time, meaning they may not appear in a future release at all. That said, if Google has plans to introduce them this week’s event would be a good place to make an announcement.

Alexa can now double-check if you actually said a wake word Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/15 12:54pm PDTMay 15, 2017 4 Plus 1 on G+ 8 Share on Facebook 33 Share on Twitter Total Shares45 News My Google Home isn't the best at figuring out if me (or someone else) actually says "Hey Google" or "OK Google." Sometimes I'll be watching a video where no one says anything remotely similar to those phrases, and the lights on my Home flip on. But I have noticed that most of the time, the lights turn off a split-second later, as the Home actually realizes that no one called for it (presumably once the voice clip is processed by Google's servers). Amazon appears to be giving Alexa a similar ability, with the introduction of 'Cloud-based wake word verification.' Essentially, any device with Alexa already listens for a wake word with the Wake Word Engine (WWE). But now, an additional cloud-based check verifies the phrase. If the second check thinks it was an accidental trigger, it will tell the device to close the audio stream and turn off the voice indicator. Manufacturers will have to update their Alexa-equipped devices to use the new verification, but Amazon has tried to make the process as painless as possible. The new Ecobee4 smart themostat is the first generally-available product using this new feature.

StealthEdge We've all seen and know what Bruce Wayne is doing. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQNeqeVpHF0 ericshmerick What people don't realize with Alexa and Google Home is you don't have to pause after saying the wake word. Basically everyone goes "Alexa....pauses for a second" then speaks. It's always listening for the wake word, so you can just rip off a continuous normal speed request all at once. So like "OK Google what's the weather like" with zero pause. Just say the request without any delay at all, even very fast. It'll catch it. I dunno, peeve of mine I guess. Max Gromada That pause is a habit of talking to humans. Why wouldn't Alexa answer "YES, MY LORD" every time you call it? H. You usually wait to see the light or hear the peep as confirmation that it is listening. Because at least for me she reacts maybe 2 times out of 3 to being called.

From the farthest corners of the world, visitors will be able to stroll the elegant museum's familiar galleries and halls, stop, read up and move on. Kolkata's must-visit tourist attraction will go completely digital on May 18, the day the worldwide community of museums will celebrate as International Museum Day. The project is the result of a tie-up between Victoria Memorial and Google. The latter is bringing alive a virtual 360-degree walk through the memorial's galleries in Google Street View mode. It will be part of Google Arts and Culture, the inter net giant's online platform that allows visitors to access high-resolution images of artwork housed inside partner museums, either by walking through the museums or just static visits to designated collections. The ministry of culture has given formal permission to the Victoria Memorial authorities to allow Google to de sign this virtual tour, paying attention to every detail of artwork on permanent display and even those that are preserved in the reserve collection of the museum. Google has finished digitizing all six famed groundfloor halls -Portrait Gallery, Entrance Hall, Central Hall, Prince Hall, Durbar Hall (famous for its larger-than-lifesized oil paintings) and Calcutta Gallery -and is ready to go live on Thursday. This will be the third museum in the country run by the ministry of culture to go virtual, the first two being the National Museum and the National Gallery of Modern Art, both in New Delhi. Along with the digital walk on the ground floor, there are three prized collections of Victoria Memorial that have also been digitized and will be on view at Google Arts and Culture -paintings by Abanindranath Tagore, Gaganendranath Tagore and those by Thomas and William Daniell, famous across the world as Company paintings. Victoria Memorial has a collection of 72 Daniells, the largest in the world. "These are iconic paintings because they were done between 1770 and 1850. These were pre-camera era. Naturally, we get to see a large part of India that exists no more through these paintings. Take for example the painting that shows a panoramic view of the place we now know as Esplanade, complete with the Raj Bha van as it originally looked, without the dome," said memorial curator Jayanta Sengupta, adding that nearly 300 Abanindranath and 200 Gaganendranath paintings will also be on virtual view. Coveted paintings of Aban Tagore like `Bharat Mata', the `Passing of Shah Jahan', the `Chandi Mangal' collection and `Krishna Leela', which are considered to be gems from the Bengal school, will now be viewed at will, just as masterpieces of Gaganendranath who brought concepts like cubism and satire to life through his paintings. "Victoria Memorial has a vast collection of which we can keep just 13% on display because of lack of space. The remaining stays in our vaults away from view. With this facility, now our entire collection will gradually be on virtual display," Sengupta said. Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.

[Photo: Flickr user Kenneth Lu] By Mark Sullivan4 minute Read This Wednesday and Thursday, Google is holding its annual developer shindig, I/O. The conference will turn the Shoreline Ampitheatre near the company’s headquarters in Mountain View, Calif. into an amusement park for nerds. With any luck, CEO Sundar Pichai won’t lead off on a dark note, as Mark Zuckerberg did by acknowledging a murder shared on Facebook at Facebook F8 and Satya Nadella did by referencing the possibility of technology leading us into an Orwellian future at Microsoft’s Build. advertisement Pichai will likely have much sunnier things to say about his company’s work in artificial intelligence and how it’s finding its way into all sorts of products. The company’s main challenge this year is maintaining the excitement it generated–in tech circles, at least–with last year’s I/O announcements. It will be a hard act to follow: At I/O 2016, Google announced the Google Assistant AI service, a new VR platform called Daydream, a smart speaker called Home, and new messaging and video-call apps known as Allo and Duo, respectively. At this year’s I/O, Google could fill its keynote and other sessions only with news about these products and have a worthehile event. But announcing incremental improvements is never as sexy as announcing wholly new platforms. It’ll be interesting to see how the company divides the keynote time between platform updates and completely new matters. Here’s what to watch for: Google Assistant, One Year Later The company will almost certainly announce some new tricks for its virtual Assistant–Google’s answer to Amazon’s Alexa, Apple’s Siri, and Microsoft’s Cortana. These new capabilities will likely relate to expanded subject-area knowledge and greater sensory awareness and communicativeness. We may hear about advances in image-recognition technology, voice recognition, and comprehension. The Allo messaging app announced at last year’s I/O hasn’t exactly proved world-changing, which may be an indication that its Assistant skills need broadening. Google will likely talk about all the places Assistant is showing up–in the home, the car, and beyond–and announce some new ones. But as Axios‘s Ina Fried points out, Google also has some work to do to make it clear to developers and the public just what Assistant is. Is it more like Siri, which is core to to iOS and provides AI and natural-language features for numerous Apple platforms? Or is it more like Amazon’s Alexa, which can power third-party devices, too? Google Assistant For iOS One rumor du jour (from Android Police) says that Google will be announcing a full-on Assistant app for the iPhone. Assistant already lives inside Google’s Allo iOS app, but the scuttlebutt says the new standalone app will both include a chat interface and support voice commands. A Brainier Google Photos Chances are very high that Google will update its Photos app, very likely with some new artificial intelligence features. Details are scarce on this one. advertisement Virtual Reality A session on I/O day 2 with Google’s head of VR, Clay Bavor, will feature Google’s VR initiatives, including its Daydream VR headset and platform and the YouTube VR content channel. Google might even announce new third-party Daydream headsets (or new phones that power them). … And Augmented Reality That day-two session will also cover Google’s Project Tango augmented-reality technology, which superimposes digital imagery onto real-world imagery as seen through the lenses and sensors of a tablet or smartphone. There’s a good chance we’ll see more Tango-enabled devices announced. (Lenovo was first out with a Tango phone last year in its Phab 2 Pro, which uses a 16-megapixel rear camera and four depth-sensing cameras to support Tango’s 3D augmented-reality experience.) As we saw Microsoft do at last week’s Build, Google may take steps at I/O to unify its AR and VR efforts into a “mixed reality” story. The current Daydream VR headsets are a completely occluded experience (you can’t see the outside world at all), while AR experiences depend on melding digital imagery with your physical surroundings. Because some tech companies view VR as a limited opportunity, while seeing AR as potentially more popular with users, there’s a drive to combine the two technologies into a single headset and controllers. This would require a new hardware design, something there’s an outside chance we’ll see at I/O. The Evolution Of Google Home Another embodiment of Assistant is the Google Home smart speaker device, which Google launched at last year’s I/O as its answer to Amazon’s Echo. The company may be ready to release the follow-up with some new features. It’ll almost certainly announce more ways that third-party developers can use Home as an end point for their apps or services. At present, Amazon is the company to beat in the smart-speaker wars, and it has added new skills and integrations for the connected home at a furious pace over the past year. The Next Version Of Android Google has already released a preview of its next OS to developers. Expect the company to spend a good deal of keynote time detailing the upgrade’s capabilities. So far, we know that Android O adds features such as icons that move and adapt to their environment, picture-in-picture video, and form auto-fill functions. Google In The Car In 2014, the tech giant introduced Android Auto, a system that lets people project content from their Android smartphones to their car’s in-dashboard screen. The software now runs on 300 car models. Bloomberg‘s Mark Gurman and Mark Bergen report that Google will have some Audi Q8 and Volvo V90 SUVs at I/O to demonstrate a new Android-flavored OS built just for automobile touch-screen systems. This new OS resides in the vehicle rather than getting its smarts from an Android phone.

(Dan Gessner) BY Kyle Campbell NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Monday, May 15, 2017, 9:00 PM It was another manic Monday here at the Daily News Autos with news aplenty from the auto industry’s new Big Three. I’m talking, of course, about Tesla, Google and Uber. FOLLOW DAILY NEWS AUTOS ON FACEBOOK. ‘LIKE’ US HERE. Like so many days in this modern era of automobiles, today’s biggest headlines were not about body design or engine output; they were all about technological advancements and the race toward automation. We’ve got Uber and Google squabbling in court over proprietary data, Waymo and Lyft joining forces, Elon Musk’s underground tunnel and more in this Monday edition of the Daily Drive-Thru. NEWS: Maven launches in New York City A Chevrolet Volt available through the Maven app charges at The Art House in Jersey City, New Jersey. (Kyle Campbell) Maven, General Motors’ car-sharing service, is the latest such company to set up shop. Announcing its presence by ringing the opening bell on the New York Stock Exchange, Maven debuted with 80 vehicles and several locations scattered throughout Manhattan between Columbia University and the Bowery. Unlike other car-sharing services, Maven does not charge a membership fee and it offers a variety of SUVs and midsize sedans in addition to its compact car lineup. Reservations can be made using the Maven app as little as an hour before use. Read how Maven stacks up against other services here. Uber, Google clash in court; Waymo, Lyft partner up Waymo will introduce the world to its self-driving Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid minivan at the North American International Auto Show. (Fiat Chrysler Automobiles) A U.S. District Court Judge in San Francisco ruled that Uber had to return confidential information back to Waymo, Google’s self-driving car research team. The ruling stemmed from a lawsuit filed by Waymo claiming that a former engineer pilfered proprietary information when he left the Alphabet Inc. subsidiary to start his own company. To make matters worse for Uber, Waymo also partnered with the ride-hailing company’s chief competitor, Lyft. This gives Lyft a second source for autonomous technology, adding to its existing partnership with General Motors. Read more about the judge’s ruling here. Volvo, Google partner for Android infotainment screen Volvo has announced its collaboration with Google to develop a next generation infotainment system built around the Android operating system. Those who enjoy the Android Auto projection interface are really going to dig Google’s next big contribution to vehicle technology: an Android-powered infotainment system. The Silicon Valley giant has partnered with Volvo with the goal of making a vehicle display as responsive and user-friendly as a smartphone. Volvo hopes to introduce the new system, which will be built on Android’s 7.0 Nougat operating system, within the next two years. Read more about this partnership here. Elon Musk’s new venture might make you sick Tesla CEO Elon Musk has been working on his latest venture, “The Boring Company” to reduce Los Angeles traffic. (Ringo H.W. Chiu/AP) Evil genius/tech messiah Elon Musk is tired of sitting in Los Angeles. So sick of it, in fact, that he founded the Boring Company, a construction firm tasked with digging a giant underground tunnel system to transport cars at high speeds. Don’t believe me? Well, good thing there’s video. Musk shared test footage of an electric sled that will transport cars at speeds of up to 125 mph under the streets of L.A., fast enough to travel from Westwood to Los Angeles International Airport (normally a 40-minute trip) in 5 minutes. The Tesla chief executive posted the footage on Instagram with a cautionary caption warning of potential seizures and motion sickness. Check out the video here. BUYING ADVICE: 5 to Drive: Best luxury performance cars of 2017 If you're looking for the best luxury performance cars, these 5 DNA winners won't let you down. (Porsche) As you may well know, we’ve been breaking down our list of Daily News Autos recommended vehicles for the past several weeks. In that time we’ve dissected 14 categories, but none are likely to be as salivated over as the one we bring you today. Yes, today we bring you the vehicles that everybody cares about but nobody can afford: luxury performance cars, some of which come dangerously close to our $100,000 cutoff while others steer well clear of it. The sultry Alfa Romeo Giulia took this category, but the runners-up put up a darn good fight. See our list of recommended luxury performance cars here. REVIEWS Short Report: 2017 Ford Fusion Energi Shown here in the new Platinum trim level, the 2017 Ford Fusion Titanium can be optioned with these handsome 18-inch aluminum wheels. (Ford Motor Company) As people who spend far too much time driving in, writing about and discussing cars, the members of the Daily News Autos staff are occasionally asked to perform our professional duty of recommending a vehicle to someone in a non-professional setting; namely to a family member or friend. Here, Christian Wardlaw relives how one such recommendation of the Ford Fusion Energi backfired. He also explains why, if he was put in the same position, he’d still probably endorse it. Read his short report on the Fusion Energi here. GALLERIES 2017 Mazda CX-9: small changes, big value After a complete redesign in 2016, Mazda has kept its XC-9 SUV largely the same for the 2017 model year, only making its Smart City Brake Support system standard on the Touring model. But with good looks, a comfortable interior and a fun engine, it really didn’t need to do anything else. 10 photos view gallery Gallery: 2017 Mazda CX-9 Photos EXTRAS Video: 3-year-old teaches you how to change oil How many extra cookies do you think she charges for labor? Don’t know how to change your oil? Well, lucky for you the “Little How to Girl” is here to show you how it’s done. As someone who’s never actually changed his own oil, I have to say, it’s pretty embarrassing to be upstaged by a 3-year-old.

Google is building full-on Android for the car with Volvo and Audi Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/15 9:33am PDTMay 15, 2017 15 Plus 1 on G+ 78 Share on Facebook 50 Share on Twitter Total Shares143 Android Auto Android OS Google News Today Google has revealed more info on their new standalone Android platform for cars. Unlike Android Auto, which just casts info from your phone onto whatever software your vehicle maker has tossed together, the new system is based on Android and brings some of the same tools Android Auto had natively. Google revealed this initiative at last year's I/O, but there hasn't been much news apart from Chrysler's concept back at CES. Both Audi and Volvo will be making use of the new systems in future vehicles. Both Volvo and Audi appear to have been given a lot of leeway with the UI in the screenshots on Google's blog, things look to be skinned pretty heavily. If Google is allowing car makers that degree of flexibility, I wouldn't expect too much in the way of material design love when it lands in more cars. Even so, more tools and features from Android making their way into your car could come in handy, OEM-skin or not. Not to mention the utility of having some of the same features you did before via Auto without needing your phone around. Google revealed last year that they were thinking about the potential of bringing full Android to cars and showed off a prototype Maserati modified to run the experimental software at last year's I/O (Maserati was not involved, Google and Qualcomm shoehorned the tech into a car on their own). Google has been quiet since then about any news related to the new initiative, or any new names for the program. Given how close this is to I/O there is a good chance we'll hear more at Google's event. Source: Google Tags Android android auto audi cars vehicles volvo subscribe ...

JD In one of the security updates it'll stop my Exhaust from exhausting outside and instead in to the cabin. Don't worry tho it goes away after a reboot and doesn't affect all models. George Google's motto: let's abandon an OS/app/service before it becomes too popular by starting from scratch with another OS/app/service... TechGuy22 LOL you're going to have a ball at this year I/0 since so many shit going to be announced that will get killed off after 6 months George bro, it's been like that EVERY year... get wit the program lol makapav It really took form last year. Spaces, Allo, Duo. That was a whole bucket list. Dennis Ulijn I have a feeling Spaces was made just because they needed some centralized message board idea for I/O. Just in time for I/O and google never looked back... Months later when another app was coming out with the Spaces name they found out it was still alive. Drakenoid Spaces was pretty good, though now we've moved to Classroom and pretty sure it won't get shuttered because schools. Ryne Hager I gotta say this here, since I can't elsewhere. But, I used to think you were just a entertaining mild troll, but given your comments elsewhere I have come to see that you are the entertaining mild troll we need. Keep it up. Kawshik Ahmed At least in this Android never had a official 'Standalone In-Vehicle Infotainment' like QNX and Tizen. There are some unofficial attemps like Hyundai uses Android 2.3 and Honda uses Android4.2 in their car IVI. But this will much safer because Google is working with them. Shining Wing So what happens when the car stops receiving updates? One of the main reasons for Auto using your phone was that you only needed to worry about your phone and app being up-to-date, and phones are a lot more replaceable than cars when the updates stop. Kawshik Ahmed Do you know Hyundai Sonata cars run on Android 2.3 !!!!!! and Honda cars run on Android 4.2 ?? People don't panic about this cars because they don't know they are running Android and not just any Android very very old version of Android but those cars are all fine. Specialized OS's don't need updates. Aaron Anything that connects to the internet needs to be updated, at least for security purposes. And these systems will have to be connected at some level for Maps updates and messages. instinct Yes, people don't care because that's the norm. However, if in 2027 you are running a car with a ten year old OS and someone else is running a current OS, people may start to care. The big problem I see right now is that Android Auto now doesn't really seem to have any aftermarket products with really good screens. Ryne Hager That is an excellent question. I hope we get more info at I/O. syxbit When I bought my last TV, I deliberately got one without Android TV, because of the pathetic updates. I just purchased a Shield. I'm happy to buy a new Shield TV every 2-3 years, but I'm expecting my TV to last 5+ years. This is exactly what I'll do with my next car purchase. I'd rather the car just support the old Android Auto, so I can keep getting new phones every 1-2 years. I will never purchase a car with Android built in unless there's a clear promise of updates for MANY years. Ryne Hager I very much agree. Wait till you see my "What we use" post. I have a feeling you're gonna love it. marcusmarcus2 How often are the infotainment systems in cars updated now? If "Project Treble" comes into fruition, then it could actually improve infotainment system updates compared to current ones. Sean Leckie XDA? :) Suyash Bansal Maybe they could use the new update mechanism they are talking about Android O which makes it easier for manufacturers to update device. h4rr4r That will never get updated. The car should just display the phone screen. Jon Fridman I was going to buy a Volvo XC60 later this year, hopefully AA integration will work better than some other cars. It won't be the new version like they're working on, but at least it'll be there. Alexey Vasilyev I have Volvo XC60 MY14 running Sensus Connected Touch (Android 2.3). UI is very fluid. But I got a lot of problems. First Volvo want 400 EUR per year to keep iGO maps updated. I made a root and installed Waze - it works very good. But 3 years have passed (not a lot for cars) and now some features are not working. For example Liveradio app (which is just a list of radio URLs) is not working anymore - server shutdown. I think the best way for such systems is to use Mirrorlink. At least you can keep apps updated. JD Wooo Now I gotta get a new car every 2 years Bru [971] That's funny. Audi was reticent to add Android Auto support to it's cars Deeco "Car has unexpectedly stopped working" icyhotmike I bought a headunit with Dual bluetooth pairing, HD, Spotify, I Heart Radio, Pandora, every damn app.. built into it... for $99 (Kenwood KMM-BT318U) It even has an "Android" mode (no idea what it does) So don't waste your money Volvo and Audi Suyash Bansal That's not Android Auto. It's Android Open Accessory protocol (AOA) that lets you control phone-based content icyhotmike I got android auto app on my phone. marcusmarcus2 This would hav ebeen good news a couple years ago when I was hoping for my Nexus Lexus...Pixel ruined that dream. boop Auto may be the only extension of Android that Google's handled well. By making it an app it's not dependent on either the car or the phone for updates, you don't even need to buy a new car or head unit as you can just run it on your phone and, working under the assumption that this is built on O with Treble, updating the car itself shouldn't even be an issue (unlike all the Android TVs stuck on Marshmallow and the Watches still waiting on Wear 2.0). Paul Lemelin Harley needs to go in this direction and I don't care if it's an Android or iOS solution because their Harmon Kardon Infotainment system is the absolute WORST! Shahin iPhone users be like, "will it also come with lag, malware and inconsistent updates?" Suyash Bansal At least it'll work better compared to Apple's Carplay 😂 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeESbGPl_Dw Harsh patil Does this mean a slow death to Android Auto from now until such OS is lanuched? JG Tesla should be involved with this. They already have a big tablet installed front and center. And, from what I heard, Tesla had approached Google in regards to potentially using Android for their system. Google informed them Android wasn't, then, ready to be used in cars. But obviously now... It would allow Tesla to quickly add more apps available. Then you could use any music streaming service, without having to wait for Tesla to build the app for their platform.

Netflix confirms it is blocking rooted/unlocked devices, app itself is still working (for now) Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/13 3:08pm PDTMay 13, 2017 229 Plus 1 on G+ 1077 Share on Facebook 394 Share on Twitter Total Shares1700 Applications News Earlier today, Netflix started showing up as 'incompatible' on the Play Store for rooted and unlocked Android devices. However, the app itself continued to work fine, leading some (including myself) to think it could have been an accident. However, Netflix has now confirmed to us that blocking modified devices from downloading the app was intentional. This is the full statement: With our latest 5.0 release, we now fully rely on the Widevine DRM provided by Google; therefore, many devices that are not Google-certified or have been altered will no longer work with our latest app and those users will no longer see the Netflix app in the Play Store. If you're not familiar with it, Widevine is a Google-made DRM technology that works across various desktop and mobile platforms. Widevine categorizes devices into three security levels, ranging from all processes running in the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) to not running anything in TEE at all. However, the Play Store listing seems tied to a device's SaftetyNet status (which is used by Android Pay), rather than the Widevine TEE. For example, Artem's bootloader-unlocked stock Pixel is still on Widevine Level 1, the most secure level, but fails SafetyNet because it is unlocked. The update's changelog also confirms the: "Version 5.0 only works with devices that are certified by Google and meet all Android requirements." What isn't exactly clear is why only the Play store listing is blocked, but the app itself continued to function normally. I tried both Netflix 4.16 and 5.0.4 (the latest version, from today), and both worked without problems on my unlocked and rooted Galaxy Tab S (which is labeled as Widevine Security Level 3). Maybe at some point the app will stop working, but that does not appear to be the case right now. If you have a blocked device, I recommend following the Pushbullet channel for Netflix on APKMirror (click the Pushbullet button on that page) so you can continue to receive updates outside the Play Store.

First the vpn's now this... why oh why??? Jimk4003 Surely because licensing is regionally specific, and because rooting has the potential to defeat DRM. I get that it might be annoying for some people, but aren't the reasons obvious? David Juarez But root?? Lol Semianonymous Probably an effort to reduce Region spoofing? Idk how easy that is to do on a stock device. Jimk4003 Because rooting has the potential to defeat DRM. mjh49783ab DRM doesn't work. All DRM does is inconvenience the end user. Jimk4003 Possibly. But Netflix have to negotiate licencing deals with the movie studios, and having DRM helps reassure the studios that the movies they have spent millions of dollars making aren't going to get stolen off Netflix without any attempt to stop it. mjh49783ab One could make the argument that rooting the phone may compromise the DRM. But blocking users from unlocking their phones to switch carriers? That is total bullshit, and is just the sort of thing that encourages users to pirate the content. Jimk4003 Netflix are blocking you from switching carriers? lomsha Sim unlocked phones are fine, unlocked bootloaders are blocked. mjh49783ab They didn't exactly make that clear in the article when I last read it. h4rr4r The studios need to reconsider blu rays then. Way easier to rip. Nothing they do will stop piracy. This kind of thing actually encourages it. Jimk4003 Maybe studios do need to consider Blu-ray's. That isn't Netflix's problem though. h4rr4r No Netflix problem is making sure they don't let the studios reduce the value of their product. If Amazon video works on my devices and Netflix does not that is a big deal to me. In that case I might as well sign up for more addon channels on Amazon with the mkney that currently goes to Netflix. Jimk4003 Agreed. But the studios are responsible for making the product they redistribute. It's certainly a balancing act, and I can see both sides of the argument, but Netflix isn't an inalienable right, and those who don't meet the T&C's are going to miss out. h4rr4r Sure, but the studios and Netflix are going to create pirates with these kind of actions. People aren't going to miss out. They will just pirate what they can't get legally. Jimk4003 Sure, but again, it's a tiny fraction of users. If Netflix can negotiate better terms with studios by blocking rooted devices, and thus improve their business overall at the expense of a few fringe users, it stands to reason that is what Netflix will do. Doby Gillis whaa fucking whaa. Sergio Carmona The only obvious thing here is your sarcasm detector not working properly. Go have it fixed please. Jimk4003 Nah, I'm good. h4rr4r So the reason are to make the product worse for the consumer. Great idea, now piracy looks better and better. Jimk4003 What percentage of phones are rooted though? Most people won't care, or even notice the change. h4rr4r It does not matter, if it drives even one person to piracy that is a loss. Jimk4003 But if they can ensure better licensing deals via these new terms, which will attract more customers at the expense of a few rooted users who make up a tiny fraction of overall users; will Netflix care about that loss? h4rr4r But if it encourages piracy the other side of the contract should want to avoid it. Gaining customers in the short term like this hurts the whole market in the long term. Cyber_Akuma Because yeah, people are going to rip movies from Netflix and not off a Blu-Ray.... and even IF they were to attempt to rip them off Netflix, they would use a PHONE and not a PC.... Jimk4003 Ripping Blu-rays isn't Netflix's problem, and Netflix don't need to try and guess what device someone would try and commit piracy with, when the technology exists to restrict them all. Cyber_Akuma You are missing the point, people aren't going to be ripping from Netflix over ripping from a Blu-Ray, and on top of that, they sure as hell aren't going to be ripping off a phone. And actually, you are wrong, the technology to "resist them all" does NOT actually exist. There is no one technology that "restricts them all" but several different technologies for different platforms with various levels of viability and success. Jimk4003 I said 'the technology exists'. When did I say it was a single piece of technology? Let's not be those guys who get in a pedantic argument about semantics on the internet. Regarding the issue under discussion; Netflix's job is to make their platform as robust as possible against piracy, using whatever technology is available to them. Blu-Ray simply isn't their problem. Cyber_Akuma Because just arguing "technology exists" is worthless, plenty of technology exists, and plenty of it is misused. Technically the technology to remotely brick your phone exists too, doesn't mean it's fine to use just because it "exists". And no, their platform already is robust, you are trying to ignore the fact that people ripping movies off a phone is a complete and total non-issue just to try to argue for Netflix's sake, this is ESPECIALLY considering the fact that it harms far more legitimate people than it helps. Sorry, but no, just a plain and completely undesputable NO. You can't argue that it's ok to use something that will hurt a large majority of people just to potentially possibly stop an extreme minority of people who would not even use this method anyway. That's like arguing it's ok to burn down a house to kill a spider. Jimk4003 "You can't argue that it's ok to use something that will hurt a large majority of people". We're talking about Netflix blocking rooted users; in what reality do they constitute the 'large majority' of Android users? Cyber_Akuma I meant the majority of the rooted users. Last time I checked, over 25% of people with an Android device had root access, which is several million users. And OF those several million rooted users, how many do you think actually use their rooted phone and Netflix app to pirate content? Less than 1% Hell, less than 0.1%? They are hurting over 99% of rooted Android users, which while not the majority of Android users is still a lot, to attempt to stop (and not even that effectively as there have been work-around for SafetyNet checks for nearly a year now) an extreme minority OF a minority from doing something they are unlikely to do due to other methods anyway. Richard Markert >I meant the majority of the rooted users. Even the majority of rooted users is a drop in the ocean when it comes to Android users worldwide. Cyber_Akuma Again, over 25%. You also completely missed the point of the argument in that this hurts nearly all rooted users that would not use this maliciously. Lord Argyris Looks like I'll have to start updating manually then. Or just not bother with the app at all since I rarely use Netflix on my phone as it is. SpasilliumNexus Thank goodness the 3T's Open Beta of OxygenOS is good enough for me to not unlock my device and stick with complete stock. Now I wonder why I haven't received any Netflix app updates beyond 4.16.1 build 15145 on the Play Store, when APKMirror has 4 newer versions. ast00 They asked for it. Now pirate their content knowing that you tried doing it the legal way, but THEY declined. Φώτης Because unlocking your Android powered device is such a "bad" thing to do. Whatever Netflix. Ailín Ó’S Ναι, ακριβώς... 😑 C64 How about some English Rob Google translate says that "Ναι, ακριβώς" translates to "Yes, exactly". pcriz How about some Google translate :-/ C64 This is an English website, so you have to talk English. I'm Dutch, so i talk (or try to talk) English too. It hasn't to be perfect, but it would be bs if I talked Dutch over here.

EowynCarter Yeah me too. And unless they change this, bye netflix account. No point in something I can't use anymore. Demoncat The funny part about video DRM is it's easily defeated. It's more convenient to steal the videos than to deal with the DRM restrictions. Fedup Exactly. Between VPN'ed torrents and nzbs, my Sonarr downloads all TV shows (netflix, HBO, ABC/CBS/NBC/FOX) automatically within minutes of them being ripped and posted by others. It is 100% automated, and with my Plex server running, I can watch shows anywhere - cost = $0.00. I don't do this to save money. I do it for the convenience, lack of ads, and freedom of time/place shifting. Heck, some shows actually download BEFORE they air on network TV (i.e. Designated Survivor). stan dex 97 new dark web premium links . also included are netfix lifetime membership links as well as graphic Live chat links (use anonymously) https://satoshibox.com/axbr7vnm6ifzk8hwtcreoe28/buy d0x360 I cancelled​ my account, sent them feedback and then just asked a friend who I let use HBO go and a Chromecast ultra if I could use their Netflix. David Gabel That seems rather dumb. Why cancel your service to them yet still use it via someone else? You're not teaching them anything. For an example, let's say you have a MacBook, and Apple does something to piss you off. You sell your MacBook, but then borrow a friend's MacBook. Nothing was actually accomplished. d0x360 Nothing was accomplished? I cancelled my account and let them know why. Now they aren't making money off me but I still to use their service. Your analogy is deeply flawed...deeply. So deeply I don't think you understand exactly what an analogy is. David Gabel So, you're "not giving them money" yet you still support them by using their product. It still seems like your logic is flawed. If you're really that pissed at Netflix, don't use it. Period. Use a different service instead of supporting them by borrowing it off a friend, as they are also giving them money (and support) , too via their subscription. revbones How is using their service for free "supporting" them? They aren't getting any revenue off you if you're not paying them. Saying you're supporting them by not paying them is a little stupid don't you think? xyz lol. So by your "logic" a person who pirates House of Cards is also supporting Netflix ? BobButtons You're doing the opposite of supporting. You're getting the benefits of their service while stopping payment and adding to server load which they pay for. David Gabel So far, your stance is the only one that makes sense. The rest so far are noise Sir Doogie Houser M.D.Esq. 200 You seen like an incredulous douch who I'd suplex onto a park bench for being a lap dog bitch.How is canceling or stealing not doing something.Also,its not a fucking macbook jerkoff its a paid service for TV on a phone they expect to be paid for.BTFO nagi Just another step that makes pirating the same content more convenient... we should really be going the other way if they ever want piracy to be reduced. lomsha Funny thing is their content is available to stream all over the internet. Don't see how this move fights piracy as long as computers have access. This just alienates legit users who are doing nothing nefarious on unlocked/rooted devices. Richard Branches By one everybody pays... Pathum Addarapathirana Dude I root my phone to just get iPhone emojis and to tether without my carrier knowing. Like I'm not stealing anything this will just make me stop paying for Netflix. Latheryin Just a heads up. Those treating hiding mods are fake. There is no way to hide if from the carrier. Heck if they wanted to they could see every web page you load from a ton of different places and ways. Yan Minari That’s why god invented VPN Latheryin Yes but even then it doesn't block everything. qqqqqq My provider absolutely blocks tethering - I've been using various methods, including VPNs, to block it for literally YEARS... Hasn't been difficult. Dylan Harris That's not true. All you have to due to bypass tethering limits on t-mobile is to change the TTL on the tethered device. Latheryin That just gets by the automated checks. Get a live person to randomly pick your account (not really likely but happens) and it is not had to tell if someone is tethering. Dmitri Smirnov All that person will be able to tell is whether customer is using a lot of data or not. And this is the root of the problem: be honest that you are limited traffic, instead of trying to play this game of "we'll pretent we are giving you unlimited data and in return you'll only use small-format mobile device, so that we'll hope that you won't be able to use as much of it". Kind of "all you can eat, but you have to only use a tea cup and one chopstick". Latheryin No the issue is people being entitled and taking advantage of things. You have people running their gaming systems and using hundreds of gb a month. Not only is that kinda dumb but it violate the fair use act in most cell TOS. If people didn't abuse the system then it wouldn't be an issue. Also just some food for thought. If they can't tell anything more then a lot of data just how do they route the traffic properly? Make no mistake. If the carrier wanted to they could tell. I know for a fact that there is a team for both att and Verizon that is tasked with just that. Dmitri Smirnov >No the issue is people being entitled and taking advantage of things. You have people running their gaming systems and using hundreds of gb a month. "taking advantage" I thought that people were in their right by using what they paid for. Allright, tell me this - is it allright for me to watch 4K video on my phone (since the screens allow it now)? What's the difference between this and me watching the same stream on my laptop over my phone's connection? What if I just redirect the video stream to my TV using WiDi or any other technology? How is browsing a site from a laptop different from browsing it from a phone network-congestion-wise? And then it boils down to the same argument - carriers are just hoping you'll use the network less from you phone device, as it's less convenient. The more convenient smartphones become for consuming large volumes of traffic, the sooner carriers will have to more away from this scan and expose the actual numbers. > If people didn't abuse the system then it wouldn't be an issue. If carriers would be honest and upfront about "hidden" caps, then people would not be able to game the system. > Also just some food for thought. If they can't tell anything more then a lot of data just how do they route the traffic properly? Make no mistake. If the carrier wanted to they could tell. Latheryin Tethering was never even an extra charge until people started taking advantage of the mobile networks. Watching 4k videos is not a big deal, using 200gb of mobile data in a cycle is flat out stupid. Mobile networks were not designed for that type of traffic from a single device. Nor was it made to handle running your ps4 while you are gaming. Why do you think that pages are made to be mobile friendly? Not only is it a usability issue but a data usage issue as well. It's not hidden. All people have to do is read the TOS. It's all right there. Yet most people just don't want to take the time to do it and then get made about it. Can't blame the carriers for that. Dmitri Smirnov > Watching 4k videos is not a big deal, using 200gb of mobile data in a cycle is flat out stupid. a) I'm glad we're finally on the same page that the real problem for networks is data usage and not tethering or no tethering. b) You are aware that you're contradicting yourself in the same sensense? 4K 60Fps video bitrate is ~20-40 MiB/s which gives an average movie the size of about 72GiB. so by your definition watching a movie in good quality is OK as long as you don't watch more than 3 of them in a month. c) how is using mobile data that you paid for - stupid? If there are caps - announce them and make it impossible to go over them instead of shaming people who actually decide to take you up on your offer. d) tethering has not been an extra charge until telcos understood that they could charge extra for it (just like them toying with idea of charging extra for Instant Messenger traffic, because it undercuts their SMS plans). > It's not hidden. All people have to do is read the TOS. It's all right there. Yet most people just don't want to take the time to do it and then get made about it. Can't blame the carriers for that. Well, carriers are the ones calling their plans "unlimited" and hiding the actual caps either buried deep in the ToS or behind the vague "reasonable usage". So don't blame people for not wanting to wade through pages of legalspeak just to learn that you lied and "unlmited" is just "50Gb and then throttled". Fedup Agreed. The problem is the AMOUNT of data consumed by a given user account - no how it is consumed. If carriers are concerned about individuals abusing their network, then they need to flag those accounts that use an excessive amount of bandwidth - whether it's through tethering or directly on the device itself. I could easily burn through 150GB/mo on my TMO Note 4 w/o tethering simply by leaving my Blue Iris app connected and streaming 24/7. So it's actually very easy to abuse the system without ever turning on the tethering. Android Developer Is the tether solution needed even if you do it using USB ? Fulbring What a stupid move. I pay for the premium for Netflix and I never thought that I might have to cancel my service just because they did this. The only reason why I have root is because of AdAway and TitaniumBackup. I still use the stock OnePlus 3T ROM. Wasn't expecting this at all.... Kinda suck. Will be interesting to see how many customers they lose. Julian Berger Not enough to change it back... 4Ui812 DRM has no place in our lives. I suspect Netflix will have a change of heart within 6 months. Branko Xiaomi phones say bye bye to Netflix. Google go fuck yourselves. Steve_Jobroni Go fucking buy a windows phone. 天地人 Seriously though Windows phones are great. The only problem with them is the lack of applications. Otherwise, it runs great on low-end hardware, has a great UI, the homescreen is innovative, synchronisation with Windows PCs is cool, etc. dukaki Don't forget that you can use the Netflix website on Edge instead of their shitty app, and it streams at full 1080p, even on my L650 with a 720p screen. 天地人 Wait the Netflix application hasn't an option to stream at FHD? dukaki Nope, just 480p like on android. The device has to be "certified" and there are no certified windows phones afaik. The WP app doesn't even have downloads yet, I think. Edit: Just checked, no option to download here but you can on the desktop app. EowynCarter Might end with a visit at the apple store in my case. Windows phone is kind of not supported anymore. Jimk4003 This is Netflix, not Google. Cyber_Akuma Google invented this SafetyNet crap, let anyone use it for any reason (Hell, Pokemon GO of all things started using it), and over the last year have been making it even more and more strict and unforgiving. So no, a HUGE part of the blame does lie on Google for being openly hostile towards rooted users and not giving a damn about them. Jimk4003 There are legitimate reasons to use Safetynet to check the integrity of a device: Android Pay (or banking apps in general) is one example. It isn't necessarily hostility to root users; it's just a reality that Google need to be able to demonstrate to banks or other third parties that their OS is secure, and that people can't bypass built in security safeguards. Netflix need to do the same with the studios they redistribute content for; and they've chosen to use Safetynet to do it. Netflix isn't a human right; you have no inalienable right to root your phone and to use Netflix. Cyber_Akuma Except that not even my own banking app uses SafetyNet, it still has root checking and certain sensitive features are disabled if I am rooted, but not the entire app. Furthermore, it IS hostility to rooted users, because anyone can toss SafetyNet into their app for any reason whatsoever (such as games using it "just because" in case of cheaters... which doesn't even help at all to stop them). Google has been completely unwilling to work out ANY sort of compromise or method that can keep a phone secure without basically tossing rooted users under the bus. Jimk4003 What sort of compromise do you envision? Cyber_Akuma I am saying that they didn't even try. PCs by default obviously allow admin accounts all the time, even as the main user account (as much as that is not recommended) yet can maintain security. Google when they were confronted with people who were hurt by SafetyNet, legitimate users mind you, basically just shrugged them off and didn't even bother considering what could be done to allow the device to remain secure while also having such safeties in place. I mean, all these apps that you can use on your phone, can also be used on a PC, many of them available in either a browser or native app format, yet it remains secure. There is no reason this could not be done with Android, especially considering it used Linux as a base, they are just refusing to even consider it. Jimk4003 Don't you already have that choice? Your phone is sold without root access (i.e. no admin rights), and you can then choose whether or not to root your device and gain elevated privileges. If you do choose to root your device, you will lose access to some Safetynet enabled applications. You can, of course, unroot if necessary. Cyber_Akuma First of all, not all phones are. Especially in non-US countries. Second, it shouldn't have to be a choice. How many PC apps refuse to run under an admin account? Practically none. I shouldn't have to choose between having root access or being able to use a apps that more and more are starting to add this nonsense to them. Third, it's not even just root, even having an unlocked BOOTLOADER now, even if your rom is 100% stock and unrooted, can trip SafetyNet, it didn't used to be that strict. It's ridiculous to claim one should be able to have one or the other, even SafetyNet could have been designed to not be this brokenly strict, but Google had no interest in doing so, and they are rapidly making having root more and more useless while we still have to deal with all the junk they force on your phone from the manufacturer... that you can only remove with root. Jimk4003 Well, it is what it is. You believe you shouldn't have to make a choice, whereas I believe life is all about making choices and living with the outcomes. We seldom get everything we want, and neither Netflix, nor rooting, are inalienable rights. Whether or not you think it should be a choice, it is one; choose what you feel is best for you. Cyber_Akuma That's not even an argument, that's just trying to claim that the status quo should remain for no reason other than it is the status quo. It shouldn't have to be a choice, and arguing that people have to choose between root and having an increasingly less amount of apps just because "it is what it is" is insanity. In fact, it wasn't even the status quo before until Google started pulling this nonsense with SafetyNet a short while ago. That doesn't mean people should just accept it. Jimk4003 It's not an argument, because there is no argument to be had. The reality of the situation is self-evident; you can't have a rooted device and install Netflix via Google Play. Accepting the status quo has nothing to do with it; it's simply acknowledging reality. You have to choose what's more important to you; Netflix or rooting your phone. Finding the reality frustrating, as you clearly do, won't make it any less real. If this was a serious discussion on human rights; censorship, migration, justice, gender equality etc., then it's important in a democracy to be aware of your rights and responsibilities, and challenge the status quo where necessary. But this isn't anything like that. This is two for-profit corporations, Google and Netflix, who provide services to which you have no fundamental right to access, nor any obligation to use. You can choose to pay for their services and accept their terms and conditions, or you can choose not to. You don't get to pick the terms and conditions of the service someone else is providing you; however you are free to not use the service if you don't like the terms and conditions under which they are provided. That's it; it's no simpler or more complicated than that. Ranting on the internet about how unfair you perceive it to be is irrelevant. Again, it is what it is. Cyber_Akuma Again, there is no "it is what it is" argument. There should be no choice, PERIOD. You are basically saying that people should not complain about this just because "it is what it is". No, it is NOT what it is, it should NOT BE what it is, and people can and WILL complain that it SHOULD NOT be what it is. You aren't even making any rational arguments anymore, just re-stating what the current situation is and then basically claiming that people should not want or expect better. Jimk4003 You can want or expect better if you like. Netflix, like every other for-profit enterprise in a capitalist system, will either succeed or fail based on its ability to turn a profit. Right now, Netflix is turning a profit, and clearly thinks it can be more profitable by excluding rooted users whose theoretical ability to circumvent DRM restrictions may impact its ability to secure rights to new content. Clearly you disagree with their stance, and the only way to see for sure if your disagreement is warranted is to watch their financial performance from here on out. None of the above changes the fact that you aren't entitled to Netflix. You've chosen to root your phone, and Netflix have recently chosen to exclude rooted users. That leaves you with a choice to make. Even if you think that choice is unfair, even if you think you should be able to have both. The reality is you can't have both, and you will have to choose. Again, Netflix isn't a right. Go elsewhere if you disagree with their business practices; that's how capitalism works. Beyond that, you're just having a spat with reality; and that's a tough fight to win ;) Cyber_Akuma Actually, what do you think would lose them more profits, the theoretical minority OF a minority that MIGHT rip movies on their phones (which still requires a Netflix account in the first place) or blocking that 25% minority? Also, drop this "right" nonsense. No, seriously, drop it right now. People are paying for a Netflix account, they DO have a right to get the service they paid for. Netflix made zero warning or mention of this impending block, they pulled it out of nowhere for paying customers. So sorry, but they DO have a right to the service, since they are paying for it. Sony was found to be legally in the wrong when they removed the OtherOS feature from the PS3, because why? Because people PAID for the console when it had that feature, they DID have a right to what they paid for. You're just having a spat with arguing for argument's sake when you don't even have an argument. Jimk4003 There is no argument; it's the reality of the situation. Netflix have implemented DRM controls that block access to the Netflix app via the Play Store on rooted devices. I do understand why Netflix want to tighten their DRM procedures, and I do understand why some people have been left frustrated by this change. The reality is, however, if you want to download the Netflix app via Google Play, you will need an un-rooted phone; such as the phones used by the majority of Android users. That's all that's happening. I get that you don't like it. But stamping your foot and shouting 'no fair, no fair' achieves nothing. Netflix are entitled to run their business how they see fit within the law; and consumers get to choose whether they want to give Netflix their business or not. That's all there is to it. Don't like the way Netflix do business; don't give Netflix your money. Cyber_Akuma All you are doing with the "it is what it is" argument is just repeating what the article is saying. That is not conductive to anything. Anyone who has read the article knows what is happening right now. And sorry, but you are doing the same stamping your foot with the "well, it is what it is" argument. Not to mention that you are also wrong, because over the last 5 or so years ALONE there have been dozens of examples of consumers speaking out against policies or DRM and the companies begin forced to reverse it from the backlash. So you are doing nothing but hurting legitimate users by trying to argue "it is what it is". And again, no, they are not entitled to run their business in a way that without warning locks customers out of what they paid for, Sony tried this... and got in legal trouble and lost. So sorry, but you are wrong, and you have been nothing but wrong this entire argument. Netflix isn't' "entitled" to do this, people DO have a reason to complain, there IS a reason to complain, complaining HAS changed such practices before, and all you are doing is further hurting legitimate users by attempting to insist the "it is what it is" non-argument. Your entire argument has been fundamentally wrong from the start. Jimk4003 It's not my argument; it's simply Netflix's position. I get you don't agree with it, but it's totally valid for Netflix to wish to strengthen their DRM procedures. You do know I'm not responsible for Netflix's decision making, right? It is what it is; I wouldn't get too upset about it. Cyber_Akuma Again, "it is what it is" is not a valid argument. Jimk4003 No it's not an argument. Again, there is no argument necessary; the reality of the situation is self-evident, and no amount of arguing here will change it. The fact is this; YOU rooted your phone. You weren't forced. You should have known that by rooting your phone you are modifying the device beyond its factory specification. You should have known that this essentially makes you responsible for the proper operation of the device; you no longer have the device manufacturer or Google to turn to when software that you have modified doesn't work as expected. You should also have known that rooting prevents a device from complying with the compatibility test suite, and that this can affect your devices ability to function correctly. You should have been aware of the SafetyNet API, and anticipated the fact that this API would be adopted more and more broadly as Google promoted its usage. You can't blame Google for this; as before, once you modify your device beyond its factory spec, you're responsible for supporting yourself. Rooting a device is at the owners risk. You've now found yourself in a situation where a modification you have made to your device prevents you from accessing a service you want to use. That's on you; no-one made you modify your device, no-one said they would take responsibility for the changes you have made to your device, and rooted users are expected to assume liability for any ramifications and complications they face as a result of their decision to modifying their device. Netflix are well within their rights to enforce DRM on their product by using the SafetyNet API provided by Google, and the Google documentation clearly states rooted devices will fail the CTS check. This documentation is publicly available. You went ahead and rooted your device anyway. That's on you. It's no-one elses job to make sense of the decisions you have taken. You're free to carry on using Netflix if you return your device to a state where the integrity of the device can be verified. Or you're free to carry on using a rooted device and living with the compromises that entails. Your choice. Cyber_Akuma I don't think you get it. All you are doing is parroting what the article is saying. Furthermore, despite there being plenty of examples of complaining doing EXACTLY what you claim it cannot do, that is to change such decisions, you keep repeating that "complaining will do nothing". You are a broken record, arguing the same "it is what it is" argument over and over so you can avoid actually thinking. An argument (and yes, no matter how much YOU stomp your feet that it is not, it IS an argument) that has already been disproven over and over and over. You also ignored that there are many countries where phones are already sold rooted, or how such things don't effect using such services on a PC with admin rights which are the same thing, or the dozens of other holes in your logic large enough to sail a ship through. There is no "you should have been aware" because this is a total lapse in common sense and my device is in no way incompatible from a hardware or software level, but rather, the app is purposely rejecting it. Furthermore, they made no prior warning whatsoever. This is like arguing "you should have known modern cars could be remotely disabled" if a dealership decides to just disable all cars with an aftermarket radio installed. I don't know where to even begin with all the broken wrong logic in that last post. Why are you even here if you couldn't care less? You are free to carry on being a living example of "First they came", but don't come crying about how nobody else is listening to you because you could not possibly be any more wrong. I DO have a right to use Netflix on my device, rooted or no, if I am paying for it. If you argue against this, you are wrong. People DO have a right to root their devices, if you argue against this, you are wrong. People DO have a right (and have many many MANY times in the past) to challenge the "it is what it is" status quo, if you argue against this, you are wrong. And I know you WILL argue against this, which will mean that, see above, you are wrong. I have been more than patient with your insane thick-headnedness. At this point I can't tell if you are being willfully ignorant or really are just that ignorant. Or just trolling, that is an option as well. There is no way anyone rational at this point can continue to argue the insanity that you have argued. Jimk4003 I interpret personal insults as an indicator that the individual making them no longer has any faith in their actual arguments, and so I think it's time to call time on this particular discussion. As you've pointed out, neither of us is getting anywhere. It's been fun, but once it starts getting abusive, the fun has to stop. It's a shame, because DRM Vs individual user rights has the potential to be a really interesting discussion topic. I hope you get what you're after; and that the reality of the situation will change to be more in line with what you think it should be. Unfortunately I imagine the situation regarding DRM and rooted devices will only get more restrictive going forward. Take care. Cyber_Akuma You purposely instigate people into losing their patience with you, and then claim "I win because you got angry", especially when the anger is because you were refusing to understand the entire argument throughout this entire mess. Richard Markert Root is, by definition, unsecure. Any time you have userland processes that have access to ring0 you are inherently unsecure, as there are no restrictions placed upon running code at that point. Cyber_Akuma And yet, there are ways to run it securely on PCs. Netflix and online banking would not be available on PCs if it wasn't. TedPhillips mostly agree. by providing a turn-key 'lockdown' check, and further by ret-conning it into playstore access (let's see how far they take that) -google is now openly hostile to anyone who bought into android for it's ability to customize and truly 'own' your own device. the open source roots of android was a big differentiator vs something like iOS, but now that they have dominate market position - they are walking away from that without concern. (only worrying about how slow they need to boil the frog to get away with it) meanwhile, what middle manager is going to say 'no' to adding safetyNet checks in their app or play store listing? it is an easy way for them to write down on potential risks, unjustified (which it pretty much always is) or not. blindexecutioner So the solution is to install from outside the play store. That's great for security. Way to go. Richard Markert No they don't. Since Windows 7, new and default users are not Admin accounts. koiulpoi Sorry, this is absolutely wrong. The first user created on a Windows PC has full administrative access, limited by UAC. You can still delete System32, it's just mildly harder than it used to be. If "new and default users" were not Admin accounts, they couldn't install software, so... Richard Markert Default user accounts are higher than Limited accounts, but not as high as Admin accounts. That's why they can install software. Linux users are not admins but can still install software, right? It started on Windows 7, expanded in 8/8.1 and now in Windows 10 a user account behaves just like a user account in Linux. It has no access to %systemdir% unless you manually go in the folder properties and give your user account Admin permissions to it. You can still run things AS admin by giving the permission at runtime, but since all that requires is pressing a button (if your built-in admin account isn't passworded, which it isn't by default, one step forward two back, sigh) and most users are too "stupid" to simply not press that button. koiulpoi It's really funny when people speak authoritatively about something they're so wrong about. The first account created by the Windows OOBE is automatically added to the Administrators group. This means they're an Administrator. They have Administrative privileges. The fact that certain actions are blocked until you click "yes" on a simple UAC prompt doesn't stop this; they're in "Admin Approval Mode", which can be disabled via GPO if you care to. If you buy a computer from Dell (example), set it up, then go to System32 and start deleting .dll files, it'll ask for administrative privileges, but you can click yes and away it goes! Some files are protected at "SYSTEM" level, which is higher than administrator, but DEFAULT USERS ARE ADMINISTRATORS. This has ABSOLUTELY nothing to do with the "password" on the built-in "Administrator" account. That account is disabled out-of-the-box. Please, you're digging a bigger hole trying to look "right". How to prove this: Set up a new computer. Set up user default for MS. Start -> Run -> netplwiz -> Be amazed that your user is part of the group "Administrators". TechGuy22 Haha kodi Doesn't matter to me I Stopped paying for Netflix long time ago. C64 Haha Teranium TV 😎 TechGuy22 I like that too. You can even get the mod one and remove the ads. Lol C64 I know, i always use those. I want to pay for the dev, but there's no option to do that. Koko time is coming with a big update to tim242 Thief. Renato Santos This is stupid. Congratulations, Netflix. Jan-Lk Else It is also getting more and more necessary to unlock / root devices due to missing updates etc. But I'm not a Netflix customer and won't become one. C64 Whahaha, this has to be the most retarded move of the year in any category (even Trump can't top this). I'm glad i don't use Old Crap Flix. A Person Hillary, then Netflix. C64 Nope sorry. Since Trump is your president i can't take America serious anymore A Person Timeout, you're not even a US citizen? No interest in your opinion. James F Wow. Just wow. I can't take you seriously either if that's how you treat people. Not cool, man. A Person "Wow, just wow"? When he can vote in our elections I'll take his opinions of our elections seriously. It is highly ill-informed anyhow. Paul Sterling A person wins! Marcelove Timeout, you are a Trump supporter? No interest in your opinion (neither anyone smart in the world). Roy Riddex Just so I'm clear on this, by unlocked are we talking about SIM unlocked? lomsha No no, unlocked bootloader. Roy Riddex Thanks Corbin Davenport Unlocked bootloader. pbergonzi I wonder how long they'll stick with that premise seeing as how much public opinion expressed here is against them. Screw them. Get the APK somewhere else or install magisk and hide your root. Too many people root their devices and have a good reason for doing so and Netflix should not penalize them. Doby Gillis Dude, normal people don't give a fuck about rooted phones. It's just the elitist twats who do it anymore. twiz0r Dude, you're an elitist twat. Richard Markert Most people who root seem to be. The sentiment among rooters is "if you don't root your phone, you're not as good as me and don't deserve to have a phone. Root you stupid noob!" twiz0r thanks for confirming your twatness. good day. C64 One word ..... Bullshit Corey Kinard I've yet to see that... Maybe you just feel like that because they do in fact know more than you? Richard Markert My first version of Android was 1.5. I've seen it for many years. How long have you been in the scene? EowynCarter My phone isn't rooted. And not compatible anymore ! Franco Fassio Unlocked bootloader maybe? EowynCarter Yes. But seam I can't lock it without wipe. So screw you Netflix. Marcelove Let me guess, your profile pic is that right? https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/0f0c4f3e3ce40074aebfe58d80511d4a0b7d4a94896ce54d82e448a1cd2e3ceb.jpg bruce lancaster Dude. It isn't just rooted phones - Also unlocked. Elitists get their iphones and galaxy s8s from att and verizon. Normal people get their devices from amazon, ebay, newegg, gearbest etc. Jimk4003 I'm sure Netflix are terrified that the tiny fraction of Android users who come to this site, and the similarly tiny fraction who root their phones, are bothered. The rest of the world won't care. bruce lancaster An article in Wireless Week (cellphone industry rag) a couple of months back says it's now a majority of phones in Asia that are unlocked and Europe is getting pretty close to 50/50. US passed 30% unlocked around Christmas. People aren't getting their phones from ATT, Verizon, etc any more now that they have to pay full retail and don't get a free or heavily discounted flagship device with contract renewal. They are getting them from Amazon, Gearbest, Newegg, etc and moving their sim. If I owned stock in Netflix right now, I'd sell it quick on this news. Everything that isn't already mobile is going mobile. Alienating half the European market and 30% of the US market is asinine. Fedup Yup. Ditched my flagship Samsung phone for a 'budget' Moto G5 Plus that is 100% compatible with all four US carriers (and their dozens of MNVOs). Swapping providers is as easy as changing the sim. And despite the slower spec'ed hardware, the carrier bloat-free Nougat is WAY faster than my TW Galaxy phone - and the battery life is INSANE. C64 Probably 90 % of the people don't know what root is. Almost every person I know owns an Android device, but i'm the only geek who flashes and roots his devices bruce lancaster It isn't just rooted phones but also unlocked phones. Got your phone on amazon? Got it on ebay? Got it from gearbest? Got it from newegg? Yup. No netflix for you without jumping through enough hoops that you'll actually know about rooting by the time you get it done. Fedup Are we conflating a carrier-unlocked vs. bootloader unlocked phone? They are two distinctly different things, and I doubt that having a carrier-unlocked phone (i.e. using a TMO phone on ATT, or VZ on Sprint) has any impact on SafetyNet or Widevine. pbergonzi Judging from the posts here it looks like nobody who roots their phone uses Netflix anyway so I guess it's moot. But the outcry sure did get them a bunch of free publicity. T4rd This is what Magisk is for. Pretty sure if I can still use Android Pay with my rooted 6P, I can still use/update Netflix through the Play Store. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Magisk still requires that you unlock your bootloader, which is enough to trigger safety net these days, so that won't work. TechGuy22 You don't know how magisk works do you Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ I understand that Magisk is a great tool for modifying my system without actually modifying it. I understand that there are many modules that allow you to do things like hide root, bypass security modules, skin your system, and plenty of other things. What I don't understand is how you can install magisk without unlocking your bootloader. Back when I originally tried it out with pokemon go, it worked well for a while, but eventually even just having my bootloader unlocked was all it took to throw SafetyNet. If that's not an issue anymore, then great! But maybe say that instead of being snarky. Thomas Gladdines Bootloader can be simply locked after rooting and installing a custom recovery. Edwin O. Lol no You could, but then you can't flash anything with said recovery... So no point Thomas Gladdines LOL the recovery doesn't stop working after a bootloader is locked, only fastboot won't flash images but the recovery can do whatever it wants to, update the rom, edit system files etc. Muzzy996 Well as an example for the Google Pixel: https://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=71901761&postcount=454 In this case all it takes is a kernel that supports Magisk and hides the fact that the bootloader is unlocked, at which point with Magisk Hide enabled all root and SafetyNet checks pass. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Excellent. I'll have to look back into this then, last time I used magisk it wasn't as capable, glad to see it's come this far. sbeaulieu Magical Hide is there for that Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Can Magical Hide hide that my bootloader is unlocked? Serious question, not being sarcastic or snarky as I was below. sbeaulieu It does make the SafetyNet check pass iJeggu Magisk itself doesn't hide an unlocked bootloader it only hides root but must custom roms simply delete the verifiedbootstate -flag which in turn makes safetynet pass even with an unlocked bootloader. Some older devices don't have this flag in their kernels in the first place so safetynet will accept that the flag is missing. Link to the patch that most custom roms (kernels to be specific) have to pass safetynet: https://github.com/sultanxda/android_kernel_oneplus_msm8996/commit/abc05b16bbd33521c2fffaf491c5657a94bfcfc5 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/5b1ff3f47e32d5f57ddadcd650a5b94725bd4e6242cea92e269f51e988d0d426.png T4rd Except it's working for me right now... jonzey231 This has been happening for a week now. I tweeted it to Ruddock a few days ago. Just didn't put together that it was because I was unlocked. https://twitter.com/jonzey231/status/862122438125072384 steelew Google really needs to start stealing from the root community the way apple takes from the jailbreak community. It feels like rooting is way down except for a few (legal) use cases. If it weren't for visual tweaks & usability tweaks, I would have no need to root (personally). This kind of stuff starts to make rooting unpleasant. I already can't use fingerprint auth in my banking app any more because root. Jesús Cuenca They do. I used rooms for like 8 years maybe? And a lot of the "new features" always come of the rom or root comunity. Right now i use roms, but not root. Marcelove I'm trying to stay indoors, but is complicate... Greenify for example, works at no root devices nowadays... But is way better with root and Xposed... Doze can't compare against Greenify... Maybe at version number 20 root wouldn't be necessary... Sandeep Raghuraman What about the version downloaded from Amazon app store though? Does that work fine? TwoBit Gary It worked, but it is old version without show downloads. Go to apkmirror oculairmedia Interesting move. I flashed a custom ROM on my Nexus 6 because stock was so slow that it was getting unusable, but screw me right ? Atoqir In my country lots of stuff doesn't work on unrooted devices. My bank app, payment app and local cable TV and digicorder app all stopped working. Also s-health doesn't work anymore and soon Netflix. Time to unroot Marcelove "Time to unroot" Sheep. Richard Markert Rooting is insecure. You don't need to access the system partition except to break things. Benjamin Walburn If that were the case then this wouldn't be an issue. Nobody is looking to break their phone. Richard Markert Few people I've talked to online know what they're doing when it comes to root. Most of those end up breaking things. Rooting is far too easy and probably shouldn't exist at all. Benjamin Walburn You could say the same about anything, not just modification of phones. Maybe you shouldn't own a car if you can't fix it yourself, or have kids if you aren't a doctor. Rooting isn't easy, it's made easy by the hard work of other people. It's not up to you what other people do with their property, you have no right to say that they shouldn't. And if someone breaks their phone, what does it have to do with you? It's their hobby and their phone. You're not their daddy. senoredusty Or use Magisk DJMix No need. You could use magisk su hide for the moment. it still passes the safetynet. I too use a banking app that cannot be used on normal root proocess faceless128 "please stop giving us money and use Kodi instead" Sounds like a great business plan! JD For the sake of Kodi's developers don't say Kodi in that context. ericshmerick Hrmm, every time I hear Kodi, I think of pirated content. Guess when people are like "I use Kodi for my 30TB media collection" I stop and wonder how... Yes, ripping a lifetime of DVDs, but nah. Probably piracy. C64 I know a few how really use it legally Powsniffer0110 Yea I use it legally 95% of the time. ErectBipedal nah man, I use Kodi to browse my 30TB of linux isos. Totally legit I swear. Chazz Matthews Torrents are legal too. Just depends on the content. Mike Honestly though, if pirate add-ons wern't available on kodi, 98% of the people using it now would not have even heard of it before. Even bad publicity is good publicity. They are not going to publicly come out and say it, but the add-on's are the only reason they're well known. Andy Roid But kodi makes piracy so easy! Blian Oh god, please stop. Nobody is using Kodi for their DVD rips. Railwayman I rather say Fusion and Exodus et al instead since Kodi is... Kodi and you have to install what you want. The Netflix business plan is for her more people on Exodus, Phoenix and SALTS - not to mention Terrarium TV and MovieBox as well. Kevin Strident Kodi is open source. If Kodi stops wanting to be as useful as it is now, someone will fork it and keep it doing what its users enjoy. cbstryker Kodi is just an open source media player. To watch any pirated content you either need to download it or install an unaffiliated plugin that streams from pirated sources. C64 Next kodi wil have drm build in. So people have to use forks. I stopped using kodi since i found Teranium TV. cbstryker That makes zero sense. Kodi's reason for existing would stop. C64 That's BS my friend, Kodi (xbmc) has started on the original xbox and was made and used as a media player Justin D Same...but with Plex and something else >.> Dany Lol I know right? I was using Kodi more than Netflix anyway so... Dmitry Stepanushkin Xposed + RootCloak or something similar will do it for most of apps for those who need root. So I think not a big problem. Abhishek Saral Not a big problem but a big annoyance. tehboogieman Hmm, rootcloak isn't working for me with netflix m477 No, it won't work. Safetynet always fails if you have closed activated, or if you just have an unlocked bootloader. Sometimes even by just having adb debugging turned on. Kan☆n MagiskSU and its manager app comes with a very good hider built-in. No Xposed needed. h4rr4r Beyond pointless. Netflix won by being easier than piracy, this threatens to turn back the clock on that. Lexster These companies don't seem to get that most people pirate because it's easier/cheaper than buying what they want. Yes, it's wrong, whatever, the point is streaming services made it easier for people, which outweighed the hassle of pirating it. You're right, this kind of thing is what will get people to start doing it again more. BobButtons If I can't use Netflix on my rooted phone, it's Netflix that'll go, not the root. They're encouraging piracy. YaKillaCJ Exactly. Screw it, I only have Netflix for convenience. This will also have negative impact on many devices and average consumers even if they never unlock or root. A lot don't have Google certification, such as upcoming OEMs. Then theirs beta roms like Xiaomi and OnePlus that run awesome. Marcelove Funny thing: I was about to become a subscriber of Netflix after seeing House of Cards by PirateBay but now through the official channel because I thought that Netflix deserved my money... Look : deservED... But this movie will keep me at PirateBay... Funny thing 2: I have a Moto G5 that I could unlock and root and I didn't it just because I wanna see how things are nowadays without root... And I use a lot of apps that would work better with root (Greenify for example)... So I would be able to use Netflix... And I won't and will stay that way only because this douchebag move... Congratulations Netflix... Funny thing 3: So happy that I waited till House of Cards release to become a subscriber... Netflix should learn something from Frank Underwood... And from Blockbuster... tim242 Yeah, sure you were. Once a thief, always a thief. koiulpoi This is the most untrue statement I've read on this website. Thomas Elephants can fly 天地人 http://gadling.com/2012/06/10/airline-transports-herd-of-african-elephants-photos/ koiulpoi Nice! You matched it. 天地人 Yes, because illegally pirating from huge corperations which constantly attempt to and successfully brainwash people into agenda using various tricks, is somehow bad? You're not supporting the creators of the show, sure. But you're also not supporting the 6 Jewish companies that control 90% of American media. Anyways, with your little money you wouldn't be benefitting anybody. Do you honestly think those Jewish companies are dying to get a hold of your $120 you payed for Netflix this year? Probably not. The creators of the show, are well off anyways. Don't companies pay them to have their content on their platform and pay for their production cost and wages? Then; they've already been payed. I'm not endorsing piracy. It isn't the best thing to do, but I think calling people a "thief" and grouping them with people who have actually stolen things off individuals which mean a lot to the individual and murdered some individuals in the process, is just stupid. It's not the same as 'stealing' bits of 1s and 0s. Again, I'm not endorsing piracy, however there are a lot of good reasons to pirate movies and TV shows. Paul Sterling You're a thief. People leave their families for months to give you works of art. Games, movies, music. You can't throw them a few bucks? I'm legit, always will be. Also, tax helps everyone. Your wall of text is just trying to convince yourself, thief. 天地人 Nope. A thief is different from a pirate, besides, they've already been payed. And I was talking about TV shows and movies, but you're too dense to realise it. jj14x Not the same. If I spend time writing code for software, and decide to sell a monthly license instead of a perpetual license, that is my choice. Your choice should be to either subscribe to the monthly license, or to find a competitor software to use instead. Choosing to bypass the licensing checks makes you a thief (taking something without the owner's permission makes you a thief). And same logic applies to TV shows/movies. If you want to own the movie and watch it whenever you want it, BUY it. "illegally pirating from huge corperations which constantly attempt to and successfully brainwash people into agenda using various tricks, is somehow bad?"<-- YES - it is still illegal. Just because somebody stole your car doesn't mean you can go and steal that person's car in retaliation. There are laws and procedures on how to handle that. STDog Illegal != bad, legal != good. Thousands of unjust laws have been passed. They made actions illegal that were not bad. Richard Markert It's trickle-down, man. Think about if everybody thought like you. Netflix has 100 million subs and each pay at the minimum $107/yr and that's 10.7 billion. Now if that 10.7 billion were wiped out in an instant, how is Netflix going to make new shows or seasons of existing shows? It's the same with the rest of the content creation business. You and me, we're just a drop in the bucket when it comes to their revenue, but instead of scooping it out a spoonful at a time while adding water by the cup, somebody dumped the bucket over, there would be no money left to pay the content creators before content is even made. Railwayman I guess you like DRM and proprietary vendor lock in? The only moral of the story is: Pay for legit services then and watch posted content - the creators get paid and you get proper content without restrictions. The day the industry realize that DRM, geo blocking and so forth are counter productive will be historic. Fedup Love my Moto G5 Plus. Best phone I've had so far - and that's coming from a number of Samsung flagship phones. It's so much snappier and the battery life is insane. I waited a full 48 hours before caving and unlocking/rooting. Haven't looked back. I hate ads, and w/o root, you can't miracast to anything other than chromecast. Trysta Noticed this a little while ago. The crazy thing is I'm not even rooted or interested in any mods. I needed to sideload the latest version 7.1.2 because my RMA Nexus 6p refused to update on its own. I'm keeping the bootloader unlocked so I can recover if my phone boot loops. I rarely use Netflix on my phone but this is kind of annoying. I suspect this has something to do with offline movie watching (which is amazing). jj14x You don't need to unlock bootloader to sideload the full OTA images that Google publishes on their website. Tim Harman But you do need it to recover in your phone bootloops, as he said. jj14x True, but by that logic, everyone should keep their phone's bootloader unlocked all the time (because a bootloop, in theory, could happen to anyone/anytime) - not just when flashing a factory image. EowynCarter You don't ? Had to when installing a developper preview. Then I left it that way, so I won't be locked out in case of boot loop. TedPhillips or when you have some random block on disk get corrupted, ala nexus 9. ilovetesla Dumbest blocking I've ever heard Bruce Wayne I stopped rooting ages ago. Android has gotten so good that I don't need it anymore. Muzzy996 Good for you! Not everyone feels the same though, I know I sure don't. Tasker, Adaway, Greenify, Titanium, Substratum and GMD Gesture Controls are all more important to me than Netflix. The day Netflix stops working on my rooted devices (which are what I watch it on, not my TV) is the day I'll cancel my service. No big loss compared to losing root. Richard Markert Tasker is interesting but never felt the need for it. Adaway, titanium are both irrelevant on my S7, I despise gestures beyond simple swiping in the Cardinal directions, and if stock Android is so perfect why do you need to theme it? C64 I have a s7 edge and the stockrom is full of bloatware from Microsoft, Sansung and Google. More than 20 useless apps are included. So yes the s7 needed root. tim242 Wrong. Package Disabler, no root required. Richard Markert No, it doesn't. Everything not necessary for function is disableable. C64 You can't disable everything Muzzy996 Never said android is perfect, if it was there wouldn't be any competition in the market or users such as myself who feel the need to customize Android. Root is not something I push onto others, its just something that I want on my devices and I make choices about what services I use or devices I purchase based upon my ability to do it. Railwayman I take that you like ads, then? Using a non-rooted Samsung without Taller would be like using a feature phone again but with ads. Having an automated device without ads and bloat is certainly a basic requirement to me. Richard Markert Adhell and Disconnect pro. What's an ad? Railwayman I don't see any ads on my Ericsson GF388 either. Don't have to install a single piece of software in order to get there. Ericsson win, Samsung loose.:) Your Samsung still has Google ad services and so forth running even if you are blocking them on the "non root level". My devices are completely ad free with Google ads disabled system wide and in all apps. Samsung loose every time even if their followers are trying to find different "non root methods" to "solve" things that other devices do without any issues due to... root. kostas110 maybe if you use some 500+ euro smartphone from 2016-2017 something that not everyone can do C64 I disagree, Android is one big advertising if you don't use root. Apps have ads (not every app has a pro version), internet browsing sucks without Adaway (build in ad blockers in browsers aren't great), YouTube really sucks if it isn't modded (watch a 30 second ad for a 3 minute movie). And devices are full of bloatware that can't be removed without root. Even the Google stuff are bloatware (kiosk, movies,music,books etc). I also like to remove alot of system apps and replace them with my own apps that i prefer (file manager, agenda, email, music/ video player) and i really hate duplicate apps on my devices. Also Titanium Backup is important to me. So Android​ without root isn't Android for me. jetscreamer01 I use adguard to block stupid ads in my apps. Now using any commercial apps is enjoyable. Richard Markert Samsung's Internet has the Adblock extension and it literally blocks everything. I also use Disconnect Pro and Adhell for system-wide ad blocking. Titanium Backup I never really used even back when I was rooting phones - it has been replaced 100% by Smart Switch. But then, I haven't needed to restore a backup (except for switching devices) in years, probably because I don't run janky community junkroms. Muzzy996 The only reason you feel that Smart Switch completely replaces Titanium is because you never used other features of Titanium that go beyond what Smart Switch is intended for. Things like shortcuts to freeze/defrost apps, multiple version backups or market management are useful to some even if they're on rooted stock OEM ROMs. They're not must haves for the masses though but some of us do appreciate their usefulness. Cyber_Akuma I hate this response. If anything, I have found far more reasons to root than ever before. Being able to create a backup image and install security/tracking software tat can't just be wiped/uninstalled easily is a big one for example. DJMix I really couldn't understand these kind of stupid moves. I mean I kinda get for an Android Pay or some banking apps to implement these limitations. But seriously, a frickin' streaming app? Afraid they're gonna get pirated? For someone who's going to pirate, they probably could just probably reverse engineer the apk and remove the limitations or basically use older apps. Do they really have some idle engineers that they're forced to implement useless feature? ddevito Guess I'll just pirate it all soon. Their loss. JD Fuck Android If OEMs would fucking provide updates for 5 years I wouldn't need to unlock my bootloader. I'm out. I'll come back when Google fixes this shit. Also fuck Netflix. Back to pirating it is. Christopher Bement My app stopped working on my N7 when I sideloaded 5.0. Got an error when trying to play anything. I went and dropped it back to stock on the latest patch and relocked the bootloader. All working fine now. Too fucking bad, Nougat is fantastic on that device, leaps and bounds better than Marshmallow. tehboogieman Which ROM and which N7 do you have? I still have the stock ROM on my 2013 N7 LTE and have been procrastinating loading an N ROM on it Christopher Bement 2013 LTE version and I was using Nitrogen OS (fantastic and stable ROM). I am now on the latest Marshmallow just so that Netflix will work. tehboogieman As long as I can side load it and sign in I'm still ok. It's a pain, but I'd live with that. But if NF blocks root users from signing in, I'm definitely cancelling and just use one of the very easy pirate apps. Fedup As long as you can side load... Sure. But going from "hidden app in the Play store" to "sideloaded app won't run" is probably on the menu. Wayne Randall I just signed up for Netflix so I could cancel it. I'm part of the group. tim242 You paid them... Richard Markert Hahahahahaha I don't even use Netflix on my phone (screen is too small) so I don't care. But man, the tears and butthurt from the root community is hilarious. Benjamin Walburn You're a very petty child. Richard Markert When something makes me laugh, I point it out. I do that even have a dog in this hunt. I only watch Netflix on my 75" LED TV. I'm just tired of root users smugness. Almost as smug as apple users. Benjamin Walburn You're tired of people being smug in their hobbies, so you gloat about the problems inflicted on them pointlessly? Petty and a hypocrite. Richard Markert What else am I supposed to do to remove the smugness? My name is…. Get a life maybe? Benjamin Walburn Why should you? Is another person's happiness really that painful for you? You already know that they accomplished nothing more than "successfully followed instructions." It seems like your purpose would be better served by targeting that, not just being a jerk. Humbling them is one thing, being an ass is another entirely. tim242 You sound like the petty child. Stomp your foot, becauseyou don't get your way. Benjamin Walburn Not only am I not doing that, I'm not not getting my way, and "stomping​ my foot" is not an example of pettiness. Your wrongness-density is impressive. My name is…. Who beat you as a child? Richard Markert Lol koiulpoi You're on androidpolice.com... making fun of the root community... and unable to see past the end of your nose... Don't you have anything better to do? Richard Markert Actually, no. I read Android police because they have the best coverage of software. koiulpoi I didn't realize I replied to you twice. You're all over this article, with really, nothing better to do, huh? Richard Markert Yeah, I'm bored. I'm probably done stirring shit up anyway, today is water change day on my fish tanks. lomsha Tard Railwayman Are you one of those Samsung Apologists that argue against root and proudly tell everyone about the perfection known as Grace UX... just to install Package Dsabler Pro because... something disturb all "perfectness" of their system? Trying to be an "anti-social elitist" is like proudly use Simple Finder on a Mac and tell everyone that you don't need the regular Finder.;) Richard Markert I use Samsung, but only because it offers the best mix of software and hardware for me. And package disablers are garbage. Railwayman I avoid Samsung like a plague because of Knox 0x1 Warranty Void, Grace UX (TW...) and pretty ugly hardware not to mention the software design, which looks like a cheap toy, both colors, design and all S-This and S-That they preinstall. Don't forget DT Ignite so the carriers can add their share. It is always amusing when the Samsung Apologist proudly claim how good it is to live without root and how "mature Android has become" when they are talking about a heavily modified fork of it. If Samsung could replace Google Play with Galaxy Apps, they would. The only thing restricting them from further modification is the CTS in order to be able to use Play. An unrooted Samsung running Grace? It would be like having a feature phone again. Way too many annoyances and no way of making it more pleasurable since the whole thing is... Samsung. The only area where there are some reminiscence of Android is under the About box. Samsung is a disgrace not to mention a complete parody on the concept of an Android device. Not to mention their followers who recently "spotted" the bezel less display (introduced by Sharp and LG followed by Xiaomi) because... the S 8 got it AND suddenly made it a "requirement". The most kind thing I can say about that brand is this: Samsung is for the Android device and platform what McDonald's is for the thing called food.;) There are way better devices available. Buying a Samsung is like getting a Big Mac (the difference is that the Big Mac buyers doesn't claim its superiority - while Samsung buyers always try to claim how "superior" their devices are). Richard Markert Everything in your first paragraph is purely subjective. I find the design of the Pixel to be ugly, boring and derivative. AOSP design language doesn't appeal to me. I also think Samsung's software suite is better than Google's. My 935U doesn't have DTIgnite, but my 935V does...as does the Verizon branded V20, Moto Turbo2, etc. DTIgnite is a Verizon thing. Bezel less phones are sexy, for sure. That Sharp device was a Sharp device, and the Xiaomi has a CDMA radio so I could use it on Verizon , but just can't justify buying a thousand dollar device from China. It is stupidly gorgeous though. I use Samsung because I like the software design. I like the functionality of the base is and apps, and I like the S-app suite. I really miss my Note 7, and I'll be swapping up to a Note 8 when it's out. Don't get me wrong, Samsung phones have their negatives - chief among them is the fragile design and the screen edge touch rejection sucks ass. But for me, the positives outweigh the negatives. Other phones have bigger negatives for me. No IP68, no uSD card, no wireless charging, no SAMOLED display. Phone preference are always subjective. Somebody will always have a reason to pick one over another. Tell me, if Samsung is a "parody" of the concept of an Android device, what is your description of the perfect Android device? I'm guessing it's the Pixel. Railwayman Pixel is an ugly iPhone clone. The best Android device so far would be something like a Xiaomi Mi Mix running Resurrection Remix or similar ROM or something like a Mi Max but with perfection added through a Snapdragon 835, 256GB storage plus microSDand 6-8GB RAM paired with a 1440p 6.44" display or even 4K. 5000-6000 mAh battery. My Xiaomi Mi Max is excellent but would be even better with the aforementioned hardware (I can't fault is existing hardware but I am taking about a new model). A keyboard flipcover would be a great accessory as well. There are no device yet worthy of the perfect moniker yet but my Max is the best thing so far in my collection beside the Nokia Communicators and HTC TP2 and HD2 and also the Xperia Z Ultra when I do the holistic judgment. IP68? Sony all the way to me if I really insist. MicroSD? No need for a Samsung in order to get it. Yes, Samsung is a kind of a parody of an Android device die to their heavy modifications, restrictive policies, low price /performance ratio, carrier branding and Knox 0x1 Warranty Void. The upcoming OnePlus 5 looks promising - they usually get their things right. MicroSD on that one as well.;) If Samsung make a device without any BS such as restrictions, carrier links paired with good price / performance ratio I would be interested. Let's call it a Note Pro. What I don't like with Samsung are all Apologists making excuses for their policies. I have nothing against them as a company or production. They can make excellent products but their policies stop them right now. It is too much McDonald's mainstream and too little class at this time. Carrier devices are typically too mainstream than the unlocked ones. MadMartigan What are are you, seven? me me A primary reason to root is to run adblock because Google is way too greedy. So the irony, Google's greed means there's less reason to pay for NetFlix. Let me guess... shall we? Google Play Movies still works right...? Oh yes, so long as Google makes their money.... tim242 I block ads with Adguard. No root required. Mike | Homeless On Wheels People still use Netflix? Bit Torrent is your friend. dizel123 Exactly. Everyone should stop using Netflix. Not sure how I'm gonna get the shows i currently watch on Netflix from bit torrent since they won't be made anymore once Netflix is shut down, but at least I'll have my bit torrent friend tim242 Some people like to do things properly. Railwayman You mean - Do it with DRM? You can't buy whatever device you want because a content provider disagree. You can't use the system you want because a content provider disagree. You can't use the app you want because a content provider disagree. I need a lot of apps, ads and limitations for the so called "proper way" . The "improper way" is Samsung free, ad free and bloat free - and I don't need several apps because I have just one or two streaming apps, one media player, one book reader and so on. Fast and efficient system to boot. I think I prefer to do things "improperly". Richard Markert >The "improper way" is Samsung free, ad free and bloat free - and I don't need several apps because I have just one or two streaming apps, one media player, one book reader and so on. Fast and efficient system to boot. *sigh* I bet you think deleting the APKs from /system actually gives you more space in /data, too. Railwayman Perhaps you can tell me the benefit of having Kindle, Kobo and Nook instead of MoonReader for everything. The benefits of having an uprooted system, Netflix, Hulu and a couple of apps for different cable services instead of having just one media center would also be interesting to know more about. When we are at it: Why would I want to use a 3GB+ Samsung ROM when Resurrection Remix are 600 MB and the G-Apps around 340 MB? Richard Markert I dont use any of those. Phones are too small for media consumption. I don't have any video streaming or playback apps on my phone. Nor do I have book readers, but why wouldnt I want Kindle? It's the only way to access the Amazon library... Oh wait, I forgot, you do that believe in compensating content creators. Resurrection remix, really? If I put that on my S7 edge, I'd be wiping out half the hardware's capabilities in one blow. No Samsung pay, no edge panels, no pro mode camera, no AOD, no game tools, no GearVR. And im sure none of the little things I've come to expect in my UI, like direct calling and sliding a contact to call/txt. But I can move the clock to the other side of the notification shade, woohoo! Oh and does the installer for RR rom repartition the file system? Because if not, /system will still be 3gb, not 600mb. And on top of that, I'm immediately reminded of iOS when I looked at their screenshots. Railwayman So RR looks like iOS? Interesting. It looks like Android with Material Design on my device. I buy Kindle books but send them through a plug-in since the Kindle app pretty much suck in comparison with MoonReader. Sometimes I also buy from Google Play Books and it is also a trip through the plug-in for them and then into the MoonReader library. You see - DRM is a stupidity that must go way unless they create a device wide scheme so any app can authenticate and show or play back the content. I understand that Samsung phones are too small for media consumption. A 6.44-7 inch display is different - it works comfortably without the heft of a 10-12 inch tablet. Small displays below 6-6.3 inches are just too small. So your listed features of your Samsung are hardware? They certainly sound like software to me. Or do you seriously believe that Samsung use co-processors in their device like Commodore did on the Amiga? I can assure you that your Samsung contain standard hardware with a lot of subcontracted components, especially in the US market where they even use Qualcomm CPUs. Samsung Pay? Why would I use an OEM dependent payment system? My credit cards follow a standard, why should I pick myself into a specific device OEM just to pay? It makes no sense. It is like having a car that only runs on Citgo gas or a 4" Visa card requiring different terminals than my 4.5" MasterCard. Mobile payments will be a thing when a standard are in place. Payment systems requiring me to lock myself into a specific OEM just suck. Edge panels? Don't see the need. Don't like Edge displays with their optical side effects. Flat display or just slight roundness on the edges like the BlackBerry PRIV here. Pro Mode Camera? I prefer to have the Open Camera API so any app can get RAW from the sensor and do their thing rather than locking myself into the default camera app. I prefer Camera FV-5 or A Better Camera etc. The Snap Camera is good too. Always on display? Can set it up on my device but don't see the need when there are things such as Active Display and a lot of other options. Game tools? I don't see any problems with gaming on other Android versions so I just don't see what Samsung can add in this regard. Gear VR? Why would I want to strap my device to my face when there are dedicated VR headsets available for gaming consoles and computers? I certainly prefer to have a full headset rather than using my device as one. Call features? They could be good but carrier calling is old fashioned. I use Google Voice instead and wouldn't consider going back to carrier talk and text. Don't see any benefit with having a phone number tied to a carrier of SIM card. Having more than one for different purposes on the same device without SIM dependency is the modern way. I don't know if RR repartition Samsung devices so you have to check XDA. That brand is probably the worst when it comes to ROMs anyway and a lot of my dislike of them are related to that particular issue. Samsung is nothing more than the Big Mac of Android devices and no Gear VR or Samsung Pay (it is like having a McDonald's Pay) really change anything. A mainstream device with mainstream design with too many round edges and corners not to say fragile, batteries that wear out fast due to lower quality and fast charge (which stresses the cells heavily), a software design looking "something" , bloat ware, carrier BS such as bloat ware and also the price model, Knox and root/ROM restrictions, locked bootloadern - the list goes on and on. Mainstream degenerated art is what Samsung represents. But I know the existence of people who don't believe in freedom of choice other than the freedom of buying their Samsung from their carrier and then happily oblige and reduction imposed to them all the way down to the SIM card dependent phone number and roaming charges when they travel.;) They also consider Samsung Pay to be the best thing ever - a payment system that only work on a particular OEM. It really is like a car that require Citgo gas and is unable to run on Exxon or Esso fuel. Samsung just are the Big Mac of Android devices. There are just nothing "classy" over such a carrier mainstream brand. If you want to know what luxury are? Look at Vertu. derp_cookies So I agree this is a dumb move but everyone is overreacting by threatening to pirate content. This is a niche problem as less people root now, especially since Android pay won't work when you do it. So Netflix isn't any less accessible than it was before. I watch 99% of Netflix at home on my Roku. Luxferro It's not just rooting. My Nexus 6P is running stock google rom, no root, w/ just unlocked bootloader, and netflix is gone in my play store. Not that I watch TV on my phone... but my shield tv is also unlocked... so it's probably just a matter of time. Roh_Mish Dammit Netflix, you make me want to go popcorn time route. My current primary phone and my iPad are what I use to watch netflix and both of them is stock so i don't have anything to worry about but this just feels wrong. Between this and Amazon not releasing the TV app for my sony TV, which they support outside, popcorn time (and in extension piracy) just seems easier. Vivek Rameses This is why we have piracy. Miguel Angel But ...why? occono Distributors want Netflix to stop any possibility of making DRM-Free backups on the content. Railwayman Good luck with that. If it can be played, it can be recorded. As long as the Netflix content is visible somewhere a copy can be recorded so again, good luck with blocking. Mariano Moreira Even more strange is while Netflix app is removed from Playstore, Netflix VR is still.in Playstore. Manually flashing Factory Image for Google Pixel is how I get me OS updates and I choose to leave bootloader unlocked, rather than relocking every month.(which would include full wipe) So I guess they don't care about security for the few users whom might use Netflix VR with Daydream compatible device? tehboogieman I'm not familiar with the Pixel, but almost every Nexus device lets you lock without wiping all your data. Maybe that requires root though, I really don't understand the details on how it works, but hopefully you can find a way to do it. Mariano Moreira To clarify: In order for me to install Factory Image every month, I need to have Bootloader unlocked. Doing the Factory unlock will wipe the device. Locking the device doesn't wipe the device, but Factory unlocking the bootloader will wipe the device. tehboogieman Yeah, sorry I wasn't more specific. I use an app called BootUnlocker. It lets you lock and unlock the bootloader without wiping at will. Since an app can do this, I'm assuming that it can be done via ADB. Also it might only work on older devices, but maybe there's a way to replicate this action on newer devices as well Mariano Moreira I don't understand why Google is promoting Security by having the device fully-locked, yet still relies on ADB fastboot unlock/OEM Unlock commands to flash factory images? saf1927 Why are using factory images when Google provides OTA images too, and these don't require an unlocked bootloader, nor a wipe? jdrch It's not just Netflix. The HDHomeRun Prime app doesn't work on rooted 7.0+ devices either. Jsilvermist Good to know, will no longer recommend Netflix to anyone when I'm asked... James F News flash: when you explain to most normal people why you don't recommend Netflix, they won't care, because it doesn't affect them. D13H4RD2L1V3 This is stupid. I had to root my phone to be able to hide the navbar at any time I want and also to gain better battery management controls and other stuff that I sorely wished Google had added to stock Android way sooner. And I was considering a Netflix subscription. No longer...... Sruly J I know it's not fully a solution which is "worth it", but the app Custom Navigation Bar offers the ability to hide status bar/narbar without root. Although like you said, you had other reasons to root, so... Diar I pay for Netflix so I can watch the content any way I want guilt free, whether that's their app or other locations on the Internet. F their VPN blocking and DRM. If they make their app impossible to use, I just won't use it. They'll still get my money but they will lose any data/tracking since I'll still be watching their shows, just outside of their ecosystem. Dummies. ReedSolomon Between the SJW nonsense like Bill Nye, the ipv6 tunnel blocking (rather than simply defaulting to ipv4), increases in price, less and less quality content, and now this, I see little reason to keep paying for Netflix. robogo I understand Netflix' reasons, I really do - they need to protect their property and investment. But I can't really say I understand the way they're doing this. This is a good way to alienate the small percentage of power users who root their devices for various, but perfectly valid and understandable reasons. And no, this will not make me cancel my membership as long as the app works. Cancelling membership is a silly, overblown reaction to what is, in my mind, a minor nuisance. D13H4RD2L1V3 I personally just find it a dumb move. Seems like an easy way out. Dmitri Smirnov > perfectly valid and understandable reasons. And what reason would that be? Preventing people from ripping their content? Doesn't stop them in the slightest, root-detection in circumvented rather easily as well as safety net, we have PokemonGo to thank for that - a lot of people were motivated to crack it and they succeeded. > Cancelling membership is a silly, overblown reaction to what is, in my mind, a minor nuisance. Cancelling membership is valid form of feedback to the company, that trying to tell it's customers that they are not allowed to own their device that they paid their money for, if they want to watch a movie. robogo You misunderstood, it seems. A perfectly valid and understandable reason to root one's device would be, e.g. Xposed framework, theming support, tethering, backing up stuff with Titanium Backup, etc. Please read my comment once again. EowynCarter Well, if and when it stops working on my phone, what will be a major nuisance. robogo Agreed. I'll have to find another way then. But I'll deal with that when the time comes. Manbearpig I member when netflix released there app for Android and they did the same thing. I would just download the app and be good to go. After awhile though I stop rooting I miss it sometimes Cyber_Akuma I warned people when Pokemon GO of all things had a surprise update that silently added SafetyNet that this garbage was going to become more and more common. Mario RUN uses it too, and now Netflix.... soon apps everywhere are going to add SafetyNet and block rooted devices as standard practice. Google has been incredibly hostile towards people who actually want to own or have control over their devices or even their PC Software over the last few years. And over the last year google has been making SafetyNet more and more harsh, now even tripping if your BOOTLOADER is unlocked even if your phone is not rooted. Pokemon GO and Mario RUN were a small crowd, but I hope after Netflix of all things starts using it (and make no mistake, this is just the beginning) that people will finally push back against Google's hostility towards rooted users. EowynCarter Yeah. Or I might seriously consider going the iOS way. Though iOS would pose other problems. (Bye paylib) BillPosters I rooted my Android phone to get rid of the annoying camera shutter sound, and to prevent apps from stealing my contacts, and to basically take control of my device rather than letting Google run the whole show, and because of that I can't update Netflix? Good riddance Netflix. iKon I'm pretty sure you can go in the camera settings and take of the camera shutter sound?.... .. In some region-specific firmware versions or certain devices you can't do that. Railwayman There is a better solution: Declare the device a DRM free zone and use everything else. DRM to me is "Don't Restrict Me!" and an excellent reason to give certain companies the middle finger telling them to just go and F themselves. The most ironic thing here is that removing Netflix or using DRM otherwise doesn't stop piracy. On the contrary - By buying and using DRM content you get to travel in the cargo hold with no heating while the pirating consumer get first class service: more content, no restrictions, no copyright trailers or ads before the movie start and stop on. Even better: They can use whatever apps or ROMs they want. Would I unroot my device in order to get DRM content onboard? No way!!! If Netflix are so scared - block the client on Mac OS X and Windows et al. Piracy doesn't usually happen with an Android device as a source but rather computers and HDCP rippers. Another thing also to the DRM companies: Everything that can be played back can be recorded! (Good old piracy saying) Netflix out, Fusion with Exodus, SALTS and Phoenix in. Kodi with Rapier skin is much nicer than the Netflix client and Trakt integration make this way a much better one than going down the DRM route, sitting with an uprooted stock ROM and Netflix.;) TechJunkie198 ? netflix isn't scared. the studios require the drm. and netflix isn't concerned with the small percent of users who root their devices. Railwayman Doesn't matter. Go and enjoy your DRM services.;) DRM is a pest and that is why the pirating community offer a superior product. It is easier and more hassle free to just put Netflix where they belong and use Exodus et al or MovieBox or Terrarium TV and so on. To those who now consider unrooting because of Netflix: Just don't - use other services instead. Richard Markert So when everybody takes your advice and uses a service that doesn't compensate anybody in the content creation business, and all the high-quality media is gone, don't go crying about there being nothing good to steal anymore, k? Railwayman Even better: DRM and proprietary vendor lock in are scrapped and replaced by standards. If they want some kind of protection - make it device wide and linked to the account signed in so playback works in different apps - only thing needed is to call the system wide authentication system. I am against DRM and vendor restrictions. Original content without any of the BS is what the world need. Piracy is a symptom of several problematic things such as geo restrictions, root restrictions and the failed idea of the "right of no distribution" - i.e. the content exist but stubborn companies deny distribution using silly arguments. I always remove DRM from purchased content in order to have full control including the basic right of using whatever app or equipment for playback. Richard Markert Start developing the solution, and start a content creation company that can compete with the big boys when it comes to quality content. Or, you can sit around and whine online about the content creators not wanting the people who don't follow rules to play in their gated sandbox and get mad when you crawl over the fence. Railwayman I take that you like DRM and proprietary vendor lock-in. It is easy to avoid the gated sandbox so no need to whine. It is easier to just fire up Exodus rather than relocking the bootloader and flashing a stock ROM or remove SuperSU in favor of Magisk just to be able to get Netflix. DRM is such a waste of time. It's not necessary to develop a new service since the content are available DRM free already. Standards for media and books etc does exist or did you miss EPUB, PDF, AAC, MP3, MP4 and so on? Perhaps you prefer such a format as ZNO or Apple modified EPUB that only works with iBooks? saf1927 Magisk seems to do the trick. Helios What about my non-rooted OnePlus One? It's also listed as incompatible.. '-_- 天地人 Don't OnePlus devices run a custom ROM and have unlocked bootloaders? Android Developer How can they block people who root the device from installing the app? The play store doesn't have this filter. Maybe after the install they do this check? Richard Markert If you're really an Android Developer, you would know that SafetyNet is what's doing this "behind the scenes". Android Developer I'm talking about the article. They say that Netflix blocks rooted devices, and I know that this isn't an option on the developer console. Google doesn't have anything related to rooted devices there. Ezio I have about 200 original blu-ray disks, go to cinema, and I'm Netflix subscriber. Now I won't get app updates (or even worse I won't be able to use it in the future) just because I like to use my custom rom. Thank you. This is really a bad move. AdjustedFlow I thought netflix was about providing a better service than piracy. Now they're literally pushing me back to piracy. What the heck? Dany If for "root" they mean administrator privileges, don't we already have that on windows 10? So why Netflix doesn't block desktop version too? P.S. by the way...whatever man! I was using Kodi more than this crap anyway... Miku is Best Vocaloid This means Netflix won't be getting my business anymore. Paul Sterling No worries here, when you're legit. Take my money, I'm not cheap. Give me a service, I'll pay you. I don't need to rob. What am I? 13 living with my mom using Napster? Naw, grew up. Don't have any Tim foil hats. My wallet grew up too. ast00 This is a dick move that could have been avoided. If they want us to pirate their content instead, we will pirate their content. We tried doing it the legal way, but they didn't allow it. Their problem, not ours. EowynCarter Umf. **checks google play ** No longer compatible with my nexus 6 . But nexus 4 still ok. For crying out loud! I'm not rooted or using a custom ROM. Pyramid Power netflix is just losing money. it's saying to those people, 'go to thepiratebay!' RemiV2 I guess I'll just keep torrenting then. Thanks, Netflix.

Netflix is a client app. If I can, with a rooted phone, fake my subscription, or somehow cause a major security issue, that is not a problem with me, that is a problem with you pushing out a vulnerable app to millions of users. Sure, it would be my fault for exploiting it, but there is no-one but you who managed to put the problem in place. A CLIENT app should not be anything but a front-end representation of an API run by your servers. The CLIENT should have nothing but a CLIENT ID to use with the API. The CLIENT should NOT be able to change JACK SHIT with the API, it should only be able to get search results, get access to encrypted streams, etc. If your client CAN change JACK SHIT (which one could assume is true, since you are so actively hiding your code) then you have a major security vulnerability... This is a problem with your code, not anyone's rooted device... Hell, you don't even need a rooted device to access the applications code, just download an APK of the app, extract it, and decompile it... Jesus netflix, get your shit straight you bendy pos... BahnStormer Netflix is used more on tablets and TV boxes, these tend to be used for several years longer than phones and even Google now only updates their devices for <2 years (Samsung / streamer manufacturer's do this even less!)... We HAVE to run the likes of Lineage if we want the devices to be secure! Bye bye Netflix, even Amazon Video lets us use rooted devices! jcopernicus People don't understand IP and lambast a company protecting it. Of course. RemixedCat well they got rid of 5 star ratings, deleted tons of shows I was in the middle of, and the roku app is hella slow and takes 10 freakin minutes to load (by comparison my OS install from power on to desktop was 8 minutes on my samsung 850 500GB SSD!!) Tobi I'm running LineageOS on my Oneplus One to lengthen the lifespan of my device. Why must I be punished for that? I'm going back to pirating content. StankyChikin Possible that the movie industry is pushing this? SkullOne Shhhhh. Don't use logic here. It's not allowed. It's simply easier to blame Netflix and believe that they have a vendetta against the teeny tiny, itsy bitsy amount of root users out there! StankyChikin Forgive me plz lol username_not_valid This isnt about Netflix, its about its content providers. There is this notion that you can copy files and therefore pirate content if you are rooted. We all know its rubbish, Netflix probably knows its rubbish, but that doesn't change anything. If Netflix wants shows, its has to abide by its license agreements. There is really nothing Netflix, Amazon, Sky or any other streaming service can do about it. The fact that almost all pirate content comes from PCs and HDCP by-pass devices doesnt mean a thing. TedPhillips at least in practice, unlocking your bootloader/being rooted has no impact on your widevine support level. now, i'm not sure if the oem could supply a high-level drm library on a pre-rooted device, due to agreements, but modification after the point of sale is a different matter. meanwhile, keep on streaming netflix on your 'rooted' computer - gasp!~ Richard Markert >meanwhile, keep on streaming netflix on your 'rooted' computer - gasp!~ I don't even need an admin account to steal Netflix on my PC. Since the Windows 10 app and browsers BOTH work over analog, all I need is an inline box with a DSUB VGA connector and simply capture the entire output from the VGA port. Valerie Frye-Preter Did they do this because of the stolen season 5 of Orange is the New Black? TedPhillips wasn't that stolen before it was available for streaming? so i don't see how it could be. TedPhillips when the device can be retroactively uncertified, as safetynet mutates over time, that's a step beyond the usual forced obsolescence of artificially short software support windows. now instead of buying a new phone every 18-24 months, it could be literally whenever they feel like moving the goalposts. Mike Hunt I don't understand. I am a Netflix subscriber, but will probably have to unsubscribe now since I bought a rooted Chinese mediabox for my TV. This sucks, as I liked and supported NetFlix's business model. Richard Markert Which box do you have? Mike Hunt One of these https://www.aliexpress.com/wholesale?catId=0&initiative_id=SB_20170514131212&SearchText=media+box+mini+m8s Brock Reed I'm not even getting the "not compatible" message, it's just not showing up at all. Ajmobileguru First DirecTV Now and now Netflix. I dont see the point. As if rooted users were pirating the streams or movies. Rooted users on non-nexus/pixel devices already were getting only 480p because of widewine crap and now this. Anunnaki This is why people switch to apps like Popcorn Time and Terrarium TV. Biga173rd Popcorn time still works? Anunnaki When I last checked few months ago, it was working. No idea about the current situation though. Biga173rd Okay Erin Andrews Oh that's easy, they block my device I cancel my subscription.

Fedup Let's see... Piracy: $0.00, no ads, no DRM, no device/location/time restrictions Legit: $$$, ads out the as$, DRM limiting options, shows locked to specific devices, locations, etc. Keep on making the decision easier for us, Netflix. xyz Fortunately, the Pirate Bay is accessible from all devices and regions without any geo-blocking. berserksgangr Well, my Nexus 7 with Lineage it's not working even without root (error 9) Nick Riley This is utterly stupid! Corvus Dove Remember that time that making things more difficult for software and media pirates through DRM while possibly messing with legitimate customers paid off and prevented piracy? Me either. Asbjørn The problem here is that most users root their phone to get the updates that their OEM doesn't want to make available. If Android had proper updates, rooting would not be so necessary.

The production companies they purchase shows off are notoriously backward when it comes to technology and unfortunately Netflix relies on them to survive.

The ruling by District Judge William Alsup in San Francisco Monday was mainly a victory for Waymo, the autonomous car unit spun off from Google. Waymo showed "compelling evidence" that a former Waymo engineer named Anthony Levandowski downloaded thousands of confidential files before leaving the company, the order said. Levandowski set up his own firms, which then were sold to Uber for $680 million. Evidence showed that Levandowski and Uber planned the acquisitions before Levandowski left Waymo, Alsup's order said. FILE- In this Dec. 13, 2016, file photo, Anthony Levandowski, head of Uber's self-driving program, speaks about their driverless car in San Francisco. In an order filed Monday, May 15, 2017, a federal judge ordered Uber to stop using technology that Levandowski downloaded before he left Waymo, the Alphabet Inc. autonomous car arm that was spun off from Google. The order filed Monday in a trade secrets theft lawsuit also forces Uber to return all downloaded materials. (AP Photo/Eric Risberg, File) "He clearly believes that Levandowski is guilty as sin and that Uber hired him, knowing this full well," said John Coffee, a Columbia University law professor who specializes in white-collar crime and corporate governance. "He is ruling that some of this information is stolen (or "misappropriated") and in the long run that will likely have a devastating impact on Uber." Waymo sued Uber in February alleging that the ride-hailing company is using stolen self-driving technology to build its own autonomous cars. Monday's ruling prevents Uber from using the technology on a laser navigational tool called Lidar that robotic cars use to see what's around them. "The bottom line is the evidence indicates that Uber hired Levandowski even though it knew or should have known that he possessed over 14,000 confidential Waymo files," Alsup wrote. "At least some information from those files, if not the files themselves, has seeped into Uber's own Lidar development efforts." Uber was ordered to return all downloaded materials to Waymo by noon on May 31. Alsup ordered Uber to remove Levandowski from any role in Lidar, and that it stop him from copying or otherwise using the downloaded materials. Waymo sought to shut down Uber's Lidar research that it says uses Waymo files and patented technology until the dispute is settled. But Alsup determined that Waymo's patent infringement theories were too weak to support such an order. The judge ruled that although it's hard to imagine that Levandowski "plundered Waymo's vault the way he did" with no intent to use the material, Waymo still fell short of showing that the trade secrets were used. Uber said in a statement Monday that it's pleased the court allowed it to continue the research, including its own Lidar innovations. "We look forward to moving toward trial and continuing to demonstrate that our technology has been built independently from the ground up," the statement said. Messages were left Monday for lawyers representing Levandowski and the companies he formed. Waymo, which is part of Google parent Alphabet Inc., said it welcomed the order stopping Uber from using "stolen documents containing trade secrets." The ruling, coupled with Alsup's order last week referring the case to federal prosecutors, signals that Alsup is leaning toward Waymo based on evidence thus far, said Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond. Alsup's order suggests there's evidence that Levandowski could face federal prosecution, and there's circumstantial evidence that Uber may have violated federal trade secret theft laws, said Barbara McQuade, a former U.S. Attorney in Detroit who now is a law professor at the University of Michigan. Federal law covers both the person who stole a trade secret and anyone who "receives, buys or possesses it, knowing the same to have been stolen," McQuade said. A civil remedy may not be adequate in this case since Levandowski has invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination when questioned by Waymo attorneys, she said. The high-stakes case now will proceed to evidence exchanges between both sides and will go to trial if not settled, Tobias said. That could take months or more than a year. The ruling will hamper Uber's ability to develop a self-driving car more quickly than Waymo, Coffee said, but it's too early to say if Uber will be crippled by the ruling. Levandowski formed Ottomotto, a self-driving vehicle startup, on Jan. 15, 2016. Twelve days later, he resigned from Waymo without any notice. The following August, Uber bought Ottomotto and hired Levandowski to lead its self-driving car efforts. Last week Alsup took the rare step of referring the case to federal prosecutors for an investigation of possible criminal misconduct. The U.S. Attorney's Office in San Francisco hasn't responded to requests for comment. Also Monday, Waymo confirmed that it is teaming up to test autonomous vehicles with Lyft, Uber's main ride-hailing competitor, in a potential challenge to Uber. ____ Auto Writer Dee-Ann Durbin contributed to this report.

It isn't easy, but here are a few pointers to help. Image: Fitbit Fortunately for those looking to consolidate their health and fitness data, most of these services have APIs, so there are options for pooling stats from different devices and apps. It's what Google and Apple have been trying to do with their own health and fitness portals, though with a limited amount of success so far. Using Google Fit Image: Google Google Fit now comes as standard on Nexus and Pixel devices, using the sensors packed into your phone (or Android Wear watch) to keep track of steps, sleep, and other measurements automatically. As you would expect from Google, it's slick and available on the web, but we're yet seeing much in the way of support from non-Google devices, even though Google Fit was first announced way back in summer 2014. Image: Screenshot There are a decent number of apps that work with Fit: Strava, Sleep As Android, and Runtastic, for example, so if you use these apps to track your running, walking, sleeping, and workouts then Google Fit is a decent option for consolidating everything in one place. What's missing is direct compatibility with the major wearable makers, the likes of Fitbit and Misfit, though Withings devices are supported. Compatible apps (here's a list) are usually connected from within each individual app's settings, so you'll need to dig around to find the option. From within the Google Fit app on Android, choose Settings from the menu then tap Apps connected to see what's piping data into Google Fit. Using Apple Health Image: Apple It's a similar story with Apple Health as it is for Google Fit — strong integration with Apple's own kit and support for some big-name apps, but more limited compatibility with actual devices you might be wearing on your body (unless it's the Apple Watch). Health is much broader in scope than Fit, acting as a repository for all of your medical data, not just the number laps your ran this morning. It also goes into greater depth when analysing your progress and making recommendations about where you can improve (like when to stop and take a breath). Image: Screenshot There's no easy way of checking which apps work with Apple Health and which don't, but as with Google Fit, Strava and Runtastic have joined the party, and Health links to apps from Misfit, Withings and Garmin too, so you can in theory use any of their wearables and pipe data through the default apps then on to Apple Health. Fitbit is the big hold-out. As with Google Fit, access is granted to Apple Health through the individual apps. Tap the Sources link on the front page of the Health app to see what you've linked up and adjust which variables each of the apps is allowed to edit. Using IFTTT Image: Screenshot We're unashamed fans of IFTTT (If This Then That), and the service plugs into just about every fitness tracking API out there including Fitbit, Jawbone, Withings, Misfit, Strava and more. This makes it even broader in scope than the offerings from Google and Apple. It's a shame then that IFTTT doesn't work with Google Fit or Apple Health directly. IFTTT isn't a repository for your data either, so once you've collected all the information from your various trackers and apps, you need to put it somewhere else. Fortunately, there are lots of options to pick from. You can pipe your statistics out to Evernote, for example, or a Google Drive spreadsheet, or OneNote, or even a blog post if you want the world to know what you're up to. A bit of trial and error might be required to get the data in the shape you need, but you've got plenty of scope for collecting and analysing feedback from multiple apps and devices. If you want to log your daily Fitbit stats to a Google Drive sheet, for example, choose Fitbit then Daily activity summary as your trigger, then Google Drive and Add row to a spreadsheet as your action. With a bit of touching up on the sheet itself, you can get a very decent-looking record of your exercise and sleep. Then you can import information from the spreadsheet into various apps. Using Exist We may well have saved the best until last. Exist draws in a ton of data from a range of fitness apps and devices, and will even go to the trouble of analysing it for you, letting you know which days you're most productive, and even how the weather affects your exercise. Exist works with Fitbit, Jawbone, Misfit, Withings, Google Fit, Apple Health (and the Apple Watch), Strava, Moves, Runkeeper and more besides. It can also pull in data from the likes of Last.fm, Spotify, Twitter, Dark Sky and RescueTime to try and chart your exercise against other factors like social media activity and how much music you're listening to. A subscription to Exist will set you back $US6 ($8) a month but there is a 30-day free trial available so you can work out whether it's for you. Once you've got yourself up and running, you can connect various services with just a few clicks. The online interface is a breeze to use and lets you dig into your stats in great detail, letting you chart different variables against each other. It also tries to pick out trends for you, letting you know everything from which music artist gets you exercising more to how your tweet patterns boost your step count. WATCH MORE: Tech News Comments Zombie Jesus @zombiejesus May 16, 2017, 11:28am No mention of Samsung Health? I really wanted Google Fit to work well but it's really underwhelming. Samsung Health does a lot more, it's just a bit weak on wearable support. But it does support connecting to a lot of third party apps, several of which can bridge your wearable into Health pretty seamlessly. Reply 0 Join the discussion!

Uber brawl sees 'suspicious' acts and 'pilfered files' The judge rules Uber's self-driving car program safe, for now, but also says its star engineer must step aside. All this and we haven't even gotten to trial. Tech Industry by Dara Kerr May 15, 2017 4:58 PM PDT @darakerr Uber's self-driving car program is safe ... for now. James Martin/CNET One thing is clear in the Waymo vs. Uber lawsuit: It's complicated. Federal Judge William Alsup sort of, kind of sided with Uber when he ruled Monday not to shutter the company's self-driving car program. But in almost the same breath, Alsup sort of, kind of sided with Waymo by agreeing that something "highly suspicious" happened with Uber's star engineer Anthony Levandowski. But let's back up. How did we get here? In February, Waymo, the self-driving car unit of Google's parent company Alphabet, filed a lawsuit against Uber alleging trade secret theft. Levandowski is at the center of the suit, with Waymo accusing him of stealing 14,000 "highly confidential" files on self-driving car technology in December 2015. Levandowski used to work at Google but quit in January 2016 to form his own self-driving truck startup, called Otto. Uber bought Otto last August for $680 million and named Levandowski head of its self-driving car program. Before Levandowski quit Google, he helped pioneer the company's autonomous vehicle program and develop its lidar technology, a key component in self-driving cars that lets vehicles "see" their surroundings and detect traffic, pedestrians, bicyclists and other obstacles. It's that lidar technology that's at the crux of the Waymo v. Uber lawsuit. Waymo claims Uber colluded with Levandowski to steal its lidar designs. Those designs, Waymo argues, have benefited Uber's driverless car tech. Uber argues that its lidar technology is "fundamentally different" from Waymo's. Self-driving cars are a hot topic in the auto and tech industries. Automakers from Toyota to Ford to Volvo all have projects under way. Besides Google and Uber, other Silicon Valley giants, including Apple, Intel and Tesla Motors, are betting on the tech. These vehicles aren't making money yet, but that could soon change. Once thought of as far-off future tech, driverless vehicles could be cruising city streets within the next 10 years, transforming the multitrillion-dollar auto industry. Google started working on self-driving cars in 2009 and has now test-driven its vehicles nearly 3 million miles. Uber launched its self-driving project in 2015 and has since rolled out autonomous vehicles on city streets in Pennsylvania, California and Arizona. What does the judge say? Judge Alsup said Uber can keep its project alive in the three states where it's operating, but that it must formally remove Levandowski as the head of the program. Uber also has to create a timeline of events regarding Levandowski being hired and "do whatever it can to ensure that its employees return 14,000-plus pilfered files to their rightful owner." In anticipation of the judge's ruling, Levandowski said last month he'd step aside as head of Uber's driverless car program and recuse himself from all lidar-related work. He remains at the company, however. "We are pleased with the court's ruling that Uber can continue building and utilizing all of its self-driving technology, including our innovation around LiDAR," an Uber spokeswoman wrote in an email. "We look forward to moving toward trial and continuing to demonstrate that our technology has been built independently from the ground up." Waymo didn't respond to requests for comment. Waymo had asked for a preliminary injunction, basically requesting that the judge shut down Uber's self-driving project. But that's easier said than done. Waymo needed to prove two things: it would suffer irreparable harm if the injunction wasn't granted and that Uber used the files Levandowski allegedly downloaded. While Waymo wasn't able to meet the bar on those two points, the evidence the company has brought forward so far convinced Alsup that something shady happened. Related stories Waymo vs. Uber lawsuit: 10 things you need to know Uber says it's not 'hiding anything' in Waymo case 11 juicy details revealed at the Waymo v. Uber hearing "Waymo has made a strong showing that Levandowski absconded with over 14,000 files from Waymo, evidently to have them available to consult on behalf of Otto and Uber," Judge Alsup wrote in his order on Monday. "Uber knew or at least should have known of the downloading but nevertheless proceeded to bring Levandowski and Otto on board." Alsup referred the case to federal prosecutors last week for a possible criminal investigation into the alleged theft of trade secrets. The Department of Justice has already opened an inquiry into Uber on its secretive "Greyball" software tool. If the DOJ decides to take the trade secrets case, prosecutors will likely look into Uber as a whole, said Phil Bezanson, attorney for the firm Bracewell. In its investigations, the DOJ tends to stress things like corporate culture, tone at the top and being a good corporate citizen, he said. "Do we just have two disconnected data points from Greyball to Levandowski's actions?" Bezanson said the government will be asking. "Or is this a larger corporate culture problem?"

A new confident report from Android Police suggests that the release of Google Assistant on iOS is “imminent” with there even being a possibility of an announcement at Google I/O 2017. It’s unknown exactly how Google plans to implement Assistant, meaning it will likely be a mixture of how it’s used in Allo and how the full-featured version works on Android. This news is huge, as Google is continuing to look for developers to expand the capabilities and usefulness of Assistant. If you remember, a few weeks ago, Google opened its Assistant SDK for any developers to being building devices to use Assistant. Since then, we have seen a few implementations which add Assistant to MacOS devices, in an effort to replace Siri altogether. Hopefully, Apple doesn’t act like a stick in the mud and reject the official Assistant app from launching onto the App Store. However, maybe there’s a chance we can see a large update to the Google Search app which will include Assistant proper. We’re sure there are a few iOS users out there that still check out Phandroid, so sound off in the comments and let us know whether you are looking forward to this integration on iOS.

Netflix confirms it is blocking rooted/unlocked devices, app itself is still working (for now) Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/13 3:08pm PDTMay 13, 2017 229 Plus 1 on G+ 1077 Share on Facebook 394 Share on Twitter Total Shares1700 Applications News Earlier today, Netflix started showing up as 'incompatible' on the Play Store for rooted and unlocked Android devices. However, the app itself continued to work fine, leading some (including myself) to think it could have been an accident. However, Netflix has now confirmed to us that blocking modified devices from downloading the app was intentional. This is the full statement: With our latest 5.0 release, we now fully rely on the Widevine DRM provided by Google; therefore, many devices that are not Google-certified or have been altered will no longer work with our latest app and those users will no longer see the Netflix app in the Play Store. If you're not familiar with it, Widevine is a Google-made DRM technology that works across various desktop and mobile platforms. Widevine categorizes devices into three security levels, ranging from all processes running in the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) to not running anything in TEE at all. However, the Play Store listing seems tied to a device's SaftetyNet status (which is used by Android Pay), rather than the Widevine TEE. For example, Artem's bootloader-unlocked stock Pixel is still on Widevine Level 1, the most secure level, but fails SafetyNet because it is unlocked. The update's changelog also confirms the: "Version 5.0 only works with devices that are certified by Google and meet all Android requirements." What isn't exactly clear is why only the Play store listing is blocked, but the app itself continued to function normally. I tried both Netflix 4.16 and 5.0.4 (the latest version, from today), and both worked without problems on my unlocked and rooted Galaxy Tab S (which is labeled as Widevine Security Level 3). Maybe at some point the app will stop working, but that does not appear to be the case right now. If you have a blocked device, I recommend following the Pushbullet channel for Netflix on APKMirror (click the Pushbullet button on that page) so you can continue to receive updates outside the Play Store.

First the vpn's now this... why oh why??? Jimk4003 Surely because licensing is regionally specific, and because rooting has the potential to defeat DRM. I get that it might be annoying for some people, but aren't the reasons obvious? David Juarez But root?? Lol Semianonymous Probably an effort to reduce Region spoofing? Idk how easy that is to do on a stock device. Jimk4003 Because rooting has the potential to defeat DRM. mjh49783ab DRM doesn't work. All DRM does is inconvenience the end user. Jimk4003 Possibly. But Netflix have to negotiate licencing deals with the movie studios, and having DRM helps reassure the studios that the movies they have spent millions of dollars making aren't going to get stolen off Netflix without any attempt to stop it. mjh49783ab One could make the argument that rooting the phone may compromise the DRM. But blocking users from unlocking their phones to switch carriers? That is total bullshit, and is just the sort of thing that encourages users to pirate the content. Jimk4003 Netflix are blocking you from switching carriers? lomsha Sim unlocked phones are fine, unlocked bootloaders are blocked. mjh49783ab They didn't exactly make that clear in the article when I last read it. h4rr4r The studios need to reconsider blu rays then. Way easier to rip. Nothing they do will stop piracy. This kind of thing actually encourages it. Jimk4003 Maybe studios do need to consider Blu-ray's. That isn't Netflix's problem though. h4rr4r No Netflix problem is making sure they don't let the studios reduce the value of their product. If Amazon video works on my devices and Netflix does not that is a big deal to me. In that case I might as well sign up for more addon channels on Amazon with the mkney that currently goes to Netflix. Jimk4003 Agreed. But the studios are responsible for making the product they redistribute. It's certainly a balancing act, and I can see both sides of the argument, but Netflix isn't an inalienable right, and those who don't meet the T&C's are going to miss out. h4rr4r Sure, but the studios and Netflix are going to create pirates with these kind of actions. People aren't going to miss out. They will just pirate what they can't get legally. Jimk4003 Sure, but again, it's a tiny fraction of users. If Netflix can negotiate better terms with studios by blocking rooted devices, and thus improve their business overall at the expense of a few fringe users, it stands to reason that is what Netflix will do. Doby Gillis whaa fucking whaa. Sergio Carmona The only obvious thing here is your sarcasm detector not working properly. Go have it fixed please. Jimk4003 Nah, I'm good. h4rr4r So the reason are to make the product worse for the consumer. Great idea, now piracy looks better and better. Jimk4003 What percentage of phones are rooted though? Most people won't care, or even notice the change. h4rr4r It does not matter, if it drives even one person to piracy that is a loss. Jimk4003 But if they can ensure better licensing deals via these new terms, which will attract more customers at the expense of a few rooted users who make up a tiny fraction of overall users; will Netflix care about that loss? h4rr4r But if it encourages piracy the other side of the contract should want to avoid it. Gaining customers in the short term like this hurts the whole market in the long term. Cyber_Akuma Because yeah, people are going to rip movies from Netflix and not off a Blu-Ray.... and even IF they were to attempt to rip them off Netflix, they would use a PHONE and not a PC.... Jimk4003 Ripping Blu-rays isn't Netflix's problem, and Netflix don't need to try and guess what device someone would try and commit piracy with, when the technology exists to restrict them all. Cyber_Akuma You are missing the point, people aren't going to be ripping from Netflix over ripping from a Blu-Ray, and on top of that, they sure as hell aren't going to be ripping off a phone. And actually, you are wrong, the technology to "resist them all" does NOT actually exist. There is no one technology that "restricts them all" but several different technologies for different platforms with various levels of viability and success. Jimk4003 I said 'the technology exists'. When did I say it was a single piece of technology? Let's not be those guys who get in a pedantic argument about semantics on the internet. Regarding the issue under discussion; Netflix's job is to make their platform as robust as possible against piracy, using whatever technology is available to them. Blu-Ray simply isn't their problem. Cyber_Akuma Because just arguing "technology exists" is worthless, plenty of technology exists, and plenty of it is misused. Technically the technology to remotely brick your phone exists too, doesn't mean it's fine to use just because it "exists". And no, their platform already is robust, you are trying to ignore the fact that people ripping movies off a phone is a complete and total non-issue just to try to argue for Netflix's sake, this is ESPECIALLY considering the fact that it harms far more legitimate people than it helps. Sorry, but no, just a plain and completely undesputable NO. You can't argue that it's ok to use something that will hurt a large majority of people just to potentially possibly stop an extreme minority of people who would not even use this method anyway. That's like arguing it's ok to burn down a house to kill a spider. Jimk4003 "You can't argue that it's ok to use something that will hurt a large majority of people". We're talking about Netflix blocking rooted users; in what reality do they constitute the 'large majority' of Android users? Cyber_Akuma I meant the majority of the rooted users. Last time I checked, over 25% of people with an Android device had root access, which is several million users. And OF those several million rooted users, how many do you think actually use their rooted phone and Netflix app to pirate content? Less than 1% Hell, less than 0.1%? They are hurting over 99% of rooted Android users, which while not the majority of Android users is still a lot, to attempt to stop (and not even that effectively as there have been work-around for SafetyNet checks for nearly a year now) an extreme minority OF a minority from doing something they are unlikely to do due to other methods anyway. Richard Markert >I meant the majority of the rooted users. Even the majority of rooted users is a drop in the ocean when it comes to Android users worldwide. Cyber_Akuma Again, over 25%. You also completely missed the point of the argument in that this hurts nearly all rooted users that would not use this maliciously. Lord Argyris Looks like I'll have to start updating manually then. Or just not bother with the app at all since I rarely use Netflix on my phone as it is. SpasilliumNexus Thank goodness the 3T's Open Beta of OxygenOS is good enough for me to not unlock my device and stick with complete stock. Now I wonder why I haven't received any Netflix app updates beyond 4.16.1 build 15145 on the Play Store, when APKMirror has 4 newer versions. ast00 They asked for it. Now pirate their content knowing that you tried doing it the legal way, but THEY declined. Φώτης Because unlocking your Android powered device is such a "bad" thing to do. Whatever Netflix.

It's more convenient to steal the videos than to deal with the DRM restrictions. Fedup Exactly. Between VPN'ed torrents and nzbs, my Sonarr downloads all TV shows (netflix, HBO, ABC/CBS/NBC/FOX) automatically within minutes of them being ripped and posted by others. It is 100% automated, and with my Plex server running, I can watch shows anywhere - cost = $0.00. I don't do this to save money. I do it for the convenience, lack of ads, and freedom of time/place shifting. Heck, some shows actually download BEFORE they air on network TV (i.e. Designated Survivor). stan dex 97 new dark web premium links . also included are netfix lifetime membership links as well as graphic Live chat links (use anonymously) https://satoshibox.com/axbr7vnm6ifzk8hwtcreoe28/buy d0x360 I cancelled​ my account, sent them feedback and then just asked a friend who I let use HBO go and a Chromecast ultra if I could use their Netflix. David Gabel That seems rather dumb. Why cancel your service to them yet still use it via someone else? You're not teaching them anything. For an example, let's say you have a MacBook, and Apple does something to piss you off. You sell your MacBook, but then borrow a friend's MacBook. Nothing was actually accomplished. d0x360 Nothing was accomplished? I cancelled my account and let them know why. Now they aren't making money off me but I still to use their service. Your analogy is deeply flawed...deeply. So deeply I don't think you understand exactly what an analogy is. David Gabel So, you're "not giving them money" yet you still support them by using their product. It still seems like your logic is flawed. If you're really that pissed at Netflix, don't use it. Period. Use a different service instead of supporting them by borrowing it off a friend, as they are also giving them money (and support) , too via their subscription. revbones How is using their service for free "supporting" them? They aren't getting any revenue off you if you're not paying them. Saying you're supporting them by not paying them is a little stupid don't you think? xyz lol. So by your "logic" a person who pirates House of Cards is also supporting Netflix ? BobButtons You're doing the opposite of supporting. You're getting the benefits of their service while stopping payment and adding to server load which they pay for. David Gabel So far, your stance is the only one that makes sense. The rest so far are noise Sir Doogie Houser M.D.Esq. 200 You seen like an incredulous douch who I'd suplex onto a park bench for being a lap dog bitch.How is canceling or stealing not doing something.Also,its not a fucking macbook jerkoff its a paid service for TV on a phone they expect to be paid for.BTFO nagi Just another step that makes pirating the same content more convenient... we should really be going the other way if they ever want piracy to be reduced. lomsha Funny thing is their content is available to stream all over the internet. Don't see how this move fights piracy as long as computers have access. This just alienates legit users who are doing nothing nefarious on unlocked/rooted devices. Richard Branches By one everybody pays... Pathum Addarapathirana Dude I root my phone to just get iPhone emojis and to tether without my carrier knowing. Like I'm not stealing anything this will just make me stop paying for Netflix. Latheryin Just a heads up. Those treating hiding mods are fake. There is no way to hide if from the carrier. Heck if they wanted to they could see every web page you load from a ton of different places and ways. Yan Minari That’s why god invented VPN Latheryin Yes but even then it doesn't block everything. qqqqqq My provider absolutely blocks tethering - I've been using various methods, including VPNs, to block it for literally YEARS... Hasn't been difficult. Dylan Harris That's not true. All you have to due to bypass tethering limits on t-mobile is to change the TTL on the tethered device. Latheryin That just gets by the automated checks. Get a live person to randomly pick your account (not really likely but happens) and it is not had to tell if someone is tethering. Dmitri Smirnov All that person will be able to tell is whether customer is using a lot of data or not. And this is the root of the problem: be honest that you are limited traffic, instead of trying to play this game of "we'll pretent we are giving you unlimited data and in return you'll only use small-format mobile device, so that we'll hope that you won't be able to use as much of it". Kind of "all you can eat, but you have to only use a tea cup and one chopstick". Latheryin No the issue is people being entitled and taking advantage of things. You have people running their gaming systems and using hundreds of gb a month. Not only is that kinda dumb but it violate the fair use act in most cell TOS. If people didn't abuse the system then it wouldn't be an issue. Also just some food for thought. If they can't tell anything more then a lot of data just how do they route the traffic properly? Make no mistake. If the carrier wanted to they could tell. I know for a fact that there is a team for both att and Verizon that is tasked with just that. Dmitri Smirnov >No the issue is people being entitled and taking advantage of things. You have people running their gaming systems and using hundreds of gb a month. "taking advantage" I thought that people were in their right by using what they paid for. Allright, tell me this - is it allright for me to watch 4K video on my phone (since the screens allow it now)? What's the difference between this and me watching the same stream on my laptop over my phone's connection? What if I just redirect the video stream to my TV using WiDi or any other technology? How is browsing a site from a laptop different from browsing it from a phone network-congestion-wise? And then it boils down to the same argument - carriers are just hoping you'll use the network less from you phone device, as it's less convenient. The more convenient smartphones become for consuming large volumes of traffic, the sooner carriers will have to more away from this scan and expose the actual numbers. > If people didn't abuse the system then it wouldn't be an issue. If carriers would be honest and upfront about "hidden" caps, then people would not be able to game the system. > Also just some food for thought. If they can't tell anything more then a lot of data just how do they route the traffic properly? Make no mistake. If the carrier wanted to they could tell. Latheryin Tethering was never even an extra charge until people started taking advantage of the mobile networks. Watching 4k videos is not a big deal, using 200gb of mobile data in a cycle is flat out stupid. Mobile networks were not designed for that type of traffic from a single device. Nor was it made to handle running your ps4 while you are gaming. Why do you think that pages are made to be mobile friendly? Not only is it a usability issue but a data usage issue as well. It's not hidden. All people have to do is read the TOS. It's all right there. Yet most people just don't want to take the time to do it and then get made about it. Can't blame the carriers for that. Dmitri Smirnov > Watching 4k videos is not a big deal, using 200gb of mobile data in a cycle is flat out stupid. a) I'm glad we're finally on the same page that the real problem for networks is data usage and not tethering or no tethering. b) You are aware that you're contradicting yourself in the same sensense? 4K 60Fps video bitrate is ~20-40 MiB/s which gives an average movie the size of about 72GiB. so by your definition watching a movie in good quality is OK as long as you don't watch more than 3 of them in a month. c) how is using mobile data that you paid for - stupid? If there are caps - announce them and make it impossible to go over them instead of shaming people who actually decide to take you up on your offer. d) tethering has not been an extra charge until telcos understood that they could charge extra for it (just like them toying with idea of charging extra for Instant Messenger traffic, because it undercuts their SMS plans). > It's not hidden. All people have to do is read the TOS. It's all right there. Yet most people just don't want to take the time to do it and then get made about it. Can't blame the carriers for that. Well, carriers are the ones calling their plans "unlimited" and hiding the actual caps either buried deep in the ToS or behind the vague "reasonable usage". So don't blame people for not wanting to wade through pages of legalspeak just to learn that you lied and "unlmited" is just "50Gb and then throttled". Fedup Agreed. The problem is the AMOUNT of data consumed by a given user account - no how it is consumed. If carriers are concerned about individuals abusing their network, then they need to flag those accounts that use an excessive amount of bandwidth - whether it's through tethering or directly on the device itself. I could easily burn through 150GB/mo on my TMO Note 4 w/o tethering simply by leaving my Blue Iris app connected and streaming 24/7. So it's actually very easy to abuse the system without ever turning on the tethering. Android Developer Is the tether solution needed even if you do it using USB ? Fulbring What a stupid move. I pay for the premium for Netflix and I never thought that I might have to cancel my service just because they did this. The only reason why I have root is because of AdAway and TitaniumBackup. I still use the stock OnePlus 3T ROM. Wasn't expecting this at all.... Kinda suck. Will be interesting to see how many customers they lose. Julian Berger Not enough to change it back... 4Ui812 DRM has no place in our lives. I suspect Netflix will have a change of heart within 6 months. Branko Xiaomi phones say bye bye to Netflix. Google go fuck yourselves. Steve_Jobroni Go fucking buy a windows phone. 天地人 Seriously though Windows phones are great. The only problem with them is the lack of applications. Otherwise, it runs great on low-end hardware, has a great UI, the homescreen is innovative, synchronisation with Windows PCs is cool, etc. dukaki Don't forget that you can use the Netflix website on Edge instead of their shitty app, and it streams at full 1080p, even on my L650 with a 720p screen. 天地人 Wait the Netflix application hasn't an option to stream at FHD? dukaki Nope, just 480p like on android. The device has to be "certified" and there are no certified windows phones afaik. The WP app doesn't even have downloads yet, I think. Edit: Just checked, no option to download here but you can on the desktop app. EowynCarter Might end with a visit at the apple store in my case. Windows phone is kind of not supported anymore. Jimk4003 This is Netflix, not Google. Cyber_Akuma Google invented this SafetyNet crap, let anyone use it for any reason (Hell, Pokemon GO of all things started using it), and over the last year have been making it even more and more strict and unforgiving. So no, a HUGE part of the blame does lie on Google for being openly hostile towards rooted users and not giving a damn about them. Jimk4003 There are legitimate reasons to use Safetynet to check the integrity of a device: Android Pay (or banking apps in general) is one example. It isn't necessarily hostility to root users; it's just a reality that Google need to be able to demonstrate to banks or other third parties that their OS is secure, and that people can't bypass built in security safeguards. Netflix need to do the same with the studios they redistribute content for; and they've chosen to use Safetynet to do it. Netflix isn't a human right; you have no inalienable right to root your phone and to use Netflix. Cyber_Akuma Except that not even my own banking app uses SafetyNet, it still has root checking and certain sensitive features are disabled if I am rooted, but not the entire app. Furthermore, it IS hostility to rooted users, because anyone can toss SafetyNet into their app for any reason whatsoever (such as games using it "just because" in case of cheaters... which doesn't even help at all to stop them). Google has been completely unwilling to work out ANY sort of compromise or method that can keep a phone secure without basically tossing rooted users under the bus. Jimk4003 What sort of compromise do you envision? Cyber_Akuma I am saying that they didn't even try. PCs by default obviously allow admin accounts all the time, even as the main user account (as much as that is not recommended) yet can maintain security. Google when they were confronted with people who were hurt by SafetyNet, legitimate users mind you, basically just shrugged them off and didn't even bother considering what could be done to allow the device to remain secure while also having such safeties in place. I mean, all these apps that you can use on your phone, can also be used on a PC, many of them available in either a browser or native app format, yet it remains secure. There is no reason this could not be done with Android, especially considering it used Linux as a base, they are just refusing to even consider it. Jimk4003 Don't you already have that choice? Your phone is sold without root access (i.e. no admin rights), and you can then choose whether or not to root your device and gain elevated privileges. If you do choose to root your device, you will lose access to some Safetynet enabled applications. You can, of course, unroot if necessary. Cyber_Akuma First of all, not all phones are. Especially in non-US countries. Second, it shouldn't have to be a choice. How many PC apps refuse to run under an admin account? Practically none. I shouldn't have to choose between having root access or being able to use a apps that more and more are starting to add this nonsense to them. Third, it's not even just root, even having an unlocked BOOTLOADER now, even if your rom is 100% stock and unrooted, can trip SafetyNet, it didn't used to be that strict. It's ridiculous to claim one should be able to have one or the other, even SafetyNet could have been designed to not be this brokenly strict, but Google had no interest in doing so, and they are rapidly making having root more and more useless while we still have to deal with all the junk they force on your phone from the manufacturer... that you can only remove with root. Jimk4003 Well, it is what it is. You believe you shouldn't have to make a choice, whereas I believe life is all about making choices and living with the outcomes. We seldom get everything we want, and neither Netflix, nor rooting, are inalienable rights. Whether or not you think it should be a choice, it is one; choose what you feel is best for you. Cyber_Akuma That's not even an argument, that's just trying to claim that the status quo should remain for no reason other than it is the status quo. It shouldn't have to be a choice, and arguing that people have to choose between root and having an increasingly less amount of apps just because "it is what it is" is insanity. In fact, it wasn't even the status quo before until Google started pulling this nonsense with SafetyNet a short while ago. That doesn't mean people should just accept it. Jimk4003 It's not an argument, because there is no argument to be had. The reality of the situation is self-evident; you can't have a rooted device and install Netflix via Google Play. Accepting the status quo has nothing to do with it; it's simply acknowledging reality. You have to choose what's more important to you; Netflix or rooting your phone. Finding the reality frustrating, as you clearly do, won't make it any less real. If this was a serious discussion on human rights; censorship, migration, justice, gender equality etc., then it's important in a democracy to be aware of your rights and responsibilities, and challenge the status quo where necessary. But this isn't anything like that. This is two for-profit corporations, Google and Netflix, who provide services to which you have no fundamental right to access, nor any obligation to use. You can choose to pay for their services and accept their terms and conditions, or you can choose not to. You don't get to pick the terms and conditions of the service someone else is providing you; however you are free to not use the service if you don't like the terms and conditions under which they are provided. That's it; it's no simpler or more complicated than that. Ranting on the internet about how unfair you perceive it to be is irrelevant. Again, it is what it is. Cyber_Akuma Again, there is no "it is what it is" argument. There should be no choice, PERIOD. You are basically saying that people should not complain about this just because "it is what it is". No, it is NOT what it is, it should NOT BE what it is, and people can and WILL complain that it SHOULD NOT be what it is. You aren't even making any rational arguments anymore, just re-stating what the current situation is and then basically claiming that people should not want or expect better. Jimk4003 You can want or expect better if you like. Netflix, like every other for-profit enterprise in a capitalist system, will either succeed or fail based on its ability to turn a profit. Right now, Netflix is turning a profit, and clearly thinks it can be more profitable by excluding rooted users whose theoretical ability to circumvent DRM restrictions may impact its ability to secure rights to new content. Clearly you disagree with their stance, and the only way to see for sure if your disagreement is warranted is to watch their financial performance from here on out. None of the above changes the fact that you aren't entitled to Netflix. You've chosen to root your phone, and Netflix have recently chosen to exclude rooted users. That leaves you with a choice to make. Even if you think that choice is unfair, even if you think you should be able to have both. The reality is you can't have both, and you will have to choose. Again, Netflix isn't a right. Go elsewhere if you disagree with their business practices; that's how capitalism works. Beyond that, you're just having a spat with reality; and that's a tough fight to win ;) Cyber_Akuma Actually, what do you think would lose them more profits, the theoretical minority OF a minority that MIGHT rip movies on their phones (which still requires a Netflix account in the first place) or blocking that 25% minority? Also, drop this "right" nonsense. No, seriously, drop it right now. People are paying for a Netflix account, they DO have a right to get the service they paid for. Netflix made zero warning or mention of this impending block, they pulled it out of nowhere for paying customers. So sorry, but they DO have a right to the service, since they are paying for it. Sony was found to be legally in the wrong when they removed the OtherOS feature from the PS3, because why? Because people PAID for the console when it had that feature, they DID have a right to what they paid for. You're just having a spat with arguing for argument's sake when you don't even have an argument. Jimk4003 There is no argument; it's the reality of the situation. Netflix have implemented DRM controls that block access to the Netflix app via the Play Store on rooted devices. I do understand why Netflix want to tighten their DRM procedures, and I do understand why some people have been left frustrated by this change. The reality is, however, if you want to download the Netflix app via Google Play, you will need an un-rooted phone; such as the phones used by the majority of Android users. That's all that's happening. I get that you don't like it. But stamping your foot and shouting 'no fair, no fair' achieves nothing. Netflix are entitled to run their business how they see fit within the law; and consumers get to choose whether they want to give Netflix their business or not. That's all there is to it. Don't like the way Netflix do business; don't give Netflix your money. Cyber_Akuma All you are doing with the "it is what it is" argument is just repeating what the article is saying. That is not conductive to anything. Anyone who has read the article knows what is happening right now. And sorry, but you are doing the same stamping your foot with the "well, it is what it is" argument. Not to mention that you are also wrong, because over the last 5 or so years ALONE there have been dozens of examples of consumers speaking out against policies or DRM and the companies begin forced to reverse it from the backlash. So you are doing nothing but hurting legitimate users by trying to argue "it is what it is". And again, no, they are not entitled to run their business in a way that without warning locks customers out of what they paid for, Sony tried this... and got in legal trouble and lost. So sorry, but you are wrong, and you have been nothing but wrong this entire argument. Netflix isn't' "entitled" to do this, people DO have a reason to complain, there IS a reason to complain, complaining HAS changed such practices before, and all you are doing is further hurting legitimate users by attempting to insist the "it is what it is" non-argument. Your entire argument has been fundamentally wrong from the start. Jimk4003 It's not my argument; it's simply Netflix's position. I get you don't agree with it, but it's totally valid for Netflix to wish to strengthen their DRM procedures. You do know I'm not responsible for Netflix's decision making, right? It is what it is; I wouldn't get too upset about it. Cyber_Akuma Again, "it is what it is" is not a valid argument. Jimk4003 No it's not an argument. Again, there is no argument necessary; the reality of the situation is self-evident, and no amount of arguing here will change it. The fact is this; YOU rooted your phone. You weren't forced. You should have known that by rooting your phone you are modifying the device beyond its factory specification. You should have known that this essentially makes you responsible for the proper operation of the device; you no longer have the device manufacturer or Google to turn to when software that you have modified doesn't work as expected. You should also have known that rooting prevents a device from complying with the compatibility test suite, and that this can affect your devices ability to function correctly. You should have been aware of the SafetyNet API, and anticipated the fact that this API would be adopted more and more broadly as Google promoted its usage. You can't blame Google for this; as before, once you modify your device beyond its factory spec, you're responsible for supporting yourself. Rooting a device is at the owners risk. You've now found yourself in a situation where a modification you have made to your device prevents you from accessing a service you want to use. That's on you; no-one made you modify your device, no-one said they would take responsibility for the changes you have made to your device, and rooted users are expected to assume liability for any ramifications and complications they face as a result of their decision to modifying their device. Netflix are well within their rights to enforce DRM on their product by using the SafetyNet API provided by Google, and the Google documentation clearly states rooted devices will fail the CTS check. This documentation is publicly available. You went ahead and rooted your device anyway. That's on you. It's no-one elses job to make sense of the decisions you have taken. You're free to carry on using Netflix if you return your device to a state where the integrity of the device can be verified. Or you're free to carry on using a rooted device and living with the compromises that entails. Your choice. Cyber_Akuma I don't think you get it. All you are doing is parroting what the article is saying. Furthermore, despite there being plenty of examples of complaining doing EXACTLY what you claim it cannot do, that is to change such decisions, you keep repeating that "complaining will do nothing". You are a broken record, arguing the same "it is what it is" argument over and over so you can avoid actually thinking. An argument (and yes, no matter how much YOU stomp your feet that it is not, it IS an argument) that has already been disproven over and over and over. You also ignored that there are many countries where phones are already sold rooted, or how such things don't effect using such services on a PC with admin rights which are the same thing, or the dozens of other holes in your logic large enough to sail a ship through. There is no "you should have been aware" because this is a total lapse in common sense and my device is in no way incompatible from a hardware or software level, but rather, the app is purposely rejecting it. Furthermore, they made no prior warning whatsoever. This is like arguing "you should have known modern cars could be remotely disabled" if a dealership decides to just disable all cars with an aftermarket radio installed. I don't know where to even begin with all the broken wrong logic in that last post. Why are you even here if you couldn't care less? You are free to carry on being a living example of "First they came", but don't come crying about how nobody else is listening to you because you could not possibly be any more wrong. I DO have a right to use Netflix on my device, rooted or no, if I am paying for it. If you argue against this, you are wrong. People DO have a right to root their devices, if you argue against this, you are wrong. People DO have a right (and have many many MANY times in the past) to challenge the "it is what it is" status quo, if you argue against this, you are wrong. And I know you WILL argue against this, which will mean that, see above, you are wrong. I have been more than patient with your insane thick-headnedness. At this point I can't tell if you are being willfully ignorant or really are just that ignorant. Or just trolling, that is an option as well. There is no way anyone rational at this point can continue to argue the insanity that you have argued. Jimk4003 I interpret personal insults as an indicator that the individual making them no longer has any faith in their actual arguments, and so I think it's time to call time on this particular discussion. As you've pointed out, neither of us is getting anywhere. It's been fun, but once it starts getting abusive, the fun has to stop. It's a shame, because DRM Vs individual user rights has the potential to be a really interesting discussion topic. I hope you get what you're after; and that the reality of the situation will change to be more in line with what you think it should be. Unfortunately I imagine the situation regarding DRM and rooted devices will only get more restrictive going forward. Take care. Cyber_Akuma You purposely instigate people into losing their patience with you, and then claim "I win because you got angry", especially when the anger is because you were refusing to understand the entire argument throughout this entire mess. Richard Markert Root is, by definition, unsecure. Any time you have userland processes that have access to ring0 you are inherently unsecure, as there are no restrictions placed upon running code at that point. Cyber_Akuma And yet, there are ways to run it securely on PCs. Netflix and online banking would not be available on PCs if it wasn't. TedPhillips mostly agree. by providing a turn-key 'lockdown' check, and further by ret-conning it into playstore access (let's see how far they take that) -google is now openly hostile to anyone who bought into android for it's ability to customize and truly 'own' your own device. the open source roots of android was a big differentiator vs something like iOS, but now that they have dominate market position - they are walking away from that without concern. (only worrying about how slow they need to boil the frog to get away with it) meanwhile, what middle manager is going to say 'no' to adding safetyNet checks in their app or play store listing? it is an easy way for them to write down on potential risks, unjustified (which it pretty much always is) or not. blindexecutioner So the solution is to install from outside the play store. That's great for security. Way to go. Richard Markert No they don't. Since Windows 7, new and default users are not Admin accounts. koiulpoi Sorry, this is absolutely wrong. The first user created on a Windows PC has full administrative access, limited by UAC. You can still delete System32, it's just mildly harder than it used to be. If "new and default users" were not Admin accounts, they couldn't install software, so... Richard Markert Default user accounts are higher than Limited accounts, but not as high as Admin accounts. That's why they can install software. Linux users are not admins but can still install software, right? It started on Windows 7, expanded in 8/8.1 and now in Windows 10 a user account behaves just like a user account in Linux. It has no access to %systemdir% unless you manually go in the folder properties and give your user account Admin permissions to it. You can still run things AS admin by giving the permission at runtime, but since all that requires is pressing a button (if your built-in admin account isn't passworded, which it isn't by default, one step forward two back, sigh) and most users are too "stupid" to simply not press that button. koiulpoi It's really funny when people speak authoritatively about something they're so wrong about. The first account created by the Windows OOBE is automatically added to the Administrators group. This means they're an Administrator. They have Administrative privileges. The fact that certain actions are blocked until you click "yes" on a simple UAC prompt doesn't stop this; they're in "Admin Approval Mode", which can be disabled via GPO if you care to. If you buy a computer from Dell (example), set it up, then go to System32 and start deleting .dll files, it'll ask for administrative privileges, but you can click yes and away it goes! Some files are protected at "SYSTEM" level, which is higher than administrator, but DEFAULT USERS ARE ADMINISTRATORS. This has ABSOLUTELY nothing to do with the "password" on the built-in "Administrator" account. That account is disabled out-of-the-box. Please, you're digging a bigger hole trying to look "right". How to prove this: Set up a new computer. Set up user default for MS. Start -> Run -> netplwiz -> Be amazed that your user is part of the group "Administrators". TechGuy22 Haha kodi Doesn't matter to me I Stopped paying for Netflix long time ago. C64 Haha Teranium TV 😎 TechGuy22 I like that too. You can even get the mod one and remove the ads. Lol C64 I know, i always use those. I want to pay for the dev, but there's no option to do that. Koko time is coming with a big update to tim242 Thief. Renato Santos This is stupid. Congratulations, Netflix. Jan-Lk Else It is also getting more and more necessary to unlock / root devices due to missing updates etc. But I'm not a Netflix customer and won't become one. C64 Whahaha, this has to be the most retarded move of the year in any category (even Trump can't top this). I'm glad i don't use Old Crap Flix. A Person Hillary, then Netflix. C64 Nope sorry. Since Trump is your president i can't take America serious anymore A Person Timeout, you're not even a US citizen? No interest in your opinion. James F Wow. Just wow. I can't take you seriously either if that's how you treat people. Not cool, man. A Person "Wow, just wow"? When he can vote in our elections I'll take his opinions of our elections seriously. It is highly ill-informed anyhow. Paul Sterling A person wins! Marcelove Timeout, you are a Trump supporter? No interest in your opinion (neither anyone smart in the world). Roy Riddex Just so I'm clear on this, by unlocked are we talking about SIM unlocked? lomsha No no, unlocked bootloader. Roy Riddex Thanks Corbin Davenport Unlocked bootloader. pbergonzi I wonder how long they'll stick with that premise seeing as how much public opinion expressed here is against them. Screw them. Get the APK somewhere else or install magisk and hide your root. Too many people root their devices and have a good reason for doing so and Netflix should not penalize them. Doby Gillis Dude, normal people don't give a fuck about rooted phones. It's just the elitist twats who do it anymore. twiz0r Dude, you're an elitist twat. Richard Markert Most people who root seem to be. The sentiment among rooters is "if you don't root your phone, you're not as good as me and don't deserve to have a phone. Root you stupid noob!" twiz0r thanks for confirming your twatness. good day. C64 One word ..... Bullshit Corey Kinard I've yet to see that... Maybe you just feel like that because they do in fact know more than you? Richard Markert My first version of Android was 1.5. I've seen it for many years. How long have you been in the scene? EowynCarter My phone isn't rooted. And not compatible anymore ! Franco Fassio Unlocked bootloader maybe? EowynCarter Yes. But seam I can't lock it without wipe. So screw you Netflix. Marcelove Let me guess, your profile pic is that right? https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/0f0c4f3e3ce40074aebfe58d80511d4a0b7d4a94896ce54d82e448a1cd2e3ceb.jpg bruce lancaster Dude. It isn't just rooted phones - Also unlocked. Elitists get their iphones and galaxy s8s from att and verizon. Normal people get their devices from amazon, ebay, newegg, gearbest etc. Jimk4003 I'm sure Netflix are terrified that the tiny fraction of Android users who come to this site, and the similarly tiny fraction who root their phones, are bothered. The rest of the world won't care. bruce lancaster An article in Wireless Week (cellphone industry rag) a couple of months back says it's now a majority of phones in Asia that are unlocked and Europe is getting pretty close to 50/50. US passed 30% unlocked around Christmas. People aren't getting their phones from ATT, Verizon, etc any more now that they have to pay full retail and don't get a free or heavily discounted flagship device with contract renewal. They are getting them from Amazon, Gearbest, Newegg, etc and moving their sim. If I owned stock in Netflix right now, I'd sell it quick on this news. Everything that isn't already mobile is going mobile. Alienating half the European market and 30% of the US market is asinine. Fedup Yup. Ditched my flagship Samsung phone for a 'budget' Moto G5 Plus that is 100% compatible with all four US carriers (and their dozens of MNVOs). Swapping providers is as easy as changing the sim. And despite the slower spec'ed hardware, the carrier bloat-free Nougat is WAY faster than my TW Galaxy phone - and the battery life is INSANE. C64 Probably 90 % of the people don't know what root is. Almost every person I know owns an Android device, but i'm the only geek who flashes and roots his devices bruce lancaster It isn't just rooted phones but also unlocked phones. Got your phone on amazon? Got it on ebay? Got it from gearbest? Got it from newegg? Yup. No netflix for you without jumping through enough hoops that you'll actually know about rooting by the time you get it done. Fedup Are we conflating a carrier-unlocked vs. bootloader unlocked phone? They are two distinctly different things, and I doubt that having a carrier-unlocked phone (i.e. using a TMO phone on ATT, or VZ on Sprint) has any impact on SafetyNet or Widevine. pbergonzi Judging from the posts here it looks like nobody who roots their phone uses Netflix anyway so I guess it's moot. But the outcry sure did get them a bunch of free publicity. T4rd This is what Magisk is for. Pretty sure if I can still use Android Pay with my rooted 6P, I can still use/update Netflix through the Play Store. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Magisk still requires that you unlock your bootloader, which is enough to trigger safety net these days, so that won't work. TechGuy22 You don't know how magisk works do you Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ I understand that Magisk is a great tool for modifying my system without actually modifying it. I understand that there are many modules that allow you to do things like hide root, bypass security modules, skin your system, and plenty of other things. What I don't understand is how you can install magisk without unlocking your bootloader. Back when I originally tried it out with pokemon go, it worked well for a while, but eventually even just having my bootloader unlocked was all it took to throw SafetyNet. If that's not an issue anymore, then great! But maybe say that instead of being snarky. Thomas Gladdines Bootloader can be simply locked after rooting and installing a custom recovery. Edwin O. Lol no You could, but then you can't flash anything with said recovery... So no point Thomas Gladdines LOL the recovery doesn't stop working after a bootloader is locked, only fastboot won't flash images but the recovery can do whatever it wants to, update the rom, edit system files etc. Muzzy996 Well as an example for the Google Pixel: https://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=71901761&postcount=454 In this case all it takes is a kernel that supports Magisk and hides the fact that the bootloader is unlocked, at which point with Magisk Hide enabled all root and SafetyNet checks pass. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Excellent. I'll have to look back into this then, last time I used magisk it wasn't as capable, glad to see it's come this far. sbeaulieu Magical Hide is there for that Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Can Magical Hide hide that my bootloader is unlocked? Serious question, not being sarcastic or snarky as I was below. sbeaulieu It does make the SafetyNet check pass iJeggu Magisk itself doesn't hide an unlocked bootloader it only hides root but must custom roms simply delete the verifiedbootstate -flag which in turn makes safetynet pass even with an unlocked bootloader. Some older devices don't have this flag in their kernels in the first place so safetynet will accept that the flag is missing. Link to the patch that most custom roms (kernels to be specific) have to pass safetynet: https://github.com/sultanxda/android_kernel_oneplus_msm8996/commit/abc05b16bbd33521c2fffaf491c5657a94bfcfc5 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/5b1ff3f47e32d5f57ddadcd650a5b94725bd4e6242cea92e269f51e988d0d426.png T4rd Except it's working for me right now... jonzey231 This has been happening for a week now. I tweeted it to Ruddock a few days ago. Just didn't put together that it was because I was unlocked. https://twitter.com/jonzey231/status/862122438125072384 steelew Google really needs to start stealing from the root community the way apple takes from the jailbreak community. It feels like rooting is way down except for a few (legal) use cases. If it weren't for visual tweaks & usability tweaks, I would have no need to root (personally). This kind of stuff starts to make rooting unpleasant. I already can't use fingerprint auth in my banking app any more because root. Jesús Cuenca They do. I used rooms for like 8 years maybe? And a lot of the "new features" always come of the rom or root comunity. Right now i use roms, but not root. Marcelove I'm trying to stay indoors, but is complicate... Greenify for example, works at no root devices nowadays... But is way better with root and Xposed... Doze can't compare against Greenify... Maybe at version number 20 root wouldn't be necessary... Sandeep Raghuraman What about the version downloaded from Amazon app store though? Does that work fine? TwoBit Gary It worked, but it is old version without show downloads. Go to apkmirror oculairmedia Interesting move. I flashed a custom ROM on my Nexus 6 because stock was so slow that it was getting unusable, but screw me right ? Atoqir In my country lots of stuff doesn't work on unrooted devices. My bank app, payment app and local cable TV and digicorder app all stopped working. Also s-health doesn't work anymore and soon Netflix. Time to unroot Marcelove "Time to unroot" Sheep. Richard Markert Rooting is insecure. You don't need to access the system partition except to break things. Benjamin Walburn If that were the case then this wouldn't be an issue. Nobody is looking to break their phone. Richard Markert Few people I've talked to online know what they're doing when it comes to root. Most of those end up breaking things. Rooting is far too easy and probably shouldn't exist at all. Benjamin Walburn You could say the same about anything, not just modification of phones. Maybe you shouldn't own a car if you can't fix it yourself, or have kids if you aren't a doctor. Rooting isn't easy, it's made easy by the hard work of other people. It's not up to you what other people do with their property, you have no right to say that they shouldn't. And if someone breaks their phone, what does it have to do with you? It's their hobby and their phone. You're not their daddy. senoredusty Or use Magisk DJMix No need. You could use magisk su hide for the moment. it still passes the safetynet. I too use a banking app that cannot be used on normal root proocess faceless128 "please stop giving us money and use Kodi instead" Sounds like a great business plan! JD For the sake of Kodi's developers don't say Kodi in that context. ericshmerick Hrmm, every time I hear Kodi, I think of pirated content. Guess when people are like "I use Kodi for my 30TB media collection" I stop and wonder how... Yes, ripping a lifetime of DVDs, but nah. Probably piracy. C64 I know a few how really use it legally Powsniffer0110 Yea I use it legally 95% of the time. ErectBipedal nah man, I use Kodi to browse my 30TB of linux isos. Totally legit I swear. Chazz Matthews Torrents are legal too. Just depends on the content. Mike Honestly though, if pirate add-ons wern't available on kodi, 98% of the people using it now would not have even heard of it before. Even bad publicity is good publicity. They are not going to publicly come out and say it, but the add-on's are the only reason they're well known. Andy Roid But kodi makes piracy so easy! Blian Oh god, please stop. Nobody is using Kodi for their DVD rips. Railwayman I rather say Fusion and Exodus et al instead since Kodi is... Kodi and you have to install what you want. The Netflix business plan is for her more people on Exodus, Phoenix and SALTS - not to mention Terrarium TV and MovieBox as well. Kevin Strident Kodi is open source. If Kodi stops wanting to be as useful as it is now, someone will fork it and keep it doing what its users enjoy. cbstryker Kodi is just an open source media player. To watch any pirated content you either need to download it or install an unaffiliated plugin that streams from pirated sources. C64 Next kodi wil have drm build in. So people have to use forks. I stopped using kodi since i found Teranium TV. cbstryker That makes zero sense. Kodi's reason for existing would stop. C64 That's BS my friend, Kodi (xbmc) has started on the original xbox and was made and used as a media player Justin D Same...but with Plex and something else >.> Dany Lol I know right? I was using Kodi more than Netflix anyway so... Dmitry Stepanushkin Xposed + RootCloak or something similar will do it for most of apps for those who need root. So I think not a big problem. Abhishek Saral Not a big problem but a big annoyance. tehboogieman Hmm, rootcloak isn't working for me with netflix m477 No, it won't work. Safetynet always fails if you have closed activated, or if you just have an unlocked bootloader. Sometimes even by just having adb debugging turned on. Kan☆n MagiskSU and its manager app comes with a very good hider built-in. No Xposed needed. h4rr4r Beyond pointless. Netflix won by being easier than piracy, this threatens to turn back the clock on that. Lexster These companies don't seem to get that most people pirate because it's easier/cheaper than buying what they want. Yes, it's wrong, whatever, the point is streaming services made it easier for people, which outweighed the hassle of pirating it. You're right, this kind of thing is what will get people to start doing it again more. BobButtons If I can't use Netflix on my rooted phone, it's Netflix that'll go, not the root. They're encouraging piracy. YaKillaCJ Exactly. Screw it, I only have Netflix for convenience. This will also have negative impact on many devices and average consumers even if they never unlock or root. A lot don't have Google certification, such as upcoming OEMs. Then theirs beta roms like Xiaomi and OnePlus that run awesome. Marcelove Funny thing: I was about to become a subscriber of Netflix after seeing House of Cards by PirateBay but now through the official channel because I thought that Netflix deserved my money... Look : deservED... But this movie will keep me at PirateBay... Funny thing 2: I have a Moto G5 that I could unlock and root and I didn't it just because I wanna see how things are nowadays without root... And I use a lot of apps that would work better with root (Greenify for example)... So I would be able to use Netflix... And I won't and will stay that way only because this douchebag move... Congratulations Netflix... Funny thing 3: So happy that I waited till House of Cards release to become a subscriber... Netflix should learn something from Frank Underwood... And from Blockbuster... tim242 Yeah, sure you were. Once a thief, always a thief. koiulpoi This is the most untrue statement I've read on this website. Thomas Elephants can fly 天地人 http://gadling.com/2012/06/10/airline-transports-herd-of-african-elephants-photos/ koiulpoi Nice! You matched it. 天地人 Yes, because illegally pirating from huge corperations which constantly attempt to and successfully brainwash people into agenda using various tricks, is somehow bad? You're not supporting the creators of the show, sure. But you're also not supporting the 6 Jewish companies that control 90% of American media. Anyways, with your little money you wouldn't be benefitting anybody. Do you honestly think those Jewish companies are dying to get a hold of your $120 you payed for Netflix this year? Probably not. The creators of the show, are well off anyways. Don't companies pay them to have their content on their platform and pay for their production cost and wages? Then; they've already been payed. I'm not endorsing piracy. It isn't the best thing to do, but I think calling people a "thief" and grouping them with people who have actually stolen things off individuals which mean a lot to the individual and murdered some individuals in the process, is just stupid. It's not the same as 'stealing' bits of 1s and 0s. Again, I'm not endorsing piracy, however there are a lot of good reasons to pirate movies and TV shows. Paul Sterling You're a thief. People leave their families for months to give you works of art. Games, movies, music. You can't throw them a few bucks? I'm legit, always will be. Also, tax helps everyone. Your wall of text is just trying to convince yourself, thief. 天地人 Nope. A thief is different from a pirate, besides, they've already been payed. And I was talking about TV shows and movies, but you're too dense to realise it. jj14x Not the same. If I spend time writing code for software, and decide to sell a monthly license instead of a perpetual license, that is my choice. Your choice should be to either subscribe to the monthly license, or to find a competitor software to use instead. Choosing to bypass the licensing checks makes you a thief (taking something without the owner's permission makes you a thief). And same logic applies to TV shows/movies. If you want to own the movie and watch it whenever you want it, BUY it. "illegally pirating from huge corperations which constantly attempt to and successfully brainwash people into agenda using various tricks, is somehow bad?"<-- YES - it is still illegal. Just because somebody stole your car doesn't mean you can go and steal that person's car in retaliation. There are laws and procedures on how to handle that. STDog Illegal != bad, legal != good. Thousands of unjust laws have been passed. They made actions illegal that were not bad. Richard Markert It's trickle-down, man. Think about if everybody thought like you. Netflix has 100 million subs and each pay at the minimum $107/yr and that's 10.7 billion. Now if that 10.7 billion were wiped out in an instant, how is Netflix going to make new shows or seasons of existing shows? It's the same with the rest of the content creation business. You and me, we're just a drop in the bucket when it comes to their revenue, but instead of scooping it out a spoonful at a time while adding water by the cup, somebody dumped the bucket over, there would be no money left to pay the content creators before content is even made. Railwayman I guess you like DRM and proprietary vendor lock in? The only moral of the story is: Pay for legit services then and watch posted content - the creators get paid and you get proper content without restrictions. The day the industry realize that DRM, geo blocking and so forth are counter productive will be historic. Fedup Love my Moto G5 Plus. Best phone I've had so far - and that's coming from a number of Samsung flagship phones. It's so much snappier and the battery life is insane. I waited a full 48 hours before caving and unlocking/rooting. Haven't looked back. I hate ads, and w/o root, you can't miracast to anything other than chromecast. Trysta Noticed this a little while ago. The crazy thing is I'm not even rooted or interested in any mods. I needed to sideload the latest version 7.1.2 because my RMA Nexus 6p refused to update on its own. I'm keeping the bootloader unlocked so I can recover if my phone boot loops. I rarely use Netflix on my phone but this is kind of annoying. I suspect this has something to do with offline movie watching (which is amazing). jj14x You don't need to unlock bootloader to sideload the full OTA images that Google publishes on their website. Tim Harman But you do need it to recover in your phone bootloops, as he said. jj14x True, but by that logic, everyone should keep their phone's bootloader unlocked all the time (because a bootloop, in theory, could happen to anyone/anytime) - not just when flashing a factory image. EowynCarter You don't ? Had to when installing a developper preview. Then I left it that way, so I won't be locked out in case of boot loop. TedPhillips or when you have some random block on disk get corrupted, ala nexus 9. ilovetesla Dumbest blocking I've ever heard Bruce Wayne I stopped rooting ages ago. Android has gotten so good that I don't need it anymore. Muzzy996 Good for you! Not everyone feels the same though, I know I sure don't. Tasker, Adaway, Greenify, Titanium, Substratum and GMD Gesture Controls are all more important to me than Netflix. The day Netflix stops working on my rooted devices (which are what I watch it on, not my TV) is the day I'll cancel my service. No big loss compared to losing root. Richard Markert Tasker is interesting but never felt the need for it. Adaway, titanium are both irrelevant on my S7, I despise gestures beyond simple swiping in the Cardinal directions, and if stock Android is so perfect why do you need to theme it? C64 I have a s7 edge and the stockrom is full of bloatware from Microsoft, Sansung and Google. More than 20 useless apps are included. So yes the s7 needed root. tim242 Wrong. Package Disabler, no root required. Richard Markert No, it doesn't. Everything not necessary for function is disableable. C64 You can't disable everything Muzzy996 Never said android is perfect, if it was there wouldn't be any competition in the market or users such as myself who feel the need to customize Android. Root is not something I push onto others, its just something that I want on my devices and I make choices about what services I use or devices I purchase based upon my ability to do it. Railwayman I take that you like ads, then? Using a non-rooted Samsung without Taller would be like using a feature phone again but with ads. Having an automated device without ads and bloat is certainly a basic requirement to me. Richard Markert Adhell and Disconnect pro. What's an ad? Railwayman I don't see any ads on my Ericsson GF388 either. Don't have to install a single piece of software in order to get there. Ericsson win, Samsung loose.:) Your Samsung still has Google ad services and so forth running even if you are blocking them on the "non root level". My devices are completely ad free with Google ads disabled system wide and in all apps. Samsung loose every time even if their followers are trying to find different "non root methods" to "solve" things that other devices do without any issues due to... root. kostas110 maybe if you use some 500+ euro smartphone from 2016-2017 something that not everyone can do C64 I disagree, Android is one big advertising if you don't use root. Apps have ads (not every app has a pro version), internet browsing sucks without Adaway (build in ad blockers in browsers aren't great), YouTube really sucks if it isn't modded (watch a 30 second ad for a 3 minute movie). And devices are full of bloatware that can't be removed without root. Even the Google stuff are bloatware (kiosk, movies,music,books etc). I also like to remove alot of system apps and replace them with my own apps that i prefer (file manager, agenda, email, music/ video player) and i really hate duplicate apps on my devices. Also Titanium Backup is important to me. So Android​ without root isn't Android for me. jetscreamer01 I use adguard to block stupid ads in my apps. Now using any commercial apps is enjoyable. Richard Markert Samsung's Internet has the Adblock extension and it literally blocks everything. I also use Disconnect Pro and Adhell for system-wide ad blocking. Titanium Backup I never really used even back when I was rooting phones - it has been replaced 100% by Smart Switch. But then, I haven't needed to restore a backup (except for switching devices) in years, probably because I don't run janky community junkroms. Muzzy996 The only reason you feel that Smart Switch completely replaces Titanium is because you never used other features of Titanium that go beyond what Smart Switch is intended for. Things like shortcuts to freeze/defrost apps, multiple version backups or market management are useful to some even if they're on rooted stock OEM ROMs. They're not must haves for the masses though but some of us do appreciate their usefulness. Cyber_Akuma I hate this response. If anything, I have found far more reasons to root than ever before. Being able to create a backup image and install security/tracking software tat can't just be wiped/uninstalled easily is a big one for example. DJMix I really couldn't understand these kind of stupid moves. I mean I kinda get for an Android Pay or some banking apps to implement these limitations. But seriously, a frickin' streaming app? Afraid they're gonna get pirated? For someone who's going to pirate, they probably could just probably reverse engineer the apk and remove the limitations or basically use older apps. Do they really have some idle engineers that they're forced to implement useless feature? ddevito Guess I'll just pirate it all soon. Their loss. JD Fuck Android If OEMs would fucking provide updates for 5 years I wouldn't need to unlock my bootloader. I'm out. I'll come back when Google fixes this shit. Also fuck Netflix. Back to pirating it is. Christopher Bement My app stopped working on my N7 when I sideloaded 5.0. Got an error when trying to play anything. I went and dropped it back to stock on the latest patch and relocked the bootloader. All working fine now. Too fucking bad, Nougat is fantastic on that device, leaps and bounds better than Marshmallow. tehboogieman Which ROM and which N7 do you have? I still have the stock ROM on my 2013 N7 LTE and have been procrastinating loading an N ROM on it Christopher Bement 2013 LTE version and I was using Nitrogen OS (fantastic and stable ROM). I am now on the latest Marshmallow just so that Netflix will work. tehboogieman As long as I can side load it and sign in I'm still ok. It's a pain, but I'd live with that. But if NF blocks root users from signing in, I'm definitely cancelling and just use one of the very easy pirate apps. Fedup As long as you can side load... Sure. But going from "hidden app in the Play store" to "sideloaded app won't run" is probably on the menu. Wayne Randall I just signed up for Netflix so I could cancel it. I'm part of the group. tim242 You paid them... Richard Markert Hahahahahaha I don't even use Netflix on my phone (screen is too small) so I don't care. But man, the tears and butthurt from the root community is hilarious. Benjamin Walburn You're a very petty child. Richard Markert When something makes me laugh, I point it out. I do that even have a dog in this hunt. I only watch Netflix on my 75" LED TV. I'm just tired of root users smugness. Almost as smug as apple users. Benjamin Walburn You're tired of people being smug in their hobbies, so you gloat about the problems inflicted on them pointlessly? Petty and a hypocrite. Richard Markert What else am I supposed to do to remove the smugness? My name is…. Get a life maybe? Benjamin Walburn Why should you? Is another person's happiness really that painful for you? You already know that they accomplished nothing more than "successfully followed instructions." It seems like your purpose would be better served by targeting that, not just being a jerk. Humbling them is one thing, being an ass is another entirely. tim242 You sound like the petty child. Stomp your foot, becauseyou don't get your way. Benjamin Walburn Not only am I not doing that, I'm not not getting my way, and "stomping​ my foot" is not an example of pettiness. Your wrongness-density is impressive. My name is…. Who beat you as a child? Richard Markert Lol koiulpoi You're on androidpolice.com... making fun of the root community... and unable to see past the end of your nose... Don't you have anything better to do? Richard Markert Actually, no. I read Android police because they have the best coverage of software. koiulpoi I didn't realize I replied to you twice. You're all over this article, with really, nothing better to do, huh? Richard Markert Yeah, I'm bored. I'm probably done stirring shit up anyway, today is water change day on my fish tanks. lomsha Tard Railwayman Are you one of those Samsung Apologists that argue against root and proudly tell everyone about the perfection known as Grace UX... just to install Package Dsabler Pro because... something disturb all "perfectness" of their system? Trying to be an "anti-social elitist" is like proudly use Simple Finder on a Mac and tell everyone that you don't need the regular Finder.;) Richard Markert I use Samsung, but only because it offers the best mix of software and hardware for me. And package disablers are garbage. Railwayman I avoid Samsung like a plague because of Knox 0x1 Warranty Void, Grace UX (TW...) and pretty ugly hardware not to mention the software design, which looks like a cheap toy, both colors, design and all S-This and S-That they preinstall. Don't forget DT Ignite so the carriers can add their share. It is always amusing when the Samsung Apologist proudly claim how good it is to live without root and how "mature Android has become" when they are talking about a heavily modified fork of it. If Samsung could replace Google Play with Galaxy Apps, they would. The only thing restricting them from further modification is the CTS in order to be able to use Play. An unrooted Samsung running Grace? It would be like having a feature phone again. Way too many annoyances and no way of making it more pleasurable since the whole thing is... Samsung. The only area where there are some reminiscence of Android is under the About box. Samsung is a disgrace not to mention a complete parody on the concept of an Android device. Not to mention their followers who recently "spotted" the bezel less display (introduced by Sharp and LG followed by Xiaomi) because... the S 8 got it AND suddenly made it a "requirement". The most kind thing I can say about that brand is this: Samsung is for the Android device and platform what McDonald's is for the thing called food.;) There are way better devices available. Buying a Samsung is like getting a Big Mac (the difference is that the Big Mac buyers doesn't claim its superiority - while Samsung buyers always try to claim how "superior" their devices are). Richard Markert Everything in your first paragraph is purely subjective. I find the design of the Pixel to be ugly, boring and derivative. AOSP design language doesn't appeal to me. I also think Samsung's software suite is better than Google's. My 935U doesn't have DTIgnite, but my 935V does...as does the Verizon branded V20, Moto Turbo2, etc. DTIgnite is a Verizon thing. Bezel less phones are sexy, for sure. That Sharp device was a Sharp device, and the Xiaomi has a CDMA radio so I could use it on Verizon , but just can't justify buying a thousand dollar device from China. It is stupidly gorgeous though. I use Samsung because I like the software design. I like the functionality of the base is and apps, and I like the S-app suite. I really miss my Note 7, and I'll be swapping up to a Note 8 when it's out. Don't get me wrong, Samsung phones have their negatives - chief among them is the fragile design and the screen edge touch rejection sucks ass. But for me, the positives outweigh the negatives. Other phones have bigger negatives for me. No IP68, no uSD card, no wireless charging, no SAMOLED display. Phone preference are always subjective. Somebody will always have a reason to pick one over another. Tell me, if Samsung is a "parody" of the concept of an Android device, what is your description of the perfect Android device? I'm guessing it's the Pixel. Railwayman Pixel is an ugly iPhone clone. The best Android device so far would be something like a Xiaomi Mi Mix running Resurrection Remix or similar ROM or something like a Mi Max but with perfection added through a Snapdragon 835, 256GB storage plus microSDand 6-8GB RAM paired with a 1440p 6.44" display or even 4K. 5000-6000 mAh battery. My Xiaomi Mi Max is excellent but would be even better with the aforementioned hardware (I can't fault is existing hardware but I am taking about a new model). A keyboard flipcover would be a great accessory as well. There are no device yet worthy of the perfect moniker yet but my Max is the best thing so far in my collection beside the Nokia Communicators and HTC TP2 and HD2 and also the Xperia Z Ultra when I do the holistic judgment. IP68? Sony all the way to me if I really insist. MicroSD? No need for a Samsung in order to get it. Yes, Samsung is a kind of a parody of an Android device die to their heavy modifications, restrictive policies, low price /performance ratio, carrier branding and Knox 0x1 Warranty Void. The upcoming OnePlus 5 looks promising - they usually get their things right. MicroSD on that one as well.;) If Samsung make a device without any BS such as restrictions, carrier links paired with good price / performance ratio I would be interested. Let's call it a Note Pro. What I don't like with Samsung are all Apologists making excuses for their policies. I have nothing against them as a company or production. They can make excellent products but their policies stop them right now. It is too much McDonald's mainstream and too little class at this time. Carrier devices are typically too mainstream than the unlocked ones. MadMartigan What are are you, seven? me me A primary reason to root is to run adblock because Google is way too greedy. So the irony, Google's greed means there's less reason to pay for NetFlix. Let me guess... shall we? Google Play Movies still works right...? Oh yes, so long as Google makes their money.... tim242 I block ads with Adguard. No root required. Mike | Homeless On Wheels People still use Netflix? Bit Torrent is your friend. dizel123 Exactly. Everyone should stop using Netflix. Not sure how I'm gonna get the shows i currently watch on Netflix from bit torrent since they won't be made anymore once Netflix is shut down, but at least I'll have my bit torrent friend tim242 Some people like to do things properly. Railwayman You mean - Do it with DRM? You can't buy whatever device you want because a content provider disagree. You can't use the system you want because a content provider disagree. You can't use the app you want because a content provider disagree. I need a lot of apps, ads and limitations for the so called "proper way" . The "improper way" is Samsung free, ad free and bloat free - and I don't need several apps because I have just one or two streaming apps, one media player, one book reader and so on. Fast and efficient system to boot. I think I prefer to do things "improperly". Richard Markert >The "improper way" is Samsung free, ad free and bloat free - and I don't need several apps because I have just one or two streaming apps, one media player, one book reader and so on. Fast and efficient system to boot. *sigh* I bet you think deleting the APKs from /system actually gives you more space in /data, too. Railwayman Perhaps you can tell me the benefit of having Kindle, Kobo and Nook instead of MoonReader for everything. The benefits of having an uprooted system, Netflix, Hulu and a couple of apps for different cable services instead of having just one media center would also be interesting to know more about. When we are at it: Why would I want to use a 3GB+ Samsung ROM when Resurrection Remix are 600 MB and the G-Apps around 340 MB? Richard Markert I dont use any of those. Phones are too small for media consumption. I don't have any video streaming or playback apps on my phone. Nor do I have book readers, but why wouldnt I want Kindle? It's the only way to access the Amazon library... Oh wait, I forgot, you do that believe in compensating content creators. Resurrection remix, really? If I put that on my S7 edge, I'd be wiping out half the hardware's capabilities in one blow. No Samsung pay, no edge panels, no pro mode camera, no AOD, no game tools, no GearVR. And im sure none of the little things I've come to expect in my UI, like direct calling and sliding a contact to call/txt. But I can move the clock to the other side of the notification shade, woohoo! Oh and does the installer for RR rom repartition the file system? Because if not, /system will still be 3gb, not 600mb. And on top of that, I'm immediately reminded of iOS when I looked at their screenshots. Railwayman So RR looks like iOS? Interesting. It looks like Android with Material Design on my device. I buy Kindle books but send them through a plug-in since the Kindle app pretty much suck in comparison with MoonReader. Sometimes I also buy from Google Play Books and it is also a trip through the plug-in for them and then into the MoonReader library. You see - DRM is a stupidity that must go way unless they create a device wide scheme so any app can authenticate and show or play back the content. I understand that Samsung phones are too small for media consumption. A 6.44-7 inch display is different - it works comfortably without the heft of a 10-12 inch tablet. Small displays below 6-6.3 inches are just too small. So your listed features of your Samsung are hardware? They certainly sound like software to me. Or do you seriously believe that Samsung use co-processors in their device like Commodore did on the Amiga? I can assure you that your Samsung contain standard hardware with a lot of subcontracted components, especially in the US market where they even use Qualcomm CPUs. Samsung Pay? Why would I use an OEM dependent payment system? My credit cards follow a standard, why should I pick myself into a specific device OEM just to pay? It makes no sense. It is like having a car that only runs on Citgo gas or a 4" Visa card requiring different terminals than my 4.5" MasterCard. Mobile payments will be a thing when a standard are in place. Payment systems requiring me to lock myself into a specific OEM just suck. Edge panels? Don't see the need. Don't like Edge displays with their optical side effects. Flat display or just slight roundness on the edges like the BlackBerry PRIV here. Pro Mode Camera? I prefer to have the Open Camera API so any app can get RAW from the sensor and do their thing rather than locking myself into the default camera app. I prefer Camera FV-5 or A Better Camera etc. The Snap Camera is good too. Always on display? Can set it up on my device but don't see the need when there are things such as Active Display and a lot of other options. Game tools? I don't see any problems with gaming on other Android versions so I just don't see what Samsung can add in this regard. Gear VR? Why would I want to strap my device to my face when there are dedicated VR headsets available for gaming consoles and computers? I certainly prefer to have a full headset rather than using my device as one. Call features? They could be good but carrier calling is old fashioned. I use Google Voice instead and wouldn't consider going back to carrier talk and text. Don't see any benefit with having a phone number tied to a carrier of SIM card. Having more than one for different purposes on the same device without SIM dependency is the modern way. I don't know if RR repartition Samsung devices so you have to check XDA. That brand is probably the worst when it comes to ROMs anyway and a lot of my dislike of them are related to that particular issue. Samsung is nothing more than the Big Mac of Android devices and no Gear VR or Samsung Pay (it is like having a McDonald's Pay) really change anything. A mainstream device with mainstream design with too many round edges and corners not to say fragile, batteries that wear out fast due to lower quality and fast charge (which stresses the cells heavily), a software design looking "something" , bloat ware, carrier BS such as bloat ware and also the price model, Knox and root/ROM restrictions, locked bootloadern - the list goes on and on. Mainstream degenerated art is what Samsung represents. But I know the existence of people who don't believe in freedom of choice other than the freedom of buying their Samsung from their carrier and then happily oblige and reduction imposed to them all the way down to the SIM card dependent phone number and roaming charges when they travel.;) They also consider Samsung Pay to be the best thing ever - a payment system that only work on a particular OEM. It really is like a car that require Citgo gas and is unable to run on Exxon or Esso fuel. Samsung just are the Big Mac of Android devices. There are just nothing "classy" over such a carrier mainstream brand. If you want to know what luxury are? Look at Vertu. derp_cookies So I agree this is a dumb move but everyone is overreacting by threatening to pirate content. This is a niche problem as less people root now, especially since Android pay won't work when you do it. So Netflix isn't any less accessible than it was before. I watch 99% of Netflix at home on my Roku. Luxferro It's not just rooting. My Nexus 6P is running stock google rom, no root, w/ just unlocked bootloader, and netflix is gone in my play store. Not that I watch TV on my phone... but my shield tv is also unlocked... so it's probably just a matter of time. Roh_Mish Dammit Netflix, you make me want to go popcorn time route. My current primary phone and my iPad are what I use to watch netflix and both of them is stock so i don't have anything to worry about but this just feels wrong. Between this and Amazon not releasing the TV app for my sony TV, which they support outside, popcorn time (and in extension piracy) just seems easier. Vivek Rameses This is why we have piracy. Miguel Angel But ...why? occono Distributors want Netflix to stop any possibility of making DRM-Free backups on the content. Railwayman Good luck with that. If it can be played, it can be recorded. As long as the Netflix content is visible somewhere a copy can be recorded so again, good luck with blocking. Mariano Moreira Even more strange is while Netflix app is removed from Playstore, Netflix VR is still.in Playstore. Manually flashing Factory Image for Google Pixel is how I get me OS updates and I choose to leave bootloader unlocked, rather than relocking every month.(which would include full wipe) So I guess they don't care about security for the few users whom might use Netflix VR with Daydream compatible device? tehboogieman I'm not familiar with the Pixel, but almost every Nexus device lets you lock without wiping all your data. Maybe that requires root though, I really don't understand the details on how it works, but hopefully you can find a way to do it. Mariano Moreira To clarify: In order for me to install Factory Image every month, I need to have Bootloader unlocked. Doing the Factory unlock will wipe the device. Locking the device doesn't wipe the device, but Factory unlocking the bootloader will wipe the device. tehboogieman Yeah, sorry I wasn't more specific. I use an app called BootUnlocker. It lets you lock and unlock the bootloader without wiping at will. Since an app can do this, I'm assuming that it can be done via ADB. Also it might only work on older devices, but maybe there's a way to replicate this action on newer devices as well Mariano Moreira I don't understand why Google is promoting Security by having the device fully-locked, yet still relies on ADB fastboot unlock/OEM Unlock commands to flash factory images? saf1927 Why are using factory images when Google provides OTA images too, and these don't require an unlocked bootloader, nor a wipe? jdrch It's not just Netflix. The HDHomeRun Prime app doesn't work on rooted 7.0+ devices either. Jsilvermist Good to know, will no longer recommend Netflix to anyone when I'm asked... James F News flash: when you explain to most normal people why you don't recommend Netflix, they won't care, because it doesn't affect them. D13H4RD2L1V3 This is stupid. I had to root my phone to be able to hide the navbar at any time I want and also to gain better battery management controls and other stuff that I sorely wished Google had added to stock Android way sooner. And I was considering a Netflix subscription. No longer...... Sruly J I know it's not fully a solution which is "worth it", but the app Custom Navigation Bar offers the ability to hide status bar/narbar without root. Although like you said, you had other reasons to root, so... Diar I pay for Netflix so I can watch the content any way I want guilt free, whether that's their app or other locations on the Internet. F their VPN blocking and DRM. If they make their app impossible to use, I just won't use it. They'll still get my money but they will lose any data/tracking since I'll still be watching their shows, just outside of their ecosystem. Dummies. ReedSolomon Between the SJW nonsense like Bill Nye, the ipv6 tunnel blocking (rather than simply defaulting to ipv4), increases in price, less and less quality content, and now this, I see little reason to keep paying for Netflix. robogo I understand Netflix' reasons, I really do - they need to protect their property and investment. But I can't really say I understand the way they're doing this. This is a good way to alienate the small percentage of power users who root their devices for various, but perfectly valid and understandable reasons. And no, this will not make me cancel my membership as long as the app works. Cancelling membership is a silly, overblown reaction to what is, in my mind, a minor nuisance. D13H4RD2L1V3 I personally just find it a dumb move. Seems like an easy way out. Dmitri Smirnov > perfectly valid and understandable reasons. And what reason would that be? Preventing people from ripping their content? Doesn't stop them in the slightest, root-detection in circumvented rather easily as well as safety net, we have PokemonGo to thank for that - a lot of people were motivated to crack it and they succeeded. > Cancelling membership is a silly, overblown reaction to what is, in my mind, a minor nuisance. Cancelling membership is valid form of feedback to the company, that trying to tell it's customers that they are not allowed to own their device that they paid their money for, if they want to watch a movie. robogo You misunderstood, it seems. A perfectly valid and understandable reason to root one's device would be, e.g. Xposed framework, theming support, tethering, backing up stuff with Titanium Backup, etc. Please read my comment once again. EowynCarter Well, if and when it stops working on my phone, what will be a major nuisance. robogo Agreed. I'll have to find another way then. But I'll deal with that when the time comes. Manbearpig I member when netflix released there app for Android and they did the same thing. I would just download the app and be good to go. After awhile though I stop rooting I miss it sometimes Cyber_Akuma I warned people when Pokemon GO of all things had a surprise update that silently added SafetyNet that this garbage was going to become more and more common. Mario RUN uses it too, and now Netflix.... soon apps everywhere are going to add SafetyNet and block rooted devices as standard practice. Google has been incredibly hostile towards people who actually want to own or have control over their devices or even their PC Software over the last few years. And over the last year google has been making SafetyNet more and more harsh, now even tripping if your BOOTLOADER is unlocked even if your phone is not rooted. Pokemon GO and Mario RUN were a small crowd, but I hope after Netflix of all things starts using it (and make no mistake, this is just the beginning) that people will finally push back against Google's hostility towards rooted users. EowynCarter Yeah. Or I might seriously consider going the iOS way. Though iOS would pose other problems. (Bye paylib) BillPosters I rooted my Android phone to get rid of the annoying camera shutter sound, and to prevent apps from stealing my contacts, and to basically take control of my device rather than letting Google run the whole show, and because of that I can't update Netflix? Good riddance Netflix. iKon I'm pretty sure you can go in the camera settings and take of the camera shutter sound?.... .. In some region-specific firmware versions or certain devices you can't do that. Railwayman There is a better solution: Declare the device a DRM free zone and use everything else. DRM to me is "Don't Restrict Me!" and an excellent reason to give certain companies the middle finger telling them to just go and F themselves. The most ironic thing here is that removing Netflix or using DRM otherwise doesn't stop piracy. On the contrary - By buying and using DRM content you get to travel in the cargo hold with no heating while the pirating consumer get first class service: more content, no restrictions, no copyright trailers or ads before the movie start and stop on. Even better: They can use whatever apps or ROMs they want. Would I unroot my device in order to get DRM content onboard? No way!!! If Netflix are so scared - block the client on Mac OS X and Windows et al. Piracy doesn't usually happen with an Android device as a source but rather computers and HDCP rippers. Another thing also to the DRM companies: Everything that can be played back can be recorded! (Good old piracy saying) Netflix out, Fusion with Exodus, SALTS and Phoenix in. Kodi with Rapier skin is much nicer than the Netflix client and Trakt integration make this way a much better one than going down the DRM route, sitting with an uprooted stock ROM and Netflix.;) TechJunkie198 ? netflix isn't scared. the studios require the drm. and netflix isn't concerned with the small percent of users who root their devices. Railwayman Doesn't matter. Go and enjoy your DRM services.;) DRM is a pest and that is why the pirating community offer a superior product. It is easier and more hassle free to just put Netflix where they belong and use Exodus et al or MovieBox or Terrarium TV and so on. To those who now consider unrooting because of Netflix: Just don't - use other services instead. Richard Markert So when everybody takes your advice and uses a service that doesn't compensate anybody in the content creation business, and all the high-quality media is gone, don't go crying about there being nothing good to steal anymore, k? Railwayman Even better: DRM and proprietary vendor lock in are scrapped and replaced by standards. If they want some kind of protection - make it device wide and linked to the account signed in so playback works in different apps - only thing needed is to call the system wide authentication system. I am against DRM and vendor restrictions. Original content without any of the BS is what the world need. Piracy is a symptom of several problematic things such as geo restrictions, root restrictions and the failed idea of the "right of no distribution" - i.e. the content exist but stubborn companies deny distribution using silly arguments. I always remove DRM from purchased content in order to have full control including the basic right of using whatever app or equipment for playback. Richard Markert Start developing the solution, and start a content creation company that can compete with the big boys when it comes to quality content. Or, you can sit around and whine online about the content creators not wanting the people who don't follow rules to play in their gated sandbox and get mad when you crawl over the fence. Railwayman I take that you like DRM and proprietary vendor lock-in. It is easy to avoid the gated sandbox so no need to whine. It is easier to just fire up Exodus rather than relocking the bootloader and flashing a stock ROM or remove SuperSU in favor of Magisk just to be able to get Netflix. DRM is such a waste of time. It's not necessary to develop a new service since the content are available DRM free already. Standards for media and books etc does exist or did you miss EPUB, PDF, AAC, MP3, MP4 and so on? Perhaps you prefer such a format as ZNO or Apple modified EPUB that only works with iBooks? saf1927 Magisk seems to do the trick. Helios What about my non-rooted OnePlus One? It's also listed as incompatible.. '-_- 天地人 Don't OnePlus devices run a custom ROM and have unlocked bootloaders? Android Developer How can they block people who root the device from installing the app? The play store doesn't have this filter. Maybe after the install they do this check? Richard Markert If you're really an Android Developer, you would know that SafetyNet is what's doing this "behind the scenes". Android Developer I'm talking about the article. They say that Netflix blocks rooted devices, and I know that this isn't an option on the developer console. Google doesn't have anything related to rooted devices there. Ezio I have about 200 original blu-ray disks, go to cinema, and I'm Netflix subscriber. Now I won't get app updates (or even worse I won't be able to use it in the future) just because I like to use my custom rom. Thank you. This is really a bad move. AdjustedFlow I thought netflix was about providing a better service than piracy. Now they're literally pushing me back to piracy. What the heck? Dany If for "root" they mean administrator privileges, don't we already have that on windows 10? So why Netflix doesn't block desktop version too? P.S. by the way...whatever man! I was using Kodi more than this crap anyway... Miku is Best Vocaloid This means Netflix won't be getting my business anymore. Paul Sterling No worries here, when you're legit. Take my money, I'm not cheap. Give me a service, I'll pay you. I don't need to rob. What am I? 13 living with my mom using Napster? Naw, grew up. Don't have any Tim foil hats. My wallet grew up too. ast00 This is a dick move that could have been avoided. If they want us to pirate their content instead, we will pirate their content. We tried doing it the legal way, but they didn't allow it. Their problem, not ours. EowynCarter Umf. **checks google play ** No longer compatible with my nexus 6 . But nexus 4 still ok. For crying out loud! I'm not rooted or using a custom ROM. Pyramid Power netflix is just losing money. it's saying to those people, 'go to thepiratebay!' RemiV2 I guess I'll just keep torrenting then. Thanks, Netflix.

Netflix is a client app. If I can, with a rooted phone, fake my subscription, or somehow cause a major security issue, that is not a problem with me, that is a problem with you pushing out a vulnerable app to millions of users. Sure, it would be my fault for exploiting it, but there is no-one but you who managed to put the problem in place. A CLIENT app should not be anything but a front-end representation of an API run by your servers. The CLIENT should have nothing but a CLIENT ID to use with the API. The CLIENT should NOT be able to change JACK SHIT with the API, it should only be able to get search results, get access to encrypted streams, etc. If your client CAN change JACK SHIT (which one could assume is true, since you are so actively hiding your code) then you have a major security vulnerability... This is a problem with your code, not anyone's rooted device... Hell, you don't even need a rooted device to access the applications code, just download an APK of the app, extract it, and decompile it... Jesus netflix, get your shit straight you bendy pos... BahnStormer Netflix is used more on tablets and TV boxes, these tend to be used for several years longer than phones and even Google now only updates their devices for <2 years (Samsung / streamer manufacturer's do this even less!)... We HAVE to run the likes of Lineage if we want the devices to be secure! Bye bye Netflix, even Amazon Video lets us use rooted devices! jcopernicus People don't understand IP and lambast a company protecting it. Of course. RemixedCat well they got rid of 5 star ratings, deleted tons of shows I was in the middle of, and the roku app is hella slow and takes 10 freakin minutes to load (by comparison my OS install from power on to desktop was 8 minutes on my samsung 850 500GB SSD!!) Tobi I'm running LineageOS on my Oneplus One to lengthen the lifespan of my device. Why must I be punished for that? I'm going back to pirating content. StankyChikin Possible that the movie industry is pushing this? SkullOne Shhhhh. Don't use logic here. It's not allowed. It's simply easier to blame Netflix and believe that they have a vendetta against the teeny tiny, itsy bitsy amount of root users out there! StankyChikin Forgive me plz lol username_not_valid This isnt about Netflix, its about its content providers. There is this notion that you can copy files and therefore pirate content if you are rooted. We all know its rubbish, Netflix probably knows its rubbish, but that doesn't change anything. If Netflix wants shows, its has to abide by its license agreements. There is really nothing Netflix, Amazon, Sky or any other streaming service can do about it. The fact that almost all pirate content comes from PCs and HDCP by-pass devices doesnt mean a thing. TedPhillips at least in practice, unlocking your bootloader/being rooted has no impact on your widevine support level. now, i'm not sure if the oem could supply a high-level drm library on a pre-rooted device, due to agreements, but modification after the point of sale is a different matter. meanwhile, keep on streaming netflix on your 'rooted' computer - gasp!~ Richard Markert >meanwhile, keep on streaming netflix on your 'rooted' computer - gasp!~ I don't even need an admin account to steal Netflix on my PC. Since the Windows 10 app and browsers BOTH work over analog, all I need is an inline box with a DSUB VGA connector and simply capture the entire output from the VGA port. Valerie Frye-Preter Did they do this because of the stolen season 5 of Orange is the New Black? TedPhillips wasn't that stolen before it was available for streaming? so i don't see how it could be. TedPhillips when the device can be retroactively uncertified, as safetynet mutates over time, that's a step beyond the usual forced obsolescence of artificially short software support windows. now instead of buying a new phone every 18-24 months, it could be literally whenever they feel like moving the goalposts. Mike Hunt I don't understand. I am a Netflix subscriber, but will probably have to unsubscribe now since I bought a rooted Chinese mediabox for my TV. This sucks, as I liked and supported NetFlix's business model. Richard Markert Which box do you have? Mike Hunt One of these https://www.aliexpress.com/wholesale?catId=0&initiative_id=SB_20170514131212&SearchText=media+box+mini+m8s Brock Reed I'm not even getting the "not compatible" message, it's just not showing up at all. Ajmobileguru First DirecTV Now and now Netflix. I dont see the point. As if rooted users were pirating the streams or movies. Rooted users on non-nexus/pixel devices already were getting only 480p because of widewine crap and now this. Anunnaki This is why people switch to apps like Popcorn Time and Terrarium TV. Biga173rd Popcorn time still works? Anunnaki When I last checked few months ago, it was working. No idea about the current situation though. Biga173rd Okay Erin Andrews Oh that's easy, they block my device I cancel my subscription. Say goodbye to my 15 dollars a month. piggynuts Stopped playing Pokemon, stopped using Snapchat, next to go is Netflix. I refuse to say bye to root. BobButtons Magisk. While some say it's hit and miss with Pokemon GO (idk, I don't play it) it's never not worked for me with Snapchat/Android Pay/Mario Run. cliff_dangers Why does everyone freak out about a rooted phone but my PC which is wide open is not a problem? What makes smartphones so special? Doro Manekia ΝετΦλξ Ανάθεμα σου.Χα χα χα Το Μαααακα. Bewear I am not that upset because I rarely use Netflix on my mobile, I am upset because this kind of blocking will become a trend. BoFiS ugh, fuck you, Netflix, I pay for your serve, LET ME USE IT ON MY PHONE A.M There are some many ways around that LAME NETFLIX - Showbox Kodi Firestick with Kodi I can't see the point of Netflix when we have so MANY better apps out there that kill Netflix ErectBipedal That'll teach them filthy pirates for trying to pay us money!.... wait.... -Netflix probably Zxyon Rhysivz What could users with unlocked/rooted phones do with the Netflix app that other users can't? Loco Mole Netflix content isn't that much better these days, so if they choose to distinguish themselves by being a d*ck to consumers who care about using our devices the way we want to, then f u too, Netflix, I got plenty of other legit streaming content. Fedup Let's see... Piracy: $0.00, no ads, no DRM, no device/location/time restrictions Legit: $$$, ads out the as$, DRM limiting options, shows locked to specific devices, locations, etc. Keep on making the decision easier for us, Netflix. xyz Fortunately, the Pirate Bay is accessible from all devices and regions without any geo-blocking. berserksgangr Well, my Nexus 7 with Lineage it's not working even without root (error 9) Nick Riley This is utterly stupid! Corvus Dove Remember that time that making things more difficult for software and media pirates through DRM while possibly messing with legitimate customers paid off and prevented piracy? Me either. Asbjørn The problem here is that most users root their phone to get the updates that their OEM doesn't want to make available. If Android had proper updates, rooting would not be so necessary. Patel Nisha Root user here. How do I use Magisk for this? I have it installed and new to the Magisk(haven't had a rooted phone in a while)? Keletor Does it stop you from sideloading it? I mean really, if you are rooting your phone you most likely will find a workaround. Luxferro Not yet, but you can be sure the app will stop working in the future. Znuff The download feature is not working for me anymore. And the 5.x app is not working at all, just says I need to install the 4.x one (redirects me to the download page) Tim Get Roku tv or a fire stick cause no issues there and it isn't through Google then Biga173rd People still use Netflix? mlauzon And this is exactly how you piss off your end users!

The only way I can watch overseas now is using Mediahint.com - nothing else works. Luxferro Just use usenet. They are forcing their legit customers to piracy... DDS This move will not stop people from pirating their content, it will encourage it. Exactly the opposite of what they're trying to achieve. But tell that to the a**hats who control the money... Ubelsteiner And thus, Plex and Kodi become even more popular, as Netflix drives a nail into it's own coffin. Znuff http://i.imgur.com/LG3dXc4.jpg http://i.imgur.com/eNeuPCD.jpg Can not use the latest version on my device, it sends me to download the 4.x version. When I try that, the latest 4.x version has Downloads disabled for me (it used to work on this device). US Patriot No worries. I can live without Netflix, but I will NOT live without full control of my devices and data. Ricardo A. Fragoso For those who want root at all cost there's still a chance to get movies with ChromeCast Support...

Nick Coad I can guarantee you that Netflix doesn't make these choices willingly. The production companies they purchase shows off are notoriously backward when it comes to technology and unfortunately Netflix relies on them to survive.

To that end, the Investing News Network profiles here 5 top companies in the Iaas space for investor consideration. « What is Cloud Investing? Jocelyn Aspa • May 15, 2017 Add Comment The cloud computing market is an incredibly dynamic, often confusing, space. Although millions of companies and individual consumers rely on the cloud, most have an ill-defined understanding of what this technology actually is. Cloud computing can be categorized as: Software as a Service (SaaS): applications that are used in the cloud environment (e-mail and communication features); Platform as a Service (PaaS): platform that such applications are running on (databases and web servers); and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): infrastructure supporting the platforms (servers, storage, and virtual machines). The companies operating in each of these spaces are quite varied. While the SaaS market is saturated with public and private companies, many in the mid- to small-cap range, the IaaS market is absolutely dominated by the major tech monoliths who have the funds, technology and infrastructure to support this service.

Click below to get your copy. Get My Free Report Click here to download for free As such, here, the Investing News Network (INN) profiles the top cloud computing companies that dominate the IaaS space.  Amazon Web Services (NASDAQ:AMZN) Amazon Web Services is a subsidiary of Amazon.com, and offers a suite of cloud computing services which constitute an on-demand computing platform. These services operate in 42 availability zones with 16 geographical regions across the globe. Eight more availability zones have been announced, with three additional regions included in those plans. More specifically, these services provide database storage, content delivery and other functionality which enables businesses to scale up and grow outward. Year to date, Amazon.com has seen 27.75 percent growth in stock price to $957.97 as of 4:40 p.m. EST on May 15. However, this figure may be slightly misleading, as it reflects the entirety of Amazon.com’s business, rather than just Amazon Web Services. Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Like Amazon.com, Google–or Alphabet–is an immense company, and its cloud computing segment is nestled within its many other divisions. Google Compute Engine delivers virtual machines running Google’s data centers and worldwide fiber network. The IaaS’s tooling and workflow support helps scalability and load-balanced cloud computing. Customization is a key element of Google’s cloud computing infrastructure, encouraging consumers to experiment with multiple configurations in order to optimize the service for their specific needs. On a year-to-date basis, Google’s stock price has increased 21.04 percent to $959.22 as of 4:40 p.m. EST on May 15. IBM (SoftLayer) (NYSE:IBM) SoftLayer Technologies is a dedicated server, managed hosting and cloud computing provider. The company provides cloud IaaS for a growing number of data centers and network points of presence throughout the world, with customers ranging from small startups to global enterprises. Although the company was founded in 2005, it was only acquired by IBM in July 2013. Today, its products and services include virtual servers, networking, big data solutions, private cloud solutions and more. On that note, IBM’s share price has been knocked down a bit so far this year, dropping 8.74 percent to $151.51 as of 4:57 p.m. EST on May 15. "Is Technology About To Change Mankind Forever?"

Get My Free Report Click here to download for free Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Like Amazon, Alphabet, and IBM before it, it goes without saying that Microsoft is an incredibly diverse corporation. The company is engaged in developing, licensing and supporting a range of software products and services, hardware, and online advertising. Essentially, Microsoft’s business can be broknd up into five segments: Devices and Consumer (D&C) Licensing, D&C Hardware, D&C Other, Commercial Licensing, and Commercial Other. For the purposes of this article, Microsoft offers cloud-based solutions that provide customers with software, services and content over the Internet by way of shared computing resources located in centralized data centers. Since the beginning of the trading year, shares of Microsoft have increased 10.12 percent to $68.43 percent as of 5:10 p.m. EST on May 15. VMware (NYSE:VMW) Like the companies listed above, VMware has a diverse portfolio ranging from virtualization software, to data and cloud to mobile devices.  In particular, the company offers  hosted Iaas offerings through its VMware vSphere virtualization technology. According to its data sheet, one of VmWare vSphere’s benefits includes the ability to run any app on any cloud. Like most of the companies listed above, VMware’s stock price has been on the rise so far in 2017. Year-to-date, shares of VMware have increased 20.22 percent to $94.65 as of 4:04 p.m. EST on May 15.

Google has announced a partnership with Volvo and Audi that will bring it one step closer to making Android an operating system for cars. Volvo and Audi plan to leverage Google's software in their car's infotainment units so you can access a more seamless, full-featured experience that includes Android apps and Google services. In other words, you won't need an Android phone to interact with the cars. Android O: What's the story so far? When is Android 7.1.1 Nougat coming to my phone? Android 7.1 Nougat tips and tricks: Get your teeth into Google’s goodness The carmakers essentially plan to build new infotainment systems using Android 7.0 Nougat. They will tweak Google’s OS and use it to power the touchscreen displays and digital dashboards in future vehicles. And similar to Android Auto, they will offer access to services like Google Assistant as well as Android apps. Android will even control functions like air conditioning, the sunroof, and the windows. Android Keep in mind Google has been rumoured to be working with carmakers on this since at least 2014, with reports claiming Google wanted to turn Android Auto into something that didn't need a smartphone and that could control a car's system. We'll likely hear more from Google about this at Google I/O 2017 this week. Check out Pocket-lint's I/O guide for more details on what Google could announce. Google has already said a preview of Volvo and Audio's new Android-based car systems will be on display at its developers conference. Volvo will demo its version on the Volvo XC60 concept, while Audi will demo its version on the Audi Q8 Sport concept. Volvo also said it plans to launch Android-based cars within two years.  Sections Volvo Cars Via: Google Source: Volvo Volvo and Audi will use Android as the base OS of its upcoming cars Harley-Davidson to keep making electric motorbikes after LiveWire Honda Clarity Fuel Cell preview: Driving the future of hydrogen?

When it comes to infotainment and connectivity systems, Volvo is putting all its eggs in a single basket named Google. The manufacturer from Gothenburg has announced a “close partnership” with the massive technology company to develop next-generation communications systems for Volvo vehicles based on the Android operating system. The system is set to launch on new models within two years.   Check out: Volvo XC40 Spied Covered In Swiss Cheese-Like Camo [35 Photos] 2018 Volvo XC60 Production Begins In Sweden FCA to show off Google Android-based infotainment system at CES   “We are making an important strategic step with the Google partnership,” said Henrik Green, Senior Vice President Research & Development at Volvo Car Group, in a press release. “Google’s platform and services will enhance the user experience by enabling more personalization possibilities, while Android will offer increased flexibility from a development perspective.” The partnership means that Volvo customers will have access to a wide range of Android-based apps developed by Google, Volvo, or other third-party developers. The manufacturer is also working with Google to update current Volvo models with Google Local Search; a location-based service app. The update will be released to customers using Sensus Navigation. As it stands right now, Android Auto is available in a wide variety of vehicles from numerous manufacturers, but it doesn’t function as a core operating system. Whether or not transitioning to an Android OS will affect the availability of Apple Car Play – a popular feature available currently available in Volvo models – is unclear. “We’re thrilled to partner with Volvo to bring Android into their next-generation connected cars,” said Patrick Brady, Vice President of Android Engineering at Google, in an announcement. “This partnership gives us the opportunity to deliver a more seamless experience to Volvo drivers through a full-featured infotainment platform and rich ecosystem of Android applications and Google services.” Source: Volvo Be part of something big Trending Ford GT, Old Vs New - Can The Older Model Keep Up?

It will launch on new Volvo models within two years.   The partnership promises to revolutionise how Volvo customers engage and interact with their cars. The large catalogue of popular Android apps – developed by Google, Volvo, or third party app developers – will offer connected and predictive services in and around the car.   “We are making an important strategic step with the Google partnership. Google’s platform and services will enhance the user experience by enabling more personalisation possibilities, while Android will offer increased flexibility from a development perspective,” said Henrik Green, Senior Vice President Research & Development at Volvo Car Group.   Volvo Cars’ partnership with Google reflects the ongoing convergence between the automotive and technology industries as cars become increasingly connected. Volvo believes smart partnerships are the future for the car industry. Using Android as the base operating system will increase speed and flexibility in the development and offer its customers the ability to personalise the connected in-car experience.   “We’re thrilled to partner with Volvo to bring Android into their next generation connected cars,” said Patrick Brady, Vice President of Android Engineering at Google. “This partnership gives us the opportunity to deliver a more seamless experience to Volvo drivers through a full-featured infotainment platform and rich ecosystem of Android applications and Google services.”   “With the advent of Android we will embrace a rich ecosystem while keeping our iconic Volvo user interface. We will offer hundreds of popular apps and the best integrated experience in this broad, connected environment,” said Henrik Green.   Volvo is also collaborating with Google on another initiative to update recent Volvo models by adding Google Local Search, a location based service application. This will be released through an update to customers with Sensus Navigation.   Further details on the partnership and Android OS will be announced at Google’s annual tech show, Google I/O on May 17.

One of the things the lineup is known for would be its camera, and our review found that the Galaxy S8’s camera to be pretty amazing. However it seems that maybe it just wasn’t amazing enough for the folks at DxOMark because in their review, the handset falls shy of the top ranked handset, the Google Pixel. During DxOMark’s review, they ultimately gave the phone a score of 88 for the Galaxy S8. This is one point away from the top smartphone which is the Google Pixel which scored an 89. This by no means indicates that the Galaxy S8’s camera is inferior, but it is interesting to see that Google’s Pixel handset is still leading the way. This is because Google’s Nexus phones were never really known to feature good quality cameras, with some bordering on terrible in the past, although Google has made some pretty impressive strides since. The upside here is that at the very least Samsung managed to beat out their rival Apple whose iPhone 7 scored 86. Based on DxOMark’s review, artifacts seems to be an area that the Galaxy S8 does not do quite as well in which might have pulled down the overall score. That being said, at the end of the day it boils down to your experience and if you like the results you are getting, and if you do then that’s all that really matters, right?

Not only is Google announcing a new ‘Policy Center’ today that will serve as a “one-stop shop” for publishers to control policy actions on their site, but the company says that soon policy actions will happen on the page level by default, leaving ads on non-offending parts of a site alone… Everyone can use an Echo Dot: Just $50! The first big feature is the Policy Center, which Google says will serve as a “one-stop shop for everything a publisher needs to know about policy actions that affect their sites and pages.” And it seems that is definitely the case, as it will provide “page-level action data,” reasons behind the policy actions that were taken against violating parts of publishers sites, and steps to resolve these issues quickly. In just a few weeks, all AdSense publishers will have more transparency about why policy actions were taken and the violations found, including page-level action data, so they can quickly resolve these issues across all their sites and pages using step-by-step instructions. The Policy Center also makes it easy for publishers to tell us when policy issues have been resolved and their pages are ready for review. Google says it has been piloting this feature with “thousands of AdSense publishers” and that is launching more widely “within a few weeks.” The second big change that Google announced today is its move from site-level to page-level policy actions. Until now, the default action taken when an offense against AdSense policies was found was to completely disable ads site-wide. This was obviously not very popular with publishers (we’ve been there ourselves), and so now Google is making it so that ads are disabled on a page-by-page basis. As we roll out page-level policy action as the new default for content violations, we’ll be able to stop showing ads on select pages, while leaving ads up on the rest of a site’s good content. We’ll still use site-level actions but only as needed. And when it’s necessary, such as in the case of egregious or persistent violations, we’ll still terminate publishers. Altogether, this means fewer disruptions for publishers. This is obviously very good news for publishers, as it means ads that sit near content that doesn’t offend will still be able to generate revenue as publishers work to fix the offending content. Google does say, however, that it will still take site-level actions in some cases and even completely terminate some publishers when there is evidence of “egregious or persistent violations.” More AdSense coverage: Google gives its AdSense website a fresh Material Design overhaul Stephen Hall @hallstephenj Stephen is Managing Editor at 9to5Google.

While WWDC has been a software-only event in recent years, it appears that might change with this year’s keynote and Siri Speaker. With Siri Speaker rumored to be unveiled next month, it’s time to take a step back and look at everything we’ve heard about the device at this point… Spigen TEKA RA200 Airpods Earhooks Cover Apple’s efforts to build a standalone Siri hardware device were first reported back in May 2016. The device at the time was said to be marketed as a high-end alternative to the Google Home and Amazon Echo. Like with most rumors, expectations and details regarding the Siri Speaker have changed as has progressed. For instance, it was at one point reported that the Apple TV would be the center point of Siri Speaker, but more recent reports have pegged the device as a truly standalone hardware product. Report: Apple planning Siri SDK for WWDC as it builds Amazon Echo/Google Home hardware competitor Report: Apple TV could be home for rumored Amazon Echo-like Siri speaker All in all, up until recently not much was known about Siri Speaker. It was essentially just a long-standing rumor without any details backing it up, but that changed early this year as more information started to emerge. A Bloomberg report last September arguably kick-started the focus on Siri Speaker. The report claimed that Apple was in the process of testing the device in employee homes after following a two-year research and development period. Bloomberg also shot down those rumors of the Siri Speaker being baked into the Apple TV. Apple’s rumored Siri-powered Amazon Echo competitor now in prototype testing – Bloomberg Report: Apple’s rumored Amazon Echo-like Siri speaker may feature facial recognition cameras Jump forward to 2017, Twitter leaker Sonny Dickson last month took to the social media platform to reveal a handful of details about Siri Speaker. Dickson stated that the Siri Speaker will offer some form of Beats technology underneath the hood, while also noting that it will run a variant of iOS. In terms of design, he pointed to a meld between the Mac Pro and UE Boom as a good example of Apple’s design. While Dickson’s report was met with skepticism at the start, it was quickly corroborated by reliable Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities. Kuo noted in an investor report that Siri Speaker will be positioned as a “high-end Amazon Echo competitor,” with one of its biggest selling points being “excellent” sound quality. The analyst explained that Siri Speaker will feature seven tweeters and a subwoofer, though it’s still unclear if there will be any user-facing Beats branding. Rumor: ‘Siri Speaker’ Amazon Echo competitor could see WWDC debut with Mac Pro style KGI: Apple likely to announce ‘home AI’ Siri Speaker at WWDC, positioned as high-end Amazon Echo competitor One big question many have about Siri Speaker, however, is whether or not the device will feature a display. While some reports have said it’s uncertain whether or not they’ll be any sort of user interface, others have been more clear. Just this weekend, KGI’s Ming-Chi Kuo released another industry note in which he reiterated much of what he had already said, but also noted that Siri Speaker will include a “touch panel.” At this point, it’s not explicitly clear what the “touch panel” will offer. It could be similar to the Echo Show, which offers a full touchscreen, or it could be something smaller, perhaps similar to that of the MacBook Pro Touch Bar. Apple exec Phil Schiller himself came out against the idea of voice-only virtual assistants, so it really come as too big of a surprise that Apple’s offering will incorporate some sort of display. Referring to the Amazon Echo and Google home, Schiller said: Well, I won’t talk to either one specifically, [I] don’t want to. My mother used to have a saying that if you don’t have something nice to say, say nothing at all. Obviously one hugely important aspect of the Siri Speaker is going to be Siri itself. Arguably, the success of the hardware product depends almost entirely on the improvements Apple brings for Siri. It’s no secret that Apple’s virtual assistant has started to lag behind Amazon’s Alexa and others, but KGI claims that Siri Speaker will be announced alongside “software development details for home AI.” As for an announcement, both Dickson and KGI have claimed Siri Speaker will see an unveil at Apple’s WWDC event next month, which is somewhat surprising given how the event has been almost exclusively hardware-focused over recent years. Though, it makes sense seeing how Apple did not hold its usual March hardware event this year. KGI: Apple likely to launch 10.5-inch iPad Pro and Siri Speaker at WWDC alongside new software Bloomberg: Unclear if Siri Speaker will feature display, Amazon open to Apple Music on Echo Phil Schiller says voice-only assistants are sometimes convenient So, that’s what we currently know about Siri Speaker: a standalone hardware device with a more powerful Siri, a touch interface, hi-fi speakers, and a WWDC unveil.

Weston Phippen May 15, 2017 News Share Tweet … LinkedIn Email Print Text Size The ride-hailing service Lyft said Monday it will partner with Waymo, Google’s self-driving project, adding drama to the race in Silicon Valley to develop an autonomous driving service—a contest that is playing out in courts and in cities across the country. There was little information on specifics of the deal, but it is sure to upset Uber, the market leader. Lyft is the number-two ride-hailing service, and its competition with Uber has been fierce: Lyft once accused Uber of sabotaging its business. Separately Waymo, which operates under Google’s parent company, Alphabet, has accused Uber in court of stealing its trade secrets. In that lawsuit, a federal judge on Monday ordered Uber to stop using technology that may have been downloaded by Anthony Levandowski, a former Waymo engineer who is now with Uber. Waymo was seeking a full injection on Uber’s driverless-car program, and while the judge did not go that far, the court did bar Levandowski from working on Uber’s autonomous vehicle project while the case is open. Levandowski is accused of conspiring with Uber to take thousands of files before he switched companies. Specially, Levandowski is alleged to have taken information on Waymo’s LIDAR technology, which helps the cars to see. The system uses pulses of laser light to create a digital map of the world around a car, crucial to helping it navigate the streets. Uber has denied claims it stole the technology, or that they are fundamentally the same. The judge, however, appears not to agree. In his decision, Judge William Alsup of Federal District Court in San Francisco, wrote,“the evidence indicates that, during the acquisition, Uber likely knew or at least should have known that Levandowski had taken and retained possession of Waymo’s confidential files.” Last week, Alsup refused to send the case to arbitration, and even referred it to the U.S. attorney’s office, which means it’s possible there will be criminal charges. He also requested on Monday that Uber produce a timeline of events leading up to Levandowski’s job transfer, and submit all their conversations to the court. The lawsuit now moves to a public trial. Lyft’s deal with Waymo will likely see the two companies exchange technology in some of the markets where they’re testing self-driving services, like in Phoenix, where Waymo is running a pilot program. The partnership is also an indication that Waymo’s technology is closer to becoming ready for commercial use. Waymo began its testing on closed roads, but is now openly testing its autonomous vehicles in states like Arizona, Texas, and Washington. Unlike Uber, Lyft hasn’t developed its own self-driving technology, so the partnership offers Lyft another foothold in the market. In April, Lyft partnered with General Motors, which bought the autonomous driving tech company Cruise Automation last year. The partnership between Waymo and Lyft was reportedly non-exclusive, and Lyft will continue to work with GM to test an autonomous version of the Chevrolet Bolt. Waymo also has its own independent partnership with Fiat Chrysler, and is in talks with Honda.

Weston Phippen is a senior associate editor at The Atlantic, where he covers news. Twitter Most Popular Presented by Kevin Lamarque / Reuters The Terrible Cost of Trump's Disclosures Eliot A. Cohen The consequences of the president’s reported divulgence of top-secret codeword information to the Russians are only beginning. If The Washington Post is right, President Trump divulged highly classified information to the Russian foreign minister and ambassador at a jovial meeting in the Oval Office. Here is why this is appalling, beyond even this president’s usual standard. Top secret codeword information is no joke There are multiple flavors of intelligence classification, from “Confidential” (which is often in the public record already, just not acknowledged), to “Secret” (usually, though not always available if you know where to look—or are willing to wait a few days), to “Top Secret” which is beginning to be serious. The codewords, which security officials began using in World War II to protect signal intercepts (e.g. ULTRA), tell you whence the information was derived—so Top Secret/codeword material really has to be protected. Any of us who have had those kinds of clearances have gone through repeated trainings about how to safeguard such material (cover sheets, multiple envelopes, proper paragraph marking, etc.). And if you hope to keep your job and stay out of jail, you take it seriously. You do not have access to any and all compartments if you have a top-secret clearance. This, apparently, is some of the information that Trump blew. Continue Reading Russian Foreign Ministry Photo via AP Foreign Leaders Have Realized Trump Is a Pushover David A. Graham The president’s reported disclosure of classified information to Russia is only the latest example of the self-proclaimed great negotiator conceding to officials from overseas everything they want. The pattern has become clear: A foreign official comes to President Trump. They speak. The official leaves with what he or she wants, and Trump emerges chastened, having reversed a major policy, or both. A Washington Post report Monday night revealed the latest and most embarrassing of the incidents. During an Oval Office meeting last week with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Sergei Kislyak, Moscow’s ambassador to the U.S., Trump reportedly revealed classified information about an ISIS terror plot that was so sensitive that the U.S. did not share it even with its closest allies. The story has since been confirmed by multiple outlets, and while the White House has pushed back, it hasn’t disputed any specifics of the story. While the president is legally entitled to disclose that information, the slip could jeopardize cooperation with allies, and it makes a hypocrite of Trump, who repeatedly criticized Hillary Clinton, his Democratic rival for president, for far more minor mishandling of classified info. Continue Reading Philip Montgomery His Kampf Graeme Wood Richard Spencer is a troll and an icon for white supremacists. He was also my high-school classmate. On December 17, 2007, the libertarian magazine Reason held a Christmas bash—a “Very Special, Very Secular Christmas Party”—at its office in Washington, D.C. The guest of honor, the late Atlantic book critic Christopher Hitchens, tugged liberally on his drink and gave a speech about how the holiday season was oppressive (“like living in fucking North Korea”). Then near the height of his powers as an anti-theist pamphleteer, Hitchens led the crowd in a tuneless rendition of Tom Lehrer’s “A Christmas Carol,” before slipping away and leaving the guests to the open bar and the mistletoe. Among those guests was a figure from my past. I had not seen Richard Spencer in more than 10 years. He was not yet known as our generation’s most prominent white supremacist. I remembered him as my eighth-grade-chemistry lab partner and high-school classmate. We spotted each other and walked closer, circling uncertainly for a few seconds, before he spoke my name and confirmed that a wormhole had indeed opened from late-1990s North Dallas.

Amy Zegart If you’re known as someone who cannot keep a secret, the world’s secret-keepers are not going to tell you much. Today The Washington Post dropped the bombshell that President Trump had revealed classified information about the Islamic State to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak when the three of them met at the White House last week. You know a story is big when it gets as many concurrent visitors as the story about the infamous Access Hollywood video. There was no hiding near bushes in the dark this time to walk back the damage. Deputy National-Security Advisor Dina Powell declared the story “false,” and the administration also called out the big guns, with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and National Security Advisor H.R. McMaster dutifully rushing into the breach to discuss the breach, using oh-so-carefully worded statements about how the president did not reveal “sources or methods” or any “military operations” that were not already known publicly. Continue Reading Alexander Shcherbak / TASS via Getty What Did Donald Trump Tell the Russians? David A. Graham A Washington Post story claims that the president divulged highly sensitive intelligence received from an ally in a meeting with the Russian foreign minister and ambassador. Last Wednesday, security experts nearly had a conniption when they realized that President Trump had welcomed Russian state media into the Oval Office. It turns out that was the least of the security breaches that day. The Washington Post reports that Trump revealed classified information about ISIS, acquired from an intelligence partner, about a plot to use laptop computers in terror attacks. The newspaper held back details of what Trump told Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Russian Ambassador to the United States Sergei Kislyak. Greg Miller and Greg Jaffe write: The information Trump relayed had been provided by a U.S. partner through an intelligence-sharing arrangement considered so sensitive that details have been withheld from allies and tightly restricted even within the U.S. government, officials said. The partner had not given the United States permission to share the material with Russia, and officials said that Trump’s decision to do so risks cooperation from an ally that has access to the inner workings of the Islamic State. Continue Reading Zohar Lazar How Pixar Lost Its Way Christopher Orr For 15 years, the animation studio was the best on the planet. Then Disney bought it. A well-regarded Hollywood insider recently suggested that sequels can represent “a sort of creative bankruptcy.” He was discussing Pixar, the legendary animation studio, and its avowed distaste for cheap spin-offs. More pointedly, he argued that if Pixar were only to make sequels, it would “wither and die.” Now, all kinds of industry experts say all kinds of things. But it is surely relevant that these observations were made by Ed Catmull, the president of Pixar, in his best-selling 2014 business-leadership book. Yet here comes Cars 3, rolling into a theater near you this month. You may recall that the original Cars, released back in 2006, was widely judged to be the studio’s worst film to date. Cars 2, which followed five years later, was panned as even worse. And if Cars 3 isn’t disheartening enough, two of the three Pixar films in line after it are also sequels: The Incredibles 2 and (say it isn’t so!) Toy Story 4. Continue Reading Kevin Lamarque / Reuters Republicans Display a Mix of Defense and Alarm on Trump Allegations Clare Foran The Washington Post report on the president’s conversations with Russian officials marks the second time in less than a week that the administration has sent congressional Republicans scrambling. Updated on May 15, 2017 at 7:45 p.m. After a report surfaced on Monday that President Trump shared classified information with Russian officials during an Oval Office meeting last week, some Senate Republicans initially rushed to defend the president, while other GOP lawmakers, as well as congressional Democrats, expressed alarm. “It’s no longer classified the minute he utters it,” Republican Senator Jim Risch said, according to Talking Points Memo’s Alice Ollstein. Risch reportedly noted that the president “has the ability to declassify anything at any time without any process.” Republican Senator John McCain initially took a similar tack. “We certainly don’t want any president to leak classified information, but the president does have the right to do that,” he said, according to the Associated Press’s Erica Werner. On Twitter, however, McCain shared the report later in the evening and wrote: “If true, deeply disturbing….” Continue Reading Kevin Lamarque / Reuters When Trump Called Divulging Secrets to Russia Treason Matt Ford The president once called for the execution of Edward Snowden as a “traitor” who had “given serious information to China and Russia.” President Trump, who reportedly disclosed highly classified information to top Russian officials last week, has long used other people’s indiscretions with secrets against them. He’s demanded investigation into the “leakers” he thinks are undermining his presidency. He wielded Clinton’s private email server scandal like a sledgehammer against her during the presidential campaign, at one point insisting he would “lock her up” if elected. (He hasn’t yet.) But even amidst all that, Trump once took an even harder line on disclosing classified information to foreign adversaries. In the summer of 2013, former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden leaked a massive trove of classified U.S. information to British and American journalists. The documents revealed secret mass-surveillance programs run by the U.S. government and allied countries, sparking widespread political debate and investigations throughout the West. Their disclosure also made Snowden a fugitive from a wrathful U.S. government. Shortly after leaking the information, Snowden fled first to Hong Kong and then to Moscow, when he resides to this day under temporary asylum protections. Continue Reading Carlos Barria / Reuters Braggart in Chief Peter Beinart President Trump’s incessant need to prove how important and successful he is proved costly in a meeting with Russian diplomats. Why did Donald Trump last week reveal highly classified, potentially life-endangering, intelligence to Russia’s foreign minister? Because he wanted to impress him. “In his conversations with the Russian officials,” reports Reuters, “Trump appeared to be boasting about his knowledge of the looming threats, telling them he was briefed on ‘great intel every day.’” It fits a pattern; Trump loves dazzling guests. After his April meeting with Xi Jinping at Mar-a-Lago, he recounted the Chinese president’s supposed shock when Trump told him, over desert, that the U.S. had just bombed Syria: Xi “paused for 10 seconds and then he asked the interpreter to please say it again.” When two Time reporters followed Trump around the White House last month, Trump told them that Ronald Lauder “went crazy” after being shown “the painting of George Washington above the fireplace.” Then Trump beckoned the reporters to follow him into his private dining room, where “You’ll see something that is amazing.” It turned out to be Trump’s newly installed flat-screen TV. Continue Reading Yuri Gripas / Reuters Donald Trump's Loose Lips Vindicate His Critics Conor Friedersdorf The implications of news reports that the president compromised intelligence sources and damaged national security. Donald Trump is not incapable of keeping secrets when it serves him to do so. He has guarded years of his tax returns more closely than any president in the modern era. But when the security of the United States, the lives of Western intelligence assets, the trust of U.S. allies, and the fight against ISIS are at stake, he appears to be less adept. “President Trump revealed highly classified information to the Russian foreign minister and ambassador in a White House meeting last week,” The Washington Post reported Monday, citing revelations from “current and former U.S. officials, who said Trump’s disclosures jeopardized a critical source of intelligence on the Islamic State.” According to the article, “The information the president relayed had been provided by a U.S. partner through an intelligence-sharing arrangement considered so sensitive that details have been withheld from allies and tightly restricted even within the U.S. government, officials said. The partner had not given the United States permission to share the material with Russia, and officials said Trump’s decision to do so endangers cooperation from an ally that has access to the inner workings of the Islamic State. After Trump’s meeting, senior White House officials took steps to contain the damage, placing calls to the CIA and the National Security Agency.” Continue Reading Church Militant: A Right-Wing Media Empire in the Making Daniel Lombroso A Catholic news outlet is fighting to save Americans from sin, while its founder grapples with his own complicated past.

Opinion: Google should fix its erratic reminder system Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/04/26 2:15pm PDTApr 26, 2017 39 Plus 1 on G+ 67 Share on Facebook 61 Share on Twitter Total Shares167 Applications Editorials Google Article Contents 1 Input methods 2 Quick Access 3 Notifications 4 Allo and Home 5 Conclusion The ability to quickly set a reminder on your phone is one many of us take for granted these days. Smartphones have seemingly always had this basic PDA functionality. Type ‘add reminder’ into the Google search box and you’ll be able to quickly set up a notification to jog your memory about something later on. You can even use the ‘OK Google’ voice command: “remind me to pick up the groceries at 6pm,” for example. Easy-peasy. For most people, this function is used occasionally for something really important they simply mustn't forget. And for those people, it probably works just fine. However, for some people (like me) reminders have become an absolute necessity. I hate to admit it, but I have a really bad memory. Truly awful. For this reason, I am almost entirely dependent on Google’s system of reminders to navigate through each day. My phone will buzz with a reminder around 15 times per day. Some of these are one-offs. Some are recurring. All of them are to remind me to do something important, and without them, there’s no telling what I might forget to do. Don’t get me wrong, I am incredibly grateful that I am able to set reminders on my phone at all. But my extensive use of Google’s reminder system has also led me to conclude that it is inherently flawed. The biggest issue, as I see it, is a lack of consistency. Allow me to explain. Input methods There are currently no fewer than 6 distinct reminder input methods available to a typical Android user: Google app (including Google Assistant on compatible devices) Inbox Keep Calendar Chrome Allo Assistant With so many options, there’s always a convenient way to add a reminder to your Google account, whatever you happen to be doing when the need arises. Not all reminders are created equally, however. Add a reminder using any of the first 3 methods in the list and you’re offered the same basic options, such as when or where you’d like to be reminded and if you’d like the reminder to repeat. Inbox insists on using its ‘snooze’ terminology to denote reminder time, which isn’t ideal but we can handle that. Keep reminders are obviously linked to a specific note so you may not always want to use this option if you’d prefer your notes list to stay nice and tidy. They do still show up in your reminders list on the Google app, though, and can be dismissed from there accordingly. You cannot edit Keep reminders from within the Google app, however. To do that you’ll have hit the “Open in Google Keep” link and go through to the app itself. A Keep entry in the Google app's reminders list. If the experience already seems a little messy, it’s when you add a reminder to the Google Calendar app that things start to get weird. Firstly, these entries default to an ‘all day’ event, which seems a little counter-intuitive. It’s not difficult to change this to a timed reminder, but it's a slight annoyance that this option isn't the default. Secondly, unless you have the ‘Reminders’ box checked, which makes all of your reminders visible in your Calendar, none that you set here will actually deliver a notification. Having this option checked may not be a problem if you have one or two reminders set over the course of the week. But as I’ve already explained, I have many, many more than that. So when I set the Reminders calendar to be visible, in order to have the notifications working, my Calendar looks like this… My eyes!!! It even includes distinct entries for recurring reminders. So if you have a reminder set to recur every day it will show up in the month view for every single day, rather than just the next instance. The result is a mess. Needless to say that completely rules out Google Calendar as a method of input for me. Unfortunately, it took a couple of missed reminders when I didn’t have the option checked to figure out that the calendar functioned in this way. This was obviously frustrating, and I was lucky not to miss out on even more important notifications before I realized they weren't showing up. Another potentially handy way to set a reminder is by searching ‘add reminder’ on the Google homepage in your browser (on desktop or mobile). Regardless of browser or OS, if you’re logged into your Google account you should be able to easily set a reminder this way. Of course, there are a couple of limitations here too. First of all, there is no option to set a recurrence if you use this input method. You can revisit the entry in the Google app later on and set a recurrence there, but that kind of defeats the purpose of being able to add it in your browser in the first place. The second issue is that you can only set the reminder for predetermined times of the day. These include morning, afternoon, evening, or night, as well as set times of on the hour (12:00) or half past the hour (12:30). This simply isn’t specific enough for certain tasks, and as a result, I tend to steer clear of adding reminders this way (except in an emergency), preferring the other more feature-rich methods. Quick Access At the moment there isn’t an especially fast way to enter a reminder input from your Android phone’s launcher. The ‘OK Google’ hotword (or Google Assistant on compatible devices) is easily the fastest method currently available, but there are still many of us who don't wish to talk loudly at our phones in public. Or even in private, for that matter. It's also worth mentioning that if you use the voice method this can often lead to misunderstandings or having to type extra information anyway. The Screen Search reminder button - simply not fast enough. The easiest solution would seemingly be to have a one-tap option to go straight into a reminder from your device homescreen. Instead, we have to long-press the home button (on non-Assistant devices) which brings up Screen Search (previously Now on Tap) and click the pink Reminder button, or we can type ‘Add reminder’ into the search bar or Google app. Both of these routes often feel painfully slow. We do have app shortcuts for Calendar and Keep, which is great. But each app comes with its own feature limitations, discussed earlier, which preclude me from considering either as a viable option. If only the Google app has an "Add reminder" app shortcut or widget, the process would be a breeze. App shortcuts - why can't the Google app copy this approach? If you want to view and manage your reminders list there are several ways to do so. The Google app has a reminders list in the menu, and this is probably the most complete, robust way to manage them. Inbox displays them as pinned items among your emails, or you can filter out everything else and view them in their own list, which functions similar to the list in the Google app. You can also snooze these in Inbox just as you can with emails. Keep has a section showing any notes that have reminders set against them, but doesn’t concern itself with any reminders not attached to one of its own notes. Lastly, Calendar (as you can see in the image further up) displays every single upcoming reminder alongside all of your other events, rendering it practically unusable. Notifications More examples of inconsistencies across these apps can be found in the notification shade. How each reminder is displayed and the quick actions associated with each vary widely. To dismiss this I must mark all 8 as ‘Finished,’ including two I can't even see. When you have multiple Google app reminders they are bundled together in a single notification, rather than separated out into individual items. The only action you can perform is to mark all as ‘Finished,’ dismissing every one of them at once. Another thing to remember is that notifications in Nougat only show up to 6 lines of content per app at any one time. So, in the example above there are two reminders I can’t even view without entering into the app. When you do enter into the app to mark individual items complete, that dismisses the notification from the shade entirely. If you were hoping to leave it there for the rest of the day as a glanceable to do list, you’re out of luck. Calendar reminder notifications similarly give you only the option to mark as done, but where they improve over the Google app is that you can tap into each individually and edit the reminder time on the next screen. This won’t affect the other notifications from the app. Inbox notifications are bundled rather more usefully, with each being individually expandable and giving the option to either mark as ‘Done’ or to ‘Snooze’. This offers you greater control over your tasks. While this is much closer to how it should be done, Keep refines this even further. Its notifications are also unbundled and come with two individual actions to choose from, snooze for an hour or snooze for even later. Swipe away the notification and you dismiss the reminder altogether, condemning it to the ‘Past’ section of the reminders list in the Google app. The exception being recurring reminders, which will still come back the next time they are set to recur. This is arguably the best way to handle reminder notifications, but you have to be happy to clog up your Keep list with reminders in order to utilize this. Keep's reminder notification - best in class. Your Google Now feed is yet another place you can interact with your reminder notifications. There, it’s possible to snooze reminders for an hour or mark as finished. But there seems to be little rhyme or reason to how long reminder cards remain actionable in Google Now. It’s not uncommon for me to see a notification in Google Now long after I’ve dismissed it elsewhere, and vice versa. While the cards remain useful in some instances, this isn't a reliable way to manage your task list. Allo and Home Some of you may have noticed that I haven’t mentioned how the Google Assistant in Allo handles reminders. That’s because for some reason these reminders are kept completely separate from all those discussed above. They won’t appear in any of the other apps and can only be viewed in the Allo app when it notifies you. The notification is displayed as a message from the Assistant itself and it doesn’t appear as though you can snooze it at all, not even if you ask really nicely. Allo isn’t the only way to interact with the Google Assistant, of course, the other being Google Home. You might think that reminders would be a key function of the smart home device, but curiously you still can’t ask Home to remind you of something, months after its release. Even the addition of multi-user support hasn't yet brought with it the ability to add reminders. Much has been written about Home and Assistant still feeling like beta products. With omissions like this, it’s hard to disagree with that. Conclusion By experimenting with Google’s reminder system across all of these apps and interfaces, it’s probably possible to eventually find a way to make it work for you. I would argue that you shouldn’t have to work quite so hard to utilize what is in essence quite a basic service. I’ve tried countless other Android apps in a bid to satisfy my reminder needs, and effectively replace my defective memory. But nothing seems to hit the right balance of good design, usability, and features. Plus, there’s no substitute for being able to easily access my reminders from any device on which I can access my Google account, something Google’s reminder system still boasts over every other option on the Play Store. Still, there has to be a way to merge all of these separate interfaces and functions into a less frustrating experience. I'm sure this isn't a huge priority at Google, but I can dream, can't I? A discrete Google Reminders app would seem an obvious solution. One that plugs into the other Google services but ultimately acts as a standalone master-app might be the best way to alleviate some of these shortcomings and offer the experience I expect from a service like this. Then again, maybe it’s just me. Maybe I’m the only person who uses reminders to quite this extent and I should, in fact, seek help. Hopefully, that’s not the case. And hopefully someone at Google uses reminders just as much as I do, and with just as much frustration. Tags allo calendar google app google assistant google home inbox keep subscribe ...

Anything I set using voice is getting marked as done within 10 minutes of them notifying me. At first I thought I was crazy, I was seeing reminders in my Inbox that I had set while driving, but an hour later I'd say to myself "Wait didn't I set a reminder to do X?", only to find I HAD created the reminder, but it was marked as done. I can't figure it out! I opened a ticket with Google only to have some rep tell me I needed to clear my cache, but it still happens even when all my devices are off and browsers closed. Kevin Luther Yup. They have been really messed up. I keep finding them marked as done when j never even got the notice Simon Levin Yes that happens to me all the time. I've come to not rely on reminders for anything serious. catalysto I regularly encounter quirks like this with Google reminders. It's for this reason (and all the other stuff Scott said) that I only ever interact with them via Inbox. Fortunately, I enjoy using Inbox, so using that method is relatively painless for me, but for those who don't... Well hopefully the nightmare ends soon.

They respond within moments, but that response is always boilerplate like you mentioned. ShahinTr I just use events. I never bother using reminder, it's an absolute waste of time and space on calendar. Charles222 I've largely abandoned reminders in favor of calendar events and todoist. Todoist in particular, since it has equally-favored apps for the three OS's I use and Home support. David Ruddock Todoist seems very robust. I always consider trying it, then just don't because most of my reminding comes from calendar events, as you say. I want the solution to feel as integrated as possible. Charles222 I usually roll with Google auto-creating events in calendar for me like they do, and the random stuff that doesn't float through my email goes to Todoist. Scott Scrivens I have tried Todoist but I didn't like it. I don't actually remember why though...maybe I'll give it another shot. Charles222 Having a few Homes around the house is what pushed it for me. I'll remember some random-ass thing I need to do in the future, and I don't take my phone to bed (or have it particularly nearby generally at home) as a rule...but I do have a Home in the bedroom and just being able to talk to to Todoist to set up an event is fantastic. Scott Scrivens That sounds pretty great. If I get Home I'll definitely check it out. Also "Homes around the house" sounds funny. Maybe Google didn't think the name through. Charles222 haha, yeah, I suppose it does. Waveblade Second on Todoist, just replacing it outright is better and the interface is way better than any other ones I've used. The other thing is context awareness is great. "Send email today at 4PM #" will figure out where it all goes. That is the killer feature about it wheelingdad If you need to set 15 reminders a day then you might look inward instead of trying to create/change a system that fits your issue. Just saying... Scott Scrivens pls halp Bruce Wayne Exactly. 15 reminders in a day is just absurd. I saw one of his screenshots and there was a reminder to "charge his phone". That says it all. bekifft Pretty sure that one was for example, I doubt his dog's name is actually Fido. I admit it is kind of unlikely you'd get that many reminders in one notification, but it does illustrate the point that Google hasn't quite thought the system through. Malarie Perelshteyn People with legit memory problems need 15 reminders a day, so instead of saying to set less reminders, maybe they should just fix it. Matt That calendar is what Leonard from Memento would have if they made that movie today. XerBlade Everything was just peachy for me using Inbox's reminder tools for all of this... until recently. For the last couple weeks, Google has made an incredibly asinine change where time-based notifications will automatically be marked as Done in just under an hour if you don't do it yourself. Which really mucks things up when you're, what's a simple example that's easy to convey... Say you set a reminder a while back that you forgot about (which is pretty much why you set a reminder in the first place), and it goes off while you're in a movie (and you didn't adjust it to go off later on after you're back from the movie beforehand because, you know, you don't have eidetic memory which is why you need reminders in the first place). Said reminder goes away on its own before the movie ends, so you never actually see it. That kind of BS has been happening to me DAILY since this started. [Notifications you just leave sitting in your inbox forever and never "Snooze" are fine though. Yay.] Kevin Luther I have been missing so many reminders lately as well. It's utter garbage destinyhud Here is what i do. I use google app to set all reminders. it will flow to calendar and keep is just for note taking. Now i set calendar events for more important thing to be reminder me a second time just to be be careful like my monthly mortgage Scott Scrivens This is essentially what I do currently. I wish it just worked from everywhere though. blahmoomoo Allo's subscriptions are kind of broken anyway, though I don't know if that also applies to recurring reminders. I told Allo to tell me the weather every morning, but if you don't chat with the bot on occasion, it stops doing that after about a week. Then I forget that it was supposed to remind me about the weather for a few days after each time that happened. So I have ultimately given up on it. EDIT: to be clear, the subscription is still there. It just forgets to keep sending it after a while if you don't talk to the bot, intentionally or not. 4Ui812 Google needs to fix more than just the reminder system. This is probably the least of their problems. Grey They should also bring Reminders to Gmail. Why is it Inbox-only? The other Inbox feature, Email Reminders, should be baked into the next version of Google. After that, what makes Inbox different? Jason Bell The biggest issue I've been having is that reminders don't always give me a real notification. It's always there in the Google App when I open it, but sometimes there's no notification. sam1331 I was just looking into this today. I've become increasingly dependent on reminders, and basically use it as my to do list these days. However, it definitely could be improved. The thing about the notifications is huge, if I have multiple pop up I have to click on the notification to dismiss one, and then the others are no longer sitting there in my notifications. Then I have to reschedule them to get them to sit there again, which is the whole point of the entire system. If they disappear from my notification shade, how will I remember to do them? I might as well not even use Google's reminder system at all then. It's just so convenient to type "remind me to..." in the search box and have it add whatever it is. MisterAlex I recently got a reminder notification for a "when I get home" reminder that I'd set over a year ago. No freakin' clue what made this particular arrival at home special enough to trigger it again... :v bekifft This happens to me too. Not so extreme, but it seemingly sometimes takes Google quite a while to realize I'm home for reminders. Which is strange because they bloody well know that I'm home, they spend all day burning through my battery to make sure they know where I am at all times. Jen Once they get all THIS stuff straightened out, I'd love the ability to set reminders by Time AND Location. For example, I'd love to say "Remind me to do laundry when I get home tonight" while I'm still at home in the morning... Right now, that would just "remind" me immediately since I'm still at home, or if I set it to a specific time, it might remind me before I get home in the evening or after I've been home a while. It'd also be useful for locations that have open/close times, like stores, where a location-only reminder won't be helpful if you frequently walk by at a time when it's closed. Having a Time + Location context would be immensely helpful! N8SLC This works for me. I use the assistant mostly. Scott Scrivens This. This would be so useful. leganzish I have always wanted this for those exact same scenarios. That would be so powerful. PHLAK I also rely on reminders heavily. Hover, I limit myself to just using them through Inbox (both on the web and phone) to avoid all this complication. A stand-alone reminders app to "unify" reminder functionality would be awesome. Crossstick You & me Scott. I'm on a 12 person sales team plus a manager. NO ONE, but me uses automated reminders. I can't live without 'em. Ever since the original Palm Pilot ! Keep is my main workhorse for the past couple of years. Alex Renna This is the reason I switched to using a To-Do app (Todoist). There used to be a Gmail add-in (#todo) that stopped development after Google implemented Reminders on Calendar, and acted like you stated, only one occurrence that would move days until it was completed. If that made a come back I would be a happy man. kimbo I haven't had to make any reminders recently but I thankfully haven't experienced these issues before Cakefish I use Keep reminders a few times a month for important stuff like meetings and deadlines. Dozens of reminders a day? I wouldn't want to be that dependant on technology to function properly in everyday life. I can usually remember the mundane everyday stuff pretty well on my own, such as remembering to buy food and eat it, drink to keep myself hydrated, charge my phone when the battery gets low, go to the toilet, breathe in and out etc. Everyone's different though! Each to their own. Shakil Shaikh Jut install Tasks, the app formally known as Astrid: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.tasks Workflow wise, resizable/fiterable widgets do it for me (they also provide a quick way to enter a categorised task). Persistent notifications help in some cases too. Mostly though, it's the only to-do app that offers recurring tasks on both scheduled date (every 3rd Monday) or on completed date (3 weeks since last completed). It'd probably be quicker and healthier than waiting for Google to create some kind of compromised workflow for you instead. Scott Scrivens I was actually an avid Astrid user back in the day. Miss that little octopus. My issue with this as a solution is that I always need to use my phone. I'm looking for cross-device/platform integration. LaserWraith I tried to use Google's reminders in the past but gave up for reasons similar to yours. Todoist keeps me on track now across all my devices and it's pretty great. Some flaws still, but a big improvement. Raymond Berger Have you tried TickTick? I've been using it for years and it was been absolutely fantastic. It works across many platforms and has a relatively simple interface but also plenty of options for power users. Scott Scrivens I have tried Tick-Tick actually, and I seem to remember not liking the UX. It's seems it's had a considerable makeover since then though so I'll check it out again, cheers. Jock Murray I use Business Tasks by Appgenix-software.com I don't think Google realise the importance of their Google Tasks. The ability to nest tasks and have descriptions/comments attached to each task, is critical. Keep users don't know what they're missing out on. Scott Scrivens Looks good, I'll check it out! pantagruel I use Business Calendar 2 with support for Google Tasks built in. Smarter choice if you use your calendar as well. bekifft Since we're recommending apps, this one seems the best, and uses Google Tasks as its back end. Come to think of it, I'm not sure Google Tasks even has an official front end anymore, but Google seems to have forgotten to shut it down. Link: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.splendapps.splendo Scott Scrivens Think I've tried this one before and wasn't overly enamored by the UX, sadly. Trip66 Been using it for years I love it...Bought it Immediately.+1 Rafael Reinoldes But it can't handle nested itens :( N8SLC You can de-select the reminders calendar. As for the rest, I think the sheer volume is on you. ;) Scott Scrivens You can, but then any reminder you set using Calendar won't work. morrisp Well, it won't appear (or notify you) on the desktop Calendar -- but will still notify you in the Calendar app, yes? N8SLC Yes, morrisp. :) Scott Scrivens Nope. It straight up won't give you a notification at all. It acts as though reminders are turned off altogether. If you set the reminder in another app, those will still notify you. But if you set the reminder in Calendar (app or desktop), and turn the reminder calendar off, you won't get a notification. Deeco PREACH AP!!! Please make more articles like these to highlight these simple anoying flaws. Let us be heard and get Google off​ their backside! ellett Why can't a reminder play a sound? As it stands now you can get an email or have a notification pop up, but everything is silent, which is useless if I'm doing something else when the reminder triggers. If I need an alarm, I have to set a reminder several hours in advance to remind me to set a phone alarm. F4LL0U7 If you're talking about reminders set through the Google app, you have to go into the Google app's settings and enable sound & vibration for those notifications. I think they're off by default. ellett Nope, I don't use reminders through the Google app. I do all of my calendar-related operations through Calendar. Putting appointments, reminders, notifications and alarms in different places is just plain wrong. F4LL0U7 Ha, you have a point. It might seem obvious, but you just might want to check and make sure the notification sound is enabled in Calendar also. I think that one might be off by default too. Sophie Yes, many of these things have been bothering me, too! The state of Google's reminder system is much like their chat/messaging apps: confusing and fragmented (Ok, maybe it's not as bad as the chat/messaging apps). Like the author, I also rely on reminders (my calendar looks alot like his!). I primarily interact with them through the Google app, as well as a script I wrote for the Linux command-line that allows me to quickly add timed reminders (Google calls them quick events) to a special "My reminders" calendar (I wish I could save them to the default Reminders calendar that Calendar and the Google app seem to use, but it seems off-limits to developers). If Google's voice-to-text translation was better, I would stick to the Google app, I really don't mind talking at my phone, in public or otherwise, but it's not great. I have to correct things so often that I might as well type it in half the time (hence the command-line script). bdbplatano 🍻 Here's to hoping Google's paying attention🍻 Wolfie410 My biggest issue had to do with recurring reminders set through Google Now/Assistant. I was unable to clear a reminder ahead of schedule, without completely deleting the future occurrences of the recurring task. The only other option was to wait for the notification to pop and then dismiss it. Not very convenient. Have beem using the splendo to-do list. Rudresh Another way is to set an alarm with a note, works best for me. Lateef Alabi-Oki I wonder how hard it is to create a single reminder service, with a consistent API and behavior, that all their front-end services and third-party apps can use? Just thinking out loud here. iCON You are talking about a company that has six different messengers... Scott Scrivens I'd say it's more about whether it's profitable, rather than whether it's possible. Sad truth. F4LL0U7 There was a recent article on AP (I forget who wrote it) about Google's messenger strategy (or lack thereof) that seemed pretty spot-on. I would bet their reminder strategy is pretty similar. bekifft That, and I don't think they've had a clear reminders strategy from the beginning, and probably still don't. With reminders tied into all these services, it's probably an engineering nightmare at this point. Bruce Wayne I can't imagine why you would need a reminder to charge your phone. Naxx ENVY ^ this , his phones on like 5% , hes like . i forgot something , let me check my list ... oh right yea charge phone . Scott Scrivens Because the battery on my Nexus 5X doesn't last the whole day. So a reminder to charge it at around 4PM is useful. I'm not always able to, but if I intend to be out of the house in the evening it's a necessity unfortunately 😩 Trip66 Many of these shortcuts can be added to the homescreen in most launchers and especially in Nova but I use the OK Google method and several times a day. "Remind me in one hour that at 2pm so and so is coming by to.... That type of stuff... and I plan my whole day everyday so I don't forget someone is coming by or I have to be somewhere etc etc. It's a godsend to me and I can do it all hands free and 90% of the time it's in the car via BT. Awesome.ability. I fix computers all day so I'm always picking up or dropping off and also people drop and pickup to me so it reminds me when so I dont leave if someone is coming over or I have to be to their place at a specific time. But I haven't had any issues with them being marked as done or anything and they always go off at the time I say to. Viral Kacha https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/5ee1efd75a870942aa10e7ecb1adcdfe05ac836338f4823d2d7a45180f970b2b.png "If only the Google app has an "Add reminder" app shortcut or widget, the process would be a breeze." Inbox app has the widget and it's quite neat and inclusive of all the features. Luzandro I also use the inbox widget, which works quite well for me, except when the shown presets for snoozing aren't appropriate (which is quite often the case for me, as the soonest suggestion is in the evening) it takes surprisingly many steps to choose something different Scott Scrivens Agree with Luzandro. It's probably the best option but still not as good as the Google app input method. bekifft Yes and ironically the Google app does not yet have any app shortcuts. Add Reminder and View Reminders would be two excellent choices. TedPhillips yesss. the bundling gets me since if i finish one reminder but have a few overlapping (but not too many like you), need to be very aggressive but also careful about notification shade grooming. out of sight out of mind and all that. A+ Simon Levin Thank you. If only Google cared to fix their old products. Nathan J For me, reminders have always been crap on both platforms. On Android, I used an app called Lotify. https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nll.lotify The nice thing about this app is that you have a ton of options, and a huge selection of icons to choose from, so if you have a lot, they stand out from one another. I expected iOS to be leaps and bounds ahead, because an iPhone just works, right? Not so fast. I found iOS lacking in that regard. Via Reddit, I found an app called "HiFutureSelf" that simulates a text message. You put in the message and the time you want to receive it. You can set a unique ringtone for the app. And when the time comes, you get your message. It suits my purposes. There might be better options, but I haven't seen any, personally. morrisp The stock iOS Reminders app is indeed buggy -- notifications sometimes don't go off. It's a big problem! I recently switched to using an app called MinimaList for most of my reminders. Ryan Warmack Business calendar pro hits the nail on the head for me. ilovetesla can anybody petition google to make adding birthdays and anniversaries to calendar easy Alicia Frederick Inbox has a widget you can add to the home screen on your phone for single tap quick access, which might help with the notifications since Inbox does them better. Jeremy Couch One thing that I hate is that when you dismiss Android notifications of reminders from Keep they mark it as Done. So I stopped using Keep for reminders. Very annoying. Ste Tan Excellent article. Reminders have been a pain for me as well throughout Google services. I've tried so many different apps—apps like todoist,etc— that just isn't as convenient for me compared to a native solution by Google. I eventually just went back to using Calender and keep for reminders and though it does become aggravating, I've grown to just deal with it since I need to use it daily. A Google reminders app would be perfect, especially since it would seemlessly sync and work consistently throughout all my Android devices plus any other device I have my Google account connected to. I really hope Google sees this article and takes it into consideration. Fabian Todt personally i like how google calender reminders show up, that's exactly how/why i use them: these are tasks/todos i have to do at this very moment so they are like an event/meeting. this is somehow similar to the getting things done method: i've got all tasks in todoist and plan them as reminders in calender when i have to do them. Neil S The article says that there is no widget for reminders that can be added to the home screen. I have one on my phone. The Google inbox app has a reminder set up widget which is quick to use. Just tape the reminder widget button and enter the reminder text, then hit the clock icon to set it for any time you like and to repeat if you like. Scott Scrivens You're right about this, and it does work well enough. I just wish Inbox reminder notifications wouldn't disappear after a random amount of time. Miguel Hernandez I know this may sound blasphemous to some in this community but how about Cortana? It has a widget that show upcoming reminders and easy add reminder button and is cross-device with Windows 10. Antonio Gabbiano Exactly the same thoughts that I have. The fastest way to add a reminder is via shortcut for Inbox. Hanny Yeung Google Reminder as a new separate app in 3...2...1... Btw, I use Loop for my recurring reminders. Good design & usability, plus I can track my habit performance (I saw Vitamins in your calendar and that seems to be a suitable entry for Loop). Everything else are occasional, so they're in Google, created by voice command. Agreed an app shortcut from Google app and a separation of each reminder in notifications would make life easier. Vivek Shah I completely agree with Scott. The reminder options in Google Calendar desperately needs a overhaul. Hope they're reading this. Polyterative Calendar is great but abbandoned by google.. I'm a power user and these annoyances are really bad bekifft I wouldn't say it's abandoned but it's definitely not a core product anymore. They made it to compete with Microsoft and Exchange back in the day, and it was effective at that, but that's not what they care about anymore. So actually yeah, I can see how it is kind of abandoned. _jack_ Tbh, that's why I use another app for reminders and to-dos. I hate this inconsistencies, and a dedicated service for reminders isn't a bad idea (especially when using them extensively). makapav Not to mention there is no option to make the reminder notification more aggressive: intensity, repeat, persistence. vodanium I really miss that, too! Sometimes I want a reminder to really grasp my attention to do the task at the very moment. In other cases, though, it is not an issue to miss the notification for a few minutes/hours - most of the to-do activities are like this. I've been using The Clock app for "hard" notifications, but it is far from being ideal: e.g. it can be used for reminders within one week only, no option for sophisticated recurrences (e.g. bi-weekly), etc. makapav In other words - it's a usability clusterfuck. fnquaso Actually, Google Tasks does have a (hidden) webpage: https://mail.google.com/tasks/canvas bekifft I've started using this app specifically for recurring reminders. Not sure whether it's a good thing or bad thing that Google leaves these gaping holes to third party providers, but here check it out: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bleyl.recurrence&hl=en Rafael Reinoldes Not to mention their task management system, We can create a task list in keep, export it to docs and suddenly they were not tasks anymore, while gmail still have a half-baked task functionality that doesn't support remainders, but supports nested items!! Rafael Reinoldes Forgot about the inability to import lists from docs to keep again Rafael Reinoldes Did you said 'chrome'?!? How could anyone set a remainder from chrome? Scott Scrivens Search "add reminder" in Google. As long as you're signed into your Google account you'll get this... https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/b7f84553cb8c9298712a98dc6a5f355c79fb13f00154d89a39eaa785046cdab9.png Rafael Reinoldes Not working here, even in an anonymous tab, probably only available in US, tested in android and desktop from Brazil. Scott Scrivens Interesting. I'm in the UK and it works for me. Maybe not everywhere though. Sorry to get your hopes up. You are signed into Google right? Rafael Reinoldes I am logged into google, mainly, because I get a lot of value by syncing stuff across different computers. Scott Scrivens That's annoying, not sure why it wouldn't work in Brazil :( Nathan Type "add reminder" in the Chrome address box. I do it all the time on my PC because it is faster than picking up my phone, but I was also experiencing problems with notifications for reminders set in Chrome not appearing on any of my devices. Now I know why. Rodrigo Chiong It's true that the reminders situation a mess. But I do see a launcher shortcut to add reminders from Inbox that work alright. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/dc3b51117bfc2b134dc2fdf28b442f4389a3730166e304ee5ae2969fbe776d83.png Scott Scrivens This is true, and it does work pretty well. The only issue is that, as others have pointed out, Inbox reminder notifications seem to disappear after a little while. I like to leave my reminder notifications in the shade until I get to them. Rodrigo Chiong Well that's also true. You never know if the notification will come from Calendar, Keep, Inbox or the Google app and they all behave differently (particularly the snooze feature) KB You don't need "add reminder" in the search box, just typing "reminder" is sufficient. Dan While adding a reminder in chrome only allows times in 30 minute increments, there is a workaround for at least this part: include the specific time (and optionally the actual reminder text itself) in your 'add reminder' search: 'add reminder 7:40pm' will pre-fill the time for you (although changing the time will still only allow the 30 minute incremented time values) or just search the entire reminder: 'add reminder take out the trash at 7:40pm' or 'remind me to take out the trash at 7:40pm' hopefully this helps someone else Scott Scrivens Great find. As a way of crowdsourcing fixes this is proving very worthwhile. Chris Sanner lessee....what else about reminders bugs me - 1) if you want to dismiss a recurring notification early one dya your only option is to dismiss it *forever* 2) no "repeat x time after completion" option. this is the thing that most keeps me on other todo apps. I might not replace my furnace filter ON THE DAY it's due - but I want to be reminded again a month after I *DO* replace and dismiss it. Joe Dink AMEN! So true! It's pathetic. On such a good platform, otherwise. Chris I agree the reminder system has some shortcomings. I was frustrated recently when the assistant had all but removed entering a reminder by typing if you're in a situation where you can't use your voice. So, I wrote this app: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ccwilcox.quickreminders Its shortcuts to create Google reminders. I depend on reminders, as well Scott Scrivens That looks really useful. Incompatible with my 5X though sadly... Chris Not compatible with the 5X? I'll look into that asap and fix that... Scott Scrivens Let me know when you do, I'll give it a whirl. Chris What country are you in? Are you in the US? Currently, I have the Play Store distribution set to US only for compatibility with Google's app service Scott Scrivens Ah, that's why...I'm in the UK. Are you able to expand the distribution to here? Chris I've enabled the UK and Canada along with the US. Let me know if it works! It may have quirks but lets see! Scott Scrivens Just had a quick play with it, it's really cool! Things I would change/add (if you care to hear them): 1. Blue instead of green (I just hate lime green personally, it reminds me of too much of pre-Holo Android). Add a custom themer even if that's not loads of work. 2. Simple "Add reminder" option, without a predefined time. 3. Hitting X should close app altogether rather than just minimise. Add settings to the top of the expanded options rather than floating at the bottom. 4. Move "Remove ads option" further up out of the way. It's too prominent. 5. Key not available in my country, so add UK and Canada to that too! Those are just my two-pence, though I realise it's all subjective :) Chris Thank you for the feedback! I began building a theme option to set different colors. Many people would probably like that. I'll be happy to credit you on the app page when I post the next update. Scott Scrivens Thanks, that would be an honour. Always happy to play around with new apps. Let me know when you update. Chris I updated the app. Feel free to check it out F4LL0U7 I recently got Android Wear 2.0 on my GWR, and noticed that I don't even receive reminders on there anymore! I set all my reminders through Google Now, and last night I got a monthly reminder at 9pm on my phone. Nothing at all showed up on my watch. I navigated to the Reminders app on my watch, and the recurring reminder was in the list, but it showed zero current reminders. WTF! Seems like this might be a leftover bug from AW 1.x, where I would receive reminders right on time on my watch, but they were not actionable. If I tried marking one as done, it would think for a few seconds, and then I'd get the frowning cloud icon saying I wasn't connected. But I WAS connected, damn you Google! Josh A The app shortcuts u said Google should add on the home screen can be added to the home screen by holding on the icon again. For example, look at the pic added https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/ae1ec39a9aa7517f5e7184c8e8332418e71499a85ea1c56450445ad292f0ba61.png Scott Scrivens What I said is that the Google app should implement similar app shortcuts. Patrick O’Hara To me, the issue isn't getting reminders into the device. The issue is that there is only 1 type of reminder and it's easy to miss. There should be multiple reminder types. Silent, visual, audible, and urgent, for example. I've set lots of reminders that I never got because my volume was turned down. myssi GIVE ME REMINDER WITH DURATION!! Trip66 To find all your reminders all you have to do is say Okay Google show me my reminders and scroll the list the most recent ones are usually on top I've never had any problems finding them. Devin Quesenberry Scott, hang in there pal. You're not alone in your struggle. I've been trying to find a digital solution for my non-scheduling mind since the Trapper Keeper days. Some days I still have to carry around pen and paper, but I'm grateful for google reminders nonetheless. When Inbox came out I signed up because I liked the idea of merging my to-do list with my email (I wish Google would capitalize on this more, but it seems to me that they are starting to take the shotgun approach to development in general). However, I still find myself needing other apps like Keep and Onenote to get the job done. Reminders help me compartmentalize the many hats I have to wear between work, home, and volunteer life, so DO NOT APOLOGIZE for having reminders to do basic things like charge your phone, use the bathroom, or bathe every once in awhile. I even have reminders to check in on my mom from time to time (i.e. reminders to be a decent human being). Loved this article. Fong Yang I'm also a heavy user of reminders and I see the same problems. I hope Google fixes this soon. bekifft You're not alone, I would have written almost exactly this article if I could find the words. I've come to most of the same conclusions you have. Keep is by far the best way to handle reminders through Google, as it's the only one that lets you specify an arbitrary location at which to be reminded. The reason reminders haven't been added to Google Home yet is likely precisely because of this mess. God only knows what it looks like on the back end. Andrey Balandin You're very right in pointing out these deficiencies and I totally support that the experience is inconsistent. However, to be fair you are not using the right view in the calendar for your purposes. There is value in having one app which can show you all of the reminders created by all different methods together with other events and calendar is a good place for this, isn't it? To avoid this cluttered look which makes the calendar unusable you should just switch to schedule view. Scott Scrivens But the month view is how I use Calendar. I like to have an overview of my activity for the whole month. I don't think I should have to change my behaviour because Google is unwilling to hide upcoming recurring tasks in Calendar. YuCMi You forget that Google's business strategy is to have clones of each of their products. Rob It's worth adding that you can only add a reminder using the Google app if you have Google Now cards activated (I don't, because I find it otherwise useless).

Volvo says the first fruits of this collaboration will launch on new models within the next two years and “revolutionize how customers engage and interact with their vehicles.” The new setup will be fully integrated into Volvo’s Sensus system, and not require the user’s Android-based smartphone to be directly connected to the vehicle.  < > Fully integrated Google OS “We are making an important strategic step with the Google partnership. Google’s platform and services will enhance the user experience by enabling more personalization possibilities, while Android will offer increased flexibility from a development perspective,” said Henrik Green, Senior Vice President Research & Development at Volvo Car Group. Green noted that cars equipped with the system be able to use a host of Android apps created by Google, Volvo or third-party developers. Also: Class of 2018: The New and Redesigned Cars, Trucks and SUVs According to Patrick Brady, Vice President of Android Engineering at Google, the comprehensive integration will deliver a quicker and more seamless user experience with greater personalization for owners by expanding the selection of Android applications and Google services. In addition to things like Google Maps and Google Assistant, the system has the capability to directly command a host of vehicle functions like activating the climate control system, power windows and sunroof. Audi also has committed to a Google-integrated infotainment system. More details are expected later this week at Google I/O when operational examples of this new Google OS will be presented on a Volvo V90 Cross Country and Audi’s Q8 Sport Concept SUV. Also: Kelley Blue Book Best Buy Awards of 2017 In conjunction with the announcement, Volvo said it’s also working with Google to update the capabilities of several recent models by adding the location-based service app Google Local Search to vehicles equipped with Sensus Navigation.

Google is building full-on Android for the car with Volvo and Audi Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/15 9:33am PDTMay 15, 2017 15 Plus 1 on G+ 78 Share on Facebook 50 Share on Twitter Total Shares143 Android Auto Android OS Google News Today Google has revealed more info on their new standalone Android platform for cars. Unlike Android Auto, which just casts info from your phone onto whatever software your vehicle maker has tossed together, the new system is based on Android and brings some of the same tools Android Auto had natively. Google revealed this initiative at last year's I/O, but there hasn't been much news apart from Chrysler's concept back at CES. Both Audi and Volvo will be making use of the new systems in future vehicles. Both Volvo and Audi appear to have been given a lot of leeway with the UI in the screenshots on Google's blog, things look to be skinned pretty heavily. If Google is allowing car makers that degree of flexibility, I wouldn't expect too much in the way of material design love when it lands in more cars. Even so, more tools and features from Android making their way into your car could come in handy, OEM-skin or not. Not to mention the utility of having some of the same features you did before via Auto without needing your phone around. Google revealed last year that they were thinking about the potential of bringing full Android to cars and showed off a prototype Maserati modified to run the experimental software at last year's I/O (Maserati was not involved, Google and Qualcomm shoehorned the tech into a car on their own). Google has been quiet since then about any news related to the new initiative, or any new names for the program. Given how close this is to I/O there is a good chance we'll hear more at Google's event. Source: Google Tags Android android auto audi cars vehicles volvo subscribe ...

JD In one of the security updates it'll stop my Exhaust from exhausting outside and instead in to the cabin. Don't worry tho it goes away after a reboot and doesn't affect all models. George Google's motto: let's abandon an OS/app/service before it becomes too popular by starting from scratch with another OS/app/service... TechGuy22 LOL you're going to have a ball at this year I/0 since so many shit going to be announced that will get killed off after 6 months George bro, it's been like that EVERY year... get wit the program lol makapav It really took form last year. Spaces, Allo, Duo. That was a whole bucket list. Dennis Ulijn I have a feeling Spaces was made just because they needed some centralized message board idea for I/O. Just in time for I/O and google never looked back... Months later when another app was coming out with the Spaces name they found out it was still alive. Drakenoid Spaces was pretty good, though now we've moved to Classroom and pretty sure it won't get shuttered because schools. Ryne Hager I gotta say this here, since I can't elsewhere. But, I used to think you were just a entertaining mild troll, but given your comments elsewhere I have come to see that you are the entertaining mild troll we need. Keep it up. Kawshik Ahmed At least in this Android never had a official 'Standalone In-Vehicle Infotainment' like QNX and Tizen. There are some unofficial attemps like Hyundai uses Android 2.3 and Honda uses Android4.2 in their car IVI. But this will much safer because Google is working with them. Shining Wing So what happens when the car stops receiving updates? One of the main reasons for Auto using your phone was that you only needed to worry about your phone and app being up-to-date, and phones are a lot more replaceable than cars when the updates stop. Kawshik Ahmed Do you know Hyundai Sonata cars run on Android 2.3 !!!!!! and Honda cars run on Android 4.2 ?? People don't panic about this cars because they don't know they are running Android and not just any Android very very old version of Android but those cars are all fine. Specialized OS's don't need updates. Aaron Anything that connects to the internet needs to be updated, at least for security purposes. And these systems will have to be connected at some level for Maps updates and messages. instinct Yes, people don't care because that's the norm. However, if in 2027 you are running a car with a ten year old OS and someone else is running a current OS, people may start to care. The big problem I see right now is that Android Auto now doesn't really seem to have any aftermarket products with really good screens. Ryne Hager That is an excellent question. I hope we get more info at I/O. syxbit When I bought my last TV, I deliberately got one without Android TV, because of the pathetic updates. I just purchased a Shield. I'm happy to buy a new Shield TV every 2-3 years, but I'm expecting my TV to last 5+ years. This is exactly what I'll do with my next car purchase. I'd rather the car just support the old Android Auto, so I can keep getting new phones every 1-2 years. I will never purchase a car with Android built in unless there's a clear promise of updates for MANY years. Ryne Hager I very much agree. Wait till you see my "What we use" post. I have a feeling you're gonna love it. marcusmarcus2 How often are the infotainment systems in cars updated now? If "Project Treble" comes into fruition, then it could actually improve infotainment system updates compared to current ones. Sean Leckie XDA? :) Suyash Bansal Maybe they could use the new update mechanism they are talking about Android O which makes it easier for manufacturers to update device. h4rr4r That will never get updated. The car should just display the phone screen. Jon Fridman I was going to buy a Volvo XC60 later this year, hopefully AA integration will work better than some other cars. It won't be the new version like they're working on, but at least it'll be there. Alexey Vasilyev I have Volvo XC60 MY14 running Sensus Connected Touch (Android 2.3). UI is very fluid. But I got a lot of problems. First Volvo want 400 EUR per year to keep iGO maps updated. I made a root and installed Waze - it works very good. But 3 years have passed (not a lot for cars) and now some features are not working. For example Liveradio app (which is just a list of radio URLs) is not working anymore - server shutdown. I think the best way for such systems is to use Mirrorlink. At least you can keep apps updated. JD Wooo Now I gotta get a new car every 2 years Bru [971] That's funny. Audi was reticent to add Android Auto support to it's cars Deeco "Car has unexpectedly stopped working" icyhotmike I bought a headunit with Dual bluetooth pairing, HD, Spotify, I Heart Radio, Pandora, every damn app.. built into it... for $99 (Kenwood KMM-BT318U) It even has an "Android" mode (no idea what it does) So don't waste your money Volvo and Audi Suyash Bansal That's not Android Auto. It's Android Open Accessory protocol (AOA) that lets you control phone-based content icyhotmike I got android auto app on my phone. marcusmarcus2 This would hav ebeen good news a couple years ago when I was hoping for my Nexus Lexus...Pixel ruined that dream. boop Auto may be the only extension of Android that Google's handled well. By making it an app it's not dependent on either the car or the phone for updates, you don't even need to buy a new car or head unit as you can just run it on your phone and, working under the assumption that this is built on O with Treble, updating the car itself shouldn't even be an issue (unlike all the Android TVs stuck on Marshmallow and the Watches still waiting on Wear 2.0). Paul Lemelin Harley needs to go in this direction and I don't care if it's an Android or iOS solution because their Harmon Kardon Infotainment system is the absolute WORST! Shahin iPhone users be like, "will it also come with lag, malware and inconsistent updates?" Suyash Bansal At least it'll work better compared to Apple's Carplay 😂 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeESbGPl_Dw Harsh patil Does this mean a slow death to Android Auto from now until such OS is lanuched? JG Tesla should be involved with this. They already have a big tablet installed front and center. And, from what I heard, Tesla had approached Google in regards to potentially using Android for their system. Google informed them Android wasn't, then, ready to be used in cars. But obviously now... It would allow Tesla to quickly add more apps available. Then you could use any music streaming service, without having to wait for Tesla to build the app for their platform.

By Mike Isaac New York Times  May 15, 2017 SAN FRANCISCO — Uber sidestepped a full shutdown of its self-driving car efforts Monday when a federal judge stopped short of issuing a temporary injunction against the ride-hailing company’s autonomous vehicle program. But the court mandated that Anthony Levandowski, a star engineer leading Uber’s self-driving car program, must be restricted from working on a critical component of autonomous vehicle technology throughout the duration of the litigation, a setback that could hamper the company’s development efforts. Advertisement The decision came in a case that has underlined the increasingly bitter fight between Uber and Waymo, the self-driving car business that operates under Google’s parent company. Both companies have been striving to race ahead of each other in autonomous vehicles, which many consider to be the future of transportation. The outcome could affect who wins or loses in the technology, which has also drawn in other tech companies, automakers, and startups. The case began in February, when Waymo filed a lawsuit against Uber, accusing it of stealing trade secrets to develop self-driving cars. Waymo said the thief was Levandowski, a onetime star engineer at Google and a guru of autonomous vehicle technology, who joined Uber last year. Waymo asked the court to issue a temporary injunction that could have halted Uber’s self-driving program.

Sign up for more newsletters here Over the past few months, both sides have traded barbs with one another and attempted various legal tactics to gain the upper hand. Waymo accused Levandowski of downloading thousands of documents and using the findings at Uber. Levandowski decided to plead the Fifth Amendment in the case, reserving the right against self-incrimination. In his ruling Monday, Judge William Alsup of US District Court in San Francisco, said, “Waymo LLC has shown compelling evidence that its former star engineer, Anthony Levandowski, downloaded more than 14,000 confidential files from Waymo immediately before leaving his employment there.” He added, “Significantly, the evidence indicates that, during the acquisition, Uber likely knew or at least should have known that Levandowski had taken and retained possession of Waymo’s confidential files.” Advertisement Alsup directed Uber to produce a timeline of the events leading up to Levandowski’s hiring, including all oral and written discussions between the two parties about a key self-driving technology called LiDar — short for light detection and ranging — which Levandowski has been accused of stealing. The judge also ordered Uber to do what it could to ensure the return of the files to Waymo, including the possibility of terminating Levandowski’s employment at Uber. “Competition should be fueled by innovation in the labs and on the roads, not through unlawful actions,” Johnny Luu, a Waymo spokesman, said in a statement. “We welcome the order to prohibit Uber’s use of stolen documents containing trade secrets developed by Waymo through years of research, and to formally bar Mr. Levandowski from working on the technology.” Despite the judge’s ruling on Levandowski, Uber also had cause for celebration as its self-driving research program was not required to be put on hold, a serious blow that could have put the company behind others in the race to bring autonomous vehicles to market. “We are pleased with the court’s ruling that Uber can continue building and utilizing all of its self-driving technology, including our innovation around LiDar,” Niki Christoff, an Uber spokeswoman, said in a statement. Alsup’s ruling follows his decision Thursday to refuse Uber’s request to send the case to arbitration. The case will now move to a public trial. Alsup had also referred the case to the US attorney’s office for possible theft of trade secrets, raising the possibility of criminal charges for those involved if the Department of Justice decides to take up the case. The ruling compounds a troubled few months for Uber, which is also grappling with allegations that its workplace is ridden with sexual harassment. Travis Kalanick, Uber’s chief executive, is also under scrutiny over his leadership. And the company is facing a Justice Department inquiry into “Greyball,” a tool that Uber used to deceive authorities worldwide. Driverless cars have become increasingly contentious among tech titans. For years, Google had an advantage as an early entrant into autonomous vehicle research. The company has made strides in improving the cars’ performance through rigorous road testing in the San Francisco Bay Area. But Google has faced increasing competition. Apple has ramped up autonomous research efforts, while Uber has poured millions of dollars into bringing self-driving cars to the mainstream as quickly as possible. Automakers including General Motors and Ford have also invested in artificial intelligence startups such as Cruise Automation and Argo AI in hopes of building the software that will run self-driving cars in the future. Uber has spent the past few weeks working to minimize the impact of a ruling from Alsup against Levandowski. In a memo to his staff in April, Levandowski said he was stepping back from making decisions on LiDar technology through the duration of the company’s legal proceedings. The ruling comes a day after Waymo confirmed it had struck a deal with Lyft, the ride-hailing startup and a rival of Uber’s, to bring autonomous vehicles to consumers using Lyft’s network. Waymo’s research and technology paired with Lyft’s customer base could pose a significant threat to Uber, which has acknowledged it is behind Waymo in self-driving research. Loading comments...

Speaking through its Country Manager in Nigeria, Juliet Ehimuan-Chiazor, the company said on Friday that multiple taxes at the federal and state levels raised the cost of expanding the required infrastructure, “especially for the Internet Service Providers, which regularly complain about the issue.” She said that the private sector could play a big role in stopping multiple taxation, adding, “Where the government can help is just removing some of those obstacles; for example, bringing down the Right of Way fees and removing the challenge around multiple taxation.” Ehimuan-Chiazor had earlier said that should governments reduce the fees involved in the laying of fibre optic cables, it would encourage the development of infrastructure for the technology industry. “The reduction in fees for laying fibre optic cables will help boost the technology industry; and boosting the technology industry will help diversify Nigeria’s oil-dependent economy,” the Google country manager for Nigeria said. She added that Google had laid fibre optic cables in Kampala, Uganda’s capital, and in Abidjan in Cote d’Ivoire, but said it had no similar plans in Nigeria. The Ministry of Budget and National Planning had outlined in the country’s Economic Recovery and Growth Plan that the government would encourage local production of technology hardware to reduce dependence on imports and generate foreign exchange. According to industry experts, the plan aims to create 2.5 million new technology jobs between 2017 and 2020 via a state-run training programme. Meanwhile, in a bid to promote investment and economic development, the Association of National Accountants of Nigeria has tasked the country’s tax authorities to abolish multipletaxation. The President of the association, Sakirudeen Labode, said that multiple taxation in the country “distracts and irritates businessmen and potential investors,” adding that doing away with the practice “will bring more corporate organisations and individuals into the tax net.” He advised the government to ensure strict adherence to necessary financial regulations and standards in both the public and private sectors.

But from all indications, they are not supporting our operations. One of the governors the other time said the insurgents were better armed than our troops. Just this weekend, I was reading the rubbish Nyako was saying, accusing the military of being responsible for the killings being done by those criminals.“I don’t blame Governor Nyako for saying all that rubbish. If those governors had been suspended from office, as was the practice during the Obasanjo era; most of the problems we are facing in those states are coming from the governors there. They are contributing more to the problems we are facing. D 1 Thank you broda. well said orkah “There are two things those opposed to the state of emergency want; one of them is to score a political point, that the state of emergency was not necessary in the first place. “The message they are trying to add is that they can seek solution to the terrorism locally. Even this kidnap of the children, if you are following it up looks like a locally planned hatchet job to rubbish the work of the military and prove that they are not needed,” a top military officer said. Unquote Can this APC led Fulani people from Cameroon in Adamawa state pls give peace a chance-why always attempt to heat up then polity? ABC But why score political point with the lives of over 200 innocent young girls. Shegun Adebisi when will the core northerners go on rampage and protest against this evil rag tag islamist bigots who are holding our little girls on hostage , they will rather protest for the cartoon drawn in far island and protest against the prohibition of hi-jab in Christians established schools. ShariaHaram They will never protest because Boko-Haram is exactly what Islam stands for(terrorism). Chibok people should go to the north for their protest not in the south. They are all terrorist anyway! TeeFeeKay So every Muslim you know is a terrorist? What a pathetic thought! Brave As far as you believe in Quran you are a terrorist . dpfrank That to me is prejudice. Sharp Sharp No SW Muslims and Edo Muslims are not! Just rag head desert rats like you rubbish Brave You are a terrorist or you are clueless about what Islam is all about . Blade Am sorry to pour sand into your garri but Islam doesn’t stand for terrorism. There are good muslim people all over the world e.g. Muhammad Ali, dr oz, Hakeem Olajuwon, m.k.o abiola(rip), gani fawehimin(rip), shaquiile o’ Neal and the lists goes on and on. If Islam stands for terrorism all these ppl wud be terrorists too. It’s unfortunate that some Muslims are terrorists, however they don’t practice islam. Thanks. ABC You are either ignorant or just covering-up for your religion. The Quran commands Muslims to fight all unbelievers: Fight those who believe not in God nor the Last Day, nor hold that forbidden which hath been forbidden by God and His Apostle, nor acknowledge the religion of Truth, (even if they are) of the People of the Book, until they pay the Jizya with willing submission, and feel themselves subdued. Quran 9:29. The above emphatically exhorts Muslims to fight all non-Muslims until they convert to islam. Blade Thanks for quoting that verse. However, there is more to that verse than that. You need to read from the beginning to get the whole context. It’s too long but I wud just pick two verses to explain my point without trading insults, we don’t need that. Verse 12 says”….but if they violate their oaths after their convenant and attack your religion with disapproval and criticism THEN fight the disbelievers, for surely their words are nothing to them, so that they may stop their evil actions” Verse 73 says ” will you not fight a people who have violated their oaths and intended to expel the Messenger, while they did attack you first? Do you fear them? ……” Here is the situation then, the Arabian peninsula at that time was a Mecca of idol worshiper so who didn’t want to accept God, they were intent on killing the messenger, he had to run away from Mecca to medina. He isn’t just fighting for nutin. It’s too Guest For example centuries from now( if this world still exists lol!) ppl of that time asking why America fought the Iraq/Afghanistan wars. Historians would have to explain about 9/11 and how Americans were killed and they had to fight the terrorists ( and I accept that these terrorists are Muslims but don’t practice islam, u don’t kill innocent ppl or kill for nothing) back. I hope I have explained the meaning of the verse u quoted as best as I can. Just trying my best to make us tolerate each other. We are all one. Thanks and God bless ABC What oat are you talking about – the oat that says jews and Christian should convert to islam or accept dhimmitude status (2nd class status) under muslim rule. Why did your prophet force non-Muslims to sign agreement of conversion in the first place. Blade Nope he never forced Jews or xtians to convert to islam. They all had pledge allegiance to themselves not to fight each other. However some Jewish tribes broke their allegiance. It was mostly the idol worshippers who were Arabs that fought the Muslims and the Muslims had to fight back. The whole quran has to be read and understood, I can’t just pick bits and pieces of verses to be able to get the whole thing. No religion whether xtianity, Judaism, Islam, Buddhism, shikh etc would telli it follows to be terrorists. Blade For example centuries from now( if this world still exists lol!) ppl of that time asking why America fought the Iraq/Afghanistan wars. Historians would have to explain about 9/11 and how Americans were killed and they had to fight the terrorists ( and I accept that these terrorists are Muslims but don’t practice islam, u don’t kill innocent ppl or kill for nothing) back. I hope I have explained the meaning of the verse u quoted as best as I can. Just trying my best to make us tolerate each other. We are all one. Thanks and God bless. Have a nice day. Blade I can’t seem to reply your last message, punch is trying to moderate ur comment and am about to go to work. Yes the Prophet destroyed the idols at kabba because it was originally a place of worshipping God, the idol worshippers took over the kabba over the years. He wasn’t violent, his tribe was trying to kill him because he was spoiling business for them, people all over the Arabian peninsula used to come on pilgrimage to Mecca to worship the idols, the Meccans were making so much money. They saw him as an obstacle and plotted to kill him and so he ran away with thousands of Muslims to medina where they gladly accepted him. After 11 years ( am not sure) he returned to medina as a hero because the people of Mecca by that time had left idol worshiping and worshiping God instead. Yes there were fights, I agree but he didn’t just start tying bomb to himself and killing people anyhow. People as far China, India, maylasian, Indonesia and even South Africa are Muslims. the Prophet didn’t go and force or kill them to convert to islam. AMY You quoted out context. The verse referred to a particular situation when the Meccan pagans mobilized army from Mecca to a distance of more than 300 km to Medina to attack the Muslims. God commanded them to defend themselves. I asked a simple question. If a fight takes between Abuja and Lagos people now and the battle ground is in Gwagwalada then who is the aggressors. Is it the people of Abuja who stayed in Gwagwalada to defend themselves or the Lagos people who travelled on foots and camels covering a distance of more than 300km? The truth shall set you free. ABC The ‘good Muslims’ you listed are all ‘westernised’. Just to remind you, the late chief Gani Fawehinmi did not fight injustice with the Islamic sharia law – but with the ‘common law’, derived from a Judao-Christian value. Blade Yes u r right they r westernized, but all the same they are Muslims and read from the holy quran, pray five times daily and so on. So is Gani Fawahenin. It’s just like saying the bible teaches xtians to be gay because there are gay priests or pastors or churches that marry gay couples. That would be absolutely wrong! People chose to be what they want , they read the books of God and interpret it however they like. So we therefore, can’t generalize. I as a person say that it is only God who truly knows who is sincerely worshipping HIM. Engr Johnnie Don’t even attach the gay thing to Christians,there are more Muslims practicing it…. Blade U didn’t get my point…I said gay priests or pastor or churches that marry gay couples. I didn’t say that they practice gay relationship because it exists in both religions. However u will never find an imam of a mosque that would marry gay couples using the Quran. So pls read carefully. My point was that the Bible or xtianity doesn’t preach abt being gay so therefore I shud nt blame a religion because of what some few ppl do. And were did u get the facts that there are more Muslims that are gay? There are more gays in the western world and they happen to be predominantly xtians. So as I said earlier we can’t generalize. Only God knows how many or is more. Engr Johnnie Gotcha….. Blade Thanks alot. I appreciate ur friendly dialogue. God bless. ABC My friend, stop defending the indefensible. In Sahih muslim, your prophet said: I have been commanded to fight against people so long as they do not declare that there is no god but Allah, and he who professed it was guaranteed the protection of his property and life on my behalf except for the right affairs rest with Allah. Islam was built on violence. Blade My friend ABC. I have explained to you before that u can’t just get bits and pieces of verses and get the whole context. If u look at history…. did u read about the crusaders that started in the 11th century that killed lots of muslims in the name of religion? Should I say that because Pope Urban II in 1095 proclaimed the first crusade ( and these crusades continued for two hundreds where thousands of muslims were killed) then Christianity is built on violence? I wouldn’t only be dead wrong, I would also be commiting a sin because no religion will tell it’s follows to kill people unjustly. Yes the crusades killed many muslims and xtians but its was the xtians that started the military campaigns against the Muslim to get the Holy Land frm the muslims. Either way, killing ppl is wrong, we should all live in peace and accept each no matter the religion. ABC The crusade was carried out as a response to the Islamic jihad that muslims launched against the christiandom starting from the 7th century. It was the Muslims that first declared war against non-muslim empires ie Rome, Persian, North Africa etc. Read your history well – Islamic expansion was due to jihad. Blade You shud read ur history well. It is a well known fact that Pope Urban II at clement -ferrand in November 1085 sparked the fuel of military campaigns against muslims. If xtianity hates violence, the pope shud nt have started d crusades. Am sure Jesus Christ ( may peace be upon Him) wouldn’t have condoned those crusades either. You are allowed your views but facts will always be facts. Islam exists on far away India China maylasia and even south Africa, Zimbabwe, Muhammed Ali converted to islam….nobody forced him to. shaquile o Neal converted to islam by his own free will. Nobody forced them to. Even Micheal Jackson brother Jermaine converted too. ABC Jesus never fought or kill anyone; m0hammad slaughtered people at will. Blade True Jesus (peace be upon Him) never fought or killed anyone, Muhammed (Peace be upon Him) had to kill not because he wanted to but his people were bent on killing him to stop him from preaching about the worship of God and forbidding idol worshipping. They planned to assassinate him but they were unsuccessful. Both prophets of God were sent to two different nations, Jesus to the Jews and Muhmammed to Arabia. The Arabs are (to use a milder word) not so easy ( I don’t want to use a strong word cos it’s not good to generalize people). Muhammed preaches about peace but if absolutely he has to fight then he would. You can believe otherwise but that’s fine. Everyone is always entitled to their opinions. Only God knows best. land on point Sharp Sharp Gani may God rest his soul ! Did not see christians or Muslims he saw humanity first he was not a Muslim in the same league as these blood thirsty cowards from the north! A defender of the poor not a micro apologist like your nyako your tinubu or maximum janjaweed generalismo buhari please don’t compare apples and oranges ! Thanks Blade I am not related or a supporter of tinubu or buhari….I don’t even know nyako until I started reading abt him in the papers. I didn’t make any comment relating to them, so I don’t know why u r referencing them to me. Am just stating just as u also stated that there are good people and I made reference to Gani F. (rip) among other muslims. So pls read carefully. Thanks dpfrank I share ur view. Blade Thank you so much. I have been trying to make ppl on this forum understand that yes , there are ugly and mean people that are Muslims and commit terrible atrocities but Islam condemns such behaviors. No religion promotes violence, even atheists don’t. Unfortunately, these bad people are what ppl see in islam and that’s just bad. We should always tolerate and love each other. land Quran and Islam DOES…….. Blade Nope that’s not true. You are entitled to ur views. When all is said and done…Love and tolerance is of the most importance. people can love to hate. Hatred eats ppl up leaving no space for love. U can believe otherwise but hey…am only human. God knows best who truly serves him. Mike No religion promote violence except Islam. Action speak louder than voice. Mohamed spread Islam by violence and sword. If Muhammad had 5% of the resources and ammunitions of boko haram , he would have done worse. if boko haram are not true muslims , then muhamed too is not a true muslim, because boko haram are only following his paw prints. Blade So why are Muslims in Ghana not killing non Muslims in the name of religion, why are Muslims in South Africa, maylasia, Indonesia, Zimbabwe , not killing other people. In fact , let me come closer home, why are Muslims in Lagos, Edo, Ibadan , Abeokuta , ekiti not killing people in the name of religion if their religion promotes violence? Pls tell me why they are peaceful Muslims and not violent Muslims? Mike The answer is simple, they are yet to form a quorum. Tell me anywhere in the world where muslims constitute the majority and there is peace? Apart from the places where the non muslims have been effectively subdued under sharia. Blade Why can’t u propagate peace? How can u say ppl r yet to form a quorum? It’s like saying a child wud grow up to be evil just because one of his parents r evil or he lives in an evil environ. So Muslims in Lagos, Edo etc are yet to firm a quorum? Muslims in SW has been living in peace with their xtians neighbors for centuries, there has been no religious fight. The first and second world wars were not carried out by muslim nations…..ppl no matter what their beliefs would be evil. As an individual, i am supposed to promote love and peace and not war or terrorism. Let God be my judge. Mike Again the Muslims in yorubaland are not true muslims, they are not following the jihadik foot steps of Prophet fet Mohammed, That is why the hausas will kill them along with kaferis any day any time. Blade Mike is there anything like true xtians? It’s either u r a xtian or not. It’s up to ppl to practice Christianity the way the bible preaches. So also, there are no true or fake Muslims. Some Muslims don’t practice islam, they think they are but God forbids evil. We should all learn to tolerate and care for each other, no matter the religion. Mike Jesus did not preach gay, but Mohamed preached and practiced killing of infidels, so your analogy is mischievous. Blade Mike what does mischief have to do with anything I said. I am trying to make connection to what u said……I don’t see any connection. did I mention Jesus preached about gay? I even said xtiniaty doesn’t encourage gay relationships, I never heard about it from the bible, so what are you saying? Your own analogy is (to use your words though I don’t see a connection) is mischievous. Rotymi Gãy is a wrong example. The bible clearly prohibits marriage of same séx (homosexuality) including bestiality (séx with animals) and incest (séx with relatives like step mum, step sister, uncle, sister etc.). Just like the bible totally declares tattoo as no go area. Today some people interpret bible with a warped mind after bible have vividly declared some things. Anyway, the devil was misinterpretating the holy scriptures in order to make Jesus fall into temptation. The same way it is doing to so many men of God. Blade I think we are saying the same thing but I don’t get where we differ. What’s ur point please? AMY Whatever laws he used does not matter. The fact is that he was a muslim and fought injustice. Even the fact that he used “Judao-Christian value” to fight injustice shows that those values agree with islamic teachings. Otherwise he would not subscribe to it. ABC Islamic values: violence, terror, child marriage, women abuse. Non-muslim abuse… Engr Johnnie They don’t stand for Terrorism,they stand for Charity? Keep deceiving yourself Blade Yes islam also includes charity too. The rich is meant to give to the poor. During the month of Ramadan when we fast, we r meant to give charity. And at other times too. Unfortunately some muslims are more involved in all these terroristic behaviors Mike Don’t you know that Boko haram is an NGO? They distribute young secondary school virgins. Blade Mike that’s not funny, those are peoples daughters. Boko haram is evil and may God reveal those behind it and punish them. We shouldn’t make jokes of those helpless girls, we should all pray for their safety. They cud have been our family members. Engr Johnnie You failed to name one person from the North Blade Am not frm d north neither am I defending the North. Am just talking abt islam/muslims generally. There are muslims in Ghana too and they don’t experience all this boko haram thing. To the best of my knowledge there is peace in Ghana. The north shud hold themselves responsible for the way they practice islam. We should all tolerate each others religion and leave in peace. Brave As far as you believe in Quran you are a terrorist, because the main objective of a Muslim in Quran is to fight till death and it is the only provision that you can be sure of heaven in Islam Blade Nope the main objective is to believe in one God and to worship that one God in the correct manner. Not by killing people in the name of God. God can take care of his business. That’s what get to people to heaven. If anybody likes….let him pray all day , fast all day, do jihad or fight all day. If they don’t worship God the proper way by not performing evil, they can never ever enter paradise. D 1 My tots exactly. They just making noise. When Aba women riots happened did they do it in lagos or where they were aggrieved? senseless people ABC I wonder my brother, this is what baffles me most about these so -called moderate Muslims. orkah its APC sponsored orkah . “The message they are trying to add is that they can seek solution to the terrorism locally. Even this kidnap of the children, if you are following it up looks like a locally planned hatchet job to rubbish the work of the military and prove that they are not needed,” a top military officer said. Night Crawler The state is under state of emergency, how could they have been kidnapped without the army knowing about it, GEJ should answer those question Boma Black people with black brain HKskill Poor nation and poor brain! If Churches and Mosque needs 1 million women they will get over 3 million. I can’t blame you because you need miracle for electricity, to feed more mouth than your power, to travel, to get a job and many more This is the first demonstration in almost a month of the disappearance of those poor kids. They made you poor, they took what belongs to you and your children and now your children are missing. Nigeria, when will you be clever? If you are a woman out there and you heard why they are on the street you didn’t join them you need to think more because maybe you are the next. Logos Jacob They should go and demonstrate in Maiduguri, Sokoto and/or Abuja and not in Lagos for God’s sake. Salihu usman Big Animal ever in Nigerian history that’s you. akpakomiza Nawao dpfrank I wonder if people here thinks that every bornu indigine is a terrorist. Prejudice is evil. Made Of More… PDP produce those girlsss….. Dudu Naraya Thanks, BRF. Ever so reasonable. I look firward to meeting you one on one after your current tour of duty. My brother, you have borne your faculties so well. Drake Solo For doing what exactly? Are you drunk? Made Of More… BRF more greas to ya elbow……. A Governor indeed…… Drake Solo For doing what? You must be a first class sycophant…, lol Alfred Nwanze These girls were right where they were supposed to be. They were at school. We can’t let these insurgents get away with this otherwise our kids are not safe anywhere. Logos Jacob Many of these so-called kids are Islamo-demonic. They or their types used to hail the Boko Harams when they were burning churches in the past. Now the Muslims, adults and kids, are being attacked by their erstwhile idols and they are now feigning penitence. But are they really exhibiting penitence? Abubakar Muhammad I would like to clarify something for you to note. The area where these girls were abducted is a predominantly Christian area, that lived in Peace with their Muslim brethren. Making more than 50% of the girls were Christians. Irregardless, none of them deserve such treatment, whether Muslims or Christians. The trauma they are all going through is one that is unthinkable and unimaginable. Yet people like you stay on your computer, and make such vile statements. What would you have said if it were your sister, or daughter who was involved in this? Would you write such a comment? I wouldn’t have replied you here, but remembering the plight of the young girls makes it imperative to make this statement. Edumomoh FG ordered the closure of schools in the affected areas; now who opened the school ignoring government’s laid down security instructions? Remember that other schools in those areas were closed at time. The truth is that no school girl was kidnapped; the operation is organised by Hausa/Fulani Muslims in collaboration with APC. Immediately the school authorities and state government start giving different figures about the missing students. Even the acclaimed parents that went for ghost search in Sambisa forest with STICKS and MACHETES to release their children. I hope the story sounds so sweet, so good for kids; BED TIME STORY! Abubakar Muhammad The schools were closed. These young girls were only there writing their SSCE final papers. It was the day the finished, and were preparing to leave for their homes that the unfortunate incident occured. As for your opinion as to what the ‘TRUTH’ is, you are entitled to it, and i will not argue or try to change your mind about it. Even though we know how erroneously far from the ‘TRUTH’ it is. I would like to end by saying that these girls could have been relatives of me, you, or anyone who comments negatively on this platform, trying to overheat the polity, or relate this evil act to religious adherents. The least we can do is to pray for their safe return. My Prayer, is that God, in His Infinite Power and Omnipotence, returns these young girls back to their families and loved ones. It’s the least we can do, instead of making such unconfirmed and unfounded statements. D 1 Tell ur fellow mallams to do the needfull. What has Fashola got to do with the abductions? Isnt there a governor in Brono state? When the Aba women riot took place was it in lagos? U see a round hole and u want to put in a square peg. I am sorry for the girls but why now? when 30 plus were abducted last year what did u people say? they all came back pregnant and the matter was swept under the rug.. Hypocrites. trouble Why have the muslims in the north not gone on riots & rampage the way they do for things that dont affe ct their lives. Or did mohammed tell them it is ok to abduct young girls.all the immas that usually incite the riots what happened to them.? There is something going on we are not aware of. trouble I hope we are aware that a period of about 3 weeks have elapesed since this abduction. We dont expect that the 200 girls are all still held in one place. While we were busy talking & making noise as usual this girls have probably been distributed to several places by now as spoils of war. nigerians wake up! 9ja Wisdom Yes! Fashola can help by begging the owner of Lagos State Tinubu to stop sponsoring Boko Haram with finance. Immediately finance is cut off from Boko Haram, they will not be able to pay new recruits nor buy more arms for their killing spree. Fashola help us beg your master. prof.truth Those who make careless talk should expect nothing less what befell the girls. Its disturbing to see how dehumanizing some statements are…. Night Crawler This Government never fails to impress us with how clueless and confused they are. Instead of finding the missing girls, they are blaming others for their failures. Makes one wonder “Who is leading this Country?”. This clueless government always shift blame on opposition for all their failures instead of confronting them, while they are in control of all security forces in the country. As citizens it is our responsibility to ask the questions which have been on the lips and on the minds of millions around the world. 1. Why has more protection for our children in schools in the N.E not been provided even after the devastation and pain of the 59 innocent children murdered in FGC BuniYadi on February 25 2014? 2. How is it possible in the age of drones and Google Maps and aerial shots that over 200 girls will vanish without a trace? 3. How is it possible that in places where there is a state of emergency 4 trucks and numerous motor bikes can move around in convoy – undetected by the military – into the school at Chibok and then out of the school and to a location unknown? 4. Why, despite the massive increase in federal military spending, Nigerians not safer than they were a few years ago? Why despite these huge amounts do we keep hearing that our heroic soldiers are under equipped and under prepared to face the terrorists. Nigerians need answers!!!!!

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 16 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman SelahSoftware Launches Two New Exciting Google Drive Scripts The two Google Drive Scripts help to organize files as well as deal with the problems of shared Google Drive Files and Folders. Google Drive can be an important productivity tool for the business sector. However, once the drive is used on a regular basis by several employees, it can cause major problems and become problematic when trying to keep everything organized. To solve that problem a leading software company called SelahSoftware has launched two Google Drive scripts. SelahSoftware.com’s new Google Drive Scripts have become an important step in helping to reduce time and clutter when using Google Drive. The first script deals with one of the big problems when using Google Drive, specifically that files can accumulate on the front page. The more files, the more time spent in organizing files into folders. If the user’s files follow a naming pattern, this script can automatically move files into the specified folders. The second script deals with the problems that shared Google Drive files and folders can cause, which includes the loss of files. When a person receives a shared file due to them not having ownership of that file, it can be deleted without their knowledge; this can be very problematic when needing that file. To combat the loss of files is a timely process especially if there are lots of different files on the drive. To avoid losing a file and to gain ownership a person will have to download the file and then upload it again to the drive. The new script from SelahSoftware deals with that problem and automates the process saving time and money. Any user can implement these scripts without any programming experience required.  Most users will be able to set these up in 10 minutes or less. The scripts have gained worldwide exposure for helping businesses save time and money and avoid the problems that Google Drives can cause. For a limited time only and to celebrate the success of the Google Drive scripts, SelahSoftware.com is offering both scripts at just $20 each. The scripts come with a 30-day money back guarantee. Through July there is an extra 10% off by using the coupon code MT9E3KJG at checkout.

ROS LBoard 1 Hadi’s bill: Suhakam warns of treaty violations FMT Reporters Read More FMT BAHASA FMT BORNEO+ FMT VIDEO CONTRIBUTE NEWS HOME NATION OPINION WORLD LEISURE SPORTS BUSINESS ADVERTISE WITH US North Korea link emerges in global cyberattacks AFP | May 16, 2017 Google researcher Neel Mehta posted computer code that showed similarities between the "WannaCry" malware and a vast hacking effort widely attributed to Pyongyang. WASHINGTON: Security researchers on Monday reported signs of a potential North Korea link to the massive cyberattack campaign that sparked havoc in computer systems worldwide and opened fresh political rifts between Russia and the United States. After days of disruptions affecting networks worldwide, a top US official said the number of computers affected had reached 300,000, but that infection rates had slowed. In the first clues of the origin of the massive ransomware attacks, Google researcher Neel Mehta posted computer code that showed similarities between the “WannaCry” malware and a vast hacking effort widely attributed to Pyongyang. Other experts quickly jumped on this as a sign — although an inconclusive one — that North Korea may have been behind the outbreak. “We believe this might hold the key to solve some of the mysteries around this attack,” said researchers at the Russian-based security firm Kaspersky, adding that further research was needed. Israeli-based security firm Intezer Labs said it agreed with the North Korea attribution. The group’s chief executive Itai Tevet said in a tweet: “@IntezerLabs confirms attribution to North Korea for #WannaCry, not only because of the function from Lazarus. More info to come.” US, Russia trade jabs Tom Bossert, President Donald Trump’s top cyber and homeland security adviser, brushed aside suggestions that the United States was to blame for the attack, which stemmed from a flaw discovered by the US National Security Agency and later leaked. “This was not a tool developed by the NSA to hold ransom data,” he said, noting that no US government systems had been hit. “This is a global attack,” he added. Russian President Vladimir Putin earlier had pointed the finger at the United States. “A genie let out of a bottle of this kind, especially created by secret services, can then cause damage to its authors and creators,” the Russian leader said on the sidelines of a summit in Beijing. Russia has recently been accused of cyber meddling in several countries, but Putin said they had nothing to do with the attack. Over the weekend, Microsoft’s president and chief legal officer Brad Smith said attacks highlighted the dangers from the NSA’s “stockpiling” of secret hacking tools. There had been concern that Monday’s start of the working week would see an upsurge in attacks. But the cross-border police agency Europol said the situation was “stable” after attacks that struck computers in British hospital wards, European car factories and Russian banks. “The number of victims appears not to have gone up,” a senior spokesman for Europol, Jan Op Gen Oorth, told AFP. But according to Michel Van Den Berghe, director of telecom group Orange’s cyber security arm, a “second wave” is to be expected. Telecoms and carmaking hit US package delivery giant FedEx, Spanish telecoms giant Telefonica and Germany’s Deutsche Bahn rail network were among those hit. The attackers demanded money to unblock their computers. In China, “hundreds of thousands” of computers were affected, including gas stations, cash machines and universities, according to Qihoo 360, one of the country’s largest providers of antivirus software. Russia said its banking and railway systems were targeted. A fifth of regional hospital associations in Britain’s National Health Service were affected and several still had to cancel appointments on Monday. French carmaker Renault shut its Douai plant — one of its biggest sites, employing 5,500 people — as systems were upgraded. The attack blocks computers and puts up images on victims’ screens demanding payment of $300 (275 euros) in the virtual currency Bitcoin, saying: “Ooops, your files have been encrypted!” Bossert said that paying the ransom provided no guarantee files would be unlocked. He told a news conference that “it appears that less than $70,000 has been paid in ransoms and we are not aware of payments that have led to any data recovery.” Bitcoin, the world’s most-used virtual currency, allows anonymous transactions via heavily encrypted codes. Experts and governments alike warn against ceding to the demands and few victims so far had been paying up. A hacking group called Shadow Brokers released the malware in April, claiming to have discovered the flaw from the NSA. The attack is unique, according to Europol, because it combines ransomware with a worm function, meaning once one machine is infected, the entire internal network is scanned and other vulnerable machines are infected. Although the economic fallout is still unknown, the political fallout “will be significant” according to the Eurasia consultancy. In addition to Russia, China and India have blamed the US government for developing the original code. Comments Readers are required to have a valid Facebook account to comment on this story.

Forums Join   Tucows/Ting CEO Downplays Impact of Google Fiber Pivot by Karl Bode Monday May 15 2017 18:00 EDT Tucows CEO Elliot Noss, whose subsidiary Ting is slowly building out fiber to a small number of markets, this week attempted to downplay the impact Google Fiber's pivot will have on the US fiber broadband market. Google Fiber has been shedding executives and annoying waiting customers after freezing its fiber expansions last fall in order to contemplate a shift to wireless. And while large ISPs have been celebrating the derailing of additional competition, Google Fiber still hopes to use wireless to disrupt the market. Speaking on the company's recent earnings call, Noss tried hard to downplay the impact Google Fiber's sudden personality change will have on the market. "There are certainly markets that had, had some conversation with Google who have been in contact with us," said Noss. "But at the end of the day, it's such a big market, and Google had such big halo that I don't know that will necessarily have a material impact." It's kind of hard to argue that Google Fiber pivoting to wireless won't have a "material impact" on fiber deployments overall, though keep in mind Noss was trying to ease the worries of investors. That said, despite half a decade at work, Noss is correct that Google Fiber's actual impact is not in sync with the hype the project received, with estimates suggesting Google Fiber has around 1 million broadband subscribers -- but just 85,000 or so TV subscribers. That said, Noss didn't necessarily say Google Fiber's pivot would be good for the sector, either. He did, however, express hope that other companies would try to copy the efforts Tucows and Google Fiber have made to disrupt the laregly uncompetitive broadband sector. "It's not, in any way, like 'Boy, we're pleased that Google Fiber is limited now to the 11 markets they're in and not expanding further,'" Noss said. "We really believe that in the case of fiber to the home, a high tide raises all boats and we would love to see more players in the space, not less." tags: Fiber · competition · business · alternatives · bandwidth · consumers · Google Fiber · gigabit · Ting News Jump »Tucows/Ting CEO Downplays Impact of Google Fiber PivotStudy: 97% of Comments to the FCC Are Pro-Net NeutralitySprint to Launch Gigabit LTE in New Orleans This YearMore Than Half of Cord Cutters Did So In Just Last Two YearsForum Topic: The Ongoing Global Ransomware AttackNetflix Blocks Rooted Phones From Seeing Netflix AppMonday Morning LinksComcast Preps Skinny Bundle, Compares Itself to AppleSprint, T-Mobile Begin Merger TalksA Closer Look at Super WiFi----------------------this weeklast weekmost discussed Forums → Tucows/Ting CEO Downplays Impact of Google Fiber Pivot view: topics flat nest  iansltx join:2007-02-19 Austin, TX iansltx Member Yesterday 6:38 pm Who cares about TV subscriber counts? We've already established that cord cutting is a thing, and my guess is that folks who are likely to use GFiber are also much more likely to go OTT with their TV stuff. Particularly given that GFiber won't sell you TV without internet (whereas cable companies will). Didn't realize GFiber was up to 1MM customers on the 'net side. That's a success story as far as I'm concerned. Probably the largest gigabit consumer population by far, though certainly not the majority of gigabit customers these days, thanks to bunches of small providers hopping on the bandwagon...plus FiOS now (finally).

AT&T and Verizon are making investments where people are moving, and letting copper rot in the areas people are leaving behind. This purposeful neglect exacerbates the problem, but there isn't much of a remedy for this. FTTH deployment isn't nearly at the pace that DSLR readers would like to see, but I feel that things are slowly getting better year over year.

It is reasonable to have way more than that. With ATT raising their minimum internet tier from $32 to $55 a month, there is zero reason for someone to not switch to Gfiber if it is in their area. If Cable, dsl, and fiber all costs the same then switching is a no brainer.

One difference, is the wireless carriers have NEVER stopped investing in buying new frequency allocations or their own infrastructure upgrades 2g, evdo, 3g, 4g/lte, etc at the cell sites. What has been lacking is the back-haul which is the fiber infrastructure which is badly needed. The on again, off again dance between Comcast and Verizon proves there is still dysfunction in the marketplace. If google wants to make a run at wireless, go ahead.. but the BS way they've been going about it is beyond pathetic (googlefi). Make up your damned mind already.

But also if there is enough consolidation in the industry in the near future that carriers feel ok with getting rid of mvnos then ting is really screwed.

Credit: Adrees Latif/Reuters More than a thousand miles of harsh, mountainous terrain separates Pakistan and Afghanistan. The border is notoriously porous and difficult to enforce, as invading armies have learned — and it’s been a source of contention between the two governments for decades. Player utilities Popout Share download Listen to the Story. PRI.org <iframe frameborder="0"  src="https://www.pri.org/node/168697/embedded" height="75" width="100%"></iframe> The “Durand Line” establishing the border was drawn in the 1890s, by British representatives from Afghanistan and what was then British India. It split the land of ethnic Pashtuns nearly in half. Pakistan inherited the border when it gained independence in 1947, but Afghanistan has never officially recognized it. Pashtuns living on either side of the border traditionally haven’t paid it much attention — they often have more in common with each other than with their respective countries. Things remain tense in the disputed border area, however. Fighting broke out again recently when a Pakistani census group accompanied by soldiers visited villages there, and at least eight civilians were killed. But officials in Pakistan and Afghanistan are signaling that they may be ready for détente. Both sides have agreed to a thoroughly modern solution: using Google Maps and GPS to conduct a geological survey and settle the border issue for good. The process is likely to mirror the original marking of the Durand Line. Back then, representatives pored over maps to negotiate a route before walking it, hammering posts into the ground every few miles. Now, officials from both countries “can walk that border with the GPS, and they can create the digital equivalent of those border posts that they originally marked over 100 years ago,” said Steven Feldman, a digital mapping consultant based in London. The “digital posts” can then be turned into the countries’ borders on Google Maps. But, Feldman said, the technology is just a tool — Pakistan and Afghanistan first have to agree where that border is. “I’m not certain that Google Maps is the answer to their problems.” The 1,510 mile border between Pakistan and Afghanistan is known as the "Durand Line."  Credit: Google Maps reflect political realities, and Google has what Steven Feldman calls a “hierarchy of rules” when it depicts countries. Most borders are widely acknowledged by the international community, and Google denotes these on its maps with a solid line. For disputed places like Palestine, Kashmir, or Crimea, it gets a little more complicated. Google tries to defer to the judgment of international bodies, and it marks contested borders with dotted lines. But the Google map you see can be entirely different depending on where you’re viewing it from. That’s because Google must follow the laws of countries it operates in. The Crimean Peninsula was controlled by Ukraine until Russia invaded in 2014. In Russia, according to the law, Crimea is shown to be part of the country with a solid black line. But in Ukraine and most of the world, Google Maps demarcates Crimea with a dotted line. Google Maps is a private company, Feldman said, and shouldn’t be called upon to arbitrate clashes on the international stage. “It's only states that can bring about dialogue and compromise.” Yet Google is now the largest mapmaker in the world, and as a result, it frequently gets sucked into geopolitics, willingly or not. “I guess, naively perhaps, we hoped we could have one global map of the world that everyone used, but politics is complicated,” Ed Parsons, Google’s geospatial technologist, told The Independent. Google did not immediately respond to The World's request for comment.  The company has been the target of social media campaigns and petitions for not drawing a solid line around Palestine, and sometimes the stakes have been even higher: In 2010, when Google data mistakenly gave a chunk of Costa Rica to Nicaragua, troops were deployed on both sides before the map could be fixed.

Google will announce Assistant for iOS soon, in the US only at launch David Ruddock Follow View All Posts 2017/05/15 7:28am PDTMay 15, 2017 101 Plus 1 on G+ 217 Share on Facebook 140 Share on Twitter Total Shares458 Applications Exclusives News Rumors According to a trusted source, Google plans to announce that the Google Assistant will be launching on iOS soon as a standalone app. The announcement could come as soon as Google's I/O conference this week, but it's unclear exactly what Google's plans are at this time. The app would likely feature a blend of the "chat" style functionality in the Google Allo version of Assistant and the voice-controlled version found on Android, but again, details are scant. We do know that the Assistant for iOS will only be available in the US at launch, and that Google plans to make the announcement in fairly short order. I/O would be a pretty ideal venue for such a launch, as Assistant's SDK was just made available to developers late last month. Bringing the Assistant to the world's second-largest mobile OS would likely encourage more developers to integrate with the app's functionality. As we learn more about this story, we'll bring it to you. For now, just know that Assistant on iOS is imminent. While we are labeling this story a "rumor" because we don't know what Google's exact timeframe for announcing this news is, we're highly confident that the information we were provided is accurate.

Martin You are wrong. Beta is on Android. We test it, then they release it better working on iOS... We keep testing... :-)) Bewear Sad, but true. JD Correction. Google services is always beta. When something is about to Go Gold they shut it down and offer 3 competing products. Because Fuck you that's why. - Google. Filipe Santos You won! King_Android Naw, iOS users would have the first Alpha version of GA while we wait for the rollout to hit our Android devices. Maxwell “Max” Weinbach I have had it for months. S7 Edge and Nexus 6P ADofCLE He's referring to the typical release of Google services. He was being sarcastic. rohiggidy google now/voice search is on IOS. We all expected this MaximumFish "In the US only at launch". Isn't that *still* the case for the Android version? No-one I know if the UK has got it yet, except Pixel users obviously. I've given up checking for it now. Winston Indonesian here. ALL of my devices have it. Since 2 months ago or so. krazyfrog Got it from the day they announced. You probably just need to clear your Google Play services cache or change device language to English US. Alex Yes, I believe that changing the device language to "English US" works, but that's pretty much stating that it's still US only, as you have to pretend to be from US. Shahin Just adding it as a second option works, provided you setup Assistant with US only first. That way you don't have to deal with US Englizh. MaximumFish Thinking about it, I get the sneaky suspicion that I don't have it due to having a Google Apps account. I wish they'd offer a route to migrate from Apps to a standard account. Hyperionite Indonesian here. Using English US as my default language. My device have it. Running Android 6 at the moment Latheryin Won't mean much as Apple will still leverage the use of its own over Google. Heck most android users don't use it what makes them think iPhone users will. Martin Because Google are dumb ducks... I use it, but would use it a lot more, if they make it again to Wake up the assistant from the lock screen on any device... Miss so much from my iPhone being able to say "Hey Siri" and set alarm/timer/call even without touching my phone... And not everyone wants to use Pixel phones... :) David Slawotsky Use Trusted Voice in Settings. That will allow you. Martin I guess this is only for Pixel phones. I don't have this in my settings :) Alex Trusted Voice is part of Google's Smart Lock -- it's not just for Pixel. On my stock Galaxy S7, it's under Settings > Lock screen and security > Secure lock settings > Smart Lock Latheryin To be honest I have it on my nexus and never use. It just not something I need. Let alone want to broadcast what I am doing to every one around me. It is almost as bad as people talking on speaker phone in public. Martin It's personal thing. Some will use it, some wont.. :-)) Latheryin I, see a lot less people wanting to use it on IOS. Won't be enough integration when compared. To siri. To be honest they should just keep the AI on the platform they were made for. We all saw how Apple music did on Android. AbbyZFresh Your point. Apple has Siri and Spotlight embedded in their phone and yet the Google search app is one of the most downloaded in the App Store. Latheryin Those numbers seldom mean real downloads and use. Things like download counts and reviews are seldom accurate with places selling downloads and reviews for really cheap Leandro Brandão I wish I could replace Siri with google assistant. Julie Ankrom I don't want either one. I just want "OK google" and doing a search directly, or giving orders directly. I played with Google Assistant for a while and it just adds a middleman. Leandro Brandão I never used assistant, I thought it was a better ok google. Google app always understands me and give me correct answers. JD If anything it's a worse Google Now. but it speaks more naturally? So I guess that's a good thing? I don't even fucking know anymore. OligarchyAmbulance Assistant is activated with "Ok, Google" and does what you are asking for. In what way is it worse or a "middle man" to Google Now (which it replaced)? destinyhud right when i am trying to replace my ipad with Chromebook detachable. i have hopes for Chromebook C2 at IO SupahNin10doh Thank bliming bob! I hate Siri sooo much. SupahNin10doh Now if they'd also bring it to MacOS Ghostx7x And then to Windows 10 Leonardo Baez Soooo I'm on Nexus 6P and have no assistant yet, but iphone is getting it? Outrageous Cat Astrophy http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/03/02/google-assistant-coming-android-6-0-devices/ If your phone doesn't have it blame your cell provider, not Google. Filipe Santos You have if you choose the supported languages, otherwise no. I changed but if you have your second language, your native language messages will be spoken so damn bad you can't understand or speak sh*t RickJ How does Google expect anyone to want switch from​ iPhone to their phone when they​ keep giving everything away to Apple for free? Keep some things to yourself, Google! Some exclusive incentives for them to switch. Adam Margeson Google doesn't care about switching people to Android. They only care about getting customer data. They can sort-of do that if they keep getting their apps over to iOS. And then provide subtle hints that "Android integrates all of this to make things easier... if you care to switch over." (Not to say that they do integrate things better... just look at the Assistant-on-different-devices fiasco) lauski I'd agree they don't care AS MUCH, but they do care to some degree... Look, they officially have entered the hardware business with the pixels. Right now you're right-- whatever sales they might marginalize are far outweighed by marketing dollars and customer info. The opposite is true for Apple, which is why we won't be enjoying an official iMessage and Facetime release on the Play Store any time soon... Zach Mauch I might at the "[Exclusive]" to this just so i is obvious that it is info from AP. Artem Russakovskii "I might at the "[Exclusive]" to this just so i is obvious that it is info from AP." A little attention when typing? Régis Knechtel https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/b02bffe886fcaf1c5490199c0b7fa03f201960050d66218052c281973c4f9283.gif ADofCLE I knew this was coming. They always release their products on iOS. Even though it really doesn't do anything Google Now already does. Cakefish I haven't even got it on my non-Pixel UK Android phone yet. DragoCubed Surprised yet not surprised they did this. I just wished they'd keep some more android exclusives. Nicholas C YES! I am 95% google here but have an iPhone after the whole Note7 shitstorm JD Too bad you still can't use a default assistant other than Siri. I would totally use Google Now if I could. Fucking Hate Siri that useless hunk of code. Filipe Santos Google stop being an a$$hole, why the hell you release an iOS app if you don't even release on the rest of the languages first or countries? Do you only care about profit? Damn ****** ..... jawsnnn Off topic... It was reported months ago that GA was rolling out to Nexus devices. Is that still happening? Does anyone know? Dave Cremin Lol and I haven't even got it in my 6P. Ridiculous. Brad Wilson I put the Google app on my home screen, because it's so much better than Siri. It's worth the extra step to press the button. I hope that Google assistant becomes better than what I'm using now. Premsuraj Can someone explain to me why the Voice Actions on Google Now can work with a lot of languages including hotword support, but Google Assistant only works with US & UK English? Shouldn't the voice detection be a separate component that can work with any voice assistant? Or atleast they should be able to easily reuse the current implementation Teja I got Assistant on my Oneplus 3 few weeks back, I resetted my device few days back and its gone. Its been 5 days and I'm still waiting to see it. Can anyone help? mike shwilly Ok Google, what is this song?

PSA: Google Is Apparently Deleting Old, Unused Accounts Without Warning—Time To Back Up Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2015/07/29 12:07pm PDTJul 29, 2015 417 Plus 1 on G+ 113 Share on Facebook 117 Share on Twitter Total Shares530 Google News Users are reporting that Google has started slashing and burning old accounts in recent days, seemingly with no warning. The first sign something is wrong comes in the form of an alert sent to the user's backup email informing them their Google account has been deleted because of an unresolved terms of service violation. Whatever is going on, it's probably time to backup any unused accounts you have sitting around. The Gmail support forums are packed with users reporting their old accounts have been nuked, and several Reddit threads have popped up in the last few days as well. Most affected users say the deleted accounts hadn't been used in a long time, possibly years. It's unlikely an inactive account could violate Google's terms of service. Even though the email claims users can restore the accounts if they act quickly, everyone is reporting that the deleted accounts are irrecoverable. Google hasn't responded to requests from the support moderators, but I'd wager this is at least partially a mistake. It wouldn't be surprising if Google clears out free accounts that haven't been touched in years, but the ToS email and immediate deletion doesn't seem correct. A message that explains the situation and gives users a chance to stop the removal of their account would be a better approach. We don't know what's going on yet. Maybe the deletions are supposed to be happening, but the alerts aren't being sent correctly. It's also possible this is just one big screw up and Google didn't intend to vaporize these accounts. In which case, yikes. We haven't seen anyone claiming their active account was deleted in this fashion, but still, you should always have a backup from Google Takeout. If you've got an old account that has something important on it, definitely save a copy locally. Source: Reddit, Reddit 2, Gmail Support Tags accounts backup Google google takeout subscribe ...

Garrett Nothing worse than seeing the username you really want has been sitting inactive for 6 years. chromaniac Google does not recycle Gmail IDs to the best of my knowledge. Thomas Ella Yeah, I'd have to imagine they're doing it to free up server space, and probably to get a more accurate count of active accounts for their advertisers. unhappybirthday In my experience, accounts shut down for disuse do not have the username released to the pool for reuse. It is off limits "forever". Fabrice Thomas An email address used once will never be available again in the future: https://support.google.com/mail/answer/61177?hl=en Andy Roid Then what's the point of pruning them? Fabrice Thomas An account is not an email address only, many things are remove from servers doing this so, I'd reply: cleaning and better stats. BTW, all of this (what happen to inactive account) can be set up there: https://www.google.com/settings/account/inactive Steve 1. Cleaning space 2. Report correct "active" users to advertisers Andy Roid Cleaning space? They host YouTube which has days worth of HD video being uploaded every minute. They are not short on storage space iCON You can report the account to Twitter and when you're lucky they will delete it. They did this in my case. SuperMarkert They will only do this if the Twitter account is (a) abusive or (b) clearly trying to impersonate something/someone (or a related copyright issue). They will not release a Twitter account simply because it's not being used. iCON You read my comment? Good, because I clearly wrote, that Twitter does exactly that. Sukigu Where did you do it? This page seems to indicate they don't do that. jab416171 Except Google doesn't actually release the gmail usernames. Shahmi This is really great. I may have finally able to create an account with the id that I have always wanted! But I hope I can transfer purchases, contacts etc to a new account though NunjaBusiness Nope. Never been an option and I doubt it will. brkshr Can't transfer purchases. If we could, I would have 1 less email to set up on my phone. Suicide_Note Google doesn't allow usernames to be recycled. m-p{3} Scary, especially if there's paid content on the account like Android apps, or a Google Drive subscription. Michael In that case I would assume they shouldn't be marked as inactive accounts. zzzzz a lot of people buy Drive subscription and never use it again ? sproc Interesting. Microsoft already deleted my old useless Hotmail accounts, so I don't care. Why warn them? What's the point, they've abandoned the account years ago. And with spam controls I don't need a trash account. catalysto I wonder if they consider an account inactive if you simply have all your email forwarded from it to another address. Because a lot of people do that. MooseCat This is exactly the case for two of my email accounts. I lost the password for those accounts and it's basically impossible to recover anything going through gmail's system. Everything is set up to forward to my main account so it didn't matter but if I lose these, I'm going to have to snag them back asap when they're back on the market. -_- Cool I don't think Google releases previously used email ids back into the pool. That's to prevent account hijacking. I'm not a hundred percent sure if that's the case. But I'm relatively certain. Suicide_Note Google doesn't allow usernames to be used again. Once it's off the market, it's off forever. David Williams One problem is account hijacking. It might be that you've used the email address for a particular service like Facebook or Amazon. If your email account is deleted and someone else can sign up for it, then they could use that to get into your accounts. Often these accounts are a gateway to other things like physical addresses and payment information. Microsoft Accounts are actually quite a good example of where this problem has already been managed. Microsoft made a change so that any Hotmail/Outlook.com account linked to an Xbox Live account won't expire. Nick Coad In the real world, where we actually live, how likely do you honestly think it is that someone will a) somehow find out the email address you used for Facebook, b) also know that the email address has been completely inactive for > 9 months, c) will also know that the email address has been deleted? Kiryn Silverwing They wouldn't need to know it's yours specifically, but in a world where emails were recycled like this, people could just generate new emails en masse, then pop them into the password recovery of major websites to see if any of them have been used before. Nick Coad That would not be worth any hackers time, when there are much more successful attack vectors for them to busy themselves with. Dyan_Branielson So Google will finally make it possible for me to snatch the old, unused, inactive or possibly deleted Gmail addresses with the IDs I always wanted but couldn't use because they were already taken, right? Right?! Guys?! iCON No, this is for privacy and security reasons (that you can not use an old, deleted name). Dyan_Branielson I know. (Other hosts are still making it possible though. But I respect Googles decision.) Fatal1ty_93_RUS Huh, well thankfully my accounts aren't that old and I login into them from time to time, so no worries there. Hopefully someone755 What exactly defines an inactive account? I have an account I've only ever looked at on my phone -- the emails I get are important to me, but I don't interact past reading them. Me not active... so, no login or email. you have an active account. someone755 So technically even if I never touched it and continued to get email, it would classify as an active account? Alan S My understanding is that if you haven't logged into the account in X days then it is deemed inactive and therefore deleted regardless if there is email coming through. letsplaay My guess is: your phone is linked and you turn it on: active. KojiroAK When you have set up your Google Account on your Android as long as the device is active and has internet connection -> logged in -> active The same for Chrome. Also any other software that connects to your Google Account (like any sort of mail program with your account data setup) someone755 Thanks for clearing that up! Nick Coad Everytime you check your email you're "accessing" the account, that means it's active. Greg Miernicki Doesn't look like a significant # of accounts have been deleted yet... http://plus.miernicki.com/ But, the ToS used to say 9 months of inactivity and your account will be vaporized. Cool Hmm. Checked my seldom used accounts and they were fully functional. I guess as long as I log into them intermittently everything should be fine. But I have definitely gone over a year without checking them before, without issue. NunjaBusiness Thanks for the "head's up" and a pointer to Google Takeout. But ... where the hell is the "backup" feature you allude to? KojiroAK It is Takeout, Takeout allows for a local backup of online data. What did you expect? JD Great, there goes my plan of leaving my great grand kids a Treasury hunt based on cryptic emails and documents in my G drive. Manguas You can do it by using Inactive Account Manager. https://www.google.com/settings/account/inactive JD The timeout only goes up to 18 months. Also I'll likely be long dead before they sign up for accounts so I can authorize them. Great grandkids remember? Wait unless you mean Google knows how to make us live forever but haven't released it. Andy Roid I got a sweet Yahoo ID when they started pruning unused accounts a year or so ago. This is long overdue. If people haven;t used the account for years there's no reason for them to hold on to it. Andy Roid Gmail Terms of Service used to say: "Account Inactivity Google may terminate your account in accordance with the terms of service if you fail to login to your account for a period of nine months." Now it says "We believe that you own your data and preserving your access to such data is important. If we discontinue a Service, where reasonably possible, we will give you reasonable advance notice and a chance to get information out of that Service." Justtyn Hutcheson They aren't discontinuing a Service (i.e. Google Reader), they are purging an inactive account. Big difference. ADofCLE The first part says if inactive for 9 months or more, Google can delete the account. Nick Coad Yes, and the second part talks about discontinuing a service, not an account. What's your point? ADofCLE That they state that they'll can and will delete the account. That's my point. Nick Coad No one said otherwise, who are you even talking to? Suicide_Note Discontinuing a service would be if they completely shut down Gmail or Drive, for example. Scott Wilson What's more likely is this has happened one or two times, and the neckbeards at reddit are making it sound like a worldwide epidemic like they do with everything. Eric Jones I wonder if that applies to email accounts that I don't ever log into, because they are forwarded to another account. I guess I should do the rounds, and physically log into each of them. Suicide_Note If there's been no login for nine months, then your account is eligible to be deleted. -Matoro Zeliph- I don't see this as a problem for the majority of us. Since we're always connected with Google where ever we go. The only point I could see this as a problem is... - A family member passes away. You can't get on their Google account to see their treasured secrets and memories. (Need to contact and convince google somehow you were related to this family member). - After a (2+ year) Zombie Apocalypse - What happens after $h1ts got settled and you want to resume to your daily internet life (assuming you survive) and realized google deleted your account? robbo No, if i die I don't want anyone getting into my account and "secrets" as you say. The worse thing that I want people to be upset about is me dying. The hell with them looking through that stuff. -Matoro Zeliph- lol! If I die, I don't care if my family members takes a look at my Google Account. I wouldn't be alive to bother anyway. Sir_Brizz Same. I wish Google would set up an easy way to transfer account ownership in the case of death. ePoch 270 Just give your next of kin your password. That's what my dad did before he passed. Now I manage it. Not that I use it much. I just use his contacts to forward emails to his family and friends Nick Coad Or just use the tool provided instead of sharing your password? kspace They do one better, which is allow you to designate someone to have access your data without handing the entire account over (which would allow them to impersonate you) https://www.google.com/settings/account/inactive Sir_Brizz Woah, cool. I have never seen that before. Thanks. RyanPrad Out with the old. Guest Making room for everybody uploading to their unlimited Photos quota... Kristian Ivanov Here's a quick question - is the Google account backup file usable in some way by a 3rd part app or something? I mean if I back it up, can I use it offline if the account gets deleted? rap Good reminder to sign in to some accounts that I hadn't used for a long time. One for a child's kindle and the other an inactive one used for business that might want in the future. DarkUFO They are only deleting accounts that have had Terms of Service violations that have been unresolved for 18 Months. Dylan Swirkowski Here's the thing... Most Google accounts are provided for no out of pocket cost to the consumer. As the consumer you pay Google by using the services they offer and supporting minimal advertisements that Google publishes. If Google wants to delete your old unused account they should be able to. If you're not using it why should it hurt you too much? After all Google is the owner and you're just another user on the platform on which they already have thousands of other active users.

Netflix confirms it is blocking rooted/unlocked devices, app itself is still working (for now) Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/13 3:08pm PDTMay 13, 2017 229 Plus 1 on G+ 1077 Share on Facebook 394 Share on Twitter Total Shares1700 Applications News Earlier today, Netflix started showing up as 'incompatible' on the Play Store for rooted and unlocked Android devices. However, the app itself continued to work fine, leading some (including myself) to think it could have been an accident. However, Netflix has now confirmed to us that blocking modified devices from downloading the app was intentional. This is the full statement: With our latest 5.0 release, we now fully rely on the Widevine DRM provided by Google; therefore, many devices that are not Google-certified or have been altered will no longer work with our latest app and those users will no longer see the Netflix app in the Play Store. If you're not familiar with it, Widevine is a Google-made DRM technology that works across various desktop and mobile platforms. Widevine categorizes devices into three security levels, ranging from all processes running in the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) to not running anything in TEE at all. However, the Play Store listing seems tied to a device's SaftetyNet status (which is used by Android Pay), rather than the Widevine TEE. For example, Artem's bootloader-unlocked stock Pixel is still on Widevine Level 1, the most secure level, but fails SafetyNet because it is unlocked. The update's changelog also confirms the: "Version 5.0 only works with devices that are certified by Google and meet all Android requirements." What isn't exactly clear is why only the Play store listing is blocked, but the app itself continued to function normally. I tried both Netflix 4.16 and 5.0.4 (the latest version, from today), and both worked without problems on my unlocked and rooted Galaxy Tab S (which is labeled as Widevine Security Level 3). Maybe at some point the app will stop working, but that does not appear to be the case right now. If you have a blocked device, I recommend following the Pushbullet channel for Netflix on APKMirror (click the Pushbullet button on that page) so you can continue to receive updates outside the Play Store.

First the vpn's now this... why oh why??? Jimk4003 Surely because licensing is regionally specific, and because rooting has the potential to defeat DRM. I get that it might be annoying for some people, but aren't the reasons obvious? David Juarez But root?? Lol Semianonymous Probably an effort to reduce Region spoofing? Idk how easy that is to do on a stock device. Jimk4003 Because rooting has the potential to defeat DRM. mjh49783ab DRM doesn't work. All DRM does is inconvenience the end user. Jimk4003 Possibly. But Netflix have to negotiate licencing deals with the movie studios, and having DRM helps reassure the studios that the movies they have spent millions of dollars making aren't going to get stolen off Netflix without any attempt to stop it. mjh49783ab One could make the argument that rooting the phone may compromise the DRM. But blocking users from unlocking their phones to switch carriers? That is total bullshit, and is just the sort of thing that encourages users to pirate the content. Jimk4003 Netflix are blocking you from switching carriers? lomsha Sim unlocked phones are fine, unlocked bootloaders are blocked. mjh49783ab They didn't exactly make that clear in the article when I last read it. h4rr4r The studios need to reconsider blu rays then. Way easier to rip. Nothing they do will stop piracy. This kind of thing actually encourages it. Jimk4003 Maybe studios do need to consider Blu-ray's. That isn't Netflix's problem though. h4rr4r No Netflix problem is making sure they don't let the studios reduce the value of their product. If Amazon video works on my devices and Netflix does not that is a big deal to me. In that case I might as well sign up for more addon channels on Amazon with the mkney that currently goes to Netflix. Jimk4003 Agreed. But the studios are responsible for making the product they redistribute. It's certainly a balancing act, and I can see both sides of the argument, but Netflix isn't an inalienable right, and those who don't meet the T&C's are going to miss out. h4rr4r Sure, but the studios and Netflix are going to create pirates with these kind of actions. People aren't going to miss out. They will just pirate what they can't get legally. Jimk4003 Sure, but again, it's a tiny fraction of users. If Netflix can negotiate better terms with studios by blocking rooted devices, and thus improve their business overall at the expense of a few fringe users, it stands to reason that is what Netflix will do. Doby Gillis whaa fucking whaa. Sergio Carmona The only obvious thing here is your sarcasm detector not working properly. Go have it fixed please. Jimk4003 Nah, I'm good. h4rr4r So the reason are to make the product worse for the consumer. Great idea, now piracy looks better and better. Jimk4003 What percentage of phones are rooted though? Most people won't care, or even notice the change. h4rr4r It does not matter, if it drives even one person to piracy that is a loss. Jimk4003 But if they can ensure better licensing deals via these new terms, which will attract more customers at the expense of a few rooted users who make up a tiny fraction of overall users; will Netflix care about that loss? h4rr4r But if it encourages piracy the other side of the contract should want to avoid it. Gaining customers in the short term like this hurts the whole market in the long term. Cyber_Akuma Because yeah, people are going to rip movies from Netflix and not off a Blu-Ray.... and even IF they were to attempt to rip them off Netflix, they would use a PHONE and not a PC.... Jimk4003 Ripping Blu-rays isn't Netflix's problem, and Netflix don't need to try and guess what device someone would try and commit piracy with, when the technology exists to restrict them all. Cyber_Akuma You are missing the point, people aren't going to be ripping from Netflix over ripping from a Blu-Ray, and on top of that, they sure as hell aren't going to be ripping off a phone. And actually, you are wrong, the technology to "resist them all" does NOT actually exist. There is no one technology that "restricts them all" but several different technologies for different platforms with various levels of viability and success. Jimk4003 I said 'the technology exists'. When did I say it was a single piece of technology? Let's not be those guys who get in a pedantic argument about semantics on the internet. Regarding the issue under discussion; Netflix's job is to make their platform as robust as possible against piracy, using whatever technology is available to them. Blu-Ray simply isn't their problem. Cyber_Akuma Because just arguing "technology exists" is worthless, plenty of technology exists, and plenty of it is misused. Technically the technology to remotely brick your phone exists too, doesn't mean it's fine to use just because it "exists". And no, their platform already is robust, you are trying to ignore the fact that people ripping movies off a phone is a complete and total non-issue just to try to argue for Netflix's sake, this is ESPECIALLY considering the fact that it harms far more legitimate people than it helps. Sorry, but no, just a plain and completely undesputable NO. You can't argue that it's ok to use something that will hurt a large majority of people just to potentially possibly stop an extreme minority of people who would not even use this method anyway. That's like arguing it's ok to burn down a house to kill a spider. Jimk4003 "You can't argue that it's ok to use something that will hurt a large majority of people". We're talking about Netflix blocking rooted users; in what reality do they constitute the 'large majority' of Android users? Cyber_Akuma I meant the majority of the rooted users. Last time I checked, over 25% of people with an Android device had root access, which is several million users. And OF those several million rooted users, how many do you think actually use their rooted phone and Netflix app to pirate content? Less than 1% Hell, less than 0.1%? They are hurting over 99% of rooted Android users, which while not the majority of Android users is still a lot, to attempt to stop (and not even that effectively as there have been work-around for SafetyNet checks for nearly a year now) an extreme minority OF a minority from doing something they are unlikely to do due to other methods anyway. Richard Markert >I meant the majority of the rooted users. Even the majority of rooted users is a drop in the ocean when it comes to Android users worldwide. Cyber_Akuma Again, over 25%. You also completely missed the point of the argument in that this hurts nearly all rooted users that would not use this maliciously. Lord Argyris Looks like I'll have to start updating manually then. Or just not bother with the app at all since I rarely use Netflix on my phone as it is. SpasilliumNexus Thank goodness the 3T's Open Beta of OxygenOS is good enough for me to not unlock my device and stick with complete stock. Now I wonder why I haven't received any Netflix app updates beyond 4.16.1 build 15145 on the Play Store, when APKMirror has 4 newer versions. ast00 They asked for it. Now pirate their content knowing that you tried doing it the legal way, but THEY declined. Φώτης Because unlocking your Android powered device is such a "bad" thing to do. Whatever Netflix. Ailín Ó’S Ναι, ακριβώς... 😑 C64 How about some English Rob Google translate says that "Ναι, ακριβώς" translates to "Yes, exactly". pcriz How about some Google translate :-/ C64 This is an English website, so you have to talk English.

EowynCarter Yeah me too. And unless they change this, bye netflix account. No point in something I can't use anymore. Demoncat The funny part about video DRM is it's easily defeated. It's more convenient to steal the videos than to deal with the DRM restrictions. Fedup Exactly. Between VPN'ed torrents and nzbs, my Sonarr downloads all TV shows (netflix, HBO, ABC/CBS/NBC/FOX) automatically within minutes of them being ripped and posted by others. It is 100% automated, and with my Plex server running, I can watch shows anywhere - cost = $0.00. I don't do this to save money. I do it for the convenience, lack of ads, and freedom of time/place shifting. Heck, some shows actually download BEFORE they air on network TV (i.e. Designated Survivor). stan dex 97 new dark web premium links . also included are netfix lifetime membership links as well as graphic Live chat links (use anonymously) https://satoshibox.com/axbr7vnm6ifzk8hwtcreoe28/buy d0x360 I cancelled​ my account, sent them feedback and then just asked a friend who I let use HBO go and a Chromecast ultra if I could use their Netflix. David Gabel That seems rather dumb. Why cancel your service to them yet still use it via someone else? You're not teaching them anything. For an example, let's say you have a MacBook, and Apple does something to piss you off. You sell your MacBook, but then borrow a friend's MacBook. Nothing was actually accomplished. d0x360 Nothing was accomplished? I cancelled my account and let them know why. Now they aren't making money off me but I still to use their service. Your analogy is deeply flawed...deeply. So deeply I don't think you understand exactly what an analogy is. David Gabel So, you're "not giving them money" yet you still support them by using their product. It still seems like your logic is flawed. If you're really that pissed at Netflix, don't use it. Period. Use a different service instead of supporting them by borrowing it off a friend, as they are also giving them money (and support) , too via their subscription. revbones How is using their service for free "supporting" them? They aren't getting any revenue off you if you're not paying them. Saying you're supporting them by not paying them is a little stupid don't you think? xyz lol. So by your "logic" a person who pirates House of Cards is also supporting Netflix ? BobButtons You're doing the opposite of supporting. You're getting the benefits of their service while stopping payment and adding to server load which they pay for. David Gabel So far, your stance is the only one that makes sense. The rest so far are noise Sir Doogie Houser M.D.Esq. 200 You seen like an incredulous douch who I'd suplex onto a park bench for being a lap dog bitch.How is canceling or stealing not doing something.Also,its not a fucking macbook jerkoff its a paid service for TV on a phone they expect to be paid for.BTFO nagi Just another step that makes pirating the same content more convenient... we should really be going the other way if they ever want piracy to be reduced. lomsha Funny thing is their content is available to stream all over the internet. Don't see how this move fights piracy as long as computers have access. This just alienates legit users who are doing nothing nefarious on unlocked/rooted devices. Richard Branches By one everybody pays... Pathum Addarapathirana Dude I root my phone to just get iPhone emojis and to tether without my carrier knowing. Like I'm not stealing anything this will just make me stop paying for Netflix. Latheryin Just a heads up. Those treating hiding mods are fake. There is no way to hide if from the carrier. Heck if they wanted to they could see every web page you load from a ton of different places and ways. Yan Minari That’s why god invented VPN Latheryin Yes but even then it doesn't block everything. qqqqqq My provider absolutely blocks tethering - I've been using various methods, including VPNs, to block it for literally YEARS... Hasn't been difficult. Dylan Harris That's not true. All you have to due to bypass tethering limits on t-mobile is to change the TTL on the tethered device. Latheryin That just gets by the automated checks. Get a live person to randomly pick your account (not really likely but happens) and it is not had to tell if someone is tethering. Dmitri Smirnov All that person will be able to tell is whether customer is using a lot of data or not. And this is the root of the problem: be honest that you are limited traffic, instead of trying to play this game of "we'll pretent we are giving you unlimited data and in return you'll only use small-format mobile device, so that we'll hope that you won't be able to use as much of it". Kind of "all you can eat, but you have to only use a tea cup and one chopstick". Latheryin No the issue is people being entitled and taking advantage of things. You have people running their gaming systems and using hundreds of gb a month. Not only is that kinda dumb but it violate the fair use act in most cell TOS. If people didn't abuse the system then it wouldn't be an issue. Also just some food for thought. If they can't tell anything more then a lot of data just how do they route the traffic properly? Make no mistake. If the carrier wanted to they could tell. I know for a fact that there is a team for both att and Verizon that is tasked with just that. Dmitri Smirnov >No the issue is people being entitled and taking advantage of things. You have people running their gaming systems and using hundreds of gb a month. "taking advantage" I thought that people were in their right by using what they paid for. Allright, tell me this - is it allright for me to watch 4K video on my phone (since the screens allow it now)? What's the difference between this and me watching the same stream on my laptop over my phone's connection? What if I just redirect the video stream to my TV using WiDi or any other technology? How is browsing a site from a laptop different from browsing it from a phone network-congestion-wise? And then it boils down to the same argument - carriers are just hoping you'll use the network less from you phone device, as it's less convenient. The more convenient smartphones become for consuming large volumes of traffic, the sooner carriers will have to more away from this scan and expose the actual numbers. > If people didn't abuse the system then it wouldn't be an issue. If carriers would be honest and upfront about "hidden" caps, then people would not be able to game the system. > Also just some food for thought. If they can't tell anything more then a lot of data just how do they route the traffic properly? Make no mistake. If the carrier wanted to they could tell. Latheryin Tethering was never even an extra charge until people started taking advantage of the mobile networks. Watching 4k videos is not a big deal, using 200gb of mobile data in a cycle is flat out stupid. Mobile networks were not designed for that type of traffic from a single device. Nor was it made to handle running your ps4 while you are gaming. Why do you think that pages are made to be mobile friendly? Not only is it a usability issue but a data usage issue as well. It's not hidden. All people have to do is read the TOS. It's all right there. Yet most people just don't want to take the time to do it and then get made about it. Can't blame the carriers for that. Dmitri Smirnov > Watching 4k videos is not a big deal, using 200gb of mobile data in a cycle is flat out stupid. a) I'm glad we're finally on the same page that the real problem for networks is data usage and not tethering or no tethering. b) You are aware that you're contradicting yourself in the same sensense? 4K 60Fps video bitrate is ~20-40 MiB/s which gives an average movie the size of about 72GiB. so by your definition watching a movie in good quality is OK as long as you don't watch more than 3 of them in a month. c) how is using mobile data that you paid for - stupid? If there are caps - announce them and make it impossible to go over them instead of shaming people who actually decide to take you up on your offer. d) tethering has not been an extra charge until telcos understood that they could charge extra for it (just like them toying with idea of charging extra for Instant Messenger traffic, because it undercuts their SMS plans). > It's not hidden. All people have to do is read the TOS. It's all right there. Yet most people just don't want to take the time to do it and then get made about it. Can't blame the carriers for that. Well, carriers are the ones calling their plans "unlimited" and hiding the actual caps either buried deep in the ToS or behind the vague "reasonable usage". So don't blame people for not wanting to wade through pages of legalspeak just to learn that you lied and "unlmited" is just "50Gb and then throttled". Fedup Agreed. The problem is the AMOUNT of data consumed by a given user account - no how it is consumed. If carriers are concerned about individuals abusing their network, then they need to flag those accounts that use an excessive amount of bandwidth - whether it's through tethering or directly on the device itself. I could easily burn through 150GB/mo on my TMO Note 4 w/o tethering simply by leaving my Blue Iris app connected and streaming 24/7. So it's actually very easy to abuse the system without ever turning on the tethering. Android Developer Is the tether solution needed even if you do it using USB ? Fulbring What a stupid move. I pay for the premium for Netflix and I never thought that I might have to cancel my service just because they did this. The only reason why I have root is because of AdAway and TitaniumBackup. I still use the stock OnePlus 3T ROM. Wasn't expecting this at all.... Kinda suck. Will be interesting to see how many customers they lose. Julian Berger Not enough to change it back... 4Ui812 DRM has no place in our lives. I suspect Netflix will have a change of heart within 6 months. Branko Xiaomi phones say bye bye to Netflix. Google go fuck yourselves. Steve_Jobroni Go fucking buy a windows phone. 天地人 Seriously though Windows phones are great. The only problem with them is the lack of applications. Otherwise, it runs great on low-end hardware, has a great UI, the homescreen is innovative, synchronisation with Windows PCs is cool, etc. dukaki Don't forget that you can use the Netflix website on Edge instead of their shitty app, and it streams at full 1080p, even on my L650 with a 720p screen. 天地人 Wait the Netflix application hasn't an option to stream at FHD? dukaki Nope, just 480p like on android. The device has to be "certified" and there are no certified windows phones afaik. The WP app doesn't even have downloads yet, I think. Edit: Just checked, no option to download here but you can on the desktop app. EowynCarter Might end with a visit at the apple store in my case. Windows phone is kind of not supported anymore. Jimk4003 This is Netflix, not Google. Cyber_Akuma Google invented this SafetyNet crap, let anyone use it for any reason (Hell, Pokemon GO of all things started using it), and over the last year have been making it even more and more strict and unforgiving. So no, a HUGE part of the blame does lie on Google for being openly hostile towards rooted users and not giving a damn about them. Jimk4003 There are legitimate reasons to use Safetynet to check the integrity of a device: Android Pay (or banking apps in general) is one example. It isn't necessarily hostility to root users; it's just a reality that Google need to be able to demonstrate to banks or other third parties that their OS is secure, and that people can't bypass built in security safeguards. Netflix need to do the same with the studios they redistribute content for; and they've chosen to use Safetynet to do it. Netflix isn't a human right; you have no inalienable right to root your phone and to use Netflix. Cyber_Akuma Except that not even my own banking app uses SafetyNet, it still has root checking and certain sensitive features are disabled if I am rooted, but not the entire app. Furthermore, it IS hostility to rooted users, because anyone can toss SafetyNet into their app for any reason whatsoever (such as games using it "just because" in case of cheaters... which doesn't even help at all to stop them). Google has been completely unwilling to work out ANY sort of compromise or method that can keep a phone secure without basically tossing rooted users under the bus. Jimk4003 What sort of compromise do you envision? Cyber_Akuma I am saying that they didn't even try. PCs by default obviously allow admin accounts all the time, even as the main user account (as much as that is not recommended) yet can maintain security. Google when they were confronted with people who were hurt by SafetyNet, legitimate users mind you, basically just shrugged them off and didn't even bother considering what could be done to allow the device to remain secure while also having such safeties in place. I mean, all these apps that you can use on your phone, can also be used on a PC, many of them available in either a browser or native app format, yet it remains secure. There is no reason this could not be done with Android, especially considering it used Linux as a base, they are just refusing to even consider it. Jimk4003 Don't you already have that choice? Your phone is sold without root access (i.e. no admin rights), and you can then choose whether or not to root your device and gain elevated privileges. If you do choose to root your device, you will lose access to some Safetynet enabled applications. You can, of course, unroot if necessary. Cyber_Akuma First of all, not all phones are. Especially in non-US countries. Second, it shouldn't have to be a choice. How many PC apps refuse to run under an admin account? Practically none. I shouldn't have to choose between having root access or being able to use a apps that more and more are starting to add this nonsense to them. Third, it's not even just root, even having an unlocked BOOTLOADER now, even if your rom is 100% stock and unrooted, can trip SafetyNet, it didn't used to be that strict. It's ridiculous to claim one should be able to have one or the other, even SafetyNet could have been designed to not be this brokenly strict, but Google had no interest in doing so, and they are rapidly making having root more and more useless while we still have to deal with all the junk they force on your phone from the manufacturer... that you can only remove with root. Jimk4003 Well, it is what it is. You believe you shouldn't have to make a choice, whereas I believe life is all about making choices and living with the outcomes. We seldom get everything we want, and neither Netflix, nor rooting, are inalienable rights. Whether or not you think it should be a choice, it is one; choose what you feel is best for you. Cyber_Akuma That's not even an argument, that's just trying to claim that the status quo should remain for no reason other than it is the status quo. It shouldn't have to be a choice, and arguing that people have to choose between root and having an increasingly less amount of apps just because "it is what it is" is insanity. In fact, it wasn't even the status quo before until Google started pulling this nonsense with SafetyNet a short while ago. That doesn't mean people should just accept it. Jimk4003 It's not an argument, because there is no argument to be had. The reality of the situation is self-evident; you can't have a rooted device and install Netflix via Google Play. Accepting the status quo has nothing to do with it; it's simply acknowledging reality. You have to choose what's more important to you; Netflix or rooting your phone. Finding the reality frustrating, as you clearly do, won't make it any less real. If this was a serious discussion on human rights; censorship, migration, justice, gender equality etc., then it's important in a democracy to be aware of your rights and responsibilities, and challenge the status quo where necessary. But this isn't anything like that. This is two for-profit corporations, Google and Netflix, who provide services to which you have no fundamental right to access, nor any obligation to use. You can choose to pay for their services and accept their terms and conditions, or you can choose not to. You don't get to pick the terms and conditions of the service someone else is providing you; however you are free to not use the service if you don't like the terms and conditions under which they are provided. That's it; it's no simpler or more complicated than that. Ranting on the internet about how unfair you perceive it to be is irrelevant. Again, it is what it is. Cyber_Akuma Again, there is no "it is what it is" argument. There should be no choice, PERIOD. You are basically saying that people should not complain about this just because "it is what it is". No, it is NOT what it is, it should NOT BE what it is, and people can and WILL complain that it SHOULD NOT be what it is. You aren't even making any rational arguments anymore, just re-stating what the current situation is and then basically claiming that people should not want or expect better. Jimk4003 You can want or expect better if you like. Netflix, like every other for-profit enterprise in a capitalist system, will either succeed or fail based on its ability to turn a profit. Right now, Netflix is turning a profit, and clearly thinks it can be more profitable by excluding rooted users whose theoretical ability to circumvent DRM restrictions may impact its ability to secure rights to new content. Clearly you disagree with their stance, and the only way to see for sure if your disagreement is warranted is to watch their financial performance from here on out. None of the above changes the fact that you aren't entitled to Netflix. You've chosen to root your phone, and Netflix have recently chosen to exclude rooted users. That leaves you with a choice to make. Even if you think that choice is unfair, even if you think you should be able to have both. The reality is you can't have both, and you will have to choose. Again, Netflix isn't a right. Go elsewhere if you disagree with their business practices; that's how capitalism works. Beyond that, you're just having a spat with reality; and that's a tough fight to win ;) Cyber_Akuma Actually, what do you think would lose them more profits, the theoretical minority OF a minority that MIGHT rip movies on their phones (which still requires a Netflix account in the first place) or blocking that 25% minority? Also, drop this "right" nonsense. No, seriously, drop it right now. People are paying for a Netflix account, they DO have a right to get the service they paid for. Netflix made zero warning or mention of this impending block, they pulled it out of nowhere for paying customers. So sorry, but they DO have a right to the service, since they are paying for it. Sony was found to be legally in the wrong when they removed the OtherOS feature from the PS3, because why? Because people PAID for the console when it had that feature, they DID have a right to what they paid for. You're just having a spat with arguing for argument's sake when you don't even have an argument. Jimk4003 There is no argument; it's the reality of the situation. Netflix have implemented DRM controls that block access to the Netflix app via the Play Store on rooted devices. I do understand why Netflix want to tighten their DRM procedures, and I do understand why some people have been left frustrated by this change. The reality is, however, if you want to download the Netflix app via Google Play, you will need an un-rooted phone; such as the phones used by the majority of Android users. That's all that's happening. I get that you don't like it. But stamping your foot and shouting 'no fair, no fair' achieves nothing. Netflix are entitled to run their business how they see fit within the law; and consumers get to choose whether they want to give Netflix their business or not. That's all there is to it. Don't like the way Netflix do business; don't give Netflix your money. Cyber_Akuma All you are doing with the "it is what it is" argument is just repeating what the article is saying. That is not conductive to anything. Anyone who has read the article knows what is happening right now. And sorry, but you are doing the same stamping your foot with the "well, it is what it is" argument. Not to mention that you are also wrong, because over the last 5 or so years ALONE there have been dozens of examples of consumers speaking out against policies or DRM and the companies begin forced to reverse it from the backlash. So you are doing nothing but hurting legitimate users by trying to argue "it is what it is". And again, no, they are not entitled to run their business in a way that without warning locks customers out of what they paid for, Sony tried this... and got in legal trouble and lost. So sorry, but you are wrong, and you have been nothing but wrong this entire argument. Netflix isn't' "entitled" to do this, people DO have a reason to complain, there IS a reason to complain, complaining HAS changed such practices before, and all you are doing is further hurting legitimate users by attempting to insist the "it is what it is" non-argument. Your entire argument has been fundamentally wrong from the start. Jimk4003 It's not my argument; it's simply Netflix's position. I get you don't agree with it, but it's totally valid for Netflix to wish to strengthen their DRM procedures. You do know I'm not responsible for Netflix's decision making, right? It is what it is; I wouldn't get too upset about it. Cyber_Akuma Again, "it is what it is" is not a valid argument. Jimk4003 No it's not an argument. Again, there is no argument necessary; the reality of the situation is self-evident, and no amount of arguing here will change it. The fact is this; YOU rooted your phone. You weren't forced. You should have known that by rooting your phone you are modifying the device beyond its factory specification. You should have known that this essentially makes you responsible for the proper operation of the device; you no longer have the device manufacturer or Google to turn to when software that you have modified doesn't work as expected. You should also have known that rooting prevents a device from complying with the compatibility test suite, and that this can affect your devices ability to function correctly. You should have been aware of the SafetyNet API, and anticipated the fact that this API would be adopted more and more broadly as Google promoted its usage. You can't blame Google for this; as before, once you modify your device beyond its factory spec, you're responsible for supporting yourself. Rooting a device is at the owners risk. You've now found yourself in a situation where a modification you have made to your device prevents you from accessing a service you want to use. That's on you; no-one made you modify your device, no-one said they would take responsibility for the changes you have made to your device, and rooted users are expected to assume liability for any ramifications and complications they face as a result of their decision to modifying their device. Netflix are well within their rights to enforce DRM on their product by using the SafetyNet API provided by Google, and the Google documentation clearly states rooted devices will fail the CTS check. This documentation is publicly available. You went ahead and rooted your device anyway. That's on you. It's no-one elses job to make sense of the decisions you have taken. You're free to carry on using Netflix if you return your device to a state where the integrity of the device can be verified. Or you're free to carry on using a rooted device and living with the compromises that entails. Your choice. Cyber_Akuma I don't think you get it. All you are doing is parroting what the article is saying. Furthermore, despite there being plenty of examples of complaining doing EXACTLY what you claim it cannot do, that is to change such decisions, you keep repeating that "complaining will do nothing". You are a broken record, arguing the same "it is what it is" argument over and over so you can avoid actually thinking. An argument (and yes, no matter how much YOU stomp your feet that it is not, it IS an argument) that has already been disproven over and over and over. You also ignored that there are many countries where phones are already sold rooted, or how such things don't effect using such services on a PC with admin rights which are the same thing, or the dozens of other holes in your logic large enough to sail a ship through. There is no "you should have been aware" because this is a total lapse in common sense and my device is in no way incompatible from a hardware or software level, but rather, the app is purposely rejecting it. Furthermore, they made no prior warning whatsoever. This is like arguing "you should have known modern cars could be remotely disabled" if a dealership decides to just disable all cars with an aftermarket radio installed. I don't know where to even begin with all the broken wrong logic in that last post. Why are you even here if you couldn't care less? You are free to carry on being a living example of "First they came", but don't come crying about how nobody else is listening to you because you could not possibly be any more wrong. I DO have a right to use Netflix on my device, rooted or no, if I am paying for it. If you argue against this, you are wrong. People DO have a right to root their devices, if you argue against this, you are wrong. People DO have a right (and have many many MANY times in the past) to challenge the "it is what it is" status quo, if you argue against this, you are wrong. And I know you WILL argue against this, which will mean that, see above, you are wrong. I have been more than patient with your insane thick-headnedness. At this point I can't tell if you are being willfully ignorant or really are just that ignorant. Or just trolling, that is an option as well. There is no way anyone rational at this point can continue to argue the insanity that you have argued. Jimk4003 I interpret personal insults as an indicator that the individual making them no longer has any faith in their actual arguments, and so I think it's time to call time on this particular discussion. As you've pointed out, neither of us is getting anywhere. It's been fun, but once it starts getting abusive, the fun has to stop. It's a shame, because DRM Vs individual user rights has the potential to be a really interesting discussion topic. I hope you get what you're after; and that the reality of the situation will change to be more in line with what you think it should be. Unfortunately I imagine the situation regarding DRM and rooted devices will only get more restrictive going forward. Take care. Cyber_Akuma You purposely instigate people into losing their patience with you, and then claim "I win because you got angry", especially when the anger is because you were refusing to understand the entire argument throughout this entire mess. Richard Markert Root is, by definition, unsecure. Any time you have userland processes that have access to ring0 you are inherently unsecure, as there are no restrictions placed upon running code at that point. Cyber_Akuma And yet, there are ways to run it securely on PCs. Netflix and online banking would not be available on PCs if it wasn't. TedPhillips mostly agree. by providing a turn-key 'lockdown' check, and further by ret-conning it into playstore access (let's see how far they take that) -google is now openly hostile to anyone who bought into android for it's ability to customize and truly 'own' your own device. the open source roots of android was a big differentiator vs something like iOS, but now that they have dominate market position - they are walking away from that without concern. (only worrying about how slow they need to boil the frog to get away with it) meanwhile, what middle manager is going to say 'no' to adding safetyNet checks in their app or play store listing? it is an easy way for them to write down on potential risks, unjustified (which it pretty much always is) or not. blindexecutioner So the solution is to install from outside the play store. That's great for security. Way to go. Richard Markert No they don't. Since Windows 7, new and default users are not Admin accounts. koiulpoi Sorry, this is absolutely wrong. The first user created on a Windows PC has full administrative access, limited by UAC. You can still delete System32, it's just mildly harder than it used to be. If "new and default users" were not Admin accounts, they couldn't install software, so... Richard Markert Default user accounts are higher than Limited accounts, but not as high as Admin accounts. That's why they can install software. Linux users are not admins but can still install software, right? It started on Windows 7, expanded in 8/8.1 and now in Windows 10 a user account behaves just like a user account in Linux. It has no access to %systemdir% unless you manually go in the folder properties and give your user account Admin permissions to it. You can still run things AS admin by giving the permission at runtime, but since all that requires is pressing a button (if your built-in admin account isn't passworded, which it isn't by default, one step forward two back, sigh) and most users are too "stupid" to simply not press that button. koiulpoi It's really funny when people speak authoritatively about something they're so wrong about. The first account created by the Windows OOBE is automatically added to the Administrators group. This means they're an Administrator. They have Administrative privileges. The fact that certain actions are blocked until you click "yes" on a simple UAC prompt doesn't stop this; they're in "Admin Approval Mode", which can be disabled via GPO if you care to. If you buy a computer from Dell (example), set it up, then go to System32 and start deleting .dll files, it'll ask for administrative privileges, but you can click yes and away it goes! Some files are protected at "SYSTEM" level, which is higher than administrator, but DEFAULT USERS ARE ADMINISTRATORS. This has ABSOLUTELY nothing to do with the "password" on the built-in "Administrator" account. That account is disabled out-of-the-box. Please, you're digging a bigger hole trying to look "right". How to prove this: Set up a new computer. Set up user default for MS. Start -> Run -> netplwiz -> Be amazed that your user is part of the group "Administrators". TechGuy22 Haha kodi Doesn't matter to me I Stopped paying for Netflix long time ago. C64 Haha Teranium TV 😎 TechGuy22 I like that too. You can even get the mod one and remove the ads. Lol C64 I know, i always use those. I want to pay for the dev, but there's no option to do that. Koko time is coming with a big update to tim242 Thief. Renato Santos This is stupid. Congratulations, Netflix. Jan-Lk Else It is also getting more and more necessary to unlock / root devices due to missing updates etc. But I'm not a Netflix customer and won't become one. C64 Whahaha, this has to be the most retarded move of the year in any category (even Trump can't top this). I'm glad i don't use Old Crap Flix. A Person Hillary, then Netflix. C64 Nope sorry. Since Trump is your president i can't take America serious anymore A Person Timeout, you're not even a US citizen? No interest in your opinion. James F Wow. Just wow. I can't take you seriously either if that's how you treat people. Not cool, man. A Person "Wow, just wow"? When he can vote in our elections I'll take his opinions of our elections seriously. It is highly ill-informed anyhow. Paul Sterling A person wins! Marcelove Timeout, you are a Trump supporter? No interest in your opinion (neither anyone smart in the world). Roy Riddex Just so I'm clear on this, by unlocked are we talking about SIM unlocked? lomsha No no, unlocked bootloader. Roy Riddex Thanks Corbin Davenport Unlocked bootloader. pbergonzi I wonder how long they'll stick with that premise seeing as how much public opinion expressed here is against them. Screw them. Get the APK somewhere else or install magisk and hide your root. Too many people root their devices and have a good reason for doing so and Netflix should not penalize them. Doby Gillis Dude, normal people don't give a fuck about rooted phones. It's just the elitist twats who do it anymore. twiz0r Dude, you're an elitist twat. Richard Markert Most people who root seem to be. The sentiment among rooters is "if you don't root your phone, you're not as good as me and don't deserve to have a phone. Root you stupid noob!" twiz0r thanks for confirming your twatness. good day. C64 One word ..... Bullshit Corey Kinard I've yet to see that... Maybe you just feel like that because they do in fact know more than you? Richard Markert My first version of Android was 1.5. I've seen it for many years. How long have you been in the scene? EowynCarter My phone isn't rooted. And not compatible anymore ! Franco Fassio Unlocked bootloader maybe? EowynCarter Yes. But seam I can't lock it without wipe. So screw you Netflix. Marcelove Let me guess, your profile pic is that right? https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/0f0c4f3e3ce40074aebfe58d80511d4a0b7d4a94896ce54d82e448a1cd2e3ceb.jpg bruce lancaster Dude. It isn't just rooted phones - Also unlocked. Elitists get their iphones and galaxy s8s from att and verizon. Normal people get their devices from amazon, ebay, newegg, gearbest etc. Jimk4003 I'm sure Netflix are terrified that the tiny fraction of Android users who come to this site, and the similarly tiny fraction who root their phones, are bothered. The rest of the world won't care. bruce lancaster An article in Wireless Week (cellphone industry rag) a couple of months back says it's now a majority of phones in Asia that are unlocked and Europe is getting pretty close to 50/50. US passed 30% unlocked around Christmas. People aren't getting their phones from ATT, Verizon, etc any more now that they have to pay full retail and don't get a free or heavily discounted flagship device with contract renewal. They are getting them from Amazon, Gearbest, Newegg, etc and moving their sim. If I owned stock in Netflix right now, I'd sell it quick on this news. Everything that isn't already mobile is going mobile. Alienating half the European market and 30% of the US market is asinine. Fedup Yup. Ditched my flagship Samsung phone for a 'budget' Moto G5 Plus that is 100% compatible with all four US carriers (and their dozens of MNVOs). Swapping providers is as easy as changing the sim. And despite the slower spec'ed hardware, the carrier bloat-free Nougat is WAY faster than my TW Galaxy phone - and the battery life is INSANE. C64 Probably 90 % of the people don't know what root is. Almost every person I know owns an Android device, but i'm the only geek who flashes and roots his devices bruce lancaster It isn't just rooted phones but also unlocked phones. Got your phone on amazon? Got it on ebay? Got it from gearbest? Got it from newegg? Yup. No netflix for you without jumping through enough hoops that you'll actually know about rooting by the time you get it done. Fedup Are we conflating a carrier-unlocked vs. bootloader unlocked phone? They are two distinctly different things, and I doubt that having a carrier-unlocked phone (i.e. using a TMO phone on ATT, or VZ on Sprint) has any impact on SafetyNet or Widevine. pbergonzi Judging from the posts here it looks like nobody who roots their phone uses Netflix anyway so I guess it's moot. But the outcry sure did get them a bunch of free publicity. T4rd This is what Magisk is for. Pretty sure if I can still use Android Pay with my rooted 6P, I can still use/update Netflix through the Play Store. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Magisk still requires that you unlock your bootloader, which is enough to trigger safety net these days, so that won't work. TechGuy22 You don't know how magisk works do you Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ I understand that Magisk is a great tool for modifying my system without actually modifying it. I understand that there are many modules that allow you to do things like hide root, bypass security modules, skin your system, and plenty of other things. What I don't understand is how you can install magisk without unlocking your bootloader. Back when I originally tried it out with pokemon go, it worked well for a while, but eventually even just having my bootloader unlocked was all it took to throw SafetyNet. If that's not an issue anymore, then great! But maybe say that instead of being snarky. Thomas Gladdines Bootloader can be simply locked after rooting and installing a custom recovery. Edwin O. Lol no You could, but then you can't flash anything with said recovery... So no point Thomas Gladdines LOL the recovery doesn't stop working after a bootloader is locked, only fastboot won't flash images but the recovery can do whatever it wants to, update the rom, edit system files etc. Muzzy996 Well as an example for the Google Pixel: https://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=71901761&postcount=454 In this case all it takes is a kernel that supports Magisk and hides the fact that the bootloader is unlocked, at which point with Magisk Hide enabled all root and SafetyNet checks pass. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Excellent. I'll have to look back into this then, last time I used magisk it wasn't as capable, glad to see it's come this far. sbeaulieu Magical Hide is there for that Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Can Magical Hide hide that my bootloader is unlocked? Serious question, not being sarcastic or snarky as I was below. sbeaulieu It does make the SafetyNet check pass iJeggu Magisk itself doesn't hide an unlocked bootloader it only hides root but must custom roms simply delete the verifiedbootstate -flag which in turn makes safetynet pass even with an unlocked bootloader. Some older devices don't have this flag in their kernels in the first place so safetynet will accept that the flag is missing. Link to the patch that most custom roms (kernels to be specific) have to pass safetynet: https://github.com/sultanxda/android_kernel_oneplus_msm8996/commit/abc05b16bbd33521c2fffaf491c5657a94bfcfc5 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/5b1ff3f47e32d5f57ddadcd650a5b94725bd4e6242cea92e269f51e988d0d426.png T4rd Except it's working for me right now... jonzey231 This has been happening for a week now. I tweeted it to Ruddock a few days ago. Just didn't put together that it was because I was unlocked. https://twitter.com/jonzey231/status/862122438125072384 steelew Google really needs to start stealing from the root community the way apple takes from the jailbreak community. It feels like rooting is way down except for a few (legal) use cases. If it weren't for visual tweaks & usability tweaks, I would have no need to root (personally). This kind of stuff starts to make rooting unpleasant. I already can't use fingerprint auth in my banking app any more because root. Jesús Cuenca They do. I used rooms for like 8 years maybe? And a lot of the "new features" always come of the rom or root comunity. Right now i use roms, but not root. Marcelove I'm trying to stay indoors, but is complicate... Greenify for example, works at no root devices nowadays... But is way better with root and Xposed... Doze can't compare against Greenify... Maybe at version number 20 root wouldn't be necessary... Sandeep Raghuraman What about the version downloaded from Amazon app store though? Does that work fine? TwoBit Gary It worked, but it is old version without show downloads. Go to apkmirror oculairmedia Interesting move. I flashed a custom ROM on my Nexus 6 because stock was so slow that it was getting unusable, but screw me right ? Atoqir In my country lots of stuff doesn't work on unrooted devices. My bank app, payment app and local cable TV and digicorder app all stopped working. Also s-health doesn't work anymore and soon Netflix. Time to unroot Marcelove "Time to unroot" Sheep. Richard Markert Rooting is insecure. You don't need to access the system partition except to break things. Benjamin Walburn If that were the case then this wouldn't be an issue. Nobody is looking to break their phone. Richard Markert Few people I've talked to online know what they're doing when it comes to root. Most of those end up breaking things. Rooting is far too easy and probably shouldn't exist at all. Benjamin Walburn You could say the same about anything, not just modification of phones. Maybe you shouldn't own a car if you can't fix it yourself, or have kids if you aren't a doctor. Rooting isn't easy, it's made easy by the hard work of other people. It's not up to you what other people do with their property, you have no right to say that they shouldn't. And if someone breaks their phone, what does it have to do with you? It's their hobby and their phone. You're not their daddy. senoredusty Or use Magisk DJMix No need. You could use magisk su hide for the moment. it still passes the safetynet. I too use a banking app that cannot be used on normal root proocess faceless128 "please stop giving us money and use Kodi instead" Sounds like a great business plan! JD For the sake of Kodi's developers don't say Kodi in that context. ericshmerick Hrmm, every time I hear Kodi, I think of pirated content. Guess when people are like "I use Kodi for my 30TB media collection" I stop and wonder how... Yes, ripping a lifetime of DVDs, but nah. Probably piracy. C64 I know a few how really use it legally Powsniffer0110 Yea I use it legally 95% of the time. ErectBipedal nah man, I use Kodi to browse my 30TB of linux isos. Totally legit I swear. Chazz Matthews Torrents are legal too. Just depends on the content. Mike Honestly though, if pirate add-ons wern't available on kodi, 98% of the people using it now would not have even heard of it before. Even bad publicity is good publicity. They are not going to publicly come out and say it, but the add-on's are the only reason they're well known. Andy Roid But kodi makes piracy so easy! Blian Oh god, please stop. Nobody is using Kodi for their DVD rips. Railwayman I rather say Fusion and Exodus et al instead since Kodi is... Kodi and you have to install what you want. The Netflix business plan is for her more people on Exodus, Phoenix and SALTS - not to mention Terrarium TV and MovieBox as well. Kevin Strident Kodi is open source. If Kodi stops wanting to be as useful as it is now, someone will fork it and keep it doing what its users enjoy. cbstryker Kodi is just an open source media player. To watch any pirated content you either need to download it or install an unaffiliated plugin that streams from pirated sources. C64 Next kodi wil have drm build in. So people have to use forks. I stopped using kodi since i found Teranium TV. cbstryker That makes zero sense. Kodi's reason for existing would stop. C64 That's BS my friend, Kodi (xbmc) has started on the original xbox and was made and used as a media player Justin D Same...but with Plex and something else >.> Dany Lol I know right? I was using Kodi more than Netflix anyway so... Dmitry Stepanushkin Xposed + RootCloak or something similar will do it for most of apps for those who need root. So I think not a big problem. Abhishek Saral Not a big problem but a big annoyance. tehboogieman Hmm, rootcloak isn't working for me with netflix m477 No, it won't work. Safetynet always fails if you have closed activated, or if you just have an unlocked bootloader. Sometimes even by just having adb debugging turned on. Kan☆n MagiskSU and its manager app comes with a very good hider built-in. No Xposed needed. h4rr4r Beyond pointless. Netflix won by being easier than piracy, this threatens to turn back the clock on that. Lexster These companies don't seem to get that most people pirate because it's easier/cheaper than buying what they want. Yes, it's wrong, whatever, the point is streaming services made it easier for people, which outweighed the hassle of pirating it. You're right, this kind of thing is what will get people to start doing it again more. BobButtons If I can't use Netflix on my rooted phone, it's Netflix that'll go, not the root. They're encouraging piracy. YaKillaCJ Exactly. Screw it, I only have Netflix for convenience. This will also have negative impact on many devices and average consumers even if they never unlock or root. A lot don't have Google certification, such as upcoming OEMs. Then theirs beta roms like Xiaomi and OnePlus that run awesome. Marcelove Funny thing: I was about to become a subscriber of Netflix after seeing House of Cards by PirateBay but now through the official channel because I thought that Netflix deserved my money... Look : deservED... But this movie will keep me at PirateBay... Funny thing 2: I have a Moto G5 that I could unlock and root and I didn't it just because I wanna see how things are nowadays without root... And I use a lot of apps that would work better with root (Greenify for example)... So I would be able to use Netflix... And I won't and will stay that way only because this douchebag move... Congratulations Netflix... Funny thing 3: So happy that I waited till House of Cards release to become a subscriber... Netflix should learn something from Frank Underwood... And from Blockbuster... tim242 Yeah, sure you were. Once a thief, always a thief. koiulpoi This is the most untrue statement I've read on this website. Thomas Elephants can fly 天地人 http://gadling.com/2012/06/10/airline-transports-herd-of-african-elephants-photos/ koiulpoi Nice! You matched it. 天地人 Yes, because illegally pirating from huge corperations which constantly attempt to and successfully brainwash people into agenda using various tricks, is somehow bad? You're not supporting the creators of the show, sure. But you're also not supporting the 6 Jewish companies that control 90% of American media. Anyways, with your little money you wouldn't be benefitting anybody. Do you honestly think those Jewish companies are dying to get a hold of your $120 you payed for Netflix this year? Probably not. The creators of the show, are well off anyways. Don't companies pay them to have their content on their platform and pay for their production cost and wages? Then; they've already been payed. I'm not endorsing piracy. It isn't the best thing to do, but I think calling people a "thief" and grouping them with people who have actually stolen things off individuals which mean a lot to the individual and murdered some individuals in the process, is just stupid. It's not the same as 'stealing' bits of 1s and 0s. Again, I'm not endorsing piracy, however there are a lot of good reasons to pirate movies and TV shows. Paul Sterling You're a thief. People leave their families for months to give you works of art. Games, movies, music. You can't throw them a few bucks? I'm legit, always will be. Also, tax helps everyone. Your wall of text is just trying to convince yourself, thief. 天地人 Nope. A thief is different from a pirate, besides, they've already been payed. And I was talking about TV shows and movies, but you're too dense to realise it. jj14x Not the same. If I spend time writing code for software, and decide to sell a monthly license instead of a perpetual license, that is my choice. Your choice should be to either subscribe to the monthly license, or to find a competitor software to use instead. Choosing to bypass the licensing checks makes you a thief (taking something without the owner's permission makes you a thief). And same logic applies to TV shows/movies. If you want to own the movie and watch it whenever you want it, BUY it. "illegally pirating from huge corperations which constantly attempt to and successfully brainwash people into agenda using various tricks, is somehow bad?"<-- YES - it is still illegal. Just because somebody stole your car doesn't mean you can go and steal that person's car in retaliation. There are laws and procedures on how to handle that. STDog Illegal != bad, legal != good. Thousands of unjust laws have been passed. They made actions illegal that were not bad. Richard Markert It's trickle-down, man. Think about if everybody thought like you. Netflix has 100 million subs and each pay at the minimum $107/yr and that's 10.7 billion. Now if that 10.7 billion were wiped out in an instant, how is Netflix going to make new shows or seasons of existing shows? It's the same with the rest of the content creation business. You and me, we're just a drop in the bucket when it comes to their revenue, but instead of scooping it out a spoonful at a time while adding water by the cup, somebody dumped the bucket over, there would be no money left to pay the content creators before content is even made. Railwayman I guess you like DRM and proprietary vendor lock in? The only moral of the story is: Pay for legit services then and watch posted content - the creators get paid and you get proper content without restrictions. The day the industry realize that DRM, geo blocking and so forth are counter productive will be historic. Fedup Love my Moto G5 Plus. Best phone I've had so far - and that's coming from a number of Samsung flagship phones. It's so much snappier and the battery life is insane. I waited a full 48 hours before caving and unlocking/rooting. Haven't looked back. I hate ads, and w/o root, you can't miracast to anything other than chromecast. Trysta Noticed this a little while ago. The crazy thing is I'm not even rooted or interested in any mods. I needed to sideload the latest version 7.1.2 because my RMA Nexus 6p refused to update on its own. I'm keeping the bootloader unlocked so I can recover if my phone boot loops. I rarely use Netflix on my phone but this is kind of annoying. I suspect this has something to do with offline movie watching (which is amazing). jj14x You don't need to unlock bootloader to sideload the full OTA images that Google publishes on their website. Tim Harman But you do need it to recover in your phone bootloops, as he said. jj14x True, but by that logic, everyone should keep their phone's bootloader unlocked all the time (because a bootloop, in theory, could happen to anyone/anytime) - not just when flashing a factory image. EowynCarter You don't ? Had to when installing a developper preview. Then I left it that way, so I won't be locked out in case of boot loop. TedPhillips or when you have some random block on disk get corrupted, ala nexus 9. ilovetesla Dumbest blocking I've ever heard Bruce Wayne I stopped rooting ages ago. Android has gotten so good that I don't need it anymore. Muzzy996 Good for you! Not everyone feels the same though, I know I sure don't. Tasker, Adaway, Greenify, Titanium, Substratum and GMD Gesture Controls are all more important to me than Netflix. The day Netflix stops working on my rooted devices (which are what I watch it on, not my TV) is the day I'll cancel my service. No big loss compared to losing root. Richard Markert Tasker is interesting but never felt the need for it. Adaway, titanium are both irrelevant on my S7, I despise gestures beyond simple swiping in the Cardinal directions, and if stock Android is so perfect why do you need to theme it? C64 I have a s7 edge and the stockrom is full of bloatware from Microsoft, Sansung and Google. More than 20 useless apps are included. So yes the s7 needed root. tim242 Wrong. Package Disabler, no root required. Richard Markert No, it doesn't. Everything not necessary for function is disableable. C64 You can't disable everything Muzzy996 Never said android is perfect, if it was there wouldn't be any competition in the market or users such as myself who feel the need to customize Android. Root is not something I push onto others, its just something that I want on my devices and I make choices about what services I use or devices I purchase based upon my ability to do it. Railwayman I take that you like ads, then? Using a non-rooted Samsung without Taller would be like using a feature phone again but with ads. Having an automated device without ads and bloat is certainly a basic requirement to me. Richard Markert Adhell and Disconnect pro. What's an ad? Railwayman I don't see any ads on my Ericsson GF388 either. Don't have to install a single piece of software in order to get there. Ericsson win, Samsung loose.:) Your Samsung still has Google ad services and so forth running even if you are blocking them on the "non root level". My devices are completely ad free with Google ads disabled system wide and in all apps. Samsung loose every time even if their followers are trying to find different "non root methods" to "solve" things that other devices do without any issues due to... root. kostas110 maybe if you use some 500+ euro smartphone from 2016-2017 something that not everyone can do C64 I disagree, Android is one big advertising if you don't use root. Apps have ads (not every app has a pro version), internet browsing sucks without Adaway (build in ad blockers in browsers aren't great), YouTube really sucks if it isn't modded (watch a 30 second ad for a 3 minute movie). And devices are full of bloatware that can't be removed without root. Even the Google stuff are bloatware (kiosk, movies,music,books etc). I also like to remove alot of system apps and replace them with my own apps that i prefer (file manager, agenda, email, music/ video player) and i really hate duplicate apps on my devices. Also Titanium Backup is important to me. So Android​ without root isn't Android for me. jetscreamer01 I use adguard to block stupid ads in my apps. Now using any commercial apps is enjoyable. Richard Markert Samsung's Internet has the Adblock extension and it literally blocks everything. I also use Disconnect Pro and Adhell for system-wide ad blocking. Titanium Backup I never really used even back when I was rooting phones - it has been replaced 100% by Smart Switch. But then, I haven't needed to restore a backup (except for switching devices) in years, probably because I don't run janky community junkroms. Muzzy996 The only reason you feel that Smart Switch completely replaces Titanium is because you never used other features of Titanium that go beyond what Smart Switch is intended for. Things like shortcuts to freeze/defrost apps, multiple version backups or market management are useful to some even if they're on rooted stock OEM ROMs. They're not must haves for the masses though but some of us do appreciate their usefulness. Cyber_Akuma I hate this response. If anything, I have found far more reasons to root than ever before. Being able to create a backup image and install security/tracking software tat can't just be wiped/uninstalled easily is a big one for example. DJMix I really couldn't understand these kind of stupid moves. I mean I kinda get for an Android Pay or some banking apps to implement these limitations. But seriously, a frickin' streaming app? Afraid they're gonna get pirated? For someone who's going to pirate, they probably could just probably reverse engineer the apk and remove the limitations or basically use older apps. Do they really have some idle engineers that they're forced to implement useless feature? ddevito Guess I'll just pirate it all soon. Their loss. JD Fuck Android If OEMs would fucking provide updates for 5 years I wouldn't need to unlock my bootloader. I'm out. I'll come back when Google fixes this shit. Also fuck Netflix. Back to pirating it is. Christopher Bement My app stopped working on my N7 when I sideloaded 5.0. Got an error when trying to play anything. I went and dropped it back to stock on the latest patch and relocked the bootloader. All working fine now. Too fucking bad, Nougat is fantastic on that device, leaps and bounds better than Marshmallow. tehboogieman Which ROM and which N7 do you have? I still have the stock ROM on my 2013 N7 LTE and have been procrastinating loading an N ROM on it Christopher Bement 2013 LTE version and I was using Nitrogen OS (fantastic and stable ROM). I am now on the latest Marshmallow just so that Netflix will work. tehboogieman As long as I can side load it and sign in I'm still ok. It's a pain, but I'd live with that. But if NF blocks root users from signing in, I'm definitely cancelling and just use one of the very easy pirate apps. Fedup As long as you can side load... Sure. But going from "hidden app in the Play store" to "sideloaded app won't run" is probably on the menu. Wayne Randall I just signed up for Netflix so I could cancel it. I'm part of the group. tim242 You paid them... Richard Markert Hahahahahaha I don't even use Netflix on my phone (screen is too small) so I don't care. But man, the tears and butthurt from the root community is hilarious. Benjamin Walburn You're a very petty child. Richard Markert When something makes me laugh, I point it out. I do that even have a dog in this hunt. I only watch Netflix on my 75" LED TV. I'm just tired of root users smugness. Almost as smug as apple users. Benjamin Walburn You're tired of people being smug in their hobbies, so you gloat about the problems inflicted on them pointlessly? Petty and a hypocrite. Richard Markert What else am I supposed to do to remove the smugness? My name is…. Get a life maybe? Benjamin Walburn Why should you? Is another person's happiness really that painful for you? You already know that they accomplished nothing more than "successfully followed instructions." It seems like your purpose would be better served by targeting that, not just being a jerk. Humbling them is one thing, being an ass is another entirely. tim242 You sound like the petty child. Stomp your foot, becauseyou don't get your way. Benjamin Walburn Not only am I not doing that, I'm not not getting my way, and "stomping​ my foot" is not an example of pettiness. Your wrongness-density is impressive. My name is…. Who beat you as a child? Richard Markert Lol koiulpoi You're on androidpolice.com... making fun of the root community... and unable to see past the end of your nose... Don't you have anything better to do? Richard Markert Actually, no. I read Android police because they have the best coverage of software. koiulpoi I didn't realize I replied to you twice. You're all over this article, with really, nothing better to do, huh? Richard Markert Yeah, I'm bored. I'm probably done stirring shit up anyway, today is water change day on my fish tanks. lomsha Tard Railwayman Are you one of those Samsung Apologists that argue against root and proudly tell everyone about the perfection known as Grace UX... just to install Package Dsabler Pro because... something disturb all "perfectness" of their system? Trying to be an "anti-social elitist" is like proudly use Simple Finder on a Mac and tell everyone that you don't need the regular Finder.;) Richard Markert I use Samsung, but only because it offers the best mix of software and hardware for me. And package disablers are garbage. Railwayman I avoid Samsung like a plague because of Knox 0x1 Warranty Void, Grace UX (TW...) and pretty ugly hardware not to mention the software design, which looks like a cheap toy, both colors, design and all S-This and S-That they preinstall. Don't forget DT Ignite so the carriers can add their share. It is always amusing when the Samsung Apologist proudly claim how good it is to live without root and how "mature Android has become" when they are talking about a heavily modified fork of it. If Samsung could replace Google Play with Galaxy Apps, they would. The only thing restricting them from further modification is the CTS in order to be able to use Play. An unrooted Samsung running Grace? It would be like having a feature phone again. Way too many annoyances and no way of making it more pleasurable since the whole thing is... Samsung. The only area where there are some reminiscence of Android is under the About box. Samsung is a disgrace not to mention a complete parody on the concept of an Android device. Not to mention their followers who recently "spotted" the bezel less display (introduced by Sharp and LG followed by Xiaomi) because... the S 8 got it AND suddenly made it a "requirement". The most kind thing I can say about that brand is this: Samsung is for the Android device and platform what McDonald's is for the thing called food.;) There are way better devices available. Buying a Samsung is like getting a Big Mac (the difference is that the Big Mac buyers doesn't claim its superiority - while Samsung buyers always try to claim how "superior" their devices are). Richard Markert Everything in your first paragraph is purely subjective. I find the design of the Pixel to be ugly, boring and derivative. AOSP design language doesn't appeal to me. I also think Samsung's software suite is better than Google's. My 935U doesn't have DTIgnite, but my 935V does...as does the Verizon branded V20, Moto Turbo2, etc. DTIgnite is a Verizon thing. Bezel less phones are sexy, for sure. That Sharp device was a Sharp device, and the Xiaomi has a CDMA radio so I could use it on Verizon , but just can't justify buying a thousand dollar device from China. It is stupidly gorgeous though. I use Samsung because I like the software design. I like the functionality of the base is and apps, and I like the S-app suite. I really miss my Note 7, and I'll be swapping up to a Note 8 when it's out. Don't get me wrong, Samsung phones have their negatives - chief among them is the fragile design and the screen edge touch rejection sucks ass. But for me, the positives outweigh the negatives. Other phones have bigger negatives for me. No IP68, no uSD card, no wireless charging, no SAMOLED display. Phone preference are always subjective. Somebody will always have a reason to pick one over another. Tell me, if Samsung is a "parody" of the concept of an Android device, what is your description of the perfect Android device? I'm guessing it's the Pixel. Railwayman Pixel is an ugly iPhone clone. The best Android device so far would be something like a Xiaomi Mi Mix running Resurrection Remix or similar ROM or something like a Mi Max but with perfection added through a Snapdragon 835, 256GB storage plus microSDand 6-8GB RAM paired with a 1440p 6.44" display or even 4K. 5000-6000 mAh battery. My Xiaomi Mi Max is excellent but would be even better with the aforementioned hardware (I can't fault is existing hardware but I am taking about a new model). A keyboard flipcover would be a great accessory as well. There are no device yet worthy of the perfect moniker yet but my Max is the best thing so far in my collection beside the Nokia Communicators and HTC TP2 and HD2 and also the Xperia Z Ultra when I do the holistic judgment. IP68? Sony all the way to me if I really insist. MicroSD? No need for a Samsung in order to get it. Yes, Samsung is a kind of a parody of an Android device die to their heavy modifications, restrictive policies, low price /performance ratio, carrier branding and Knox 0x1 Warranty Void. The upcoming OnePlus 5 looks promising - they usually get their things right. MicroSD on that one as well.;) If Samsung make a device without any BS such as restrictions, carrier links paired with good price / performance ratio I would be interested. Let's call it a Note Pro. What I don't like with Samsung are all Apologists making excuses for their policies. I have nothing against them as a company or production. They can make excellent products but their policies stop them right now. It is too much McDonald's mainstream and too little class at this time. Carrier devices are typically too mainstream than the unlocked ones. MadMartigan What are are you, seven? me me A primary reason to root is to run adblock because Google is way too greedy. So the irony, Google's greed means there's less reason to pay for NetFlix. Let me guess... shall we? Google Play Movies still works right...? Oh yes, so long as Google makes their money.... tim242 I block ads with Adguard. No root required. Mike | Homeless On Wheels People still use Netflix? Bit Torrent is your friend. dizel123 Exactly. Everyone should stop using Netflix. Not sure how I'm gonna get the shows i currently watch on Netflix from bit torrent since they won't be made anymore once Netflix is shut down, but at least I'll have my bit torrent friend tim242 Some people like to do things properly. Railwayman You mean - Do it with DRM? You can't buy whatever device you want because a content provider disagree. You can't use the system you want because a content provider disagree. You can't use the app you want because a content provider disagree. I need a lot of apps, ads and limitations for the so called "proper way" . The "improper way" is Samsung free, ad free and bloat free - and I don't need several apps because I have just one or two streaming apps, one media player, one book reader and so on. Fast and efficient system to boot. I think I prefer to do things "improperly". Richard Markert >The "improper way" is Samsung free, ad free and bloat free - and I don't need several apps because I have just one or two streaming apps, one media player, one book reader and so on. Fast and efficient system to boot. *sigh* I bet you think deleting the APKs from /system actually gives you more space in /data, too. Railwayman Perhaps you can tell me the benefit of having Kindle, Kobo and Nook instead of MoonReader for everything. The benefits of having an uprooted system, Netflix, Hulu and a couple of apps for different cable services instead of having just one media center would also be interesting to know more about. When we are at it: Why would I want to use a 3GB+ Samsung ROM when Resurrection Remix are 600 MB and the G-Apps around 340 MB? Richard Markert I dont use any of those. Phones are too small for media consumption. I don't have any video streaming or playback apps on my phone. Nor do I have book readers, but why wouldnt I want Kindle? It's the only way to access the Amazon library... Oh wait, I forgot, you do that believe in compensating content creators. Resurrection remix, really? If I put that on my S7 edge, I'd be wiping out half the hardware's capabilities in one blow. No Samsung pay, no edge panels, no pro mode camera, no AOD, no game tools, no GearVR. And im sure none of the little things I've come to expect in my UI, like direct calling and sliding a contact to call/txt. But I can move the clock to the other side of the notification shade, woohoo! Oh and does the installer for RR rom repartition the file system? Because if not, /system will still be 3gb, not 600mb. And on top of that, I'm immediately reminded of iOS when I looked at their screenshots. Railwayman So RR looks like iOS? Interesting. It looks like Android with Material Design on my device. I buy Kindle books but send them through a plug-in since the Kindle app pretty much suck in comparison with MoonReader. Sometimes I also buy from Google Play Books and it is also a trip through the plug-in for them and then into the MoonReader library. You see - DRM is a stupidity that must go way unless they create a device wide scheme so any app can authenticate and show or play back the content. I understand that Samsung phones are too small for media consumption. A 6.44-7 inch display is different - it works comfortably without the heft of a 10-12 inch tablet. Small displays below 6-6.3 inches are just too small. So your listed features of your Samsung are hardware? They certainly sound like software to me. Or do you seriously believe that Samsung use co-processors in their device like Commodore did on the Amiga? I can assure you that your Samsung contain standard hardware with a lot of subcontracted components, especially in the US market where they even use Qualcomm CPUs. Samsung Pay? Why would I use an OEM dependent payment system? My credit cards follow a standard, why should I pick myself into a specific device OEM just to pay? It makes no sense. It is like having a car that only runs on Citgo gas or a 4" Visa card requiring different terminals than my 4.5" MasterCard. Mobile payments will be a thing when a standard are in place. Payment systems requiring me to lock myself into a specific OEM just suck. Edge panels? Don't see the need. Don't like Edge displays with their optical side effects. Flat display or just slight roundness on the edges like the BlackBerry PRIV here. Pro Mode Camera? I prefer to have the Open Camera API so any app can get RAW from the sensor and do their thing rather than locking myself into the default camera app. I prefer Camera FV-5 or A Better Camera etc. The Snap Camera is good too. Always on display? Can set it up on my device but don't see the need when there are things such as Active Display and a lot of other options. Game tools? I don't see any problems with gaming on other Android versions so I just don't see what Samsung can add in this regard. Gear VR? Why would I want to strap my device to my face when there are dedicated VR headsets available for gaming consoles and computers? I certainly prefer to have a full headset rather than using my device as one. Call features? They could be good but carrier calling is old fashioned. I use Google Voice instead and wouldn't consider going back to carrier talk and text. Don't see any benefit with having a phone number tied to a carrier of SIM card. Having more than one for different purposes on the same device without SIM dependency is the modern way. I don't know if RR repartition Samsung devices so you have to check XDA. That brand is probably the worst when it comes to ROMs anyway and a lot of my dislike of them are related to that particular issue. Samsung is nothing more than the Big Mac of Android devices and no Gear VR or Samsung Pay (it is like having a McDonald's Pay) really change anything. A mainstream device with mainstream design with too many round edges and corners not to say fragile, batteries that wear out fast due to lower quality and fast charge (which stresses the cells heavily), a software design looking "something" , bloat ware, carrier BS such as bloat ware and also the price model, Knox and root/ROM restrictions, locked bootloadern - the list goes on and on. Mainstream degenerated art is what Samsung represents. But I know the existence of people who don't believe in freedom of choice other than the freedom of buying their Samsung from their carrier and then happily oblige and reduction imposed to them all the way down to the SIM card dependent phone number and roaming charges when they travel.;) They also consider Samsung Pay to be the best thing ever - a payment system that only work on a particular OEM. It really is like a car that require Citgo gas and is unable to run on Exxon or Esso fuel. Samsung just are the Big Mac of Android devices. There are just nothing "classy" over such a carrier mainstream brand. If you want to know what luxury are? Look at Vertu. derp_cookies So I agree this is a dumb move but everyone is overreacting by threatening to pirate content. This is a niche problem as less people root now, especially since Android pay won't work when you do it. So Netflix isn't any less accessible than it was before. I watch 99% of Netflix at home on my Roku. Luxferro It's not just rooting. My Nexus 6P is running stock google rom, no root, w/ just unlocked bootloader, and netflix is gone in my play store. Not that I watch TV on my phone... but my shield tv is also unlocked... so it's probably just a matter of time. Roh_Mish Dammit Netflix, you make me want to go popcorn time route. My current primary phone and my iPad are what I use to watch netflix and both of them is stock so i don't have anything to worry about but this just feels wrong. Between this and Amazon not releasing the TV app for my sony TV, which they support outside, popcorn time (and in extension piracy) just seems easier. Vivek Rameses This is why we have piracy. Miguel Angel But ...why? occono Distributors want Netflix to stop any possibility of making DRM-Free backups on the content. Railwayman Good luck with that. If it can be played, it can be recorded. As long as the Netflix content is visible somewhere a copy can be recorded so again, good luck with blocking. Mariano Moreira Even more strange is while Netflix app is removed from Playstore, Netflix VR is still.in Playstore. Manually flashing Factory Image for Google Pixel is how I get me OS updates and I choose to leave bootloader unlocked, rather than relocking every month.(which would include full wipe) So I guess they don't care about security for the few users whom might use Netflix VR with Daydream compatible device? tehboogieman I'm not familiar with the Pixel, but almost every Nexus device lets you lock without wiping all your data. Maybe that requires root though, I really don't understand the details on how it works, but hopefully you can find a way to do it. Mariano Moreira To clarify: In order for me to install Factory Image every month, I need to have Bootloader unlocked. Doing the Factory unlock will wipe the device. Locking the device doesn't wipe the device, but Factory unlocking the bootloader will wipe the device. tehboogieman Yeah, sorry I wasn't more specific. I use an app called BootUnlocker. It lets you lock and unlock the bootloader without wiping at will. Since an app can do this, I'm assuming that it can be done via ADB. Also it might only work on older devices, but maybe there's a way to replicate this action on newer devices as well Mariano Moreira I don't understand why Google is promoting Security by having the device fully-locked, yet still relies on ADB fastboot unlock/OEM Unlock commands to flash factory images? saf1927 Why are using factory images when Google provides OTA images too, and these don't require an unlocked bootloader, nor a wipe? jdrch It's not just Netflix. The HDHomeRun Prime app doesn't work on rooted 7.0+ devices either. Jsilvermist Good to know, will no longer recommend Netflix to anyone when I'm asked... James F News flash: when you explain to most normal people why you don't recommend Netflix, they won't care, because it doesn't affect them. D13H4RD2L1V3 This is stupid. I had to root my phone to be able to hide the navbar at any time I want and also to gain better battery management controls and other stuff that I sorely wished Google had added to stock Android way sooner. And I was considering a Netflix subscription. No longer...... Sruly J I know it's not fully a solution which is "worth it", but the app Custom Navigation Bar offers the ability to hide status bar/narbar without root. Although like you said, you had other reasons to root, so... Diar I pay for Netflix so I can watch the content any way I want guilt free, whether that's their app or other locations on the Internet. F their VPN blocking and DRM. If they make their app impossible to use, I just won't use it. They'll still get my money but they will lose any data/tracking since I'll still be watching their shows, just outside of their ecosystem. Dummies. ReedSolomon Between the SJW nonsense like Bill Nye, the ipv6 tunnel blocking (rather than simply defaulting to ipv4), increases in price, less and less quality content, and now this, I see little reason to keep paying for Netflix. robogo I understand Netflix' reasons, I really do - they need to protect their property and investment. But I can't really say I understand the way they're doing this. This is a good way to alienate the small percentage of power users who root their devices for various, but perfectly valid and understandable reasons. And no, this will not make me cancel my membership as long as the app works. Cancelling membership is a silly, overblown reaction to what is, in my mind, a minor nuisance. D13H4RD2L1V3 I personally just find it a dumb move. Seems like an easy way out. Dmitri Smirnov > perfectly valid and understandable reasons. And what reason would that be? Preventing people from ripping their content? Doesn't stop them in the slightest, root-detection in circumvented rather easily as well as safety net, we have PokemonGo to thank for that - a lot of people were motivated to crack it and they succeeded. > Cancelling membership is a silly, overblown reaction to what is, in my mind, a minor nuisance. Cancelling membership is valid form of feedback to the company, that trying to tell it's customers that they are not allowed to own their device that they paid their money for, if they want to watch a movie. robogo You misunderstood, it seems. A perfectly valid and understandable reason to root one's device would be, e.g. Xposed framework, theming support, tethering, backing up stuff with Titanium Backup, etc. Please read my comment once again. EowynCarter Well, if and when it stops working on my phone, what will be a major nuisance. robogo Agreed. I'll have to find another way then. But I'll deal with that when the time comes. Manbearpig I member when netflix released there app for Android and they did the same thing. I would just download the app and be good to go. After awhile though I stop rooting I miss it sometimes Cyber_Akuma I warned people when Pokemon GO of all things had a surprise update that silently added SafetyNet that this garbage was going to become more and more common. Mario RUN uses it too, and now Netflix.... soon apps everywhere are going to add SafetyNet and block rooted devices as standard practice. Google has been incredibly hostile towards people who actually want to own or have control over their devices or even their PC Software over the last few years. And over the last year google has been making SafetyNet more and more harsh, now even tripping if your BOOTLOADER is unlocked even if your phone is not rooted. Pokemon GO and Mario RUN were a small crowd, but I hope after Netflix of all things starts using it (and make no mistake, this is just the beginning) that people will finally push back against Google's hostility towards rooted users. EowynCarter Yeah. Or I might seriously consider going the iOS way. Though iOS would pose other problems. (Bye paylib) BillPosters I rooted my Android phone to get rid of the annoying camera shutter sound, and to prevent apps from stealing my contacts, and to basically take control of my device rather than letting Google run the whole show, and because of that I can't update Netflix? Good riddance Netflix. iKon I'm pretty sure you can go in the camera settings and take of the camera shutter sound?.... .. In some region-specific firmware versions or certain devices you can't do that. Railwayman There is a better solution: Declare the device a DRM free zone and use everything else. DRM to me is "Don't Restrict Me!" and an excellent reason to give certain companies the middle finger telling them to just go and F themselves. The most ironic thing here is that removing Netflix or using DRM otherwise doesn't stop piracy. On the contrary - By buying and using DRM content you get to travel in the cargo hold with no heating while the pirating consumer get first class service: more content, no restrictions, no copyright trailers or ads before the movie start and stop on. Even better: They can use whatever apps or ROMs they want. Would I unroot my device in order to get DRM content onboard? No way!!! If Netflix are so scared - block the client on Mac OS X and Windows et al. Piracy doesn't usually happen with an Android device as a source but rather computers and HDCP rippers. Another thing also to the DRM companies: Everything that can be played back can be recorded! (Good old piracy saying) Netflix out, Fusion with Exodus, SALTS and Phoenix in. Kodi with Rapier skin is much nicer than the Netflix client and Trakt integration make this way a much better one than going down the DRM route, sitting with an uprooted stock ROM and Netflix.;) TechJunkie198 ? netflix isn't scared. the studios require the drm. and netflix isn't concerned with the small percent of users who root their devices. Railwayman Doesn't matter. Go and enjoy your DRM services.;) DRM is a pest and that is why the pirating community offer a superior product. It is easier and more hassle free to just put Netflix where they belong and use Exodus et al or MovieBox or Terrarium TV and so on. To those who now consider unrooting because of Netflix: Just don't - use other services instead. Richard Markert So when everybody takes your advice and uses a service that doesn't compensate anybody in the content creation business, and all the high-quality media is gone, don't go crying about there being nothing good to steal anymore, k? Railwayman Even better: DRM and proprietary vendor lock in are scrapped and replaced by standards. If they want some kind of protection - make it device wide and linked to the account signed in so playback works in different apps - only thing needed is to call the system wide authentication system. I am against DRM and vendor restrictions. Original content without any of the BS is what the world need. Piracy is a symptom of several problematic things such as geo restrictions, root restrictions and the failed idea of the "right of no distribution" - i.e. the content exist but stubborn companies deny distribution using silly arguments. I always remove DRM from purchased content in order to have full control including the basic right of using whatever app or equipment for playback. Richard Markert Start developing the solution, and start a content creation company that can compete with the big boys when it comes to quality content. Or, you can sit around and whine online about the content creators not wanting the people who don't follow rules to play in their gated sandbox and get mad when you crawl over the fence. Railwayman I take that you like DRM and proprietary vendor lock-in. It is easy to avoid the gated sandbox so no need to whine. It is easier to just fire up Exodus rather than relocking the bootloader and flashing a stock ROM or remove SuperSU in favor of Magisk just to be able to get Netflix. DRM is such a waste of time. It's not necessary to develop a new service since the content are available DRM free already. Standards for media and books etc does exist or did you miss EPUB, PDF, AAC, MP3, MP4 and so on? Perhaps you prefer such a format as ZNO or Apple modified EPUB that only works with iBooks? saf1927 Magisk seems to do the trick. Helios What about my non-rooted OnePlus One? It's also listed as incompatible.. '-_- 天地人 Don't OnePlus devices run a custom ROM and have unlocked bootloaders? Android Developer How can they block people who root the device from installing the app? The play store doesn't have this filter. Maybe after the install they do this check? Richard Markert If you're really an Android Developer, you would know that SafetyNet is what's doing this "behind the scenes". Android Developer I'm talking about the article. They say that Netflix blocks rooted devices, and I know that this isn't an option on the developer console. Google doesn't have anything related to rooted devices there. Ezio I have about 200 original blu-ray disks, go to cinema, and I'm Netflix subscriber. Now I won't get app updates (or even worse I won't be able to use it in the future) just because I like to use my custom rom. Thank you. This is really a bad move. AdjustedFlow I thought netflix was about providing a better service than piracy. Now they're literally pushing me back to piracy. What the heck? Dany If for "root" they mean administrator privileges, don't we already have that on windows 10? So why Netflix doesn't block desktop version too? P.S. by the way...whatever man! I was using Kodi more than this crap anyway... Miku is Best Vocaloid This means Netflix won't be getting my business anymore. Paul Sterling No worries here, when you're legit. Take my money, I'm not cheap. Give me a service, I'll pay you. I don't need to rob. What am I? 13 living with my mom using Napster? Naw, grew up. Don't have any Tim foil hats. My wallet grew up too. ast00 This is a dick move that could have been avoided. If they want us to pirate their content instead, we will pirate their content. We tried doing it the legal way, but they didn't allow it. Their problem, not ours. EowynCarter Umf. **checks google play ** No longer compatible with my nexus 6 . But nexus 4 still ok. For crying out loud! I'm not rooted or using a custom ROM. Pyramid Power netflix is just losing money. it's saying to those people, 'go to thepiratebay!'

Netflix is a client app. If I can, with a rooted phone, fake my subscription, or somehow cause a major security issue, that is not a problem with me, that is a problem with you pushing out a vulnerable app to millions of users. Sure, it would be my fault for exploiting it, but there is no-one but you who managed to put the problem in place. A CLIENT app should not be anything but a front-end representation of an API run by your servers. The CLIENT should have nothing but a CLIENT ID to use with the API. The CLIENT should NOT be able to change JACK SHIT with the API, it should only be able to get search results, get access to encrypted streams, etc. If your client CAN change JACK SHIT (which one could assume is true, since you are so actively hiding your code) then you have a major security vulnerability... This is a problem with your code, not anyone's rooted device... Hell, you don't even need a rooted device to access the applications code, just download an APK of the app, extract it, and decompile it... Jesus netflix, get your shit straight you bendy pos... BahnStormer Netflix is used more on tablets and TV boxes, these tend to be used for several years longer than phones and even Google now only updates their devices for <2 years (Samsung / streamer manufacturer's do this even less!)... We HAVE to run the likes of Lineage if we want the devices to be secure! Bye bye Netflix, even Amazon Video lets us use rooted devices! jcopernicus People don't understand IP and lambast a company protecting it. Of course. RemixedCat well they got rid of 5 star ratings, deleted tons of shows I was in the middle of, and the roku app is hella slow and takes 10 freakin minutes to load (by comparison my OS install from power on to desktop was 8 minutes on my samsung 850 500GB SSD!!) Tobi I'm running LineageOS on my Oneplus One to lengthen the lifespan of my device. Why must I be punished for that? I'm going back to pirating content. StankyChikin Possible that the movie industry is pushing this? SkullOne Shhhhh. Don't use logic here. It's not allowed. It's simply easier to blame Netflix and believe that they have a vendetta against the teeny tiny, itsy bitsy amount of root users out there! StankyChikin Forgive me plz lol username_not_valid This isnt about Netflix, its about its content providers. There is this notion that you can copy files and therefore pirate content if you are rooted. We all know its rubbish, Netflix probably knows its rubbish, but that doesn't change anything. If Netflix wants shows, its has to abide by its license agreements. There is really nothing Netflix, Amazon, Sky or any other streaming service can do about it. The fact that almost all pirate content comes from PCs and HDCP by-pass devices doesnt mean a thing. TedPhillips at least in practice, unlocking your bootloader/being rooted has no impact on your widevine support level. now, i'm not sure if the oem could supply a high-level drm library on a pre-rooted device, due to agreements, but modification after the point of sale is a different matter. meanwhile, keep on streaming netflix on your 'rooted' computer - gasp!~ Richard Markert >meanwhile, keep on streaming netflix on your 'rooted' computer - gasp!~ I don't even need an admin account to steal Netflix on my PC. Since the Windows 10 app and browsers BOTH work over analog, all I need is an inline box with a DSUB VGA connector and simply capture the entire output from the VGA port. Valerie Frye-Preter Did they do this because of the stolen season 5 of Orange is the New Black? TedPhillips wasn't that stolen before it was available for streaming? so i don't see how it could be. TedPhillips when the device can be retroactively uncertified, as safetynet mutates over time, that's a step beyond the usual forced obsolescence of artificially short software support windows. now instead of buying a new phone every 18-24 months, it could be literally whenever they feel like moving the goalposts. Mike Hunt I don't understand. I am a Netflix subscriber, but will probably have to unsubscribe now since I bought a rooted Chinese mediabox for my TV. This sucks, as I liked and supported NetFlix's business model. Richard Markert Which box do you have? Mike Hunt One of these https://www.aliexpress.com/wholesale?catId=0&initiative_id=SB_20170514131212&SearchText=media+box+mini+m8s Brock Reed I'm not even getting the "not compatible" message, it's just not showing up at all. Ajmobileguru First DirecTV Now and now Netflix. I dont see the point. As if rooted users were pirating the streams or movies. Rooted users on non-nexus/pixel devices already were getting only 480p because of widewine crap and now this. Anunnaki This is why people switch to apps like Popcorn Time and Terrarium TV. Biga173rd Popcorn time still works? Anunnaki When I last checked few months ago, it was working. No idea about the current situation though. Biga173rd Okay Erin Andrews Oh that's easy, they block my device I cancel my subscription. Say goodbye to my 15 dollars a month. piggynuts Stopped playing Pokemon, stopped using Snapchat, next to go is Netflix. I refuse to say bye to root. BobButtons Magisk. While some say it's hit and miss with Pokemon GO (idk, I don't play it) it's never not worked for me with Snapchat/Android Pay/Mario Run. cliff_dangers Why does everyone freak out about a rooted phone but my PC which is wide open is not a problem? What makes smartphones so special? Doro Manekia ΝετΦλξ Ανάθεμα σου.Χα χα χα Το Μαααακα. Bewear I am not that upset because I rarely use Netflix on my mobile, I am upset because this kind of blocking will become a trend. BoFiS ugh, fuck you, Netflix, I pay for your serve, LET ME USE IT ON MY PHONE A.M There are some many ways around that LAME NETFLIX - Showbox Kodi Firestick with Kodi I can't see the point of Netflix when we have so MANY better apps out there that kill Netflix ErectBipedal That'll teach them filthy pirates for trying to pay us money!.... wait.... -Netflix probably Zxyon Rhysivz What could users with unlocked/rooted phones do with the Netflix app that other users can't? Loco Mole Netflix content isn't that much better these days, so if they choose to distinguish themselves by being a d*ck to consumers who care about using our devices the way we want to, then f u too, Netflix, I got plenty of other legit streaming content. Fedup Let's see... Piracy: $0.00, no ads, no DRM, no device/location/time restrictions Legit: $$$, ads out the as$, DRM limiting options, shows locked to specific devices, locations, etc. Keep on making the decision easier for us, Netflix. xyz Fortunately, the Pirate Bay is accessible from all devices and regions without any geo-blocking. berserksgangr Well, my Nexus 7 with Lineage it's not working even without root (error 9) Nick Riley This is utterly stupid! Corvus Dove Remember that time that making things more difficult for software and media pirates through DRM while possibly messing with legitimate customers paid off and prevented piracy? Me either. Asbjørn The problem here is that most users root their phone to get the updates that their OEM doesn't want to make available. If Android had proper updates, rooting would not be so necessary. Patel Nisha Root user here. How do I use Magisk for this? I have it installed and new to the Magisk(haven't had a rooted phone in a while)? Keletor Does it stop you from sideloading it? I mean really, if you are rooting your phone you most likely will find a workaround. Luxferro Not yet, but you can be sure the app will stop working in the future. Znuff The download feature is not working for me anymore.

DDS This move will not stop people from pirating their content, it will encourage it. Exactly the opposite of what they're trying to achieve. But tell that to the a**hats who control the money... Ubelsteiner And thus, Plex and Kodi become even more popular, as Netflix drives a nail into it's own coffin. Znuff http://i.imgur.com/LG3dXc4.jpg http://i.imgur.com/eNeuPCD.jpg Can not use the latest version on my device, it sends me to download the 4.x version.

In the first clues of the origin of the massive ransomware attacks, Google researcher Neel Mehta posted computer code that showed similarities between the "WannaCry" malware and a vast hacking effort widely attributed to Pyongyang. Other experts quickly jumped on this as sign -- although not conclusive -- that North Korea may have been behind the outbreak. Researchers at Russia-based security firm Kaspersky said this was an important clue. "For now, more research is required into older versions of Wannacry," Kaspersky researchers said. "We believe this might hold the key to solve some of the mysteries around this attack. One thing is for sure -- Neel Mehta's discovery is the most significant clue to date regarding the origins of Wannacry." According to Kaspersky, the similarities in code point to a hacker group given the code-name Lazarus, believed to be behind the 2014 hack of Sony Pictures and also suspected in hacks against the central bank of Bangladesh and others in the global financial system. "The scale of the Lazarus operations is shocking," Kaspersky researchers said. "The group has been very active since 2011... Lazarus is operating a malware factory that produces new samples via multiple independent conveyors." Israeli-based security firm Intezer Labs said it agreed with the North Korea attribution. The group's chief executive Itai Tevet said in a tweet: "@IntezerLabs confirms attribution to North Korea for #WannaCry, not only because of the function from Lazarus. More info to come."

The New York Times reported Sunday that Google-owned Waymo, the self-driving car project that emerged from the secret Google X labs, is partnering with the distant second-place rideshare service Lyft to pair Lyft’s customer base with Waymo’s technology in hopes of driving Uber’s autonomous vehicle aspirations off the road. Waymo hopes to beat Uber in the self-driving car game the old fashioned way — by suing them — and got some great breaking news Monday morning on that front. In the Waymo vs. Uber lawsuit in which Google/Waymo/Alphabet claims that Uber stole much of their top-secret driverless car technology, a federal judge has ruled that Uber must return all 14,000 allegedly stolen documents to Google, and that poached Google executive Anthony Levandowski may no longer work on Uber's self-driving car projects. (The ruling actually came down last week, along with a separate one seeking the US Attorney's involvement in a potential criminal probe, but it was unsealed this morning.) In a blistering court order republished by Ars Technica, Judge William Alsup ruled that Uber “likely knew or at least should have known” that Levandowski had stolen the enormous trove of Google internal documents, and that Uber must do “whatever it can to ensure that its employees return 14,000-plus pilfered files to their rightful owner.” Levandowski has pled the Fifth plus he took a job with Uber, so the court of public opinion is already leaning heavily against him. Levandowski stepped down from his executive role last month, but up until now he was still working within the self-driving vehicle realm at the company. In the battle outside the courts, Waymo’s partnership with Lyft is seen as a significant inroad against Uber for both parties. Lyft has the enormous database of riders that Waymo lacks, while Waymo has the self-driving car technology that Lyft would need to compete against Uber in the near future when human beings no longer know how to drive. Indeed, Waymo has already unleashed self-driving minivans on the streets of Mountain View, and the DMV recently eased regulations on the testing of self-driving vehicles. Waymo has aspiration to deploy their fleet of self-driving cars here in this calendar year of 2017, and their partnership with Lyft indicates this concept could go from beta-testing to moneymaking much sooner than any of us thought. If the Google-owned Waymo is able to keep Uber’s rollout self-driving cars tied up in court, they’re likely in the fast lane to be first to market with commercially viable robot vehicles.

While new versions of iOS, first and foremost, typically roll out to everyone at the same time, that’s not exactly the case when it comes to Android updates, which roll out on separate dates depending on the device or mobile carrier, and tend to be pushed out in “phases,” meaning some users may get the new software days before others do. This phenomenon of fragmentation has frustrated Android device owners for quite some time, but Google hopes to take some steps to change this with its new initiative, Project Treble. In a blog post shared earlier this week on Google’s official Android Developers site, Project Treble team lead Iliyan Malchev offered a quick advance look at the new project, which is hyped up as being the biggest change to date to the Android operating system’s low-level system architecture. With an infographic explaining how the average Android update is fleshed out before getting rolled out to users, Malchev explained that there are five steps in this process, starting with the release of the update’s open-source code, and ending with the testing, certification, and eventual release of the new software. Perhaps a beginning to the slow process of creating better Android updates https://t.co/W62jQqfg8g — Ars Technica (@arstechnica) May 14, 2017 According to Google’s blog post, Project Treble is a “re-architecting” of the Android operating system as we know it, one that would result in a more affordable, simpler, and faster way for original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to roll out new Android updates to their users. Based on how it’s described, Project Treble looks like a potential game-changer and an instant solution to the myriad of update issues Android users have to go through. Thanks to its “stable” vendor interface, OEMs only need to update the Android OS framework without having to get input from silicon manufacturers, should they be ready to roll out an update to device owners. That, as well as the new vendor interface itself, is going to be a byproduct of the project’s main feature — the isolation of device-specific vendor implementation from Android’s framework. However, a report from Ars Technica suggests that Android users shouldn’t set their expectations too high — Project Treble can theoretically make Android updates roll out faster, but there are a lot of variables that could come into play, starting with OEMs tendencies to add their own user interfaces/experiences (UI/UX) on top of stock Android. With companies like Samsung known for changing the entire Android UI and adding their own special software features, it would seem that Project Treble doesn’t reduce the amount of work Android OEMs need to, or would want to do, when it comes to software updates. Companies such as Samsung tend to add a ton of features on top of stock, or vanilla Android software. [Image by Brad Barket/Getty Images for Samsung] There’s also the problem of motivation, as Ars Technica described it. Just how willing would OEMs and carriers be to break the cycle and start rolling out updates sooner, or to make sure everybody gets their updates at the same time instead of the software rolling out in “phases” or “stages”? “OEMs and carriers will still be a roadblock in the way of updates, and they are still free to drag their feet when it comes to updating older models.” Google explained that its partner OEMs tend to take a while when rolling out Android updates for older devices because it is often time-consuming and expensive to do so. This business implication — a “negative effect on companies’ bottom lines,” according to Ars Technica — often results in OEMs taking their sweet time when it comes to new versions of Android. Those hoping to have this new, hopefully smoother Android update process take effect on their existing devices may have to wait, as it still isn’t sure if, when, or how Project Treble will be available on older phones or tablets. Google says Project Treble will be available on all new devices with Google’s upcoming “Android O” platform and beyond, with its architecture found on Android O’s Developer Preview for Pixel phones.

The latest round in the Uber vs Google fight has seen a top engineer at Uber ordered by a US judge to stop work on key self-driving car technology. Embattled engineer Anthony Levandowski must be removed from any work relating to LiDAR, a key technology involved in self-driving cars, following a legal suit filed against Uber by rival Waymo. Waymo, the self-driving car unit of Google parent Alphabet, claims that Uber is using key parts of Waymo’s self-driving tech. Levandowski is at the centre of this legal fight, with the engineer having been involved with Google’s self-driving car project before leaving to start Otto, a company which was later acquired by Uber. Waymo claims that Levandowski stole documents from Alphabet, in addition to alleging that the engineer was already in talks with Uber before he left Alphabet. The injunction barring Levandowski from working on LiDAR is part of an order which was revealed in sealed documents last week. Although Levandowski has said that he will not undertake any work relating to the disputed technology LiDAR, which revolves around sensors, an Uber engineer recently testified that Levandowski communicates with the company’s self-driving boss on a daily basis. READ MORE: Waymo self-driving tests with public, whilst Uber trial rages on The order also denied Uber’s request to move the lawsuit into private arbitration and referred the case to the US attorney general. While Levandowski has been barred from working on self-driving tech, Uber has been allowed to continue its work on LiDAR development.

By Avi Salzman May 15, 2017 1:57 p.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large YouTube is still working to regain the trust of advertisers who fled after reports that their ads were seen with inappropriate content. Photo: Getty Images About two months ago, several major companies pulled their ads from Google-owned YouTube after reports that the ads were being shown alongside extremist content from hate groups and terrorists. Among the companies that stopped advertising were behemoths like General Motors, Wal-Mart, and Pepsico. Some also pulled ads from the Google Display Network, which places ads on millions of other websites. Investors worried about the issue for a few days and then moved on, assuaged by comments from Google CEO Sundar Pichai that the company had the issue under control. He said Google is using improved technologies, including machine learning, to better enforce its policies for keeping ads away from problematic content: “advertisers have clearly noticed all the improvements we have made.” Analysts signalled the all-clear -- “we believe large brand advertisers are increasingly coming back to the platform, suggesting minimal disruption to monetization growth at YouTube, in our view,” JMP Securities analyst Ronald Josey wrote in April. The stock has also shrugged it off. Alphabet, the company that owns Google, has risen 14% in just the past month. But Barron’s Next reached out to a dozen companies that had reportedly pulled their ads from YouTube and/or the Google Display Network and found that several major advertisers have yet to return: Wal-Mart still won’t run ads on YouTube, a Wal-Mart spokesperson wrote, but declined to explain further. Verizon continues to suspend its ads as it works with its digital ad partners to “understand the weak links.” Nestle has also “pause[d] our media buying with Google/YouTube pending reassurances from them on actions to address the problem of brand advertising appearing on inappropriate websites.” Toyota will only run ads on channels where they can direct placement, such as Buzzfeed and Discovery, although they remain in “active discussions to reach an acceptable resolution” for further advertising, Toyota said in a statement. Some big companies have been convinced that Google is on top of it, or are working with ad agencies to make sure they’re protected. Johnson & Johnson has resumed advertising “in a number of select countries,” including the U.S. after Google instituted “brand protections.” Enterprise Holdings, which owns Enterprise, Alamo, and National car-rental companies, last week said it plans to resume advertising “in the next week or so” following talks with Google. Its media agency Omnicom is also working on a program called Supply Accreditation through Filtering and Evaluation (SAFE) where it will “score” videos to determine if they’re advertiser-friendly. Enterprise will be helping test the program, the spokesperson wrote. Google hasn’t quantified how many advertisers left, and didn’t answer our question about how many have returned. “Many advertisers never left and many have decided to come back,” a spokesperson wrote. “While they know that no system can be perfect, they appreciate the actions we’ve taken and know we are taking this seriously and are committed to getting better and better.” More from Barron’s Next Facebook, Tesla Realize Technology Can’t Solve Everything Google’s Latest Foe: The U.S. Government This YouTube Meltdown Comes at a Particularly Bad Time Text Size Regular Medium Large Avi Salzman avi.salzman@barrons.com • @avibarrons Most Popular Lulu’s Problem Is Black and White The Best Day to Buy Airline Tickets Is Starbucks Ready to Heat Up Again?

An equivalent scenario with conventional weapons would be the U.S. military having some of its Tomahawk missiles stolen," wrote Brad Smith, president and chief legal officer at Microsoft, on a company blog Sunday evening. Ransomware is a type of cyberattack that encrypts a target's files, with the attacker providing the decryption key only after a ransom is paid, usually in bitcoin. ADVERTISEMENT WanaDecrypt0r, alternately known by names like Wanna Cry, has struck hundreds of thousands of computers in more than 100 nations since the attack began Friday morning. Victims range from hospitals in the United Kingdom, a telecom company in Spain, U.S.-based FedEx, and the Russian Ministry of the Interior. WanaDecrypt0r was so virulent in part because it used a Windows hacking tool that appears to have been stolen from the NSA and leaked by a hacking group known as the Shadow Brokers. Though Microsoft had patched the security hole in Windows, businesses often lag in installing updates for reasons including industry-specific software being incompatible with the most current version of operating systems. "In February [we called] for a new 'Digital Geneva Convention' to govern these issues, including a new requirement for governments to report vulnerabilities to vendors, rather than stockpile, sell, or exploit them," wrote Smith. By reporting bugs instead of using them to conduct cyber espionage, manufacturers would be able to increase cybersecurity for all of its users -- but that would come at the cost of intelligence and sabotage operations. Read more here, from our cybersecurity colleague Joe Uchill.   MORE ON WANNA CRY: Edward Snowden called the continuing "ransomware" scourge "a perfect storm of all the problems everyone has been warning about" at a privacy issues conference Monday. Russian President Vladimir Putin used the ransomware attack to deliver a jab at the U.S. Monday was the most lucrative day yet for the Wanna Cry ransomware. President Trump reportedly ordered an emergency meeting over the weekend to address the threat.   Please send your tips, comments and constructive criticism to Ali Breland (abreland@thehill.com) and Harper Neidig (hneidig@thehill.com) and follow us on Twitter: @alibreland, @hneidig and @HilliconValley.

Waymo alleges that a former employee, Anthony Levandowski, stole about 14,000 documents -- including trade secrets -- before leaving to start a self-driving truck company called Otto. Uber later acquired Otto, gaining access to the files. Uber has until May 31 to return the files to Waymo, U.S. District Judge William Alsup ordered. The documents allegedly detail advancements Waymo had made with lidar -- a radar system that most self-driving car companies to employ help their cars pilot themselves.

Its Congressional Budget Office score came in on Friday, with the CBO estimating the plan to update government technology and IT systems would cost around $500 million over the next five years. The bill is set to hit the House floor on Wednesday. After President Donald TrumpDonald TrumpState Dept. surprised by Tillerson defending Trump: report GOP strategist: GOP would have 'rightly' tried to impeach Clinton for classified disclosure Pelosi: 'What do the Russians have on Donald Trump?' MORE's Cybersecurity executive order last week, technology and cyber interests praised the order, but said that a plan for updating the federal government's technology is necessary to protect the U.S. from cyber threats. Many see Hurd's bill as the answer. For more on the CBO score, click here. For more on the upcoming votes on Hurd's legislation and another bill to help combat cyber crime, click here.   SPICER TALKS APPLE: White House press secretary Sean Spicer praised Apple during Monday's White House Press Briefing, citing it as an example of a company that is investing in the U.S. "The president is also very glad to see businesses once again making significant investments in America, from Intel to General Motors to Walmart to Apple, who specifically just announced earlier this month that they'll start a $1 billion fund to promote manufacturing jobs here in the United States," Spicer said. He called the hiring push an example of "the president's domestic economic policies that are generating optimism." Unlike many other companies who have announced hiring pushes recently, Apple did not tie its announcement to Trump or his policies.   JOHN OLIVER ADDRESS FCC COMMENTERS: HBO comedian John Oliver on Sunday again rallied his viewers to submit pro-net neutrality comments to the Federal Communications Commission, but took a shot at those who had been using the site to launch personal attacks against the FCC's GOP chairman. Supporters of Ajit Pai, who has kicked off proceedings to roll back Obama-era net neutrality protections, have been quick to seize on inflammatory comments filed in the past week, after Oliver urged his audience to show support for the regulations. And on Sunday, Oliver acknowledged in a YouTube video that there were racist comments filed in support of net neutrality and had a simple message for any of his viewers who may have written them: "Stop it. Do not f---ing do that." "Writing racist things on the internet is not how you win the net neutrality debate," Oliver said. "It's how you win the presidency."

The agency has launched a new effort, dubbed Operation Tech Trap, to end online scams where customers are tricked into believing their computers are infected with a virus and that they must pay a third party to solve the issue. The fraud involves scammers running deceptive pop-up ads that look like security alerts from Apple or Microsoft. The alerts falsely warn users that their computers are infected with a virus and that if they close the warning, the contents of their hard drive will be deleted. The ads provide a phone number to call, which promises to fix the nonexistent virus.

The partnership, which was first reported by The New York Times, comes as the race heats up to get driverless cars on the road. "We're looking forward to working with Lyft to explore new self-driving products that will make our roads safer and transportation more accessible," said a spokesman for Waymo, Google's driverless car company. "Lyft's vision and commitment to improving the way cities move will help Waymo's self-driving technology reach more people, in more places."

Android Auto is coming to even more cars. Image: volvo/google By Brett Williams2017-05-15 16:49:27 UTC Android is coming to your car — and you won't even need to bring your phone along for the ride.  A year after Google teased the experience, Android-powered car infotainment systems are much closer to reality. Full Android integration is a step beyond Android Auto, where users can project car-specific versions of apps (like Maps) to a dashboard running some other software; now Android powers the entire system. The first two carmakers to show off Android-powered cars are Audi and Volvo, and at least one of concept vehicle — Audi's flashy R8 sport — will be on display at this week's Google I/O developers conference. SEE ALSO: Lyft teams with Google's Waymo for self-driving cars The deeper Android integration means more Android's features — such as Google's voice-activated Assistant — will run natively on dashboards. Beyond the usual Android Auto fare of Spotify and Google Maps, you could also use voice to control things like your sunroof or air conditioning. A closer look at the infotainment system of an Android-powered Volvo. Image: Google/volvo Volvo's Android integration will arrive in new models "within two years," according to a company release about the partnership. Henrik Green, Volvo's Senior Vice President of Research & Development, said the system will offer "hundreds of popular apps," and the automaker will also work with Google to add location-based Google Local Search to its cars.  The details of the Audi partnership are less specific, with the automaker touting the Android platform's potential for future development of new apps and connected auto services. The deals with Audi and Volvo put Android another step ahead of competitor Apple in the connected car space. Although Apple has CarPlay, which competes directly with Android Auto, there are no stated plans for car infotainment systems that run iOS. (That could change at Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in June.) Of course, there are other smart systems out there running apps, too — Ford Sync (which runs BlackBerry-owned QNX software) offers third-party apps like Siri and even the Android Auto app through AppLink. Microsoft is also looking to make big moves with its Azure-powered Connected Vehicle Platform. However, Google's Android-powered systems could be a game-changer as it leverages the strength of the sizable Android development community.  WATCH: I tried a self-driving car in London and lived to tell the tale Topics: Android, android auto, Apps and Software, audi, CarPlay, Google, Google I/O, Tech, Transportation, volvo About Us Jobs Advertise Subscribe Privacy Terms Mashable is a global, multi-platform media and entertainment company.

Image: Shutterstock / Africa Studio By Freia Lobo2017-05-15 19:59:45 UTC After teaching AI to draw and paint with AutoDraw, Google has set its sight on conquering another art form: music The company's AI research team, Google Magenta, announced a new project in April called Neural Synthesizer, or NSynth, which generates audio using deep neural networks. That technology will be demonstrated at Durham, North Carolina's annual arts and technology festival, Moogfest, later this week. SEE ALSO: Google's new AutoDraw wants to make drawing easier for everyone To create music, NSynth uses a dataset containing sounds from individual instruments and then blends them to create hybrid sounds. According to the company, NSynth gives "artists with intuitive control over timbre and dynamics and the ability to explore new sounds that would be difficult or impossible to produce with a hand-tuned synthesizer," the company said in their announcement. The resulting sound is not like playing two of the individual sounds together, Cinjon Resnick, a member of the Magenta team told Wired. Instead, the software is actually producing an entirely new sound that would be impossible or nearly impossible to do so otherwise. The end product resembles sounds that are "in between" other instruments, combined in a way that can only be done digitally.  The code for the project is open source, which means that anyone can download, modify and use it. The Magenta team has already produced several interesting pieces of music, one of which even one best demo at NIPS, an industry conference for neural networks and machine learning projects. Several other systems like IBM's Watson have been working on similar projects for music made by or with AI. For now, Google itself is not offering the software as a product, NSynth is meant to be a dataset for other developers to play with and try creative projects.  But don't worry, Google is not trying get rid of human musicians with NSynth. The team is focused on making new sounds that are "intuitive" and "expressive," and want to work with musicians rather than replace them.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Cars TECH Android Apple Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable MORE Entertainment Science Health Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Cars Tech   Android Apple Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable More   Entertainment Science Health Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search Google IO 2017: what to watch for and how Chris Burns - May 15, 2017 0 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Today we’re running down what’s coming to Google IO 2017, the company’s annual software conference aimed at developers. This event takes place on May 17th, 18th, and 19th of May – that’s Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday of this week. We’ll be at the event series to get up-close-and-personal photos, video, and any hands-on bits that can be had. For everything else, there’s streaming video. Google separates their Google IO schedule up into Tracks, Themes, Types, and Locations. The last two items there are inconsequential for everyone that’s not physically at the event. Themes for this three day set of events include Beyond Mobile, Building on Mobile, Platforms, and “Grow & Earn.” Tracks at Google IO 2017 include: • Accessibility • Ads • Android • Assistant • Cloud • Design • Firebase • IoT • Location & Maps • Machine Learning & AI • Misc • Mobile Web • Play • Search • VR Chrome Noticeably absent from the list is “Chrome” – though that hasn’t really been a big theme at Google IO for a few years. That doesn’t mean that Chrome does not exist, just that there aren’t enough items in the schedule to create a full “Track” as such. Chrome is relegated to events like “Office Hours with the Chrome, Polymer, and Web team” – which takes place once each day for all three days. There is one event that works with Chrome that’s separate from office hours. That is “Android apps for Chromebooks and large screen devices.” That session includes “improving an app’s ability to provide better window management and implement different hardware inputs (trackpad, mouse, keyboard, and stylus) as frequently used with larger screen devices.” This session takes place on May 19th at 12:30 PM (Pacific Time) on Stage 5 – and will be streamed. Android The main keynote takes place at 10AM on the 17th in the Amphitheatre – that’ll be with Google CEO Sundar Pichai. Android O is on the way and – outside the initial keynote – we’ll see what’s going on starting in a session about what’s new. It’s called “What’s New in Android” and it takes place on May 17th at 2PM in the Amphitheare. Probably the most interesting session on Android that’ll take place outside the initial keynote is the “Android Fireside Chat.” This session will take place on the 18th at 6:30PM and will feature a key team of Google’s Android developers. This team will include Rachel Garb, Tim Murray, Chet Haase, Dan Sandler, Dianne Hackborn, Adam Powell, Wale Ogunwale, Tor Norbye, Ben Poiesz, Xiaowen Xin, Brian Carlstrom, Dave Burke, and Rachad Alao. As it suggests in the event listing, Google will have “engineers from the Android framework, runtime, media, graphics, and other Android teams onstage, eager to hear your innermost quandaries.” This Android Fireside Chat will take place on May 18th, 2017. It’ll take place on Stage 2. Android Auto There’ll be some significant amount of Android Auto business going on. “Assisting the Driver: From Android Phones to Android Cars” takes place on May 17th at 2PM on Stage 1. See our feature about Volvo and Audi for a primer on what’s going to be at IO. Android Things / Android Auto While it’s not spoken about all that extensively outside of developer circles, there IS such a thing as “Android Things.” That is Google’s latest effort in the Internet of Things space (IoT) and it’s been in the works in public since December of 2016. The main session on IoT for Android is “Bringing Device Production to Everyone with Android Things” and it takes place on the 17th at 4PM on Stage 3. There’ll be a little bit of Android Wear for those users wearing their software on their wrist. That’ll be “Android Wear: What’s new & Best Practices” taking place at 9:30AM on the 18th on Stage 1. Another Android Things session takes place that same hour on Stage 5. Android Instant Apps Though I’m still not completely convinced Android Instant Apps are anything other than webpages by a different name, it does appear that Google is doing more work in this space. “Android Instant Apps evolves Android apps to be able to run instantly, without requiring installation. The goal is to eliminate the friction associated with the discovery, installation and use of native Android apps, while maintaining the things that make them great. ” The session “Introduction to Android Instant Apps” will be taking place on May 18th at 1:30PM on Stage 2. This session – like the rest mentioned with times and places above – will be streamed for the public. Wrap-up We do not expect there to be a whole lot of chat about Google’s Tango. We also do not expect a whole lot of out-of-the-ordinary news about Google Daydream – nothing interesting to anyone but a developer, that is. The good news there is that their main focus, as they put it, is to “make awesome easy” for users of VR and AR in the near future. Developers will also want to tune in for the Developer Keynote. The main Developer Keynote (different from the day 1 keynote) will take place at 1PM on May 17th in the Amphitheatre. That, like the rest of the items above (except where noted) will be streamed through the Google Developers YouTube Account as well as through our big Streaming Event page in our Android hub coming immediately if not soon!

(Fiat Chrysler Automobiles) BY Kyle Campbell NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Monday, May 15, 2017, 4:54 PM A U.S. District Court judge ordered Uber to return secret files stolen from Waymo, Google’ autonomous driving subsidiary and one of the company’s biggest competitors, according to a decision released Monday. The files in question contain information about self-driving technology that Waymo claims a former employee absconded with last year. Adding insult to injury, Waymo also inked a deal the same day to share its autonomous technology with Uber’s other big rival, Lyft, according to Reuters. FOLLOW DAILY NEWS AUTOS ON FACEBOOK. ‘LIKE’ US HERE. Waymo, which is owned by Google parent company Alphabet Inc., claims one of its former engineers stole intellectual property from the company when he left in January 2016 and funneled it into Uber’s Lidar system. Upon leaving Alphabet Inc., that engineer, Anthony Levandowski, helped found Otto, an autonomous trucking company that would later be purchased by Uber. Waymo claims Uber stole confidential information about its Lidar software. (AFP/Getty Images) Judge William Alsup of San Francisco wrote the Uber either knew or should have known that Levandowski had taken more than 14,000 confidential files from Waymo. He thus ordered Uber to return the files and prohibited Levandowski, the one-time leader of Uber’s self-driving research team, from doing any further work on Lidar, a light-based sensor system used to guide autonomous vehicles. However, Alsup also ruled that few Waymo trade secrets can be traced to Uber’s self-driving technology and the patent claims against Uber were “meritless,” because some of the technology was industry common knowledge. The decision revealed Monday will not prevent Uber from developing autonomous technology. “We are pleased with the court's ruling that Uber can continue building and utilizing all of its self-driving technology, including our innovation around Lidar,” Uber said in an emailed statement Monday. “We look forward to moving toward trial and continuing to demonstrate that our technology has been built independently from the ground up." Lyft could end up the big winner in the clash between Uber and Lyft. (Kelly Sullivan) While both sides had their wins in court, Waymo took the upper hand outside of it by forging a partnership with Lyft, the other big name in the ride-hailing business. In addition to upstaging Uber, this partnership gives Waymo an opportunity to test its automation system in a real-world setting while providing Lyft with a second source for autonomous technology. Unlike Uber, Lyft is reliant on its other partner, General Motors, for all of its self-driving technology. Tags: auto news Did you find this article helpful?

If you haven’t tried Assistant yet, you really are missing out. Google Assistant allows you to carry out actions, schedule meetings, and even query information just by talking to your Android device or Google Home. Google Assistant allows you to interact with your phone and devices completely hands-free. If you’re the type of person who is always at odds with your schedule, don’t worry — Google Assistant is definitely for you. Here are just a few ways you can use Google Assistant to make your busy day easier. 1. Create a grocery or shopping list Google Keep is an excellent note-taking and reminder app for Android devices that meshes well with Google Assistant. Make sure you have that app installed before creating a shopping list. To add something new to a list, say “Add X to my shopping list,” and the assistant will do so through Keep. If you have the new Home app, it may use that instead. The list will remain separate, and, as you tell the assistant about new items, it will add them to it. When you ask “What’s on my shopping list?,” Google will call out all the items you have listed or display them on screen. Unfortunately, you can’t do any advanced editing by voice yet, even just removing items, so you’ll have to save that action for when you have your hands free. 2. Check your flight schedule From most home screens, you can swipe left on the last panel to open the Google Home Knowledge Graph. It shows up when you open Google Home. Scroll down to see your information cards. The Knowledge Graph is used to show a variety of personal information that pertains to you and your schedule. For instance, it might show recent scores of your favorite sports teams, an upcoming meeting, or an invoice for a recent order. It can also show you flight information for an upcoming flight. But you might be surprised to know you can talk to the Google Assistant about these cards. For example, you could ask “Where is Flight X right now?” Google will let you know if your flight is on time or delayed. You can ask just about any question related to that flight listing, like what time your flight takes off, what time you’re expected to land, and more. 3. Perform conversions on the fly Want to know how many tablespoons in a cup? What about the exchange rate of 6,000 Indian Rupees to U.S. dollars? All you have to do is ask the Google Assistant, and it will read the answers to you. You can even ask for language translations, like how to say “beer” in Spanish or “thank you” in Hindi. 4. Get traffic updates When you follow a specific route for your commute — or have Google Maps open for navigation — you can have Google Assistant call out traffic updates relevant to you. There are many ways to do this, the most obvious of which is to ask how long it will take you to get somewhere. 5. Control smart home tech Is your home outfitted with smart bulbs, thermostats, or locks? You can control a variety of IoT and smart devices with Google Assistant. Just navigate to the settings menu in the Google app and choose the Home Control option. Select which devices Google Assistant has the power to interface with by adding various apps. For example, you can add Nest or Wink to open up access to all your hub-connected devices. You can parse out your devices by room or area, and then you simply call out commands based on a particular room. For instance, you can include your smart TV, smart light, smart switch, and alarm system in the living room. When you ask Google Assistant to “activate” the room, it will do what you’ve set that to be. Another scenario would be to ask Google to turn off all the lights in a specific room. How convenient is that? 6. Enable or disable phone settings Hands full and don’t have the ability to change the brightness of your display? Want to mute incoming notifications and calls? How about turning on your flashlight so you can see in the dark? These are all things you can do simply by talking to Google Assistant. Go to the What Can I Do section in Google settings to get a better idea of some of the things Assistant can do with the Android settings menu. Is there a command you could really use in your day-to-day that isn’t discussed here? No worries — just use the OK Google website to see if that command is available to use with Assistant.

Galaxy S8 and S8+ review: Another pair of excellent mainstream smartphones from Samsung David Ruddock Follow View All Posts 2017/04/18 7:59am PDTApr 18, 2017 22 Plus 1 on G+ 107 Share on Facebook 76 Share on Twitter Total Shares205 Galaxy S8 Galaxy S8+ News Phone Reviews Article Contents 1 The Good 2 The Not So Good 3 Design and materials 4 Display 5 Battery life and charging 6 Storage, wireless, and call quality 7 Audio and speakers 8 Camera 9 Performance 10 Testing notes 11 Software 11.1 What's new 11.1.1 Navigation keys 11.1.2 Bixby 11.1.3 Snap window 11.1.4 Dual audio 11.1.5 Separate app sound 11.1.6 Other changes 11.2 General UI (launcher, notifications, lockscreen, navigation keys) 11.3 Software: Opinion 12 Value 13 Conclusion When you talk about Samsung's Galaxy smartphones, it's hard not to talk about 'the average consumer.' Because the Galaxy S series is the second-most popular line of smartphones on earth, its audience is unashamedly mainstream, and the vast majority of sales of these devices will be to consumers who aren't what you'd call tech-savvy. The issue for Samsung, increasingly, is learning how to split the difference between a smartphone that provides a good experience for everybody and maintaining that all important credibility with its fans and enthusiasts. The Galaxy S8 and S8+, for example, have Quad HD displays - the best ones I've ever seen. But they're set to 1080p by default for improved performance. And as enthusiasts clamor for ever-larger batteries, Samsung has put very average, if not exactly small, ones in these new phones (though they should degrade less noticeably). The S8 is still a slippery metal and glass sandwich that essentially requires additional protection unless you like to live life on the edge, which is great news for case manufacturers, but less so for you and me. And then there's the new fingerprint scanner, which is just a bit tragic (especially on the S8+). Of course, there are big upsides: the latest chipset from Qualcomm, the Snapdragon 835, ensures that the Galaxy S8 will probably have the best LTE performance of any phone on the market here in the US. That chip also brings features like Bluetooth 5.0, improved Wi-Fi performance, and better image signal processors for the cameras. Samsung's Infinity Display is genuinely breathtaking: this is the best screen I've seen on a smartphone, period. The rear-facing camera is still great, the quality of the phone itself seems almost unimpeachable, and Samsung continues to make legitimate value-adds to the smartphone experience with features like Samsung Pay, wireless charging, and advanced network feature support across all four major US carriers. The fact that you can just walk in to a store and buy one generally speaking (ahem, Google) is something worth pointing out, too. Samsung's ubiquity is absolutely a product feature. Like the S7 and S7 edge last year, the S8 and S8+ feel iterative - in a good way. But I also believe they're evidence that what makes a smartphone "great" is becoming more and more subjective. These are great smartphones, but how great really depends a lot on your priorities. The Good Display The best displays I've ever seen on a smartphone. They're bright, they're beautiful, they have excellent viewing angles, and tiny little bezels. You get a ton of screen in a remarkably compact package. Battery I only tested the S8+ in depth, but the battery life on this phone was great. If you disable the always-on display, it gets even better. Camera While I still prefer the Pixel's camera, the S8's has its own strengths, including excellent low-light performance, fast captures, and bright, vivid colors. GraceUX isn't bad TouchWiz has come a long way. Setting aside the conversation about updates, I find GraceUX perfectly good, and Samsung has genuine value-adds in the software these days. Virtual keys FINALLY. Samsung has entered the modern Android era and given us virtual navigation keys. It has noticeably improved my feelings about using a Samsung phone. The Not So Good Fingerprint scanner I actively hate the fingerprint scanner on the S8+. It may be better on the standard S8. But yeah, it's bad. Updates The S8 and S8+ ship with Android 7.0, and I've seen exactly nothing from Samsung indicating they plan to change their attitude about timely Android platform updates. Bixby Is utterly worthless. A waste of a perfectly good hardware key. So much glass I would seriously worry about breaking this phone if I bought it. There is so much glass - Samsung phones essentially require cases. Pricey At $750 and $850 for the S8 and S8+, respectively, there's no denying Samsung is asking a lot for the privilege of joining the Galaxy S club this year. Design and materials Not all glass and metal sandwiches are created equal. With the S8 and S8+, Samsung has proven once again that, yes, there is still room for refinement when it comes to packaging and polishing a smartphone. To call these phones "pretty" would be to do them a disservice (I also don't necessarily think it's true). They have an almost precious quality to them, something that tends to be strongly evoked when you hold them in the slightly awkward "claw" grip a curved-edge smartphone sort of requires. But the phones look and feel so solid - their seams so uniform and tight - that you get the sense they can't even be taken apart, because they must have been forged whole in some kind of dark ritual (especially in this black finish). I don't mean to fawn, but when you compare Samsung's industrial design here on the S8+ to something like the Google Pixel XL, the Pixel looks and feels like yesterday's smartphone. And I don't just mean the bezels. Compare it to the Galaxy S7 edge, and the new S8+ is clearly a more moderate step forward, though. The biggest change is of course the display, which we will get to soon, but let's talk about those bezels. Samsung hasn't made what you'd call a "bezelless" phone (no one has), but their bezel reduction approach is more similar to LG's than, say, Xiaomi's. Instead of making the ludicrous compromise of moving the front-facing camera and various sensors down to the chin of the phone and messing with the earpiece speaker just to achieve that not-bezelless look, Samsung's chopped off some bezel on both the top and bottom. The result is much more screen in a package that doesn't need to grow dramatically to accommodate it. This is the smart approach to maximizing screen-to-body ratio (conversely, I would argue the Xiaomi approach is not smart). The one compromise Samsung had to make was the home button - it was time for it to go. We'll talk more about the software keys later, but for those of you who liked to tap the home key to quickly check your notifications, be at ease: it has a replacement. The pressure-sensitive, always-on virtual home key can be configured to wake the screen on a double tap or long press for quick glances. As you know, this also means the fingerprint scanner had to be put... somewhere else. Samsung hasn't chosen well. The fingerprint scanner on the Galaxy S8+, in particular, is nothing short of a bad experience. My success rate on reads hovers around 50% at the time of this writing, and it's become a frustration so constant that I've started to feel a bit annoyed by the whole thing. Why couldn't it have gone in a more natural, isolated location below the camera sensor? It's not just the reach - the scanner itself is incredibly finicky about making sure the whole sensor area is covered, and sometimes just doesn't recognize my finger is on it at all. This is not to mention that said scanner is right next to the camera, which has the same sort of raised edge design as the scanner and feels exactly the same to your finger. Unlocking the S8+ with your right hand requires immense discipline and active attention to how you grasp the phone. It isn't even worth the trouble (my fingers are pretty long, by the way). With your left, it's doable as you build up the muscle memory instead of having to actively feel out the scanner. But I use a lot of phones, and this is hands down the worst fingerprint scanner I have used since Samsung's old swipe-to-read ones. It boggles my mind how far backward Samsung has gone with this experience. Even the registration process is annoying: it refused to read any of my attempts to register the sides and edges of my finger because the scanner wasn't completely covered. Anyway, that's my fingerprint scanner rant. Samsung, you messed this up. On the bottom of the phone you'll find the 3.5mm headphone jack, a USB 3.0 Type C port, the microphone, and the outlet for the speaker. The design of the power key is unchanged, but Samsung has switched back to a rocker for the volume key to avoid confusion with the new Bixby button. The buttons all provide good feedback and have a nice, clicky feel. I will say the volume rocker is a bit high up on the S8+, presumably in order to make room for said Bixby key. Out back, the camera hump is gone, meaning you can tap away at the S8 sitting on a flat surface and it won't rock or wobble (at least, not significantly). To the right of the sensor is the fingerprint scanner, and to the left is the flash and Samsung's weirdly persistent heart-rate monitor. On the front, things have become substantially more subdued with this generation of phone. The earpiece speaker is much smaller, the Samsung logo is nowhere to be found (a victory, I would say), and there's no chroming or accents around any of the sensors or front-facing camera. All colors of the Galaxy S8 have black bezels around the screen, so no matter which shade you choose, you'll get a pretty stealthy fascia. Undoubtedly, some of you are coming into this review with a question: S8 or S8+? If you're currently using a Galaxy Note5, S6 edge+, or S7 edge, I would actually advise you to consider the S8 over the larger model I'm testing here. The S8+ is a big phone - as tall as a Nexus 6, if not nearly as wide. This will make pocketability a genuine question for some, especially if you're going to be throwing a case on this big, expensive slab of metal and glass. If you typically find yourself liking a 5.5-5.7" smartphone, I'd say go for the regular S8. But if you do want something bigger, the S8+ offers a ton of screen in a package that is a lot easier to handle than phablets (sorry, sorry) of the past. Because all of the extra display area is packaged vertically, the phone is still very narrow and easy to manage with one hand - for most tasks. Reaching the top of the screen can be a real bear, and that can mean risky maneuvers (i.e., potentially dropping it) to access certain parts of the UI one-handed. I still think it's way easier to manipulate than my old Nexus 6, though. The comparative narrowness makes my grip on it a lot more confidence-inspiring, even if those stretches for the notification bar can feel a bit dicey. And because I wasn't sure where else to put it: Yes, the multi-color notification LED is still there. Even with the reduced bezel, Samsung managed to hold on to it. Display If you're sick and tired of hearing every year that "Samsung has done it again - the best smartphone display ever!" then I am sorry, you will continue to be sick and tired. The Galaxy S8 and S8+ have the best smartphone screens. Ever. They get extremely bright, the colors are exceptionally vivid (or accurate, if you switch to the Basic display mode), viewing angles are excellent, blacks are very deep, and the AMOLED panel can get ultra-dim for those late-night reading sessions. Samsung continues to demonstrate that its Super AMOLED technology is the gold standard for displays with the Galaxy S8, and that the bar can still be raised higher yet. I'm always impressed with Samsung's ability to iterate this technology with such consistent success. While this is a Quad HD panel with a native resolution of 2960x1440 (that's a lot of pixels), Samsung configures the S8 and S8+ out of the box to run at 1080p (2220x1080). Why? Because it improves performance. And that feels like something of a copout, doesn't it? Google can run the Pixel XL with its older, less efficient Snapdragon 821 chip at full QHD resolution and achieve performance and battery life that go toe-to-toe with a fresh-out-of-the-box Galaxy S8+. So, why make the phones QHD at all? VR! At least, that's a convenient scapegoat. Notably, you can change the resolution manually to the full QHD. I'll have a few more words about this in the performance section of the review, so stay tuned. Getting back to the screen, I found it worked well even in direct sunlight, with Samsung's ultra-high contrast overboost mode kicking in to maximize readability even in the most challenging conditions. Sure, that'll drain your battery real fast, but it's better than not being able to see your phone. The Galaxy S8s also have support for HDR video, but I believe it's only the HDR10 standard (not Dolby Vision). As far as I know, this will work with select apps that are specifically optimized for Samsung devices, so I would expect adoption of this in a wide way will be fairly slow for the time being outside the core video services like Netflix and Amazon. Still, it's good to have, because the screens on these phones really do deserve HDR video to fully take advantage of their impressive capabilities - especially those positively inky black levels. I applaud Samsung for continuing to include its helpful screen mode setting, which allows you to choose one of four color profile presets depending on how you want the screen to look. The "basic" mode offers the most unforgivingly accurate reproduction of colors, something I find helpful when reviewing photos. Finally, let's talk about the edge. Last year, I was pretty clear on my feelings about the Galaxy S7 edge having issues properly rejecting fingers or palms at the edge of the display. Because of the way curved-edge displays are shaped and the fact that Samsung curves both the front and the back of the device, it's essentially impossible to hold a curved-edge phone without your fingers or palms touching the edge of the screen. On the S7 edge, this was absolutely maddening at times. It made the phone nearly impossible for me to use if I was lying on my back, for example, doing some email in bed, and it was one of the reasons I stopped using it so quickly after my review period. I am happy to report that it looks like Samsung has given some serious attention to the issue of edge rejection. I tapped out a full email on the S8+ lying back on the couch and didn't get a single misread character or failure to respond to input. I browsed the web, scrolled through Twitter, did some texting, and it all went off without a hitch. That's cause for a sigh of relief - I was really worried Samsung would just continue to act like this issue didn't exist. Battery life and charging I've only been using the Galaxy S8+, so that's the phone I can give you battery life impressions on. My take so far is that battery life is at least as good as the Snapdragon Galaxy S7 edge from last year, a phone that offered above-average performance in this area. In single-day heavy use, the phone could reliably get 5 hours of screen time, sometimes creeping closer to 6 hours. That's very good - exceeding the Pixel XL in performance, even. Will the Exynos variant once again clean Qualcomm's clock on efficiency? I guess we'll have to see how they compare in reviews around the web. Still, the S8+ does really well here, and if you want the version of the phone that's going to be able to power you through the most usage possible, that extra 500mAh of capacity (3500mAh total for the S8+) over the standard S8 isn't anything to sneeze at - and I doubt the larger display cannibalizes all of it. Samsung has also claimed that these batteries should hold up better over the long haul than those in last year's phones, saying that the S8 and S8+ will retain 95% of their effective capacity after a full year of typical usage (the S7 retained just 80%). That's welcome news, because as we all know, battery life doesn't tend to get better as a phone ages. The idle drain on the S8+ wasn't particularly great in my experience, but that's because I had the always-on display enabled. Samsung estimated on the S7 that you'd drain under 1% of your battery per hour with the feature turned on, so I think those of you really looking to get every bit of battery bang for your buck possible will want to turn this off. It does have an effect. I also turned off Samsung's very annoying app "sleep" feature, which looks at apps that are using power in the background but that you don't use regularly and then forces them into an "sleep" state to prevent them from waking the phone. It's well-intentioned, I know, but if I want something like that, I tend to trust Greenify, and honestly, I'm generally OK with letting Android's Doze do its work. Finally, just as a note: all of my testing was done in the standard 1080p mode the phone ships in - I've not turned up the resolution to full QHD. Obviously, if you do this, your battery life will suffer as a result of the increased number of pixels which need to be rendered (apparently not - it's just performance). However, I really can't be sure just how big an effect this will have, and it's not a particularly easy thing to test outside of a highly controlled environment. Charging the S8 and S8+ is just the same as it's been for years with the Galaxy line of phones, using Samsung's Adaptive Fast Charge technology based on Qualcomm Quick Charge 2.0. The one change comes in the port, which is now a USB-C connector. Oh, and Samsung has made the charging bricks and cables black now, instead of white. It charges at the same speed all Samsung phones with Adaptive Fast Charge have over the years, and the charger still has a Type A USB port. Samsung says the retention of the older charging tech and Type A port is to make transitioning from legacy products easier for their customers, and it looks like the S8 will even include a microUSB to type C adapter tip in the box. When you sell as many smartphones to "normals" as Samsung, these are very valid considerations, and so while enthusiasts might be a bit miffed than Qualcomm Quick Charge 4.0 and USB Power Delivery aren't in tow here, it's not like the phones charge slowly. Samsung also still includes wireless charging, and it is releasing a new wireless fast charging pad which provides the same speed as the fast charging pad for the S7 did last year. This year, the pad has a rubbery, leather-texture surface and pops up to act as a phone stand, which is kind of cool. Wireless charging is available on all Galaxy S8 models, too - no worrying about regional variants here. Storage, wireless, and call quality The Galaxy S8 and S8+ come with as much storage as you'd like - as long as it's 64GB. There's only one storage tier being offered in the US (I wouldn't be surprised if China gets a 128GB model), but you can expand that with a microSD card. I really will hand it to Samsung for upping their base offering to 64GB - 32GB just doesn't cut it these days, and 128GB can seem a bit overkill. This T-Mobile variant I tested came with 53GB of that available to the user out of the box, which should be more than enough for most of us. Wireless performance on the phone has been excellent for me. Data speeds on T-Mobile have been great, and the Galaxy S8 and S8+ support a large number of advanced network technologies here in the US to ensure you're getting the most possible out of your carrier's network. Be it advanced LTE carrier aggregation, wireless MIMO, VoLTE, HD Voice, Wi-Fi calling, LTE-U - it's all here. You can thank Qualcomm's X16 LTE modem for most of this. A lot of things can be said of Samsung, but they rarely ever miss out on a chance to be a showcase for the carriers' newest features. T-Mobile, for example, says the S8 and S8+ will be the fastest-ever smartphones on its network thanks to 4x4 MIMO, carrier aggregation, and 256 QAM support. Wi-Fi performance on the S8+ has been great for me, and Bluetooth in my car has been flawless, providing strong reception and zero pairing issues (something that can't be said of certain phones starting with "P"). I've come to expect Samsung to get Bluetooth right over the years, and they still are. Bluetooth 5.0 support is on board courtesy of the Snapdragon 835 chipset, but no real consumer devices out there using the standard exist yet. But you can take advantage of some of the standard's increased power right now - for example, Samsung has introduced a new feature called dual audio that lets you stream to two pairs of Bluetooth headphones at once. That's pretty awesome. Audio and speakers The Snapdragon 835 features a newer revision of Qualcomm's Aqstic audio "codec" (basically, the DAC and headphone amplifier), and I do think some noticeable gains have been made here. For one, I feel output on the headphone jack is better - driving big, high-impedance headphones left me with more room on the volume slider than attempting to play the same tracks with my Pixel XL. I also might be hearing some improved bass response, but that could just be the extra "oomf" the new amplifier is providing. Quality itself is still excellent, and I really noticed no difference on that front between the 821 and 835. Annoyingly, Samsung's volume warning still won't let you exceed a certain threshold until you accept a warning dialogue saying you might blow out your ears. It is very annoying. I realize there are laws on the books about this in Europe, but why does this have to be in the firmware for every variant of the phone, and why does it have to tell you every time you plug in a set of headphones? That's certainly not the case with Apple or Google's phones here, but Samsung seems dogged in its resistance to this regional accommodation. Samsung doesn't seem to have really done much with its external speaker. It sounds decent, but the direction it fires and the peak output leave a fair bit to be desired. In the age of waterproofed smartphones with itty-bitty bezels, it's hard to see speakers being a major priority anymore. It's sad, but it's true. Camera I was a fan of the camera on the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge, though I do still have my critiques as they've aged: colors are exaggerated and processing can be overbearing. Samsung claims that while the camera in the S8 and S8+ is the same one found in last year's phones, they've done work on the processing side to increase image quality. What does that mean, exactly? For my eyeballs, it means less aggressive sharpening. As with last year's phones, the S8 is an incredibly capable camera in low light conditions. The f/1.7 lens hoovers up a surprising amount of light even in challenging conditions, and with a steady hand you can get some pretty crisp shots where other phones would just render an unpleasing mess of noise and blur. Even Google's Pixel is no match for the S7 in low light - the dual-pixel autofocus and aforementioned lens make a formidable duo in the dark. Photos shoot off fast and the camera launches quickly, though I had honestly hoped for some improvement in speed given the new Spectra ISP the Snapdragon 835 features. In fact, the Galaxy S8's camera still doesn't launch as consistently quickly as my Pixel XL's, especially when using the quick launch feature, where the Pixel XL is very noticeably faster on the draw. That's... not great. It's still quick to start up, but you'd think Samsung would be focusing on this kind of stuff in terms of trying to be the best. Previous Next When we get to the actual business of the photos, I think nearly everyone who buys this phone will be incredibly happy with how their snapshots turn out. They're vivid, crisp, and as I said, the results in challenging light are still as impressive today as they were last year. I definitely approve of Samsung's reduction in the amount of sharpening applied to photos - things just look more natural now. The colors are still a bit unrealistic at times, and Samsung's automatic HDR is nowhere near as impressive as Google's HDR+, meaning you'll still get blowouts in particularly high-contrast scenarios. But the camera is good. In terms of the app experience, Samsung has added Snapchat-like overlays and stickers (for joy), but aside from a new option to place a floating shutter button on the UI, the camera app is essentially unchanged from how it appears on the Galaxy S7's current Nougat build with Grace UX. That means you get a Pro mode with a few more shooting options (including RAW output), filters, slow motion, panorama, hyperlapse, and more. All in all, the camera experience on the S8 hasn't really changed much this year, and while I wouldn't call that a letdown, per se, I don't think Samsung had the best smartphone camera last year overall, and leaving it essentially unchanged for 2017 means it probably won't this year, either. Performance The version of the Galaxy S8+ I'm testing uses Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835 chipset, not the Samsung Exynos chip that many other markets around the world will get. If you want to know about the 835's capabilities on paper, we have an extensive post benchmarking its performance. In the real world, the Galaxy S8 and S8+ are the very first smartphones to utilize Qualcomm's new chip. How's that gone? Well, I am happy to report that the Galaxy S8+ I'm testing is very noticeably faster than an S7 edge with a fairly fresh Nougat install. It's a pretty stark difference. Has Samsung conquered the infamous lag its devices develop over longer periods of time? I can't answer that today, obviously, and Samsung really isn't interested in discussing it, either. As more reviewers and eventually consumers spend more time with the phone, we'll be able to better assess that issue. That said, out of the box, the Galaxy S8+ feels almost as quick as my Google Pixel XL. A little faster in some scenarios, too, but I would say the two phones offer reasonably comparable performance based on the week I had to really compare the two. The Pixel XL isn't what I'd call the fastest Android phone for raw speed (I'd say the OnePlus 3T wins there), but it's the consistency of its performance that has really impressed me in the last six months. If Samsung can keep even close to this level of performance on the Galaxy S8 six months from now, that'd be a huge boost for the user experience on its phones. That is, unless you really heat up the S8+. Between benchmark testing runs, I noticed the phone developed the very typical kind of lag I'd found on devices like the Galaxy S7 edge last year. The Pixel doesn't do this. The OnePlus 3T doesn't do this. Why are Samsung phones so aggressively throttling under thermal load? Still, the number of times I worked the phone hard enough in regular use for this to be an issue were negligible - as in, it really didn't happen at all outside the back-to-back benchmarking scenario. One performance asterisk I'd like to point out is that the Galaxy S8 and S8+ do give themselves something of an edge on phones like the G6 and Pixel XL inherently, because they run at 1080p resolution out of the box instead of the 1440p every other QHD phone does, but you really can't tell the difference 95% of the time. On the whole, I'm satisfied with how this phone performs. During the hands-on event, I was much more tepid, as I just didn't have the time to really get a feel, especially comparatively, for the overall smoothness and consistency of the experience. There are, however, some areas where I think Samsung could improve. The way the notification shade draws down feels a bit clunky (not slow, just weird), and sometimes the virtual navigation keys have a split-second delay on interaction. It's also definitely a bit easier to choke up the S8+ with manic opening and closing of apps than the Pixel XL - it does start to get a little overwhelmed when you really, really push it. I also think Google is doing a better job on touch latency, as sometimes the S8+ feels just a bit behind my fingers. As for benchmarks, you probably won't be surprised to learn Samsung's implementation of the Snapdragon 835 isn't as fast as Qualcomm's reference device. I've pasted a results table for popular tests below.

Instead I'm going to devote this section to brief thoughts I've had when using the phone - specific, relatively concise observations about what the Galaxy S8+ is like to use. The fingerprint scanner is too hard to reach on the S8+, misreads are common. You may smudge the camera lens when reaching for the scanner, meaning blurry photos if you're not an obsessive lens wiper like me. I tried to use the iris scanner, but it was even worse than the fingerprint sensor with my glasses, my hit rate was well under 20%. Unlike with the Pixel, Bluetooth performance in my car ('16 Mazda) was great - I didn't even need to take the phone out of my pocket. The S8+ is fairly easy to keep a grip on width-wise, but it is very tall, and pulling down on the notification bar one-handed just feels risky. The top area of my homescreen is basically a no man's land for the same reason. I can't say I actually care the phone renders in 1080p by default, you can't really tell. I didn't end up using the always-on home button feature at all, even though it is kind of neat. If I bought this phone, I'd turn off always-on display to keep the idle battery drain lower. While not the newest or fastest standard, Samsung's 15 watt fast charging still tops up the phone pretty quickly in my experience. On the launcher, the Samsung Pay quick-access peeking thing reduces the size of the touch targets for the nav keys. I switched the navigation key order to the traditional Android layout (back, home, recent apps) and haven't looked back. Samsung's new launcher looks alright but I went straight to Nova, in part to get my round icons back (yes, I have been Pixel indoctrinated). I don't know how anyone lives with the stock Samsung keyboard. Yikes. Even with all this extra vertical space, I still can't find a single compelling reason to split-screen apps on Android. Samsung still isn't allowing "OK Google" hotword recognition when the display is off (probably because Bixby). Software For the purpose of this review, much of my definition of "new" is going to rely on what is new versus a Galaxy S7 running Samsung's GraceUX update on Android 7.0. So with that in mind, let's get to it. What's new Navigation keys The biggest change, of course, is down at the bottom of the screen: virtual navigation keys! I'm not going to get caught up on how they look - I just care that they're there and they work. And you can change them to the proper back-home-recents order, which I did immediately upon setting up the phone. Choice feels good. You can also change the background color for the navbar if you're so inclined. The home button has a few extra tricks up its sleeve, too. It's always on - even if the always-on display mode is off and your screen isn't illuminated, there's a pressure sensitive area where the home button displays. Just press with some force (the amount of force can be adjusted in settings), and your phone will wake up just like you'd pressed a physical home button. You can see why rumors are swirling that Samsung wanted to integrate a fingerprint scanner with this feature - it would make complete sense. The home key will also respond to hard presses even when an app is overlaying the navbar. Honestly, I didn't end up using the hard press feature pretty much ever. You can also set it up to just display the lockscreen on a double-tap of the button. (Which is fine, but seems an inferior solution to tapping anywhere on the display to do a wake as LG, HTC, and other phones do.) Bixby *cracks knuckles.* OK, let's talk about Samsung's intelligent assistant... thing. Bixby exists in three incarnations on the Galaxy S8 at this time. First, there is Bixby Home (Google Now). Then, there is Bixby Reminders (which is, well, reminders). And then we have Bixby Vision (Google Goggles). We'll talk about each of them, I guess. Bixby's banner feature, voice controls, is not available at the time of this review, and will supposedly launch here in the US later this spring. For now, then, all the Bixby button does is launch Bixby Home.    Bixby Home is the most involved of the three, so let's begin there. Bixby Home is a bit like someone took your Google Now feed and made it less useful. It displays recent photos you've taken, advertises themes on Samsung's Galaxy Apps store, suggests wallpapers, gives you unnecessarily large calendar event cards, displays random GIFs from giphy (why), gives you a list of your most frequently visited websites (if you use Samsung's browser), as well as your most frequently used apps. There's also weather, your step count (helpful), and news served from Flipboard (which you can remove entirely). Currently, Bixby home integrates with a few third-party apps, too. Spotify, Twitter, Uber, Giphy, Facebook, CNN, and Foursquare all can pipe in data to the Bixby Home app if they're installed on your device. Of note: Bixby Home by default can run from your lockscreen, though Samsung does disable cards that might contain personally identifying information like your contacts or calendar. Bixby Home does look kind of nice, so there's that, but I just don't see anybody using this. Google Now is helpful for the deep insights it has about your habits and interests based on the fact that Google knows an insanely creepy amount about what you do on the internet. Samsung will probably never be able to get that deep. Then, we've got Bixby Reminders. Bixby Reminders is exactly what it sounds like: you can set a reminder to do something, including based on a time or location. There are roughly, I don't know, a billion apps and services out there that do this much more robustly and with far more powerful features. I don't see any reason to care about Bixby Reminders unless you're a big fan of Bixby Home, which is where you will be able to find said Bixby Reminders. Finally, there's Bixby Vision. You use it by opening the camera app and pressing the Bixby Vision button. Right now, Bixby Vision can identify wine. I tried a bottle, it didn't work. Bixby Vision can also identify text for translation. That's kind of nice. Bixby Vision can identify objects. I showed it a Galaxy S7. It gave me results for iPads. And it can read QR codes, because it's 2017 and we're still using those. So, yes, it really is just Google Goggles but kind of different (and worse?). You can probably safely ignore Bixby for now, but maybe voice commands will make it actually somewhat useful when they do arrive. Try not to hit the button accidentally, though - I'm doing it all the time and it's getting kind of annoying. Snap window Snap windows is an interesting attempt by Samsung to make Android's splitscreen functionality suck less when you're using it to watch video. Let's say you're watching something in YouTube but you also want to keep texting someone without interrupting your video. You could use Android's built-in splitscreening to do this, but every time you pop out the keyboard in the chat app, your video is going to get pushed around and interrupted and reload constantly. It's a bad experience, and kind of shows just what a sorry state multitasking really still is in on the platform.    Snap window is a band-aid, of sorts, on that problem. With your video player open and the video in view (in portrait mode), open the multitasking UI and the card for the video app should have a third icon to the left of the splitscreen button. Hit that, and you're given a crop interface. Move the rectangle over the area where the video is playing, adjust the size if necessary, and hit "done." At this point, the video will "pin" to the top of the screen, and the lower part of the interface becomes the app switcher. Pick an app, and you're off and running - the video won't move at all even if you pop out the keyboard, and plays back smoothly. I have no idea how this really works, but Samsung clearly understood that video was a pain point in the Android splitscreen experience, and this makes it much better. I can't say I'll use it, but given all that vertical screen space on the S8+, I'm sure someone wants to know about this. Snap window works with any app, of course, but video is the most obvious application. Dual audio Thanks to Bluetooth 5.0, the Galaxy S8 can transmit the same audio to two pairs of Bluetooth audio devices at once. This could be great for watching movies or listening to music on a plane together, for example. I tested it, and it works. Samsung does note that because you only get one volume slider to adjust on the phone, the output level to each connected Bluetooth device will probably vary, and you'll need to adjust the device volume for individual control. Still, it's pretty cool. Separate app sound This is another one I found digging around in Samsung's labyrinthine settings menu: a new feature called separate app sound. I know, this sounds boring, but hold on - it may actually solve a problem that's been bugging you for years. Streaming music over Bluetooth is convenient, but it does tend to come with a catch: your device can't play any other media audio when you're streaming music, because that'll pause the player app. So if you want to play a game or watch a video silently on your phone while you're streaming tunes to a Bluetooth speaker or headphones, you can't - there's only one media channel. This fixes that. Once separate app sound is enabled, you can select one app and make it the exclusive media audio provider to a connected Bluetooth device. So, if you want to make sure Play Music is coming through your Bluetooth speaker, pick the Play Music app and select the Bluetooth device, and only that app will be allowed to send media audio to that speaker while this setting is enabled. (Notification audio, unfortunately, is not blocked - that will still come through.) But, now you can open up YouTube, a game, or browse the web on your phone while Play Music is going without worrying about pausing your Bluetooth stream, as all other media audio will play directly through the device speaker instead. This is a pretty decent idea. Other changes I've got some smaller features and changes I discovered, and I'll list them out here. Fingerprint scanner can be set to pull down the notification shade and, from the home screen, to launch Samsung Pay by swiping up. Face unlock mode. Always-on display mode has some very slight aesthetic tweaks. That's really it. The software changes versus the current GraceUX OS on the GS7 and S7 edge are pretty minor. General UI (launcher, notifications, lockscreen, navigation keys) The notification tray is essentially unchanged from the current version of Samsung's skin running on a Galaxy S7, though the launcher is an all-new version of TouchWiz Home that uses a swipe-up (or down, actually) app drawer a la Pixel. Samsung has also implemented some kind of ape on launcher shortcuts, but they're not really launcher shortcuts - they're just a bunch of actions you can take on the icon. For example, you can multi-select icons in the launcher, remove a shortcut, sleep an app, uninstall it, or go to the info screen. It's kind of handy, really, but I'm not sure it could easily coexist with Android's app shortcuts - the list of items would get really long. In lieu of Google Now, the TouchWiz launcher has a pane for Bixby home to the left of the first homescreen. Yay.    Like me, you're probably going to toss off that stock launcher almost immediately, so I won't dive in too deep. It seems like a fine launcher as OEM launchers go, but if you want any kind of customization, you've still got to go third party. The recent apps menu is the same as you'll find on any up to date S7, and the lockscreen has seen a slight visual refresh, though still offers the same shortcuts for the dialer, Samsung Pay, and the camera app. Of note: Samsung takes a more conservative approach with whether or not it will stretch apps into "full-screen" mode on this new, longer display. There's an area in the settings menu where you can force toggle apps to display in the full UI space, as I've noticed many, even some Google apps, are not set to by default. I forced this on for all my apps and haven't had any issues, but your mileage may vary. Software: Opinion I really don't mind GraceUX. Samsung doesn't mess with stock Android too much these days from a strictly functional perspective. I don't like that I have to disable some things like Samsung's app sleeping, touch sounds, or navigation button order - but here's the thing: I can. There are very few things which I cannot change about the software experience on the Galaxy S8 that are genuine annoyances. Don't like the launcher? Throw on a new one. Don't care for Bixby? Ignore it. Almost every potential software negative on this phone is either easily replaced or simply kept out of sight and out of mind.    Throw on your own launcher, set up Samsung Pay, and try to ignore that you'll probably be seeing "7.0" on this screen for a while - that's my advice. Meanwhile, Samsung adds genuinely useful features like Samsung Pay, screen modes, its dual audio Bluetooth feature, game modes, fingerprint scanner gestures, face recognition, a system-level audio EQ, tons of various configuration options, and more all packaged in what is probably the most technologically advanced smartphone on sale right now. That's not small potatoes. The one sticking point for me, though, is the Android version. The Galaxy S8 ships with Android 7.0, already a version and change behind. Samsung seems to have no interest in changing its approach to platform updates, and that's disappointing. I guess we'll see how they handle things with the S8 and S8+, but I don't have my hopes up. Additionally, while performance is decent out of the gate, I really think we should be demanding more. "Almost as good as the Pixel" is not huge praise considering this phone runs a next-generation chipset and renders the OS at a fraction the resolution a Pixel does. These aren't small concerns for the enthusiast set, but I don't think they're at all fatal to the phones. They're just worth considering. Value In essence, the Galaxy S8 and S8+ retail for $750 and $850, respectively, here in the US. That's a chunk of change more than an LG G6, though that phone does only come with 32GB of storage and features an older chipset. I think that considering the advanced display, processor, and level of quality Samsung is delivering, the prices are totally justifiable. Now, that doesn't mean they're not expensive phones - they are. Really, really expensive phones. But the standard S8 to me is more the competitor to the G6 and Pixel XL, while the S8+ sort of stands on its own as a direct challenge to the iPhone 7 Plus. Many people may not find the size of the S8+ very practical - it really is quite tall. Samsung phones also mean a glut of accessory choices for things like cases, full compatibility with any US carrier (including advanced network features), and more attention from 3rd-party developers in terms of ensuring apps run as they should. These aren't trivial things, even if they may not often go into the traditional smartphone value assessment. Is there nearly $300 more hardware in a Galaxy S8 than a OnePlus 3T? Of course not. But that's not really the question anyone is seriously asking. I think Samsung is charging a pretty penny for the S8 and S8+, but I also think they're doing more to convince the average consumer than, say, Google, that the price of admission is actually worth it. Conclusion The Galaxy S8 and S8+ are great smartphones, I have no doubt of this. Are they great smartphones for everyone? That's a question that, as an Android enthusiast myself, I have a harder time sounding decisive answering. I really like the Infinity Display. I like the very good battery life. I don't mind GraceUX - it's fine! I like the cameras, I like the quality of the phone itself, and I like the new software navigation keys. I have a harder time accepting the update situation and the already-slightly-shaky performance. These things give me genuine pause. But if they don't concern you - and they may well not - it's hard to find truly major faults with these phones. Samsung has done an excellent job building upon and refining the formula that it... built upon and refined with the S7 and S7 edge. The S8+ is probably a little big for most people, but I like that Samsung is offering a "real" big phone in its mainstream lineup. And if you don't want a "big" phone, the standard S8 really is very manageable. Samsung has built two excellent smartphones with the S8 and S8+. We're awarding both the S8 and S8+ our editor's choice "Most Wanted" accolade as well. Whether or not that gets you excited really comes down to what you value in a phone. For me? I'm still pretty happy with my Pixel XL. But if I was shopping today, I'd give the S8, or the S8+, a long, hard look. Tags galaxy 8 review galaxy s8 review subscribe ...

David Ruddock Can you tell I was in a bit of time crunch? haha. Thanks again. Pete Smith Its the first GS8 review I came across so got my eyeballs, your effort was worth it! Marty Just for interest since you used Geekbench, my Honor 8 got this score. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4b179b912ffc406ee06b6dff18a2017929f27362c4f2d6b7945c1341904cf980.png Mark Whelan my Mate 9 scored 1859 single core 6474 multi-core I still think the battery life is going to be just average on these new Samsung phones on the Snapdragon chipset...I get a solid 36 hours out of my phone with 8 hrs screen time. S8+ will get 5 hours most likely on a 15 hr day...and badly needing the charger.... What's the point of a QHD screen if you ship it running 1080p? Marty My opinion is that Huawei's going to displace Samsung as the top Android OEM since they are making such good phones. iKon Agreed, Huawei are slowly climbing up, they already in top 3 and it won't take long to get past apple. Anon probably in just a year or 2 to overtake Apple. It will still take quite a while to displace Samsung. 4 years? Marty If Sammy keeps languishing with their mobile division, it won't take 4 years. Samsung's software, while brimming with features, just isn't good. The only software Sammy has put out that's above and beyond anything else in its class is an app: Samsung Internet Beta. Dubs816 lmaoooooo dickchao Yeah these guys are delusional lol Marty By the way, the resolution is selectable. I'm pretty sure the S8 wouldn't be locked to FHD. Steve McQueen Love my Mate 9. Getting 8-9 hours of SOT is pretty nice. And I love not having to worry about battery life even during a 20 hour day. Stu Would you recommend this phone? I'm thinking of grabbing it the next time it's on sale. Marty Absolutely. It's one of the best phones I've ever owned. It's gorgeous, superbly made, feels good in the hand and is probably the fastest phone I've used. The fingerprint scanner is amazingly quick. The phone works so well too. If you don't mind an Android phone more similar to an iPhone, this is it. The system pretty much looks more like an iPhone than any Android. But it doesn't lack features like an iPhone would. My opinion why the Honor 8 hasn't received the fanfare it deserves has to do with religious hatred of Apple and the iPhone by Android enthusiasts. They can be quite irrational. Anything that even hints of iOS is likely to be shunned no matter how good the device is. I got the 64GB blue one and have been smiling since. And get a Spigen case for it if you get one. The Spigen really enhances the beauty of the Honor 8 while protecting it. m477 I like iOS. I really don't like cheap copies of it, and some of the common chinese-OEM software solutions, like a pre-installed, intrusive cleaner. I hate bullshit like that. Marty I wouldn't call EMUI on the Honor 8 a cheap copy of iOS. But it sounds like you have a gripe against the Honor 8. m477 I'm just calling EMUI what it is. It's clearly meant to mimic iOS, and it has some very questionable design choices. I have nothing against Huawei's hardware, I own a P9 lite. Marty Yeah, well I don't see a problem with it. It isn't iOS. It definitely runs quick. Smoothest, fastest Android yet. m477 My problem it's that I find it ugly to look at, compared to other interface, and I really don't like that it tries so hard to mimic iOS. To each their own. Marty Like how Samsung tries so hard to copy the iPhone. But, that's how it goes... Marty You know something? I used to listen to people like you about the Honor 8 before I finally decided to do an impulse buy and get one. Things that people like you say kept me from taking a chance on it. I'm glad I did an impulse buy because it turns out to be one of the best phones I've ever owned. It isn't nearly like what people like you say about it. I've already said that Android enthusiasts raise objection to the Honor 8 for whatever reasons, but the general public will love this device because it is that good. All people have to do is disregard the "Android enthusiast" rhetoric about it and give it a go. D13H4RD2L1V3 EMUI 5 is pretty good. Tried it on a Mate 9 along with its Pro variant and it does zip past screens without effort. Sure, its aesthetics are questionable but it is much improved. m477 Good for you. I'm not an Android enthusiast as much as a tech enthusiast. My daily driver is an iPhone, and I've tried most of the various Android UIs (even ColorOS and MIUI). In my opinion EMUI design wise is one of the most derivative. I don't like the fact that is a copy mostly because it seems to be screaming "I want to be an iPhone but I'm not". It got much better with the fifth version, and it will not get in your way (most of the time, at least). It's obviously still Android under the hood. Most Huawei phones are overall good, but you can't deny that software design is not their forte. A normal user will be fine with that. I personally just don't like copycats. Marty Comparing EMUI to Touchwiz, I'd say Huawei is an expert on software. Meaning EMUI is way better than Samsung's junky software. My Honor 8...the software experience...feels refined and high quality compared to many other Android systems. If anyone wants the truth about it, just give an Honor 8 a try. Update it to EMUI 5/Android 7 and use it daily. It's impressive. This is coming from someone who has a great many phones and has experienced many more. I can list all the phones I've owned and have used and this Honor 8 is the finest of them. m477 The hate on Touchwiz/GraceUX is a little more than a meme right now. Design wise it's not that bad, actually. Every modern, highly specced phone is a good phone (with a few exceptions), and will be "impressive" in daily usage. It's mostly a matter of preference. Marty Heh...so if someone who has a significant number of modern devices sees one of them stand out as impressive, it means nothing? Like you say, "to each, their own". Michaels_28 EMUI = Spyware. I tossed out my Honor 8. It was a good phone for the price I paid ($350 with a promo) but if I had to do it again I would avoid it. Having said that, the reason why Huawei is not selling their affordable phones like hotcakes in the U.S. is not because of irrational hatred. It's because of 1) national security interest, and 2) patents. If you remember the length Apple went after Samsung because of "rectangles with rounded corners," then you should be able to picture the legal barrier Huawei (or anyone really) is facing. Marty If the government was concerned about national security, Obama would never have been president. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I like MIUI. It's very iPhoneish. m477 If you can stand EMUI, which is a cheap copy of the iPhone's interface, and some of the crappy software solutions, it's a good phone. Cakefish Galaxy S7 w/Exynos 8890 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/d012918ef89a330af9de9ee732fbd0c60a69cebc2441f666b62a620328a3c72c.png MJ "...already-slightly-shaky performance." LOL Someday Samsung, someday. I really like look of the phone but the fingerprint scanner location (and shape) is really tragic and a no go. Toss3 Pretty sure that's just the 835 slowing things down, as the exynos version I tried was buttery smooth (smoother than my tweaked exynos S7). There are always going to be some slowdowns, but in the case of the S-series most of it can be linked back to the Snapdragon SoCs. David Ruddock Plenty of OEMs make Snapdragon chips run perfectly smooth. It says far more about Samsung than it does Qualcomm. Toss3 Didn't mean to make it sound like there is anything wrong with Snapdragon SoCs; they just aren't a priority over at Samsung and if you want a smooth experience, you need to get the international version. Samsung is definitely to blame, but they do offer an alternative and it's always better to let people know that the Exynos version is the one to get. MJ The international version is not really an option in the US for most people. Warranty, Samsung Pay (that fixed yet?), and some type of payment plan are all big things. ericshmerick No wifi calling, no gogo pass functionality (on T-Mo). likurges who cares about the US? america is falling apart MJ Yeah, it's just horrible here so don't believe anything you hear and certainly don't waste your time immigrating here. likurges believe me, the us is towards the bottom of my list of countries that I'd want to migrate to. and now that you hurt my feeling I'm going to get them checked for free because you know .. single payer healthcare is a thing in the modern world MJ Dude, why do you keep advertising on the Internet how bad it in the US? I wouldn't want my fellow citizens to figure it out also thus ruining your future increases in elbow room in your own country. Worse, you could end up a out terrorist watchlist and then Donald drone strikes your ass. I wouldn't take the chance man! Single payer? Sweet! That's almost worth exchanging for having any real professional sports. I am BLOCKING you now. All bets in on if the troll responds again! likurges dude freedom of speech, have you ever heard of it? blocking people you don't like makes you similar to The Donald whispy_snippet "if you want a smooth experience, you need to get the international version" ...you need to get a different phone all together. MJ What? No... tu3218 Just use google smart Lock. I rarely need to use my fingerprint scanner on my S7 edge because of this. MJ I rarely use my phone at home and don't have a smartwatch so Smart Lock is of limited use to me. The fingerprint scanner is the best option for me and I am not buying the S8 so it doesn't really matter. tu3218 On body detection...this doesn't just apply to the s8. It's any phone. Just in case you were unaware of that feature. I know I always forget about that one. S8 does the best of everything besides the fingerprint scanner. Very easy to look over. m477 Is not easy to look over. Even budget phones have nailed the fingerprint reader. It's unacceptable that it sucks on a flagship. tu3218 I agree. Last minute terrible decision. It helps knowing that. Doesn't make it right though. TBD how bad it is when I get my s8. Smart Lock helps though. Rick Atherton it might just be me but every phone I've used the on body detection the phone always does stuff in my pocket so i always turn it off Drakenoid I use Gravity Screen instead of that, works far better. Scott It sucks they couldn't figure out how to put in under the display as they clearly wished they could. I just hope Apple has the same issue, or Samsung will have some serious egg on their face come iPhone time. MJ While the under the display fingerprint scanner would be cool tech I am not sure about having a permanent fingerprint smudge on my screen. LOL whispy_snippet A fingerprint sensor under the display makes perfect sense. I can't wait until every phone can do it well. MJ A fingerprint sensor under the display would be cool but NOT any more practical (I would argue LESS practical) than a sensor on the back (and less costly to implement). whispy_snippet Having owned a Pixel since launch I'd have to say I disagree. I love my phone. I think the Pixel is such a well rounded experience. But the one area I really think could be better is the fingerprint sensor placement. Sure, it's great when it's in my hand. But it's almost always on a desk in front of me - just like right now. If I want to quickly check something, I need to pick it up to use the fingerprint sensor or leave it on the table and swipe in my pattern. Sucky. If the fingerprint sensor was on the front this issue would be eliminated immediately. I feel like putting fingerprint sensors on the back is just a way of being different to Apple for different's sake - and I guess I can sorta understand this given Apple kicks up such a huge song and dance the moment anyone tries to do anything coming close to their approach. But fuck it. Just put it on the front and fight them I say. MJ A Pixel XL owner since launch myself. The fingerprint sensor is quick and accurate and my finger slides into place naturally. What is there not to like? I never could understand "the phone on the desk argument". Incoming text and call information shows right up on the lock screen. I can just double tab and put in my pin if really need to do interact but I would pick it up and use the fingerprint scanner just like any other time I use my phone. I mostly use my phone when on the go anyway which means it is in my pocket and a rear sensor works much better (and natural) than the front sensor on my former HTC 10 ever did. "I feel like putting fingerprint sensors on the back is just a way of being different to Apple for different's sake...". Huh? No... Again, I would argue a sensor on back just makes more sense and in the case of Google they have always used on-screen buttons so a single fingerprint reader on the front would just look stupid (aka see Moto) and also the Nexus 6P/5X had front facing speakers so the sensor had to go on the back. whispy_snippet The thing is, double tap to wake doesn't work reliably. It works maybe 75% of the time. Not bad, but when it lets you down it grates. In fact the same goes for Google's screen off voice unlock - it works maybe 60% of the time and this REALLY annoys me... but I digress. The fingerprint scanner on the back is great when it's in your hand but annoying when it's on a desk. A fingerprint scanner on the front is good in your hand and good on a desk. Ultimately, I think I'd prefer a consistently good user experience. I think a fingerprint sensor behind the display will be the end goal for every phone maker. In a couple of years I reckon everyone will be doing it. Bryan Breguet Fingerprint sensor on the back makes no sense to me and is an automatic dealbreaker. I truly hate it. Also, really, you don't understand the argument of when the phone is on your desk? Surely you are trolling. MJ I think people who think they can't use their phone because it's sitting on a desk and it has rear fingerprint scanner are trolling. Alejandro You can double tap the screen to read the notifications...No need to unlock the phone with the fingerprint sensor. Bryan Breguet You can double tap to read the notification, not the full email or even picture or whatever. Are you guys really that thick that you are trying to use this argument? You'll ultimately need to unlock the phone and therefore it means you won't use the fingerprint almost half the time. Scott You mean on your touchscreen? MJ Yes. whispy_snippet On the one hand, yes. I expect Apple will get the fingerprint scanner under the display right for their upcoming flagship. On the other hand if Apple comes out with a minimal bezel, curved edge display it's going to be a special moment for Samsung. Finally, Samsung will be able to say outright "You copied US, Apple" and they'll be right. m477 You hope that a competing product has some issue and the advanced technology that everyone want's will not be ready, so Samsung's sells won't be hindered? Do you own Samsung stocks or something? Scott Hell yeah I want the iPhone to faceplant. Liam Bulkley I know the "2.5D" (are they still calling it that?) is, thus far, largely a gimmick, and effectively reduces the reading width due to distortions, but the front of the s8/+ looks gorgeous. All that glass..... Nope. Bad! Metal would be better, but a nice high quality plastic would be best. Is Samsung in the pocket of Big Glass? enoch861 I've switched my S7 Edge between UHD and HD and I've never really noticed a battery life difference between the two. My battery has been overall atrocious for some reason, but I can't find the perpetrator. Overall I'm not sure if I'll be upgrading even though the S8+ looks quite attractive. illregal Samsung cheap garbage mainstream phones for the followers TechGuy22 LOL illregal funny because it's true. 2kool4skool ...that will sell millions. illregal yeah, there are walmarts all over the place as well. Quantity sold is not a factor of quality. 2kool4skool Then what is the factor of quality in this case? Amount of raging fanboys in tech forums? Flagships cost a lot these days. The fact that tens of millions of people trust their hard earned money with Samsung devices might say something about its quality. illregal It actually says something about their inability to think for themselves. Their inability to know what the difference between devices is in the first place. Most people call android devices droids. or think samsung is the only company that even makes android devices. You're giving people to much credit. They are much more dumb than you assume. Plus they saw 4 commercials for samsung crap during their episode of dancing with the stars, so it has to be good right!?? 2kool4skool And how do you think Samsung able to get all over the place in the first place? Samsung mobile division also start with with a humble beginning like every other android oem company. Htc arguably was a bigger player in early android days. But Samsung has consistently able to give what people want until today, that's why it keeps growing and expanding and now you can see 4 commercial about it during episodes of dancing with the stars. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It's called capitalism. And it works most of the time. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yes quantity is an indicator of quality. McDonald's doesn't make the best quality food, but they sell the most because it's the best and most consistent quality fast food. I say that as someone who would never eat there, too. You don't compare McDonald's to Ruth's Chris, because they're not in the same category. The S8 and S8+ will sell gazillions because they're the best quality flagship phones. illregal You just contradicted yourself. They will sell gazillions because they are all over the place, and people are bombarded with ads, and don't know any better. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Debating with you is a waste of time, but McDonald's is all over the place because people like the food. If nobody liked it, they couldn't open so many locations. Consumers love Samsung phones. Deal. illregal I know what people love.. Problem is I have to support their poor choices. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Well, I don't have to support your idiotic comments. You're blocked now. Suicide_Note Cheap? Nope. Garbage? Nope. Mainstream? Yes, but that's what happens when you sell tens of millions of devices. XDAMM Excuse me while I enjoy my gorgeously designed phone with the best display and top tier cameras, performance and battery life. Samsung's S series are indeed mainstream but they're not cheap and they are definitely not garbage. Their software could always improve and they could release major Android versions faster but their hardware game is just too strong and at least their software is usually stable and reliable (unlike previous Nexus phones and the Pixel which continue to be plagued by Bluetooth issues even months after release). I'd love having a consistent 60fps UI like the Pixel does but I won't sacrifice other software additions and considerably better hardware just for smoothness. illregal sweet pink display yo. sweet top tier, meaning not as good as some cameras yo. Performance, yo.. Enjoy your stutters. and average battery life. Cat Astrophy Enjoy your pocket explosive XDAMM Really? That was funny and relevant when the Note 7 was confirmed of having that issue but not anymore. If you think about it every battery powered device is a potential hazard but we don't usually worry about our Bluetooth headphones or laptops exploding even though that happens often. A few S8 will likely combust because statistically speaking it's nearly impossible to make a perfect phone, but its quite unlikely for that to become a widespread issue again. Jumanji! Be honest - do you work for Saygus? Middlefinger Compared to who? Google? Its phones are total junk, riddled with hardware and software faults, and over priced. TechGuy22 i'm buying S8+ used probably the exynos version so i can put AOSP on it Bewear That would have been considered a crazy idea some years ago. Time sure changes everything! 2kool4skool Always go with exynos version. Smother and more battery life. The only drawback is a bit weaker gpu than SD version, but meh, we're not going to play crysis on it anyway. TechGuy22 yeah i can't be with a locked down phone. Tech Writer The GPU is more powerful on exynos this time around. Toss3 "I would seriously worry about breaking this phone if I bought it. There is so much glass - Samsung phones essentially require cases." - Not sure I agree as the glass is pretty tough if the S7/S7 Edge are anything to go by. Only thing I didn't like about the S8 is the curvature on the front glass, as it is just too much and makes the display look distorted. Middlefinger I agree, plus the glass can be changed, whereas a metal unibody cant (as easily) and dents/ scratches much more easily. Ammar I just cannot decide between this and the Pixel XL. S8 is just a sultry, almost exotic looking device. But despite what the reviews will say, I doubt the performance and battery will be as consistent. jonathan If you want consistent performance and timely updates go for the pixel or wait for the next pixel, if you want a sexy device go with the S8. Me myself I always prefer the device with consitant performance and timely updates XDAMM I care more about a fast and responsive UI, fast app opening and switching and good gaming performance than 60FPS UI. Because of this, the better display, cameras, ingress protection rating, iris scanner, wireless charging and 64GB of (faster) storage by default there is just no comparison and I'll get the S8. The Pixel is an interesting proposition but it's not sold officially in my country and they have so many Bluetooth and battery related issues they're just not worth the asking price and trouble IMO. Rod http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif P. Sherman Bluetooth on Pixels are damn near UNUSABLE since launch. The fingerprint reader was rendered UNUSABLE in 7.1.2. Lags here and there are infinitely more acceptable than hardware failures, which apparently the Pixel is very good at. Rod I don't think inconsistent performance is acceptable on a > 720 bucks device. P. Sherman But it's still better than NON-PERFORMANCE. 2kool4skool The only thing I don't like from this otherwise great devices is the extra "Bixby" button. It kinda mess up the seamlessness of the device a little bit. But I don't think it's would be a significant upgrade from s7 edge, but I really like where Samsung is heading with these new devices, though. I'll wait for the next iteration, if the rumors are true, next galaxy s would probably feature an under-screen fingerprint scanner. It would make the device evn more seamless, they could get rid the home button entirely. One could only hope. Ome Dries Are the screenshots on the S8 square? That means it renders pixels the display can't even show, imagine how much performance & battery life they could've gained 2kool4skool Considering it renders 4262400 pixels by default, I don't think few pixels on the corners would make that much of a difference. create812 Stock Android or bust. Also, what's the deal with Project Fi? Can any phone with the proper radios take advantage of a Project Fi SIM, or does Goog only allow "approved" phones? Marty Only Nexii and the Pixels. create812 I think I saw a video early in the Project Fi days of a Samsung phone having a Fi SIM in it, and it partially worked (only worked with one of the carriers). I'm wondering what the current status of this is. Can someone pop a Fi SIM into their S8 and figure out what happens? Max Apparently we can also include now Nokia phones. raazman Can't wait to see what they're gonna do. OligarchyAmbulance Nokias are supposed to work on Fi? Max Not at the moment, but the rumor mill is that they want to be "the next Nexus" so depending on their relationship with Google that could be the case in the future. Just a guess based on rumors so take it with a grain of salt. FeelThePoveR Or OnePlus. (Or custom roms in my case) Roy No. OnePlus tow don't got any nougat Defenestratus What is stock android these days? I don't even know. EvilHowl AOSP Eric Abreu You can use a Project Fi sim card with other phones, but you'll only have access to the T-Mobile network. I think that you'll also need to activate the sim card on a Nexus or Pixel device before moving it to a non-Google device 2kool4skool "Stock Android or bust." You're missing out so many great phones out there. raazman What's so great about them? Mike Limited bezels is a good start. Realistically, to keep this short it would be more what's so great about stock phones: 1. Fast Updates 2. Quicker UI 3. ........ That's about it. raazman Quicker UI? I beg to differ. Fast updates? Um what? Not even remotely close. Mike You need to read the entire comment to get what I'm saying. Unless you are, in fact, saying that Samsung's phones will get quicker updates than Pixel phones. raazman Oh, oops. I replied to 2kool4skool. I already know Google's Nexus Pixels are better in both regards. Mike And that's also where it ends in terms of what does stock offer over other Android phones. raazman Opinions I guess, because I differ on that stance. Mike Other than the two things I named, name something stock Android does better than a phone Samsung/LG released. FeelThePoveR Customizability which is the main point of android I guess. Middlefinger Whos updates? Googles or Samsungs? Recent events should tell you that rushing to install whatever Google pushes out isnt always a good thing. 2kool4skool They don't have endless problems like pixel and pixel xl for a start. raazman Ummm...you sure buddy? LG? Samsung TouchWiz? Which phones are we talking about here? And my Pixel XL has not had a problem yet. So I'm not convinced. Mike Ah, the good old "My ____ is working fine so obviously there's no issues at all". Hearing this always makes me appreciate what we've become. raazman I just commented saying I've seen this trend since the S3 among friends and family, calm down. Mike "And my Pixel XL has not had a problem yet. So I'm not convinced." Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Nobody who owns a Pixel XL has a problem with it. Except those who do. 2kool4skool I don't know man, I tend to believe tech sites like this more than the trend among your friends and family. And this site talks a lot about pixel problems. The last one was 2 days ago about some pixels losing fingerprint scanner functionality after latest update, look it up. raazman How about note 7 explosions? TouchWiz lag? And now it seems like the S8 screen has color issues. 2kool4skool Here we go again with "my phone might have a lot of problems, but at least it doesn't explode" argument. Note 7 is dead, and people get their money back, so it literally cost people 0$. How much pixel cost? 800$? Stop comparing 0$ phone to 800$ one. raazman Haha you're delusional if you think the galaxies don't have issues. 2kool4skool I never think or said that. All phones have issues including galaxies. But it's the first time I see devices (pixel and pixel xl) with so much problems that continously popped up and being featured on Android sites for almost every two weeks. Roy Because everybody want to hear about Pixel so even it's a little bunch of users let's make a headlight. Rod Actually, many people lost $ due to cases and other accessories not being refunded. Middlefinger Never seem this mythical lag, the Note was bad, but a one off, this screen colour seems like a first batch issue like all devices have. The Pixel is just riddled with faults even the newest batch. Remember the N5 was redesigned because the first run was so poor, the N7 had terrible screen quality problems and slow NAND, HTCs have had multiple camera issues, the iPhone also had screen issues, Sony had battery issues. Its common. Rod How about this one? http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif Middlefinger Right, first release software (or even pre-release). Ive seen just as bad on a Nexus at release, if not worse. My Samsungs have never exhibited anything like that. Rod I've had 3 Nexus, and never saw anything like that either. Middlefinger Ive had 5, all had some lag, I returned 2 because they were poor quality. Roy Not really he was talking also about 6p and shocking it's smooth as ever. Most of the users don't have this problems. Middlefinger Samsung sell hundreds of millions of phones, Google has sold about 12 Pixels.. OK an exaggeration, but the point remains. If you sell more, a LOT LOT more, then problems seem more common, but as a percentage they arent. 2kool4skool And out of 12 pixels sold, 9 have problems. 9/12, needs more bugs. - IGN Rashad Actually, 9/12=.75 7.5 = Good -IGN Roy Not really. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Correction: HTC has shipped about 2 million Pixels and Pixel XLs since launch 6 months ago. Samsung has 20 million S8/S8+ phones ready for launch. Middlefinger and will sell more than 2 million in the first day. Nexus/pixel sales have always been poor, just like the product. Roy My 6p also no problem. illregal Samsungs have more hardware and software issues than everyone else combined. raazman Since the S3, yes this is what I've personally seen among friends and family. 2kool4skool Lol, who are we kidding here? You can find bunch of articles about pixel problems on this site. Last article I read was 2 days ago about some pixels lost ability to set up fingerprint scanner after latest update. Roy Haha but it isn't true my 6p rocking with a great fingerprint scanner. Middlefinger I think the Pixel has that crown now. I have had zero problems with any of my Samsungs, ive returned all my Nexus devices due to faults and poor quality. create812 I know, but stock Android, fast updates, and compatibility with Fi are my top priorities. Roy Not really. Not looking for junk. Defenestratus Picking up my S8+ on Friday - despite Bixby stupidity. I'm praying that the community figures out how to disable it. I currently have a Nexus 6P that constantly infuriates me. The pixel was not a value proposition that I was convinced was worth it - and I doubt the Pixel 2 will be either if they stick with the old, tired form factors and tiny screen sizes. So S8+ is what I'm left with. We'll see if it leads to user angst or not. I'm trying my best to be optimistic. Jay If it can be disabled by a package disabler, I'll be happy. I think. catalysto Early rumors say Pixel 2 will have a much smaller bezel like the other phones coming out this generation. I wouldn't make any assumptions yet. 2kool4skool If Google wanted smaller bezel for their pixel 2, they gonna need to pick some company other than Htc to do their devices. Htc simply can't manufacture a phone with small bezel or water resistant because their manufacturing process is outdated. catalysto Who says Google won't do that? 2kool4skool I never said, that. In fact, I think It would be cool if they go with Motorola this year. illregal their manufacturing process isn't outdated. They just care. They mill out unibody designs from a solid block. Which takes time and effort. Unlike samsung, who just stamps out garbage, quantity quantity quantity. 2kool4skool Have you seen their latest device, htc u? It's enormous in size, but only has 3000mah battery. It's thick af, yet it still has a very protuding camera. It doesn't even have audio jack, water resistance, and wireless charging yet yet it still cost an arm and leg. If that's what you mean by care, I can't imagine how much shittier their device would be if they made if without care. Jay There might be a few more compromises here than I originally thought but it's too late to cancel my pre-order. Now I don't know whether I should even bother. 😕 Thanks for this uncertainty now, David. (Partially kidding..) 4Ui812 I see the red tint in most pics. AC has a story about that problem with some phones in Korea . Is the bootloader locked down like with the S7E ? http://www.androidauthority.com/galaxy-s8-displays-red-discoloration-764692/ https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2550b567c5a3bd243534cc66e251d0edbb770bd373e83a7961b5012e2e49c482.jpg Marty Holy shit! The HTC S8. 2kool4skool Probably just some devices with miscalibrated screen, for now can be solved by lowering red pixel intensity in setting. But they'll probably fix it via OTA later. Samsung introduced new screen calibration setting on nougat, you can set the intensity of each of RGB pixels to meet your desired color balance. Here's setting screenshot on my s7 edge. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/78c23a79995e1f76d6daf742ac05cc0f8893b2871459eeb4cdfec41c6eef2872.png illregal You can't fix poor screen quality with an OTA. If you lower a setting to calibrate a device via an update. The ones without the issue will then be more off. It's not a matter of adjustments, its a matter of poor qc and not yielding consistent products. 2kool4skool How it's "poor screen quality"? It's not hardware problem. Just some minor adjustments via OTA, and it will be fixed. If you're asking how they're gonna fix it without ruining other devices, the answer is the same way Google fixes pixels with Bluetooth problem without ruining the ones that's function just fine. It's software problem, they're gonna figure something out. FeelThePoveR It may as well be a hardware problem, because why couldn't it be? 2kool4skool I highly doubt that, because as I said before the problem can simply be solved by lowering red pixel intensity in setting. Galaxy s screens has always feature calibration setting as a feature, probably it's just some sloppy written code messing up with the setting. And if that's the case, it would be fixable via OTA. Take my answer with a grain of salt, though. Because we still need confirmation from Samsung if that's indeed the case. This is merely the logical answer I can think of for this problem. catalysto Is calibration the problem? Because software cannot calibrate a screen without being able to see it. So no, an OTA would not be able to fix that. The screen must be calibrated at the factory. 2kool4skool Software doesn't necessarily needs to see the screen in this case. Samsung can get their hands on the affected device, tweak it and figure which screen batch affected, and send tweaked software to all devices via OTA. Your comment does make sense, though. Unless Samsung can figure out which devices affected and need for fix, users probably will have to resort to the last option, go to setting and tweak it themselves manually. illregal what I'm saying is.. You can't push out an ota to adjust the screen calibration. Because how is that OTA gonna pick n choose which ones need the adjustment and which ones don't. It's a hardware issue. Samsung makes garbage. 2kool4skool They don't necessarily have to send out an OTA that needs to pick which ones need adjustment and which ones don't. They can just send an OTA that works for both as intended. But whatever, you can believe what you want to. I merely stated what I think a logical answer for this problem. Middlefinger You can if its due to a setting. HTC managed to get rid of a huge red blob in the middle of the HD2 camera with an update. Plenty, like you, assumed it was a hardware fault. Rod It's not. https://i.imgur.com/oYe2HPZ.jpg Rod The problem is, if those devices already have those values maxed out. 2kool4skool Actually, rather than fixed values, these RGB settings act more like percentage values. Meaning you can set them lower and it wouldn't make a difference unless one value is bigger than another. It's hard to describe but I'll include another screenshot. The result would be the same even if you lower those values as long as it's on the same level. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2788b47dbae19707db41c131c25f545abf51fe7ac923621517261397b1c4390b.png same as https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/78c23a79995e1f76d6daf742ac05cc0f8893b2871459eeb4cdfec41c6eef2872.png Rod Yeah, I know. That value was arbitrary. Though now I'd like to know from Ruddock himself what were the default values in his review unit. 2kool4skool Yeah, and apparently some screens might interpret those values differently / inaccurately, hence the problem. And if that's correct, an OTA fix should be logically possible. That's all what I was saying. Rod I hope so. But all OLED panels I've seen to this date, has screen tint of some color. Either red or green. 2kool4skool Can't deny that. Some OLED panels, especially the lower end ones are struggling to produce a balanced color, it's usually most noticeable while viewing white color. That's why IPS screens usually produce better whites than oleds. But oleds produce deeper black than IPS. In the end, each have strength and weaknesses. Get what you prefer. Rod Yeah. I, for one, prefer pure white. Can't stand the reddish whites on the S8 reviewed here. C Lo Who doesn't enjoy buying a $900 device and then having to fix it yourself. Sounds like a swell situation to me. /s 2kool4skool Nobody said that. It sucks that this problem happens. We're just discussing possible fix for it, not trying to disregard the problem itself. Rod Oh boy..... https://i.imgur.com/oYe2HPZ.jpg 2kool4skool You really don't get it, do you? That's why I said it's miscalibrated. Although both of those devices have the same RGB values, the affected device read and interpret those values incorrectly. On affected device, you need to lower the Red value to something like this in order to make the red tint disappear. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/5ae0be301ee03f23d53f275a783d6c59be4e7147070152bed2c42ae2ce2551fe.png These articles might explain it better that I do. If you're interested. http://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-clears-air-red-tinted-galaxy-s8-displays https://www.androidheadlines.com/2017/04/galaxy-s8s-display-reddish-tint-korean-consumers-say.html Rod Then why does the one with RED component at zero, still has red tint all over? Rod Explain this, then. https://i.imgur.com/a1e3dTw.jpg Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Pinkgate. Rod https://www.cnet.com/news/some-samsung-galaxy-s8-phones-ship-with-red-tinted-screens/ https://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/img/wdpXe9TcHb700WdDoryWeeQRgBc=/2017/04/18/20260318-f9bb-43e3-8a46-f198a6b88ccf/capture.png Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ My son just got his S8+ and the white is white as snow. The LG G6 has a very distinct blue tint. Funny how there are no articles about that. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/b8c2b9fbef728965ff12187f4f2d10a00f0a4b70842c6075f1655f26f156ae75.png 4Ui812 Maybe that's part of the manufacturing process , I don't know. But I know not all S8's have the Red tint issue , therefore it's called a defect. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Maybe it is a defect, I don't know. If I got a pink one, I'd return it. I wouldn't accept a software update. I'm also wondering if at least some of the people who think they have pink displays simply have the blue filter turned on. 4Ui812 The blue filter shouldn't be causing that sort of issue. Hell the blue filter on my s7e doesn't make that much of a difference. Badelhas A phone made entirely out of glass? lol. No, thanks. 4Ui812 There are metal parts inside 😁 Badelhas That's why it's not transparent, then! 😊 m477 I can't say I actually care the phone renders in 1080p by default, I'll take the extra battery life. Tests have demonstrated that using lower then native resolutions has no appreciable benefit to the battery. What you gain is a more stable FPS count. dabug91 Exactly, there may be a slight difference if you're constantly playing games, but regardless of whether you're in 1080p or 1440p mode, every single one of those pixels on the screen is still turned on and using the same amount of power other than pure black. makapav You will only recover energy saved on CPU and GPU cycles that would otherwise have been used for rendering those extra pixels. Morten Ulv Wont those just be used at giving you higher FPS? Either way, I guess the point was that the difference is negligible. Abhishek Saral So like if I run a 4K XPS 15 on 1080P resolution. Will I see a battery improvement? Tech Writer Not much at all. On the other hand, if you get the 1080p XPS 15, it will last much longer. Most of the higher power consumption of higher res screens comes from the panel itself. Changing render resolution doesn't change this, unless you do native res 3D rendering or play games. David Ruddock Alright, that may well be. I'll adjust to "performance." D13H4RD2L1V3 Probably the only savings you'd get is from the processor not needing to drive a lot more pixels. It's usually quite minimal at best, imperceptibly so at worst. Rod 1080p vs 1440p when drawing 2D is a non-issue, actually. Liam Bulkley "...one would expect, but that turns out not to be the case on this device" :-D godutch It's less calculations though, gpu is less used and can clock lower m477 The impact of the GPU on the battery is very, very small, unless graphically intensive games are in use. End even then, the difference between 1440p and 1080p is not that big. DanSan I pre-ordered the GS8+. Coming from the Nexus 6, this seemed to be my best option even after playing with both phones extensively the day after they were announced. I'm going to miss my Nexus experience but honestly I'm tired of being a beta tester for Googles software. Past couple of months my N6 has been almost useless at times, freezing doing basic tasks. I don't care about locked bootloaders or rooting anymore, I just want to be able to tweak a few things to my liking and have a phone that just.... works. Max If you're picky then there's a very high chance that you will regret moving to a Samsung phone if you are looking for "a phone that just... works". Samsung software has many annoyances for people accustomed to the Google Android experience. demarcmj This. Every time I try to help a family member with their galaxy device I get really frustrated trying to figure out how the damn thing works. DanSan I assume thats because you're going from stock android to Samsung experience, I can understand the confusion Zsolt V And hundreds of millions of people have no such problems. Interesting. DanSan Totally agree with you but doing simple things now are a pain for me. I just want to unlock it and take a picture or text somebody. easy and simple. catalysto Not sure what the problem is on yours. Mine can open the camera instantly with a power button double-press. DanSan That may be true, time will tell. I have an iPhone 6S as a work device, I end up using that because my Nexus 6 has become so bad. Even after a factory wipe. I will take any kind of change Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ We have two iPhone 6S phones in our family. They both "just work" unless there's an iOS update waiting. After updating, they both "just work" again. I have to wonder if some of the apps update before the OS does, and that's why the problems occur when the update hasn't yet been applied. Just a guess. Suhas I switched to S6 Edge+ eighteen months ago from a N5 after being a loyal Nexus user since the Galaxy Nexus. Surprisingly, it was the best decision ever. Back in the day I used to root, flash custom ROMs and tinker with the phone a lot which I ain't bothered to do so anymore. Also the Nexus kept failing on me in certain areas (Bluetooth, memory leaks, sub-par speakers, camera, battery etc.) and I got fed up. The S6 Edge+ was worth the price and it has been an amazing phone. Can't wait to get my hands on the S8! Switch and you will not regret. DanSan I'm pumped but definitely going to be a learning curve when it comes to samsung settings and what not. But i think we were in the same boat, just tired of tweaking and tinkering to get it to do what i want. Even now I have to make excuses for how bad my phone is, granted its a few years old but I'm over it. Gjorgi Lazarovski well you made the wrong choice going with a Samsung device, since "nothing" works on them. You always get the weirdest bug reports from Samsung users. They have issues with a bunch of apps. 2kool4skool Lol if you're talking about bugs, look no further than pixel and pixel xl. You can find bunch of articles about problems with these devices on this site. You have problems ranging from Bluetooth issue, camera halo / lens flare, dodgy connection, fingerprint issue, etc etc, I lost track. Do your research. Gjorgi Lazarovski I was talking about apps compatibility, but yeah Rod Correct. https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/3xgxg2/why_is_there_so_much_hate_against_samsung/ Rod Welcome aboard. http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif Roy My 6p doing the best job until today and still rocking, very smooth and very consist software. Just love it. Heiro78 i never planned on using the fingerprint sensor so thats not an issue. I would only use this along with the other biometric security features if I could have all of them turned on and required to unlock the device. im wondering if the double press home to open the camera is still functional. im guessing not. EvilHowl Yes, it works Heiro78 Cool thanks, i assume you're talking about the double press on the home for the camera shortcut. EvilHowl Yep Chippah Peckas Fresh360 So. Many. WORDS! I LOVE IT! zooster Gemme an on screen fingerprint scanner, a 18:9 screen (not 18,5:9, too long), shave off upper and bottom bezel by some millimeter more, add stereo speakers, dual camera, quick charge 4 and a battery somewhat larger... Then I'll but it ☺️ plexabyte What is this, the Turing Cadenza? Jaime does anybody know if the galaxy s8 has the At&t logo on the back? can't find any image of it (which is great!), but I don't want to be disappointed when my phone arrives with an ugly logo on it's back. wests It does not. The Rebrand Nation From laggy touchwiz 5 of the galaxy s5 to near perfect smasung experience 8.1 Not bad for 4 years FeelThePoveR Considering that OnePlus rose from nothing to the company they are today in 4 years and the fact that Samsung is supposed to be the top player with highest development budget of all, it's pretty bad. Bob Marley They didn't rise from nothing. They have the funding and resources of Oppo, a major smartphone player, behind their back. FeelThePoveR They had to build their "brand" from nothing and their success is impressive, becouse at least where I live people prefer to buy things from known brands even if it's not the best bang for buck, as they don't trust the newcomers. Middlefinger But Oneplus phones still have boatloads of issues and very dubious quality, both hardware and software. FeelThePoveR Boatloads of issues? I wouldn't say so, every device has it's quirks but OnePlus is really good at listening to the community and fixing them. Dubious quality? 1+3 and 1+3T are the fastest Snapdragon 820 and 821 devices ever for half of the price of other comperable devices so what about that is so dubious? Maybe camera is not a top notch one but it's good anyway, certainly good enough for the price. Middlefinger Build quality, and reliability is the problem. I'm a regional manager for a electronics service/retail company, we get a lot back, they just aren't made very well. FeelThePoveR Well I've seen a couple from the inside and they seemed really neatly designed/put together and besides even phones from the "old players" could cause more trouble then 1+ ones i.e. LG with its loose components on the motherboard causing bootlops, Samsung Note 7 burning battery or my oldy HTC M7 purple camera tint issue. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ From feature-free stock Android to Nougat with split screen. Not bad for 4 years. Middlefinger Really it was done in 1 year. The S5 wasnt good, but the S6 was in a different league. The S7 and S8 have just been refinements really. Rod Near perfect? http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif Nishant i guess this would be a great upgrade from my Galaxy S3!!! :) Cat Astrophy So what you're saying...is that this phone is THE BOMB? Typical Samsung. I like my phones non-explodey. My name is…. biased, as always. You call this phone pricey? Then what is Pixel? DanSan There is a difference between being pricey for the sake of being pricey (read: Pixel) and being pricey because you have the best spec available. lomsha Yep at least this looks and feels like an $850 phone. Gjorgi Lazarovski Why biased tho? They called out the Pixel for it's price too, wtf. Like, everyone did. David Ruddock I don't know, maybe read our review? "Price: There's no way around it, the price points are high. iPhone high. And you're going to be hard-pressed to convince the value-obsessed that there's nearly $800 of smartphone in a Pixel XL." http://www.androidpolice.com/2016/10/18/google-pixel-review-a-very-good-phone-by-google/ My name is…. Pixel is a dud, worst value for money ever. You should have been far more negative for Pixel than you were. Sweet talking it doesn't change things. Just because you mention that the price was high, doent meant that you shouldnt have angrily bashed it (if you were a subjective reviewer) And no, S8 doesn't ask a lot. Its a true flagship with the appropriate price. 1+3 owner here. 2kool4skool Shhh... Pixels have G logo on their back. That alone worth the $200. Seriously though, pixels are often get too many undeserved praises (just my opinion) in tech sites, probably because it's the "nerds and purists" devices, which make up most of tech sites target audience. It even got best phone of the year award if I'm not mistaken despite the fact it doesn't have a lot of features a $800 phones should have anf it's infested with bugs and problems even until this day. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ All Google phones get undeserved praise, especially on Android sites. The reason for that should be self-evident. It's self-preservation. Defenestratus It's just a dang shame that you aren't on the editorial payroll at AP. Just a dang shame I tell ya. Max Big comment fail... Both are pricey and both were called for it. Middlefinger Still hung up on updates i see. Is Googles 7.1.whatever really any better than 7.0 with Samsungs mods? Whats the difference? Whats the advantage? In reality, there isnt any. Samsung doesnt run stock android, and isnt bound by Googles mods, or Googles fixes. It can do its own, and that may mean having a slightly lower number in the settings, but it has no negative effect on the security or experience. Other OEMs are the same LG never used 4.4.3 or 4.4.4 on the G2 or 3, but had al the fixes and updates they needed, because the Google updates were device specific and not necessary. Benjamin Walburn It might not make a difference for bugs and security flaws, but certain APIs need the OS update. The image keyboard and app icon shortcuts are two examples. More importantly, there's just no reason to not use 7.1. It's been 4 months since official launch, and major OEMs get early access. Middlefinger Maybe Samsung arent happy with the quality? 7.1 and its variant have been rather.. buggy, of late. Lollipop was like that, its was the worst, and i know Samsung had a lot of custom code in their version. There is no reason though why Samsung cant implement its own version of APIs, or simply wait to avoid issues. Rod Just stop. Middlefinger Stop what? Do you even read this site, the evidence is right here. Rod Samsung doesn't keep their phones updated because they're too busy making unwanted, duplicate apps. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yeah, Google never makes unwanted duplicate apps. Rod Such as? tim242 You need to get a life, if all you have to do is bitch about duplicate apps. EVERY DAY. Rod My life is fine, thanks. Middlefinger No they make time to release to make sure the software works properly. They have to do that because Googles release often doesn't, just like all the problems seen on 7.1.2 lately. Unwanted apps you say?? Like most of the Google apps.. Rod You make it look better than it is. Samsung phones are the most buggy, according to the developers. Middlefinger Are they now, where is this 'developer' news i seem to have missed? Rod https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/3xgxg2/why_is_there_so_much_hate_against_samsung/ Middlefinger One temporary example that is not longer true. What about all of googles messy code and bugs, that kill phones? Benjamin Walburn Oh, they definitely could, but a duplicate API isn't the same as the original, especially in Android. App developers would have to add additional code for the Samsung API. Even mirroring the API entirely wouldn't work, as apps look at the system API level to decide how to run. Even if Samsung copied it perfectly, apps would still detect it as an older Android version and not use the features. I can't comment on the bugginess of the later release. I haven't had any problems with updates, but that would be a valid concern. Godspoken That hero image is freaking amazing. Is the picture on the screen photoshopped? I almost read AP reviews for the great photographs of phones as much as I do for the actual facts and opinions at this point. David Ruddock It's a real image. The screen is color corrected a bit (thanks to Jeff for that) to match the tone of the pavement. But I took the photo on the S8, zoomed in and lined it up, then took the picture with my RX10, yeah. Rod Of course it was edited, to remove the red tint. Lol Crafted Crows It is an impressive piece of hardware but after 1 day of use my fingers hurt :). I have the S7 and I find that size to be perfect. While the screen gorgeous, it's too tall for 1 hand use and the infamous hamburger menu is killing my fingers. Not comfortable at all. Margaritas Ante Porcos Great review. As always. Beautiful phone but we won't see the beauty because we'll have to hide this fragile cutie inside a case. Also Bixby is total crap. So sad to say this but as many other disappointed Galaxy fans I will skip on S8. Absolutely not worth buying. At least not for that money. Fr0gg0 Better luck next time, Samsung. Dallas King Fingerprint scanner on the power button, on the side would have been better. Eumelanin Knight Samsung sees to have an innovative then perfect cycle with their phone. I look forward to seeing what's up with the S9. Yup, I went there. That full screen fingerprint sensor, maybe? Rod There's a really noticeable red tint on that display tim242 Where is that in the review? Oh, it is not there.

The story you linked says only SOME UNITS AND CAN BE MANUALLY FIXED. Rod Well, let's ask @rdr0b11:disqus then BTW: never saw anyone take pictures in broad daylight whilst illuminating the subject with a red light. Maybe the sun shines differently where he lives. Roy You are right, the red tint is clearly noticeable from the pictures and it's bothering me a lot that no one (not even the reviewer) is talking about it. Rod As a LCD-phone owner, I'm deeply disturbed by screen tint. I like my whites milk-like. mlj11 I know Bixby's gonna be unpopular (around the enthusiast crowd at least) but I wish I had something like Bixby Vision. After Goggles' apparent abandonment by Google, I still haven't found a simple and good enough replacement for it. Using Assistant on my Pixel XL just plain doesn't work for stuff like item recognition or QR code reading. Rod Cannot unsee the lag. http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Flipboard has always been very laggy. It doesn't surprise me that its replacement is also laggy. Personally, it doesn't matter to me. I never use Flipboard anymore, I don't use Google Now, and I would be very unlikely to use Bixby. ericshmerick The defense has begun lol Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ No defense. Bixby's info thing is laggy. If that matters to you, don't buy the phone. Rod You can deal with low framerate...

He's not even touching the phone, except when he touches a grayed out option that doesn't do anything. That makes me think your Bixby lag gif is fake, too. Rod If you watched the video, you'll see that he mentions the software has problems, exactly when that part is displayed. whispy_snippet "Fake". Classic. m477 Yeah, Michael Fisher is payed by Samsung competitors to make the S8 look laggy, obviously. Iamsecond Your comment was brilliantly sarcastic, but 'payed?' Seriously? I'm sorry for picking on you, but this is the third time I've seen this misspelling this week and I'm starting to wonder if I'm going slightly mad! Surely 'paid' is a common enough word that everyone should know how to spell it? m477 Welp, I must have been drunk or something. I usually write in mostly correct English, I swear. Miles Reiter To add on to what others have already said, that's not a grayed out option, there's no scenario in Instagram where the search button will be grayed out and non-functional. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ So he just didn't touch it. It's very obvious he's not touching anything on the phone in that GIF. You could also take a screen shot of that Instagram page, and fake it that way. I'll believe these problems when I see them widely reported, not because some bozo posts a gif. JC Just go watch the video. Railwayman Rule no 1 for the Humanity: Galaxy S model X is the BEST DEVICE IN THE WORLD (must be stated in caps so no one miss this basic FACT!) Every kind of criticism of a Galaxy S device are FAKE. Galaxy S is simply the BEST and everyone who are disagreeing are just ignorant and try to escape the reality. Galaxy S is also the FASTEST device in the world, no one comes even close - every video showing any kind of slow down below 120 fps and instant response are FAKE. It is the FASTEST device and this fact take precedence over everything else. Don't question the ALMIGHTY GALAXY! It can lead to the Samsung Underground, which is a world where everyone has a Galaxy with Knox 0x1 Warranty Void and are expected to use Health and Gear VR daily, otherwise they will be punished! Winston Thats a strange issue. I loaded the S8 home screen + Hello Bixby onto my S7. No lag. Rod It's called inconsistent performance. Which means it won't happen all the time. PoisonApple31 Which is why it is not a big deal Rod For someone shelling out 800 bucks for a phone, I think it's not ok. iPhones will be butter-smooth for the same price. Liam Bulkley Mostly. iPhones stutter as well. They do still have the best touch latency, though. Peter World Citizen Looks fake ... Rod What does? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It is fake. Brad Andrews Having used the S8+ for the last 24hrs and being the furthest thing from a Samsung fanboy as possible I.e the last galaxy I owned was the S3 and I truly thought my next phone would be the pixel 2 - All I can say is, Google have gotta step up massively with the pixel 2 if they want to compete. This phone is super smooth (even the stupid bixby app) and an absolute pleasure to use, I really never thought I'd say that about a Samsung phone. Say what you will about Samsung phones of the past, but have a week with 1 of these and I'd say all but the most hardcore pixel purests would be converted, or at least concede it's a great phone. Rod Everyone said the same about the Note 7, until... https://www.xda-developers.com/with-the-note-7-samsung-still-delivers-embarrassing-real-world-performance/ Brad Andrews Hey, I'm just calling it as I see it. If this thing slows down and starts lagging I'm more than happy to sell it and grab the pixel 2 when it comes out. As it stands right now, my opinion is that it's a great phone with no lag. I'm sure if we wanted to, we could find an instance of a pixel lagging in what is basically a 3rd party app (bixby) as well. So this one gif all you Samsung haters are frothing over isn't what I'd call conclusive evidence, it's certainly not what I've experienced. Kevin Davis Great review, thanks. Beautiful phones, but they're going to be a pass for me. Vivek Rameses You can install the new launcher by updating the TouchWiz apk on apkmirror. Had it for a few weeks and it runs fine. Rocket Bixby Vision can identify objects. I showed it a Galaxy S7. It gave me results for iPads. Sounds like Apple will be picking up this idea for Siri pretty soon Marty LMAO...Even machines know Sammy copies Cakefish Interestingly, from the reviews that I have been reading, the Exynos 8890 beats the Snapdragon 835 in single-core Geekbench performance and loses narrowly in multi-core performance. So, overall, very similar levels of performance. Shows that Samsung was ahead of the curve last year, meaning that the Galaxy S7 should age well CPU-wise. Marty I think I can easily pass on the S8. I prefer a device not have a pink tinted display. The last time this happened was with the HTC 10. Too much competition, Samsung, for you to put out lackluster products. jasonlowr Well, Firstly, you dont have the money. Secondly, everyone knows you're a samsung hater. Come on, whenever you comment on any samsung articles,its all about hates from you. Last but not least, youre not a very good actor/lier. Lol. Peace! Marty Lol...Keep your day job. You're funny, but the other kind of funny. 😁 4Ui812 David Ruddock 2 questions. Do you know if the bootloader is locked like on the S7E from T-MOBILE ? Why is this 8 hour old article pushed to the top of the list ? I think I know the answer to the second question. But do you have any info on the first ? Rod Because it's relevant? 4Ui812 Paid. Rod Yes, they get paid better when more people click on pages with ads. roverstim ewww, pink tint. D13H4RD2L1V3 I can definitely see the fingerprint sensor placement being an afterthought. Had Synaptics and Samsung got that display sensor working in time, the feature where you can wake the device from sleep by "pressing" the portion of the display that houses the home button would have a lot more worth. Oh well, hope it's ready in time for the Note 8, but with rumors that even Apple is having issues with it, we may have to wait for 2018. I don't find Bixby all that useful, and certainly not to the point where it needs its own button. It has its merits, but overall, I feel that it's one of those features where people use once or twice after unboxing and then forget that it existed, like Siri, or those who are deeply-vested in the Google ecosystem would probably just use Google Now. I find that rather sad, because some of its other add-ons, such as the ability to play other forms of audio through the device itself while it's casting another audio source via Bluetooth is one of those things that are immensely useful. I just wish that they're actually more prominently shown so that people know it exists. It's a nice phone overall, though. Makes me optimistic for the next Galaxy Note. tim242 THE CAMERA IS NOT THE SAME AS THE S7. 260 VS 333 Rod Who do those numbers represent? tim242 The S7 has the Sony 260. The S8 has the Sony 333. Michaels_28 I've heard that it is the same hardware, different firmware. (and different software) tim242 It is a new sensor.. This has been confirmed. The S7 has the IMX260, the S8 has the IMX333 dblock I am a huge fan of rooting and ROMing my phones, but the truth is, being a crack flasher and flashing new ROMs all the time is really time consuming. So while it will take a while to get used to not being able to do this, and losing Viper4Android (hoping I can make Samsung's EQ work somewhat close to V4A) and some other customizations/tweaks, overall I think I will be more satisfied not worrying about trying to flash the "best" ROM all the damn time. I do hold out hope that basic root is achieved on the phone so I can get V4A going on this thing, but I won't hold out too long. 2kool4skool If you're so worried about sound, galaxies have Adapt Sound feature that you might want to try out. I'm also a former user of viper4android, but decided to ditch it last year because adapt sound is easier to set up. It also sounds fantastic on my hd 449. dblock I can't remember if Adapt Sound works with Bluetooth headphones or not, do you know if it does? That's why I loved V4A, could really fine tune all different output types; phone speakers, headset, Bluetooth and dock. 2kool4skool Well, that's a bummer. No, as far as I know it doesn't work with Bluetooth headphones. ROB You need to add something... DO NOT BUY the unlocked version Chips N Care to explain? ROB Google the S7 unlocked fiasco...they are still on 6.0.1...all other S7 have been updated to 7.0 and they have abandoned the ones bought directly from Samsung... Cakefish Galaxy S7 Geekbench scores. The Exynos 8890 processor was ahead of its time, it'll remain very competitive throughout 2017. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/ccc4e4d7770fbc4f43c68d526b56060883fe49a88537a5e39d175e8207d6c05e.png Rod If even the Snapdragon 800 holds well to this day.. blairh Fingerprint placement is complete garbage. Still no stereo speakers. S8 is too tall. More impressed with the S8 Plus. TeeJay1100 Size is personal preference. I'll say this, after playing with them in Best buy, the S8 feels just right. The S8+ is a tad taller. blairh The S8 is too tall IMO. tim242 The S8+ is even taller... blairh I just think the S8 is way too tall when compared to the iPhone 7. Apple will be releasing a 5.8" screen phone this fall with roughly the same footprint of the iPhone 7. That to me makes a lot more sense then going so tall as the S8 for the same size screen. tim242 You have no idea what dimensions the next iphones will be. blairh You're right. But I also believe the strong rumors of a 5.8" screen with a footprint the size of the current iPhone 7. tim242 There were those same strong rumors about the S8. The current iphone 7 would not fit a 16:9 5.8" display... blairh I believe this is what we will see this fall. http://www.iclarified.com/60037/diagram-allegedly-reveals-design-of-58inch-iphone-with-4mm-bezels-images tim242 Yeah, no. Apple has had gigantic bezels for 10 years. They aren't going to be suddenly nothing. blairh You're dead wrong. Gruber was saying in spring of 2016 that his sources have told him how they want an iPhone that is all screen. I expect minimal to no bezel on the next iPhone. Ming Chi Kuo is also backing up this story with his reports. tim242 There will most likely be smaller bezel, but most likely not what you are describing...especially if they are unable to get the fingerprint scanner under the display. Rod Isn't the S8 even taller? Lol blairh I'm assuming you mean the S8 Plus. Yes, it is, but it also has a larger screen. I just think the S8 is way too tall when compared to the iPhone 7. Apple will be releasing a 5.8" screen phone this fall with roughly the same footprint of the iPhone 7. That to me makes a lot more sense then going so tall as the S8 for the same size screen. Rod But the S8+ is proportionally taller than the S8 lol. blairh I understand that. But I can swallow that size phone when the screen is that large. I think the next iPhone will give you the same size screen in a smaller package. Michaels_28 iPhone 7's body cannot house a 5.8" screen even with zero bezel. blairh It absolutely can. Corner to corner diagonally it's 6". Semianonymous Kinda reminds me of the s6 in a lot of ways. Sacrifices made to acheive a new design. At least they didn't kill the waterproofing and SD slot this time around. lomsha I'm quite tempted. Paul Quinn We knew about the poor fingerprint sensor placement for quite some time. I thought that's probably something that could prove to be less of an issue over time (muscle memory). But now it's sounding like it doesn't even work well. That is enough to kill it for me. I am spoiled by instantaneous unlock on the Mate 9. I don't understand how a brand new phone from THE premier Android manufacturer isn't at least getting close to that. Rod Rushed changed. It was supposed to be underneath the screen. Zahir_SMASH I just want to know what round icon pack that is. Cakefish Pretty sure it's the same one as I use: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.themezilla.pixelui Rod Looks neat for a free app. Zahir_SMASH Thanks! Roy Am I the only one noticing the red-tinted screen issue with the photos of the reviewed device? tim242 Some units have that, mostly the units sent out early. It can be adjusted in settings. Roy Not necessarily. Xda reported that in some units the red-tinted display is not being fixed even after adjusting the rgb and samung is replaging those units. Also, why this reviewed unit was not adjusted before taking the pictures? Just look at them and tell me, the issue is pretty noticeable. Rod Don't worry, there are lots of people in denial here. Rod Oh boy... https://i.imgur.com/oYe2HPZ.jpg Rod Nope. ×XWreckTeamX× Which pics are you talking about I cant notice it that much. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It seems pretty obvious to me in all the photos of the phone where there's white on the display. The white looks pinkish. The screen shots look pure white, though. morrisp Are you in Studio City, David? Ahmad Alnusif Is this review applicable also to the Exynos version of S8+? I see mention of SnapDragon 835 specific features so will they be there in the international version? Fred Question is, where did you get that burger ? Anton Kuznetsov ADOPTABLE STORAGE Does it have it? Rod Seeing as they blocked it in the S7, I wouldn't hold my breath. Nathan J This is the first Android phone since last April when I chose the iPhone 6s over the LG G5 (which, given the bootloop reports, was probably a good choice) that has made me seriously consider switching back. One thought keeps repeating itself to me: the 2015 iPhone 6s will most likely get updates for one year after the 2017 Galaxy S8 stops getting them, given the companies' five and two year update ranges. I can see entry level phones only getting a year or two of updates, but a $750 or $850 phone? This is a hard truth that Android fanboys are going to have to accept, and really start demanding changes to. It's one thing that Apple absolutely does better, and I think it's something that would not be very hard to change. Let's demand five years of updates. Apple can do it and they're more profitable than anyone. Stop. Don't make excuses about why Apple's phones aren't that good or their updates aren't as significant. Don't excuse bad behavior. Have the courage to demand better. If all the phone manufacturers adopted all the best practices of their competitors, and shed their biggest problems, imagine how much more awesome phones would be. That said, we really don't know how long Samsung will update the S8. Maybe they give it three years. Who knows. They've done almost everything right here, and I commend them for that. I wouldn't have minded if they kept the physical home/fingerprint button, if they did it like on the iPhone 7. Not a real button but a part of the screen that vibrates in such a way that feels like a button. Go to a Best Buy and check it out. It's very cool. The fingerprint scanner as-is on the S8... I have seen no one praise this. I'm sure Samsung knows, and it was just too late for them to change it. If everything is the same next year (but updated of course), but the fingerprint reader is mid-center of the back, the S9 will be damn near perfect. As for Bixby — in my opinion, the less said about it, Siri, and Google Assistant, the better. I'll just Google it. Or Bing it if I know I'll be running into ad-infested sites (like Wikia) as the Google app tunnels around my ad blocker (iOS). Either way, I'll take a search app over an assistant app any day of the week. I've tried Siri, Google, and Cortana and have found all of them lacking. So no thanks to Bixby. Disappointing about buttongate, but not a dealbreaker, either. Rod In most cases, the updates are ceased due to the SoC vendor (read: Qualcomm) not providing new blobs after 24 months. That's why there's a rumor Google is designing its own chip, like Apple and Samsung do, so they don't get blocked by Qualcomm. Nathan J I had a Motorola Photon. We heard all the excuses. At the end of the day, it's still a flagship that got zero updates, so it doesn't really matter whose fault it is or why. I mean, it's interesting on a trivial level to find out why, but you're no less screwed at the end of the day. That said, if Google could get control over the hardware in their phones, they'd be better off. Maybe. Can they make more money selling phones that are supported for five years? That's a cycle and a half they're pissing away. Apple can take that. Rod I really hope Google pulls an Apple someday. 5 years of support sounds great to me. Talos the Robot You are reviewing a defected phone with a red tint display and you are awarding it with editor's choice "Most Wanted" accolade, hahaha LOL.... francoism Still sure it'll suffer from the much staggered OTA updates. roverstim Seriously, no mention of the pink screen in the review ? Other OEM's would be picked up on this Rod This bothered me too, seeing as how evident it is. tim242 http://m.androidcentral.com/samsung-clears-air-red-tinted-galaxy-s8-displays Rod I'd like to see a pic of this review unit after calibrating. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Must be manufactured by commie pinkos. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Seriously, no mention of the blue screen on the LG G6?

Ash First official android with kernel version 4.4? dirtyjudo Cash me when it's time for security update. How bout dat? Daniel Tiberius System level EQ sounds neato. I'll have to play with that. Also I read that the Bluetooth to two separate devices feature comes with Bluetooth 5, or the processor and not from Samsung. Anyone know? Peter World Citizen It's best to read some reviews from Apple's love child: The Verge ... When the oppositions praise their main competitor's device then it must be really good. 1. http://www.theverge.com/2017/4/18/15328968/samsung-galaxy-s8-review-s8-plus 2. http://www.theverge.com/2017/4/19/15354444/samsung-galaxy-s8-big-screen-ergonomics 3. http://www.theverge.com/2017/4/18/15338052/samsung-galaxy-s8-touchwiz-android-software Anunnaki "At $750 and $850 for the S8 and S8+, respectively, there's no denying Samsung is asking a lot for the privilege of joining the Galaxy S club this year." It's at-least priced better than the Pixel. Jay I was interested in finishing the review until I saw that you tested it in 1080p mode only. I understand that the phone came with the setup initially, but that setting is what many people will want to use. Rod What's the difference, tbh? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I bet if I walked up to 100 S8 users and asked them if they changed the screen resolution to WQHD, 99 of them would look at me like I had broccoli growing out of my ears. Roberto Should have mentioned a killer feature that for once has been flawlessly implemented by big S development team, Dex. Rod Like all other reviewers, they'll probably do a DeX review when they get one. Lord Ravenor Good review. I'm not certain I agree with David on the size and placement of the fingerprint scanner, though: 1. I went to the shop yesterday and they had a display unit of the S8+ -- it is actually about as tall as an iPhone 7 Plus but a bit narrower (I held them side-by-side). The S8 seems to be about the same size as an iPhone 7, which I find too dainty. Now, I don't have big hands but I'm so used to my iPhone 7 Plus (I've had the bigger iPhone since the 6 Plus) that it's jarring for me to use something that's smaller like the S8 is. As an aside -- based on all the leaks, it looks like the S8 gives us a preview of what the iPhone 8 will be like in-hand. 2. The placement of the home button seems to be just fine. You can definitely train your hand, without too much effort, to place it where it needs to go so you unlock it as you pull it out of your pocket -- I don't expect it to be too much of an adjustment. I'd say that it's about the same as what I experienced with my Nexus 6P in the beginning, even though the 6P's button is recessed. That said, I can't speak for accuracy since it was a display unit and I obviously couldn't save try the scanner with it. The S8+ didn't have any perceptible lag but again, the unit I played with was a display unit that had what was probably a demo ROM SKU (I don't know why I forgot to check that). The unit felt good in hand, overall -- but weirdly, I liked the footprint of the Note 7 more because the S8+ feels like it's too narrow for its height. Then again, I'm used to the dimensions of the iPhone 7 Plus. If there isn't one already, I'm sure there'll be a 'stock' Nougat them in the Galaxy store. There were ones for the Note 5 so I don't see why there wouldn't be for the S8+ Stefan van Manen Its a great phone. Got it for almost a week now and I really like it so far. My major issue with this phone is the lack of stereo front facing speakers. Im coming from a Nexus 6p and I really miss that front facing speaker sound when playing games or watching youtube videos. Other minor things like the fingerprint location, useless bixby button and purple glare at the edge part of the screen don't bother me that much. Oh and first things I did was to replace the sammy launcher (the swipe up animation is soo laggy it hurts my eyes), switch up the navigation keys and install a pixel icon theme which made the switch from my Nexus 6p a lot easier. Railwayman I think it is fascinating with this Samsung fixation around the world. EVERY device from them with the magic Galaxy S name is... A WINNER! Same story every year.;) Every time this brand "wins" my dislike of them just grows bigger due to such things as carrier distribution/lock-in/branding, Knox 0x1 Warranty Void, Grace UX/TW, heavy modifications, developer unfriendliness, duplicated services (every Google service MUST have a duplicated Samsung ditto), mainstream design and so on. Even more annoying is the theory about the need for other devices to 'replicate Samsung' - i.e. that just because that brand do something with their design, EVERYONE is 'supposed' to follow to such an extent that it is perfectly 'logical' to bash products using arguments such as 'bigger bezels than the Galaxy S x' etc. Another issue I have with Samsung is their region SIM lock. i.e. that a 'local' SIM card must be used before the product is 'unlocked'. Samsung make technically good hardware but it is seriously crippled by their policies and vendor lock-in. I think it is fascinating that every test give them a passing grade despite those actions - even worse is when 'counter-articles' are written just because a Sammie is questioned like last year with the XDA Note 7 performance tests. "Samsung Central' felt it an obligation to immediately post an article about how useless benchmarks are.... What a 'coincidence'. I am very much unable to see how the Galaxy S8 can be the 'best device' in the market from a holistic perspective. There are way too many problematic policies, carrier BS and nonsense such as 'Knox is tripped, forget your Health and Gear VR' and so on involved and yes, those things just can't be compensated by the hardware. A very fast brick is... still a brick. A seriously locked in device with carrier BS (not to mention the value proposition it means) just can't be the 'best device in the world'. Galaxy S8 is first rate internals and display with third rate policies where the major ideology is 'My Way or the Highway! (The Samsung Way or Knox 0x1 Warranty Void and your fancy Gear VR in the trash!' Sorry to be critical but I am a bit tired of how a device can be praised year after year after year without any kind of holistic viewpoint where policies are important considerations. Teppka Have my Galaxy S8 plus on pre-order and ordered Thin Fit from Spigen a week ago as they ship internationally. Idea was to receive Spigen case by the time S8 plus arrives. They had two shipping options, DHL with 2 days delivery indication and USPS with no delivery estimation. So I paid $13 for shipping by USPS. After one week tracking stuck and keeps showing the package is in LA, Canada (Canada?!) . So I contacted Spigen for update and reply was that shipping will take 4-7 weeks. You've got it right, 4-7 WEEKS, which is about 2 MONTHS?! And they never even cared to specify this delivery estimation in the website. So the solution they offered me is to wait for a MONTH and if by the end of May its not delivered I should contact them and they will see what they can do. $13 for international shipping with 4-7 weeks delivery? Aliexpress sales cases for $3 including delivery and those delivered within a month internationally and you are informed about estimated delivery time BEFORE you choose shipping method. Spigen charges $13 for delivery and after you pay and item is sent you become to know that delivery is 4-7 WEEKS. I asked Spigen what am I supposed to wrap my Galaxy S8 plus into untill the case may or may arrive in 2 months but they do not really care and keep saying wait till the end of May. I was buying Spigen cases for over 5 years for my phones and am now amazed by their perfect customer service. Any suggestions what I should do? blairh Reviewers are not being harsh enough about the absolute garbage fingerprint location. That is a deal breaker for many. Then the S9 will fix this and reviewers will rejoice. tim242 You are dumb as dirt. Every single review trashes the fingerprint scanner placement. Rod He either edited the comment, or you're the dumb one here. tim242 Nope, it still says that reviewers haven't been harsh enough. That is a lie. Rod Maybe in his eyes they weren't as harsh as he expected? blairh Being critical has levels. Reviewers are not being harsh enough regarding this you prick. tim242 Yes they are. Now, you are a blocked prick. blairh You are such a loser. Michaels_28 I enjoyed Mr. Ruddocks' excellent review as always. He is one of the few whose opinion I can trust on the Internet. ASYOUTHIA✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I am genuinely surprised that the S8 battery has lasted this long. Coming up on 8 hours SoT with screen brightness between ¼ & ½.

How NASA's A.I. moonshots idea could help your enterprise Apple collaborates with rivals to advance A.I. research Video Mingis on Tech: Google rolls out the hardware As Google I/O, the search giant's major developer conference, gets ready to kick off on Wednesday, enterprises will be curious to see if Google offers new artificial intelligence technology they can put to work. Google executives are expected to talk about A.I. and machine learning during the Wednesday morning keynote, led by CEO Sundar Pichai. During last year's Google I/O conference, Pichai said the company was moving from a mobile-first to an A.I.-first world, and the company is expected to dive further into that strategy. "[Enterprises] should expect to hear more about how A.I. will impact their technology development path at Google I/O this year, as the company is one of the providers leading development and deployment of A.I. technologies," said Brian Blau, an analyst with market research firm Gartner. "A.I. will help transform aspects of enterprise operations and make them smarter with capabilities that mimic human traits." Blau also said IT managers and business executives should expect to learn more about how Google is using A.I. with customer apps like Google Assistant, or with developer tools that perform tasks such as decoding photos and video into their core meaning. Google is also expected to announce more details about Android O, the next version of its mobile operating system, and about its Chrome OS. It may also have more news about its services for the cloud and the internet of things for the enterprise, although most of the buzz seems to be about A.I. A.I. services and products could speed up, or event automate, decision making for large companies. The technology could be used in the transportation sector, to operate autonomous delivery trucks or drones, or in medicine, to help doctors diagnose patients' illnesses more quickly and accurately. Jon Phillips Google Home is a WiFi-connected speaker that's powered by Google Assistant, and answers questions, controls other smart home gadgets, and streams music and Internet radio—among other talents. At the 2016 I/O conference, Google detailed its artificial intelligence strategy, which included taking the wraps off several products; its A.I.-based Google Assistant, the Google Home device, Google's competing device with the Amazon Echo; and the Allo chat app. "Since A.I. is already gaining momentum in the marketplace, I expect Google to blow way past what we know already from other companies who are in the space," said Jeff Kagan, an independent industry analyst. "There is enormous pressure on Google to make some serious announcements for the enterprise. I expect to see Google announce a variety of things on both sides -- consumer and enterprise -- and this will just be the start of another revolution for Google." Patrick Moorhead, an analyst with Moor Insights & Strategy, also is curious about what Google will announce that would interest enterprises. "I'd expect Google to follow Microsoft with customizable A.I. APIs for use in applications," Moorhead said. "I think we should expect Google to explain how it separates consumer A.I. data from enterprise A.I. data. Crossing the streams could be a privacy and security issue."  The conference runs Wednesday through Friday at the Shoreline Amphitheatre in Mountain View, California.

 Google DeepMind received 1.6 million NHS patient records through a legally inappropriate deal Sam Shead May 15, 2017, 4:47 PM 1,357 facebook linkedin twitter email print National Data Guardian (NDG) Dame Fiona Caldicott.YouTube/National Data Guardian DeepMind and the Royal Free London NHS Trust signed their first deal in 2015 It gave DeepMind access to 1.6 million patient records across three London hospitals The majority of patients had no idea a Google-owned company had access to their data The deal is being investigated by data regulators The financial terms of the deal have never been disclosed. Google DeepMind received personally identifying medical records of over a million NHS patients on a legally inappropriate basis. That's according to a letter from National Data Guardian (NDG) Dame Fiona Caldicott to NHS Royal Free Trust medical director Stephen Powis on February 20 that was leaked to Sky News and published on Monday. DeepMind, a London-based artificial intelligence (AI) research lab acquired by Google in 2014 for £400 million, was quietly given access to 1.6 million NHS patient records in 2015 to help it develop a mobile app called Streams on the legal basis that it was offering "direct care." Legally speaking, patients are "implied" to have consented to their medical records being shared if it was shared for the purpose of "direct care." But Caldicott, the UK's health data regulator, wrote in her letter: "When I wrote to you in December, I said that I did not believe that when the patient data was shared with Google DeepMind, implied consent for direct care was an appropriate legal basis." Caldicott, who does not dispute the app's ability to help clinicians save lives today, added: "Given that Streams was going through testing and therefore could not be relied upon for patient care, any role the application may have played in supporting the provision of direct care would have been limited and secondary to the purpose of the data transfer. "My considered opinion therefore remains that it would not have been within this reasonable expectation of patients that their records would have been shared for this purpose." The letter, which DeepMind expected to be published last Friday, was sent by email to people including DeepMind cofounder Mustafa Suleyman and DeepMind strategy lead, Will Cavendish. A spokesperson for the National Data Guardian confirmed to Business Insider that the letter is real. Privacy campaign group medConfidential said in a statement: "Google's lawyers are expensive, but 'inappropriate legal basis' is still a euphemism for unlawful." The Streams app.Google DeepMind The National Data Guardian, which was set up to help ensure that citizens' confidential medical information is safeguarded securely and used properly, explained at the end of the letter that she would be passing on her views to the Information Commissioner, Elizabeth Denham, who is the data protection officer of the UK. The Information Commissioner's Office is carrying out its own investigation into whether the data transfer between from Royal Free to DeepMind was legal under the Data Protection Act. A verdict is expected to be made public in the coming weeks. Full copies of National Data Guardian's letter sent to @SkyNews warning of legal basis re: @DeepMindAI + 1.6 million NHS patients' data. pic.twitter.com/QjLRDGs1xr — Alexander J. Martin (@lexanderjmartin) May 15, 2017 Streams is a clinical app designed to help clinicians identify and treat patients as quickly as possible. It pulls together patient information and generates an automatic alert when a problem is detected. It does not make use of DeepMind's AI or machine learning technologies. DeepMind cofounder Mustafa Suleyman.Google DeepMind Following the initial testing period, the Royal Free rolled out the Streams app to a number of clinicians in its hospitals as part of a subsequent deal, which is not being investigated. Dominic King, the clinical lead at Google DeepMind, told Sky News: "It's really important to say that DeepMind is a British company, and although acquired by Google, operates independently. At no point has any patient data been shared with other Google products or services, or used for commercial purposes. "I think one thing that we do recognise that we could have done better is make sure that the public are really informed about how their data is used." A spokesperson for DeepMind Health sent Business Insider the following statement: "Nurses and doctors have told us that Streams is already speeding up urgent care at the Royal Free and saving hours every day. The data used to provide the app has always been strictly controlled by the Royal Free and has never been used for commercial purposes or combined with Google products, services or ads — and never will be. "Clinicians at the Royal Free put patient safety first by testing Streams with the full set of data before using it to treat patients. Safety testing is essential across the NHS, and no hospital would turn a new service live without testing it first. We're glad the NDG has said that further guidance would be useful to organisations which are undertaking work to test new technologies. "We also recognise that there needs to be much more public engagement and discussion about new technology in the NHS. We want to become one of the most transparent companies working in NHS IT, appointing a panel of Independent Reviewers, embarking on a major patient involvement strategy, and starting a groundbreaking project called Verifiable Data Audit. We believe that these steps are helping to set a new standard of transparency across the health system." Google DeepMind's first deal with Royal Free London was torn apart in an academic paper published in March. The "Google DeepMind and healthcare in an age of algorithms" paper — coauthored by Cambridge University's Julia Powles and The Economist's Hal Hodson — questioned why DeepMind was given permission to process millions of NHS patient records so easily and without patient approval. It concluded that the deal was riddled with "inexcusable" mistakes. A spokesperson for the Royal Free London sent the following statement to Business Insider: "The Streams app was built in close collaboration with clinicians to help prevent unnecessary deaths by alerting them to patients in need in a matter of seconds. It is now in use at the Royal Free, and is helping clinicians provide better, faster care to our patients. Nurses report that it is saving them hours each day. "We took a safety-first approach in testing Streams using real data. This was to check that the app was presenting patient information accurately and safely before being deployed in a live patient setting. Real patient data is routinely used in the NHS to check new systems are working properly before turning them fully live. No responsible hospital would ever deploy a system that hadn't been thoroughly tested. The NHS remained in full control of all patient data throughout. "This project, designed to help prevent unnecessary deaths using new technology, is one of the first of its kind in the NHS and there are always lessons we can learn from pioneering work. We take seriously the conclusions of the NDG, and are pleased that they have asked the Department of Health to look closely at the regulatory framework and guidance provided to organisations taking forward this type of innovation, which is essential to the future of the NHS. "We are proud of the work we have done with DeepMind and will continue to be bold and brave for the benefit of our patients." A spokesperson for the National Data Guardian for Health and Care (NDG) told Business Insider: "Dame Fiona Caldicott, and her panel of advisors have been considering how patient data was shared by the Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust with DeepMind under the ‘Streams’ project to improve the detection and management of acute kidney failure. In discussions with the ICO about this, the NDG agreed to provide advice on the use of implied consent for direct care as a legal basis for the sharing of data by the Royal Free with DeepMind. While the ICO investigation is ongoing the NDG will provide any further assistance to the ICO as required, but will not be commenting further on the matter at this point."

With the 2017 edition of Google I/O kicking off this Wednesday (May 17), expect a lot of those projects to be back for an encore appearance, as Google looks to move forward with its assorted initiatives. Daydream VR debuts at Google I/O last year. (Credit: Philip Michaels/Tom's Guide)As always at a developers conference, the focus at Google I/O this week will be on the under-the-hood tools developers need for Android, Google Assistant and the many other pies in which Google has its fingers. That likely means very little hardware will come out of this week's show. Google may have taken the wraps off Google Home at the 2016 I/O keynote, for example, but the voice-powered speaker didn't arrive until five months later. So don't expect a big reveal for the Pixel 2 smartphone this week is what we're getting at. But what can you expect? Google's Sundar Pichai will take the stage at the Shoreline Amphitheatre at 1 p.m. ET on Wednesday — you can watch a live stream here — and here's what he and other Google executives are likely to reveal. More Android O Features This one's about as big a no-brainer as you can get. Obviously, with thousands of developers converging upon its Mountain View, Calif., headquarters for three days, Google is going to have something to say about the next version of its Android operating system. We already have some idea of what to expect with Android O, thanks to a developers-only preview edition rolled out in March. Among the highlights in that release were improvements to battery life by limiting what apps can do in the background, categorized notifications and platform support for autofill features. MORE: 40 Best Free Android Apps Google's likely to introduce a second preview version of Android O at some point during I/O, which will introduce even more features that the company will be happy to talk about during its keynote. Credit: GoogleOne possible topic of conversation could be Google's Project Treble. As reported by The Verge, the goal of Treble is to speed up the rate at which Android updates arrive on your phone. Google is looking to separate the Android OS framework from device-specific software that chipmakers write, which would let phone makers push out updates faster. Google could announce an official name for Android O at I/O, but it seems more likely to follow the course it took last year when it asked developers and users to offer up suggested names, as if Android O isn't going to be called Oreo. Google Assistant Hits the Road Google Assistant already lives on your phone and, if you've got a Google Home handy, in an Amazon Echo-like speaker. The next frontier for Google's voice-powered assistant looks like it's going to be your car. Bloomberg reports that Google will show off Audi Q8 and Volvo V90 SUVs that are running Android as the OS for their infotainment and navigation systems. Google Assistant will ride shotgun on these Android-powered cars, allowing you to use your voice to look up directions and initiate phone calls, among other features.  Google showed off some Android-powered concept cars at I/O last year, but the partnership with Audi and Volvo shows just how serious Google is about Android's automotive future. Other Google Assistant Advances With Microsoft unveiling a Cortana-powered speaker last week and Amazon still enjoying a major edge with all the things its Alexa-powered Echo speakers can do, don't expect Google to content itself just by getting its Assistant into cars. Several sessions at I/O focus on the Assistant's capabilities, with a high-profile talk in the main amphitheatre looking at how developers can "plug into the Google Assistant services ecosystem." That sounds an awful lot like Google looking for more ways to expand its Assistant's feature set. One of the new devices that Assistant could wind up on is the iPhone. Android Police reports that an iOS version of Google Assistant will launch soon in the U.S. This week's I/O keynote would certainly draw a lot of attention to that launch. Google's Assistant push could translate into new capabilities for the Google Home speaker. Earlier this year, the Wall Street Journal reported that Google was looking to add telephone features to its speaker — something Amazon just added with the video-calling capabilities on the Echo Show. Google is also rumored to be considering the addition of mesh Wi-Fi features to the Home speaker. These sorts of hardware announcements aren't typically made at a developer-focused event like I/O, but given the tech world's focus on voice assistants these days, you wouldn't be surprised if Google talked up its own plans. Daydream updates Last year's I/O saw the introduction of Google's Daydream virtual reality platform. Since then, Google's rolled out a VR headset that few phones beyond its own Pixel devices really support. (Google's own website lists the Mate 9, Axon 7 and Moto Z as Daydream-ready.) We're likely to get an update on Google's VR plans, which could include new features, added support from new phone makers or new hardware altogether. On that front, the Wall Street Journal reported in February that Google was working on a standalone headset that wouldn't rely on a phone or computer to drive the VR action. Microsoft has a similar effort underway, and we're starting to see some of the first mixed reality headsets it's creating with the help of hardware partners. If Google's serious about its own standalone headset, I/O would be a good venue for letting developers know what's coming. Chrome We've known since last year's I/O that Chromebooks would be able to run Android apps. And in January, Google said that every single Chromebook going forward would be able to access the Google Play Store. The feature remains in beta though, and we haven't heard much from Google when to expect a ready-for-prime-time release. With an I/O session entitled "Android Apps for Chromebooks and Large Screen Devices," we're expecting Google to provide more detail. Instant Apps Speaking of app-related news from last year's I/O, the 2016 conference teased the idea of Instant Apps in which you can try out apps without having to download them. The feature is now available in a very limited way, but multiple I/O sessions this year on Instant Apps suggest that this will be the feature's coming-out party.

However, if your Android device is rooted, you can no longer access Netflix. You’ll need to take extra steps to watch your favorite movies in this app on the go. According to Android Police’s report, Netflix confirmed that it has made its app unavailable on rooted Android phones. “With our latest 5.0 release, we now fully rely on the Widevine DRM provided by Google; therefore, many devices that are not Google-certified or have been altered will no longer work with our latest app and those users will no longer see the Netflix app in the Play Store.” Widevine Digital Rights Management It’s utilized to offer protection to providers who supply content on Android devices. This latest update is designed to fight against piracy. It’s particularly useful considering that the app has started to offer local downloads on mobile devices. With rooting, you can perform a lot of tasks. These would include customizing the core functions of the said operating system. If you have a rooted device, you can easily rip shows that you have downloaded on your phone. No More Netflix On Rooted Device? It’s still possible to access Netflix on your rooted device. You just need to obtain the Netflix installation file from a third-party. Once you’ve obtained it, install it manually on your device. Doing so will allow you to receive regular updates without having to go through the Google Play Store. Power users own the majority of rooted devices. In 2015, a study found that only seven percent of federal employees are using a rooted device while they’re at work. Despite the small number, this latest update shows that many users still want to use their phones without restrictions. These companies want to make sure that their contents are well-protected. Users who use rooted phones have to deal with the downsides of security updates. What about other apps? Hulu and other competing apps haven’t announced yet whether or not they’re making similar moves. If you still want to use your rooted device and watch movies on Netflix, you simply don’t update your app. But when you do so, you’ll lose all improvements made by Netflix. Then again, it’s an acceptable trade-off if you’re just a casual Netflix enthusiast. Rooted devices aren’t just used for piracy. Everyone with a rooted device knows it. However, Google doesn’t care about how you want to customize your device. It wants to protect its property. With the use of Widevine DRM platform, it creates limitations on the type of hardware and software that a person can use on its device. This decision of Netflix isn’t surprising. But it’s natural for you to get frustrated, especially if you’re a paying subscriber of Netflix as you can no longer access it on your device in the future. It’s unfair, you may think. However, Google and Netflix only want to protect their properties. Right now, the Netflix on your rooted device will still work without problems. But, at some point, it’ll stop working.

Google will announce Assistant for iOS soon, in the US only at launch David Ruddock Follow View All Posts 2017/05/15 7:28am PDTMay 15, 2017 101 Plus 1 on G+ 217 Share on Facebook 140 Share on Twitter Total Shares458 Applications Exclusives News Rumors According to a trusted source, Google plans to announce that the Google Assistant will be launching on iOS soon as a standalone app. The announcement could come as soon as Google's I/O conference this week, but it's unclear exactly what Google's plans are at this time. The app would likely feature a blend of the "chat" style functionality in the Google Allo version of Assistant and the voice-controlled version found on Android, but again, details are scant. We do know that the Assistant for iOS will only be available in the US at launch, and that Google plans to make the announcement in fairly short order. I/O would be a pretty ideal venue for such a launch, as Assistant's SDK was just made available to developers late last month. Bringing the Assistant to the world's second-largest mobile OS would likely encourage more developers to integrate with the app's functionality. As we learn more about this story, we'll bring it to you. For now, just know that Assistant on iOS is imminent. While we are labeling this story a "rumor" because we don't know what Google's exact timeframe for announcing this news is, we're highly confident that the information we were provided is accurate.

Martin You are wrong. Beta is on Android. We test it, then they release it better working on iOS... We keep testing... :-)) Bewear Sad, but true. JD Correction. Google services is always beta. When something is about to Go Gold they shut it down and offer 3 competing products. Because Fuck you that's why. - Google. Filipe Santos You won! King_Android Naw, iOS users would have the first Alpha version of GA while we wait for the rollout to hit our Android devices. Maxwell “Max” Weinbach I have had it for months. S7 Edge and Nexus 6P ADofCLE He's referring to the typical release of Google services. He was being sarcastic. rohiggidy google now/voice search is on IOS. We all expected this MaximumFish "In the US only at launch". Isn't that *still* the case for the Android version? No-one I know if the UK has got it yet, except Pixel users obviously. I've given up checking for it now. Winston Indonesian here. ALL of my devices have it. Since 2 months ago or so. krazyfrog Got it from the day they announced. You probably just need to clear your Google Play services cache or change device language to English US. Alex Yes, I believe that changing the device language to "English US" works, but that's pretty much stating that it's still US only, as you have to pretend to be from US. Shahin Just adding it as a second option works, provided you setup Assistant with US only first. That way you don't have to deal with US Englizh. MaximumFish Thinking about it, I get the sneaky suspicion that I don't have it due to having a Google Apps account. I wish they'd offer a route to migrate from Apps to a standard account. Hyperionite Indonesian here. Using English US as my default language. My device have it. Running Android 6 at the moment Latheryin Won't mean much as Apple will still leverage the use of its own over Google. Heck most android users don't use it what makes them think iPhone users will. Martin Because Google are dumb ducks... I use it, but would use it a lot more, if they make it again to Wake up the assistant from the lock screen on any device... Miss so much from my iPhone being able to say "Hey Siri" and set alarm/timer/call even without touching my phone... And not everyone wants to use Pixel phones... :) David Slawotsky Use Trusted Voice in Settings. That will allow you. Martin I guess this is only for Pixel phones. I don't have this in my settings :) Alex Trusted Voice is part of Google's Smart Lock -- it's not just for Pixel. On my stock Galaxy S7, it's under Settings > Lock screen and security > Secure lock settings > Smart Lock Latheryin To be honest I have it on my nexus and never use. It just not something I need. Let alone want to broadcast what I am doing to every one around me. It is almost as bad as people talking on speaker phone in public. Martin It's personal thing. Some will use it, some wont.. :-)) Latheryin I, see a lot less people wanting to use it on IOS. Won't be enough integration when compared. To siri. To be honest they should just keep the AI on the platform they were made for. We all saw how Apple music did on Android. AbbyZFresh Your point. Apple has Siri and Spotlight embedded in their phone and yet the Google search app is one of the most downloaded in the App Store. Latheryin Those numbers seldom mean real downloads and use. Things like download counts and reviews are seldom accurate with places selling downloads and reviews for really cheap Leandro Brandão I wish I could replace Siri with google assistant. Julie Ankrom I don't want either one. I just want "OK google" and doing a search directly, or giving orders directly. I played with Google Assistant for a while and it just adds a middleman. Leandro Brandão I never used assistant, I thought it was a better ok google. Google app always understands me and give me correct answers. JD If anything it's a worse Google Now. but it speaks more naturally? So I guess that's a good thing? I don't even fucking know anymore. OligarchyAmbulance Assistant is activated with "Ok, Google" and does what you are asking for. In what way is it worse or a "middle man" to Google Now (which it replaced)? destinyhud right when i am trying to replace my ipad with Chromebook detachable. i have hopes for Chromebook C2 at IO SupahNin10doh Thank bliming bob! I hate Siri sooo much. SupahNin10doh Now if they'd also bring it to MacOS Ghostx7x And then to Windows 10 Leonardo Baez Soooo I'm on Nexus 6P and have no assistant yet, but iphone is getting it? Outrageous Cat Astrophy http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/03/02/google-assistant-coming-android-6-0-devices/ If your phone doesn't have it blame your cell provider, not Google. Filipe Santos You have if you choose the supported languages, otherwise no. I changed but if you have your second language, your native language messages will be spoken so damn bad you can't understand or speak sh*t RickJ How does Google expect anyone to want switch from​ iPhone to their phone when they​ keep giving everything away to Apple for free? Keep some things to yourself, Google! Some exclusive incentives for them to switch. Adam Margeson Google doesn't care about switching people to Android. They only care about getting customer data. They can sort-of do that if they keep getting their apps over to iOS. And then provide subtle hints that "Android integrates all of this to make things easier... if you care to switch over." (Not to say that they do integrate things better... just look at the Assistant-on-different-devices fiasco) lauski I'd agree they don't care AS MUCH, but they do care to some degree... Look, they officially have entered the hardware business with the pixels. Right now you're right-- whatever sales they might marginalize are far outweighed by marketing dollars and customer info. The opposite is true for Apple, which is why we won't be enjoying an official iMessage and Facetime release on the Play Store any time soon... Zach Mauch I might at the "[Exclusive]" to this just so i is obvious that it is info from AP. Artem Russakovskii "I might at the "[Exclusive]" to this just so i is obvious that it is info from AP."

They always release their products on iOS. Even though it really doesn't do anything Google Now already does. Cakefish I haven't even got it on my non-Pixel UK Android phone yet. DragoCubed Surprised yet not surprised they did this. I just wished they'd keep some more android exclusives. Nicholas C YES! I am 95% google here but have an iPhone after the whole Note7 shitstorm JD Too bad you still can't use a default assistant other than Siri. I would totally use Google Now if I could. Fucking Hate Siri that useless hunk of code. Filipe Santos Google stop being an a$$hole, why the hell you release an iOS app if you don't even release on the rest of the languages first or countries? Do you only care about profit? Damn ****** ..... jawsnnn Off topic... It was reported months ago that GA was rolling out to Nexus devices. Is that still happening? Does anyone know? Dave Cremin Lol and I haven't even got it in my 6P. Ridiculous. Brad Wilson I put the Google app on my home screen, because it's so much better than Siri. It's worth the extra step to press the button. I hope that Google assistant becomes better than what I'm using now. Premsuraj Can someone explain to me why the Voice Actions on Google Now can work with a lot of languages including hotword support, but Google Assistant only works with US & UK English? Shouldn't the voice detection be a separate component that can work with any voice assistant? Or atleast they should be able to easily reuse the current implementation Teja I got Assistant on my Oneplus 3 few weeks back, I resetted my device few days back and its gone. Its been 5 days and I'm still waiting to see it. Can anyone help? mike shwilly Ok Google, what is this song?

Computing Phones Cars Gaming Science Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Mobile Netflix No Longer Available to Rooted, Unlocked Android Devices Netflix No Longer Available to Rooted, Unlocked Android Devices By Joel Hruska on May 15, 2017 at 4:10 pm Comment Update:  The “unlocked” devices Netflix is refusing to support may refer to bootloader-unlocked devices rather than carrier-unlocked devices. Carrier unlocking refers to the practice of allowing a device purchased from one company to run on another company’s network, while bootloader unlocking allows a smartphone to run a completely different version of Android (or in some cases, an entirely different operating system).  Not all phone manufacturers lock their bootloader and some manufacturers that do lock their bootloaders don’t lock every single SKU they manufacture. It is unclear if the new Netflix app distinguishes between devices that were unlocked by the end user and devices that were purchased with an unlocked bootloader from their manufacturers. Thanks to reader Jeff Bowles for catching this possibility. Original  Story Below: For years, Android owners who wanted a greater range of freedom when using their devices have had the option to root them. The term refers to “root access,” which gives the end user control over options that the phone’s manufacturer had previously prevented them from accessing. Rooting can be used to update a device to a different or new OS, remove applications the OEM installed by default, or install special applications that require administrative access and cannot run on a non-rooted device. The vast majority of Android users never bother with rooting their hardware. But it’s a useful way for power users to keep a device updated after the OEM has abandoned it, or to simply add features and capabilities that weren’t previously available. The majority of applications in the Google Play Store run on rooted or unrooted devices without any problems. Netflix, however, has decided to buck this trend with the latest version of its own app. The company has confirmed that devices that are not “Google-certified or have been altered” are no longer capable of accessing the mobile service. Disturbingly, this appears to apply to devices that are rooted or unlocked. A Netflix spokesperson told Android Police the following: With our latest 5.0 release, we now fully rely on the Widevine DRM provided by Google; therefore, many devices that are not Google-certified or have been altered will no longer work with our latest app and those users will no longer see the Netflix app in the Play Store. Now, in theory, this has been done to make certain that Google’s Wildvine DRM technology isn’t bypassed by a rooted device. But Android Police reports that it’s also blocking devices that have simply been unlocked. There’s a significant difference between the two states. An unlocked device has simply been modified to allow it to be used with multiple carriers, as opposed to rooting, which gives the user much more control over the phone and could theoretically be used to facilitate piracy. Most phone manufacturers sell unlocked devices on the open market (without any kind of subsidy or discount arrangement) and OEMs often will unlock a device on request, provided it’s fully paid off. But the Netflix application itself hasn’t been prevented from running. It’s the download and store listing that are blocked. Android Police notes that whether you can download the Netflix app seems linked to a device’s SafetyNet status, not whether it supports Google’s Wildvine DRM. SafetyNet is an API that checks whether the bootloader on a device is locked; AndroidPay is disabled on devices with unlocked bootloaders regardless of whether those devices are rooted or not. SafetyNet and Wildvine are two distinct technologies, which makes the whole issue rather strange. Netflix is claiming it implemented this change due to Wildvine, but it’s not checking Wildvine status to determine whether to allow installation of Netflix. To get around this problem, if you install Netflix via a website like APKMirror, it still works normally on an unlocked, rooted device — at least for now.

Search Watch Live Home Vote 2017 UK Brexit Trump World Business Tech Entertainment Offbeat Weather Sponsored By Google received 1.6 million NHS patients' data on an 'inappropriate legal basis' A Sky News investigation into the sharing of patients' records raises fresh concerns over the way the NHS handles data. 20:10, UK, Monday 15 May 2017 Image: Google's artificial intelligence arm, DeepMind, has been expanding into healthcare apps Twitter Facebook Google+ Whats App Mail By Alexander J Martin, Technology Reporter - Exclusive Google's artificial intelligence arm received the personally identifying medical records of 1.6 million patients on an "inappropriate legal basis", according to the most senior data protection adviser to the NHS. Sky News has obtained a letter sent to Professor Stephen Powis, the medical director of the Royal Free Hospital in London, which provided the patients' records to Google DeepMind. It reveals that the UK's most respected authority on the protection of NHS patients' data believes the legal basis for the transfer of information from Royal Free to DeepMind was "inappropriate". The development raises fresh concerns about how the NHS handles patients' data after last week's cyberattack on hospitals and GP surgeries, which could have been prevented if staff had followed guidance issued a month earlier. While there are strict legal protections ensuring the confidentiality of patients' records, under common law patients are "implied" to have consented to their information being shared if it was shared for the purpose of "direct care". However, this basis was not valid in the arrangement between Royal Free and DeepMind in the view of Dame Fiona Caldicott, the National Data Guardian at the Department of Health, who has contributed to an investigation into the deal. Image: The first page of the National Data Guardian's letter Image: The second page of the National Data Guardian's letter As Dame Fiona writes, she had informed Royal Free and DeepMind in December that she "did not believe that when the patient data was shared with Google DeepMind, implied consent for direct care was an appropriate legal basis". DeepMind, originally a British business that was acquired by Google in 2014, received the data of 1.6 million NHS patients to test a smartphone app called Streams. Streams is a healthcare app which can detect if patients are suffering from acute kidney injuries and then rapidly inform clinicians so that they may receive potentially life-saving treatment. Prof Powis had stressed that "a quarter of deaths from (acute kidney injuries) are preventable if clinicians are able to intervene earlier and more effectively". Dame Fiona did not dispute the value of the app for patients, but in the letter to Prof Powis she explained that in her "considered opinion" the "purpose for the transfer of 1.6 million identifiable patient records to Google DeepMind was for the testing of the Streams application, and not for the provision of direct care to patients". "My considered opinion therefore remains that it would not have been within the reasonable expectation of patients that their records would have been shared for this purpose," she wrote. Video: Royal Free 'committed' to protecting patient data Prof Powis told Sky News: "We have been very grateful to Dame Fiona for her support (and) advice during this process and we would absolutely welcome further guidance on this issue." Dame Fiona's contribution is currently being taken into account by the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), the UK's data watchdog, which is investigating whether the transfer was legal under the Data Protection Act. The ICO told Sky News that its investigation "is close to conclusion". "We continue to work with the National Data Guardian and have been in regular contact with the Royal Free and DeepMind who have provided information about the development of the Streams app," the data watchdog said. "This has been subject to detailed review as part of our investigation. It's the responsibility of businesses and organisations to comply with data protection law." Royal Free Hospital said it would "consider" the ICO's findings when they are released. Both the Royal Free Hospital and Google DeepMind were first informed of Dame Fiona's opinion in December. The testing for the Streams app has now concluded and it is being used at the Royal Free Hospital, Prof Powis told Sky News, under a second agreement which is not being investigated. He said: "I think everybody's agreed that we need to test, and when that involves patient data - and if it includes using large quantities of patient data - yes, I think we absolutely need to look at that again, collectively, everybody in the system, and we need to understand the guidance around that." Video: DeepMind: Patient data not shared with Google Speaking to Sky News in the wake of the NHS cyberattack, the clinical lead at Google DeepMind, Dr Dominic King, said patient data was safe with the firm. He said: "It's really important to say that DeepMind is a British company, and although acquired by Google, operates independently. At no point has any patient data been shared with other Google products or services, or used for commercial purposes. "I think one thing that we do recognise that we could have done better is make sure that the public are really informed about how their data is used." Dr Julia Powles, a researcher at Cornell Tech in New York and an expert in technology law, said there were "fundamental errors" at the beginning of the data sharing project and warned that these errors could put other data sharing deals in "real peril". The Department of Health is responsible for issuing guidance to the NHS on how patient data can be used in the testing of new technologies, but it has not said when this will be provided. The department did not respond to Sky News' requests for a response.

 I was so excited, and so disappointed, by Google Home Ben Gilbert May 15, 2017, 4:14 PM 11,556 facebook linkedin twitter email print Remember when Google announced Google Home? Yeah, you probably don't — it was back in May 2016 at the company's annual developer event, Google I/O. Almost exactly one year ago. Google vice president of product management Mario Queiroz introduced Google Home during the Google I/O 2016 keynote in May.Google I remember it distinctly, both because I was covering the event and because I was so excited by the product. An Amazon Echo-esque speaker/mic combination, powered by Google? That's literally exactly what I wanted. My only hesitation with buying the Echo — other than the whole "voluntarily buying an internet-connected listening device for my home" — was the lack of deep Google integration. Google is my internet backbone. I use Google Contacts to move my contacts from phone to phone, I use Google Messenger for text messaging, Google Voice for work, Google Keep for notes. We use Google Calendar here at Business Insider for meetings, and I use it in my personal life as well — the same goes for Google Docs. I chat with colleagues from other publications throughout the day using Google Hangouts (sorry, boss!) So when Google Home was announced, I was ready for it.  Ben Gilbert/Business Insider The product re-emerged five months later alongside Google's new Pixel phone, packed with Google Assistant and ready to ship in November. I immediately plunked down $140.45 (with tax — it costs $129), and received a unit a few weeks later. It had problems right from the start. I downloaded the Home app to my Nexus 5X and expected a seamless experience. Not only was I using an Android phone, but I was using an Android phone made by Google. It's not the new Pixel, but it came out in 2015 — not exactly eons ago.  What I encountered was a frustrating setup process that only worked when the app seemingly felt like working. Ben Gilbert/Business Insider Over and over, the WiFi broke, rendering the device entirely useless. And if it's not connected to your home WiFi network, you can't do anything with Google Home — no Google requests, no music, nothing. This happened repeatedly across two weeks. I have a standard home WiFi network, with a highly-rated dual-band Asus router and an Arris Surfboard modem (that I own/don't rent from my ISP). I live in a small-ish Brooklyn apartment — the Home sits about 15 feet from my router. At any point, there are a maximum of six wireless devices in my home connected to the internet (and, more commonly, two or three). I even contacted Google's press line for help (the company also sent me a review unit, which I experienced the same problems with) to no avail.  This is not my apartment. I have much better taste than this.Google When Google Home did work, it's worryingly limited. It couldn't set reminders ("Sorry, create reminder is not yet supported.") It couldn't give directions or transit warnings ("Sorry, I can't give directions for public transit yet.") It seemingly has no idea that I have a personal or work calendar ("Sorry, I'm not sure how to help with that yet.") This is all stuff that Google Now does on my phone. In fact, Google Now is part of why I continue to use Android.  Every time it tells me something useful before I even realized I needed to know it — my boarding gate for tomorrow's flight, for instance, and then if there's traffic on the way to the airport — I marvel at its usefulness. Google Now is a strong argument for an entire phone OS. Darren Weaver Instead, Google Home is powered by a new AI assistant from Google called, "Google Assistant." The sell point with Google Assistant is it can do conversation-like stuff. Ask it, "Ok Google, how far is Mars from Earth?" and it gives you the answer. Then you can ask, "How about Pluto?" Presumably, if all goes perfectly, Google Assistant will keep the conversation going with an answer, passively understanding all the context in between. But in reality, this is something I rarely use. I need Google Home to do stuff for me — set appointments in my calendar, warn me that my train is going to be late so I should leave earlier, tell me about that concert I might've forgotten about. I need it to do stuff that Google Now already does successfully — at bare minimum. In this respect, it's a terrible assistant. Google The other thing it's supposed to do — be a speaker — is just okay. I have a Sonos Play 3 speaker, which is really, really good. It's loud, and has stunning bass depth considering how small it is. It's also significantly more expensive than Google Home ($299 compared to Home's $129). With that price comes a gigantic increase in quality — Home sounds tinny and cheap by comparison.  In the end, I returned my Google Home soon after buying it. Ben Gilbert/Business Insider If I can't trust it to consistently work, what's the point? It was already a luxury purchase — a lark on a brand new type of technology — and ended up being one that I couldn't justify spending $140 on. If I had stuck with Home, it's possible I'd enjoy it much more nowadays. Google Home now supports multiple users, interacts with Google Calendar, and does other (necessary) stuff it didn't do near launch. Still, I'm skeptical. There were major problems with Google Home even staying connected to my home internet, to say nothing of its inability to recognize my commands with consistency. Maybe I'd like the Amazon Echo much more, and maybe I'll give it a shot eventually, but in the meantime I'm going to wait for AI-facing consumer technology to improve dramatically. Perhaps Google has a big surprise for me this week at Google I/O 2017. Get the latest Google stock price here.

However, Volvo has taken this integration of Android a step further and eliminated the need for a smartphone at all. As part of its recently announced partnership with Google, the premium automaker has plans for its next generation of vehicles to feature an all-new infotainment system built around Android 7.0 Nougat, the operating system’s most recent version. FOLLOW DAILY NEWS AUTOS ON FACEBOOK. 'LIKE' US HERE. The upcoming infotainment system from Volvo allows for voice control of multiple operations like cabin temperature, windows, and seat positioning. It will feature a number of already popular Android applications as well as the addition of future ones. This includes those developed by Google, the automaker, and third parties. Perhaps most notable is the embedment of Google Assistant into the system, a first-time for automobiles. Volvo has announced its collaboration with Google to develop a next generation infotainment system built around the Android operating system. "With the advent of Android, we will embrace a rich ecosystem while keeping our iconic Volvo user interface,” Volvo’s Senior Vice President of Research and Development Henrik Green said. “We will offer hundreds of popular apps and the best integrated experience in this broad, connected environment." Although the automaker has given a roughly two-year timeframe for the release of the Android based system, it has more immediate plans with Google in the works. Volvo is collaborating with the tech giant to add Google Local Search to the current Sensus infotainment system found on its most recent models. More updates and live demonstrations of the system will be available at the annual Google I/O conference being held later this week.

Here we look at some techniques for ensuring that your event appears at the top of a potential ticket buyers search results. _______________________________ Guest post by Rachel Grate of Eventbrite For most events, search can be expected to drive between 5-10% of ticket purchases or registrations. But these sales aren’t automatic — it takes dedicated effort to make your event rank in Google search results. The average event can expect 5-10% of their sales to come through search CLICK TO TWEET   The key is Search Engine Optimization (SEO) or, put more simply, designing your event page to show up at the top of search results. Here are three basic principles to follow to get your event to rank on Google. Use descriptive keywords in your title and event summary Keywords — the words that a potential attendee would search on Google to find your site — are the heart of SEO. You’ll want to use keywords strategically on your event page, especially in your event name and description. Sometimes, this means putting creativity aside for a straightforward name. For example, if you host a beer festival, you want to make sure your event name has the term “beer festival” in it, since that keyword is searched nearly 3,000 times per month on Google. (You can find out which keywords have the highest search volume for your event using Google AdWords — find out how here.) Search engines know that events are timely and location-based, so they will use your event’s date and location to determine its ranking. That means you want to make sure the date and location are front and center in your event description. It’s also a good idea to repeat geographic terms like “Northern California” and “New York City” in your copy. You increase your chances of ranking even more if you include your city or state in the title of your event. For example, nearly 200 people search for beer festivals in Los Angeles each month. That means naming your event the “Los Angeles Beer Festival” or “Craft Beer Festival: Los Angeles” could pay off in major traffic. If you’re directing traffic to your own event page, make sure your domain name (or URL) also includes the keyword-optimized name of your event. Increase your “domain authority” to rank in Google One of the most important factors in your search rankings is your event website’s “domain authority” — a number that indicates how much Google trusts your site. There’s no instant way to improve your domain authority, but Google will trust your site more if you post new contentregularly. This content could take the form of blog posts or new events. You can check in on your progress by using Google Analytics. In many cases, it might be more valuable for searches to land directly on your ticketing and registration page — so event-goers can buy tickets or register right away. If this is the case, you want to choose a ticketing partner whose site has good domain authority. The higher your partner’s domain authority, the better shot your event has at ranking in search results. Eventbrite is one of Google’s top 100 most trusted sites — the only ticketing or registration page with a high enough domain authority to rank alongside sites like Yelp. Make your event page show up first on mobile searches More than half of Google searches happen on mobile — and mobile searchers tend to take advantage of “predictive search.” This is when Google tries to predict what a searcher wants before they finish typing. The most powerful form of predictive search is an Accelerated Mobile Page (AMP) search result. If you’ve ever started typing a search on your phone and saw a result appear under the search box with a lightning bolt symbol next to it, you’ve seen an AMP result. These are pages designed on the backend to load extremely quickly, so searchers can get their information before even pressing ‘Search.’ AMP pages are now used by the majority of major websites, including Pinterest, Buzzfeed, and The New York Times. And while there are no overarching statistics available, Slate saw a 73% increase in site visitors from Google mobile search when they updated to AMP pages. Eventbrite is the only ticketing company using AMP for all of their event pages. This means your event will automatically show up first — and fastest — when people search for your event on a mobile device. SEO is just one part of a comprehensive event marketing strategy.

There are many trade-offs to rooting your Android phone or tablet. The latest addition to the negatives column is losing the ability to stream videos from Netflix. Thanks to the inclusion of new digital rights management software, the latest version of the Netflix app won't work on devices whose Android OS has been rooted—the process of gaining access to system settings and other parts of the OS that Google and the device manufacturer intentionally blocked. If you have a rooted device and browse to the Netflix app on the Google Play store, you'll now see a notice explaining that the app is not compatible, AndroidPolice reported over the weekend. The change, according to Netflix, is intended to make it harder for people to pirate the company's video content by using a new digital rights management platform, or DRM. Related How to Watch Amazon and Netflix Offline How to Watch Amazon and Netflix Offline "With our latest 5.0 release, we now fully rely on the Widevine DRM provided by Google," Netflix said in a statement to Android Police. "Therefore, many devices that are not Google-certified or have been altered will no longer work with our latest app and those users will no longer see the Netflix app in the Play Store." As with any app update, there is a workaround for people who have rooted devices: simply don't update the app. That means losing out on improvements to the Netflix app, but such a trade-off might be acceptable for casual Netflix fans who really want root access to their Android device. Netflix's decision to strengthen its DRM comes after the company added the ability for subscribers to download certain shows and movies to their phones and tablets so that they can watch them on flights or other places without internet access.

SUBSCRIBE REPORT PAPERS EVENTS SURVEYS Digital Cities Digital Counties GOVTECH.COM DC_Logo Articles Webpass Seeks to Rival Cable, High-Speed Internet Customers can plug in their TV, router, laptop, game console or other device directly into Webpass and have connectivity. by Mike Freeman, The San Diego Union-Tribune / May 15, 2017 Twitter/Webpass (TNS) -- Cord cutting has taken a bite out of the number of pay TV subscribers for cable and telecommunications companies. But it hasn’t significantly reduced high-speed internet subscribers – in part because there aren’t many alternatives for over-the-top streamers. Webpass, now owned by Google, wants to be that alternative – even though today it’s a niche Internet Service Provider with a small footprint that is limited to apartments, condos and a few commercial buildings. RELATEDLegal Claim Asks Tacoma Power be Reimbursed for $21 Million in Subsidies to Click Cable TVThe Broadband Battle Is On in Kansas City, Mo.Fiber-Optic Broadband to Go Live in Northern Alaska This Year The San Francisco company is trying to elbow its way into the broadband business where others – from Google Fiber to Verizon FiOS – have had mixed results luring away customers from established cable and telephone company providers. But unlike these wireline, fiber optic deployments, Webpass delivers broadband wirelessly. Founded in 2003, the company uses a daisy chain of point-to-point wireless radios on the roof tops of apartment and condo buildings to serve up bandwidth. It also can tap into fiber optic lines coming into the building from the street. From there, Webpass taps copper Ethernet cabling behind the walls to deliver speeds ranging from 100 megabits per second to a 1 gigabit per second to customers. The cost is $60 a month. Speeds depend on the building infrastructure. There’s no modem or other equipment needed. Just an Ethernet jack in the wall. Customers can plug in their TV, router, laptop, game console or other device directly into the jack and have connectivity. “Regardless of what speeds you’re getting, it is the same price because we are giving you the fastest speeds your building will accommodate,” said Charles Barr, founder and president of Webpass. Webpass is only available in multi-tenant condos and apartments. It requires what’s known as Cat. 5 or better Ethernet wiring in the building, which are commonly referred to as Ethernet cables. “We try to make everything as simple as possible,” said Barr. “So the delivery method to the customer is copper cable. Anything can connect to it. You don’t need any specialized equipment. You just plug in and go.” Webpass operates in San Francisco/Oakland, Miami, Denver, Boston, Chicago and San Diego. It serves more than 800 buildings nationwide. The company targets complexes with 10 units or more. Webpass expanded into San Diego in 2013 and is now deployed in 175 multi-tenant buildings. Most are downtown. But Webpass also is in some complexes in Mission Valley, North Park, Coronado, National City, Pacific Beach, Normal Heights and other neighborhoods. It recently expanded into University City. A roadblock for Webpass is having to convince apartment and condo landlords to allow it to offer service in their buildings, which often already have cable or telephone company internet. “Webpass has to make the case as to why they are better, and of course many building owners are going to want a piece of the action,” said Erik Keith, principal broadband infrastructure analyst for industry research firm GlobalData. Webpass must ask permission from the landlord to come on their property. It then must negotiate a contract to offer service. “AT&T doesn’t have to ask permission,” said Barr. “I am immensely proud of having 175 buildings in San Diego. I could have 1,000 if I didn’t have this requirement.” Briar Belair, a Webpass user, said one of the biggest benefits is no long-term contracts. Customers pay month to month. After moving to a new building recently, she had to pay a six-month termination fee, even though her pay TV/internet provider didn’t offer service at her new building. “I couldn’t get service but still had to pay for it anyway, which is really frustrating from a consumer standpoint,” she said. “Webpass just ensures that won’t be happening.” Matt Brand, a cord cutter, has never used Webpass but is looking forward to getting it at the Vue on 5th, a 45-unit complex that opened last fall in Bankers Hill. Brand said he’s fed up with the sales tactics of cable and telecommunications outfits. “They say, we’ll do this deal for you for $100, and a year later I’m asking why am I paying $250 for this?” he said. “I call and say cancel it all. And they’re like how about we do it for $150?” Brand must wait a bit for Webpass, however. The general contractor that constructed Vue on 5th didn’t wire the building with copper Ethernet cable from the central connectivity point to individual units. The building owner, ColRich, has pledged to fix the problem. It’s working with the general contractor to add the wiring, the company said. Barr, the Webpass president, said there has been an uptick in the past year of new San Diego multi-tenant complexes excluding Ethernet wiring. He believes cable and telephone company providers are offering deals to builders to install fiber optic or coaxial cable wiring only behind the walls to keep Webpass out. “This is where the dirtiness of the internet industry becomes apparent,” he said. “That last step from the telecom closet to the customer’s unit is where the game is played right now.” Without Ethernet, Webpass either has to run new wires to the unit itself or pass on the business. “The worst market is Miami for this practice,” said Barr. “San Diego never used to do it, but in the past year it has picked up.” He continued, “I would say it is a construction defect if you don’t have the building wired for competition.” There are reasons for new buildings to drop Ethernet cables in favor of other options, particularly fiber optics, said Keith, the GlobalData analyst. They include reduced size and weight, lower power consumption and greater bandwidth capacity, which future-proofs the building’s connectivity infrastructure. “Fiber can go up to 10 gigabits,” he said. “Cat. 5, I don’t thinks so. Instead of a bundle of Cat 5, you have a single fiber or two fibers that weigh next to nothing.” Even so, Webpass argues that copper Ethernet is better than fiber for delivering high-speed broadband to each unit in an apartment or condo complex. “The hard part from a Webpass perspective is customers perceive fiber is correct and copper is wrong, and it is actually the other way around,” said Barr of Webpass. “Fiber is an excellent choice as the backbone of the internet. It is not an excellent choice to deliver to the end user.” Ironically, Webpass’ parent company tried to do just that with Google Fiber. But last year Google announced that it would “pause” plans to launch 1 gigabit fiber internet in nine new cities as it struggled with the costs of deploying fiber. Google’s purchase of Webpass last year has led to speculation that it might be considering wireless as a less expensive way to deliver bandwidth. “It is a viable alternative, in part because it reduces the monopolistic congestion at certain points of (wired/fiber) construction where conduit/power pole landlords make life hard or practically impossible to build out in a cost effective and timely manner,” said Cameron Camp, a security researcher at ESET who built point to point a wireless network in rural Southern Oregon. For traditional video/internet providers, cord cutting has been a growing drag on their subscribers. Bloomberg estimates that major pay TV operators lost 1.4 million video subscribers last year nationwide. But these cable and telecommunications outfits show few signs of losing their internet customers. They have been upgrading their networks to boost speeds to accommodate over the top streaming on Netflix, Hulu and other services. Cox Communications, San Diego’s largest cable provider, now offers 300 megabits per second service to every household in its footprint. It also is growing its deployment of Gigablast fiber to the home offering. “We hear a lot about cord cutting in the media, but every household is different,” said Suzanne Schlundt, vice president of global marketing for Cox. “What the numbers show is a majority of households are still choosing a paid video service. Our customers continue to see the value of bundling their video service with their internet service, their phone and now we have home automation and security.” Webpass eventually wants to expand its service not only to additional cities but also to single family homes, said Barr. But regulations need to change and technology needs to advance before that will be possible. “I would love to serve single family homes,” said Barr. “It’s a matter of technology and business processes that have to come together for us to be able to do it. But we are very focused on it.” ©2017 The San Diego Union-Tribune Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.

MAGAZINE EVENTS PAPERS TOPICS GOVTECH 100 NAVIGATOR SEARCH Social Facebook, Twitter and Google Feel Pressure to Report Terrorist Activity Congress is closely watching whether social media companies can solve the problem on their own. by Sean Cockerham, McClatchy Washington Bureau / May 15, 2017 Shutterstock (TNS) -- WASHINGTON — Are social media companies doing enough to police terror activity? Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., argues emphatically that they are not. The top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee is planning a new push to force social media companies to report “knowledge of terrorist activity” as relatives of victims in the 2015 San Bernardino, Calif., terror attack sue Twitter, Google and Facebook, accusing them of supporting extremists online. Social media companies are feeling heightened pressure to do more in the U.S. and abroad. A new report from the British Parliament asserts the Silicon Valley companies are “shamefully far” from taking the needed action to quickly remove terror-related content and should face major fines. RELATEDGoogle, Facebook Criticized for Spreading Fake NewsCan the Police Use Facebook to Investigate Crimes?Facebook Plans Changes to Combat Violent Live Streaming The escalating demands on companies like Google, Facebook and Twitter to censor or turn over information about their users raises major questions, though, about national security, privacy and how much power the government should have to know what you do on your smartphone. Eric Goldman, co-director of the High Tech Law Institute at Santa Clara University in California, questioned where service providers would draw the line if Congress forced them to report all “terrorist activity.” “What are the risks to innocent people who are mistakenly flagged as engaging in terrorist activities?” said Goldman, a law professor and former Silicon Valley lawyer. “Such a flag has the potential to destroy their lives based on a mistake.” Congress is closely watching whether social media companies can solve the problem on their own. Google, which owns YouTube, is taking a hit, with major advertisers pulling out after it turned out their ads were appearing next to extremist or hate speech videos. Facebook is adding 3,000 staffers under pressure to monitor content after Facebook Live was used to post a series of horrific acts, including a murder in Cleveland. Governments are increasingly frustrated with the growing use of encrypted devices or apps to mask content. The FBI reported to Congress last week that during the last six months alone it failed to unlock half the 6,000 phones or other devices for which it has search warrants or court orders to access the data. The Trump administration is concerned about the issue and debating what to do about it, according to the agency. “It is clear these issues are becoming increasingly problematic for law enforcement and that ultimately some sort of legislative solution will be required to address them,” said Susan Hennessey, a former National Security Agency lawyer who is a cybersecurity expert at the Brookings Institution, a Washington research group. Feinstein wants to work with the FBI on a measure based on child pornography statutes that would require tech companies to report online “terrorist activity” to law enforcement. Feinstein, who has the support of Republican senators such as Richard Burr of North Carolina and Marco Rubio of Florida, has tried before to force tech companies to act. She’s now in a stronger position as the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, the panel that has broad jurisdiction over internet issues. (EDITORS: STORY CAN END HERE) Feinstein is also talking about resurrecting efforts in Congress to require Silicon Valley companies to give law enforcement access to encrypted data when there is a court order. Apple refused a court order last year to unlock the iPhone of San Bernardino shooter Syed Farook. The FBI ended up spending $900,000 to hack into the phone. “I’ve gone out, I tried to talk to the tech companies that are in my state. One — Facebook — was very good and understood the problem. But most do not,” Feinstein said at a recent Senate Judiciary Committee hearing. Tech companies and privacy advocates counter that it’s dangerous for the government to demand “backdoor” access to encrypted information from phones and other technology that hackers and thieves can then exploit. Mark MacCarthy, vice president of the Software and Information Industry Association, whose members include Facebook and Google, said social media companies were constantly sharpening their efforts to block terrorist propaganda. He said the companies were “vigilant about conduct that creates an imminent danger to the public by reporting this information to law enforcement.” “While it is a legitimate concern that terrorist organizations are using social media platforms to spread their propaganda and recruit fighters, an obligation for social media companies and others to report undefined ‘terrorist activity’ to the government is a terrible idea,” he said. “It would create First Amendment issues and potentially place innocent people under government surveillance for protected expression while doing nothing to make us safer.” Pressure grows after each terror attack. Relatives of three of the 14 people killed in San Bernardino sued seeking monetary damages against Twitter, Google and Facebook in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. Courts have dismissed similar lawsuits under the Communications Decency Act, a federal statute that shields online providers from liability for what users post. “It has very low odds of success,” said Santa Clara University law professor Goldman. The lawsuit, though, could be more effective as a public relations attempt to pressure the companies into greater action — or to help prod Congress into deciding it is time to pass legislation forcing Silicon Valley’s hand. “For years, defendants have knowingly and recklessly provided the terrorist group ISIS with accounts to use its social networks as a tool for spreading extremist propaganda, raising funds and attracting new recruits,” the lawsuit claims. “Without defendants Twitter, Facebook and Google (YouTube), the explosive growth of ISIS over the last few years into the most feared terrorist group in the world would not have been possible.” ©2017 McClatchy Washington Bureau Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.

Topic Areas In 2017, we'll seek topics supporting our 2017 Strategy, working with Mozillians to refine these areas into specific topics: Grow Firefox & From Firefox e.g. user-centered design; user acquisition and retention; metrics & data; teamwork & collaboration; communication Grow New Arease.g. internet of things; artificial intelligence and virtual reality Grow Mozilla e.g. our Issues Agenda including Internet Health e.g. security and privacy, access Speaker Criteria We prefer speakers who: Have practical hands-on experience in their area of expertise (vs. just academic or consulting) Have significant experience public speaking and/or teaching, as well as in their domain of expertise Are willing to customize their material to Mozilla’s specific needs Motivate audiences to both learn and act (as distinguished from purely inspirational “TED”-like talks) Encompass diverse and underrepresented backgrounds, perspectives and geographies Are recommended by other Mozillians Do not promote a commercial or personal agenda The speaker(s) share live from a Mozilla office and are publicly streamed to Mozilla's other offices via Air Mozilla and archived for subsequent viewing. We encourage speakers to allot at least 15-20 minutes for Q&A. Typical in-person attendance at each office is 20-30; additionally roughly 100-200 other attendees tune in live remotely. Follow-on views are available to our thousands of community members and the public. Program Objectives The objectives of the Mozilla Speaker Series are to: Expose Mozilla staff to outside ideas, practices and technologies Facilitate learning, skill-building and professional development Testimonials "These events add real value to me as an employee, and as a citizen of the net." --April 2017 "I now have a much better understanding of the controversy surrounding the Snowden leaks and have an idea of what I can do as a private citizen to combat the government's use of mass surveillance." --April 2017 "The topic was compelling and the level of expertise of the speaker made the information received very credible and thus easy to find relevant to my work." --April 2017 "Today's speaker challenged my expectations of the internet and of corporate behavior and stimulated good office discussion." --March 2017 "I dislike most presentations. This was among the best I have ever watched." --March 2017 "SUPER INTERESTING talk!!! Glad I had the opportunity to hear Nir speak!" --March 2017 "Today's panel helped me focus on the core problem, which is NOT technology but rather what technology is enabling -- people being jerks and why the technology makes it seem to be OK." --February 2017 "Diversification of inputs makes design more inclusive and helps avoid problems like being wrongly bucketed in a certain demographic. Interesting modes of UX design include the unintuitive slowing down of user interactions, to prevent hasty life decisions based on a heightened emotional response. This is valuable because it is a well thought out piece of a design process - something that I feel like I can take away!" --February 2017 "Laszlo's points were made with enthusiasm, rigor and data. He didn't shy away from the fact the some of the problems are difficult." --January 2017 "AWESOME TOPIC AND ELEGANT SPEAKER, well done!!" --January 2017 "It's rare for companies to be really good at learning from that failure and being diligent in discussing it. Hearing that part of the talk was really valuable to me. I'll try to make a conscious effort to learn from failure." --November 2016 "The concept of reframing failure so others can learn and de-personalizing the sense of responsibility we feel was helpful." --November 2016 "Before Harlo's talk, I also hadn't thought much about the role of freelance journalists and the complexities of protecting people and data who don't necessarily have the shelter of large news organizations. I think there are some implications for Mozilla community there." --October 2016 "Genevieve showed us how designing data-rich experiences for humans often ignores important nuances and dualities that are present in life." --September 2016 "There are human choices built in to the design of our technology systems, and Genevieve provided some examples of this (e.g. turning off mail servers) that I will use." --September 2016 "The opportunity to reflect on the unchanging constants of human behaviour and contrast them with the technology-driven product decisions we often make was illuminating." --September 2016 "When building the next technologies of services, data sets, etc we need to ask ourselves if it plays into what is meaningful to the human race of family/friends, secrets/lies, community. Or we need to solve the challenges that have plagued us, time/reputation/forgetfulness. This is a great basis for Mozilla to start from when "prototyping the future." --September 2016 "The most important thing I learned from Tina was about framing the question, because I often assume that solving the 'function' is solving the problem, when it is not. Zoom out to fall in love with the problem." --July 2016 "Kevin was my favorite speaker yet! Thank you! It was very apropos to the direction we're going with Firefox being the 'personal browser.'" --May 2016 "Please keep it running as long as possible - it's an excellent forum!" --May 2016 "Kirsten was GREAT. I don't think the lessons folks learned as mid-level managers in explosively growing social companies apply to Mozilla. But I do think Wohlberg's lessons apply to us." --April 2016 "This series is really great. Focus on Product seems to be the theme and is a much necessary one for us now. Thanks for bringing them. It really helps." --March 2016 "April addressed some questions that were particularly apropos to a project I'm working on. It was interesting to see how Slack faced the same problem!" --February 2016 "Jocelyn's talk was brilliant. She presented a very insightful and productive way to reframe the conversation about release management. Just what we needed right now. Great choice!" --January 2016 "The speaker was very good, had thought-provoking ideas, yet delivered those ideas in a tasteful and relaxed way. I am likely to share and recommend my friends to go watch the video recording later." --December 2015 "This speaker was especially relevant and valuable because she provided tangible and actionable information in addition to being thought-provoking." -- October 2015 "Seeing speakers like this are really heartening to see at Mozilla. I think it will drive some really impactful change." -- September 2015 "Bringing in subject matter experts from the outside help us push our sometimes-bubble-like thinking. It's very easy to get caught up in our own 'laws' and constraints but hearing best practices such as Hitten will help us open our eyes a bit more. I'm excited because his presentation was spot on and hopefully expanded our horizons a bit." -- August 2015 "Really learned to think differently about a lot of things and also 'argument' differently when discussing new features or ideas. Always think about the user value, and how what you are working on will hinder or improve the user experience." -- July 2015 "This felt like the most interesting speaker so far, perhaps because it was directly relevant to our day-to-day work. He was also quite a good speaker, which helps. Getting people to talk about areas where we think we could do better or use a different perspective seems like a good general strategy." -- July 2015 "I love getting an outside perspective from an expert in an area. We spend a lot of time talking to ourselves so that outside perspective is awesome." -- May 2015 "The talk was engaging and the Paris employees loved the 'Brantina' idea and felt more a part of the conversation." -- May 2015 Upcoming Speakers Thursday, July 20, 2017: Are you an introvert? Working Across Personality Types with Jennifer Selby-Long Location: Mozilla San Francisco + Air Mozilla Time: 10am PT / 1pm ET / 5pm UT Topic: Engineers are introverted. Agile = meetings all the time. Works well for extroverts. Over the past year a few hundred staff at Mozilla have used the Insights Discovery tool to better learn about their individual personality temperaments, and to be more effective on their teams. But can these tests really help us? What’s the real science behind them? Can they be abused? Or are there ways they can help us work together better? On July 20, Jennifer Selby Long, an expert in the ethical use of the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator® (MBTI®), will lead us in a very interactive session on this material. She’ll help us explore these frameworks and the science behind them, with a focus specifically on their Introversion / Extraversion dimensions and workplace collaboration. Importantly, we’ll make it personal, rolling up our sleeves with some exercises to help us explore how our (and our team’s) MBTI preferences can help us work together better, regardless of job description, culture, or demographics. Hosts: Matt Frassica & Tyler Haugen Speaker: Jennifer Selby-Long Jennifer Selby Long is an executive coach, management consultant, and MBTI® expert who helps technology leaders navigate the challenges of seismic change to achieve their highest potential. She also advises on the impact of personality and gender on financial behavior. Jennifer is the past president of the Association for Psychological Type. She has been quoted by business and technology writers in the Fast Company, Information World, Dice.com, Univision, and the Bulletin of Psychological Type. She is an award-winning business writer and the author of Traveling Light, a blog helping leaders skyrocket their impact and lighten the load in their lives.

In the UK, 8 out of 10 homes host a range of microphones, cameras and motion detectors. They help users secure their homes, find lost items, assist with cleaning, keep an eye out for accidents and falls, and a hundred other everyday tasks. They're integrated so seamlessly into daily life that they're considered indispensable – and they're cheap. Of course, consumption habits ranging from entertainment, clothing and food are not only known, but anticipated by intelligent systems. These habits are also owned, captured, analyzed and used by the corporations that run them. Interestingly, just a few decades ago in the 1990s, the UK’s introduction of Closed Circuit TV (CCTV) met with significant public outcry over concerns of privacy abuses. Yet now, less than half a century later, we’ve not only abandoned such talks: we’ve opted in to 24/7 surveillance of our homes. In our May 10 “future retrospective,” we’ll look at how we - in 2027 - became so collectively compliant to others owning data about our personal habits and lives. What factors led to us to give so much of our lives to corporations, with so little transparency or accountability? Why were we more open to private surveillance than public surveillance? And when we return to 2017, what can we learn from this evolution to map a different future? Host: Sarah Allen Speaker: Adrian Hon Adrian Hon is CEO and founder at Six to Start, co-creators of the most successful smartphone fitness game in the world, Zombies, Run!. The game has won awards for its stories and storylike games, and the team’s work has been displayed at the MOMA and Design Museum in London. He’s the author of A History of the Future in 100 Objects, and he used to write about technology for The Telegraph. Previously, Adrian was Executive Producer and Director of Play at Mind Candy from 2004 to 2007, where he designed and produced the Perplex City alternate reality game (ARG). Adrian’s interest in ARGs began with the genre itself in 2001, when as a moderator for the Cloudmakers community for ‘The Beast’ (an ARG for Steven Spielberg’s A.I.), he wrote a detailed walkthrough for the game, called ‘The Guide.'

Because surveillance law has fallen behind surveillance technology, the U.S. government has unprecedented new powers. At our April Speaker Series, Jennifer Granick will address how Cold War programs led by J. Edgar Hoover and initiatives sparked by the September 11, 2001 tragedy have led us to today’s fusion centers and mosque infiltrators. She will also show how our current state of mass surveillance is fundamentally incompatible with a healthy democracy. A teacher, practitioner and expert in surveillance and security law, Granick will share how the reality of modern surveillance in the U.S. differs from popular understanding, and what U.S. - and global - citizens can do to minimize its negative impact both for Americans and non-Americans around the world. Host: Chris Riley Speaker: Jennifer Granick Jennifer Stisa Granick is the Director of Civil Liberties at the Stanford Center for Internet and Society (CIS) and author of American Spies: Modern Surveillance, Why You Should Care, and What To Do About It (2017). From 2001 to 2007, Granick was Executive Director of CIS and taught Cyberlaw, Computer Crime Law, Internet intermediary liability, and Internet law and policy. From 2007 to 2010 she served as the Civil Liberties Director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. Granick practices, speaks, and writes about computer crime and security, electronic surveillance, security vulnerability disclosure, encryption policy, and the Fourth Amendment.

But they don’t have to. They can - very easily - switch to another browser. But we know Firefox rocks and we want them to use it. Enter habits. Those human behaviors that become regular, ongoing actions that don’t require thought or intention. Or, per Merriam-Webster, “an acquired mode of behavior that has become nearly or completely involuntary.” Creating software that is habit-forming entails tapping into key human psychological drivers such as rewards, social validation and personal fulfillment. These drivers are at the foundation of developing experiences that drive product growth. Perhaps the biggest benefit is to software makers is significantly lower costs to acquire and maintain active users. But what about the user? Is it manipulative to create habits for people so they can use your products without giving it a conscious thought? To “get in their heads” to ensure they use our software? Do we want people to use our products involuntarily? Nir Eyal has built and invested in products reaching hundreds of millions of users including AdNectar, Product Hunt and EventBrite. He’ll draw on core psychological tenets to show how we can create products for users that are habit-forming. And he’ll show us how we can do this in a way that we feel good about - to “build the change we see.” Speaker: Nir Eyal For most of his career Nir worked in the video gaming and advertising industries where he learned, applied (and at times rejected) the techniques used to motivate and manipulate users. He writes to help companies create behaviors that benefit their users, while educating people on how to build healthful habits in their own lives. As an active angel investor Nir makes it personal, investing his own funds in habit-forming products he believes improves lives. His past investments include Eventbrite, Product Hunt, Refresh.io (acquired by LinkedIn), Worklife (acquired by Cisco), Marco Polo, Presence Learning, 7 Cups, Pana, and Symphony Commerce. Nir is the author of Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products and has taught at the Stanford Graduate School of Business and Design School. He’s sold two technology companies since 2003 and now helps teams design more engaging products. Nir talks of his advanced degree from the The School of Hard Knocks, but also received an MBA from the Stanford Graduate School of Business.

Its effectiveness as a public resource depends upon decentralized participation worldwide. — Excerpt, Mozilla Manifesto Mozilla cares not only about a functioning web, but a healthy one; a web where all people can both access and participate, resulting in an Internet that reflects the broad the diversity of its users. But the Internet isn’t always like this. Sometimes it's a place where groups of people are excluded. When Airbnb hosts deny service to guests based on their race, the web is no longer accessible. When neighbors make destructive assumptions based on race on local community site Nextdoor, or Twitter conversations devolve into trolling, the web is no longer a place of constructive participation. These companies want to make the web better too. Approaches include hashtag viewing controls on Twitter & filters for abusive comments on Instagram; Airbnb’s Instant Book that prevents harmful stereotyping; and Nextdoor’s reporting system designed to create more thoughtfulness around neighborhood conversations. Mozilla builds products and platforms directly for developers, communities and publishers worldwide. How can we create and sustain experiences that are open, accessible and participatory? And what measures of success can we advocate to support positive experiences for users, communities and publishers? At our Speaker Series panel, we’ll address these questions with product leaders representing consumer, developer, business and gaming audiences as part of a conversation around "ethical design” with community, product and engineering professionals charting new territory in this area. Panelists: Angel Steger (Product Design Lead, Pinterest) is an entrepreneur and product designer developing award-winning products that empower people to get things done. Passionate about complex problems and human behavior, she’s worked in spaces as varied as genetic research, relationship management, and language learning. She currently leads the User State Machine team at Pinterest. On the side, you’ll find her practicing yoga, exploring food in SF, and gardening. Randi Lee Harper (Founder, Online Abuse Prevention Initiative). Randi is founded the Online Abuse Prevention Initiative to fight harassment with technical solutions. This includes the Good Game Auto Blocker tool, built after a long career in tech (KIXEYE, Amazon, IronPort Systems). While Randi believes long term solutions involves cultural changes, but until that happens we can work develop shorter-term solutions to help targets of harassment. Current interests include tracking the way that certain communities interact, and helping define predictive behavior for outbreaks of online abuse.

Adopting an experiments-based approach with their people, his team was able to gather data challenging commonly accepted assumptions about hiring, compensation, performance evaluations, training and more. For example, in 2010 Google's research showed that junior, female software engineers were not getting promoted at the same rate as their male counterparts. Digging deeper, the team discovered differing self-nomination rates. Men, who in many cultures are typically more comfortable self-promoting, were nominating themselves at higher rates than their equally qualified but, on average, less self-promoting female peers. To address this, a senior leader shared the data with Googlers and encouraged all engineers to self-nominate when ready, and told managers to keep their eyes open for promo-ready Googlers. Eventually, promotion rates equaled out. Of course, Google isn’t Mozilla. For one thing, Google has over 60,000 staff in over 70 offices in 40 countries around the world. But the work and findings from Google - whose staff typically provide statistically-significant and rich data sets - can be useful references as we strive to create a Mozilla that is diverse, innovative and, at our core, puts people first. On January 18, Mozilla's Larissa Shapiro will interview Laszlo. She’ll dig deeper into the approaches and learnings Google has taken with people and data, and help us uncover how these types of approaches apply to the science and art of people management at mozilla. Speaker: From 2006 to 2016, Laszlo Bock served as SVP of People Operations, leading Google's people function responsible for attracting, developing, retaining, and delighting "Googlers.” He believes that giving people freedom and supplementing our instincts with hard science are steps on the path to making work meaningful and people happy. During Bock's tenure, Google was named the Best Company to Work more than 30 times around the world and received over 100 awards as an employer of choice. In 2010, Laszlo was named "Human Resources Executive of the Year" by HR Executive Magazine. He is the author of "WORK RULES! Insights from Inside Google to Transform How You Live and Lead," which has been named one of the top 15 business books of 2015. He has testified before Congress on immigration reform and labor issues and been featured in The Wall Street Journal, the New York Times, the PBS Newshour and on the Today Show. Bock's earlier experience spans executive roles at the General Electric Company, management consulting at McKinsey & Company, start-ups, non-profits, and acting. He (briefly) held the world record for Greek Syrtaki dance (along with 1,620 others). * Note: Laszlo dedicates all proceeds of his book to charities relating to education and veterans, the former mainly focused on giving disadvantaged kids better access e.g. Peninsula Bridge.

When you do your planning, you state what you'll achieve and measure those achievements. And when you are rewarded, it's typically for a job "well done.” Why even set goals, objectives or KPIs if you aren’t planning on succeeding? Because the best, most innovative organizations do more than set and achieve goals. They also fail. Failure is actually a by-product of innovation. It's the "risk" element of the "risk - reward” equation. Cue the emergence of global failure events and meet ups. As humans conditioned to win and succeed since birth, navigating how to “fail well" is hardly intuitive. What constitutes a "good failure"? And at what point do you decide you’ve failed, rather than persevere? Or change your direction e.g. the notorious ‘pivot’? In a world where success is rewarded and everyone is in the game to “win,” what does it mean to “fail well”? At our November speaker series, we will explore how Mozilla can be a place where failure is not minimized, denied, or shunned, but instead treated as a valuable source of learning and insight to set us up for future successes. Specifically, Ashley Good of Fail Forward will get us started with very practical insights into how we can: Craft a language of failure Communicate failure for learning Develop the gift of feedback Speaker: Working in Cairo with the United Nations Environment Programme and as a management consultant in Vancouver, Ashley Good saw how fear of failure inhibits innovation, adaptation, and performance. In response, she launched Fail Forward to spark a shift in how we perceive and talk about failure, and to help organizations learn, innovate and build resilience. Since 2010 Ashley has worked with organizations – from grantmakers and nonprofits to government and private sector companies – to use failure as a learning tool and culture driver to support and foster innovation. She is well known for building the Organizational Learning Team at Engineers Without Borders Canada, and she continues to lead their annual Failure Report. Ashley is a contributor to the Globe and Mail Leadership Lab, Public Sector Digest, and World Economic Forum Agenda. Her work has received coverage in a wide range of media and news outlets, including National Post, The Globe and Mail, CBC Radio and Television, The New York Times, and Fast Company. She is recognized by Harvard Business Review and McKinsey as the recipient of the Innovating Innovation Award, hosted Canada’s first ever conference dedicated to intelligent failure, and is a half-ironman triathlete. She earned her Bachelor of Science from the University of British Columbia with honours. Mozilla Host: George Roter Deck Questions: Submit questions during the event on IRC #AirMozilla. Hashtag: #mozSS October 12: Metadata is the new data... and why that (really) matters, with Harlo Holmes, Freedom of the Press Foundation Location: Mozilla Toronto + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Wednesday, October 12 @ 10:00am PT / 1:00pm ET / 5:00pm UTC Topic: Metadata is the new data ... and why that (really) matters Maybe it’s when the person you had a bad date with on Tinder shows up in your “people you may know” feed in Facebook. Or when you accept the default settings on your Android phone and share all of your transit habits with Google. Those moments might lead you to suspect considerable information about you and your behavior (aka “metadata”) is being harvested, shared and saved. But you had no reason to predict that. Nobody told you what was being gathered, or who it was being shared with. Or maybe they did, in a long, detailed unread terms of service. Today’s proliferation of mobile devices and platforms such as Google and Facebook has exacerbated this extensive, prolific sharing about users and their behaviors in ways most do not understand. Announcements about Facebook encrypting Messenger and WhatsApp appear to be encouraging ways of protecting your data... but they belie a different story of splintered approaches to metadata collection and silos among major platform providers. Similar disparities exist among how browsers treat metadata. So while the actual content of our messages may be encrypted, dangerous legal, financial, political and even medical implications to metadata remain. The impact of information about what you do (and when you do it) has yet to be explored or defined, let alone systematized. Fortunately mozilla is in a position to advocate for practices and policies that serve users first. We’ll hear specifically how from Harlo Holmes, Director of Newsroom Digital Security for the Freedom of the Press Foundation. Speaker: Harlo is the Director of Newsroom Digital Security at the Freedom of the Press Foundation. She strives to help individual journalists in various media organizations become confident and effective in securing their communications within their newsrooms, with their sources, and with the public at large. She is a media scholar, software programmer, and activist; and contributes to the open source mobile security collective The Guardian Project. She has helped journalists use tools to preserve their privacy and do their jobs better; is a member of Deep Lab, a collaborative group of cyberfeminist researchers, artists, writers, engineers, and more addressing issues such as privacy, surveillance, code and art; and was a Mozilla Knight Open News Fellow in 2014.

Not addressed were some of the unintended consequences of this progress. Facebook Live, Snapchat and Pokemon Go provide a few examples of how tech is outpacing our ability to socially (and legally) master it. Innovation unchecked can pose serious challenges to our very humanity. Best practices for user research and focusing on specific use cases have limited impact on our ability to shape the future we want. Dr. Genevieve Bell is responsible for corporate sensing and insights at Intel. She leads a cross-discipline foresights community that delivers insights into significant societal, technical and global trends. At Mozilla she’ll deliver what she terms “more of a meditation and conversation than a talk” on what it means to proactively preserve our humanity in a world that is increasingly digital. This sounds high level but it's also practical: we’ll learn about five things that don’t change and five things that do, and how paying close attention to them will help us be successful. Speaker: An accomplished anthropologist and researcher, Genevieve Bell joined Intel in 1998. During that time, she has helped drive Intel’s focus on user experiences and led various teams of social scientists and designers. She has been granted a number of patents for consumer electronics innovations throughout her career, with additional patents in the user experience space. She is the author of numerous journal papers and articles. She was named an Intel Fellow in 2008, a vice president in 2013 and a Senior Fellow in 2016. In addition to her position at Intel, Bell is a highly regarded industry expert and frequent commentator on the intersection of culture and technology. She has been featured in publications such as Wired, Forbes, The Atlantic, Fast Company, the Wall Street Journal and The New York Times. She is also a sought-after public speaker and panelist at technology conferences worldwide for the insights she has gained from extensive international field work and research.

Wired founder Kevin Kelly has an optimistic roadmap for the future, showing how the coming changes in our lives—from virtual reality in the home to an on-demand economy to artificial intelligence embedded in everything we manufacture—can be understood as the result of a few long-term, accelerating forces. These deep trends—flowing, screening, accessing, sharing, filtering, remixing, tracking, and questioning—overlap and are codependent on one another. And they will completely revolutionize the way we buy, work, learn, and communicate. By understanding and embracing them, it will be easier for us to remain on top of the coming wave of changes and to arrange our day-to-day relationships with technology in ways that bring forth maximum benefits. Join us as mozilla's John Jensen interviews Kevin on these trends: what exactly are they, how are they playing out in our world, and what can we do as technologists ourselves to ensure they contribute to the future we want. Speaker: Kevin Kelly is Senior Maverick at Wired magazine. He co-founded Wired in 1993, and served as its Executive Editor for its first seven years. His new book for Viking/Penguin The Inevitable will be released in early June 2016. He is also founding editor and co-publisher of the popular Cool Tools website, which has been reviewing tools daily since 2003. From 1984-1990 Kelly was publisher and editor of the Whole Earth Review, a journal of unorthodox technical news. He co-founded the ongoing Hackers’ Conference, and was involved with the launch of the WELL, a pioneering online service started in 1985. His books include the best-selling New Rules for the New Economy; the classic book on decentralized emergent systems, Out of Control; a graphic novel about robots and angels, The Silver Cord; an oversize catalog of the best of Cool Tools; and his summary theory of technology in What Technology Wants (2010).

Things like…deciding to develop an OS as well as a browser. And an app. Focusing on devices beyond phones. Changing our approach to advertising and content. Instilling an entire culture of experimentation and measurement across functions. These types of shifts can impact job roles, titles, tools - in short, they impact all the stuff of our daily work. Whether an organization is decentralized or command & control, these kinds of changes are never simple nor straightforward. There’s no silver bullets. And yet, when done thoughtfully and holistically, significant change management can make the difference between life and death of a product, an organization and its community. As a leader of major change efforts at PayPal, Salesforce and Charles Schwab, Kirsten Wolberg has moved a global organization to agile development and helped change the overall ownership of her organization. She'll draw off these experiences and share we might manage the changes happening at Mozilla. Speaker: Kirsten Wolberg currently serves as Vice President, Talent at PayPal, leading the talent acquisition, performance and learning teams. She also holds the role as Separation Executive for PayPal leading the PayPal separation program as part of the eBay/PayPal tax-free split. Kirsten was selected to lead the newly created Talent organization for PayPal to bring her deep background in technology, operations and transformational change leadership to the talent function. She is leading the innovation to reimagine Talent for the newly independent PayPal. Prior to her current roles she led the chief operating functions for PayPal Technology including technology strategy, planning, M&A, quality, transformation, employee engagement and the PayPal Open Source Office.

At what point are you ready to ship? What is the right product? How do you know when you’ve built it? And often more complicated than it sounds: who are your users? The best PMs are less product thought leaders and visionaries (though they certainly may be), but moreso shepherds of stakeholders and builders of processes to sort through these critical challenges. While they typically don’t produce tangible artifacts such as code or mockups, the ultimate success of the team and product can hinge on the effectiveness of the product manager. In short, product management done well helps make companies and products much better. But when done badly, it can significantly hurt a company and team. Speaker: As an investment partner at Greylock, Josh Elman invests in entrepreneurs building social networks and platforms, mobile apps, new media, and connected devices. Josh specializes in designing, building, and scaling consumer products, having been part of multiple companies that have grown to more than 100 million users. Before joining Greylock, Josh spent 15 years in product and engineering roles at leading companies in social, commerce, and media. Josh was the product lead for growth and relevance at Twitter, growing Twitter’s active user base by nearly 10x. Prior to Twitter, Josh worked on the platform at Facebook and led the launch of Facebook Connect. Josh was an early employee at LinkedIn and helped establish early models for user growth and launched v1 of LinkedIn Jobs. Josh also held roles leading product management for Zazzle, and product and engineering for RealJukebox and RealPlayer at RealNetworks. Josh currently serves on the boards of Medium, Meerkat, Operator, and Super. Josh also works closely with our investments in Nextdoor and Whosay.

Deck Host: Jim Cook, CFO, Mozilla Recommended pre-watch: Mitchell’s 2nd Portland Keynote on Decisionmaking October 22, 2015: Data as Empathy with Frances Haugen, Yelp Location: Mozilla Mountain View + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Thursday, October 22 @ 9:00am PT / 12:00pm ET / 4:00pm UTC Topic: Data As Empathy To build products people love, you must understand those people. User research and user-centered design help get us there, but once we have a sense of how our audiences think and behave, how can we go beyond the anecdotal to extrapolate to the macro? What ways can we better understand the needs of millions of users who think, act and operate differently than us? Our October speaker Frances Haugen will share from her product management and software engineering experiences with products used by millions of Google and Yelp customers. She'll help us understand how data - done 'right' - connects us to millions of users we don't know personally. And she'll outline what doing data right means for product development, and how product owners can build things their users love. Speaker: As both a Senior Product Manager, Software Engineer and Data Scientist for companies including Yelp and Google, Frances has worked at the intersection of data, design and humans throughout her career. An Electrical and Computer Engineering undergrad, Frances says she sees the world as comprised of hi and low cast filters. Host: Matt Grimes, User Advocacy Deck Questions: Submit questions for Frances during the event on IRC #AirMozilla. September 24, 2015: Should I Put it on Yammer? The Neuroscience of Online Communications with Deanna Zandt Location: Mountain View + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Thursday, September 24 @ 9:00am PT / 12:00pm ET / 4:00pm UTC Topic: “Should I put it on Yammer?” How do you respond when people at Mozilla ask you this? Do you sigh, roll your eyes, let out a small resigned laugh? Most of us know that many seemingly-benign posts (this one now the stuff of legends) can sometimes devolve into a debate nobody expected, necessarily wanted or knows what to do with. Not always, but enough to cause some communications platforms to be feared by some and occasionally counterproductive. This outcome, of course, is not confined to Yammer, nor is the behavior confined to Mozilla. Our September Brantina speaker, Deanna Zandt, has generously volunteered to speak with us about the neuroscientific dynamics of online communications. She’ll provide a deeper understanding of how our brains work when we’re engaged in online discussions which can help us communicate better, make better decisions, be more productive, and ultimately engage with more people driving richer, more dynamic outcomes. Speaker: Deanna Zandt creates and implements web strategies supporting civic engagement and cultural agency, drawing off her background in linguistics, advertising, telecommunications and finance. She’s worked with The Ford Foundation, Deutsche Telekom, Planned Parenthood, and Jim Hightower’s Hightower Lowdown; and has also advised the White House on digital strategy and public engagement. Deanna has been a regular contributor to Forbes.com, as well as NPR’s flagship news program, “All Things Considered” and is a frequent guest on MSNBC, CNN International, BBC Radio and Fox News. Host: Doug Turner Deck Questions: Submit questions for Deanna during the event on IRC #AirMozilla. August 13, 2015: Build, Measure, Learn: Being a Growth Organization with Hiten Shah, KISSMetrics Location: San Francisco + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Thursday, August 13 @ 9:00am PT / 12:00pm ET / 4:00pm UTC Topic: Hiten Shah will share his ideas and experience with growth hacking, a scrappy marketing technique developed by technology startups, and how it specifically applies to Mozilla. Larger companies that embrace this approach (examples include Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Airbnb and Dropbox) use creativity, analytical thinking, and social metrics to gain product exposure and grow their market share quickly. Speaker: Hiten Shah is cofounder and president of analytics companies KISSmetrics and Crazy Egg; he also advises startups. Host: Jascha Kaykas-Wolff Deck Questions: Submit your questions for Hiten in advance here, or during the event on IRC #AirMozilla. July 23, 2015: Rapid Prototyping with Tom Chi, GoogleX Location: San Francisco + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Thursday, July 23 @ 9:00am PT / 12:00pm ET / 4:00pm UTC Speaker: Tom Chi has worked in disciplines ranging from astrophysical research to Fortune 500 consulting to developing new hardware and software (web & client) products and services. He’s worked on large projects of global scale (Microsoft Outlook, Yahoo! Search), and scaled new projects from conception to significance (Yahoo! Answers from 0 to 90 million users). He also co-founded GoogleX, the semi-secret group responsible for cutting edge projects including the autonomous driving vehicles, contact lenses that monitor glucose through tears and balloons in the stratosphere that provide Internet access. Topic: Tom will talk about his approach to rapid prototyping using 'native' materials like paper and foam core to create and test experiences. Using this method, he has led teams to work more effectively and quickly, building state of the art (see above for examples) products as part of an ongoing innovation process. Host: Josh Carpenter Deck Workshop adapted from Tom's talk, from Mozilla Learning Network Questions: Submit your questions for Tom in advance here. May 21, 2015: Onboarding and Team Debt with Kate Heddleston Location: Mountain View + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Thursday, May 21 @ 9:00am PT / 12:00pm ET / 4:00pm UTC Speaker: Kate Heddleston, a software engineer in San Francisco, does a lot of speaking on the people-dimensions of software development and engineering management best practices. Her focus is on how software gets made, as well as on what it does. Topic: Kate shares her thoughts on the topic of onboarding new hires - what it takes to do that well, particularly in an engineering environment - and the 'team debt' that results when we do it poorly. Kate also shared some of the fairly immediate things individual teams can do to reduce the debt. Deck. Questions submitted to Kate in advance are here. Submitting a Speaker Idea We will give special consideration to speaker ideas submitted by Mozillians! Criteria for speakers is outlined above.

REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon    Lyft, Google Stir Up What Could Be Uber’s Worst Nightmare Eric Lieberman Tech and Law Reporter 4:06 PM 05/15/2017      Pinterest  Reddit  LinkedIn  WhatsApp     Share         TOP Lyft is reportedly joining forces with Google to further develop self-driving car technology, while Google and Uber remain engaged in a heated legal battle. Lyft and Waymo confirmed the deal to Mike Isaac of The New York Times in a Sunday report. While the business agreement generally shows how so many tech companies are racing for the first marketable and completely autonomous vehicle, it also could be a sign that Google wants to one-up Uber. (RELATED: Apple Signals It Wants In On The Self-Driving Car Race) The two tech giants are currently locking horns in a contentious lawsuit in which Google is accusing a former high-level employee of taking precious data to start his own startup, which Uber then purchased. Google alleges that Anthony Levandowski, co-founder of Otto and VP of Engineering at Uber, was secretly building another company while working and making $120 million in incentives at the company. Specifically, it claims that Levandowski, one of the original members of Google’s self-driving car initiative, “downloaded over 14,000 highly confidential and proprietary design files for Waymo’s various hardware systems” roughly six weeks prior to resigning from the company. Waymo and Google also claim that he downloaded several files, including trade secrets and blueprints. The new partnership seems to indicate that Lyft sees an opening for it to capitalize on the self-driving market as Uber is forced to focus on the lawsuit as well as a litany of other scandals. “Waymo holds today’s best self-driving technology, and collaborating with them will accelerate our shared vision of improving lives with the world’s best transportation,” a Lyft representative told The NYT in an official statement. The Daily Caller News Foundation reached out to Google to see if their deal with Uber’s main rival was a purposeful “middle finger” to the larger ride-hailing company, but the tech conglomerate did not respond by the time of publication. (RELATED: Lyft Raises $600 Million As Lane Opens With Uber’s Troubles) The legal proceedings that have transpired thus far have been unique. The name of one of the cofounders of Otto was mistakenly revealed after court documents failed to completely conceal all aspects of his identity in the lawsuit. The clerical mistake, specifically the lack of redaction, unraveled Uber’s efforts to keep the executive out of the spotlight. While not absolutely extraordinary, Levandowski repeatedly used his Fifth Amendment rights during initial legal proceedings, after lawyers advised him to not say anything out of fear incriminating himself.

Our Humanity By Rod Dreher • May 15, 2017, 4:15 PM Tweet Mark Zuckerberg loves you and has a wonderful plan for your life (Frederic Legrand – COMEO/Shutterstock) Most of us love the Internet because we can get lots of neat things for free on it. Like music, for instance. Here’s a short piece about the new head of YouTube and his relationship with the music industry. He promised to work hard to stop uploading of copyrighted content. But a simple search of YouTube will show that there is still a major problem with illegally uploaded content on the service. Searching for “full albums” will pull up classic albums like Bob Marley’s Legends, Nirvana’s Nevermind, and A Tribe Called Quest’s Low End Theory, as well as new releases like John Mayer’s The Search for Everything, and Humanz by the Gorillaz, which points listeners to an illegal download link in the event the album is blocked by Warner Music Group. And that’s just the first page of results. A deeper search pulled up immensely popular albums from the ‘00s like 50 Cent’s Get Rich or Die Tryin’, Lady Gaga’s The Fame, and Katy Perry’s One of The Boys, as well asE•MO•TION by Carly Rae Jepsen, the last two albums from both Jessie J and ArianaGrande, and Imagine Dragons’ entire catalog. You might be thinking, “So what? How does that hurt me? I get great music for free.” Well, it’s stealing. I make my living in part by writing books. What if my work were available for free online? Aside from the money taken out of my pocket dishonestly, there would be very little incentive for people to try to make careers in writing. Writing is hard work, and you usually do it for little monetary reward. If you knew that the moment you published something, it would be taken and given away for free, you would be much less inclined to do that thing, and certainly you would find it much harder to make a career doing it. We are so used to thinking about things in terms of consumer satisfaction that we don’t fully grasp what’s at stake in the economic and cultural model being built around us. The book to read now is Move Fast And Break Things: How Facebook, Google, and Amazon Cornered Culture and Undermined Democracy. Its author is Jonathan Taplin, director emeritus of the Annenberg Innovation Lab at USC, and a man who has spent his life working in the top ranks of film and popular music. The YouTube theft is exactly the kind of thing he’s talking about. This goes far beyond music, to the very core of our society. We are so obsessively focused on the now that we are not thinking about “the arc of history and culture” — and what we are losing. Let me explain. Move Fast tells the story of how those three companies — Facebook, Google, and Amazon — have established a virtual monopoly on news and creative content, and what that means for artists and for the public. Taplin writes: To be a young musician, filmmaker, or journalist today is to seriously contemplate the prospect of entering a profession that the digital age has eroded beyond recognition. We all know the story of how the Internet has more or less destroyed newspapers and bookstores. What is less well known to the general public is how it has destroyed the music business. Taplin tells the very personal story of the late Levon Helm, his friend, and how the digitization of the music business (and the royalties model it created) impoverishes artists. Did you know that artists make next to nothing from their tracks being heard on Spotify? “One hundred thousand people listen to your track,” writes Taplin, “and you make less than $500.” This is a great deal for consumers, Taplin says, but a terrible one for artists, musicians, writers, and other creative types. It has never been easy to make money in creative fields, but the structural barriers now are almost insurmountable, as Taplin explains. His argument goes beyond that. More: Monopoly, control of our data, and corporate lobbying are at the heart of this story of the battle between creative artists and the Internet giants, but we need to understand that every one of us will stand in the shoes of the artist before long. Musicians and authors were at the barricades first because their industries were the first to be digitized. But as the venture capitalist Marc Andreessen has said, “Software is eating the world,” and soon the technologists will be coming for your job, too, just as they will continue to come for more of your personal data. Taplin warns that “the techno-determinist path will ultimately lead to deep social unrest.” He’s right about that. Jonathan Taplin agreed to speak with me on the phone recently about his book. Below are slightly edited (for clarity) excerpts of our conversation, interspersed with passages from the book. I’ve been meaning to write about this for weeks, but I misplaced my marked-up copy of the book, and only just found it. RD: Nicholas Negroponte’s argument in his acclaimed 1995 book Being Digital was that digitalization would “decentralize control and harmonize people.” Those are literally his words. But that’s not what happened, right? JT: You had to get the scale really quickly, and you had to own the whole system. Peter Thiel says that monopoly is really the only way to make money in a digital business. Both Google and Facebook are monopolies. What ended up happening was that we ended up re-centralizing the Web completely. These two companies, plus Amazon, are really the only ways people get their information. They become these funnels through which every publisher, blogger, has to get their information out through them. This is what you call a monopsyny [a market situation in which there is only one buyer — RD]. Can you give an example? In the year 2000, when iTunes was really beginning to happen, if you sold a million copies of a song on iTunes, you as the musician or rights owner could make about $900,000. If you sell a million streams on YouTube today, you can make about $900. That stream has basically impoverished everybody but the Taylor Swifts, Beyonces, and JayZs of the world, who make most of their money through tours. I ran this thing called the Annenberg Innovation Lab, where our theory was that by the end of next year, there will be five billion smartphones in the world. But today they’re saying that you can’t make any money off of digital files anymore. There’s an old saying: if you’re not paying for it, you’re not the customer, you’re the product. This is a new form of capitalism. I call it monopoly surveillance capitalism. I spent two days at the beginning of this week at the University of Chicago, at a conference on monopoly. Even the most conservative economists at Chicago had to admit that the fact that two or three organizations have a monopoly on the data on your life create problems as a society that we have never had to think about. An aside: a business like Amazon is in a position to dictate to content producers. In Move Fast and Break Things, Taplin gives an example using my friend and former boss: In June of 2009, James Moroney, publisher of the Dallas Morning News, testified in Congress about his negotiations with Amazon over publishing the newspaper’s content on the Amazon Kindle. Amazon demanded 70 percent of the subscription revenues, leaving him with 30 percent to cover the cost of creating 100 percent of the content. This, he noted, could hardly be characterized as a fair business deal. No, it cannot. Shortly after my book The Little Way of Ruthie Leming was published in 2013, Amazon got into a big fight with Hachette, the publisher. Amazon played hardball, and started delaying delivery for Hachette titles. Customers who wanted to buy Little Way from Amazon were told that it would take six weeks to deliver the book. Sales dropped. They were doing this to all Hachette authors … because they could. This is what it means to have the book retail market bigfooted by a monopsyny. Again, you may think, hooray for Amazon, getting cheaper prices for consumers, but one downside of this is that one mega-corporation has this kind of power over the distribution of books. Once they have destroyed all the bookstores, what then? Another quote from the book: If 1999 was the high point of the music business, the onset of Napster and all the pirate sites that sprang up after it was shut down was the low point. Those sites turned the recorded music industry from a $20 billion business to a $7.5 billion business. Imagine if any other industry had been cut by two-thirds because of counterfeiting. Back to the Q&A with Taplin: Are we at the mercy of technology-driven markets?  No. It’s not like they can’t deal with this. There’s no pornography on YouTube. When somebody tries to upload that on YouTube, the computer shunts the images to a place where a human has to look at. They could do that with almost anything. They have the technology. They don’t want to because it violates their business model. What’s especially interesting about your book is that you demonstrate how these economic and technological forces really are waging a highly consequential war on culture.  The idea of community at a local level, of going to someone’s house and having three or four people sit together and sing, that gives me as much pleasure as any record I’ve bought in the past five years. What’s sad is this country used to have many regional music scenes. I remember traveling with Bob Dylan and the Band back in the day. If you went to San Antonio, the music was distinctly different from the music in New Orleans. The New Orleans music scene was distinctly different from the music scene in Memphis. And so on — there were all these regional scenes. Now we essentially have a mall culture. We’ve wiped out most of these music scenes. There’s a small nub of the hip hop scene that holds on to some regionalism in places like Atlanta and Dallas, but that’s like the last vestige of anything that says ‘I know where that comes from, I know what that speaks from.’ Taplin is not a Luddite, certainly, but he says that we must not praise disruption for the sake of disruption. He writes, “Disruption of critical cultural infrastructure is only worthy if the replacement is more beneficial to the society at large than the original institution was.”   Consider what is likely to come, and come quickly, to our society as the result of automation. Here’s a clip from the Q&A: The issue is that robots and artificial intelligence are coming pretty quickly. Unless there is a resistance, it will just plunge ahead. And then at some point, we’re going to have to deal with this issue. People like Marc Andreesen and bother ig venture capitalists said that the robots will hold all the stupid jobs, but we’ll just invent jobs that we don’t know about yet for the unemployed people. I don’t think that’s true. If you’re a 50 year old auto worker replaced by a robot in the GM plant, you’re not going to go train yourself to be a hotshot coder and go work for Google. They’re not going to hire you. They don’t want old people. They want young kids who will work 85 to 90 hrs a week and live on Pepsi and pizza. I think the uprising will come from the people who voted for Trump, but who are going to realize in two or three years that the jobs aren’t coming back. They’re going to be pissed off when they realize that they’ve been sold a bill of goods. We’re not only losing an economic model that holds society together, but we are also embracing cultural amnesia, Taplin maintains. And as he writes in the book, “Cultural amnesia only leads to cultural death.” From the Q&A: One of the saddest things being a professor – my basic courses were called Technology, Entertainment, and Art – what was really sad for me is that most of my students had very little historical knowledge of what happened in America, but they also had very little cultural knowledge. They knew nothing about Louis Armstrong, for example. He’s one of the most important American artists who ever lived. These kids had no idea who he was, and honestly, not a deep desire to find out, either. That’s a problem. I cite Gabriel Garcia Marquez saying, “I cannot imagine how anyone could even think of writing a novel without having at least a vague idea of the 10,000 years of literature that have gone before.” If you study Hemingway and Fitzgerald, they read everything they could get their hands on from the past. It helped form them. But today, young people don’t know what they don’t know, and they don’t really care. It’s discouraging. I told Taplin that even though I’m a cultural conservative and he is not, most of what he writes about in Move Fast and Break Things resonates deeply with me. I asked him if he identified in any way with cultural conservatives. Taplin replied:     I would say that in some sense I am a conservative, in the sense that I want to conserve a culture that I think is dying. The biggest star on YouTube until he blew up was Pewdiepie. His whole shtick was to play video games, and people would watch him play video games, and he would grimace. This guy had more followers on YouTube than Beyoncé![Note: He currently has over 55 million followers. — RD] This guy had no talent for anything. To my eyes, this was so symbolic about the end of a culture. In the sense that I worry about us destroying what’s good and what’s profound and what’s deep, then I guess I’m a conservative. Where I differ is that I have friends who have deep gay relationships in my church, people who have been together for 20 years, and so I cannot think that they are bad. I’m one of those “everybody’s in” Christians. That’s where I tend to break with what most people think of as a  ‘culturally conservative’ viewpoint. Still, I said, there’s a tremendous amount of overlap between people like you and me, both profoundly concerned about what the ideology of consumerism is doing to our culture. Taplin responded: Perhaps there’s some kind of meeting of the minds here. You used the word consumerism. If we all have mall fever, that’s not helping anything. That’s not helping us make any progress as a society. The problem I’m trying to confront is quite frankly, the people who make advertising are getting better and better at embedding into your head the ability to deliver a message to you at just the point where you think you’re hungry. It’s frightening. In my book, I talk about how Amazon and Google are putting speakers in your home that have microphones on all the time so they can absorb more consumer data about you to make you want things you don’t even know you want. Is that the world we really want to live in? My daughter lives down in New Orleans. She’s a capital appeals lawyer. Her job is to go once a week to Angola State Penitentiary to talk to her clients on death row. She found that her church and her ability to get away from social media was the only way for her to keep her head on straight. Ray Kurzweil thinks that the idea of the chip in your brain will be a great thing. Google will now be forever embedded in your brain, and you won’t actually know whether you’re using your computer and your brain. You will eventually cease to understand what’s you and what’s your advice. I want to resist that.       So do I. In the chapter of the book that spoke most directly to me, Taplin asks, “What does it mean to be human?” — especially in “the age of digital addiction.” Taplin cites research showing that neuroscientists are working to create Internet apps and suchlike designed to hook users. In talking about this by phone, I told Taplin about Columbia professor Tim Wu’s recent observation (in his great book The Attention Merchants) that William James had it right: we are what we pay attention to. I mentioned Wu’s unusual praise for monks, who share the same insight into human nature, and who build their lives around habits and techniques to focus their attention rightly. It turns out that Jonathan Taplin and I agree that the Benedictine monks have a lot to teach us in the resistance. In his book, he writes about how much he learned from a retreat at the New Camaldoli Hermitage, a Benedictine monastery in northern California. There is no cell service or wifi there. Taplin writes: Aside from the chanting of the monks in the chapel, no words are spoken there — which is of course the point. At home I am just as guilty as anyone of trying to watch TV, check my email, and talk on the phone at the same time. But I think we all have to take vacations from our devices. … I am not a Catholic, yet I find the monks’ prescriptions to be helpful, a model of how I want to live in the world. The idea of an examined life is missing in our current digital rush. Perhaps following the monks’ example of devotion to their community would be too much of a sacrifice for most of us, but when I was immersed in their fourteenth-century songs my mind kept wandering to the events that had occurred two seeks before in Charleston, South Carolina, where nine church parishioners were killed y a racist kid named Dylann Roof. When you think that the families of the slain churchgoers were able to forgive the shooter, you can only marvel at the power of their faith. Never was the difference between community cooperation and individual separation more starkly outlined. I’m not sure my faith would afford me that amount of grace in the face of such evil, but I am awed to see it exist in this hateful political climate we inhabit. I kept thinking of how powerful this sense of community was. Yes. Yes! The connectedness we all experience online is only a simulacrum of real community. And, “being human” is not “fulfilling all desires,” but rather requires contemplation, discernment, and the control of our desires. We have built and are building a world where that is less and less possible. Read Move Fast and Break Things. This book is prophetic, and key to understanding the dynamics driving our culture off the cliff. We make heroes of our destroyers, and we don’t understand what we’re doing. This is not a left vs. right problem. This is a challenge that implicates every one of us.   Posted in Consumerism, Culture, Decline and Fall. Tagged Amazon, consumerism, Facebook, Google, Jonathan Taplin, Move Fast And Break Things.

Our Humanity collin says: May 15, 2017 at 4:43 pm I understand the laments here but Toplin is rose colored glass on past history compared to today 1) When was the music industry ever kind to musicians that weren’t in the top .01%? Most of history, musicians (think Chuck Berry here) made money off of touring. What has collapsed is the music middleman the last 15 years not the artist. 2) I suspect it is easier to get published today than 15 years ago with all the industry dominated by ~5 publishers. (Although just getting published does not pay as well.) 3) What the heck is wrong with somebody making it as Youtube video player? Seems fine by me. 4) Look at the increase of documentary movies and new technology has made a lot easier with distribution. In reality, there has been a lot good with the internet in terms of understanding the world. If I want to find out what is happening in Iran, I can read Al Jazzera, etc. instead having the MSM force feed me. If I want conservative viewpoints of different healthcare, there are lots of good reads. And I bet as a population total that the young millenials probably are the best read in history. Egypt Steve says: May 15, 2017 at 4:50 pm Break up monopolies. Enforce anti-trust laws. Use copyright laws to protect authors and creators, not corporations. Tax the internet to create a royalty fund for musicians and authors. But what conservative will go for any of that? It sounds like a lot of socialistic, job-killing regulation. Which is why I’m for it, of course. Charles Cosimano says: May 15, 2017 at 4:56 pm Adapt or die. We are watching evolution at work. Piracy is an unsolvable problem. Stopping it is like attacking a cloud. Close down one site and a new will appear. This is the reality we live with. What will probably happen with writing is that it will once again become the province of those who have other sources of income and just do it for the love of it. I was in print for years, dealing a crazy publisher and never getting an honest accounting. That is just the reality of how things were if you were in a fringe area. Finally I got disgusted with and used the new internet to sell my own product. That worked fine (when I started I could bring in more money in a day that I would from all the years I was in print combined) but ultimately the pirates made it a waste of time as an income source and I decided to just give it all away, thus getting a boatload of free PR for other projects and ending up as a well, cult leader. That works really well a few levels. I’m the black sheep of what I do but even people who hate my ideas say, “But he has made all this info free.” My sins are scarlet but my books are read. The result is that my stuff has been spread in far more directions than it would have been had it been confined to the “Newage” section of Barnes and Noble. All this means is that while there may be some fascinating and unpleasant culture shifts because of the internet, it has paved the way for the triumph of Cosimanian Orthodoxy. Will harrington says: May 15, 2017 at 5:01 pm Yes this, and this is why I don’t worry about Trump. Why waste my time worrying about a mere President when all of this is trying to take over the world? Pat says: May 15, 2017 at 5:11 pm The only part of this I can speak to is Amazon vs. traditional publishing. For someone like you, Amazon may be the big bad – but for a lot of authors, it looks like our only friend. Traditional publishers in my genre take years to respond to a submission and if they do buy it they expect you to do all the marketing yourself. Then they take 70-85% of the money – for, basically, what? The cover? Amazon, on the other hand, not only makes self-publishing easy but gives the author a fair deal. This is why I am not only seriously considering self-publishing my novels in future, I am making an effort to read more self-published books. Yes, Amazon is a monster – but it’s a monster in my corner. Chris in Appalachia says: May 15, 2017 at 5:14 pm I don’t care if there is any new music or art or writing ever again. I don’t like anything after 1999 (the year not the Prince song). Besides, people like my photography, and I have made some money from it. But I gave up trying to police the internet and stop the theft of my work. The bottom line is if you put content of any sort out there, especially online, but analog, too, its going to get copied and spread around. The only way to stop the theft is not create any content. Keith says: May 15, 2017 at 5:24 pm *cough* From “The Internet Vs. Our Humanity”, Well, it’s stealing. I make my living in part by writing books. From “Stop Demonizing The White Working Class”, It’s behind a paywall, but I got to it through news.google.com. [NFR: Oh, sick burn. Nailed me. — RD] Ken'ichi says: May 15, 2017 at 5:32 pm “I think the uprising will come from the people who voted for Trump, but who are going to realize in two or three years that the jobs aren’t coming back. They’re going to be pissed off when they realize that they’ve been sold a bill of goods.” Right-wing Americans keep saying things like this, that some portion of the common masses are going to become more angry, become “pissed off”. To which I say, so what? Let them become “pissed off”, let them get angry, let them hate the elites that rule them with every fiber of their being. What can they do, except stew impotently in that anger? As Thucydides said, “the strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must.” You are the weak, the powerless, and all you can do is suffer whatever the left elites deign to inflict upon you next. Barring a foreign overthrow of your rulers, this will simply continue — death is your only escape. suburbanp says: May 15, 2017 at 5:57 pm I do love that this post about the destruction of culture due to people wanting to consume content for free is just above a post where you direct readers how to get around a paywall to read an article. “It’s behind a paywall, but I got to it through news.google.com”… Mason C. says: May 15, 2017 at 6:17 pm It’s funny how often “prophets” aren’t foretelling the future so much as saying what is already plainly evident but no one notices. I don’t say that to cheapen Taplin’s insights. Seeing clearly what everyone else should be able to see is a gift of surprisingly surpassing rarity. Case in point, one nightmare scenario is already unfolding with Amazon. Here’s an article from Brian Goulet, who runs an online store for fountain pens, describing why he won’t be opening an Amazon storefront anytime soon. Note that it’s from 2010. http://blog.gouletpens.com/2010/09/lets-talk-amazon.html Goulet argues that Amazon’s basic method is to get a niche online store to set up a storefront with Amazon, and therefore end up doing all the work required to advertise, purchase inventory, and handle sales through Amazon, while Amazon takes the lion’s share of the profits. Then, once Amazon has enough data about what sells in that niche market, they start selling their own inventory at prices that drive the original niche seller out of business. Again, you might say “So what, cheaper prices are better. If Goulet can’t compete with Amazon that’s his problem.” Here Mr. Goulet makes an excellent example for a counter argument. The only place Amazon might ever be able to compete with Goulet is price. The customer service that GouletPens offers is legendary in his niche market. My first purchase with him was only about $15 of notebook paper and ink samples and it came carefully packaged with a handwritten thank you note and a piece of candy. I’ve not had any issues with them but everyone says they are eager and willing to fix any problems. On top of that, Brian Goulet is a major reason fountain pens are as accessible as they currently are. He has been publishing reviews, how-tos, glamour shots of inks and pens, and answering Q&As for years. His website is as much a library as it is a storefront. Where, pray tell, is the equivalent on Amazon’s website? And retailers like that used to be everywhere, selling all kinds of things. They didn’t have websites obviously, but their stores were as much works of passion as they were of profit. (Of course, there’s always been those just out for a profit too.) My point though is that big business, Facebook, Google, and Amazon especially, have a vested interest in convincing us that “cost” is calculated only with dollar amounts. “You’ll spend less with us” they, truthfully, coo in our ear. But it’s not the whole truth. We spend less, yes, but the products cost more than just money. QuinDuke says: May 15, 2017 at 6:18 pm I hate feeling like a scold, but it’s interesting that this post discusses the writer’s income and what music-sharing sites did to the music industry, and the previous post mentions that a writer’s work is behind a paywall and suggests a method for going around it. Deplorable Me says: May 15, 2017 at 6:21 pm Rod, we just tried to order a pizza and got the “welcome to Verizon Wireless” message, the one that means the computer at one end or the other–the pizzeria’s, in this case–is (bleep)ed. Couldn’t order on their web site, either. Wait till this happens to all or most of the Internet. Sean Mitchell says: May 15, 2017 at 6:29 pm A few years ago, I attended a seminar about digital technology. One of the speakers from Silicon Valley talked about “East Coast Rules” (i.e the Law) and “West Coast Rules.” His basic point was that “West Coast Rules” will eventually be the rules that we live by, irregardless what law makers decide. To me, that was a pretty scary thought. Facebook, Google, Amazon are monopolies and, as such, a threat to our democracy. I wish our political leaders understood the threat, but they’re too busy taking their lobbying money and campaign contributions. redbrick says: May 15, 2017 at 6:40 pm Looks like we are all going to be Amish soon. I mean in the sense that at some point….computer chips in the brain….surgery to change our genetics….Christians will have to say no….this point is a technology point to far. The Amish just got off the out of control tech train before us by rejecting cars and in-door lights. Jack Harllee says: May 15, 2017 at 6:44 pm Ironic that your link for his book is to Amazon. You might at least link to Barnes & Noble. Gromaticus says: May 15, 2017 at 7:12 pm We are so obsessively focused on the now that we are not thinking about “the arc of history and culture” For example…I’m fifty-three years old, the economic model of singer-songwriters recording albums and selling them to the public at a level of compensation that allowed them to live the lifestyle of the artists mentioned in the first quote both arose and died off in my lifetime. The disruptive technologies of hi fidelity recording and stereo equipment eliminated the market for the part time semi amateur dance bands that my grandfather played in from the thirties until the late fifties. Point being, it strikes me that this type of thinking is less about the arc of “history and culture” then lamenting the loss of what was “the now” five minutes ago. Pepi says: May 15, 2017 at 7:19 pm There are so many sides to much of this. Music. Yes, the pirating issue is huge and impacting artists but at the same time, youtube is the biggest driver behind independent artists that are building their own audience and crowdfunding their art (see patreon.com). For examples of this, check out a cappella groups like Pentatonix, Home Free, Philharmonic, etc. Books. Same thing. Yes, Amazon has squeezed publishing houses terribly but at the same time has provided a platform for people to self-publish and lots of people are making a living that way. Bookstores. I have some pretty obscure interests and have pursued those interests via books from Amazon. I would not have had any way of knowing that they even existed before. They would not have been available at the bookstores in the cities 2-3 hours away nor even in the universities in my state. The disciplines involved have hobbyists across the nation now and certainly books in the field sell far more copies than they did before Amazon provided “look inside” capabilities. Community. Again, you’re right but… I have a rare medical condition and I have never known, in “real life” a single other person with it but I am a member of a Facebook group of people who struggle with the same challenges. We support each other and you would not believe how often we hear “I am so glad I found you! It has made all the difference in the world!” Not only that but we tell each other the information that we need to get adequate medical care. It is critical that we do so because we do NOT get it from our doctors and surgeons! Like all other “progress” in human history, there are losses and there are gains and often times, whether something is a loss or gain depends on the choices of the individual. I was thinking recently about Indigenous Americans (i.e. Indians) and their cultures. It was the opposite of consumerism but we see our culture as “superior” because our technology defeated them. The same drive to create, improve, exploit, consume and innovate that allowed us to “conquer the West” is what is driving us to an unsustainable future. Siarlys Jenkins says: May 15, 2017 at 7:53 pm In an automated world with a guaranteed income, people who found it fulfilling would be free to write, and share their work for free or voluntary contributions, just as people who were utterly unmotivated would be free to be lotus eaters. The machines don’t have any more oprobrium about working hard all day so humans can relax and live on welfare. Pepi says: May 15, 2017 at 8:42 pm [Siarlys Jenkins says: May 15, 2017 at 7:53 pm In an automated world with a guaranteed income, people who found it fulfilling would be free to write, and share their work for free or voluntary contributions, just as people who were utterly unmotivated would be free to be lotus eaters.

Brendan from Oz says: May 15, 2017 at 8:53 pm Once the robots are the writers and musicians (already happening) then who cares? Who will read – other bots? In Australia, noise pollution laws (cue AC/DC Rock and Roll Ain’t Noise Pollution) and poker machines taking over the dance floors means that there are no venues for bands to play in and learn their craft. No revenue from touring, none from recording. Once Hatsune Miku is completely automated … I seem to recall “Little Heroes” by Norman Spinrad, but that seems quaint now. If the bots take over the creative fields as well as the grunt work, and don’t care about radiation or climate … the future is bots. Teach them religion and compassion, or at least allow for it in the code. Karl Keating says: May 15, 2017 at 9:18 pm “We all know the story of how the Internet has more or less destroyed newspapers and bookstores.”–RD 1. I live in a one-newspaper city, San Diego. The “San Diego Union Tribune”–to which I’ve subscribed for forty years–provides remarkably little true news. It takes me ten minutes to read the local news section. I get more local news from online sources. Ditto for state news. Ditto for national and foreign news. The biases of the “U-T” show through in its selection of articles (once a conservative paper, it’s been liberal for years). That means many important stories deliberately don’t get covered and many unimportant ones do, for ideological reasons. 2. Even before Amazon arrived, I seldom found books of interest at B. Dalton (RIP), BookStar (RIP), or Barnes & Noble (almost RIP). Their offerings of books on religion, for example, didn’t much extend beyond New Age crackpotism and the sentimentalistic stuff that appealed to certain Evangelical women. And politics or political philosophy? Forget it. I had to rely on printed catalogues from specialty publishers. 3. The Big 5 publishers, and lesser publishers on the next lower tier, effectively excluded countless well-written books from publication. Their business model (then and now) has been based on a few mega-sellers, not on a vast list of books that make a profit but not a large profit. To get published at all, many authors had to go to presses so obscure that, yes, their books would see print but almost no potential buyers would see their books. I don’t mourn the travails of the Big 5 or the demise of the big-box bookstores. (Small bookstores actually are growing in numbers.) Amazon, both as a retailer and a publishing platform, has more than compensated–and Amazon, though by far the largest, isn’t the only medium of its kind. BaronHarkonnen says: May 15, 2017 at 9:21 pm Piracy cannot be stopped but I have good news for you Mr D: You’ve already taken part in the evolution of your profession as you are now a writer who writes for a live audience. And then you take the sum of the thoughts you have written and condense them into one succinct book with a definite theme. Then you do speaking gigs about the book. Pretty cool! Andy Weir pulled the same trick, by accident, with his amazing novel “The Martian”, which was then turned into an excellent film. He posted some scenarios of a guy surviving on Mars for free on a blog, people got interested and urged him to condense it into a book! Book sold massively, and now he’s often involved with NASA events! Weir is an exception for fictional works though. I consume large amounts of sci-fi myself, which I pay for to read on my kindle, but I don’t like having the plot given away either. I purposefully avoid reading any reviews or details from books whose theme sound good. It’s never occurred to me however to stiff a writer for a book but that doesn’t help I’m sure. BaronHarkonnen says: May 15, 2017 at 9:23 pm Regarding chip embedded in the brain. That sounds terrifying doesn’t it. It’s revolting, it’d mean you’re no longer you! That’s how everyone reacts to the idea. But you have to understand what is meant by a chip in your brain. You have to understand what the brain actually is and how it works and how it has evolved over time. And one could argue that tech augmentation is the next step of that evolution. You wouldn’t suddenly be a robot, not any more than you are now when you interact with that magic device you have in your pocket right now. But instead of tapping and swiping on a screen, you’d think what you want. Same thing, easier interface. That simplification of artificial communication interfaces has been going on for decades. We made it possible to speak to someone without being in the same room with the telephone. We made it faster to send written communication with email rather than the post office. Yet we are still human! A chip in your brain means you can think… … Open sesame! for the IOT door. … Hrm I’ve never seen that kind of flower before. Transmit image from eyes, summon wikipedia! … Ring ring verizon brain interface hi honey I’m on my way home! … OMG that cat gif I just saw in what is literally my mind’s eye is hilarious! Anyway, it’s happening folks. You cannot stop it. Embrace, mould to your liking and to your ethics, but don’t throw your wooden shoes into the gears. Not gonna make a dent. Participate in how it’s made, the values behind it. Unless of course you want to become a massive terrorist organization hellbent on bringing us back to the year 1990. You know, like we already have a massive terrorist organization hellbent on bringing us back to the year 990 hah. We do prefer our millennium don’t we. But the next one will be amazing. We need to participate to make sure we don’t let it get out of hand because we don’t want to become the Borg… or end up in The Matrix or something. Which is inevitable as well. hah! Anyway if you have two or three hours to devote to something that will blow your mind and change your world view I highly recommend this: http://waitbutwhy.com/2017/04/neuralink.html Don’t let the funny style fool you into thinking it’s not serious. That just makes it more entertaining. But it’s heavy, heavy stuff and you’ll come away with a profound new understanding of the brain and tech’s inevitable merge. And if you like that, this one on Artificial Intelligence is a must as well: http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-1.html Mind-blowing, truly, which is not a phrase I use lightly. One more thing: the people working on this stuff aren’t kids running on pizza and pepsi. Those are the up and comers implementing features of this and that (impressive in itself.) But the ones doing the heavy lifting, research level stuff, are experienced PhDs with real lives and normal hours and families of their own and they deserve your respect as they are your overlords. Tag Murphy says: May 15, 2017 at 9:28 pm You write: “What is less well known to the general public is how it has destroyed the music business.” That’s the best news I’ve heard in quite a while! Destroy the “music business!” Will people start singing in choirs again, learn to play instruments, make their own music? That’s the only way we’ll ever get another Bach — by destroying the notion that music is a business. After we’ve destroyed the music business, maybe we can move on to destroy the painting business and the literature business and the education business and the friendship business — perhaps even the religion business? Who knows what might happen then? People might even have the ears to hear if an Isaiah or a Shakyamuni appeared among us again! Matthew Goddard says: May 15, 2017 at 9:29 pm Rod, thanks for this post. You’re touching on topics that I think are too rarely considered by those who care about culture. Healthy cultures have healthy cultural markets, but very few people want to think about the necessary conditions for healthy cultural markets. Most people can’t get beyond “free stuff = good”, let alone to the point of imagining what great goods (creative works, jobs, etc.) might arise from a healthy cultural market. (And that’s not even getting into the issues of privacy, data security, etc.) Those who want to get the history of how we got here should absolutely check out Robert Levine’s book “Free Ride”. To the fellow in the comments who said “there’s no solution to piracy”… it’s funny how, in certain circles, there’s a solution to absolutely everything except for what benefits those circles. Finally, an aside that’s neither here nor there… “Move fast and break things” could have been Martin Luther’s motto. Take it or leave it! WillW says: May 15, 2017 at 9:31 pm I’m gonna squeeze this in here, whether it’s an exact fit or not. You know the whole deal of “you can subscribe to your paper for what you spend on coffee.”? Ummm my local paper started charging .25 more and dropped an entire section, so I would’ve been spending more money for less paper, so no. That is not a sustainable business model. Gregory says: May 15, 2017 at 9:33 pm Interesting post, Mr. Dreher. I call it monopoly surveillance capitalism. What a great quotation. You're The Product (cheap, too) says: May 15, 2017 at 9:52 pm “Amazon demanded 70 percent of the subscription revenues, leaving him with 30 percent to cover the cost of creating 100 percent of the content. This, he noted, could hardly be characterized as a fair business deal.” No. The only way to sustain a business model like that is to move to DC and buy the local newspaper and lots of politicians. Which is what Bezos is doing. Surveillance capitalism is a loser for almost everybody except the owners and their foreign workers. Indeed, the data that the surveillance capitalists are stealing from us by spying and monitoring is toxic, and some fine day, those who own and operate surveillance capitalist businesses like Google, Facebook, and Amazon will be treated like the owners of the old industrial companies that dumped mercury, carcinogens, and other deadly filth in the water and ground. Giuseppe Scalas says: May 15, 2017 at 9:53 pm A few remarks. Culture is an elite thing. It’s true nowadays as ever. The reason for this is culture is not the heaping of notions, but the ability to be part of the millennia-long conversation of humanity. Such an ability can be acquired only through a long training. Folk culture is suffering both from the demise of a local elite which used to intermediate high culture so that it could enrich popular forms of art, and from the demise of community – which intermediated the cultural history, forms and tastes which allowed folk popular culture to develop. Internet cannot replace community because its typical model of aggregation is the swarm, not the community. The cultural agencies of today aren’t able to replace those two factors: elite culture and community, for the mere reason they don’t care about the contents they convey. That’s why we see mass culture falling back to the lowest common denominator. Elites will likely regroup around different cultural agencies than social medias. TAC is probably an example. I’m neither on facebook or on twitter. I experienced facebook through my wife’s account, and I found it extraordinarily dull. Those who are not satisfied by the dullness of mass social media will turn to – and pay for – places such as TAC. Those cultural agencies will prosper because their curators actually care about the cultural contents they mediate and preserve the human touch which cannot be replicated by the machine-run medias: maybe they will be able simulate humans, but there won’t be no Rod Dreher to write to or to meet at the Walker Percy weekend. Regarding technology, I’m convinced that we’ll go through a revolutionary moment because the social arrangement which is being outlined by the impending technology developments (AI + robotics) is not going to be socially sustainable. It’s not the working class that will start it, though. It will rather be the making of the dispossessed intellectuals, professionals and white collars, and the working class will make, as always, the mass of maneuver. Such a revolution will take the shape of a cyberwar, where physical violence and cybernetic warfare will be equally important. However, the determining factor, as in every revolution, will be the ability of one party to physically defeat its enemy. Brendan from Oz says: May 15, 2017 at 10:16 pm Working in the IT industry and knowing how often chips and software fails, having a Blue Screen of Death in your skull is not a feature – it’s the biggest bug of all. Hacking your chip/brain? Have you seen how easy stuff is to hack since everything is done on the cheap, especially R&D on new tech? We have bugs on the Net that have been around for years bevcause of the cost-cutting to R&D – realease for profit now! The coders might not be on pizza and pepsi, but the bean-counters don’t write code and inist upon minimal testing and development to save $$$. Tech isn’t perfect, or magic, let alone divine. It’s stuff designed on the fly/cheap to be able to be hacked to make money for a few. Do yoiu really want to wait for next months patches so your brain is secure from the latest hack? Like the music biz. I wonder if bots can be sued for cultural appropriation and the like. At present, most pop music is written by old white guys for pre-fab stars, whoever is performing and whatever race they are. Classical music is also being written by bots. From https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/10/hit-charade/403192/ “Millions of Swifties and KatyCats—as well as Beliebers, Barbz, and Selenators, and the Rihanna Navy—would be stunned by the revelation that a handful of people, a crazily high percentage of them middle-aged Scandinavian men, write most of America’s pop hits. It is an open yet closely guarded secret, protected jealously by the labels and the performers themselves, whose identities are as carefully constructed as their songs and dances. The illusion of creative control is maintained by the fig leaf of a songwriting credit. The performer’s name will often appear in the list of songwriters, even if his or her contribution is negligible. (There’s a saying for this in the music industry: “Change a word, get a third.”) But almost no pop celebrities write their own hits. Too much is on the line for that, and being a global celebrity is a full-time job.” lancelot lamar says: May 15, 2017 at 10:24 pm One thing I never hear in these discussions, and that your interview with the author didn’t mention, is simply the need for copyright reform, along with much stronger copyright enforcement. People feel little or no guilt at violating copyrights because now the copyright holders, through their buying and bullying influence in Congress, have essentially made copyrights eternal. If copyrights lasted only a generation, 20-30 years, and then all that material came into the public domain as it should, then strict enforcement of copyrights would make sense, and–perhaps more importantly–people would see the fairness in respecting copyrights for the generation they were in force. What if everything copyrighted before 1997 or even 1987–all movies, books, articles, music, recordings, TV shows, software–was in the public domain, and then next year everything from 1998 or 1988 joined that? Everything free online. What a boon to culture and creativity, and what an incentive for creative artists and corporations to continue to innovate and create. And the huge amount of stuff in the public domain would be an incentive for people to respect the copyrights of more recent creations. People see Mickey Mouse still under copyright, and laugh, seeing Disney and other corporate giants profiting for 100 years or more off of the creative genius of men and women dead for nearly as long. People of my generation also remember the music industry keeping CD prices at 15 to 20 dollars (45-60 in today’s dollars) for as long as they could, just gouging everyone for something that cost them about a dollar to produce. I remember reading once how fabulously rich the grandson of C.S. Lewis was (not really his grandson, but the son of the son of Lewis’ late in life wife, whom she had by another man) off of Lewis’ copyrights. Authors, musicians and filmmakers (and inventors for that matter, patent law needs to be reformed in the same way) should be able to live fairly off of their work for a generation, but their grandchildren and great-grandchildren should not. Without copyright reform, copyright holders won’t be able to have their copyright enforcement, and rightly so. Seven sleepers says: May 15, 2017 at 10:35 pm I work for one of these companies. Really, I say, it’s quite insane what is being planned and talked about plainly as if it were a matter of decision between tea or coffee. As an influential peer has said, “we need to be on the good side of cool, and not on the overwhelming but probably mor fitting side of creepy”. It’s like, the conversation *begins* at what kind of servitude to the overlord intelligence will be like, and goes from there. I shyte u naught. Giuseppe Scalas says: May 15, 2017 at 10:46 pm A translation of a recent interview of the philosopher Emanuele Severino to “Corriere della Sera”. A hypothetical and scary World War III will be a “rear guard” war with respect to the “primary conflict” already in place: the one between the forces that make use of Technics – Capitalism, Democracy, Religions, Communism, Nationalisms – and Technics itself. The traditional forces are convinced they are leading the game but they are already at its margins. In order to prevail one over each other, they have to potentiate their technical means. But doing so they forsake their original goal, e.g., increasing profits for Capitalism, doing Allah’s will for Islam. They become something different. In the purest Severinian language “they are destined to fade”. A “destination” whose authentic meaning escapes to contemporary culture, both scientific and humanist. Not to philosophy. The victory, then, goes to Technics, the “poisoned gift” of the West, the “project of world transformation” carried out, after God’s death has been proclaimed – by the technical and scientific system, by the rational, physical, mathematical thought which is destined to become stronger than the systems which are using it today. And what about Man? Man it’s just a mean to increase the power of Technics, not its end. “the humanity of Technics is the death of man”. […] Professor Severino, is World War III possible? And why to ask this question to Philosophy? “There’s this possibility in the scientific field too, just think about George Friedman’s predictions. The attritions between Russia and the United States and the recent cyberwar tests remind us as much. However, political science, geopolitics, sociology and psychology don’t sufficiently consider the implications between Technics as driven by modern science and the forces that want to exploit Technics to achieve their goals. They don’t consider, above all, this basic principle: that the goal of a more or less complex action determines its configuration and structure. The forces exploiting Technics are highly complex actions and, precisely because they make use of Technics, they are destined to take on a different goal than their own: they are destined to fade and Technics is destined to rule over them. The result is surprising: the conflict between such forces becomes a rear-guard war, and obsolete one with respect to the main conflict between their ensemble and Technique itself. Our contemporary culture, both scientific and humanist, can’t grasp the true meaning of such destiny. Technics is destined to rule because the essential underground of the Philosophy of the last two centuries shows that the only possible truth is that everything changes, and this sweeps away any other truth and, above all, the truth of the Western tradition, which limits the technical action. […] What happens to Man in this process of self-affirming of Technics? “The goal of the worldwide technical-scientific system is not the Christian, Capitalist, Communist or Democratic well-being of humanity, but the unlimited increase of power and the conflict between the forces now at war among themselves restrains such increment. The enrichment of weapon merchant does not increment the power of the technical-scientific system, only their capital. Therefore, the system increases its power by reducing and eventually eliminating such conflict. The goal of the system – that is, of the supreme for of the will to power – is not “Man”. “Man” is the means to increase its power. Although “Man” is not the goal of Capitalism, Capitalism produces a higher level of well-being than Socialism, which has “Man” as an explicit goal. The same happens with Technics, which hasn’t “Man” as a goal in a quite more radical way than Capitalism. Pax technica: is this the final destination, the end of every conflict? “Before it can prevail, the worldwide technical system must react against the attempts of traditional force to resist. This reaction is an episode – possibly one of the last ones – of the rear-guard wars. World War III cannot be one of those episodes. To be a “World” War it has to be a war between the powers that can determine the atomic destruction of the Planet – that is, the USA and Russia. In those Countries the process according to which Technics takes more and more as its goal the increase of its own power is the most advanced. Therefore, those same places won’t be blind to the fact that their true goals are actually identical (that is, the increase of the power of Technics) and that the reasons of their conflict is unreal. This, not only makes a World War III impossible, but makes the triumph of Technical “universalism” unavoidable. This doesn’t mean that the pax technica is the end of all conflicts, but it determines a change of the configuration of the enemy and of the war. The new enemies will be the historical forms which will bring the world beyond the era of the ruling of Technics – as this ruling won’t be the last word. Actually, the beginning of the last word, which is an infinite one, starts from there.” Greg Webb says: May 15, 2017 at 10:50 pm Property rights were developed to assign scarce resources to owners who we recognize have rights, instead of all of us just fighting for stuff. I know it’s a hard paradigm to imagine but things like ideas or the order or words or a piece of music are not scarce: the can be replicated infinitely. Musicians make money primarily from live gigs now and that’s ok. I admit, it’s harder to see how an author would make a living (I’m guessing things like speaking fees), but what they create is not necessarily their property IMO. Think of how valuable the formula E=MC^2 is but Einstein didn’t copyright it to make his money. I don’t have the answers and am sensitive to the fairness argument but the fact that almost everyone in the world has no problem listening to music for free shows that can’t think it’s THAT unfair – right?

The new system embeds Google Assistant in cars for the first time.  (Matt Rourke / The Associated Press)   By Mark Gurman Mark BergenBloomberg Mon., May 15, 2017 Android already powers most smartphones on earth. Now Google is placing its mobile operating system right inside cars, a bid to cement its core service in the auto industry as more technology sweeps in.  On Monday, ahead of its I/O mobile developers’ conference, Alphabet Inc.’s Google is showing off its next step in automotive software: an Android version of touchscreen car consoles and infotainment systems. It will host popular applications, such as Google Maps and Spotify, but also control car features such as seat positioning and temperature. The new system also embeds the Google Assistant — the company’s voice control service, for searching on the go, asking for directions and making phone calls — in cars for the first time.  Read more: How Google took over U.S. classrooms Article Continued Below Google’s parent eyes Toronto as location of new high-tech district: sources Google, Amazon flex digital dominance with first-quarter results At I/O, Google will show off live demonstrations of the operating system running on the Audi Q8 and Volvo V90 SUVs. Patrick Brady, a vice president of engineering for Android, said the system will make its way to Audi and Volvo’s entire fleets, along with other manufacturers. Google showed a concept of the software running on a Chrysler vehicle earlier this year. Alphabet shares rose less than one per cent to $958.50 at 9:56 a.m. in New York.  This isn’t Google’s first stab at software for cars. In 2014, the tech giant introduced Android Auto, a system that lets people project content from their Android smartphones to their car’s screen. Brady said Android Auto now runs on 300 car models.  The new system plunges deeper, taking over the underlying software on the car. A driver doesn’t need to plug in an Android phone to run it. It also adds some features, such as 3D mapping and satellite images, that Android Auto lacks. Brady said this fusion of apps and controls inside a car is necessary. “Where cars are going, everything is integrated into one display,” he said. “We think the future is a much more seamless, integrated system.” Other software companies have pitched a similar system. BlackBerry’s QNX division powers the systems inside of more than 50 million cars currently on the road, including models from Ford Motor Co. and Daimler AG’s Mercedes-Benz. Samsung spent $8 billion for Harman International Inc., a leading supplier of in-car entertainment services. And some car companies, such as Toyota, have invested in their own features, highlighting manufacturer’s concerns with ceding a critical consumer experience to tech companies.  Apple, which currently offers the CarPlay product that’s similar in practice to Android Auto, is also working on its own car operating system to power its self-driving software, Bloomberg has reported. Brady said that Apple’s CarPlay could run on top of cars with the embedded Android system. While Google isn’t getting a sales cut from its new system, the company has an interest in keeping Apple and Amazon, which has reached agreements with carmakers for its own digital assistant, from capturing the vehicle software market. Brady said Google was not taking any critical vehicle tracking information with the new system.  Bloomberg received a preview of an Android-based infotainment system running on a Volvo. This version of the software had three main windows for users: a central panel for playing music, making calls and navigating; another with a grid of core car functions; and a third that lists installed Android apps. A button on the steering wheel and a voice command can activate the Google Assistant. Google wouldn’t say when the first models will hit the streets. And it’s operating system didn’t look completely finished. For example, a drop-down menu for quickly accessing settings was not yet active in a demonstration.  Each Android software car partner will have the ability to customize the controls, interface, and applications pre-loaded into the operating system, the company said. For now, Brady said Google is not pre-installing a slate of its own apps, as it does with Android phones. Android for the car might eventually extend to dashboard items like speedometers and back seat screens. Yet Google executives said the software will not reach to instruments critical to car safety — it’s keeping YouTube off the screen, for instance, given the risk to distracting drivers. The new car feature also hints at Google’s long-term ambitions to spread its artificial intelligence service to every corner of consumer’s lives. For example, a user in a compatible car could ask the Assistant to turn on the lights at home before arriving, Brady said. That assumes car owners have compatible smart home hardware. Google said it’s working on bringing the voice assistant to Android Auto. Apple’s CarPlay system is already compatible with its voice assistant Siri for sending text messages and navigation, but unlike Android’s new system, Apple’s cannot control car functions like temperature.  Read more about: Google Delivered dailyThe Morning Headlines Newsletter Subscribe The Toronto Star and thestar.com, each property of Toronto Star Newspapers Limited, One Yonge Street, 4th Floor, Toronto, ON, M5E 1E6.

According to Android Police, the tech giant is said to have almost completed plans to launch Google Assistant to iOS users in the US. Citing reliable sources familiar with the matter, the Mountain View, California-based tech giant will be announced soon as a standalone app. The source further adds that the announcement will be made at Google’s I/O conference this week. Though, the company’s plans are still unclear at the moment, launching an iOS version of the famous assistant will further give the app a big push in the AI market. The new standalone app will work the same way it is being used by Google Allo users on Android. It would feature a blend of the “chat” style functionality Android users are already used to, and will also be built with similar voice-controlled version on Android. Google Assistant or Artificial Assistant or AI, enables you to get help without leaving the conversation. The feature can suggest a nearby restaurant or “movies to check out” as Google puts it. The idea behind adding this feature is to help you get answers even without leaving the app. You can get different answers, including directions just by adding @google. Google Assistant is powered by “machine learning and deep-learning-based language processing.” It means that it can talk smart and it is more like a person that you are talking to than just a flat, companion without brains or emotions. The technology allows the Assistant to understand context. Because of that, it paves the way for a two-way conversation interaction between the user and the handset Want to know what’s happening with your favorite team or find out the latest score? Get the power of Google Assistant to help you sort that out by chatting one-on-one. This feature brings the power of machine learning to bear on the chat app. What you share with the Assistant is up to you, “and the more you use it, the more useful it gets.” Google had earlier in February announced that that its Assistant will be available to non-Pixel smartphones. Before this, it was only accessible on non-Pixel phones through Allo, which is Google’s messaging app. Furthermore, only a pair of Pixel handsets integrated Assistant natively. Google announced its intention of adding the Assistant to phones in October 2016 when it rolled out two pixel smartphones. From Google’s perspective, the future is definitely all about AI. The two Pixel smartphones launched last year by the company were the first set of phones with built-in Google Assistant. Last January, Google announced that its Assistant will be added to TVs, Android smartwatches and cars. According to Google, the Assistant will support TVs and set-top boxes powered by Android TV. It means you will be able to ask the Google Assistant for help—and this means you will be able to access your favorite content faster than ever, and on the best screen in your house.  All you have to do is ask the Google Assistant and forget about typing.

We've written on the topic ourselves in the past. Google has a new project in the works to improve the situation, though. Meet Project Treble. Typical lifecycle of an Android release Currently, Android software updates need to go through three major roadblocks: chipset makers must create new drivers and software packages, device manufacturers must use those drivers in their software packages, and carriers must then add their customizations and release the update (save for carrier-unlocked devices). Project Treble wants to help sort out at least one of those problems. At its core, Project Treble seeks to place a standardized interface between device-specific low-level software (like the kernel and drivers) and the Android OS framework. Google says that Treble will try and create a division between the Android framework and device vendors' software, in much the same way that Android itself is split between system software and third-party apps. What this might mean to end users is that updating the Android operating system won't depend on chipset vendors to issue new device-specific software. Instead, Google can ship a new Android version, and device manufacturers can start working on an update right away and send it—salted to taste—to the carriers. Another potential upshot with Treble is that older devices can be supported for longer. Google says it's working with chipset makers to ensure that the new standardized vendor implementation will continue to be compatible with future Android versions. As an example, Qualcomm typically stops providing new chipset device drivers after two years, leaving OEMs out in the cold. Under the new model, a phone could continue to get system updates long after Qualcomm discontinues its chipset. Although Project Treble looks like it'll have a positive impact on the Android update situation, it's not all roses. Device manufacturers still need to care about issuing the updates, and it's still up to the carriers to push them out. Furthermore, Project Treble is only going to be available for devices that ship with the upcoming Android O. Seeing as many devices on sale now are still stuck with Android 6.0 (Marshmallow), the road ahead looks to be steep.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Google app’s image search shows new Clip Art, GIF, and color filters By Rei Padla - May 15, 2017 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter It was only last week when we noted the recent change on Google Search and now we’ve got information about another version that brings a number of changes like new doodles for an in-app experience, web pages opening directly right inside the app, offline voice activations, and an enhanced look and feel of the search area. The voice actions that turn on WiFi, play music, and turn on flashlight are said to be available in the United States only, at least maybe for now. This particular update also brings a major change when searching for Google images. You can now search images with a specific color or type. You can filter images according to the latest posts, color, or whether it is a GIF or clip art that you want. When you get the latest Google app version, start searching for an image and you will see the filters. This is a pretty neat improvement because people have been looking for ways on how to make searching for images on Google faster and more convenient. Previously, we could already search using the Tools available–Size, Color, Type, Time, or Usage Rights among others. The Google app enhancement shows search results faster with just one click. No need for deep links on Google Search because the app will easily show the filters and colors you may need and eventually choose.

Scroll down for video  The search giant is set to unveil an iOS app version of its popular Google assistant later this week at its I/O developer conference. The same software powers its Home speaker (pictured) Android Police says 'according to a trusted source, Google plans to announce that the Google Assistant will be launching on iOS soon as a standalone app.  'The announcement could come as soon as Google's I/O conference this week, but it's unclear exactly what Google's plans are at this time.' It is believed the app will combine 'chat' style functionality in the Google Allo version of Assistant and the voice-controlled version found on Android.  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Uber's self driving car setback as Judge bans executive...

Share this article Share At the unveiling of its Home speaker in May, Google boss Sundar Pichai said:  'We think of the assistant as an ambient experience that goes across devices - this is more than just phones, it will be on devices they wear, in their car and in their living rooms.' The leading tech companies are all competing to assist consumers in their online activities such as shopping, since that gives the companies a better chance of selling advertising or other services. Home-based systems like the Echo are taking on more importance with the advent of improved voice technology, according to Julie Ask, an analyst at Forrester Research. It comes as Apple is set to release a smart Siri speaker alongside a 10.5-inch iPad Pro at its highly anticipated World Developers Conference in June. The device is expected to resemble the 9.7-in model, but will boast a larger screen on the same chassis size with narrower bezels, and comes amid falling global tablet sales.   BATTLE OF THE HOME AI  Google's $130 (£105) Home speaker is triggered by the phrase 'Hey Google' while Amazon's Echo uses 'Alexa'. Amazon's smart speaker is available in two versions - the full sized $180 (£145) Echo shown here, and a smaller, $50 (£40) version called the Echo Dot. Amazon Echo relies on Microsoft's Bing search engine and Wikipedia, while Google Home uses the company's own Google Search. Both Home and Echo are continually listening for commands, though Google and Amazon say nothing gets passed back to them until the speakers hear a keyword — 'OK, Google' for Home and 'Alexa' for Echo. Google's Assistant software is also able to answer follow-up questions on the same topic, in a near-conversation style, but Echo as yet cannot. However, Amazon's Alexa software has a wider range of skills on offer that enable it to link up with and control more third-party devices around the home. A light comes on to remind you that it's listening. You can turn off the microphone temporarily, too.  Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference is set to kick off on June 5 and last until June 9, which the firm uses to showcase new software and technologies for developers. And Apple usually has a few surprises in stored for attendees and viewers. KGI analyst Ming-Chi Kuo shared the last predictions with 9to5Mac, in which he said there is more than 50 percent chance the smart speaker will be unveiled at the conference and more than 70 percent chance the new 10.5-inch iPad Pro will also make an appearance. Apple is set to release a 10.5-inch iPad Pro (stock) at its highly anticipated World Developers Conference in June. The device is expected to resemble the 9.7-in model, but will boast a larger screen on the same chassis size with narrower bezels Kuo described the iPad as 'an all-new design', as it will have the same chassis size as the 9.7-inch model, but will boast a larger screen. It is believed that the device will mirror the design of Apple's upcoming iPhone 8. And Kuo speculates that Apple will ship about six million 10.5-inch iPad Pros this year. But what has many iOS fans sitting on the edge of the seats is the possibility of a Siri Speaker. Rumors regarding the a smart speaker hit the web in September 2016, when news spread that the device had left the research and development lab and was being tested as a prototype. Although this technology would put the iPhone maker in the same game as Amazon and Google, who is developing Google Home, Apple envisions it a little different - it would augment its smartphones. APPLE'S SIRI-DRIVEN SMART SPEAKER Sonny Dickson, who is known for sharing inside information in the tech world, revealed that Apple is 'currently finalizing' its smart speaker that will be marketed as a 'Siri/AirPlay device'. Adding Airplay support to the device would let users push music, radio, and podcasts to the Apple hardware over Wi-Fi, which typically offers better quality than Bluetooth.   Rumors regarding the a smart speaker hit the web in September 2016, when news spread that the device had left the research and development lab and was being tested as a prototype He also revealed details that it could 'carry some form of Beats technology and is expected to run on variant iOS'. Dickson also told Mashable that it would have a 'concave top' with the controls, 'Mac Pro style.' KGI analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has also revealed that the device will have a 'touch panel', but it is not clear whether this means it will boast capacitive buttons or the design of Amazon's new Echo Show. Apple is attempting to differentiate itself from the other firms with more advanced microphone and speaker technology, two people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg in September. And some of the technology in the prototype includes facial recognition sensors, another said.  The public did not hear about the device again until April when Sonny Dickson, a well-known tech leaker, revealed that the Cupertino company was 'currently finalizing' its smart speaker and noted that it will be marketed as a 'Siri/AirPlay device'.

Dickson told Mashable that it would have a 'concave top' with the controls, 'Mac Pro style.' And earlier this month, Kuo said that the Apple will unveil the Siri speaker at WWDC. The product is believed to be aimed at bringing Appl'e AI into the home, and will have a higher price tag that the Amazon range, which begins at $49 for the Echo Dot.  Kuo has also noted that the device will have a 'touch panel', but it is not clear whether this means it will boast capacitive buttons or the design of Amazon's new Echo Show.     Read more: KGI: Apple likely to launch 10.5-inch iPad Pro and Siri Speaker at WWDC alongside new software | 9to5Mac Apple News on iPhone, iPad and Macbooks | Daily Mail Online Google will announce Assistant for iOS soon, in the US only at launch Share or comment on this article e-mail 10 shares Most watched News videos Bizarre footage of tattooed King of Thailand wearing a CROP TOP The Day the Dinosaurs Died: BBC releases trailer for new dino show Video of what appears to be Jayson lying handcuffed on the ground Shocking moment a child on a scooter collides with a moving car Watch the trailer for Shut-Ins: Britain's Fattest Woman Theresa May praises NHS staff in wake of cyber attack Adorable moment baby waits for beat to drop so she can dance The moment a bully picks the wrong fight and gets body slammed Police say they've commenced a garage search for Danielle Jones Video purports to show North Korea firing another ballistic missile Theresa May confronted on campaign trail by angry voter Government urged to clarify if cyber attack was preventable Homeland Security adviser warns about 'WannaCry' cyber...

MailOnline puts Sony's XB40 to the test Sony SRS-XB40 has a built-in multi-coloured line light, speaker lights and a flashing strobe. It features 24 hours of battery life and claims to be a 'mini-disco on the move'. But does it live up to the claim? Samsung's Galaxy S8: A hefty price tag and a dumb personal assistant Samsung's new Galaxy S8 phone is stunning, but its $100 price hike is hard to swallow. Overall the S8 is for those who want elegance - and are willing to pay for it. Affordable, robust and surprisingly responsive: Samsung's Galaxy A5 With the eagerly awaited Galaxy S8 having been pushed back, South Korea-based Samsung has plugged the gap with the Samsung Galaxy A5, a high-end device with a mid-range price tag. Is it really worth paying £280 for Nintendo's Switch? MailOnline's verdict While the design is impressive and easy to use, the game line up is disappointing. Google's Daydream: The $79 headset that could bring VR to the masses Google's $79 headset is superb in terms of hardware - but is currently let down by a lack of apps. However, it has absolutely huge potential to finally bring VR to the masses. Welcome Home: Google's $130 smart speaker Google's smart Home speaker still has a lot of learning to do, and loses out to Amazon's Echo in some areas - but has incredible potential 'Not quite an iPhone replacement': Google's Pixel phone Google's Pixel handset is good, and boasts an amazing camera and smart assistant. It's the king of the Android handsets - but still not great. Xbox One S review: Console that will make your 4K TV shine Microsoft's Xbox One S has shrunk the giant console by 40%, and is stunningly designed console with 4K HDR capabilities - but comes with some caveats. The $1,000 wireless speaker that really IS worth the price: Naim Mu-so Qb review Naim's incredible Mu-So Qb takes you back to the good old days - where the music captivates and enthralls, rather that simply being something in the background. The hi-tech $2,000 spin bike that really could change your life Peloton's hi-tech bike lets you stream live and on demand rides to your home - and it's one of the best examples of fitness technology out there - at a price. Apple's new 9.7inch iPad Pro is a powerhouse you can take anywhere Apple has added a few improvements to the smaller version, creating a tablet that is astonishingly powerful, but, unlike its big brother, is something you'll be able to carry everywhere. Speaker that looks as good as its sounds: B&W Zeppelin Wireless review It's not cheap, but the $699 (£500) Zeppelin Wireless is perfect for the design conscious music fan. The best all in one wireless speaker you'll ever hear: Naim Mu-so review It might not be a name familiar to the US market, but Naim is a legendary British brand hoping to make a splash with the American launch of its $1499 Mu:So speaker.

These technologies will play an important part in digital transformation efforts of many organizations. By Michael Krigsman for Beyond IT Failure | May 15, 2017 -- 19:37 GMT (12:37 PDT) | Topic: CXO We hear terms like virtual reality and augmented reality without always understanding what they mean and the implications for business. Beyond cute stickers in Snapchat or Pokemon Go, augmented reality is going to have a profound impact on many parts of our lives including social relationships, professional activities, and culture. In the coming years, domains as diverse as medicine, training and education, customer and field service, and transportation - to name but a few - will change as the technology companies, telecom suppliers, and governments build the infrastructure needed to support wide-scale adoption of augmented reality. I believe there is no question that innovator technology organizations in the enterprise must start learning about augmented reality. Whether you sell to consumers or B2B, now is the time to plan your augmented reality strategy. Focus first on the business strategy. Although augmented reality requires a significant technology infrastructure, the business case must drive how you deploy the technology. For example, if your company provides field service, the first step is figuring out how augmented reality can help your organization better serve its customers. If you run a hotel or resort, begin with the question, "How can augmented reality improve the guest experience?". As with any form of digital transformation, success with augmented reality demands collaboration across the entire organization. The CIO will probably build out the infrastructure; marketing and product development will formulate product offerings; customer service will determine how to incorporate augmented reality in post-sales support. And the CEO will ultimately be responsible for examining the business model implications. In summary, augmented reality represents a frontier of innovation that will happen; it's only a matter of time. To explore this topic, I invited two of the world's most prominent experts to participate on Episode 228 of the CXOTALK series of conversations with innovators. Robert Scoble and Shel Israel are well-known technology authors, researchers, and consultants. Their latest book, The Fourth Transformation, explores the implications of these technologies for both consumers and the enterprise. Watch the video embedded above and read a complete transcript at the CXOTALK site. As always, you can download the podcast on iTunes. Here is an excerpt from the video with an edited transcript: What's the difference between AR, VR, and mixed reality? Robert Scoble: So VR, first of all, you're in a black box and you're only seeing virtual things. You're not seeing the real world at all. With AR, or augmented reality, you can today use your phone like on Snapchat or on Facebook and aim it at things, and see virtual things on top of the world. Soon, you're going to be wearing glasses, and soon, being in the next three to four years, you're going to see a range of glasses from companies like Apple, Facebook, Snap... There are ten under development that Shel and I know about, and we probably don't know about all of them. That will lock the virtual image to the real world, and let you walk around it. And, that can interact, and that's really mind-blowing. I mean, with the HoloLens, you can have aliens coming out of your walls, and they're putting holes in your real wall. You're seeing the real wall, but it looks like there's an alien coming through it. And it's like, mind-blowing what this technology does for education, for retail, for all sorts of things. Your book is called "The Fourth Transformation." Give us an overview. Shel Israel: In the First Transformation, we started with putting words into PCs, on knowledge worker desktops, in the form of personal computers. Then, we went to point-and-click with the McIntosh, and that meant everyone could use these desktop things. Then, we went to touch and mobility, and that brought us into what is now this third transformation where anyone is using digital technology everywhere. Now, we're going to go to a system which is much more intimate than what we have with phones. We're going to have things in a few years that look like glasses I'm wearing. And, they are going to allow us to do all the things that I had just named: MR, AR, VR; and we're not going to look freakish, and we're not going to be tethered to anything. This means that the customer experience in stores is going to change because they can do things in 3D. They will walk into stores, be at home, and have an immersive experience with the product. This means that surgeons can get assistance while wearing headsets. It means that anatomy students will be doing virtual surgeries in headsets, rather than with frozen cadavers. Every single place we look will be virtual teachers in China, at least; students will learn what looks like what the Civil War was like not be memorizing the name of a battle and by dates, but by actually getting to Gettysburg and getting the full impact of what a bloody war is like. Wherever you look, whatever you do, it's going to be enhanced with mixed reality technologies. What kind of investment is needed to make this vision to fruition? Robert Scoble: Sensors that are seen around the world that is billions of dollars for R&D. IM-Sense was bought by Apple. Google Tango is doing the same kinds of research; Meta is doing the same kind of ... Everybody who wants to build a mixed reality glass has to build sensors to see the world in 3D and bring it into the glass. Then, you talk about the connectivity that you're going to need, right? Because with mixed reality glasses, you get as many TV screens around you as you want. So, imagine being able to watch CNN here; here, ESPN is playing; and over here, you can watch your security cameras from your business; and over here, you can watch Amazon servers; and over here, you can watch Facebook. You just look around, you have dozens of screens all around you, and you don't have to buy more if you want more screens. But, to serve all those screens with hi-res 4K or 8K video, or eventually even more in the future, you're going to need a lot of bandwidth, and that's 5G. 5G brings 35 gigabits per seconds down to the glasses, but we don't yet have 5G yet. Verizon has to re-do the architecture on a city because the cell tower needs to be a kilometer and a half from you or closer, and that's not true with today's cell technology. You can be 15 kilometers away. So, they need to put a lot more cell towers into a city, and they put fiber into each one of those antennas, so it's going to bring us 5G. That's coming this year. Verizon is turning on the first 11 cities this year. You go through the GPU; the GPU is needed to display the polygons. So, when you see virtual things in VR or AR, you're seeing millions of little polygons or little triangles that are underneath what you're seeing; and you'll need a better GPU to process more of those. So, if you want to increase the resolution or increase the frame rates, or increase the experience of being immersed in the media, you need more GPU; or, you need to do a lot of trickery with [...] rendering. And you look at the R&D budgets of NVidia, and AMD, Qualcomm, and other companies that are building these chips; they are spending billions of dollars per quarter in R&D. Then you keep looking around; companies are building eye sensors. GoogleBot, Eyefluence that's in our book, Facebook product company called Eye Tribe; there is lots of money spent on that, and particularly in the new user interfaces that you're experiencing when you get a glass like this. They're investing that. You just keep moving down the stack. The whole thing is expensive, and there are ten companies building these glasses, and they're all building their own infrastructure. And the infrastructure; Apple's building a CDN, so think about putting a server near you, so you have low-latency VR; you can play football with your friends over the internet. That requires a CDN that's a massive new expenditure for Apple and other companies. Let's talk about one that you're going to hear a lot more about: Facebook was the first one to use this term on stage in a big way; in a big, company way. And that's "SLAM." Simultaneous Location And Mapping; which means we're building a 3D map of the world, and it's not a map like Google Maps, where there is just a line in the middle of the street, but it's capturing the entire street in 3D. And, we're not just going to capture the street, we're going to capture every surface in the world with these glasses, and build a massive database. How big is that database going to be? Petabytes or Exabytes? How massive [an] amount of server space just to keep a 3D copy of the world at some resolution? You know, let's say a millimeter per pixel or voxel resolution around you? That's a huge amount of data, and that's a billion dollars right there just in a data center to start with. It might be three or four billion, once you are done, and certainly, you are going to have to change those machines out like you do with cloud computing machines at Amazon, for instance. And so, that's, right there, that's a billion dollars, minimum. And, Uber's building one of those copies, Mercedes is building one of those copies, Google already built one of those copies, Apple's building one of those copies, Facebook is working on this, right? That's what they were showing off when they said, "Oh, you can lock virtual things onto your tabletop. That's using SLAM; the phone instantly builds a point-cloud and then a 3D model of the world, and then starts doing AI to figure out how to lock things properly to the surfaces in your room. And that's going to be something that over the next 18 months, you're going to see a lot more of; because right now, we haven't seen any of the really good AI that recognizes the objects in your room, but that's coming, and that's coming big time according to Google because they're going to use the data that they built off the self-driving cars to bring to our glasses. And how many objects in the street does the Google self-driving car or now Waymo, recognize the hundreds of thousands of things, right? Because it needs to see a stop sign or a stop light and know what to do! And, the glasses are going to do the same thing. When you walk around, it's going to tell you stuff about the world that you're looking at. What's the time frame for all this to happen? Robert Scoble: It's now! This week, Facebook and Snap laid out expansive strategies for this. And if you're not paying attention to that, you're going to get slammed every month because, over the next 24 months, you're going to see ten glasses come out; and big companies come out with major new strategies around this. Apple is the one that I'm looking at the most, and Tim Cook has been out there talking about AR for a year now. Now, we have a question. Does he ship this year, does he ship next year, does he ship in 2019, but certainly by 2019, everybody is in the game! If you're running a business, you have to start thinking about how your customers in three years are going to experience your business as they walk in, or as they call you from this mixed reality world and what their experience expectation is going to be. How can brands today prepare for this inevitable future? Robert Scoble: You need to start getting into VR or getting a HoloLens and start thinking through strategically how your business is going to be changed by these technologies. Sephora, for instance, already is doing augmented reality signs in the stores, and they're already building augmented reality into their Apple app to augment makeup onto your face so that you could try out pink lipstick, for instance, on the Sephora app on the iPhone or Android. And they're already playing with this. So when the glasses come along, they're already going to have their engineering teams geared up, and they're already going to have a good idea of how they're going to build things, and they're going to be able to build it iteratively and nicely. And now, a Unity developer is fairly cheap, and in a year, a Unity developer is going to cost three times more than it does today. So, if you convince a Unity developer to come and join your team today, you're going to get them cheaper than you will in a year because Apple and Facebook and Google and Snap are going to wake everybody up. If that's the lesson this week, companies need to wake up to the fact that this stuff is becoming real, and fast. And you need to get into it. One deep change, your brand is going to be sprayed onto the world. You're going to walk into a hotel in five years, and the hotel is going to be augmented. Disneyland is going to be augmented. They're already working on it. So, their customers are going to walk in with Apple, or Facebook, or Google Glasses, or Snap Glasses, and things are going to be augmented in the park when you walk around. So, you are going to have to build a new kind of team that hasn't existed, and is a cultural review team, because you're going to make mistakes in this new world that are cultural. You might piss off Trump supporters, for instance; well, that's a lot of people to piss off. So, you've got to run a diverse team of people through your software the same way you run a diverse group of people through, to make sure you don't have bugs and crashes; to make sure you don't make cultural mistakes; make sure there are no Nazi symbols on the walls anywhere ... That's not through the design process. This stuff happens, but you need to have a team to work on this. Shel Israel: This is where the humans meet the sensors. This is all this Internet of Things; it has no value unless we interact with it and that's how we're going to be doing it. In every aspect of learning. [For example] virtual teachers in China. They can't produce teachers fast enough to keep up with students. So now, they're experimenting with a game company in a classroom where kids wear glasses, and they customize their teachers. It can be an old teacher, a young teacher; a teacher watches the student and teachers as the pace where a student learns. The teacher gets bored, the teacher, the virtual teacher, creates a pop quiz right there. This allows every pupil, for better or worse, to have a customized education at that pupil's ability to learn; no faster, no slower. And you can't do that in a classroom. So, if you bet against what we're betting on, then you're betting against the best and brightest technology companies in the world, and the best and brightest new developers in the world.

Google is building full-on Android for the car with Volvo and Audi Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/15 9:33am PDTMay 15, 2017 15 Plus 1 on G+ 78 Share on Facebook 50 Share on Twitter Total Shares143 Android Auto Android OS Google News Today Google has revealed more info on their new standalone Android platform for cars. Unlike Android Auto, which just casts info from your phone onto whatever software your vehicle maker has tossed together, the new system is based on Android and brings some of the same tools Android Auto had natively. Google revealed this initiative at last year's I/O, but there hasn't been much news apart from Chrysler's concept back at CES. Both Audi and Volvo will be making use of the new systems in future vehicles. Both Volvo and Audi appear to have been given a lot of leeway with the UI in the screenshots on Google's blog, things look to be skinned pretty heavily. If Google is allowing car makers that degree of flexibility, I wouldn't expect too much in the way of material design love when it lands in more cars. Even so, more tools and features from Android making their way into your car could come in handy, OEM-skin or not. Not to mention the utility of having some of the same features you did before via Auto without needing your phone around. Google revealed last year that they were thinking about the potential of bringing full Android to cars and showed off a prototype Maserati modified to run the experimental software at last year's I/O (Maserati was not involved, Google and Qualcomm shoehorned the tech into a car on their own). Google has been quiet since then about any news related to the new initiative, or any new names for the program. Given how close this is to I/O there is a good chance we'll hear more at Google's event. Source: Google Tags Android android auto audi cars vehicles volvo subscribe ...

JD In one of the security updates it'll stop my Exhaust from exhausting outside and instead in to the cabin. Don't worry tho it goes away after a reboot and doesn't affect all models. George Google's motto: let's abandon an OS/app/service before it becomes too popular by starting from scratch with another OS/app/service... TechGuy22 LOL you're going to have a ball at this year I/0 since so many shit going to be announced that will get killed off after 6 months George bro, it's been like that EVERY year... get wit the program lol makapav It really took form last year. Spaces, Allo, Duo. That was a whole bucket list. Dennis Ulijn I have a feeling Spaces was made just because they needed some centralized message board idea for I/O. Just in time for I/O and google never looked back... Months later when another app was coming out with the Spaces name they found out it was still alive. Drakenoid Spaces was pretty good, though now we've moved to Classroom and pretty sure it won't get shuttered because schools. Ryne Hager I gotta say this here, since I can't elsewhere. But, I used to think you were just a entertaining mild troll, but given your comments elsewhere I have come to see that you are the entertaining mild troll we need. Keep it up. Kawshik Ahmed At least in this Android never had a official 'Standalone In-Vehicle Infotainment' like QNX and Tizen. There are some unofficial attemps like Hyundai uses Android 2.3 and Honda uses Android4.2 in their car IVI. But this will much safer because Google is working with them. Shining Wing So what happens when the car stops receiving updates? One of the main reasons for Auto using your phone was that you only needed to worry about your phone and app being up-to-date, and phones are a lot more replaceable than cars when the updates stop. Kawshik Ahmed Do you know Hyundai Sonata cars run on Android 2.3 !!!!!! and Honda cars run on Android 4.2 ?? People don't panic about this cars because they don't know they are running Android and not just any Android very very old version of Android but those cars are all fine. Specialized OS's don't need updates. Aaron Anything that connects to the internet needs to be updated, at least for security purposes. And these systems will have to be connected at some level for Maps updates and messages. instinct Yes, people don't care because that's the norm. However, if in 2027 you are running a car with a ten year old OS and someone else is running a current OS, people may start to care. The big problem I see right now is that Android Auto now doesn't really seem to have any aftermarket products with really good screens. Ryne Hager That is an excellent question. I hope we get more info at I/O. syxbit When I bought my last TV, I deliberately got one without Android TV, because of the pathetic updates. I just purchased a Shield. I'm happy to buy a new Shield TV every 2-3 years, but I'm expecting my TV to last 5+ years. This is exactly what I'll do with my next car purchase. I'd rather the car just support the old Android Auto, so I can keep getting new phones every 1-2 years. I will never purchase a car with Android built in unless there's a clear promise of updates for MANY years. Ryne Hager I very much agree. Wait till you see my "What we use" post. I have a feeling you're gonna love it. marcusmarcus2 How often are the infotainment systems in cars updated now? If "Project Treble" comes into fruition, then it could actually improve infotainment system updates compared to current ones. Sean Leckie XDA? :) Suyash Bansal Maybe they could use the new update mechanism they are talking about Android O which makes it easier for manufacturers to update device. h4rr4r That will never get updated. The car should just display the phone screen. Jon Fridman I was going to buy a Volvo XC60 later this year, hopefully AA integration will work better than some other cars. It won't be the new version like they're working on, but at least it'll be there. Alexey Vasilyev I have Volvo XC60 MY14 running Sensus Connected Touch (Android 2.3). UI is very fluid. But I got a lot of problems. First Volvo want 400 EUR per year to keep iGO maps updated. I made a root and installed Waze - it works very good. But 3 years have passed (not a lot for cars) and now some features are not working. For example Liveradio app (which is just a list of radio URLs) is not working anymore - server shutdown. I think the best way for such systems is to use Mirrorlink. At least you can keep apps updated. JD Wooo Now I gotta get a new car every 2 years Bru [971] That's funny. Audi was reticent to add Android Auto support to it's cars Deeco "Car has unexpectedly stopped working" icyhotmike I bought a headunit with Dual bluetooth pairing, HD, Spotify, I Heart Radio, Pandora, every damn app.. built into it... for $99 (Kenwood KMM-BT318U) It even has an "Android" mode (no idea what it does) So don't waste your money Volvo and Audi Suyash Bansal That's not Android Auto. It's Android Open Accessory protocol (AOA) that lets you control phone-based content icyhotmike I got android auto app on my phone. marcusmarcus2 This would hav ebeen good news a couple years ago when I was hoping for my Nexus Lexus...Pixel ruined that dream. boop Auto may be the only extension of Android that Google's handled well. By making it an app it's not dependent on either the car or the phone for updates, you don't even need to buy a new car or head unit as you can just run it on your phone and, working under the assumption that this is built on O with Treble, updating the car itself shouldn't even be an issue (unlike all the Android TVs stuck on Marshmallow and the Watches still waiting on Wear 2.0). Paul Lemelin Harley needs to go in this direction and I don't care if it's an Android or iOS solution because their Harmon Kardon Infotainment system is the absolute WORST! Shahin iPhone users be like, "will it also come with lag, malware and inconsistent updates?" Suyash Bansal At least it'll work better compared to Apple's Carplay 😂 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeESbGPl_Dw Harsh patil Does this mean a slow death to Android Auto from now until such OS is lanuched? JG Tesla should be involved with this. They already have a big tablet installed front and center. And, from what I heard, Tesla had approached Google in regards to potentially using Android for their system. Google informed them Android wasn't, then, ready to be used in cars. But obviously now... It would allow Tesla to quickly add more apps available. Then you could use any music streaming service, without having to wait for Tesla to build the app for their platform.

How to build an SEO strategy to dominate your market Want to build an SEO strategy that can withstand algorithm updates, growing competitors and industry fluctuations? Columnist Jeremy Knauff explains how to do this by rethinking your approach. Jeremy Knauff on May 15, 2017 at 12:23 pm More Do you want an SEO strategy that goes beyond incremental growth? One that is defensible by being inherently more difficult for your competitors to replicate? And one that sets you apart from your competitors? Then you’re in the right place, because that’s exactly what we’re going to outline here today. First and foremost, you need to understand the difference between a strategy and a tactic. Don’t feel bad if you’re unsure of the difference, because I frequently hear smart people use both words interchangeably despite the fact that they have completely different meanings. Here’s an easy way to remember: a strategy is a plan to achieve a specific competitive advantage, while a tactic is a method used to achieve it. If that’s still a little confusing, let’s use Google as an example. Their strategy was to become synonymous with search in order to dominate the market, and today, it’s clearly evident that they’ve been successful. Some of the tactics they used to achieve that included: developing a more effective link-based algorithm that, at the time, was less susceptible to manipulation than simple algorithms based on content alone. funding their growth via AdWords, which simultaneously put their brand in front of more eyeballs and got more people (especially website owners) involved with their products. releasing Gmail as a free service to compete with Microsoft’s Hotmail, which put their brand in front of more eyeballs and got more people involved with their products. acquiring Urchin and renaming it Google Analytics, which gave them significantly more data points to refine their algorithm. It also put their brand in front of more eyeballs (website owners again) and got more people involved with their products. Are you seeing a pattern here yet? Every major business decision (tactic) made by Google played a direct role in achieving their goal (strategy). As a result, it’s been years since any other search engine has even put a dent in Google’s market share of search. Now that we’re clear on the difference between a strategy and a tactic, we’re going to explore three strategies you can use to dominate your market, along with the tactics necessary to do so. 1. Banish conventional thinking on keyword research and content development It’s easy to think, “I sell widgets, so I want to rank for ‘widgets.'” But it’s also lazy to stop there. Sure, if you sell widgets, you absolutely should work to rank for the term “widgets,” as well as variations of the term, such as: [color] + widgets [brand] + widgets [size] + widgets But no matter how many variations you include, you’ll only scratch the surface of potential topics to drive organic search traffic. That’s why it’s essential to go beyond conventional thinking and identity a greater number of lucrative, relevant topics — many of which will deliver organic traffic faster, with less effort, than the obvious keywords that everyone else is competing for Here are a few unconventional tactics to diversify your keyword research and content development. Ancillary products and/or services Do customers use your widgets as a part of another machine? Do they need a specific tool to install or use them? Do your widgets require other products, such as lubrication or calibration devices, to function property? If you answered “yes” to any of those questions, you’ve just multiplied potential topics exponentially! Writing about the products and/or services that support or are highly relevant to your own opens a whole new realm of keyword phrases. To be more clear, the concept of “keyword phrases is dead,” as I explained in a recent article on the role of artificial intelligence in SEO, so perhaps a better word would be “topics.” Think of it as buckets of topically themed words. There are a few hidden benefits of producing content on ancillary products and services: These other companies aren’t in competition with you, so they will be more likely to share and link to your content — especially since it helps promote them. You will attract visitors at an earlier stage in the buying process. Providing more information across a broader range of topics within your niche will help you appear more knowledgeable and authoritative. Let’s use the SEO industry as an example. In this case, ancillary products and services for which you could produce content will mostly be marketing-related. These products/services might include: domains web hosting premium WordPress themes and plugins website backup services email marketing services CRM software productivity tools CDN services printing social media tools podcasting services and equipment call tracking reputation management analytics conversion optimization web design Interview industry leaders Unless you’ve spent the last few decades working as a contract assassin for the CIA, you’re probably excited about having your name mentioned in the media. That’s true whether it’s Forbes, The Huffington Post, or even a tiny industry publication, and that feeling almost never goes away. You can use this to your advantage by interviewing industry leaders, which gives you a way to produce amazing content, and the best part is that your interviewees produce most of it for you! It also makes you appear more trustworthy and authoritative in the eyes of your audience, because they begin to associate you with the leaders in your industry. An added benefit is that you actually will rise to their level faster, but the benefits don’t stop there, because it can also help you reach a new, larger audience because the interviewee will share and/or link to their own interview. And this tactic gives you a way to add value from the beginning of the relationship, which separates you from the majority of people who contact them asking for something. You don’t need to be Oprah to effectively interview the leaders in your industry. Here are a few things you can ask them about to get the ball rolling: Their background, education and work experience How and why they chose to do what they do (The why is especially important) Books they’ve written or recommend Their mentors, heroes or role models Podcasts they host or recommend Events they speak at or attend as guests Publications they contribute to Products or services they recommend From a technical perspective, I recommend recording the call so that you don’t have to worry about keeping up as you type or write. Just let the software do the work, then hire a transcriber on Fiverr to type it for you. This helps you to be efficient and respectful of the interviewee’s time. Review competing products/services It may sound crazy, but writing content about your and their products and/or services can create tremendous opportunities for you, as long as yours are superior in some way. In fact, this tactic was the foundation for one of my most successful SEO campaigns early in my career. It’s important not to bash your competitors, because that will just make it look like you’re trying to overcompensate. Instead, clearly and objectively explain the differences, highlighting the pros and cons of each choice, allowing visitors to make an educated decision based on the facts. When using this tactic, you’ll need to produce two levels of content and build both internal and external links to that content. What I’ve found to work well is creating a parent page that provides a general comparison of your products/services to those of your competitors, followed by child pages comparing each feature individually. Each of these child pages should contain an internal link to the parent page, as well as to the other child pages where relevant. I wrote a blog post on how to set up WordPress permalinks that explains this exact structure in detail, so you can use that as a step-by-step guide. Consider how customers will search Thanks to familiarity with technology, proliferation of mobile devices and the growth of artificial intelligence, the structure of searches has changed dramatically. Today, instead of opening Google and entering the search phrase “home builders,” a searcher may literally ask Google, either through their Android device or Google Home, “Which home builder in Tampa builds modern-style homes between $400,000 and $600,000?” This offers tremendous value, both for searchers and for business owners. Put yourself in the shoes of the searcher for a minute — do you really want to go through several pages of blue links to find a handful of home builders who provide what you’re looking for?  Now put yourself in the shoes of the home builder — do you want to answer inquiries from a bunch of people who are looking for a different style of house than you build? When you produce content, do so with the understanding that searchers are using longer, more complex queries and search engines are using artificial intelligence to analyze the content on your page, along with dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of additional data points to provide the single answer most likely to satisfy the searcher. To accomplish this, you need to get out of your own head and into the heads of your customers. Find out what questions they have. What words do they use when talking about your industry, products or services? How well do they understand industry terminology? Go beyond the keywords themselves and get down to the thought process that would bring someone to your website. For example, while an HVAC company would certainly want to rank for the term “air conditioning repair,” especially since we’re approaching summertime here in Florida, a query that would bring a potential customer to them earlier in the buying process might be something like, “why does my ac smell weird.” When a searcher finds out that the smell is caused by stagnant water and they’re already on the website of the HVAC company that answered their question, who do you think they will call first? 2. Build your industry’s hub This is going to take a lot of time and effort, because it requires you to build an entirely new website and fill it with loads of outstanding content in order to become a hub for your industry. When it’s executed successfully, you’ll have the opportunity to hold multiple positions in the search results, you’ll have a powerful and relevant website to link to your primary website from, and you’ll have an independent platform to further improve your own authority, expertise and trust. It’s important to mention that you must be extremely careful when linking from one website you own to another website you own, otherwise you risk being flagged for manipulative linking practices, potentially damaging both URLs. In order for this strategy to be successful, the new website needs to become the absolute authority on your industry. The idea here is that while continuing to improve your primary website, you will simultaneously build a second website that will contain information and resources like: industry news industry specific business advice laws that pertain to your industry interviews with industry leaders forms, templates and other documents resources and tools trade publications (web, print and audio) trade organizations and networking groups industry events Basically, you want visitors to be able to find anything related to your industry here. In order to maximize this strategy, you need to give visitors a reason to return frequently and to send other people there. A members’ directory is a great way to do that, and a social network is an even better way. Imagine if you could create your industry’s version of LinkedIn or Facebook, so that visitors can friend their industry contacts and receive updated on their activity — how powerful would that advantage be over your competitors? While you will have to produce a tremendous amount of unique content for this website, you can recycle at least some of the research conducted for content on your primary website, but I would recommend assigning different writers for each website to reduce similarities. 3. Become an influencer I know, you’re probably thinking it’s easier said than done, right? But you can do it if you’re willing to put in the hard work that most others won’t, and it’s well worth the effort, because once you’re a recognized leader in your industry — especially within your target market, you won’t have to work nearly as hard to earn exposure and links. In fact, when done well, you can actually get your target market to help promote you and your company. I’ll share a perfect example. I’ve been in the digital marketing industry for 18 years, so I’m well known here, but I’ve recently started focusing on providing our digital marketing services to businesses in the construction industry, where initially, no one knew me. I set out to change that, and as a result of my efforts, I was asked to become a contributor for two large construction publications and was recently quoted at length in The Huffington Post about how military veterans are helping to solve the construction industry’s hiring challenges. I was even able to get that reporter to include several influential people I knew from the construction industry in that article, which created tremendous exposure for them in a top-tier publication. I didn’t ask them for anything. I didn’t say, “If you do this for me, I’ll do that for you.” I simply encouraged the reporter to include them because their opinions on the topic were relevant and valuable. It improved the story for the publication’s audience. But here’s what happened as a result — I immediately became more valuable to those people, and they immediately shared the article with their contacts. (Remember we talked earlier about how everyone loves positive media attention?) Now, instead of me telling people in my target market how great I am, the people they already know and look up to are doing it for me. Here’s the counterintuitive part — I didn’t even talk much about my company or what we do in the article. And that particular article only scratches the surface, because in addition to being quoted regularly by business publications like Forbes, The Huffington Post and Fortune, I now have the opportunity to regularly demonstrate my expertise to my target market through their own trade publications. You simply can’t buy that kind of trust. So, how do you become an influencer? I’ve been at this for a long time, however, when I reach out to someone I don’t yet know, the process is still exactly the same as it is for someone who is starting from scratch. The key is to add value early and often. In other words, never do this: It’s all about building relationships and adding value long before ever asking for anything. I personally know a lot of the people you would consider “famous” in our industry. They know they can ask me for help any time they need it, and often, when I hear they’ve run into a problem, I offer to help. It’s not a “do this for me and I’ll do that for you” thing, it’s more a matter of liking the people in my industry who I work with often. And they would do (and have done) the same for me. I’ve known some of these people for over a decade before ever asking for a favor, and I’ve known some longer but have never asked for anything. That even applies to a lot of people who are technically my competitors. Last year I was interviewed on Webcology, and between me and the two hosts, Dave Davies and Jim Hedger, there were three different digital marketing agencies on the show. Within an industry, people talk, so if you become known as a genuine person who always seeks to add value, you tend to get a lot farther a lot faster. Plus, it’s the right thing to do, and it makes you feel good anyway. Now let’s get down to the details… The first step is to create a list of the influencers you admire and respect — don’t just look at the size of their audience. Select influencers who are relevant to your target market and who share views similar to yours. Next, follow them — but not in a creepy way. Subscribe to their blog and email newsletter. Follow them on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and other social networks. If you want to be thorough, you can even set up a Google News Alert for both their name and company name. Then start engaging with them. If they share a piece of content you think your audience would find valuable, share it. Encourage your audience to follow them. Ask them questions and answer theirs. Be the first to post a worthwhile comment on their blog posts (not “Nice post!” or any other such nonsense). Link to their posts from your own. I think you get the idea. Once you’ve established a relationship with the influencers on your list, you can build a new list and start this process all over, but continue nurturing the old relationships, too. It’s important to remember not to look at the influencers on your list like a goal to be checked off. While you do want them to engage with you and share your content, if that is your only goal, don’t waste their time or your own. People will realize you’re using them, and that will will hurt both your personal and company brand.

Google is rolling out changes to AdWords Ad Rank thresholds: What you need to know Bids can carry more weight in Ad Rank thresholds based on the meaning of a query. Ginny Marvin on May 15, 2017 at 2:40 pm More Google has been accelerating the rollout of new Ad Rank thresholds since early May. Some advertisers have reported seeing shifts in AdWords CPCs since then — some minimal, some significant. Here’s a look at what’s changing. First, some background. Ad Rank determines where an ad appears on the page and is based on a calculation of max CPC, expected CTR, ad relevance, landing page experience and the expected impact of ad extensions and other ad formats. Ads need to meet Ad Rank thresholds, or minimums, in order to show on the first page of results. Typically, thresholds are higher to show at the top of the page above the organic results than they are for ads to show at the bottom of the page. In addition to position, thresholds can also vary depending on factors such as country and device. There are two key factors in the Ad Rank threshold change rolling out now: 1. Ad Rank thresholds account for meaning of the query With this change, Ad Rank thresholds can be based on the meaning of the query. On its face, this seems like it would be obvious, but it hasn’t actually been a threshold factor in the past. I thought this might have to do with the recent changes to exact match, but I was wrong. A Google spokesperson told Search Engine Land over the weekend, “We can also confirm that this started ramping up at the beginning of May, and that it isn’t related to exact match/close variants.” I also thought this might mean that audience was being taken into consideration — i.e., who is doing the querying and whether they are a part of a retargeted or similar audience list (similar audiences for Search and Shopping came out of beta May 1). But that’s not the case, either. And this change also doesn’t affect how bid adjustments are treated. Query category: What this does mean is that Google is now taking context, like whether a query is about recent news, versus a consumer product, into account. These types of query categories may have different Ad Rank thresholds, since the query meaning differs. It can also lead to fewer or more ads showing on a result. On a news-related query, for example, the threshold is likely to be relatively high, with fewer ads meeting the minimum requirement than on a product-related query. 2. Bids may be weighted more heavily in the Ad Rank calculation depending on query meaning The two changes go hand-in-hand: bids might take on more weight depending on the query meaning or category. Quality factors play a major role in determining Ad Rank, but with this change, Max CPCs may hold more weight in Ad Rank for some queries. From a statement to CMI Media from Google on the changes: While ad quality continues to play a very important role in the Ad Rank calculation, this particular improvement adjusts the thresholds such that bids may carry a larger weight in Ad Rank than in the past for some queries. You may notice that on these queries, even though you continue to have high keyword Quality Scores, that you experience a change in your core ad metrics. If you’re seeing higher CPCs, you may not see any change in reported Quality Score (and from what I’m hearing, this change can lead to higher CPCs, even on keywords with high reported Quality Scores), because it’s the bid that’s being weighed more heavily, rather than quality factors. Still rolling out These changes to Ad Rank thresholds are expected to roll out through the end of May. Since they haven’t fully launched, the help center pages have not been updated yet. If you’re seeing higher CPCs and/or lower traffic and think you’ve been impacted by the change, look at Quality Scores (as of today, advertisers can now see historical Quality Score data in AdWords) and impression share data for starters, and consider experimenting with bids. There are sure to be more recommendations coming from those who are currently dealing with the impact.

Waymo filed a lawsuit in February claiming Uber executives who previously worked at Google had taken self-driving technology with them when they left them company. Those individuals, identified as Anthony Levandowski and Lior Ron in court documents, quit working at Google to start their own self-driving car company called Otto. The company was then purchased by Uber in August. Read: What Is Greyball? Uber Used Data Collection Tools To Avoid Authorities And Operate Illegally: Report The judge granted Waymo a partial injunction and ordered the return of any and all stolen documents to Waymo, and required Levandowski have nothing further to do with the development of the technology. Levandowski already had recused himself from the development prior to Monday’s ruling, the Verge reported. “We welcome the order to prohibit Uber’s use of stolen documents containing trade secrets developed by Waymo through years of research and to formally bar Mr. Levandowski from working on the technology. The court has also granted Waymo expedited discovery, and we will use this to further protect our work and hold Uber fully responsible for its misconduct," a Waymo spokesperson told International Business Times in an email Monday. The ruling allows Uber to continue using its self-driving vehicles in California, Pennsylvania and Arizona, the states where the technology is approved. Aside from the lawsuit, Uber has had no shortage of controversy. The company had to pull its self-driving vehicles off the road in San Francisco in December after failing to obtain the proper permits. The company later obtained the permits and the cars were returned to San Francisco. In March, one of the autonomous vehicles was involved in a crash in Arizona. The somewhat ambiguous court ruling left both sides optimistic and expressing satisfaction with the outcome. “We are pleased with the court's ruling that Uber can continue building and utilizing all of its self-driving technology, including our innovation around LiDAR. We look forward to moving toward trial and continuing to demonstrate that our technology has been built independently from the ground up,” an Uber spokesperson told IBT. Read: Uber-Waymo Dispute: Our Self-Driving Technology Different From Waymo’s, Uber Says Autonomous driving aside, Uber has had issues keeping up appearances on the staff side as well. A former Uber engineer wrote in February about her time there, exposing alleged sexual harassment at the company. This reupped the #DeleteUber campaign that had taken Twitter by storm in January. The company is also under investigation for allegedly using a Greyballing tool to evade authorities where Uber is banned. Waymo recently teamed up with Lyft to bring self-driving technology to the ride-hailing world more quickly. The commercialization of autonomous vehicles would help mainstream it. The specific details of the deal have yet to be released. Join the Discussion Most Read Newsletter Everything You Need To Know, Right Now Sign up for the newsletter.

But now, rooted users will have to leap through an extra hoop if they want to watch Netflix on the go. Netflix has disabled its Android app through the Google Play app store on rooted Android phones, Android Police reported. In a statement to Android Police, Netflix confirmed the move: "With our latest 5.0 release, we now fully rely on the Widevine DRM provided by Google; therefore, many devices that are not Google-certified or have been altered will no longer work with our latest app and those users will no longer see the Netflix app in the Play Store." Read: Dear White People Premiere, Meet The Netflix Cast Google’s Widevine digital rights management is used to provide security protections to content providers who stream or offer multimedia content on Android devices. Rooting refers to unlocking access to a larger portion of the Android operating system. With a rooted phone, users can perform tasks like loading alternative Android operating system variants or customize core functions and aspects of Android. The update is ostensibly designed to target piracy, especially now that Netflix offers local downloads for offline viewing on mobile devices. With root access, it’s conceivably easier to rip shows that are locally stored on a smartphone or tablet versus a stock Android device. However, as Android Police noted, it’s still possible to install and update Netflix on a rooted Android device. To do so, you simply have to download the Netflix installation file from a third-party outlet like APKMirror and manually install it onto your smartphone. With this method, you wouldn’t have to go through the Play Store and you still could receive regular updates to the Netflix app. In the larger picture, rooting smartphones tends to be reserved for power and enthusiast users. Reliable numbers on the percentage of Android users with rooted devices are unavailable, but a 2015 study from security company Lookout found only 7 percent of federal employees polled use a jailbroken or rooted device while at work. Read: Google Confirms Android O Beta Program Will Begin Soon But the move still reflects the continued back-and-forth push between companies like Google and power users who want to customize and use their phones without hardware restrictions. Companies have an obvious incentive to ensure that their content is well-protected from piracy, but at the same time, users who root their phones to avoid headaches like carrier-mandated apps are caught up in the security update’s downsides. At the moment, competing apps from services like Hulu have yet to announce similar moves. Downloadable shows also remain an increasingly popular option for streaming services. With downloadable shows and offline viewing, users can locally save shows or movies to watch in areas where they don’t have reliable data or internet access. These scenarios could include when users are on the subway or on a flight.   Join the Discussion Most Read Newsletter Everything You Need To Know, Right Now Sign up for the newsletter.

RSS ALL ARTICLES FEATURES ONLY Search How to Automate Your Kids’ Bedtime With Stringify By Eric Ravenscraft on May 15th, 2017 When you tell your kids it’s time for bed, they’re going to push that limit as much as possible. But, why not let a bed time “bouncer” enforce your rules by automating your kids’ routine with Stringify and your smart lights? RELATED ARTICLE How to Use Stringify For Crazy Powerful Home Automation Stringify is a powerful automation tool that lets you tie all of your smart gadgets and online services together. If you’ve never used it before, check out our primer on it, and then come back here to build the Flow. For our example, we’re going to use the Alexa, Philips Hue, and Timer Things. Our Flow will be able to start a bedtime timer using a voice command to Alexa. The timer will dim your children’s lights a little bit fifteen minutes before bedtime, then dim them even more five minutes before bedtime. When the timer’s up, the lights will turn off entirely. We’ll set up this Flow to only trigger when you activate it. This means you can let your kids stay up later on certain nights without throwing off the routine. However, if you’d like to stick to a rigid schedule, you can replace the Alexa trigger with a Date & Time trigger and set this Flow to always activate at the same time every weeknight. To get started, open the Stringify app, tap the round plus button at the bottom, and then choose “Create a new flow” from the popup list.   At the top, tap “Name your flow” and give it a name.   Next, tap the plus icon at the bottom of the screen to add your Things. From the list, choose Alexa (or Google Assistant, if you prefer), your child’s smart light, and a Timer. When you’ve selected them all, tap Add at the top right of the screen. Back on the grid screen, drag the Alexa Thing out onto the grid. Then, tap the settings gear peeking out from behind the Alexa icon. In the list of triggers, there’s only one item: “Ask Alexa to run a flow.” Tap it, then give your Flow a unique activation phrase. In our example, we used “time for bed.” When you want to activate your Flow with a voice command, you’ll say “Alexa, tell Stringify time for bed.” You can set up an identical voice command using Google Assistant if you have Google Home or would like to use the voice command on your Android phone instead.   Back on the grid screen, drag your Hue (or other) light and Timer actions out onto the grid in the column next to Alexa, as shown below. Tap the settings gear next to the Hue action. From the list of actions, choose “Turn on to a color.” Then tap Whites along the top of the next screen. Choose a color temperature and brightness for your light, and then tap “Save.”   Back on the grid screen, tap the settings gear next to your Timer action. Under the list of triggers, tap the “Start the timer” action. Tap the Countdown box, set the timer for ten minutes, and then tap Save. We’ll start another timer for five minutes after this one is finished for a total fifteen minute countdown to bedtime. You can adjust your timers as necessary for your routine.   Back on the grid screen, it’s time to start creating your flow. Swipe from the Alexa icon to the Timer icon to create a link. Next, swipe from the Hue icon to the yellow circle in the first link you just created. The result should look like the second image below. This will cause the Alexa trigger to activate both the Hue light and the Timer at once.   Now it’s time to add a couple more actions. Tap the plus button at the bottom, choose the bedroom light and Timer Things just like you did before, and then drag them to your grid so they’re arranged like the image below shows. When you’ve added them to your grid, tap the settings gear for the new Hue light action. RELATED ARTICLE Artificial Light Is Wrecking Your Sleep, and It’s Time to Do Something About It Choose “Turn on to a color” from the list of actions. Once again, tap “Whites” and choose the color for your light. However, this time around, set the light to 30% brightness. This will be your kids’ cue that they should start winding down. Plus a dimmer, warmer light will help ease them into sleep more easily than, say, a bright blue light. When you’re done, tap “Save.”   Back on the grid screen, tap the settings gear next to the second Timer action. Choose the “Start the timer” action, just like before. This time, set the timer for five minutes. Tap “Save” when you’re done.   Back on the grid screen, connect the first Timer action to the second Hue action by swiping between them. Then, swipe from the second Timer action to the yellow link you just created, as shown by the arrows in the image on the left. The result should look like the image on the right.   To cap it all off, we’ll add one more Hue action. Tap the plus icon at the bottom and add the bedroom light Thing just like you’ve done before. Drag it to the grid next to your second timer, as shown below. Then, tap the settings gear next to the new Hue light action. This time, choose “Turn off the light” from the actions list. That should give your kids a pretty strong indication that it’s time to sleep. On the next screen, tap “Save.”   Back on the grid screen, swipe from the second timer to the last Hue action to connect them. The end result should look like the image on the right.   Finally, tap “Enable Flow” to turn the whole thing on and finally get your kids to go to sleep. Now, whenever you want to kick off your kids’ bedtime routine, just shout “Alexa, tell Stringify time for bed,” and your kids will have fifteen minutes before it’s lights out.

No Netflix for You Next StoryMore Channels Added to YouTube TV’s $35/Month Base Lineup by Kellex on May 15, 2017 @droid_life Apps News Home Share this Story Is Google Home Finally Getting Reminder Controls? With Google I/O shenanigans going down this week, we fully expect to get some sort of big update to Google Home. After initially announcing the platform at last year’s I/O, it only makes sense that Google take some time to talk about what they have planned going forward. According to XDA, who dove into a recent update to the Google Home app, we may finally get reminder controls, as well as some other key goodies.  An update to the Google Home app (v2.3) has provided a bunch of hints at upcoming features for Home. The most important – at least to those of us who think a smart home assistant speaker should be able to remind us of things – might be in the app’s future ability to list reminders. Now, according to a string in the app’s update, we should soon see an item in the slideout menu of the Home app for “Reminders,” similarly to how see Home Control, Music, and Shopping List. Of course, this isn’t a full confirmation that we’ll be able to tell Google Home to set reminders by voice, but you have to imagine that’s the point. All of the other items in that list are Google Home features that you can control via voice, so this is likely a clear sign that you’ll soon be able to say, “Hey, Google, remind me to order Amazon’s Alexa in an hour, when I once again realize it took you 9 months to be able to set reminders.” As for other goodies possibly coming to Google Home in the near future, something called “cloudcast” showed up, which could be a hint at a new feature that allows you to cast to a Home without being on the same network. That’s a pretty soft explanation, but we should hear more in a couple of days. The app update is also listing possible Google Assistant integration from third party companies, assuming the string, “device_type_google_assistant_speaker” is the giveaway. That would mean third party hardware that can include Google Assistant, like other speakers, NVIDIA’s Spot, etc. The Google I/O keynote kicks off Wednesday morning! Via: XDA Post navigation Previous StoryRooted Android Device? No Netflix for You Next StoryMore Channels Added to YouTube TV’s $35/Month Base Lineup kirko77 I need this: – Send messages (sms or at least Allo/Hangouts). – Make calls. – Access my work calendar that’s linked to my Google Calendar.. it’s ridiculous that it doesn’t! PeacedOut I’m fully expecting I/O to confirm that it’s time to jump to Alexa… For a reminder to everyone, here is last years I/O Demo for Google Home… and the list of things it does in the video but still doesn’t do in real life, in order of the video….. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KpLHdAURGo (1) Play a predefined playlist (2) Ability to cast to multiple speakers via voice command mid song (3) Travel notifications, or really any notification (4) Carry a conversation with varying tasks, not having to say “okay google” every time (5) Dinner reservations? Might do this, but IDK it’s going on the list (6) Send text messages (7) Package tracking (8) Carry a conversation (9) Cast using natural conversation “Cast on the TV” (10) Push notifications to your phone / Voice recognition (until recently) I’m guessing they are going to resuse this video. rslh GH does play my pre-defined playlists. Alexa does as well but GPM lets me upload up to 50,000 songs vs 250 on Amazon, unless I pay extra. PeacedOut Please tell me the command because every time I say “Play my thumbs up playlist” is say’s, “I can’t do that” rslh I have a playlist named “Ambient” set up and I ask “Ok/hey Google, play my ambient playlist.” OP Michael below also confirmed. I don’t utilize the thumbs up feature myself. I think naming your playlists is the key to voice recognition. Ryan It will probably work for 6 months and then Google will decide they need to do more to push the flagging “Google Express” and break all useful functionality and move them to a Google Express web page with 1/5th the functionality. bretjutras The Echo doesn’t support reminders and has been out for 2.5 years. Getting this feature after 6 months doesn’t seem all that awful to me. Michael Hopefully, we can expect GH to be able to play music from my own library without having to put them all in a play list. Kris V Ever since they sent my grocery list to the Home app, the only thing I ask my Google Home is what the weather is like. Other than that, not really helpful. jstew182 Yeah I am annoyed they pulled the list from Keep. It makes it so much less useful in my opinion…I feel like it could show in both places. TurtlePowah Agreed. It used to be so easy to share the list with my wife and now it’s just a PITA Ryan Honestly when they broke that I tell everyone its only worth the $75 I got it for, and that is WITH the smartthings integration. Breaking that makes it nothing more than a google search and music player, which is hardly worth over $100. Hell, you still cant cast from Google Play movies with it. Bryan I hated that as well. We used Keep extensively, so when they did this I searched for another grocery app that worked with Google Home. I found OurGroceries works really well. The app is actually much better for shopping lists than Keep, but accessing via Google Home does have an extra step. Instead of saying “Hey Google, add milk to my shopping list”, I now have to say “Hey Google, ask OurGroceries to add milk to my Costco list.” The best thing is that you can have multiple lists (we have Costco, Fry’s, Sam’s Club, Walmart lists) and it can add and read back any list to you. Honestly, even if they went back to Keep, I’d probably still use OurGroceries for the ability to have multiple lists and have it read back any of the lists to you. But I use my Google Home for both SmartThings integration with my lighting (family loves this) but also for my entertainment center with a Harmony Companion and Hub. My wife now knows how to turn the TV on and off by just saying “Hey Google, ask Harmony to turn on the TV”. No more fiddling with the remote and keeping it pointed at the TV while the “macro” fires. Plus my kids use it for music listening like crazy, and casting youtube videos to the TV. b_boogey_xl Hmmm, now I wonder which version of Reminders will this link to…? Inbox? Keep? Google App? Calendar? I say Google App. What say you? Kellex B I’d ask Google, but it probably can’t even figure that out. mcdonsco Is Google home actually useful yet? RyanT If you have a bunch of smart home products, yes. If you just want a cast enabled speaker , yes. If you are lonely and want a robot telling you that you’re pretty or telling you jokes, yes. Otherwise, no. kirko77 What do you use Echo for? I use GH daily for: – music playback (actually somewhat decent speakers for background music) – timers – checking traffic in morning – asking for latest news in morning Best part? Multi-user support via voice recognition. I don’t want my Google account preference stats be polluted by my wife’s and kid’s requests. This is enough for me. I mean, even if it just played music, it’s already a good enough device IMO… everything is a cherry. J. Carter Yeah it works for my Hue lights, Nest, and a couple of plugs without any issues. The casting to multiple speakers can be flaky though. The shopping list move was just weird and pointless, might as well kill Google Keep. But as I add hue lights it is weird to hear her reel off like 6 lights when I ask her to turn on a scene.

The app will only be available in the US at launch and will be released in other regions later. So far, the only way to access Google Assistant on iOS was through Allo. Of course, there is Google Now available through the Google Search app. We are not sure whether the Assistant functionality will be part of the Search app or a different app altogether. The Assistant feature is expected to arrive shortly and it is speculated that it will be announced during Google I/O this week.

Google Photo credit: Glassdoor 11/11 SLIDES Large companies spend a great deal of time and money on maintaining their brand image. Although that image can shift quickly when crisis strikes, a large firm’s reputation typically holds steady for longer than you might think.     Today research and advisory firm  Universum Global released its list of the most attractive employers among undergraduate business students. Over the past six months, Universum recruited 26,809 students at 359 U.S. universities to take a 20-minute survey, asking them questions about which firms they held in highest regard. Quotes in the article Walt Disney Co DIS ▼ 109.13 -0.56 -0.51% JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM ▲ 87.34 +0.42 +0.48% Goldman Sachs Group Inc GSPRA ▼ 23.70 -0.28 -1.17% To view the most attractive employers for business students in 2017, open the gallery above. Google was named the most attractive employer, maintaining its number-one spot from last year. Business students think the tech giant is an innovative place to work, says Jonna Sjövall, a senior vice president at Universum. “People really know Google’s work environment because Google has been very vocal about it,” she adds. Disney came in second place, also holding onto its ranking from 2016. Business students see Disney as having a creative and friendly culture, according to Sjövall. J.P. Morgan and Goldman Sachs ranked sixth and seventh. Sjövall says students tend to view banks as old fashioned and not particularly creative, but both J.P. Morgan and Goldman have held onto their top-ten spots for years. “They have a strong strategy in attracting the people they’re interested in,” says Sjövall. Professional services firm EY ranked eighth. It beat every other “big four” accounting firm (Deloitte, PwC and KPMG) in the ranking, although it fell three spots from last year, when it came in fifth. Every big four firm lost ground on this year’s list. Natasha Stough, campus recruiting director of EY’s Americas region, says the market for talent has become increasingly competitive. Investment banks and consulting firms still draw strong interest, and tech companies like Google and Facebook are eating up entry-level talent. “If you look at Google, their position as far as some of the offers they have, the campuses they have on the West Coast — it’s impressive,” Stough says.  EY recruited 5,500 entry-level staff hires and 3,500 interns over the past year. And what attracts students to the 231,000-person company? It’s known as being a great place to start a career, Sjövall says, and to have a friendlier culture than the rest of the big four. It has a reputation for being “flexible, open and collaborative,” says Stough. For instance, EY offers 16 weeks’ parental leave to men and women. Employees have taken the company up on that offer — since last July, 82 men have taken 16 weeks’ parental leave.   Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Money Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry!

New Volvos including the XC90 feature one of the most advanced infotainment systems on the market, but the automaker still sees room for improvement. Volvo has partnered with Google to develop an infotainment system based on the Android operating system, and it’s expected to launch on new models within two years. The Android-backed infotainment system will give drivers access to hundreds of apps developed by Google, Volvo, or third-party developers. These apps will be incorporated into the existing infotainment format that Volvo drivers will find familiar. “Google’s platform and services will enhance the user experience by enabling more personalisation possibilities, while Android will offer increased flexibility from a development perspective,” said Henrik Green, Senior Vice President Research & Development at Volvo Car Group, in a recent release. Volvo also announced it’s updating recent models with Google Local Search, a location-based service application. This feature will be released through an update to customers with Sensus Navigation. Expect to learn more on Volvo’s partnership with Google at this year’s Google I/O conference on May 17.

[Deal Alert] Get a free official case when you buy a Pixel XL from the Google Store Richard Gao Follow View All Posts 2017/05/14 8:30am PDTMay 14, 2017 11 Plus 1 on G+ 51 Share on Facebook 44 Share on Twitter Total Shares106 Deals Google News Pixel XL It's been a couple of months since the Pixel and Pixel XL debuted, but it's still rare to come across a deal for them, especially on the XL model. In fact, we've posted a total of zero Deal Alerts on the non-Verizon Pixel XL. However, Google itself has decided to offer a free official case to anyone who purchases the Pixel XL from the Google Store. It's pretty simple: add any color/storage level of Pixel XL to your cart, then add either the $30 clear case or the $35 silicone case (your choice of color) to your cart. In your cart, you'll see the 'Buy Pixel XL, receive a Pixel XL Case by Google on us' text, along with a discount of either $30 or $35, depending on which case you got. Unfortunately, this doesn't work on any Live Cases, the LifeProof FRE, or the Otterbox Defender. Want to get in on this deal? Google simply says that the offer will be 'available while supplies last' from when it began at 12am PT today (May 14th). So if you've been eyeing a Pixel XL and a case, but were waiting for some sort of little incentive, now may be the time to pull the trigger.

Google simply says that the offer will be 'available while supplies last" I'm pretty sure they mean while supplies of the phone lasts... Because they'll be out of stock again long before this offer ends. irtechneo Lol yep. Their inventory issues are mind boggling. I finally gave up trying to get one and went with S8+. Glad I did. Andrea Bittau I want to do the same but s8 ( normal )... how is bixby button ? useless ?! :/ irtechneo Bixby button is great! I use the app called bxActions and re-map it to the Google app. I now have a dedicated button for Google. Fantastic. Bixby itself is garbage (IMO). Michael Hannigan Don't. G6 is a better deal and a better phone. And I am a Samsung fanboy/fanman. Michael Hannigan Yeah, great move. Except the Pixel is a much better device. irtechneo In your​ opinion that may be true. Not in mine. I honestly don't like anything about the pixel hardware..I think it is one of the ugliest phones I have ever seen. The software experience can't be beat but that isn't all I factor into my purchasing decisions. Michael Hannigan You are right when you say that the overall experience cannot be beat. Michael Hannigan Ouch, ouch! shamatuu I can buy a laptop with that price longer with 769 bucks Cowboydroid You could get a used Pixel laptop for about half that price. Mix My laptop with a GTX 1050, 8gb of ram and an i7 quad core processor was cheaper than my 128gb PIxel XL, Canadian............. Never again. TechGuy22 So expensive Thanks to my 6p I got to buy the xl 128 gb only for 300 bucks. Kyle Null If you don't NEED a phone right now, you really shouldn't​ buy the Pixel. Wait for the Pixel 2 or something better. EowynCarter Yeah, I think that even if google where to finally make the pixel available in France, I would wait. I just hope google get their act together and actually do a worldwide release and my nexus 6 don't suffer some sudden death. Tk JunkMail My Nexus 6 is running Android 7 and Google Fi and is as fast as ever. No reason to replace it. EowynCarter Mine sometimes get laggy. Plus, no Android O. :( That's a shame. Michael Hannigan Google, like the rest of the world, really doesn't care about France. Sean O’Connor Problem is that waiting is what got me into this situation in the first place. I didn't buy a 6P last summer since the Pixel​ was around the corner, and I've only started seeing the model I want available within the past few weeks. I could wait again, but by the time I'm lucky enough to see the Pixel 2 I want in stock on the play store people will be talking about the Pixel 3. There is always some better device to wait for, but at a certain point I just need to get a new phone. Kyle Null I'm​ still using the Nexus 5 because I'm waiting for Google to release a reasonably priced device. At this rate, I might still be using the Nexus 5 in 2030. Vinayak Prabhu I was in the same boat, but finally jumped on to the S8+ Michael Hannigan Ouch! Andy I was in same boat. I ended up getting a moto z play. Its amazing for the price. I'll get the pixel 2 in the fall. Michael Hannigan It's a piece of crap, but a good piece of crap for the price. You seem to be one of the few reasonable peeps here. Michael Hannigan True dat, hookah. You hit da nail on da head. Tk JunkMail The Nexus 6 is running Android 7 and Google Fi and is as fast as ever. No reason to replace it. Cowboydroid My Nexus 6 was slow even on marshmallow. It was almost unusable on 7. Had to root and revert back. john gregson No more Google. 6P very poor for a person who deals with emotionally distressed clients. 8 hours maximum juice. Michael Hannigan Maybe you need to get better clients. Duder12 That shit battery life was a Qualcomm issue not a Google issue. Michael Hannigan You should have done a factory reset. That would have fixed it. Cowboydroid I did multiple resets. Michael Hannigan Ok, finally! Good. It's probably all set, then. You're welcome. Cowboydroid Mmmmm. Michael Hannigan But the Nexus 6 was/is a great phone. One of the best, if not the best, Nexus made. Alex Higgins The clear cases should have been free from the outset... Broke in me 3 months in. I'd pass on even the free one and opt for an awesome one on Amazon for half the price. Can't vouch for the silicone ones. Michael Hannigan "...pass on the free one"? Didn't think about that too long before blurting it out, did you? Alex Higgins Didn't have to. Had one, wasn't worth $30, isn't worth having even if it's free. Phone's great, though. Michael Hannigan That doesn't make sense. Alex Higgins Obviously, given the rest of your comments, you're offended by anyone with an opinion different from yours. So, in the interest of offending you further, I'll reply again. It makes sense if I want my phone to be protected. That clear case actually scratched my phone on the corners. So, yeah. Makes plenty of sense to me. Free != Good. Michael Hannigan I'm afraid you have overestimated my concern. Nothing in a comment section an online forum could offend me. I can't really be offended by people who don't know me. But to be realistic, I would suggest you just accept the free gift - since refusing it would either mean not getting your phone at all or delaying your shipment while you try to explain how you want it shipped in a special way from everyone else - without the free case. Idiotic. I guess I am a little offended by your stupidity, but not in a personal way. Bobby R. Blair Don't be offended by stupidity. Stupid can't be fixed. One of my pet peaves is ignorance. Ignorance is a choice. Now that does offend me. jamaniek LOL, 769$ still. Google is ridiculous with the pricing. M6 That's not ridiculous. If they have such limited stock and can't keep up with existing orders (granted that's their fault, they're missing out on a lot of demand), why drop the price? It would be ridiculous to drop the price at this point before they can at least fulfill existing orders jamaniek Considering people that already placed their orders and didn't receive them yet- yes I see your point and I agree. But other than that the price is way too high by today's standards. We've got better and faster phones at that price and as fast ones at lower prices. Pixel is probably still one of the best phones (if not the best) when it comes to pure user experience, but I don't think that this factor alone justifies spending this much on it. Richard Gozinya I dont think its that ridicules when its put in context, How much is a Iphone 7, a Samsung S7 edge, S8+ all about the same jamaniek iPhone 7 Plus costs 718$ on Amazon for 128GB option, S7 Edge costs 515$ and OP3T goes for 439$. S8+ is a completely different story, as it is a new, faster phone. May be overpriced, but still... Bruce It was ridiculously overpriced when it launched. Today it's laughable. Google wants to charge Apple prices without the associated services. Apple supports their phones for 4-5 years. Google guarantees OS updates for 18 months. Apple has stores you can walk in and get any problems fixed. Google finger points and doesn't accept blame with all the hardware problems. On a hardware level, the iPhones themselves have far fewer problems. Even if Google were to acknowledge a hardware problem, it doesn't have enough phones in stock to offer a replacement. One could simply swap out a problematic iPhone in a store. I would never buy an iPhone, but Apple service is deservedly legendary. I know anyone can have isolated anecdotes on either side, but I doubt anyone can argue about Apple's service. If I have to buy a used XL, I have no idea if the phone has a problem with the speaker or Bluetooth or call volume. Guess what that does the resale value. Google has got a long way to go before they should even dare to charge $870 for a 128GB XL. The Nexus 6P and the Nexus 5 were priced appropriately for the service provided by Google. Anything over $500, is overpriced for a phone from Google. Duder12 How do you not get that it was a marketing move? The price says it's competition to the iPhone. Had they launched the pixel 1 at a lower price it would have never recovered. Duder12 You don't. We do. Elsiedamado Google is paying 97$ per hour! Work for few hours & have longer with friends and family! !sg84c: On tuesday I got a great new Land Rover Range Rover from having earned $8752 this last four weeks.. Its the most-financialy rewarding I've had.. Follow this link for more information !sg84c: ➽➽ ➽➽;➽➽ http://GoogleFinancialCashJobs384MarketResourcesGetPaid$97/Hour... ★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫::::::!sg84c:....,........ Cai Copley The price is crazy because due it's bland design, lack of innovation, lack of customer service, the fact updates may not extend beyond two years, no stores to buy from. Apple charges those prices because of the customer service, constant updates for 4+ years, etc so they have the cash flux to provide for that—people would rather pay a one time high price than continually pay a subscription service! Michael Hannigan I would rather continually pay for a subscription service, assuming it carries a substantial value. charlie Jason That case makes it look even more like an iPhone. Just saying. NooSH should be [Rape alert]* Margaritas Ante Porcos Is it obligatory here to say only nice things about that crap of a phone? because I have nothing but a middle finger to to this ugly overpriced underachiever. Gerardo Sarabia I don't love the design and it's far from perfect but it's still the best phone I've ever used. Michael Hannigan So you weren't able to get on, were you? Duder12 Best phone I've ever owned. putte40 If that phone could be available worldwide.... Marty Meh...I'd rather have either a Spigen or Supcase. Cowboydroid Both are massively overpriced. I'm curious to see sales stats. Me Are the cases backordered as well? matteventu Nobody wants their crappy cases. ro964 I entertained a Pixel XL purchase at one point, but never ever found stock available, save for one brief moment while speaking directly with a Project Fi customer service rep. Over time, my interest has evaporated. Today I'm using a Nexus 5X ($249) which is running Android 7.1.2 and costs me about $35/month on Project Fi. I'll take a look at the Pixel 2 whenever it's announced. If the features are what I'm looking for, maybe my interest will be renewed. For now, I'm happy with my N5X. seattle tech HAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHA RXG9 Google still charing $769? lol. I just got 2 Galaxy S8's for $750. (T-Mobile BOGO deal) Michael Hannigan Read the fine print, chump! Duder12 No kidding. Dumbass just locked himself into TMobile Luiz Marin After I got one for $15 on eBay to my pixel, I just in love with the silicone touch of it, Totally worth it Mako10 Google should stick to software, both of my nexus phones have been a joke. And with all the complaints about the pixel, they still cant get it right...and for $800 no less. Sorry but my next phone will either be a S8 or Note, or more likely an iphone. never thought id say the "i" word, but their stuff just works. Michael Hannigan It's been "a couple of months since the Pixel and Pixel XL debited"? Really? For me it's been over six months. LethalLunatic Probably does not understand the definition of "couple" Mark Conroy It's never even appeared on the Play store in Ireland, so no danger of it being overpriced in a country where Google have an enormous financial presence. Lindsay Meyer I have a Pixel, which was fortunately (or unfortunately) rather easy for me to acquire. But after reading about everyone who's been wanting one and can't get it, I would really like to say... Please, take mine. I would love my $800 back so I could go buy the Nexus 6 and spend the remaining 300 bucks on something else. Lots of cool stuff out there for $300. My husband has the Nexus 6, and let me tell you, it's very nearly the same damn phone as far as user experience is concerned. The Pixel is maybe like a $50 upgrade; I wouldn't pay more. Please don't let scarcity be the reason to try and get your hands on the Pixel, free case or not. You've been warned. Mix Petty much this! My wifes ZTE Axon 7 was 1/2 the price and has had less issues than my Pixel XL's have (I am on my 3rd one) My brother has had his Pixel XL for less than 4 months and he is already selling it. Not worth $1,340 CAD....not even close. Duder12 Yeah well same can't be said with last year's Nexus 6p and Nexus 5x. The Qualcomm processor in those phones make them an immediate no compared to the pixel. Fred #destocking Mix I have heard that these cases are utter garbage and $10 cases from Amazon are better quality. These are, apparently, super brittle and crack easily..... I would just wait as this isn't really a good deal.

The big highlight of the smartphone is tipped to be the Edge Sense feature that appears to be an interface powered by pressure-sensitive sensors alongside the smartphone's metal edge. These sensors will respond to squeezing, and perform multiple functions, something that has been teased by HTC on many occasions. Now, in a fresh leak, HTC's app called HTC Edge Sense was spotted on Google Play briefly, revealing what functions the Edge Sense feature will be able to perform. A separate report also claims that the HTC U 11 will go on sale as soon as May 19. The HTC Edge Sense app was spotted by Android Police, and they've gotten hold of screenshots hinting at various functions the metal-laden sensors will be able to perform. The app was listed briefly on Google Play without any description, and there was no ability to download it either. The first screenshot asks you to test it by pressing the edges to 'fill up a balloon' and release it to launch the balloon. This is essentially to test the feature on the upcoming HTC U 11, and get a sense of how it works. The other screenshots suggest that Edge Sense could work for taking photos, videos, firing up Google Assistant and much more. Photo Credit: Android Police A separate leak from MobileExpose claims that the HTC U 11 will go on sale soon after its big reveal on May 16. The report claims that the smartphone will go on sale in Taiwan from May 19 for TWD 19,900 (roughly Rs. 42,400). This is really close to the reveal date, and it could also be when HTC kicks-off pre-orders, and not the actual sale. However, this is pure speculation and should be taken as such. The smartphone has been tipped to run Android 7.1.1 Nougat, sport a 5.5-inch QHD display, and to be powered by the Snapdragon 835 SoC coupled with 4GB of RAM. In terms of optics, the HTC U 11 is expected to sport a 12-megapixel rear sensor, and a 16-megapixel front camera. It has been tipped to offer 64GB of internal storage as well. There is also a 6GB of RAM/ 128GB built-in storage variant expected to be launched by the company. The HTC U 11 is also expected to house a 3000mAh non-removable battery with support for Quick Charge 3.0. In terms of connectivity, the phone offers options including 4G LTE (dual-SIM in some markets), dual-band Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac, GPS with GLONASS, Bluetooth 5.0, NFC, and USB 3.1 Type-C. The fingerprint scanner on the HTC U 11 is embedded into the home button and the phone is expected to come with water and dust resistance rating of IP57. In terms of audio features, the HTC U 11 is expected to offer HTC BoomSound, Hi-Res Audio, HTC Usonic (Active Noise Cancellation), and 3D Audio Recording.

Google will announce Assistant for iOS soon, in the US only at launch David Ruddock Follow View All Posts 2017/05/15 7:28am PDTMay 15, 2017 101 Plus 1 on G+ 217 Share on Facebook 140 Share on Twitter Total Shares458 Applications Exclusives News Rumors According to a trusted source, Google plans to announce that the Google Assistant will be launching on iOS soon as a standalone app. The announcement could come as soon as Google's I/O conference this week, but it's unclear exactly what Google's plans are at this time. The app would likely feature a blend of the "chat" style functionality in the Google Allo version of Assistant and the voice-controlled version found on Android, but again, details are scant. We do know that the Assistant for iOS will only be available in the US at launch, and that Google plans to make the announcement in fairly short order. I/O would be a pretty ideal venue for such a launch, as Assistant's SDK was just made available to developers late last month. Bringing the Assistant to the world's second-largest mobile OS would likely encourage more developers to integrate with the app's functionality. As we learn more about this story, we'll bring it to you. For now, just know that Assistant on iOS is imminent. While we are labeling this story a "rumor" because we don't know what Google's exact timeframe for announcing this news is, we're highly confident that the information we were provided is accurate.

Martin You are wrong. Beta is on Android. We test it, then they release it better working on iOS... We keep testing... :-)) Bewear Sad, but true. JD Correction. Google services is always beta. When something is about to Go Gold they shut it down and offer 3 competing products. Because Fuck you that's why. - Google. Filipe Santos You won! King_Android Naw, iOS users would have the first Alpha version of GA while we wait for the rollout to hit our Android devices. Maxwell “Max” Weinbach I have had it for months. S7 Edge and Nexus 6P ADofCLE He's referring to the typical release of Google services. He was being sarcastic. rohiggidy google now/voice search is on IOS. We all expected this MaximumFish "In the US only at launch". Isn't that *still* the case for the Android version? No-one I know if the UK has got it yet, except Pixel users obviously. I've given up checking for it now. Winston Indonesian here. ALL of my devices have it. Since 2 months ago or so. krazyfrog Got it from the day they announced. You probably just need to clear your Google Play services cache or change device language to English US. Alex Yes, I believe that changing the device language to "English US" works, but that's pretty much stating that it's still US only, as you have to pretend to be from US. Shahin Just adding it as a second option works, provided you setup Assistant with US only first. That way you don't have to deal with US Englizh. MaximumFish Thinking about it, I get the sneaky suspicion that I don't have it due to having a Google Apps account. I wish they'd offer a route to migrate from Apps to a standard account. Hyperionite Indonesian here. Using English US as my default language. My device have it. Running Android 6 at the moment Latheryin Won't mean much as Apple will still leverage the use of its own over Google. Heck most android users don't use it what makes them think iPhone users will. Martin Because Google are dumb ducks... I use it, but would use it a lot more, if they make it again to Wake up the assistant from the lock screen on any device... Miss so much from my iPhone being able to say "Hey Siri" and set alarm/timer/call even without touching my phone... And not everyone wants to use Pixel phones... :) David Slawotsky Use Trusted Voice in Settings. That will allow you. Martin I guess this is only for Pixel phones. I don't have this in my settings :) Alex Trusted Voice is part of Google's Smart Lock -- it's not just for Pixel. On my stock Galaxy S7, it's under Settings > Lock screen and security > Secure lock settings > Smart Lock Latheryin To be honest I have it on my nexus and never use. It just not something I need. Let alone want to broadcast what I am doing to every one around me. It is almost as bad as people talking on speaker phone in public. Martin It's personal thing. Some will use it, some wont.. :-)) Latheryin I, see a lot less people wanting to use it on IOS. Won't be enough integration when compared. To siri. To be honest they should just keep the AI on the platform they were made for. We all saw how Apple music did on Android. AbbyZFresh Your point. Apple has Siri and Spotlight embedded in their phone and yet the Google search app is one of the most downloaded in the App Store. Latheryin Those numbers seldom mean real downloads and use. Things like download counts and reviews are seldom accurate with places selling downloads and reviews for really cheap Leandro Brandão I wish I could replace Siri with google assistant. Julie Ankrom I don't want either one. I just want "OK google" and doing a search directly, or giving orders directly. I played with Google Assistant for a while and it just adds a middleman. Leandro Brandão I never used assistant, I thought it was a better ok google. Google app always understands me and give me correct answers. JD If anything it's a worse Google Now. but it speaks more naturally? So I guess that's a good thing? I don't even fucking know anymore. OligarchyAmbulance Assistant is activated with "Ok, Google" and does what you are asking for. In what way is it worse or a "middle man" to Google Now (which it replaced)? destinyhud right when i am trying to replace my ipad with Chromebook detachable. i have hopes for Chromebook C2 at IO SupahNin10doh Thank bliming bob! I hate Siri sooo much. SupahNin10doh Now if they'd also bring it to MacOS Ghostx7x And then to Windows 10 Leonardo Baez Soooo I'm on Nexus 6P and have no assistant yet, but iphone is getting it? Outrageous Cat Astrophy http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/03/02/google-assistant-coming-android-6-0-devices/ If your phone doesn't have it blame your cell provider, not Google. Filipe Santos You have if you choose the supported languages, otherwise no. I changed but if you have your second language, your native language messages will be spoken so damn bad you can't understand or speak sh*t RickJ How does Google expect anyone to want switch from​ iPhone to their phone when they​ keep giving everything away to Apple for free? Keep some things to yourself, Google! Some exclusive incentives for them to switch. Adam Margeson Google doesn't care about switching people to Android. They only care about getting customer data. They can sort-of do that if they keep getting their apps over to iOS. And then provide subtle hints that "Android integrates all of this to make things easier... if you care to switch over." (Not to say that they do integrate things better... just look at the Assistant-on-different-devices fiasco) lauski I'd agree they don't care AS MUCH, but they do care to some degree... Look, they officially have entered the hardware business with the pixels. Right now you're right-- whatever sales they might marginalize are far outweighed by marketing dollars and customer info. The opposite is true for Apple, which is why we won't be enjoying an official iMessage and Facetime release on the Play Store any time soon... Zach Mauch I might at the "[Exclusive]" to this just so i is obvious that it is info from AP. Artem Russakovskii "I might at the "[Exclusive]" to this just so i is obvious that it is info from AP." A little attention when typing? Régis Knechtel https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/b02bffe886fcaf1c5490199c0b7fa03f201960050d66218052c281973c4f9283.gif ADofCLE I knew this was coming. They always release their products on iOS. Even though it really doesn't do anything Google Now already does. Cakefish I haven't even got it on my non-Pixel UK Android phone yet. DragoCubed Surprised yet not surprised they did this. I just wished they'd keep some more android exclusives. Nicholas C YES! I am 95% google here but have an iPhone after the whole Note7 shitstorm JD Too bad you still can't use a default assistant other than Siri. I would totally use Google Now if I could. Fucking Hate Siri that useless hunk of code. Filipe Santos Google stop being an a$$hole, why the hell you release an iOS app if you don't even release on the rest of the languages first or countries? Do you only care about profit? Damn ****** ..... jawsnnn Off topic... It was reported months ago that GA was rolling out to Nexus devices. Is that still happening? Does anyone know? Dave Cremin Lol and I haven't even got it in my 6P. Ridiculous. Brad Wilson I put the Google app on my home screen, because it's so much better than Siri. It's worth the extra step to press the button. I hope that Google assistant becomes better than what I'm using now. Premsuraj Can someone explain to me why the Voice Actions on Google Now can work with a lot of languages including hotword support, but Google Assistant only works with US & UK English? Shouldn't the voice detection be a separate component that can work with any voice assistant? Or atleast they should be able to easily reuse the current implementation Teja I got Assistant on my Oneplus 3 few weeks back, I resetted my device few days back and its gone. Its been 5 days and I'm still waiting to see it. Can anyone help? mike shwilly Ok Google, what is this song?

Photograph: Tony Avelar/AP Uber Uber allowed to continue self-driving car project but must return files to Waymo Partial victory for Uber after judge declines Waymo’s request for full injunction But star engineer Anthony Levandowski barred from working on lidar project Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close Sam Levin in San Francisco @SamTLevin email Monday 15 May 2017 15.04 EDT Last modified on Monday 15 May 2017 15.40 EDT A judge has granted a partial reprieve to Uber in its high-profile intellectual property lawsuit with Google’s self-driving car operation, allowing the ride-hailing company to continue developing its autonomous vehicle technology. Uber's alleged theft of Waymo trade secrets referred to federal prosecutors Read more The judge, however, has barred an Uber executive accused of stealing trade secrets from Google spin-off Waymo from continuing to work on self-driving cars’ radar technology, and has ordered Uber to return downloaded documents to Waymo. The judge also said that evidence indicates that Waymo’s intellectual property has “seeped into Uber’s own … development efforts” – suggesting that Uber could face a tough battle as the case moves ahead. Google’s lawyers were seeking a broader injunction against Uber, which could have significantly impeded the taxi startup’s entire self-driving car program, a move that could have been a fatal setback. The partial victory for Uber follows a judge’s recommendation that federal prosecutors launch a criminal investigation into the accusations that it stole Waymo’s technology. The decision from Judge William Alsup comes when Uber is reeling from a series of public relations crises, including a sexual harassment scandal, the release of embarrassing footage of its CEO berating a driver, numerous executive departures, a viral #DeleteUber campaign, accusations that it has spied on competitors’ drivers, and claims that it has evaded law enforcement. But the high-stakes trade secrets case with Waymo, which is owned by Google parent company Alphabet, poses perhaps the most significant threat to Uber’s future, given that the CEO, Travis Kalanick, has said autonomous technology is “existential” to the company’s $70bn business. Judge Alsup’s decision was released shortly after Waymo revealed that it is partnering with Lyft, Uber’s main competitor, on self-driving cars, dealing yet another blow to Uber in the race to dominate the nascent autonomous vehicle market, which is expected to be highly profitable. The lawsuit filed in February alleges that Anthony Levandowski, a former Waymo employee, downloaded trade secrets before leaving the company and eventually brought the “sensitive, secret, and valuable internal Waymo information” to Uber. The case centers on Waymo’s proprietary lidar system, which is the radar that self-driving cars use to see surroundings. Judge Alsup’s latest decision includes a number of orders against Uber. The judge said Uber must “immediately remove” Levandowski from any role or responsibility related to lidar and that he cannot communicate with anyone at Uber about the technology. Last month, Levandowski said he was stepping down from his role while the litigation was ongoing. In court, he has also invoked the fifth amendment, citing the “potential for criminal action”. Alsup wrote in his decision: “The bottom line is the evidence indicates that Uber hired Levandowski even though it knew, or should have known, that he possessed over 14,000 confidential Waymo files likely containing Waymo’s intellectual property; that at least some information from those files, if not the files themselves, has seeped into Uber’s own lidar development efforts; and that at least some of said information likely qualifies for trade secret protection.” But the judge also refused to entirely shut down Uber’s autonomous technology development, writing: “Waymo’s patent theories are too weak to support any provisional relief.” Alsup also accused Waymo of “overreaching in its assertion of supposed trade secrets and moving the target as discovery and briefing progressed”. Uber has begun testing self-driving cars in Arizona, California and Pennsylvania. Both companies praised the decision on Monday. Uber faces criminal investigation after evading the law with 'Greyball' tool Read more “We are pleased with the court’s ruling that Uber can continue building and utilizing all of its self-driving technology, including our innovation around lidar,” Uber said in a statement. “We look forward to moving toward trial and continuing to demonstrate that our technology has been built independently from the ground up.” Waymo noted in a statement that the judge has granted expedited discovery, which the company said it would use to “to further protect our work and hold Uber fully responsible for its misconduct”. The spokesperson added: “Competition should be fueled by innovation in the labs and on the roads, not through unlawful actions. We welcome the order to prohibit Uber’s use of stolen documents containing trade secrets developed by Waymo through years of research, and to formally bar Mr Levandowski from working on the technology.” Waymo and Lyft have declined to offer details on their new partnership, which was first reported on Sunday by the New York Times. A Lyft spokesperson told the Guardian: “Waymo holds today’s best self-driving technology, and collaborating with them will accelerate our shared vision of improving lives with the world’s best transportation.” This article was amended on 15 May to clarify the scope of the injunction that Waymo was seeking against Uber Topics Uber Waymo Google Self-driving cars Alphabet news Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Reuse this content most viewed The Guardian back to top home US politics world opinion sports soccer tech selected arts lifestyle fashion business travel environment all sections close home US politics world UK europe americas asia middle east africa australia cities development opinion sports soccer MLS NFL MLB NBA NHL soccer live scores tables competitions results fixtures clubs tech selected arts movies tv & radio music games books art & design stage classical lifestyle food recipes health & fitness love & sex family women home & garden fashion business economics sustainable business diversity & equality in business small business travel USA europe UK environment climate change wildlife energy pollution science media crosswords blog editor quick cryptic prize quiptic genius speedy everyman azed weekend video Technology › Uber back to top tech US world science US politics business more become a supporter make a contribution Facebook Twitter jobs guardian labs subscribe all topics all contributors solve technical issue about us advertise with us contact us work for us complaints & corrections terms & conditions privacy policy cookie policy securedrop © 2017 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

"At least some information from those files, if not the files themselves, has seeped into Uber's own Lidar development efforts." Uber was ordered to return all downloaded materials to Waymo by noon on May 31. BY THE ASSOCIATED PRESS, Updated: May 15, 2017 1:23 pm Follow @AuroraSentinel DETROIT | A federal judge has ordered Uber not to use technology that a key executive downloaded before he left Waymo, the autonomous car company that was spun off from Google. But he refused to order a halt to Uber’s self-driving program, as requested by Waymo. Judge William Alsup in San Francisco says in the ruling filed Monday that Waymo has shown “compelling evidence” that a former star engineer named Anthony Levandowski downloaded thousands of confidential files before leaving Waymo. The Judge also says evidence shows that before he left Waymo, Levandowski and Uber planned for Uber to acquire a company formed by Levandowski. FILE- In this Dec. 13, 2016, file photo, Anthony Levandowski, head of Uber's self-driving program, speaks about their driverless car in San Francisco. In an order filed Monday, May 15, 2017, a federal judge ordered Uber to stop using technology that Levandowski downloaded before he left Waymo, the Alphabet Inc. autonomous car arm that was spun off from Google. The order filed Monday in a trade secrets theft lawsuit also forces Uber to return all downloaded materials. (AP Photo/Eric Risberg, File) Waymo sued Uber in February alleging that the ride-hailing company is using stolen self-driving technology to build its own fleet of autonomous cars. Monday’s ruling prevents Uber from using the technology on a laser navigational tool called Lidar that robotic cars use to see what’s around them. “The bottom line is the evidence indicates that Uber hired Levandowski even though it knew or should have known that he possessed over 14,000 confidential Waymo files,” Alsup wrote. “At least some information from those files, if not the files themselves, has seeped into Uber’s own Lidar development efforts.” Uber was ordered to return all downloaded materials to Waymo by noon on May 31. The decision was only a partial victory for Waymo, however. The company had sought to shut down Uber’s autonomous car program completely until the dispute is settled. But Alsup determined that Waymo’s patent infringement theories were too weak to support such an order. The judge ruled that although it’s hard to imagine that Levandowski “plundered Waymo’s vault the way he did” with no intent to use the material, Waymo still fell short of showing that the trade secrets were used. Numerous sections of the ruling were blacked out to protect those trade secrets. But the judge scolded Waymo for being “overbroad” in what it says are 121 trade secrets involved in the case. For example, Alsup wrote that Waymo can’t claim that the way it positions light sources in its Lidar is protected, since the design uses well-known principles of physics. “Waymo’s supposed trade secret is nothing more than Optics 101,” Alsup wrote. For that reason, Alsup wrote that even a limited injunction would be an unfair hardship for Uber’s Lidar development. Uber said in a statement Monday that it’s pleased the court allowed it to continue self-driving car research, including its own Lidar innovations. “We look forward to moving toward trial and continuing to demonstrate that our technology has been built independently from the ground up,” the statement said. Waymo, a unit of Google parent Alphabet Inc., said it welcomed the order stopping Uber from using “stolen documents containing trade secrets developed by Waymo through years of research.” Alsup also ordered Uber to remove Levandowski from any role in Lidar, and that it stop him from copying or otherwise using the downloaded materials. Levandowski formed Ottomotto, a self-driving vehicle startup, on Jan. 15, 2016. Twelve days later, he resigned from Waymo without giving any notice. The following August, Uber bought Ottomotto for $680 million and hired Levandowski to lead its self-driving car efforts. Last week Alsup took the rare step of referring the case to federal prosecutors for an investigation of possible criminal misconduct. The U.S. Attorney’s Office in San Francisco hasn’t responded to requests for comment. At stake is the direction of Uber’s self-driving car program, which its CEO has said is the key to the company’s future. Experts say prosecutors are likely to follow up on Alsup’s order and launch an investigation. The probe, combined with other legal and image woes, will likely reduce Uber’s value and in the worst case could threaten the San Francisco company’s existence if investors leave, criminal charges bring huge fines and legal action stalls autonomous car research, legal experts have said. Also Monday, Waymo confirmed that it is teaming up to test autonomous vehicles with Lyft, Uber’s main ride-hailing competitor, in a potential challenge to Uber.

Vanity Fair hive Sign In/Up business technology politics the players hwd movies television awards reviews vanities celebrity fashion beauty royals NEWSLETTER Video VF Store Magazine Search Business Politics Technology The Players Sign In/Up Car Wars Travis Kalanick’s $68 Billion Empire Could Be in Trouble Email Facebook Twitter SIGN UP FOR NEWSLETTER Car Wars Travis Kalanick’s $68 Billion Empire Could Be in Trouble Two of Uber’s biggest rivals just combined forces. by Maya KosoffMay 15, 2017 8:54 am Email Facebook Twitter By Ramin Talaie/The New York Times/Redux. For Uber C.E.O. Travis Kalanick, bringing a self-driving car to market before an army of Silicon Valley competitors isn’t just important—it’s existential. “What would happen if we weren’t a part of that future? If we weren’t part of the autonomy thing?” he mused in an interview last year. So Kalanick can’t be pleased that Waymo—the Google-owned autonomous-car company currently suing Uber for intellectual property theft—is also teaming up with Lyft, his biggest domestic rival, to develop self-driving cars. According to The New York Times, the two companies will work together on product development and pilot projects that could eventually see Lyft users hailing Waymo cars—a partnership that could prove devastating for Kalanick’s $68 billion empire if Waymo also succeeds in getting an injunction against Uber’s own driverless car initiative. (On Monday, California judge William Alsup issued a partial injunction, ruling that Anthony Levandowski, the Google-turned-Uber engineer at the heart of the lawsuit, could no longer work on any LIDAR-related projects at Uber, though the company can continue working on self-driving technology for now.) Both Waymo and Lyft confirmed the deal, but details seem a little unclear for the time being. “Waymo holds today’s best self-driving technology, and collaborating with them will accelerate our shared vision of improving lives with the world’s best transportation,” Lyft told the Times in a statement. “Lyft’s vision and commitment to improving the way cities move will help Waymo’s self-driving technology reach more people, in more places,” a Waymo spokeswoman said. The deal has been a long time in the making, the Times reports, with discussions dating back to last summer. But it’s not the first time that either company has sought out other strategic partnerships as the driverless-car industry rapidly evolves and consolidates in response to new competition. Lyft struck a deal in 2016 with General Motors, which bought self-driving start-up Cruise for $1 billion. Lyft’s partnership with GM is intended to leverage the network of users belonging to Lyft, a distant competitor to Uber in the U.S., eventually allowing them to hail rides in self-driving Chevrolet Bolt cars. Waymo, for its part, has a deal with Fiat Chrysler, working on self-driving minivans. The company has also talked to Honda about partnering on autonomous-vehicle projects. Both companies are also in competition with Tesla, which is looking at allowing users to eventually loan their cars out as part of a self-driving-taxi fleet, and Apple, which has begun testing its own autonomous tech on roads nearby its Cupertino campus. The Lyft-Waymo partnership is the latest blow to the already-fraught relationship between Uber and Google. Although Google Ventures is a major investor in Uber, having poured $250 million into the company years ago, Uber has expressed few qualms about poaching Google employees. In 2015, former Googler Rachel Whetstone was hired as Uber’s S.V.P. of policy and communication, replacing David Plouffe, and she took with her a whole group of Google employees to staff Uber’s communications team. Uber also acqui-hired Levandowski and his self-driving trucking start-up, Otto, just months after he left Google. (Levandowski is now at the epicenter of the Waymo-Uber lawsuit, with Google accusing him of stealing proprietary technology when he left. Levandowski has denied any wrongdoing. “Waymo’s injunction motion is a misfire: there is no evidence that any of the 14,000 files in question ever touched Uber’s servers and Waymo’s assertion that our multi-lens LIDAR is the same as their single-lens LIDAR is clearly false,” Uber associate general counsel Angela Padilla said in a statement last month. “If Waymo genuinely thought that Uber was using its secrets, it would not have waited more than five months to seek an injunction. Waymo doesn’t meet the high bar for an injunction, which would stifle our independent innovation—probably Waymo’s goal in the first place.”) Google Ventures executive David Drummond left Uber’s board earlier this year, as Kalanick was reportedly concerned about mounting self-driving competition between Uber and Google.

[Deal Alert] Get a free official case when you buy a Pixel XL from the Google Store Richard Gao Follow View All Posts 2017/05/14 8:30am PDTMay 14, 2017 11 Plus 1 on G+ 51 Share on Facebook 44 Share on Twitter Total Shares106 Deals Google News Pixel XL It's been a couple of months since the Pixel and Pixel XL debuted, but it's still rare to come across a deal for them, especially on the XL model. In fact, we've posted a total of zero Deal Alerts on the non-Verizon Pixel XL. However, Google itself has decided to offer a free official case to anyone who purchases the Pixel XL from the Google Store. It's pretty simple: add any color/storage level of Pixel XL to your cart, then add either the $30 clear case or the $35 silicone case (your choice of color) to your cart. In your cart, you'll see the 'Buy Pixel XL, receive a Pixel XL Case by Google on us' text, along with a discount of either $30 or $35, depending on which case you got. Unfortunately, this doesn't work on any Live Cases, the LifeProof FRE, or the Otterbox Defender. Want to get in on this deal? Google simply says that the offer will be 'available while supplies last' from when it began at 12am PT today (May 14th). So if you've been eyeing a Pixel XL and a case, but were waiting for some sort of little incentive, now may be the time to pull the trigger.

Google simply says that the offer will be 'available while supplies last" I'm pretty sure they mean while supplies of the phone lasts... Because they'll be out of stock again long before this offer ends. irtechneo Lol yep. Their inventory issues are mind boggling. I finally gave up trying to get one and went with S8+. Glad I did. Andrea Bittau I want to do the same but s8 ( normal )... how is bixby button ? useless ?! :/ irtechneo Bixby button is great! I use the app called bxActions and re-map it to the Google app. I now have a dedicated button for Google. Fantastic. Bixby itself is garbage (IMO). Michael Hannigan Don't. G6 is a better deal and a better phone. And I am a Samsung fanboy/fanman. Michael Hannigan Yeah, great move. Except the Pixel is a much better device. irtechneo In your​ opinion that may be true. Not in mine. I honestly don't like anything about the pixel hardware..I think it is one of the ugliest phones I have ever seen. The software experience can't be beat but that isn't all I factor into my purchasing decisions. Michael Hannigan You are right when you say that the overall experience cannot be beat. Michael Hannigan Ouch, ouch! shamatuu I can buy a laptop with that price longer with 769 bucks Cowboydroid You could get a used Pixel laptop for about half that price. Mix My laptop with a GTX 1050, 8gb of ram and an i7 quad core processor was cheaper than my 128gb PIxel XL, Canadian............. Never again. TechGuy22 So expensive Thanks to my 6p I got to buy the xl 128 gb only for 300 bucks. Kyle Null If you don't NEED a phone right now, you really shouldn't​ buy the Pixel. Wait for the Pixel 2 or something better. EowynCarter Yeah, I think that even if google where to finally make the pixel available in France, I would wait. I just hope google get their act together and actually do a worldwide release and my nexus 6 don't suffer some sudden death. Tk JunkMail My Nexus 6 is running Android 7 and Google Fi and is as fast as ever. No reason to replace it. EowynCarter Mine sometimes get laggy. Plus, no Android O. :( That's a shame. Michael Hannigan Google, like the rest of the world, really doesn't care about France. Sean O’Connor Problem is that waiting is what got me into this situation in the first place. I didn't buy a 6P last summer since the Pixel​ was around the corner, and I've only started seeing the model I want available within the past few weeks. I could wait again, but by the time I'm lucky enough to see the Pixel 2 I want in stock on the play store people will be talking about the Pixel 3. There is always some better device to wait for, but at a certain point I just need to get a new phone. Kyle Null I'm​ still using the Nexus 5 because I'm waiting for Google to release a reasonably priced device. At this rate, I might still be using the Nexus 5 in 2030. Vinayak Prabhu I was in the same boat, but finally jumped on to the S8+ Michael Hannigan Ouch! Andy I was in same boat. I ended up getting a moto z play. Its amazing for the price. I'll get the pixel 2 in the fall. Michael Hannigan It's a piece of crap, but a good piece of crap for the price. You seem to be one of the few reasonable peeps here. Michael Hannigan True dat, hookah. You hit da nail on da head. Tk JunkMail The Nexus 6 is running Android 7 and Google Fi and is as fast as ever. No reason to replace it. Cowboydroid My Nexus 6 was slow even on marshmallow. It was almost unusable on 7. Had to root and revert back. john gregson No more Google. 6P very poor for a person who deals with emotionally distressed clients. 8 hours maximum juice. Michael Hannigan Maybe you need to get better clients. Duder12 That shit battery life was a Qualcomm issue not a Google issue. Michael Hannigan You should have done a factory reset. That would have fixed it. Cowboydroid I did multiple resets. Michael Hannigan Ok, finally! Good. It's probably all set, then. You're welcome. Cowboydroid Mmmmm. Michael Hannigan But the Nexus 6 was/is a great phone. One of the best, if not the best, Nexus made. Alex Higgins The clear cases should have been free from the outset... Broke in me 3 months in. I'd pass on even the free one and opt for an awesome one on Amazon for half the price. Can't vouch for the silicone ones. Michael Hannigan "...pass on the free one"? Didn't think about that too long before blurting it out, did you? Alex Higgins Didn't have to. Had one, wasn't worth $30, isn't worth having even if it's free. Phone's great, though. Michael Hannigan That doesn't make sense. Alex Higgins Obviously, given the rest of your comments, you're offended by anyone with an opinion different from yours. So, in the interest of offending you further, I'll reply again. It makes sense if I want my phone to be protected. That clear case actually scratched my phone on the corners. So, yeah. Makes plenty of sense to me. Free != Good. Michael Hannigan I'm afraid you have overestimated my concern. Nothing in a comment section an online forum could offend me. I can't really be offended by people who don't know me. But to be realistic, I would suggest you just accept the free gift - since refusing it would either mean not getting your phone at all or delaying your shipment while you try to explain how you want it shipped in a special way from everyone else - without the free case. Idiotic. I guess I am a little offended by your stupidity, but not in a personal way. Bobby R. Blair Don't be offended by stupidity. Stupid can't be fixed. One of my pet peaves is ignorance. Ignorance is a choice. Now that does offend me. jamaniek LOL, 769$ still. Google is ridiculous with the pricing. M6 That's not ridiculous. If they have such limited stock and can't keep up with existing orders (granted that's their fault, they're missing out on a lot of demand), why drop the price? It would be ridiculous to drop the price at this point before they can at least fulfill existing orders jamaniek Considering people that already placed their orders and didn't receive them yet- yes I see your point and I agree. But other than that the price is way too high by today's standards. We've got better and faster phones at that price and as fast ones at lower prices. Pixel is probably still one of the best phones (if not the best) when it comes to pure user experience, but I don't think that this factor alone justifies spending this much on it. Richard Gozinya I dont think its that ridicules when its put in context, How much is a Iphone 7, a Samsung S7 edge, S8+ all about the same jamaniek iPhone 7 Plus costs 718$ on Amazon for 128GB option, S7 Edge costs 515$ and OP3T goes for 439$. S8+ is a completely different story, as it is a new, faster phone. May be overpriced, but still... Bruce It was ridiculously overpriced when it launched. Today it's laughable. Google wants to charge Apple prices without the associated services. Apple supports their phones for 4-5 years. Google guarantees OS updates for 18 months. Apple has stores you can walk in and get any problems fixed. Google finger points and doesn't accept blame with all the hardware problems. On a hardware level, the iPhones themselves have far fewer problems. Even if Google were to acknowledge a hardware problem, it doesn't have enough phones in stock to offer a replacement. One could simply swap out a problematic iPhone in a store. I would never buy an iPhone, but Apple service is deservedly legendary. I know anyone can have isolated anecdotes on either side, but I doubt anyone can argue about Apple's service. If I have to buy a used XL, I have no idea if the phone has a problem with the speaker or Bluetooth or call volume. Guess what that does the resale value. Google has got a long way to go before they should even dare to charge $870 for a 128GB XL. The Nexus 6P and the Nexus 5 were priced appropriately for the service provided by Google. Anything over $500, is overpriced for a phone from Google. Duder12 How do you not get that it was a marketing move? The price says it's competition to the iPhone. Had they launched the pixel 1 at a lower price it would have never recovered. Duder12 You don't. We do. Elsiedamado Google is paying 97$ per hour! Work for few hours & have longer with friends and family! !sg84c: On tuesday I got a great new Land Rover Range Rover from having earned $8752 this last four weeks..

Cai Copley The price is crazy because due it's bland design, lack of innovation, lack of customer service, the fact updates may not extend beyond two years, no stores to buy from. Apple charges those prices because of the customer service, constant updates for 4+ years, etc so they have the cash flux to provide for that—people would rather pay a one time high price than continually pay a subscription service! Michael Hannigan I would rather continually pay for a subscription service, assuming it carries a substantial value. charlie Jason That case makes it look even more like an iPhone. Just saying. NooSH should be [Rape alert]* Margaritas Ante Porcos Is it obligatory here to say only nice things about that crap of a phone? because I have nothing but a middle finger to to this ugly overpriced underachiever. Gerardo Sarabia I don't love the design and it's far from perfect but it's still the best phone I've ever used. Michael Hannigan So you weren't able to get on, were you? Duder12 Best phone I've ever owned. putte40 If that phone could be available worldwide.... Marty Meh...I'd rather have either a Spigen or Supcase. Cowboydroid Both are massively overpriced. I'm curious to see sales stats. Me Are the cases backordered as well? matteventu Nobody wants their crappy cases. ro964 I entertained a Pixel XL purchase at one point, but never ever found stock available, save for one brief moment while speaking directly with a Project Fi customer service rep. Over time, my interest has evaporated. Today I'm using a Nexus 5X ($249) which is running Android 7.1.2 and costs me about $35/month on Project Fi. I'll take a look at the Pixel 2 whenever it's announced. If the features are what I'm looking for, maybe my interest will be renewed. For now, I'm happy with my N5X. seattle tech HAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHA RXG9 Google still charing $769? lol. I just got 2 Galaxy S8's for $750. (T-Mobile BOGO deal) Michael Hannigan Read the fine print, chump! Duder12 No kidding. Dumbass just locked himself into TMobile Luiz Marin After I got one for $15 on eBay to my pixel, I just in love with the silicone touch of it, Totally worth it Mako10 Google should stick to software, both of my nexus phones have been a joke. And with all the complaints about the pixel, they still cant get it right...and for $800 no less. Sorry but my next phone will either be a S8 or Note, or more likely an iphone. never thought id say the "i" word, but their stuff just works. Michael Hannigan It's been "a couple of months since the Pixel and Pixel XL debited"? Really? For me it's been over six months. LethalLunatic Probably does not understand the definition of "couple" Mark Conroy It's never even appeared on the Play store in Ireland, so no danger of it being overpriced in a country where Google have an enormous financial presence. Lindsay Meyer I have a Pixel, which was fortunately (or unfortunately) rather easy for me to acquire. But after reading about everyone who's been wanting one and can't get it, I would really like to say... Please, take mine. I would love my $800 back so I could go buy the Nexus 6 and spend the remaining 300 bucks on something else. Lots of cool stuff out there for $300. My husband has the Nexus 6, and let me tell you, it's very nearly the same damn phone as far as user experience is concerned. The Pixel is maybe like a $50 upgrade; I wouldn't pay more. Please don't let scarcity be the reason to try and get your hands on the Pixel, free case or not. You've been warned. Mix Petty much this! My wifes ZTE Axon 7 was 1/2 the price and has had less issues than my Pixel XL's have (I am on my 3rd one) My brother has had his Pixel XL for less than 4 months and he is already selling it. Not worth $1,340 CAD....not even close. Duder12 Yeah well same can't be said with last year's Nexus 6p and Nexus 5x. The Qualcomm processor in those phones make them an immediate no compared to the pixel.

Google said Monday that Audi and Volvo plan to incorporate a version of its Android operating system into future vehicles that will help drivers and passengers control features like car radios and air conditioning. Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter. Google said the new Android OS would also be compatible with apps like Google Maps and music streaming service Spotify. Additionally, people will be able to use Google’s voice-activated assistant, Google Assistant, to do things like scout for nearby restaurants while driving.

We like this definition. Fast-Track Summit attendees engaged in an open dialogue and learned from top executives at LUMA Partners, Google, SPANX and more Atlanta, GA (PRWEB) May 15, 2017 Atlanta-based direct and digital agency BKV welcomed over 120 senior marketing executives to the Porsche Experience Center in Atlanta for a day of learning how marketers can best adapt to the speed of change in today’s overwhelming media and marketing landscape. “Change is inevitable in our industry like death and taxes, but it can be exciting,” said Maribett Varner, President of BKV. “Marketers face a myriad of challenges from technology to media, but identifying how to talk to the consumer remains one of the biggest challenges we face.” The invitation only Fast-Track Summit provided insights on disrupting the digital landscape from Google and Snapchat’s investment bank, led by Gayle Meyers, CMO of Luma Partners, reducing friction on the mobile channel from Google’s performance director Tim Reis, and optimizing customer experience from SPANX Vice President of Ecommerce Christa DePoe. Attending executives also shared their success stories, current challenges, and engaged in a collaborative and intimate gathering to develop strategies for optimizing revenue. Tim Reis, Director of Performance Agencies for Google, spoke on the importance of speed in today’s mobile retail environment. Consumers now spend 25% of media consumption via mobile and touch their phones on average 2,617 times per day. “We have to provide a frictionless experience for consumers today, as two-thirds of in-store purchases are influenced by digital,” said Reis. When asked about how marketers in attendance are adapting to today’s changing landscape, the answers varied. “The experience for consumers can either be fractured or you can think about making it seamless and tracking it in that way,” said Michael Bald, Managing Partner of Optimal Brands. “The biggest challenge for us is keeping pace with customer expectations and making sure that we aren’t a necessary evil for customers, but something they actually want,” said Michael West, VP of Communications at Avangrid, a diversified electric and natural gas utility company. Attendees also had the opportunity to get in the fast track mindset by exploring the best that German engineering has to offer at the Porsche Experience Center and feel the thrill of high speed racing on the Porsche Test Track. The precision and speed required to successfully navigate the course served as the perfect analogy for what is required to rise up to the changing media and consumer demand landscape and claim the checkered flag.

And now it’s cracking down on anyone who has rooted or unlocked their Android device. Which is annoying. Netflix Is Incompatible With This Device As first spotted by Android Police, the Netflix app on the Google Play Store is now showing as “incompatible” with rooted and unlocked devices. This is, according to the company, all thanks to Netflix switching over to using the Widevine DRM (Digital Rights Management What Is DRM & Why Does It Exist If It's So Evil?

Given that Widevine is owned and operated by Google, it’s no surprise that apps utilizing Widevine aren’t made available to Android devices that haven’t been certified by Google. However, even people whose phones have shipped with unlocked bootloaders are being affected. Netflix issued a statement saying: “With our latest 5.0 release, we now fully rely on the Widevine DRM provided by Google; therefore, many devices that are not Google-certified or have been altered will no longer work with our latest app and those users will no longer see the Netflix app in the Play Store.” Thankfully, for anyone with a rooted or unlocked device now judged to be “incompatible”, there is a simple alternative to downloading Netflix from the Google Play Store.

Google is building full-on Android for the car with Volvo and Audi Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/15 9:33am PDTMay 15, 2017 15 Plus 1 on G+ 78 Share on Facebook 50 Share on Twitter Total Shares143 Android Auto Android OS Google News Today Google has revealed more info on their new standalone Android platform for cars. Unlike Android Auto, which just casts info from your phone onto whatever software your vehicle maker has tossed together, the new system is based on Android and brings some of the same tools Android Auto had natively. Google revealed this initiative at last year's I/O, but there hasn't been much news apart from Chrysler's concept back at CES. Both Audi and Volvo will be making use of the new systems in future vehicles. Both Volvo and Audi appear to have been given a lot of leeway with the UI in the screenshots on Google's blog, things look to be skinned pretty heavily. If Google is allowing car makers that degree of flexibility, I wouldn't expect too much in the way of material design love when it lands in more cars. Even so, more tools and features from Android making their way into your car could come in handy, OEM-skin or not. Not to mention the utility of having some of the same features you did before via Auto without needing your phone around. Google revealed last year that they were thinking about the potential of bringing full Android to cars and showed off a prototype Maserati modified to run the experimental software at last year's I/O (Maserati was not involved, Google and Qualcomm shoehorned the tech into a car on their own). Google has been quiet since then about any news related to the new initiative, or any new names for the program. Given how close this is to I/O there is a good chance we'll hear more at Google's event. Source: Google Tags Android android auto audi cars vehicles volvo subscribe ...

JD In one of the security updates it'll stop my Exhaust from exhausting outside and instead in to the cabin. Don't worry tho it goes away after a reboot and doesn't affect all models. George Google's motto: let's abandon an OS/app/service before it becomes too popular by starting from scratch with another OS/app/service... TechGuy22 LOL you're going to have a ball at this year I/0 since so many shit going to be announced that will get killed off after 6 months George bro, it's been like that EVERY year... get wit the program lol makapav It really took form last year. Spaces, Allo, Duo. That was a whole bucket list. Dennis Ulijn I have a feeling Spaces was made just because they needed some centralized message board idea for I/O. Just in time for I/O and google never looked back... Months later when another app was coming out with the Spaces name they found out it was still alive. Drakenoid Spaces was pretty good, though now we've moved to Classroom and pretty sure it won't get shuttered because schools. Ryne Hager I gotta say this here, since I can't elsewhere. But, I used to think you were just a entertaining mild troll, but given your comments elsewhere I have come to see that you are the entertaining mild troll we need. Keep it up. Kawshik Ahmed At least in this Android never had a official 'Standalone In-Vehicle Infotainment' like QNX and Tizen. There are some unofficial attemps like Hyundai uses Android 2.3 and Honda uses Android4.2 in their car IVI. But this will much safer because Google is working with them. Shining Wing So what happens when the car stops receiving updates? One of the main reasons for Auto using your phone was that you only needed to worry about your phone and app being up-to-date, and phones are a lot more replaceable than cars when the updates stop. Kawshik Ahmed Do you know Hyundai Sonata cars run on Android 2.3 !!!!!! and Honda cars run on Android 4.2 ?? People don't panic about this cars because they don't know they are running Android and not just any Android very very old version of Android but those cars are all fine. Specialized OS's don't need updates. Aaron Anything that connects to the internet needs to be updated, at least for security purposes. And these systems will have to be connected at some level for Maps updates and messages. instinct Yes, people don't care because that's the norm. However, if in 2027 you are running a car with a ten year old OS and someone else is running a current OS, people may start to care. The big problem I see right now is that Android Auto now doesn't really seem to have any aftermarket products with really good screens. Ryne Hager That is an excellent question. I hope we get more info at I/O. syxbit When I bought my last TV, I deliberately got one without Android TV, because of the pathetic updates. I just purchased a Shield. I'm happy to buy a new Shield TV every 2-3 years, but I'm expecting my TV to last 5+ years. This is exactly what I'll do with my next car purchase. I'd rather the car just support the old Android Auto, so I can keep getting new phones every 1-2 years. I will never purchase a car with Android built in unless there's a clear promise of updates for MANY years. Ryne Hager I very much agree. Wait till you see my "What we use" post. I have a feeling you're gonna love it. marcusmarcus2 How often are the infotainment systems in cars updated now? If "Project Treble" comes into fruition, then it could actually improve infotainment system updates compared to current ones. Sean Leckie XDA? :) Suyash Bansal Maybe they could use the new update mechanism they are talking about Android O which makes it easier for manufacturers to update device. h4rr4r That will never get updated. The car should just display the phone screen. Jon Fridman I was going to buy a Volvo XC60 later this year, hopefully AA integration will work better than some other cars. It won't be the new version like they're working on, but at least it'll be there. Alexey Vasilyev I have Volvo XC60 MY14 running Sensus Connected Touch (Android 2.3). UI is very fluid. But I got a lot of problems. First Volvo want 400 EUR per year to keep iGO maps updated. I made a root and installed Waze - it works very good. But 3 years have passed (not a lot for cars) and now some features are not working. For example Liveradio app (which is just a list of radio URLs) is not working anymore - server shutdown. I think the best way for such systems is to use Mirrorlink. At least you can keep apps updated. JD Wooo Now I gotta get a new car every 2 years Bru [971] That's funny. Audi was reticent to add Android Auto support to it's cars Deeco "Car has unexpectedly stopped working" icyhotmike I bought a headunit with Dual bluetooth pairing, HD, Spotify, I Heart Radio, Pandora, every damn app.. built into it... for $99 (Kenwood KMM-BT318U) It even has an "Android" mode (no idea what it does) So don't waste your money Volvo and Audi Suyash Bansal That's not Android Auto. It's Android Open Accessory protocol (AOA) that lets you control phone-based content icyhotmike I got android auto app on my phone. marcusmarcus2 This would hav ebeen good news a couple years ago when I was hoping for my Nexus Lexus...Pixel ruined that dream. boop Auto may be the only extension of Android that Google's handled well. By making it an app it's not dependent on either the car or the phone for updates, you don't even need to buy a new car or head unit as you can just run it on your phone and, working under the assumption that this is built on O with Treble, updating the car itself shouldn't even be an issue (unlike all the Android TVs stuck on Marshmallow and the Watches still waiting on Wear 2.0). Paul Lemelin Harley needs to go in this direction and I don't care if it's an Android or iOS solution because their Harmon Kardon Infotainment system is the absolute WORST! Shahin iPhone users be like, "will it also come with lag, malware and inconsistent updates?" Suyash Bansal At least it'll work better compared to Apple's Carplay 😂 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeESbGPl_Dw Harsh patil Does this mean a slow death to Android Auto from now until such OS is lanuched? JG Tesla should be involved with this. They already have a big tablet installed front and center. And, from what I heard, Tesla had approached Google in regards to potentially using Android for their system. Google informed them Android wasn't, then, ready to be used in cars. But obviously now... It would allow Tesla to quickly add more apps available. Then you could use any music streaming service, without having to wait for Tesla to build the app for their platform.

Don't Click That Fake WhatsApp Link Just don't. OK, here's the deal: We've been screwing up lately. First there was the massive Google Docs hack that spread like wildfire thanks to people clicking shady links, and then a ransomware attack tore around the world for the same reason. Now, someone is trying to get WhatsApp users to install some grody software by getting them to click a fake link. The trick was spotted by a Reddit user on Sunday night. The fake URL looks like the real WhatsApp website (www.whatsapp.com), but it's spelled with cyrillic letters. (It's not the first time hackers have tried this trick.) Once you click, you're redirected to another site that asks you to download a sketchy Chrome extension that looks like some nasty adware. The Chrome store entry for the extension now 404s, and a Google spokesperson confirmed to Motherboard in an email that Google removed the extension from the store. Now that you know the score, this is where it all stops, alright? Do not click that link, for the love of all that is holy. Do. Not. Click. That. Link. If you are nonetheless tempted, here are some ways that you can make sure you're not getting tricked, in this case or any other time. First, ensure that the URL you're visiting is spelled the same way as the real product or company. This was a dead giveaway for the fake WhatsApp URL. Also, many legitimate companies secure your web connection with HTTPS encryption, so check that it's in use when you visit a site you suspect of being illegitimate (in Chrome, it's a green "HTTPS" indicator before the URL). Be safe out there. Subscribe to Science Solved It , Motherboard's new show about the greatest mysteries that were solved by science. Update: Google confirmed that the company removed the adware from the Chrome store. This article has been updated with that information.

Over 200 private companies using AI algorithms across different verticals have been acquired since 2012, with over 30 acquisitions taking place in Q1’17 alone (as of 3/24/17). This quarter also saw one of the largest M&A deals: Ford’s acquisition of Argo AI for $1B. In 2013, Google picked up deep learning and neural network  startup DNN research from the computer science department at the University of Toronto. This acquisition reportedly helped Google make major upgrades to its image search feature. In 2014 Google acquired British company DeepMind Technologies for some $600M (Google’s DeepMind program recently beat a human world champion in the board game “Go”). Last year, it acquired visual search startup Moodstock, and bot platform Api.ai. More recently, in Q1’17, Google acquired predictive analytics platform Kaggle. Apple has been ramping up its M&A activity, and ranked second with a total of 7 acquisitions. It recently acquired Tel Aviv-based RealFace, valued at $2M. Intel, Microsoft, and Facebook are tied for third place. Intel acquired 3 startups in 2016 alone: Itseez, Nervana Systems, and Movidius, while Facebook acquired Belarus-based Masquerade Technologies and Switzerland-based Zurich ye recently. Microsoft recently acquired Genee and conversational AI startup Maluuba.   Twitter is the next most-active acquirer, with 4 major acquisitions, the most recent being image-processing startup Magic Pony. Salesforce, which joined the race in 2015 with the acquisition of Tempo AI, made two major acquisitions last year: Khosla Ventures-backed MetaMind and open-source machine-learning server PredictionIO. GE made 2 acquisitions in November 2016: AI-IoT startup Bit Stew Systems, and CRM-focused Wise.io.

Baig , USA TODAY 2:03 p.m. ET May 15, 2017 261 Shares Google Pixel  (Photo: Robert Deutsch, USAT) When Google hosts its annual I/O developer conference in Mountain View, Calif. on Wednesday, you can expect to hear more about Android O, the next version of the operating system software that fuels the overwhelming majority of smartphones around the world, including Google’s own Pixel flagship devices. But you'll probably have to wait on new Pixels, whose current models were released at a separate event in October. Those phones, the Pixel with a 5-inch display— listed at the Google Play Store as out of stock—and the Pixel XL with a 5.5-inch display, were generally met with positive reviews when they launched, in part as a showcase for the Google Assistant. They haven't sold well. According to the Strategy Analytics market intelligence and consulting firm, Google Pixel captured just 1.1% share of the U.S. smartphone market through the first three months of 2017, tumbling from 1.7% in the previous quarter. Neil Mawston, the executive director for Wireless Device Strategies at Strategy Analytics, pins the struggles in the U.S. and overseas on issues relating to retail distribution, availability shortages and delivery delays. Among other recommendations for new Pixels, Mawston believes Google needs to “pretty up” the hardware. Analyst Avi Greengart, research director, for Platforms & Devices at GlobalData, would also like to see design improvements, starting with the trend towards narrower bezels like those seen on the LG G6 and Samsung Galaxy S8, and that Apple may implement in a tenth anniversary iPhone. Greengart also wants to see Google, “defend its imaging prowess against whatever improvements Apple is likely making to the next iPhone.” But the most important thing Google can do to bolster Pixel sales, Greengart suggests, “would be to sell it through all U.S. carrier retailers and make enough of them to keep them in stock.” While Google is keeping mum on the prospects of showcasing Pixels in a couple of days, Google senior vice president for hardware Rick Osterloh told Android Pit during Mobile World Congress a few months back that Google would indeed be bringing out premium phones this year, suggesting at the time that there’s an “annual rhythm” to when these devices get released.

Well, according to Android Police, Google does plan to bring Google Assistant to iOS. It will reportedly launch the assistant on Apple's mobile platform as a standalone app, just like Microsoft did with Cortana. And the announcement will likely be made at Google's I/O developers conference this week. Check out Pocket-lint's I/O guide to see what else may be announced at this year's event. Google's new Assistant app might offer a "chat" style functionality, Android Police claimed, which reminds us of how Google Assistant is currently available in the Google Allo app. There aren't many details available at this time, but apparently, Google Assistant for iOS will only be available in the US at launch. Keep in mind the Google Assistant SDK was only opened up to developers last month. Forget Bitmoji: Allo uses neural networks to personalise emoji Google Fuchsia OS: What's the story so far? Google Home review: A better voice assistant than Amazon Echo? By launching an app for iOS, Google will give developers more incentive to work with Google Assistant. Also, Google has a history of launching many of its services on iOS, because it cares about getting those services out to as many people as possible. By bringing Google Assistant to iPhone users, it will also be opening the door for wider Google Home adoption with Apple customers. We'll keep you posted as we learn more.

With Google launching Assistant’s SDK last month, making the announcement at a conference full of developers makes sense. It’s possible the app will be a hybrid between the chat-style interaction in Google Allo and the voice-controlled interaction in the Android OS. Other than that, there are few details at this point. It’s apparently known for certain the app will only be available in the US when it launches, which would not be all that surprising considering the Android version is only available in a limited number of regions.

One of which is being able to implement policy actions at the page level. Previously, violations of Google’s AdSense policies would result in ads being pulled from an entire site. Now, Google will only be removing ads from the specific pages containing AdSense violations. This will lead to fewer disruptions for publishers who rely on AdSense income. The company says this policy change will allow it to act more quickly when it needs to remove ads from a publisher’s site. Site-level actions will still be used when needed, Google says. Repeated violations could still lead to being terminated from the AdSense program. If an ad gets removed from your site and you wan’t to know why, Google has developed a new communication channel for that. There’s a new Policy Center for AdSense publishers which will house everything a publisher needs to know about policy violations. The Policy Center will identify where the violation was found, and provide a set of step-by-step instructions for resolving the issue. Afterward, you can use the Policy Center to notify Google when your pages are ready for review. The new Policy Center is said to be rolling out in a few weeks and is among the top requests for new features from AdSense publishers. Google says other Policy Centers like this one will be rolled out for other publisher platforms later this year.

Google Evan Selleck Contributing Editor | May 15, 2017 0 shares 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0               Recently, Google unveiled a new feature for one of its messaging apps, Allo, that allows users to create animated cartoon stickers of themselves. It's a very Google solution to what other apps make really simple, but the end result is actually pretty interesting. Using a selfie you take, Allo will scan the image, use machine learning and a neural network to rework the image, and then present a sticker pack based on the artwork from artist Lamar Abrams. It's an in-depth approach, and very Google, but the results are certainly interesting and eye catching. What's more, Allo users can use that digital representation of themselves in conversations to really spice things up. But it's this feature that has me asking the most obvious question: Are you using Google Allo? I put Google Allo on my phone as soon as it became available, mostly because I wanted to try out Google Assistant. I have a few different messaging apps on my phone, but I'll be perfectly honest with you here, I never intended to ask anyone I regularly talk to to adopt Allo. Mostly because there's nothing wrong with the other apps I'm already using, and, at the time, Allo didn't really feature anything that would make me, or them, want to switch. As far as I can tell that really hasn't changed. And for iOS users it will probably never change? Well, not unless Apple changes the way that applications can be designated a default app. But on Android, I think Allo might just be a matter of time for some folks. For those who want to use Allo, it might just come down to the fact that it simply doesn't allow for SMS integration yet. That's what I've been waiting for, anyway. I imagine that Google is working on it, or at least plans on working on it to eventually release that feature, and maybe it comes Android Messages with it, too. But until then Allo just doesn't feel like an app that will find its way to my daily routine in any capacity. What about you, though? Are you using Google Allo on a regular basis? Have you convinced those you speak to to switch to the messaging app? Or are you waiting for that oft-requested SMS integration before you make it your default app? Let me know!

Tech blog Gizmodo recently conducted an experiment intended to find out how easy it would be to phish members of President Donald Trump's administration. Gizmodo's "Special Projects Desk" sent emails to 15 members of the Trump administration that looked as though they came from someone the recipient knew. Targets included informal presidential advisor Newt Gingrich, former FBI director James Comey, cybersecurity advisor Rudy Giuliani, FCC chairman Ajit Pai, White House press secretary Sean Spicer, and White House advisor Perter Thiel, among others. "We sent them an email that mimicked an invitation to view a spreadsheet in Google Docs," Gizmodo explained. "The emails came from the address security.test@gizmodomedia.com, but the sender name each one displayed was that of someone who might plausibly email the recipient, such as a colleague, friend, or family member." A link in the message took people to what looked like a Google sign-in page asking them to enter their Google credentials. Gizmodo said the URL of the page included the word "test" and the page "was not set up to actually record or retain the text of their passwords, just to register who had attempted to submit login information." Eight different devices visited the bogus site, but it's impossible to know whether the recipients themselves clicked the link, or forwarded the message to IT specialists who did, Gizmodo said. Two of the targets – Gingrich and Comey — replied to the message questioning its validity; no one entered their passwords. Related Trump Signs Executive Order on Cybersecurity Trump Signs Executive Order on Cybersecurity A careful observer would have been able to tell that the message was bogus. The fake Google sign-in page included a message at the bottom saying it was "built by Gizmodo Media Group to test your digital security acumen." If you're sitting there wondering if this experiment was even legal, you're not the only one. According to Ars Technica, the test may have violated several federal, state, and local laws. "At a minimum, Gizmodo danced along the edges of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA)," the site argues, pointing to the fact that Gizmodo ignored "many of the restrictions usually placed on similar tests by penetration-testing and security firms." The Executive Editor of Gizmodo's Special Projects Desk, John Cook, said his team took precautions to stay within the law.

Click to Skip Ad Closing in... Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Apps & Software If you’re a hardcore Android fan, Netflix might be blocked from your phone Jacob Siegal @JacobSiegal May 15th, 2017 at 12:59 PM Share Tweet There are plenty of good reasons to root your Android phone or tablet, from removing pre-installed bloatware to speeding up your device, but Netflix just made the decision a bit more difficult. Over the weekend, Netflix stopped appearing in search results on the Play Store for Android users with rooted and unlocked devices. Visiting the listing directly showed the following error message as well: “Your device isn’t compatible with this version.” On Saturday, Netflix confirmed to Android Police that it had begun blocking rooted and unlocked devices (basically any device that isn’t Google-certified) from being able to download its mobile app. Don't Miss: New ‘Legend of Zelda’ game reportedly coming to iPhone and Android This is the statement that Netflix provided to Android Police regarding the block: With our latest 5.0 release, we now fully rely on the Widevine DRM provided by Google; therefore, many devices that are not Google-certified or have been altered will no longer work with our latest app and those users will no longer see the Netflix app in the Play Store. This change is reflected in the change log of the latest update for the Netflix app, confirming that “Version 5.0 only works with devices that are certified by Google and meet all Android requirements.” This means that for the time being, hardcore Android users who are savvy enough to take device customization to the next level will not be able to download the app from the Play store. Oddly, though the Play Store listing is blocked for rooted devices, the app itself seems to be functioning normally (for now). So if you already have the app on your rooted or unlocked device, you can still access the streaming service (providing you have an account). Android Police also points out that you can download the latest Netflix APK from Pushbullet, since the Play Store listing is inaccessible.

Does the search giant have enough firepower to overtake Amazon? We'll find out this week at Google I/O. Smart Home by Richard Nieva May 15, 2017 6:00 AM PDT @richardjnieva Enlarge Image This week, Google is expected to reveal what's next for its Google Home and Assistant. Taylor Martin/CNET A few days before Google CEO Sundar Pichai stepped on stage at the 2016 I/O developer conference, he told me about the Assistant, a digital helper that could do things for you like play a song, give you flight information or tell you what's on your calendar. Pichai also gave credit where credit was due. One of the devices the Assistant would inhabit is Google Home, a smart speaker that aims to capitalize on the success of the Amazon Echo. "There are areas where we will be ahead," Pichai said of following Amazon to the market. "And there will be areas where someone points a way and we do it." On Wednesday, Pichai returns to Shoreline Amphitheater -- basically Google's backyard in Mountain View, California -- almost a year after introducing the world to the Assistant and Google Home. He's expected to talk about a range of things including virtual reality and Android, Google's mobile operating system at Google I/O. And he's also due to give us an update on the Assistant, a rival to Amazon's Alexa voice assistant, Apple's Siri and Microsoft's Cortana. It might not make any difference to you whether you're barking orders at a device made by Google or Amazon, just as long as it gives you an accurate weather report or reads out the top headlines of the hour. But the stakes are high for tech companies looking to take over your living room. Home is where you binge on TV and movies, get ready for work, eat, cook, sleep and shop online. All of that activity is potentially data that tech giants including Google and Amazon want to get their hands on. The better they know you, the more they'll (eventually) be able to woo advertisers or get you to buy things. It's not like we don't have any options. Right now, Google is a distant second in the smart speaker market. So far, people overwhelmingly have picked the Amazon Echo, introduced in 2014, as the smart home hub of choice, according to research firm eMarketer. In the US, of the 35.6 million people who use a voice-enabled speaker once a month, more than 70 percent use a product from the Echo line, which has several variations, including the $150 original Echo and $50 Echo Dot. Google Home, which right now sells for $115, has almost 24 percent. Google declined to comment. An Amazon spokeswoman said it's "great to see people excited" about smart home hubs. 18 Here's everything the Google Home can do 'Pressure on Google' Competition is only going to get more fierce. Last week, Amazon introduced its latest Echo product, the $230 Echo Show, which includes a screen for video calling. Microsoft is also bringing its Cortana digital assistant software to smart speakers, partnering with manufacturers including Samsung's Harman Kardon, Intel and HP. That means for Google, the clock is ticking. Once people bring a smart speaker like the Echo into their house, they're unlikely to switch to a competitor, according to a study by VoiceLabs. Only 11 percent would consider making that jump. "It does put a certain amount of pressure on Google," said Victoria Petrock, a principal analyst at eMarketer. "Amazon came out very early and aggressively." But she and other analysts think Google has a good shot at pulling ahead of Amazon. That's because while Alexa, the digital assistant that powers the Echo, is an unexpected hit, Google may have a formidable edge -- the trove of data that comes with 18 years of being a search company. Think about everything you confide to Google: your emails (Gmail), your whereabouts and favorite hangouts (Maps), your work schedule (Calendar), your love of Steph Curry highlights (YouTube), your favorite recipes (Search), your weird fascination with anglerfish (Search, again), or your obsession with World War I trivia (Search is really powerful). If Google leverages all that personal data the right way, Home could offer a better experience than the Echo. (CNET Reviews -- independent from its news department -- last month gave the nod to Home, after previously going with the Echo.) "Google has some natural advantages because of the information people are willing to share with them," said Frank Gillett, an analyst at Forrester Research. And Google also has the software chops to pull it off. "It's a whole level of invisible engineering a lot of us don't appreciate," he said. Last month, Google announced multiaccount support for the assistant. That means Home can recognize more than one voice and surface personal information, preferences, calendar items and other stuff based on who's talking. On a conference call earlier this month, Pichai called the feature a "game-changer." We'll see if it is. eMarketer's Petrock calls it "a very important step." At this week's Google I/O (last year's event drew 7,000 developers), we'll hear what Pichai's next steps are -- and if they're strides, jumps or stumbles.

However, Netflix has now confirmed to us that blocking modified devices from downloading the app was intentional. This is the full statement: With our latest 5.0 release, we now fully rely on the Widevine DRM provided by Google; therefore, many devices that are not Google-certified or have been altered will no longer work with our latest app and those users will no longer see the Netflix app in the Play Store. If you're not familiar with it, Widevine is a Google-made DRM technology that works across various desktop and mobile platforms. Widevine categorizes devices into three security levels, ranging from all processes running in the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) to not running anything in TEE at all. However, the Play Store listing seems tied to a device's SaftetyNet status (which is used by Android Pay), rather than the Widevine TEE. For example, Artem's bootloader-unlocked stock Pixel is still on Widevine Level 1, the most secure level, but fails SafetyNet because it is unlocked. The update's changelog also confirms the: "Version 5.0 only works with devices that are certified by Google and meet all Android requirements." What isn't exactly clear is why only the Play store listing is blocked, but the app itself continued to function normally. I tried both Netflix 4.16 and 5.0.4 (the latest version, from today), and both worked without problems on my unlocked and rooted Galaxy Tab S (which is labeled as Widevine Security Level 3). Maybe at some point the app will stop working, but that does not appear to be the case right now. If you have a blocked device, I recommend following the Pushbullet channel for Netflix on APKMirror (click the Pushbullet button on that page) so you can continue to receive updates outside the Play Store.

First the vpn's now this... why oh why??? Jimk4003 Surely because licensing is regionally specific, and because rooting has the potential to defeat DRM. I get that it might be annoying for some people, but aren't the reasons obvious? David Juarez But root?? Lol Semianonymous Probably an effort to reduce Region spoofing? Idk how easy that is to do on a stock device. Jimk4003 Because rooting has the potential to defeat DRM. mjh49783ab DRM doesn't work. All DRM does is inconvenience the end user. Jimk4003 Possibly. But Netflix have to negotiate licencing deals with the movie studios, and having DRM helps reassure the studios that the movies they have spent millions of dollars making aren't going to get stolen off Netflix without any attempt to stop it. mjh49783ab One could make the argument that rooting the phone may compromise the DRM. But blocking users from unlocking their phones to switch carriers? That is total bullshit, and is just the sort of thing that encourages users to pirate the content. Jimk4003 Netflix are blocking you from switching carriers? lomsha Sim unlocked phones are fine, unlocked bootloaders are blocked. mjh49783ab They didn't exactly make that clear in the article when I last read it. h4rr4r The studios need to reconsider blu rays then. Way easier to rip. Nothing they do will stop piracy. This kind of thing actually encourages it. Jimk4003 Maybe studios do need to consider Blu-ray's. That isn't Netflix's problem though. h4rr4r No Netflix problem is making sure they don't let the studios reduce the value of their product. If Amazon video works on my devices and Netflix does not that is a big deal to me. In that case I might as well sign up for more addon channels on Amazon with the mkney that currently goes to Netflix. Jimk4003 Agreed. But the studios are responsible for making the product they redistribute. It's certainly a balancing act, and I can see both sides of the argument, but Netflix isn't an inalienable right, and those who don't meet the T&C's are going to miss out. h4rr4r Sure, but the studios and Netflix are going to create pirates with these kind of actions. People aren't going to miss out. They will just pirate what they can't get legally. Jimk4003 Sure, but again, it's a tiny fraction of users. If Netflix can negotiate better terms with studios by blocking rooted devices, and thus improve their business overall at the expense of a few fringe users, it stands to reason that is what Netflix will do. Doby Gillis whaa fucking whaa. Sergio Carmona The only obvious thing here is your sarcasm detector not working properly. Go have it fixed please. Jimk4003 Nah, I'm good. h4rr4r So the reason are to make the product worse for the consumer. Great idea, now piracy looks better and better. Jimk4003 What percentage of phones are rooted though? Most people won't care, or even notice the change. h4rr4r It does not matter, if it drives even one person to piracy that is a loss. Jimk4003 But if they can ensure better licensing deals via these new terms, which will attract more customers at the expense of a few rooted users who make up a tiny fraction of overall users; will Netflix care about that loss? h4rr4r But if it encourages piracy the other side of the contract should want to avoid it. Gaining customers in the short term like this hurts the whole market in the long term. Cyber_Akuma Because yeah, people are going to rip movies from Netflix and not off a Blu-Ray.... and even IF they were to attempt to rip them off Netflix, they would use a PHONE and not a PC.... Jimk4003 Ripping Blu-rays isn't Netflix's problem, and Netflix don't need to try and guess what device someone would try and commit piracy with, when the technology exists to restrict them all. Cyber_Akuma You are missing the point, people aren't going to be ripping from Netflix over ripping from a Blu-Ray, and on top of that, they sure as hell aren't going to be ripping off a phone. And actually, you are wrong, the technology to "resist them all" does NOT actually exist. There is no one technology that "restricts them all" but several different technologies for different platforms with various levels of viability and success. Jimk4003 I said 'the technology exists'. When did I say it was a single piece of technology? Let's not be those guys who get in a pedantic argument about semantics on the internet. Regarding the issue under discussion; Netflix's job is to make their platform as robust as possible against piracy, using whatever technology is available to them. Blu-Ray simply isn't their problem. Cyber_Akuma Because just arguing "technology exists" is worthless, plenty of technology exists, and plenty of it is misused. Technically the technology to remotely brick your phone exists too, doesn't mean it's fine to use just because it "exists". And no, their platform already is robust, you are trying to ignore the fact that people ripping movies off a phone is a complete and total non-issue just to try to argue for Netflix's sake, this is ESPECIALLY considering the fact that it harms far more legitimate people than it helps. Sorry, but no, just a plain and completely undesputable NO. You can't argue that it's ok to use something that will hurt a large majority of people just to potentially possibly stop an extreme minority of people who would not even use this method anyway. That's like arguing it's ok to burn down a house to kill a spider. Jimk4003 "You can't argue that it's ok to use something that will hurt a large majority of people". We're talking about Netflix blocking rooted users; in what reality do they constitute the 'large majority' of Android users? Cyber_Akuma I meant the majority of the rooted users. Last time I checked, over 25% of people with an Android device had root access, which is several million users. And OF those several million rooted users, how many do you think actually use their rooted phone and Netflix app to pirate content? Less than 1% Hell, less than 0.1%? They are hurting over 99% of rooted Android users, which while not the majority of Android users is still a lot, to attempt to stop (and not even that effectively as there have been work-around for SafetyNet checks for nearly a year now) an extreme minority OF a minority from doing something they are unlikely to do due to other methods anyway. Richard Markert >I meant the majority of the rooted users. Even the majority of rooted users is a drop in the ocean when it comes to Android users worldwide. Cyber_Akuma Again, over 25%. You also completely missed the point of the argument in that this hurts nearly all rooted users that would not use this maliciously. Lord Argyris Looks like I'll have to start updating manually then. Or just not bother with the app at all since I rarely use Netflix on my phone as it is. SpasilliumNexus Thank goodness the 3T's Open Beta of OxygenOS is good enough for me to not unlock my device and stick with complete stock. Now I wonder why I haven't received any Netflix app updates beyond 4.16.1 build 15145 on the Play Store, when APKMirror has 4 newer versions. ast00 They asked for it. Now pirate their content knowing that you tried doing it the legal way, but THEY declined. Φώτης Because unlocking your Android powered device is such a "bad" thing to do. Whatever Netflix. Ailín Ó’S Ναι, ακριβώς... 😑 C64 How about some English Rob Google translate says that "Ναι, ακριβώς" translates to "Yes, exactly". pcriz How about some Google translate :-/ C64 This is an English website, so you have to talk English. I'm Dutch, so i talk (or try to talk) English too. It hasn't to be perfect, but it would be bs if I talked Dutch over here.

EowynCarter Yeah me too. And unless they change this, bye netflix account. No point in something I can't use anymore. Demoncat The funny part about video DRM is it's easily defeated. It's more convenient to steal the videos than to deal with the DRM restrictions. Fedup Exactly. Between VPN'ed torrents and nzbs, my Sonarr downloads all TV shows (netflix, HBO, ABC/CBS/NBC/FOX) automatically within minutes of them being ripped and posted by others. It is 100% automated, and with my Plex server running, I can watch shows anywhere - cost = $0.00. I don't do this to save money. I do it for the convenience, lack of ads, and freedom of time/place shifting. Heck, some shows actually download BEFORE they air on network TV (i.e. Designated Survivor). stan dex 97 new dark web premium links . also included are netfix lifetime membership links as well as graphic Live chat links (use anonymously) https://satoshibox.com/axbr7vnm6ifzk8hwtcreoe28/buy d0x360 I cancelled​ my account, sent them feedback and then just asked a friend who I let use HBO go and a Chromecast ultra if I could use their Netflix. David Gabel That seems rather dumb. Why cancel your service to them yet still use it via someone else? You're not teaching them anything. For an example, let's say you have a MacBook, and Apple does something to piss you off. You sell your MacBook, but then borrow a friend's MacBook. Nothing was actually accomplished. d0x360 Nothing was accomplished? I cancelled my account and let them know why. Now they aren't making money off me but I still to use their service. Your analogy is deeply flawed...deeply. So deeply I don't think you understand exactly what an analogy is. David Gabel So, you're "not giving them money" yet you still support them by using their product. It still seems like your logic is flawed. If you're really that pissed at Netflix, don't use it. Period. Use a different service instead of supporting them by borrowing it off a friend, as they are also giving them money (and support) , too via their subscription. revbones How is using their service for free "supporting" them? They aren't getting any revenue off you if you're not paying them. Saying you're supporting them by not paying them is a little stupid don't you think? xyz lol. So by your "logic" a person who pirates House of Cards is also supporting Netflix ? BobButtons You're doing the opposite of supporting. You're getting the benefits of their service while stopping payment and adding to server load which they pay for. David Gabel So far, your stance is the only one that makes sense. The rest so far are noise Sir Doogie Houser M.D.Esq. 200 You seen like an incredulous douch who I'd suplex onto a park bench for being a lap dog bitch.How is canceling or stealing not doing something.Also,its not a fucking macbook jerkoff its a paid service for TV on a phone they expect to be paid for.BTFO nagi Just another step that makes pirating the same content more convenient... we should really be going the other way if they ever want piracy to be reduced. lomsha Funny thing is their content is available to stream all over the internet. Don't see how this move fights piracy as long as computers have access. This just alienates legit users who are doing nothing nefarious on unlocked/rooted devices. Richard Branches By one everybody pays... Pathum Addarapathirana Dude I root my phone to just get iPhone emojis and to tether without my carrier knowing. Like I'm not stealing anything this will just make me stop paying for Netflix. Latheryin Just a heads up. Those treating hiding mods are fake. There is no way to hide if from the carrier. Heck if they wanted to they could see every web page you load from a ton of different places and ways. Yan Minari That’s why god invented VPN Latheryin Yes but even then it doesn't block everything. qqqqqq My provider absolutely blocks tethering - I've been using various methods, including VPNs, to block it for literally YEARS... Hasn't been difficult. Dylan Harris That's not true. All you have to due to bypass tethering limits on t-mobile is to change the TTL on the tethered device. Latheryin That just gets by the automated checks. Get a live person to randomly pick your account (not really likely but happens) and it is not had to tell if someone is tethering. Dmitri Smirnov All that person will be able to tell is whether customer is using a lot of data or not. And this is the root of the problem: be honest that you are limited traffic, instead of trying to play this game of "we'll pretent we are giving you unlimited data and in return you'll only use small-format mobile device, so that we'll hope that you won't be able to use as much of it". Kind of "all you can eat, but you have to only use a tea cup and one chopstick". Latheryin No the issue is people being entitled and taking advantage of things. You have people running their gaming systems and using hundreds of gb a month. Not only is that kinda dumb but it violate the fair use act in most cell TOS. If people didn't abuse the system then it wouldn't be an issue. Also just some food for thought. If they can't tell anything more then a lot of data just how do they route the traffic properly? Make no mistake. If the carrier wanted to they could tell. I know for a fact that there is a team for both att and Verizon that is tasked with just that. Dmitri Smirnov >No the issue is people being entitled and taking advantage of things. You have people running their gaming systems and using hundreds of gb a month. "taking advantage" I thought that people were in their right by using what they paid for. Allright, tell me this - is it allright for me to watch 4K video on my phone (since the screens allow it now)? What's the difference between this and me watching the same stream on my laptop over my phone's connection? What if I just redirect the video stream to my TV using WiDi or any other technology? How is browsing a site from a laptop different from browsing it from a phone network-congestion-wise? And then it boils down to the same argument - carriers are just hoping you'll use the network less from you phone device, as it's less convenient. The more convenient smartphones become for consuming large volumes of traffic, the sooner carriers will have to more away from this scan and expose the actual numbers. > If people didn't abuse the system then it wouldn't be an issue. If carriers would be honest and upfront about "hidden" caps, then people would not be able to game the system. > Also just some food for thought. If they can't tell anything more then a lot of data just how do they route the traffic properly? Make no mistake. If the carrier wanted to they could tell. Latheryin Tethering was never even an extra charge until people started taking advantage of the mobile networks. Watching 4k videos is not a big deal, using 200gb of mobile data in a cycle is flat out stupid. Mobile networks were not designed for that type of traffic from a single device. Nor was it made to handle running your ps4 while you are gaming. Why do you think that pages are made to be mobile friendly? Not only is it a usability issue but a data usage issue as well. It's not hidden. All people have to do is read the TOS. It's all right there. Yet most people just don't want to take the time to do it and then get made about it. Can't blame the carriers for that. Dmitri Smirnov > Watching 4k videos is not a big deal, using 200gb of mobile data in a cycle is flat out stupid. a) I'm glad we're finally on the same page that the real problem for networks is data usage and not tethering or no tethering. b) You are aware that you're contradicting yourself in the same sensense? 4K 60Fps video bitrate is ~20-40 MiB/s which gives an average movie the size of about 72GiB. so by your definition watching a movie in good quality is OK as long as you don't watch more than 3 of them in a month. c) how is using mobile data that you paid for - stupid? If there are caps - announce them and make it impossible to go over them instead of shaming people who actually decide to take you up on your offer. d) tethering has not been an extra charge until telcos understood that they could charge extra for it (just like them toying with idea of charging extra for Instant Messenger traffic, because it undercuts their SMS plans). > It's not hidden. All people have to do is read the TOS. It's all right there. Yet most people just don't want to take the time to do it and then get made about it. Can't blame the carriers for that. Well, carriers are the ones calling their plans "unlimited" and hiding the actual caps either buried deep in the ToS or behind the vague "reasonable usage". So don't blame people for not wanting to wade through pages of legalspeak just to learn that you lied and "unlmited" is just "50Gb and then throttled". Fedup Agreed. The problem is the AMOUNT of data consumed by a given user account - no how it is consumed. If carriers are concerned about individuals abusing their network, then they need to flag those accounts that use an excessive amount of bandwidth - whether it's through tethering or directly on the device itself. I could easily burn through 150GB/mo on my TMO Note 4 w/o tethering simply by leaving my Blue Iris app connected and streaming 24/7. So it's actually very easy to abuse the system without ever turning on the tethering. Android Developer Is the tether solution needed even if you do it using USB ? Fulbring What a stupid move. I pay for the premium for Netflix and I never thought that I might have to cancel my service just because they did this. The only reason why I have root is because of AdAway and TitaniumBackup. I still use the stock OnePlus 3T ROM. Wasn't expecting this at all.... Kinda suck. Will be interesting to see how many customers they lose. Julian Berger Not enough to change it back... 4Ui812 DRM has no place in our lives. I suspect Netflix will have a change of heart within 6 months. Branko Xiaomi phones say bye bye to Netflix. Google go fuck yourselves. Steve_Jobroni Go fucking buy a windows phone. 天地人 Seriously though Windows phones are great. The only problem with them is the lack of applications. Otherwise, it runs great on low-end hardware, has a great UI, the homescreen is innovative, synchronisation with Windows PCs is cool, etc. dukaki Don't forget that you can use the Netflix website on Edge instead of their shitty app, and it streams at full 1080p, even on my L650 with a 720p screen. 天地人 Wait the Netflix application hasn't an option to stream at FHD? dukaki Nope, just 480p like on android. The device has to be "certified" and there are no certified windows phones afaik. The WP app doesn't even have downloads yet, I think. Edit: Just checked, no option to download here but you can on the desktop app. EowynCarter Might end with a visit at the apple store in my case. Windows phone is kind of not supported anymore. Jimk4003 This is Netflix, not Google. Cyber_Akuma Google invented this SafetyNet crap, let anyone use it for any reason (Hell, Pokemon GO of all things started using it), and over the last year have been making it even more and more strict and unforgiving. So no, a HUGE part of the blame does lie on Google for being openly hostile towards rooted users and not giving a damn about them. Jimk4003 There are legitimate reasons to use Safetynet to check the integrity of a device: Android Pay (or banking apps in general) is one example. It isn't necessarily hostility to root users; it's just a reality that Google need to be able to demonstrate to banks or other third parties that their OS is secure, and that people can't bypass built in security safeguards. Netflix need to do the same with the studios they redistribute content for; and they've chosen to use Safetynet to do it. Netflix isn't a human right; you have no inalienable right to root your phone and to use Netflix. Cyber_Akuma Except that not even my own banking app uses SafetyNet, it still has root checking and certain sensitive features are disabled if I am rooted, but not the entire app. Furthermore, it IS hostility to rooted users, because anyone can toss SafetyNet into their app for any reason whatsoever (such as games using it "just because" in case of cheaters... which doesn't even help at all to stop them). Google has been completely unwilling to work out ANY sort of compromise or method that can keep a phone secure without basically tossing rooted users under the bus. Jimk4003 What sort of compromise do you envision? Cyber_Akuma I am saying that they didn't even try. PCs by default obviously allow admin accounts all the time, even as the main user account (as much as that is not recommended) yet can maintain security. Google when they were confronted with people who were hurt by SafetyNet, legitimate users mind you, basically just shrugged them off and didn't even bother considering what could be done to allow the device to remain secure while also having such safeties in place. I mean, all these apps that you can use on your phone, can also be used on a PC, many of them available in either a browser or native app format, yet it remains secure. There is no reason this could not be done with Android, especially considering it used Linux as a base, they are just refusing to even consider it. Jimk4003 Don't you already have that choice? Your phone is sold without root access (i.e. no admin rights), and you can then choose whether or not to root your device and gain elevated privileges. If you do choose to root your device, you will lose access to some Safetynet enabled applications. You can, of course, unroot if necessary. Cyber_Akuma First of all, not all phones are. Especially in non-US countries. Second, it shouldn't have to be a choice. How many PC apps refuse to run under an admin account? Practically none. I shouldn't have to choose between having root access or being able to use a apps that more and more are starting to add this nonsense to them. Third, it's not even just root, even having an unlocked BOOTLOADER now, even if your rom is 100% stock and unrooted, can trip SafetyNet, it didn't used to be that strict. It's ridiculous to claim one should be able to have one or the other, even SafetyNet could have been designed to not be this brokenly strict, but Google had no interest in doing so, and they are rapidly making having root more and more useless while we still have to deal with all the junk they force on your phone from the manufacturer... that you can only remove with root. Jimk4003 Well, it is what it is. You believe you shouldn't have to make a choice, whereas I believe life is all about making choices and living with the outcomes. We seldom get everything we want, and neither Netflix, nor rooting, are inalienable rights. Whether or not you think it should be a choice, it is one; choose what you feel is best for you. Cyber_Akuma That's not even an argument, that's just trying to claim that the status quo should remain for no reason other than it is the status quo. It shouldn't have to be a choice, and arguing that people have to choose between root and having an increasingly less amount of apps just because "it is what it is" is insanity. In fact, it wasn't even the status quo before until Google started pulling this nonsense with SafetyNet a short while ago. That doesn't mean people should just accept it. Jimk4003 It's not an argument, because there is no argument to be had. The reality of the situation is self-evident; you can't have a rooted device and install Netflix via Google Play. Accepting the status quo has nothing to do with it; it's simply acknowledging reality. You have to choose what's more important to you; Netflix or rooting your phone. Finding the reality frustrating, as you clearly do, won't make it any less real. If this was a serious discussion on human rights; censorship, migration, justice, gender equality etc., then it's important in a democracy to be aware of your rights and responsibilities, and challenge the status quo where necessary. But this isn't anything like that. This is two for-profit corporations, Google and Netflix, who provide services to which you have no fundamental right to access, nor any obligation to use. You can choose to pay for their services and accept their terms and conditions, or you can choose not to. You don't get to pick the terms and conditions of the service someone else is providing you; however you are free to not use the service if you don't like the terms and conditions under which they are provided. That's it; it's no simpler or more complicated than that. Ranting on the internet about how unfair you perceive it to be is irrelevant. Again, it is what it is. Cyber_Akuma Again, there is no "it is what it is" argument. There should be no choice, PERIOD. You are basically saying that people should not complain about this just because "it is what it is". No, it is NOT what it is, it should NOT BE what it is, and people can and WILL complain that it SHOULD NOT be what it is. You aren't even making any rational arguments anymore, just re-stating what the current situation is and then basically claiming that people should not want or expect better. Jimk4003 You can want or expect better if you like. Netflix, like every other for-profit enterprise in a capitalist system, will either succeed or fail based on its ability to turn a profit. Right now, Netflix is turning a profit, and clearly thinks it can be more profitable by excluding rooted users whose theoretical ability to circumvent DRM restrictions may impact its ability to secure rights to new content. Clearly you disagree with their stance, and the only way to see for sure if your disagreement is warranted is to watch their financial performance from here on out. None of the above changes the fact that you aren't entitled to Netflix. You've chosen to root your phone, and Netflix have recently chosen to exclude rooted users. That leaves you with a choice to make. Even if you think that choice is unfair, even if you think you should be able to have both. The reality is you can't have both, and you will have to choose. Again, Netflix isn't a right. Go elsewhere if you disagree with their business practices; that's how capitalism works. Beyond that, you're just having a spat with reality; and that's a tough fight to win ;) Cyber_Akuma Actually, what do you think would lose them more profits, the theoretical minority OF a minority that MIGHT rip movies on their phones (which still requires a Netflix account in the first place) or blocking that 25% minority? Also, drop this "right" nonsense. No, seriously, drop it right now. People are paying for a Netflix account, they DO have a right to get the service they paid for. Netflix made zero warning or mention of this impending block, they pulled it out of nowhere for paying customers. So sorry, but they DO have a right to the service, since they are paying for it. Sony was found to be legally in the wrong when they removed the OtherOS feature from the PS3, because why? Because people PAID for the console when it had that feature, they DID have a right to what they paid for. You're just having a spat with arguing for argument's sake when you don't even have an argument. Jimk4003 There is no argument; it's the reality of the situation. Netflix have implemented DRM controls that block access to the Netflix app via the Play Store on rooted devices. I do understand why Netflix want to tighten their DRM procedures, and I do understand why some people have been left frustrated by this change. The reality is, however, if you want to download the Netflix app via Google Play, you will need an un-rooted phone; such as the phones used by the majority of Android users. That's all that's happening. I get that you don't like it. But stamping your foot and shouting 'no fair, no fair' achieves nothing. Netflix are entitled to run their business how they see fit within the law; and consumers get to choose whether they want to give Netflix their business or not. That's all there is to it. Don't like the way Netflix do business; don't give Netflix your money. Cyber_Akuma All you are doing with the "it is what it is" argument is just repeating what the article is saying. That is not conductive to anything. Anyone who has read the article knows what is happening right now. And sorry, but you are doing the same stamping your foot with the "well, it is what it is" argument. Not to mention that you are also wrong, because over the last 5 or so years ALONE there have been dozens of examples of consumers speaking out against policies or DRM and the companies begin forced to reverse it from the backlash. So you are doing nothing but hurting legitimate users by trying to argue "it is what it is". And again, no, they are not entitled to run their business in a way that without warning locks customers out of what they paid for, Sony tried this... and got in legal trouble and lost. So sorry, but you are wrong, and you have been nothing but wrong this entire argument. Netflix isn't' "entitled" to do this, people DO have a reason to complain, there IS a reason to complain, complaining HAS changed such practices before, and all you are doing is further hurting legitimate users by attempting to insist the "it is what it is" non-argument. Your entire argument has been fundamentally wrong from the start. Jimk4003 It's not my argument; it's simply Netflix's position. I get you don't agree with it, but it's totally valid for Netflix to wish to strengthen their DRM procedures. You do know I'm not responsible for Netflix's decision making, right? It is what it is; I wouldn't get too upset about it. Cyber_Akuma Again, "it is what it is" is not a valid argument. Jimk4003 No it's not an argument. Again, there is no argument necessary; the reality of the situation is self-evident, and no amount of arguing here will change it. The fact is this; YOU rooted your phone. You weren't forced. You should have known that by rooting your phone you are modifying the device beyond its factory specification. You should have known that this essentially makes you responsible for the proper operation of the device; you no longer have the device manufacturer or Google to turn to when software that you have modified doesn't work as expected. You should also have known that rooting prevents a device from complying with the compatibility test suite, and that this can affect your devices ability to function correctly. You should have been aware of the SafetyNet API, and anticipated the fact that this API would be adopted more and more broadly as Google promoted its usage. You can't blame Google for this; as before, once you modify your device beyond its factory spec, you're responsible for supporting yourself. Rooting a device is at the owners risk. You've now found yourself in a situation where a modification you have made to your device prevents you from accessing a service you want to use. That's on you; no-one made you modify your device, no-one said they would take responsibility for the changes you have made to your device, and rooted users are expected to assume liability for any ramifications and complications they face as a result of their decision to modifying their device. Netflix are well within their rights to enforce DRM on their product by using the SafetyNet API provided by Google, and the Google documentation clearly states rooted devices will fail the CTS check. This documentation is publicly available. You went ahead and rooted your device anyway. That's on you. It's no-one elses job to make sense of the decisions you have taken. You're free to carry on using Netflix if you return your device to a state where the integrity of the device can be verified. Or you're free to carry on using a rooted device and living with the compromises that entails. Your choice. Cyber_Akuma I don't think you get it. All you are doing is parroting what the article is saying. Furthermore, despite there being plenty of examples of complaining doing EXACTLY what you claim it cannot do, that is to change such decisions, you keep repeating that "complaining will do nothing". You are a broken record, arguing the same "it is what it is" argument over and over so you can avoid actually thinking. An argument (and yes, no matter how much YOU stomp your feet that it is not, it IS an argument) that has already been disproven over and over and over. You also ignored that there are many countries where phones are already sold rooted, or how such things don't effect using such services on a PC with admin rights which are the same thing, or the dozens of other holes in your logic large enough to sail a ship through. There is no "you should have been aware" because this is a total lapse in common sense and my device is in no way incompatible from a hardware or software level, but rather, the app is purposely rejecting it. Furthermore, they made no prior warning whatsoever. This is like arguing "you should have known modern cars could be remotely disabled" if a dealership decides to just disable all cars with an aftermarket radio installed. I don't know where to even begin with all the broken wrong logic in that last post. Why are you even here if you couldn't care less? You are free to carry on being a living example of "First they came", but don't come crying about how nobody else is listening to you because you could not possibly be any more wrong. I DO have a right to use Netflix on my device, rooted or no, if I am paying for it. If you argue against this, you are wrong. People DO have a right to root their devices, if you argue against this, you are wrong. People DO have a right (and have many many MANY times in the past) to challenge the "it is what it is" status quo, if you argue against this, you are wrong. And I know you WILL argue against this, which will mean that, see above, you are wrong. I have been more than patient with your insane thick-headnedness. At this point I can't tell if you are being willfully ignorant or really are just that ignorant. Or just trolling, that is an option as well. There is no way anyone rational at this point can continue to argue the insanity that you have argued. Jimk4003 I interpret personal insults as an indicator that the individual making them no longer has any faith in their actual arguments, and so I think it's time to call time on this particular discussion. As you've pointed out, neither of us is getting anywhere. It's been fun, but once it starts getting abusive, the fun has to stop. It's a shame, because DRM Vs individual user rights has the potential to be a really interesting discussion topic. I hope you get what you're after; and that the reality of the situation will change to be more in line with what you think it should be. Unfortunately I imagine the situation regarding DRM and rooted devices will only get more restrictive going forward. Take care. Cyber_Akuma You purposely instigate people into losing their patience with you, and then claim "I win because you got angry", especially when the anger is because you were refusing to understand the entire argument throughout this entire mess. Richard Markert Root is, by definition, unsecure. Any time you have userland processes that have access to ring0 you are inherently unsecure, as there are no restrictions placed upon running code at that point. Cyber_Akuma And yet, there are ways to run it securely on PCs. Netflix and online banking would not be available on PCs if it wasn't. TedPhillips mostly agree. by providing a turn-key 'lockdown' check, and further by ret-conning it into playstore access (let's see how far they take that) -google is now openly hostile to anyone who bought into android for it's ability to customize and truly 'own' your own device. the open source roots of android was a big differentiator vs something like iOS, but now that they have dominate market position - they are walking away from that without concern. (only worrying about how slow they need to boil the frog to get away with it) meanwhile, what middle manager is going to say 'no' to adding safetyNet checks in their app or play store listing? it is an easy way for them to write down on potential risks, unjustified (which it pretty much always is) or not. blindexecutioner So the solution is to install from outside the play store. That's great for security. Way to go. Richard Markert No they don't. Since Windows 7, new and default users are not Admin accounts. koiulpoi Sorry, this is absolutely wrong. The first user created on a Windows PC has full administrative access, limited by UAC. You can still delete System32, it's just mildly harder than it used to be. If "new and default users" were not Admin accounts, they couldn't install software, so... Richard Markert Default user accounts are higher than Limited accounts, but not as high as Admin accounts. That's why they can install software. Linux users are not admins but can still install software, right? It started on Windows 7, expanded in 8/8.1 and now in Windows 10 a user account behaves just like a user account in Linux. It has no access to %systemdir% unless you manually go in the folder properties and give your user account Admin permissions to it. You can still run things AS admin by giving the permission at runtime, but since all that requires is pressing a button (if your built-in admin account isn't passworded, which it isn't by default, one step forward two back, sigh) and most users are too "stupid" to simply not press that button. koiulpoi It's really funny when people speak authoritatively about something they're so wrong about. The first account created by the Windows OOBE is automatically added to the Administrators group. This means they're an Administrator. They have Administrative privileges. The fact that certain actions are blocked until you click "yes" on a simple UAC prompt doesn't stop this; they're in "Admin Approval Mode", which can be disabled via GPO if you care to. If you buy a computer from Dell (example), set it up, then go to System32 and start deleting .dll files, it'll ask for administrative privileges, but you can click yes and away it goes! Some files are protected at "SYSTEM" level, which is higher than administrator, but DEFAULT USERS ARE ADMINISTRATORS. This has ABSOLUTELY nothing to do with the "password" on the built-in "Administrator" account. That account is disabled out-of-the-box. Please, you're digging a bigger hole trying to look "right". How to prove this: Set up a new computer. Set up user default for MS. Start -> Run -> netplwiz -> Be amazed that your user is part of the group "Administrators". TechGuy22 Haha kodi Doesn't matter to me I Stopped paying for Netflix long time ago. C64 Haha Teranium TV 😎 TechGuy22 I like that too. You can even get the mod one and remove the ads. Lol C64 I know, i always use those. I want to pay for the dev, but there's no option to do that. Koko time is coming with a big update to tim242 Thief. Renato Santos This is stupid. Congratulations, Netflix. Jan-Lk Else It is also getting more and more necessary to unlock / root devices due to missing updates etc. But I'm not a Netflix customer and won't become one. C64 Whahaha, this has to be the most retarded move of the year in any category (even Trump can't top this). I'm glad i don't use Old Crap Flix. A Person Hillary, then Netflix. C64 Nope sorry. Since Trump is your president i can't take America serious anymore A Person Timeout, you're not even a US citizen? No interest in your opinion. James F Wow. Just wow. I can't take you seriously either if that's how you treat people. Not cool, man. A Person "Wow, just wow"? When he can vote in our elections I'll take his opinions of our elections seriously. It is highly ill-informed anyhow. Paul Sterling A person wins! Marcelove Timeout, you are a Trump supporter? No interest in your opinion (neither anyone smart in the world). Roy Riddex Just so I'm clear on this, by unlocked are we talking about SIM unlocked? lomsha No no, unlocked bootloader. Roy Riddex Thanks Corbin Davenport Unlocked bootloader. pbergonzi I wonder how long they'll stick with that premise seeing as how much public opinion expressed here is against them. Screw them. Get the APK somewhere else or install magisk and hide your root. Too many people root their devices and have a good reason for doing so and Netflix should not penalize them. Doby Gillis Dude, normal people don't give a fuck about rooted phones. It's just the elitist twats who do it anymore. twiz0r Dude, you're an elitist twat. Richard Markert Most people who root seem to be. The sentiment among rooters is "if you don't root your phone, you're not as good as me and don't deserve to have a phone. Root you stupid noob!" twiz0r thanks for confirming your twatness. good day. C64 One word ..... Bullshit Corey Kinard I've yet to see that... Maybe you just feel like that because they do in fact know more than you? Richard Markert My first version of Android was 1.5. I've seen it for many years. How long have you been in the scene? EowynCarter My phone isn't rooted. And not compatible anymore ! Franco Fassio Unlocked bootloader maybe? EowynCarter Yes. But seam I can't lock it without wipe. So screw you Netflix. Marcelove Let me guess, your profile pic is that right? https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/0f0c4f3e3ce40074aebfe58d80511d4a0b7d4a94896ce54d82e448a1cd2e3ceb.jpg bruce lancaster Dude. It isn't just rooted phones - Also unlocked. Elitists get their iphones and galaxy s8s from att and verizon. Normal people get their devices from amazon, ebay, newegg, gearbest etc. Jimk4003 I'm sure Netflix are terrified that the tiny fraction of Android users who come to this site, and the similarly tiny fraction who root their phones, are bothered. The rest of the world won't care. bruce lancaster An article in Wireless Week (cellphone industry rag) a couple of months back says it's now a majority of phones in Asia that are unlocked and Europe is getting pretty close to 50/50. US passed 30% unlocked around Christmas. People aren't getting their phones from ATT, Verizon, etc any more now that they have to pay full retail and don't get a free or heavily discounted flagship device with contract renewal. They are getting them from Amazon, Gearbest, Newegg, etc and moving their sim. If I owned stock in Netflix right now, I'd sell it quick on this news. Everything that isn't already mobile is going mobile. Alienating half the European market and 30% of the US market is asinine. Fedup Yup. Ditched my flagship Samsung phone for a 'budget' Moto G5 Plus that is 100% compatible with all four US carriers (and their dozens of MNVOs). Swapping providers is as easy as changing the sim. And despite the slower spec'ed hardware, the carrier bloat-free Nougat is WAY faster than my TW Galaxy phone - and the battery life is INSANE. C64 Probably 90 % of the people don't know what root is. Almost every person I know owns an Android device, but i'm the only geek who flashes and roots his devices bruce lancaster It isn't just rooted phones but also unlocked phones. Got your phone on amazon? Got it on ebay? Got it from gearbest? Got it from newegg? Yup. No netflix for you without jumping through enough hoops that you'll actually know about rooting by the time you get it done. Fedup Are we conflating a carrier-unlocked vs. bootloader unlocked phone? They are two distinctly different things, and I doubt that having a carrier-unlocked phone (i.e. using a TMO phone on ATT, or VZ on Sprint) has any impact on SafetyNet or Widevine. pbergonzi Judging from the posts here it looks like nobody who roots their phone uses Netflix anyway so I guess it's moot. But the outcry sure did get them a bunch of free publicity. T4rd This is what Magisk is for. Pretty sure if I can still use Android Pay with my rooted 6P, I can still use/update Netflix through the Play Store. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Magisk still requires that you unlock your bootloader, which is enough to trigger safety net these days, so that won't work. TechGuy22 You don't know how magisk works do you Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ I understand that Magisk is a great tool for modifying my system without actually modifying it. I understand that there are many modules that allow you to do things like hide root, bypass security modules, skin your system, and plenty of other things. What I don't understand is how you can install magisk without unlocking your bootloader. Back when I originally tried it out with pokemon go, it worked well for a while, but eventually even just having my bootloader unlocked was all it took to throw SafetyNet. If that's not an issue anymore, then great! But maybe say that instead of being snarky. Thomas Gladdines Bootloader can be simply locked after rooting and installing a custom recovery. Edwin O. Lol no You could, but then you can't flash anything with said recovery... So no point Thomas Gladdines LOL the recovery doesn't stop working after a bootloader is locked, only fastboot won't flash images but the recovery can do whatever it wants to, update the rom, edit system files etc. Muzzy996 Well as an example for the Google Pixel: https://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=71901761&postcount=454 In this case all it takes is a kernel that supports Magisk and hides the fact that the bootloader is unlocked, at which point with Magisk Hide enabled all root and SafetyNet checks pass. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Excellent. I'll have to look back into this then, last time I used magisk it wasn't as capable, glad to see it's come this far. sbeaulieu Magical Hide is there for that Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Can Magical Hide hide that my bootloader is unlocked? Serious question, not being sarcastic or snarky as I was below. sbeaulieu It does make the SafetyNet check pass iJeggu Magisk itself doesn't hide an unlocked bootloader it only hides root but must custom roms simply delete the verifiedbootstate -flag which in turn makes safetynet pass even with an unlocked bootloader. Some older devices don't have this flag in their kernels in the first place so safetynet will accept that the flag is missing. Link to the patch that most custom roms (kernels to be specific) have to pass safetynet: https://github.com/sultanxda/android_kernel_oneplus_msm8996/commit/abc05b16bbd33521c2fffaf491c5657a94bfcfc5 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/5b1ff3f47e32d5f57ddadcd650a5b94725bd4e6242cea92e269f51e988d0d426.png T4rd Except it's working for me right now... jonzey231 This has been happening for a week now. I tweeted it to Ruddock a few days ago. Just didn't put together that it was because I was unlocked. https://twitter.com/jonzey231/status/862122438125072384 steelew Google really needs to start stealing from the root community the way apple takes from the jailbreak community. It feels like rooting is way down except for a few (legal) use cases. If it weren't for visual tweaks & usability tweaks, I would have no need to root (personally). This kind of stuff starts to make rooting unpleasant. I already can't use fingerprint auth in my banking app any more because root. Jesús Cuenca They do. I used rooms for like 8 years maybe? And a lot of the "new features" always come of the rom or root comunity. Right now i use roms, but not root. Marcelove I'm trying to stay indoors, but is complicate... Greenify for example, works at no root devices nowadays... But is way better with root and Xposed... Doze can't compare against Greenify... Maybe at version number 20 root wouldn't be necessary... Sandeep Raghuraman What about the version downloaded from Amazon app store though? Does that work fine? TwoBit Gary It worked, but it is old version without show downloads. Go to apkmirror oculairmedia Interesting move. I flashed a custom ROM on my Nexus 6 because stock was so slow that it was getting unusable, but screw me right ? Atoqir In my country lots of stuff doesn't work on unrooted devices. My bank app, payment app and local cable TV and digicorder app all stopped working. Also s-health doesn't work anymore and soon Netflix. Time to unroot Marcelove "Time to unroot" Sheep. Richard Markert Rooting is insecure. You don't need to access the system partition except to break things. Benjamin Walburn If that were the case then this wouldn't be an issue. Nobody is looking to break their phone. Richard Markert Few people I've talked to online know what they're doing when it comes to root. Most of those end up breaking things. Rooting is far too easy and probably shouldn't exist at all. Benjamin Walburn You could say the same about anything, not just modification of phones. Maybe you shouldn't own a car if you can't fix it yourself, or have kids if you aren't a doctor. Rooting isn't easy, it's made easy by the hard work of other people. It's not up to you what other people do with their property, you have no right to say that they shouldn't. And if someone breaks their phone, what does it have to do with you? It's their hobby and their phone. You're not their daddy. senoredusty Or use Magisk DJMix No need. You could use magisk su hide for the moment. it still passes the safetynet. I too use a banking app that cannot be used on normal root proocess faceless128 "please stop giving us money and use Kodi instead" Sounds like a great business plan! JD For the sake of Kodi's developers don't say Kodi in that context. ericshmerick Hrmm, every time I hear Kodi, I think of pirated content. Guess when people are like "I use Kodi for my 30TB media collection" I stop and wonder how... Yes, ripping a lifetime of DVDs, but nah. Probably piracy. C64 I know a few how really use it legally Powsniffer0110 Yea I use it legally 95% of the time. ErectBipedal nah man, I use Kodi to browse my 30TB of linux isos. Totally legit I swear. Chazz Matthews Torrents are legal too. Just depends on the content. Mike Honestly though, if pirate add-ons wern't available on kodi, 98% of the people using it now would not have even heard of it before. Even bad publicity is good publicity. They are not going to publicly come out and say it, but the add-on's are the only reason they're well known. Andy Roid But kodi makes piracy so easy! Blian Oh god, please stop. Nobody is using Kodi for their DVD rips. Railwayman I rather say Fusion and Exodus et al instead since Kodi is... Kodi and you have to install what you want. The Netflix business plan is for her more people on Exodus, Phoenix and SALTS - not to mention Terrarium TV and MovieBox as well. Kevin Strident Kodi is open source. If Kodi stops wanting to be as useful as it is now, someone will fork it and keep it doing what its users enjoy. cbstryker Kodi is just an open source media player. To watch any pirated content you either need to download it or install an unaffiliated plugin that streams from pirated sources. C64 Next kodi wil have drm build in. So people have to use forks. I stopped using kodi since i found Teranium TV. cbstryker That makes zero sense. Kodi's reason for existing would stop. C64 That's BS my friend, Kodi (xbmc) has started on the original xbox and was made and used as a media player Justin D Same...but with Plex and something else >.> Dany Lol I know right? I was using Kodi more than Netflix anyway so... Dmitry Stepanushkin Xposed + RootCloak or something similar will do it for most of apps for those who need root. So I think not a big problem. Abhishek Saral Not a big problem but a big annoyance. tehboogieman Hmm, rootcloak isn't working for me with netflix m477 No, it won't work. Safetynet always fails if you have closed activated, or if you just have an unlocked bootloader. Sometimes even by just having adb debugging turned on. Kan☆n MagiskSU and its manager app comes with a very good hider built-in. No Xposed needed. h4rr4r Beyond pointless. Netflix won by being easier than piracy, this threatens to turn back the clock on that. Lexster These companies don't seem to get that most people pirate because it's easier/cheaper than buying what they want. Yes, it's wrong, whatever, the point is streaming services made it easier for people, which outweighed the hassle of pirating it. You're right, this kind of thing is what will get people to start doing it again more. BobButtons If I can't use Netflix on my rooted phone, it's Netflix that'll go, not the root. They're encouraging piracy. YaKillaCJ Exactly. Screw it, I only have Netflix for convenience. This will also have negative impact on many devices and average consumers even if they never unlock or root. A lot don't have Google certification, such as upcoming OEMs. Then theirs beta roms like Xiaomi and OnePlus that run awesome. Marcelove Funny thing: I was about to become a subscriber of Netflix after seeing House of Cards by PirateBay but now through the official channel because I thought that Netflix deserved my money... Look : deservED... But this movie will keep me at PirateBay... Funny thing 2: I have a Moto G5 that I could unlock and root and I didn't it just because I wanna see how things are nowadays without root... And I use a lot of apps that would work better with root (Greenify for example)... So I would be able to use Netflix... And I won't and will stay that way only because this douchebag move... Congratulations Netflix... Funny thing 3: So happy that I waited till House of Cards release to become a subscriber... Netflix should learn something from Frank Underwood... And from Blockbuster... tim242 Yeah, sure you were. Once a thief, always a thief. koiulpoi This is the most untrue statement I've read on this website. Thomas Elephants can fly 天地人 http://gadling.com/2012/06/10/airline-transports-herd-of-african-elephants-photos/ koiulpoi Nice! You matched it. 天地人 Yes, because illegally pirating from huge corperations which constantly attempt to and successfully brainwash people into agenda using various tricks, is somehow bad? You're not supporting the creators of the show, sure. But you're also not supporting the 6 Jewish companies that control 90% of American media. Anyways, with your little money you wouldn't be benefitting anybody. Do you honestly think those Jewish companies are dying to get a hold of your $120 you payed for Netflix this year? Probably not. The creators of the show, are well off anyways. Don't companies pay them to have their content on their platform and pay for their production cost and wages? Then; they've already been payed. I'm not endorsing piracy. It isn't the best thing to do, but I think calling people a "thief" and grouping them with people who have actually stolen things off individuals which mean a lot to the individual and murdered some individuals in the process, is just stupid. It's not the same as 'stealing' bits of 1s and 0s. Again, I'm not endorsing piracy, however there are a lot of good reasons to pirate movies and TV shows. Paul Sterling You're a thief. People leave their families for months to give you works of art. Games, movies, music. You can't throw them a few bucks? I'm legit, always will be. Also, tax helps everyone. Your wall of text is just trying to convince yourself, thief. 天地人 Nope. A thief is different from a pirate, besides, they've already been payed. And I was talking about TV shows and movies, but you're too dense to realise it. jj14x Not the same. If I spend time writing code for software, and decide to sell a monthly license instead of a perpetual license, that is my choice. Your choice should be to either subscribe to the monthly license, or to find a competitor software to use instead. Choosing to bypass the licensing checks makes you a thief (taking something without the owner's permission makes you a thief). And same logic applies to TV shows/movies. If you want to own the movie and watch it whenever you want it, BUY it. "illegally pirating from huge corperations which constantly attempt to and successfully brainwash people into agenda using various tricks, is somehow bad?"<-- YES - it is still illegal. Just because somebody stole your car doesn't mean you can go and steal that person's car in retaliation. There are laws and procedures on how to handle that. STDog Illegal != bad, legal != good. Thousands of unjust laws have been passed. They made actions illegal that were not bad. Richard Markert It's trickle-down, man. Think about if everybody thought like you. Netflix has 100 million subs and each pay at the minimum $107/yr and that's 10.7 billion. Now if that 10.7 billion were wiped out in an instant, how is Netflix going to make new shows or seasons of existing shows? It's the same with the rest of the content creation business. You and me, we're just a drop in the bucket when it comes to their revenue, but instead of scooping it out a spoonful at a time while adding water by the cup, somebody dumped the bucket over, there would be no money left to pay the content creators before content is even made. Railwayman I guess you like DRM and proprietary vendor lock in? The only moral of the story is: Pay for legit services then and watch posted content - the creators get paid and you get proper content without restrictions. The day the industry realize that DRM, geo blocking and so forth are counter productive will be historic. Fedup Love my Moto G5 Plus. Best phone I've had so far - and that's coming from a number of Samsung flagship phones. It's so much snappier and the battery life is insane. I waited a full 48 hours before caving and unlocking/rooting. Haven't looked back. I hate ads, and w/o root, you can't miracast to anything other than chromecast. Trysta Noticed this a little while ago. The crazy thing is I'm not even rooted or interested in any mods. I needed to sideload the latest version 7.1.2 because my RMA Nexus 6p refused to update on its own. I'm keeping the bootloader unlocked so I can recover if my phone boot loops. I rarely use Netflix on my phone but this is kind of annoying. I suspect this has something to do with offline movie watching (which is amazing). jj14x You don't need to unlock bootloader to sideload the full OTA images that Google publishes on their website. Tim Harman But you do need it to recover in your phone bootloops, as he said. jj14x True, but by that logic, everyone should keep their phone's bootloader unlocked all the time (because a bootloop, in theory, could happen to anyone/anytime) - not just when flashing a factory image. EowynCarter You don't ? Had to when installing a developper preview. Then I left it that way, so I won't be locked out in case of boot loop. TedPhillips or when you have some random block on disk get corrupted, ala nexus 9. ilovetesla Dumbest blocking I've ever heard Bruce Wayne I stopped rooting ages ago. Android has gotten so good that I don't need it anymore. Muzzy996 Good for you! Not everyone feels the same though, I know I sure don't. Tasker, Adaway, Greenify, Titanium, Substratum and GMD Gesture Controls are all more important to me than Netflix. The day Netflix stops working on my rooted devices (which are what I watch it on, not my TV) is the day I'll cancel my service. No big loss compared to losing root. Richard Markert Tasker is interesting but never felt the need for it. Adaway, titanium are both irrelevant on my S7, I despise gestures beyond simple swiping in the Cardinal directions, and if stock Android is so perfect why do you need to theme it? C64 I have a s7 edge and the stockrom is full of bloatware from Microsoft, Sansung and Google. More than 20 useless apps are included. So yes the s7 needed root. tim242 Wrong. Package Disabler, no root required. Richard Markert No, it doesn't. Everything not necessary for function is disableable. C64 You can't disable everything Muzzy996 Never said android is perfect, if it was there wouldn't be any competition in the market or users such as myself who feel the need to customize Android. Root is not something I push onto others, its just something that I want on my devices and I make choices about what services I use or devices I purchase based upon my ability to do it. Railwayman I take that you like ads, then? Using a non-rooted Samsung without Taller would be like using a feature phone again but with ads. Having an automated device without ads and bloat is certainly a basic requirement to me. Richard Markert Adhell and Disconnect pro. What's an ad? Railwayman I don't see any ads on my Ericsson GF388 either. Don't have to install a single piece of software in order to get there. Ericsson win, Samsung loose.:) Your Samsung still has Google ad services and so forth running even if you are blocking them on the "non root level". My devices are completely ad free with Google ads disabled system wide and in all apps. Samsung loose every time even if their followers are trying to find different "non root methods" to "solve" things that other devices do without any issues due to... root. kostas110 maybe if you use some 500+ euro smartphone from 2016-2017 something that not everyone can do C64 I disagree, Android is one big advertising if you don't use root. Apps have ads (not every app has a pro version), internet browsing sucks without Adaway (build in ad blockers in browsers aren't great), YouTube really sucks if it isn't modded (watch a 30 second ad for a 3 minute movie). And devices are full of bloatware that can't be removed without root. Even the Google stuff are bloatware (kiosk, movies,music,books etc). I also like to remove alot of system apps and replace them with my own apps that i prefer (file manager, agenda, email, music/ video player) and i really hate duplicate apps on my devices. Also Titanium Backup is important to me. So Android​ without root isn't Android for me. jetscreamer01 I use adguard to block stupid ads in my apps. Now using any commercial apps is enjoyable. Richard Markert Samsung's Internet has the Adblock extension and it literally blocks everything. I also use Disconnect Pro and Adhell for system-wide ad blocking. Titanium Backup I never really used even back when I was rooting phones - it has been replaced 100% by Smart Switch. But then, I haven't needed to restore a backup (except for switching devices) in years, probably because I don't run janky community junkroms. Muzzy996 The only reason you feel that Smart Switch completely replaces Titanium is because you never used other features of Titanium that go beyond what Smart Switch is intended for. Things like shortcuts to freeze/defrost apps, multiple version backups or market management are useful to some even if they're on rooted stock OEM ROMs. They're not must haves for the masses though but some of us do appreciate their usefulness. Cyber_Akuma I hate this response. If anything, I have found far more reasons to root than ever before. Being able to create a backup image and install security/tracking software tat can't just be wiped/uninstalled easily is a big one for example. DJMix I really couldn't understand these kind of stupid moves. I mean I kinda get for an Android Pay or some banking apps to implement these limitations. But seriously, a frickin' streaming app? Afraid they're gonna get pirated? For someone who's going to pirate, they probably could just probably reverse engineer the apk and remove the limitations or basically use older apps. Do they really have some idle engineers that they're forced to implement useless feature? ddevito Guess I'll just pirate it all soon. Their loss. JD Fuck Android If OEMs would fucking provide updates for 5 years I wouldn't need to unlock my bootloader. I'm out. I'll come back when Google fixes this shit. Also fuck Netflix. Back to pirating it is. Christopher Bement My app stopped working on my N7 when I sideloaded 5.0. Got an error when trying to play anything. I went and dropped it back to stock on the latest patch and relocked the bootloader. All working fine now. Too fucking bad, Nougat is fantastic on that device, leaps and bounds better than Marshmallow. tehboogieman Which ROM and which N7 do you have? I still have the stock ROM on my 2013 N7 LTE and have been procrastinating loading an N ROM on it Christopher Bement 2013 LTE version and I was using Nitrogen OS (fantastic and stable ROM). I am now on the latest Marshmallow just so that Netflix will work. tehboogieman As long as I can side load it and sign in I'm still ok. It's a pain, but I'd live with that. But if NF blocks root users from signing in, I'm definitely cancelling and just use one of the very easy pirate apps. Fedup As long as you can side load... Sure. But going from "hidden app in the Play store" to "sideloaded app won't run" is probably on the menu. Wayne Randall I just signed up for Netflix so I could cancel it. I'm part of the group. tim242 You paid them... Richard Markert Hahahahahaha I don't even use Netflix on my phone (screen is too small) so I don't care. But man, the tears and butthurt from the root community is hilarious. Benjamin Walburn You're a very petty child. Richard Markert When something makes me laugh, I point it out. I do that even have a dog in this hunt. I only watch Netflix on my 75" LED TV. I'm just tired of root users smugness. Almost as smug as apple users. Benjamin Walburn You're tired of people being smug in their hobbies, so you gloat about the problems inflicted on them pointlessly? Petty and a hypocrite. Richard Markert What else am I supposed to do to remove the smugness? My name is…. Get a life maybe? Benjamin Walburn Why should you? Is another person's happiness really that painful for you? You already know that they accomplished nothing more than "successfully followed instructions." It seems like your purpose would be better served by targeting that, not just being a jerk. Humbling them is one thing, being an ass is another entirely. tim242 You sound like the petty child. Stomp your foot, becauseyou don't get your way. Benjamin Walburn Not only am I not doing that, I'm not not getting my way, and "stomping​ my foot" is not an example of pettiness. Your wrongness-density is impressive. My name is…. Who beat you as a child? Richard Markert Lol koiulpoi You're on androidpolice.com... making fun of the root community... and unable to see past the end of your nose... Don't you have anything better to do? Richard Markert Actually, no. I read Android police because they have the best coverage of software. koiulpoi I didn't realize I replied to you twice. You're all over this article, with really, nothing better to do, huh? Richard Markert Yeah, I'm bored. I'm probably done stirring shit up anyway, today is water change day on my fish tanks. lomsha Tard Railwayman Are you one of those Samsung Apologists that argue against root and proudly tell everyone about the perfection known as Grace UX... just to install Package Dsabler Pro because... something disturb all "perfectness" of their system? Trying to be an "anti-social elitist" is like proudly use Simple Finder on a Mac and tell everyone that you don't need the regular Finder.;) Richard Markert I use Samsung, but only because it offers the best mix of software and hardware for me. And package disablers are garbage. Railwayman I avoid Samsung like a plague because of Knox 0x1 Warranty Void, Grace UX (TW...) and pretty ugly hardware not to mention the software design, which looks like a cheap toy, both colors, design and all S-This and S-That they preinstall. Don't forget DT Ignite so the carriers can add their share. It is always amusing when the Samsung Apologist proudly claim how good it is to live without root and how "mature Android has become" when they are talking about a heavily modified fork of it. If Samsung could replace Google Play with Galaxy Apps, they would. The only thing restricting them from further modification is the CTS in order to be able to use Play. An unrooted Samsung running Grace? It would be like having a feature phone again. Way too many annoyances and no way of making it more pleasurable since the whole thing is... Samsung. The only area where there are some reminiscence of Android is under the About box. Samsung is a disgrace not to mention a complete parody on the concept of an Android device. Not to mention their followers who recently "spotted" the bezel less display (introduced by Sharp and LG followed by Xiaomi) because... the S 8 got it AND suddenly made it a "requirement". The most kind thing I can say about that brand is this: Samsung is for the Android device and platform what McDonald's is for the thing called food.;) There are way better devices available. Buying a Samsung is like getting a Big Mac (the difference is that the Big Mac buyers doesn't claim its superiority - while Samsung buyers always try to claim how "superior" their devices are). Richard Markert Everything in your first paragraph is purely subjective. I find the design of the Pixel to be ugly, boring and derivative. AOSP design language doesn't appeal to me. I also think Samsung's software suite is better than Google's. My 935U doesn't have DTIgnite, but my 935V does...as does the Verizon branded V20, Moto Turbo2, etc. DTIgnite is a Verizon thing. Bezel less phones are sexy, for sure. That Sharp device was a Sharp device, and the Xiaomi has a CDMA radio so I could use it on Verizon , but just can't justify buying a thousand dollar device from China. It is stupidly gorgeous though. I use Samsung because I like the software design. I like the functionality of the base is and apps, and I like the S-app suite. I really miss my Note 7, and I'll be swapping up to a Note 8 when it's out. Don't get me wrong, Samsung phones have their negatives - chief among them is the fragile design and the screen edge touch rejection sucks ass. But for me, the positives outweigh the negatives. Other phones have bigger negatives for me. No IP68, no uSD card, no wireless charging, no SAMOLED display. Phone preference are always subjective. Somebody will always have a reason to pick one over another. Tell me, if Samsung is a "parody" of the concept of an Android device, what is your description of the perfect Android device? I'm guessing it's the Pixel. Railwayman Pixel is an ugly iPhone clone. The best Android device so far would be something like a Xiaomi Mi Mix running Resurrection Remix or similar ROM or something like a Mi Max but with perfection added through a Snapdragon 835, 256GB storage plus microSDand 6-8GB RAM paired with a 1440p 6.44" display or even 4K. 5000-6000 mAh battery. My Xiaomi Mi Max is excellent but would be even better with the aforementioned hardware (I can't fault is existing hardware but I am taking about a new model). A keyboard flipcover would be a great accessory as well. There are no device yet worthy of the perfect moniker yet but my Max is the best thing so far in my collection beside the Nokia Communicators and HTC TP2 and HD2 and also the Xperia Z Ultra when I do the holistic judgment. IP68? Sony all the way to me if I really insist. MicroSD? No need for a Samsung in order to get it. Yes, Samsung is a kind of a parody of an Android device die to their heavy modifications, restrictive policies, low price /performance ratio, carrier branding and Knox 0x1 Warranty Void. The upcoming OnePlus 5 looks promising - they usually get their things right. MicroSD on that one as well.;) If Samsung make a device without any BS such as restrictions, carrier links paired with good price / performance ratio I would be interested. Let's call it a Note Pro. What I don't like with Samsung are all Apologists making excuses for their policies. I have nothing against them as a company or production. They can make excellent products but their policies stop them right now. It is too much McDonald's mainstream and too little class at this time. Carrier devices are typically too mainstream than the unlocked ones. MadMartigan What are are you, seven? me me A primary reason to root is to run adblock because Google is way too greedy. So the irony, Google's greed means there's less reason to pay for NetFlix. Let me guess... shall we? Google Play Movies still works right...? Oh yes, so long as Google makes their money.... tim242 I block ads with Adguard. No root required. Mike | Homeless On Wheels People still use Netflix? Bit Torrent is your friend. dizel123 Exactly. Everyone should stop using Netflix. Not sure how I'm gonna get the shows i currently watch on Netflix from bit torrent since they won't be made anymore once Netflix is shut down, but at least I'll have my bit torrent friend tim242 Some people like to do things properly. Railwayman You mean - Do it with DRM? You can't buy whatever device you want because a content provider disagree. You can't use the system you want because a content provider disagree. You can't use the app you want because a content provider disagree. I need a lot of apps, ads and limitations for the so called "proper way" . The "improper way" is Samsung free, ad free and bloat free - and I don't need several apps because I have just one or two streaming apps, one media player, one book reader and so on. Fast and efficient system to boot. I think I prefer to do things "improperly". Richard Markert >The "improper way" is Samsung free, ad free and bloat free - and I don't need several apps because I have just one or two streaming apps, one media player, one book reader and so on. Fast and efficient system to boot. *sigh* I bet you think deleting the APKs from /system actually gives you more space in /data, too. Railwayman Perhaps you can tell me the benefit of having Kindle, Kobo and Nook instead of MoonReader for everything. The benefits of having an uprooted system, Netflix, Hulu and a couple of apps for different cable services instead of having just one media center would also be interesting to know more about. When we are at it: Why would I want to use a 3GB+ Samsung ROM when Resurrection Remix are 600 MB and the G-Apps around 340 MB? Richard Markert I dont use any of those. Phones are too small for media consumption. I don't have any video streaming or playback apps on my phone. Nor do I have book readers, but why wouldnt I want Kindle? It's the only way to access the Amazon library... Oh wait, I forgot, you do that believe in compensating content creators. Resurrection remix, really? If I put that on my S7 edge, I'd be wiping out half the hardware's capabilities in one blow. No Samsung pay, no edge panels, no pro mode camera, no AOD, no game tools, no GearVR. And im sure none of the little things I've come to expect in my UI, like direct calling and sliding a contact to call/txt. But I can move the clock to the other side of the notification shade, woohoo! Oh and does the installer for RR rom repartition the file system? Because if not, /system will still be 3gb, not 600mb. And on top of that, I'm immediately reminded of iOS when I looked at their screenshots. Railwayman So RR looks like iOS? Interesting. It looks like Android with Material Design on my device. I buy Kindle books but send them through a plug-in since the Kindle app pretty much suck in comparison with MoonReader. Sometimes I also buy from Google Play Books and it is also a trip through the plug-in for them and then into the MoonReader library. You see - DRM is a stupidity that must go way unless they create a device wide scheme so any app can authenticate and show or play back the content. I understand that Samsung phones are too small for media consumption. A 6.44-7 inch display is different - it works comfortably without the heft of a 10-12 inch tablet. Small displays below 6-6.3 inches are just too small. So your listed features of your Samsung are hardware? They certainly sound like software to me. Or do you seriously believe that Samsung use co-processors in their device like Commodore did on the Amiga? I can assure you that your Samsung contain standard hardware with a lot of subcontracted components, especially in the US market where they even use Qualcomm CPUs. Samsung Pay? Why would I use an OEM dependent payment system? My credit cards follow a standard, why should I pick myself into a specific device OEM just to pay? It makes no sense. It is like having a car that only runs on Citgo gas or a 4" Visa card requiring different terminals than my 4.5" MasterCard. Mobile payments will be a thing when a standard are in place. Payment systems requiring me to lock myself into a specific OEM just suck. Edge panels? Don't see the need. Don't like Edge displays with their optical side effects. Flat display or just slight roundness on the edges like the BlackBerry PRIV here. Pro Mode Camera? I prefer to have the Open Camera API so any app can get RAW from the sensor and do their thing rather than locking myself into the default camera app. I prefer Camera FV-5 or A Better Camera etc. The Snap Camera is good too. Always on display? Can set it up on my device but don't see the need when there are things such as Active Display and a lot of other options. Game tools? I don't see any problems with gaming on other Android versions so I just don't see what Samsung can add in this regard. Gear VR? Why would I want to strap my device to my face when there are dedicated VR headsets available for gaming consoles and computers? I certainly prefer to have a full headset rather than using my device as one. Call features? They could be good but carrier calling is old fashioned. I use Google Voice instead and wouldn't consider going back to carrier talk and text. Don't see any benefit with having a phone number tied to a carrier of SIM card. Having more than one for different purposes on the same device without SIM dependency is the modern way. I don't know if RR repartition Samsung devices so you have to check XDA. That brand is probably the worst when it comes to ROMs anyway and a lot of my dislike of them are related to that particular issue. Samsung is nothing more than the Big Mac of Android devices and no Gear VR or Samsung Pay (it is like having a McDonald's Pay) really change anything. A mainstream device with mainstream design with too many round edges and corners not to say fragile, batteries that wear out fast due to lower quality and fast charge (which stresses the cells heavily), a software design looking "something" , bloat ware, carrier BS such as bloat ware and also the price model, Knox and root/ROM restrictions, locked bootloadern - the list goes on and on. Mainstream degenerated art is what Samsung represents. But I know the existence of people who don't believe in freedom of choice other than the freedom of buying their Samsung from their carrier and then happily oblige and reduction imposed to them all the way down to the SIM card dependent phone number and roaming charges when they travel.;) They also consider Samsung Pay to be the best thing ever - a payment system that only work on a particular OEM. It really is like a car that require Citgo gas and is unable to run on Exxon or Esso fuel. Samsung just are the Big Mac of Android devices. There are just nothing "classy" over such a carrier mainstream brand. If you want to know what luxury are? Look at Vertu. derp_cookies So I agree this is a dumb move but everyone is overreacting by threatening to pirate content. This is a niche problem as less people root now, especially since Android pay won't work when you do it. So Netflix isn't any less accessible than it was before. I watch 99% of Netflix at home on my Roku. Luxferro It's not just rooting. My Nexus 6P is running stock google rom, no root, w/ just unlocked bootloader, and netflix is gone in my play store. Not that I watch TV on my phone... but my shield tv is also unlocked... so it's probably just a matter of time. Roh_Mish Dammit Netflix, you make me want to go popcorn time route. My current primary phone and my iPad are what I use to watch netflix and both of them is stock so i don't have anything to worry about but this just feels wrong. Between this and Amazon not releasing the TV app for my sony TV, which they support outside, popcorn time (and in extension piracy) just seems easier. Vivek Rameses This is why we have piracy. Miguel Angel But ...why? occono Distributors want Netflix to stop any possibility of making DRM-Free backups on the content. Railwayman Good luck with that. If it can be played, it can be recorded. As long as the Netflix content is visible somewhere a copy can be recorded so again, good luck with blocking. Mariano Moreira Even more strange is while Netflix app is removed from Playstore, Netflix VR is still.in Playstore. Manually flashing Factory Image for Google Pixel is how I get me OS updates and I choose to leave bootloader unlocked, rather than relocking every month.(which would include full wipe) So I guess they don't care about security for the few users whom might use Netflix VR with Daydream compatible device? tehboogieman I'm not familiar with the Pixel, but almost every Nexus device lets you lock without wiping all your data. Maybe that requires root though, I really don't understand the details on how it works, but hopefully you can find a way to do it. Mariano Moreira To clarify: In order for me to install Factory Image every month, I need to have Bootloader unlocked. Doing the Factory unlock will wipe the device. Locking the device doesn't wipe the device, but Factory unlocking the bootloader will wipe the device. tehboogieman Yeah, sorry I wasn't more specific. I use an app called BootUnlocker. It lets you lock and unlock the bootloader without wiping at will. Since an app can do this, I'm assuming that it can be done via ADB. Also it might only work on older devices, but maybe there's a way to replicate this action on newer devices as well Mariano Moreira I don't understand why Google is promoting Security by having the device fully-locked, yet still relies on ADB fastboot unlock/OEM Unlock commands to flash factory images? saf1927 Why are using factory images when Google provides OTA images too, and these don't require an unlocked bootloader, nor a wipe? jdrch It's not just Netflix. The HDHomeRun Prime app doesn't work on rooted 7.0+ devices either. Jsilvermist Good to know, will no longer recommend Netflix to anyone when I'm asked... James F News flash: when you explain to most normal people why you don't recommend Netflix, they won't care, because it doesn't affect them. D13H4RD2L1V3 This is stupid. I had to root my phone to be able to hide the navbar at any time I want and also to gain better battery management controls and other stuff that I sorely wished Google had added to stock Android way sooner. And I was considering a Netflix subscription. No longer...... Sruly J I know it's not fully a solution which is "worth it", but the app Custom Navigation Bar offers the ability to hide status bar/narbar without root. Although like you said, you had other reasons to root, so... Diar I pay for Netflix so I can watch the content any way I want guilt free, whether that's their app or other locations on the Internet. F their VPN blocking and DRM. If they make their app impossible to use, I just won't use it. They'll still get my money but they will lose any data/tracking since I'll still be watching their shows, just outside of their ecosystem. Dummies. ReedSolomon Between the SJW nonsense like Bill Nye, the ipv6 tunnel blocking (rather than simply defaulting to ipv4), increases in price, less and less quality content, and now this, I see little reason to keep paying for Netflix. robogo I understand Netflix' reasons, I really do - they need to protect their property and investment. But I can't really say I understand the way they're doing this. This is a good way to alienate the small percentage of power users who root their devices for various, but perfectly valid and understandable reasons. And no, this will not make me cancel my membership as long as the app works. Cancelling membership is a silly, overblown reaction to what is, in my mind, a minor nuisance. D13H4RD2L1V3 I personally just find it a dumb move. Seems like an easy way out. Dmitri Smirnov > perfectly valid and understandable reasons. And what reason would that be? Preventing people from ripping their content? Doesn't stop them in the slightest, root-detection in circumvented rather easily as well as safety net, we have PokemonGo to thank for that - a lot of people were motivated to crack it and they succeeded. > Cancelling membership is a silly, overblown reaction to what is, in my mind, a minor nuisance. Cancelling membership is valid form of feedback to the company, that trying to tell it's customers that they are not allowed to own their device that they paid their money for, if they want to watch a movie. robogo You misunderstood, it seems. A perfectly valid and understandable reason to root one's device would be, e.g. Xposed framework, theming support, tethering, backing up stuff with Titanium Backup, etc. Please read my comment once again. EowynCarter Well, if and when it stops working on my phone, what will be a major nuisance. robogo Agreed. I'll have to find another way then. But I'll deal with that when the time comes. Manbearpig I member when netflix released there app for Android and they did the same thing. I would just download the app and be good to go. After awhile though I stop rooting I miss it sometimes Cyber_Akuma I warned people when Pokemon GO of all things had a surprise update that silently added SafetyNet that this garbage was going to become more and more common. Mario RUN uses it too, and now Netflix.... soon apps everywhere are going to add SafetyNet and block rooted devices as standard practice. Google has been incredibly hostile towards people who actually want to own or have control over their devices or even their PC Software over the last few years. And over the last year google has been making SafetyNet more and more harsh, now even tripping if your BOOTLOADER is unlocked even if your phone is not rooted. Pokemon GO and Mario RUN were a small crowd, but I hope after Netflix of all things starts using it (and make no mistake, this is just the beginning) that people will finally push back against Google's hostility towards rooted users. EowynCarter Yeah. Or I might seriously consider going the iOS way. Though iOS would pose other problems. (Bye paylib) BillPosters I rooted my Android phone to get rid of the annoying camera shutter sound, and to prevent apps from stealing my contacts, and to basically take control of my device rather than letting Google run the whole show, and because of that I can't update Netflix? Good riddance Netflix. iKon I'm pretty sure you can go in the camera settings and take of the camera shutter sound?.... .. In some region-specific firmware versions or certain devices you can't do that. Railwayman There is a better solution: Declare the device a DRM free zone and use everything else. DRM to me is "Don't Restrict Me!" and an excellent reason to give certain companies the middle finger telling them to just go and F themselves. The most ironic thing here is that removing Netflix or using DRM otherwise doesn't stop piracy. On the contrary - By buying and using DRM content you get to travel in the cargo hold with no heating while the pirating consumer get first class service: more content, no restrictions, no copyright trailers or ads before the movie start and stop on. Even better: They can use whatever apps or ROMs they want. Would I unroot my device in order to get DRM content onboard? No way!!! If Netflix are so scared - block the client on Mac OS X and Windows et al. Piracy doesn't usually happen with an Android device as a source but rather computers and HDCP rippers. Another thing also to the DRM companies: Everything that can be played back can be recorded! (Good old piracy saying) Netflix out, Fusion with Exodus, SALTS and Phoenix in. Kodi with Rapier skin is much nicer than the Netflix client and Trakt integration make this way a much better one than going down the DRM route, sitting with an uprooted stock ROM and Netflix.;) TechJunkie198 ? netflix isn't scared. the studios require the drm. and netflix isn't concerned with the small percent of users who root their devices. Railwayman Doesn't matter. Go and enjoy your DRM services.;) DRM is a pest and that is why the pirating community offer a superior product. It is easier and more hassle free to just put Netflix where they belong and use Exodus et al or MovieBox or Terrarium TV and so on. To those who now consider unrooting because of Netflix: Just don't - use other services instead. Richard Markert So when everybody takes your advice and uses a service that doesn't compensate anybody in the content creation business, and all the high-quality media is gone, don't go crying about there being nothing good to steal anymore, k? Railwayman Even better: DRM and proprietary vendor lock in are scrapped and replaced by standards. If they want some kind of protection - make it device wide and linked to the account signed in so playback works in different apps - only thing needed is to call the system wide authentication system. I am against DRM and vendor restrictions. Original content without any of the BS is what the world need. Piracy is a symptom of several problematic things such as geo restrictions, root restrictions and the failed idea of the "right of no distribution" - i.e. the content exist but stubborn companies deny distribution using silly arguments. I always remove DRM from purchased content in order to have full control including the basic right of using whatever app or equipment for playback. Richard Markert Start developing the solution, and start a content creation company that can compete with the big boys when it comes to quality content. Or, you can sit around and whine online about the content creators not wanting the people who don't follow rules to play in their gated sandbox and get mad when you crawl over the fence. Railwayman I take that you like DRM and proprietary vendor lock-in. It is easy to avoid the gated sandbox so no need to whine. It is easier to just fire up Exodus rather than relocking the bootloader and flashing a stock ROM or remove SuperSU in favor of Magisk just to be able to get Netflix. DRM is such a waste of time. It's not necessary to develop a new service since the content are available DRM free already. Standards for media and books etc does exist or did you miss EPUB, PDF, AAC, MP3, MP4 and so on? Perhaps you prefer such a format as ZNO or Apple modified EPUB that only works with iBooks? saf1927 Magisk seems to do the trick. Helios What about my non-rooted OnePlus One? It's also listed as incompatible.. '-_- 天地人 Don't OnePlus devices run a custom ROM and have unlocked bootloaders? Android Developer How can they block people who root the device from installing the app? The play store doesn't have this filter. Maybe after the install they do this check? Richard Markert If you're really an Android Developer, you would know that SafetyNet is what's doing this "behind the scenes". Android Developer I'm talking about the article. They say that Netflix blocks rooted devices, and I know that this isn't an option on the developer console. Google doesn't have anything related to rooted devices there. Ezio I have about 200 original blu-ray disks, go to cinema, and I'm Netflix subscriber. Now I won't get app updates (or even worse I won't be able to use it in the future) just because I like to use my custom rom. Thank you. This is really a bad move. AdjustedFlow I thought netflix was about providing a better service than piracy. Now they're literally pushing me back to piracy. What the heck? Dany If for "root" they mean administrator privileges, don't we already have that on windows 10? So why Netflix doesn't block desktop version too? P.S. by the way...whatever man! I was using Kodi more than this crap anyway... Miku is Best Vocaloid This means Netflix won't be getting my business anymore. Paul Sterling No worries here, when you're legit. Take my money, I'm not cheap. Give me a service, I'll pay you. I don't need to rob. What am I? 13 living with my mom using Napster? Naw, grew up. Don't have any Tim foil hats. My wallet grew up too. ast00 This is a dick move that could have been avoided. If they want us to pirate their content instead, we will pirate their content. We tried doing it the legal way, but they didn't allow it. Their problem, not ours. EowynCarter Umf. **checks google play ** No longer compatible with my nexus 6 . But nexus 4 still ok. For crying out loud! I'm not rooted or using a custom ROM. Pyramid Power netflix is just losing money. it's saying to those people, 'go to thepiratebay!' RemiV2 I guess I'll just keep torrenting then. Thanks, Netflix.

Netflix is a client app. If I can, with a rooted phone, fake my subscription, or somehow cause a major security issue, that is not a problem with me, that is a problem with you pushing out a vulnerable app to millions of users. Sure, it would be my fault for exploiting it, but there is no-one but you who managed to put the problem in place. A CLIENT app should not be anything but a front-end representation of an API run by your servers. The CLIENT should have nothing but a CLIENT ID to use with the API. The CLIENT should NOT be able to change JACK SHIT with the API, it should only be able to get search results, get access to encrypted streams, etc. If your client CAN change JACK SHIT (which one could assume is true, since you are so actively hiding your code) then you have a major security vulnerability... This is a problem with your code, not anyone's rooted device... Hell, you don't even need a rooted device to access the applications code, just download an APK of the app, extract it, and decompile it... Jesus netflix, get your shit straight you bendy pos... BahnStormer Netflix is used more on tablets and TV boxes, these tend to be used for several years longer than phones and even Google now only updates their devices for <2 years (Samsung / streamer manufacturer's do this even less!)... We HAVE to run the likes of Lineage if we want the devices to be secure! Bye bye Netflix, even Amazon Video lets us use rooted devices! jcopernicus People don't understand IP and lambast a company protecting it. Of course. RemixedCat well they got rid of 5 star ratings, deleted tons of shows I was in the middle of, and the roku app is hella slow and takes 10 freakin minutes to load (by comparison my OS install from power on to desktop was 8 minutes on my samsung 850 500GB SSD!!) Tobi I'm running LineageOS on my Oneplus One to lengthen the lifespan of my device. Why must I be punished for that? I'm going back to pirating content. StankyChikin Possible that the movie industry is pushing this? SkullOne Shhhhh. Don't use logic here. It's not allowed. It's simply easier to blame Netflix and believe that they have a vendetta against the teeny tiny, itsy bitsy amount of root users out there! StankyChikin Forgive me plz lol username_not_valid This isnt about Netflix, its about its content providers. There is this notion that you can copy files and therefore pirate content if you are rooted. We all know its rubbish, Netflix probably knows its rubbish, but that doesn't change anything. If Netflix wants shows, its has to abide by its license agreements. There is really nothing Netflix, Amazon, Sky or any other streaming service can do about it. The fact that almost all pirate content comes from PCs and HDCP by-pass devices doesnt mean a thing. TedPhillips at least in practice, unlocking your bootloader/being rooted has no impact on your widevine support level. now, i'm not sure if the oem could supply a high-level drm library on a pre-rooted device, due to agreements, but modification after the point of sale is a different matter. meanwhile, keep on streaming netflix on your 'rooted' computer - gasp!~ Richard Markert >meanwhile, keep on streaming netflix on your 'rooted' computer - gasp!~ I don't even need an admin account to steal Netflix on my PC. Since the Windows 10 app and browsers BOTH work over analog, all I need is an inline box with a DSUB VGA connector and simply capture the entire output from the VGA port. Valerie Frye-Preter Did they do this because of the stolen season 5 of Orange is the New Black? TedPhillips wasn't that stolen before it was available for streaming? so i don't see how it could be. TedPhillips when the device can be retroactively uncertified, as safetynet mutates over time, that's a step beyond the usual forced obsolescence of artificially short software support windows. now instead of buying a new phone every 18-24 months, it could be literally whenever they feel like moving the goalposts. Mike Hunt I don't understand. I am a Netflix subscriber, but will probably have to unsubscribe now since I bought a rooted Chinese mediabox for my TV. This sucks, as I liked and supported NetFlix's business model. Richard Markert Which box do you have? Mike Hunt One of these https://www.aliexpress.com/wholesale?catId=0&initiative_id=SB_20170514131212&SearchText=media+box+mini+m8s Brock Reed I'm not even getting the "not compatible" message, it's just not showing up at all. Ajmobileguru First DirecTV Now and now Netflix. I dont see the point. As if rooted users were pirating the streams or movies. Rooted users on non-nexus/pixel devices already were getting only 480p because of widewine crap and now this. Anunnaki This is why people switch to apps like Popcorn Time and Terrarium TV. Biga173rd Popcorn time still works? Anunnaki When I last checked few months ago, it was working. No idea about the current situation though. Biga173rd Okay Erin Andrews Oh that's easy, they block my device I cancel my subscription. Say goodbye to my 15 dollars a month. piggynuts Stopped playing Pokemon, stopped using Snapchat, next to go is Netflix. I refuse to say bye to root. BobButtons Magisk. While some say it's hit and miss with Pokemon GO (idk, I don't play it) it's never not worked for me with Snapchat/Android Pay/Mario Run. cliff_dangers Why does everyone freak out about a rooted phone but my PC which is wide open is not a problem? What makes smartphones so special? Doro Manekia ΝετΦλξ Ανάθεμα σου.Χα χα χα Το Μαααακα. Bewear I am not that upset because I rarely use Netflix on my mobile, I am upset because this kind of blocking will become a trend. BoFiS ugh, fuck you, Netflix, I pay for your serve, LET ME USE IT ON MY PHONE A.M There are some many ways around that LAME NETFLIX - Showbox Kodi Firestick with Kodi I can't see the point of Netflix when we have so MANY better apps out there that kill Netflix ErectBipedal That'll teach them filthy pirates for trying to pay us money!.... wait.... -Netflix probably Zxyon Rhysivz What could users with unlocked/rooted phones do with the Netflix app that other users can't? Loco Mole Netflix content isn't that much better these days, so if they choose to distinguish themselves by being a d*ck to consumers who care about using our devices the way we want to, then f u too, Netflix, I got plenty of other legit streaming content. Fedup Let's see... Piracy: $0.00, no ads, no DRM, no device/location/time restrictions Legit: $$$, ads out the as$, DRM limiting options, shows locked to specific devices, locations, etc. Keep on making the decision easier for us, Netflix. xyz Fortunately, the Pirate Bay is accessible from all devices and regions without any geo-blocking. berserksgangr Well, my Nexus 7 with Lineage it's not working even without root (error 9) Nick Riley This is utterly stupid! Corvus Dove Remember that time that making things more difficult for software and media pirates through DRM while possibly messing with legitimate customers paid off and prevented piracy? Me either. Asbjørn The problem here is that most users root their phone to get the updates that their OEM doesn't want to make available. If Android had proper updates, rooting would not be so necessary. Patel Nisha Root user here. How do I use Magisk for this? I have it installed and new to the Magisk(haven't had a rooted phone in a while)? Keletor Does it stop you from sideloading it? I mean really, if you are rooting your phone you most likely will find a workaround. Luxferro Not yet, but you can be sure the app will stop working in the future. Znuff The download feature is not working for me anymore. And the 5.x app is not working at all, just says I need to install the 4.x one (redirects me to the download page) Tim Get Roku tv or a fire stick cause no issues there and it isn't through Google then Biga173rd People still use Netflix? mlauzon And this is exactly how you piss off your end users! Doug Rogers I guess I'll have to unroot - whoops, Android 4.2 Awesome. Luxferro Don't forget to leave your 1 star review. Links to both apps (Android TV and the normal Android app) https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.netflix.mediaclient&hl=en&rdid=com.netflix.mediaclient https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.netflix.ninja&rdid=com.netflix.ninja Yoda’s Spirit Seems they keep cracking down on anything Open internet related! The only way I can watch overseas now is using Mediahint.com - nothing else works. Luxferro Just use usenet. They are forcing their legit customers to piracy... DDS This move will not stop people from pirating their content, it will encourage it. Exactly the opposite of what they're trying to achieve. But tell that to the a**hats who control the money... Ubelsteiner And thus, Plex and Kodi become even more popular, as Netflix drives a nail into it's own coffin. Znuff http://i.imgur.com/LG3dXc4.jpg http://i.imgur.com/eNeuPCD.jpg Can not use the latest version on my device, it sends me to download the 4.x version. When I try that, the latest 4.x version has Downloads disabled for me (it used to work on this device). US Patriot No worries. I can live without Netflix, but I will NOT live without full control of my devices and data. Ricardo A. Fragoso For those who want root at all cost there's still a chance to get movies with ChromeCast Support... Google "TerrariumTV". :D You are welcome. :D Sir Doogie Houser M.D.Esq. 200 Mobile devices are now a vice.The rules,whether stringent or lenient,if there's demand,the market will fill the demand.Plain and simple.So to Mr.Gable,your wrong buttercup. Nick Coad I can guarantee you that Netflix doesn't make these choices willingly. The production companies they purchase shows off are notoriously backward when it comes to technology and unfortunately Netflix relies on them to survive.

The two California firms have agreed to work together on pilot projects with the aim of making mainstream self-driving technology.  The move will escalate tensions between Google and Uber, who have been fighting a bitter lawsuit over the systems behind their autonomous cars.  Google's Waymo, which has been trialling driverless minivans in Phoenix, said the deal will help it expand its tests.  "Lyft's vision and commitment to improving the way cities move will help Waymo's self-driving technology reach more people in more places," said Waymo.  The big players | Driverless cars Working with Lyft will give the technology giant access to swathes of data, while the ride-hailing app will be eager to join the autonomous vehicle battle with a powerful ally.  "Waymo holds today's best self-driving technology, and collaborating with them will accelerate our shared vision of improving lives with the world's best transportation," said Lyft.  The tie-up comes as a blow to Uber, which has hit multiple roadblocks in its autonomous vehicle ambitions. Uber is fighting a lawsuit against Google over its driverless technology. Google is suing Uber for allegedly stealing the technology behind its self-driving vehicles.  Since the proceedings began, the head of Uber's self-driving division and former Google employee Anthony Levandowski has stepped aside. Sherif Markaby also resigned as the company's vice president of global vehicle programs.  The embattled ride-hailing app is separately facing a criminal investigation by the US Government over the secret "Greyball" technology that it is accused of using to evade regulators.  Share this article Follow Telegraph Science & Tech Follow on Facebook Follow on Twitter Follow on Instagram Follow on Pinterest View comments If you would like to add a comment, please register or log in Register Log in Please review our commenting policy Follow Telegraph Science & Tech Follow on Facebook Follow on Twitter Follow on Instagram Follow on Pinterest Related Topics Google Driverless cars Self driving cars Uber Show more Technology latest 00:47 16 May 2017, 8:02am 'I'm no hero', says IT expert Marcus Hutchins who saved the world from ransomware virus 16 May 2017, 8:00am 'Best clue yet' links North Korea to global cyber attack 16 May 2017, 6:24am Australia considering laptop ban on international flights 16 May 2017, 12:01am AI traffic lights to end rush hour jams in Milton Keynes 15 May 2017, 8:21pm Comment: Why the  biggest tech revolution will start  in your kitchen Matthew Lynn Premium 15 May 2017, 7:01pm Creators of the MP3 declare it dead 15 May 2017, 6:09pm Cyber attack: Latest evidence indicates 'phishing' emails not to blame for global hack Gallery 15 May 2017, 5:01pm Gallery: E3 2017: The games lineup we most want to see 15 May 2017, 4:48pm Suspicious emails 'unlikely to be cause' of global cyber attack - so what caused it?  15 May 2017, 3:16pm How to protect yourself from ransomware 01:33 15 May 2017, 12:59pm What is WannaCry and how does ransomware work? 15 May 2017, 11:05am Prey review - A hostile, exciting and smart sci-fi adventure 4 15 May 2017, 9:26am Microsoft slams US government over global cyber attack 15 May 2017, 7:58am Comment: It's time to smarten up our act in the fight against cybercrime Juliet Samuel Premium 15 May 2017, 6:00am Comment: The dotcom bubble? this time it really is different Tom Stevenson Premium 15 May 2017, 5:53am Japan and China wake up to global 'ransomware' cyberattack while Microsoft slams US government  15 May 2017, 5:01am Google promises stricter control over advertising network 14 May 2017, 7:13pm ARM revenues jump as SoftBank prepares tech fund launch 14 May 2017, 5:44pm Comment: SoftBank's Masayoshi Son is the type of investor British tech needs James Titcomb Premium 01:33 14 May 2017, 5:26pm Cyber attack: ransomware explained 13 May 2017, 6:36am Taiwan on alert amid fears it could be hit with second wave of global cyber attack Contact us Rewards Archive Reader Prints Advertising Syndication Guidelines Privacy Terms and Conditions Leave your feedback © Telegraph Media Group Limited 2017 We've noticed you're adblocking.

Now, it seems that Google is planning another expansion, with a potential debut on Apple’s iOS. Samsung Chromebook Plus According to Android Police, Google is planning to announce that Assistant is making its way to iOS, with an announcement potentially coming as soon as Google I/O this week. That would certainly be the most fitting place to make this announcement, but it’s unclear what Google has in mind as timeframes are pretty unclear. Assistant on iOS will launch in the US only at first and will adopt a slightly different style compared to what we’ve seen to date. Apparently, the iOS version of the service will have the same voice-controls found on Android, but will also use the chat-style which is currently found in its Allo messaging app. It seems likely due to this, at least to me, that Assistant on iOS will be its own app, not just an extension of one of Google’s current offerings on the platform. While this move may not make sense for Google at first glance, it does in the bigger picture. Google just launched the Assistant SDK to enable developers to use Assistant on their own devices, and the “Actions on Google” platform continues to expand as well. By bringing Assistant to Android’s main competitor in the smartphone market, developers will have further incentive to develop for it, seeing that just about everyone will have access to it in one way or another.

Google will announce Assistant for iOS soon, in the US only at launch David Ruddock Follow View All Posts 2017/05/15 7:28am PDTMay 15, 2017 101 Plus 1 on G+ 217 Share on Facebook 140 Share on Twitter Total Shares458 Applications Exclusives News Rumors According to a trusted source, Google plans to announce that the Google Assistant will be launching on iOS soon as a standalone app. The announcement could come as soon as Google's I/O conference this week, but it's unclear exactly what Google's plans are at this time. The app would likely feature a blend of the "chat" style functionality in the Google Allo version of Assistant and the voice-controlled version found on Android, but again, details are scant. We do know that the Assistant for iOS will only be available in the US at launch, and that Google plans to make the announcement in fairly short order. I/O would be a pretty ideal venue for such a launch, as Assistant's SDK was just made available to developers late last month. Bringing the Assistant to the world's second-largest mobile OS would likely encourage more developers to integrate with the app's functionality. As we learn more about this story, we'll bring it to you. For now, just know that Assistant on iOS is imminent. While we are labeling this story a "rumor" because we don't know what Google's exact timeframe for announcing this news is, we're highly confident that the information we were provided is accurate.

Martin You are wrong. Beta is on Android. We test it, then they release it better working on iOS... We keep testing... :-)) Bewear Sad, but true. JD Correction. Google services is always beta. When something is about to Go Gold they shut it down and offer 3 competing products. Because Fuck you that's why. - Google. Filipe Santos You won! King_Android Naw, iOS users would have the first Alpha version of GA while we wait for the rollout to hit our Android devices. Maxwell “Max” Weinbach I have had it for months. S7 Edge and Nexus 6P ADofCLE He's referring to the typical release of Google services. He was being sarcastic. rohiggidy google now/voice search is on IOS. We all expected this MaximumFish "In the US only at launch". Isn't that *still* the case for the Android version? No-one I know if the UK has got it yet, except Pixel users obviously. I've given up checking for it now. Winston Indonesian here. ALL of my devices have it. Since 2 months ago or so. krazyfrog Got it from the day they announced. You probably just need to clear your Google Play services cache or change device language to English US. Alex Yes, I believe that changing the device language to "English US" works, but that's pretty much stating that it's still US only, as you have to pretend to be from US. Shahin Just adding it as a second option works, provided you setup Assistant with US only first. That way you don't have to deal with US Englizh. MaximumFish Thinking about it, I get the sneaky suspicion that I don't have it due to having a Google Apps account. I wish they'd offer a route to migrate from Apps to a standard account. Hyperionite Indonesian here. Using English US as my default language. My device have it. Running Android 6 at the moment Latheryin Won't mean much as Apple will still leverage the use of its own over Google. Heck most android users don't use it what makes them think iPhone users will. Martin Because Google are dumb ducks... I use it, but would use it a lot more, if they make it again to Wake up the assistant from the lock screen on any device... Miss so much from my iPhone being able to say "Hey Siri" and set alarm/timer/call even without touching my phone... And not everyone wants to use Pixel phones... :) David Slawotsky Use Trusted Voice in Settings. That will allow you. Martin I guess this is only for Pixel phones. I don't have this in my settings :) Alex Trusted Voice is part of Google's Smart Lock -- it's not just for Pixel. On my stock Galaxy S7, it's under Settings > Lock screen and security > Secure lock settings > Smart Lock Latheryin To be honest I have it on my nexus and never use. It just not something I need. Let alone want to broadcast what I am doing to every one around me. It is almost as bad as people talking on speaker phone in public. Martin It's personal thing. Some will use it, some wont.. :-)) Latheryin I, see a lot less people wanting to use it on IOS. Won't be enough integration when compared. To siri. To be honest they should just keep the AI on the platform they were made for. We all saw how Apple music did on Android. AbbyZFresh Your point. Apple has Siri and Spotlight embedded in their phone and yet the Google search app is one of the most downloaded in the App Store. Latheryin Those numbers seldom mean real downloads and use. Things like download counts and reviews are seldom accurate with places selling downloads and reviews for really cheap Leandro Brandão I wish I could replace Siri with google assistant. Julie Ankrom I don't want either one. I just want "OK google" and doing a search directly, or giving orders directly. I played with Google Assistant for a while and it just adds a middleman. Leandro Brandão I never used assistant, I thought it was a better ok google. Google app always understands me and give me correct answers. JD If anything it's a worse Google Now. but it speaks more naturally? So I guess that's a good thing? I don't even fucking know anymore. OligarchyAmbulance Assistant is activated with "Ok, Google" and does what you are asking for. In what way is it worse or a "middle man" to Google Now (which it replaced)? destinyhud right when i am trying to replace my ipad with Chromebook detachable. i have hopes for Chromebook C2 at IO SupahNin10doh Thank bliming bob! I hate Siri sooo much. SupahNin10doh Now if they'd also bring it to MacOS Ghostx7x And then to Windows 10 Leonardo Baez Soooo I'm on Nexus 6P and have no assistant yet, but iphone is getting it? Outrageous Cat Astrophy http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/03/02/google-assistant-coming-android-6-0-devices/ If your phone doesn't have it blame your cell provider, not Google. Filipe Santos You have if you choose the supported languages, otherwise no. I changed but if you have your second language, your native language messages will be spoken so damn bad you can't understand or speak sh*t RickJ How does Google expect anyone to want switch from​ iPhone to their phone when they​ keep giving everything away to Apple for free? Keep some things to yourself, Google! Some exclusive incentives for them to switch. Adam Margeson Google doesn't care about switching people to Android. They only care about getting customer data. They can sort-of do that if they keep getting their apps over to iOS. And then provide subtle hints that "Android integrates all of this to make things easier... if you care to switch over." (Not to say that they do integrate things better... just look at the Assistant-on-different-devices fiasco) lauski I'd agree they don't care AS MUCH, but they do care to some degree... Look, they officially have entered the hardware business with the pixels. Right now you're right-- whatever sales they might marginalize are far outweighed by marketing dollars and customer info. The opposite is true for Apple, which is why we won't be enjoying an official iMessage and Facetime release on the Play Store any time soon... Zach Mauch I might at the "[Exclusive]" to this just so i is obvious that it is info from AP. Artem Russakovskii "I might at the "[Exclusive]" to this just so i is obvious that it is info from AP." A little attention when typing? Régis Knechtel https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/b02bffe886fcaf1c5490199c0b7fa03f201960050d66218052c281973c4f9283.gif ADofCLE I knew this was coming. They always release their products on iOS. Even though it really doesn't do anything Google Now already does. Cakefish I haven't even got it on my non-Pixel UK Android phone yet. DragoCubed Surprised yet not surprised they did this. I just wished they'd keep some more android exclusives. Nicholas C YES! I am 95% google here but have an iPhone after the whole Note7 shitstorm JD Too bad you still can't use a default assistant other than Siri. I would totally use Google Now if I could. Fucking Hate Siri that useless hunk of code. Filipe Santos Google stop being an a$$hole, why the hell you release an iOS app if you don't even release on the rest of the languages first or countries? Do you only care about profit? Damn ****** ..... jawsnnn Off topic... It was reported months ago that GA was rolling out to Nexus devices. Is that still happening? Does anyone know? Dave Cremin Lol and I haven't even got it in my 6P. Ridiculous. Brad Wilson I put the Google app on my home screen, because it's so much better than Siri. It's worth the extra step to press the button. I hope that Google assistant becomes better than what I'm using now. Premsuraj Can someone explain to me why the Voice Actions on Google Now can work with a lot of languages including hotword support, but Google Assistant only works with US & UK English? Shouldn't the voice detection be a separate component that can work with any voice assistant? Or atleast they should be able to easily reuse the current implementation Teja I got Assistant on my Oneplus 3 few weeks back, I resetted my device few days back and its gone. Its been 5 days and I'm still waiting to see it. Can anyone help? mike shwilly Ok Google, what is this song?

Netflix confirms it is blocking rooted/unlocked devices, app itself is still working (for now) Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/13 3:08pm PDTMay 13, 2017 229 Plus 1 on G+ 1077 Share on Facebook 394 Share on Twitter Total Shares1700 Applications News Earlier today, Netflix started showing up as 'incompatible' on the Play Store for rooted and unlocked Android devices. However, the app itself continued to work fine, leading some (including myself) to think it could have been an accident. However, Netflix has now confirmed to us that blocking modified devices from downloading the app was intentional. This is the full statement: With our latest 5.0 release, we now fully rely on the Widevine DRM provided by Google; therefore, many devices that are not Google-certified or have been altered will no longer work with our latest app and those users will no longer see the Netflix app in the Play Store. If you're not familiar with it, Widevine is a Google-made DRM technology that works across various desktop and mobile platforms. Widevine categorizes devices into three security levels, ranging from all processes running in the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) to not running anything in TEE at all. However, the Play Store listing seems tied to a device's SaftetyNet status (which is used by Android Pay), rather than the Widevine TEE. For example, Artem's bootloader-unlocked stock Pixel is still on Widevine Level 1, the most secure level, but fails SafetyNet because it is unlocked. The update's changelog also confirms the: "Version 5.0 only works with devices that are certified by Google and meet all Android requirements." What isn't exactly clear is why only the Play store listing is blocked, but the app itself continued to function normally. I tried both Netflix 4.16 and 5.0.4 (the latest version, from today), and both worked without problems on my unlocked and rooted Galaxy Tab S (which is labeled as Widevine Security Level 3). Maybe at some point the app will stop working, but that does not appear to be the case right now. If you have a blocked device, I recommend following the Pushbullet channel for Netflix on APKMirror (click the Pushbullet button on that page) so you can continue to receive updates outside the Play Store.

First the vpn's now this... why oh why??? Jimk4003 Surely because licensing is regionally specific, and because rooting has the potential to defeat DRM. I get that it might be annoying for some people, but aren't the reasons obvious? David Juarez But root?? Lol Semianonymous Probably an effort to reduce Region spoofing? Idk how easy that is to do on a stock device. Jimk4003 Because rooting has the potential to defeat DRM. mjh49783ab DRM doesn't work. All DRM does is inconvenience the end user. Jimk4003 Possibly. But Netflix have to negotiate licencing deals with the movie studios, and having DRM helps reassure the studios that the movies they have spent millions of dollars making aren't going to get stolen off Netflix without any attempt to stop it. mjh49783ab One could make the argument that rooting the phone may compromise the DRM. But blocking users from unlocking their phones to switch carriers? That is total bullshit, and is just the sort of thing that encourages users to pirate the content. Jimk4003 Netflix are blocking you from switching carriers? lomsha Sim unlocked phones are fine, unlocked bootloaders are blocked. mjh49783ab They didn't exactly make that clear in the article when I last read it. h4rr4r The studios need to reconsider blu rays then. Way easier to rip. Nothing they do will stop piracy. This kind of thing actually encourages it. Jimk4003 Maybe studios do need to consider Blu-ray's. That isn't Netflix's problem though. h4rr4r No Netflix problem is making sure they don't let the studios reduce the value of their product. If Amazon video works on my devices and Netflix does not that is a big deal to me. In that case I might as well sign up for more addon channels on Amazon with the mkney that currently goes to Netflix. Jimk4003 Agreed. But the studios are responsible for making the product they redistribute. It's certainly a balancing act, and I can see both sides of the argument, but Netflix isn't an inalienable right, and those who don't meet the T&C's are going to miss out. h4rr4r Sure, but the studios and Netflix are going to create pirates with these kind of actions. People aren't going to miss out. They will just pirate what they can't get legally. Jimk4003 Sure, but again, it's a tiny fraction of users. If Netflix can negotiate better terms with studios by blocking rooted devices, and thus improve their business overall at the expense of a few fringe users, it stands to reason that is what Netflix will do. Doby Gillis whaa fucking whaa. Sergio Carmona The only obvious thing here is your sarcasm detector not working properly. Go have it fixed please. Jimk4003 Nah, I'm good. h4rr4r So the reason are to make the product worse for the consumer. Great idea, now piracy looks better and better. Jimk4003 What percentage of phones are rooted though? Most people won't care, or even notice the change. h4rr4r It does not matter, if it drives even one person to piracy that is a loss. Jimk4003 But if they can ensure better licensing deals via these new terms, which will attract more customers at the expense of a few rooted users who make up a tiny fraction of overall users; will Netflix care about that loss? h4rr4r But if it encourages piracy the other side of the contract should want to avoid it. Gaining customers in the short term like this hurts the whole market in the long term. Cyber_Akuma Because yeah, people are going to rip movies from Netflix and not off a Blu-Ray.... and even IF they were to attempt to rip them off Netflix, they would use a PHONE and not a PC.... Jimk4003 Ripping Blu-rays isn't Netflix's problem, and Netflix don't need to try and guess what device someone would try and commit piracy with, when the technology exists to restrict them all. Cyber_Akuma You are missing the point, people aren't going to be ripping from Netflix over ripping from a Blu-Ray, and on top of that, they sure as hell aren't going to be ripping off a phone. And actually, you are wrong, the technology to "resist them all" does NOT actually exist. There is no one technology that "restricts them all" but several different technologies for different platforms with various levels of viability and success. Jimk4003 I said 'the technology exists'. When did I say it was a single piece of technology? Let's not be those guys who get in a pedantic argument about semantics on the internet. Regarding the issue under discussion; Netflix's job is to make their platform as robust as possible against piracy, using whatever technology is available to them. Blu-Ray simply isn't their problem. Cyber_Akuma Because just arguing "technology exists" is worthless, plenty of technology exists, and plenty of it is misused. Technically the technology to remotely brick your phone exists too, doesn't mean it's fine to use just because it "exists". And no, their platform already is robust, you are trying to ignore the fact that people ripping movies off a phone is a complete and total non-issue just to try to argue for Netflix's sake, this is ESPECIALLY considering the fact that it harms far more legitimate people than it helps. Sorry, but no, just a plain and completely undesputable NO. You can't argue that it's ok to use something that will hurt a large majority of people just to potentially possibly stop an extreme minority of people who would not even use this method anyway. That's like arguing it's ok to burn down a house to kill a spider. Jimk4003 "You can't argue that it's ok to use something that will hurt a large majority of people". We're talking about Netflix blocking rooted users; in what reality do they constitute the 'large majority' of Android users? Cyber_Akuma I meant the majority of the rooted users. Last time I checked, over 25% of people with an Android device had root access, which is several million users. And OF those several million rooted users, how many do you think actually use their rooted phone and Netflix app to pirate content? Less than 1% Hell, less than 0.1%? They are hurting over 99% of rooted Android users, which while not the majority of Android users is still a lot, to attempt to stop (and not even that effectively as there have been work-around for SafetyNet checks for nearly a year now) an extreme minority OF a minority from doing something they are unlikely to do due to other methods anyway. Richard Markert >I meant the majority of the rooted users. Even the majority of rooted users is a drop in the ocean when it comes to Android users worldwide. Cyber_Akuma Again, over 25%. You also completely missed the point of the argument in that this hurts nearly all rooted users that would not use this maliciously. Lord Argyris Looks like I'll have to start updating manually then. Or just not bother with the app at all since I rarely use Netflix on my phone as it is. SpasilliumNexus Thank goodness the 3T's Open Beta of OxygenOS is good enough for me to not unlock my device and stick with complete stock. Now I wonder why I haven't received any Netflix app updates beyond 4.16.1 build 15145 on the Play Store, when APKMirror has 4 newer versions. ast00 They asked for it. Now pirate their content knowing that you tried doing it the legal way, but THEY declined. Φώτης Because unlocking your Android powered device is such a "bad" thing to do. Whatever Netflix.

EowynCarter Yeah me too. And unless they change this, bye netflix account. No point in something I can't use anymore. Demoncat The funny part about video DRM is it's easily defeated. It's more convenient to steal the videos than to deal with the DRM restrictions. Fedup Exactly. Between VPN'ed torrents and nzbs, my Sonarr downloads all TV shows (netflix, HBO, ABC/CBS/NBC/FOX) automatically within minutes of them being ripped and posted by others. It is 100% automated, and with my Plex server running, I can watch shows anywhere - cost = $0.00. I don't do this to save money. I do it for the convenience, lack of ads, and freedom of time/place shifting. Heck, some shows actually download BEFORE they air on network TV (i.e. Designated Survivor). stan dex 97 new dark web premium links . also included are netfix lifetime membership links as well as graphic Live chat links (use anonymously) https://satoshibox.com/axbr7vnm6ifzk8hwtcreoe28/buy d0x360 I cancelled​ my account, sent them feedback and then just asked a friend who I let use HBO go and a Chromecast ultra if I could use their Netflix. David Gabel That seems rather dumb. Why cancel your service to them yet still use it via someone else? You're not teaching them anything. For an example, let's say you have a MacBook, and Apple does something to piss you off. You sell your MacBook, but then borrow a friend's MacBook. Nothing was actually accomplished. d0x360 Nothing was accomplished? I cancelled my account and let them know why. Now they aren't making money off me but I still to use their service. Your analogy is deeply flawed...deeply. So deeply I don't think you understand exactly what an analogy is. David Gabel So, you're "not giving them money" yet you still support them by using their product. It still seems like your logic is flawed. If you're really that pissed at Netflix, don't use it. Period. Use a different service instead of supporting them by borrowing it off a friend, as they are also giving them money (and support) , too via their subscription. revbones How is using their service for free "supporting" them? They aren't getting any revenue off you if you're not paying them. Saying you're supporting them by not paying them is a little stupid don't you think? xyz lol. So by your "logic" a person who pirates House of Cards is also supporting Netflix ? BobButtons You're doing the opposite of supporting. You're getting the benefits of their service while stopping payment and adding to server load which they pay for. David Gabel So far, your stance is the only one that makes sense. The rest so far are noise Sir Doogie Houser M.D.Esq. 200 You seen like an incredulous douch who I'd suplex onto a park bench for being a lap dog bitch.How is canceling or stealing not doing something.Also,its not a fucking macbook jerkoff its a paid service for TV on a phone they expect to be paid for.BTFO nagi Just another step that makes pirating the same content more convenient... we should really be going the other way if they ever want piracy to be reduced. lomsha Funny thing is their content is available to stream all over the internet. Don't see how this move fights piracy as long as computers have access. This just alienates legit users who are doing nothing nefarious on unlocked/rooted devices. Richard Branches By one everybody pays... Pathum Addarapathirana Dude I root my phone to just get iPhone emojis and to tether without my carrier knowing. Like I'm not stealing anything this will just make me stop paying for Netflix. Latheryin Just a heads up. Those treating hiding mods are fake. There is no way to hide if from the carrier. Heck if they wanted to they could see every web page you load from a ton of different places and ways. Yan Minari That’s why god invented VPN Latheryin Yes but even then it doesn't block everything. qqqqqq My provider absolutely blocks tethering - I've been using various methods, including VPNs, to block it for literally YEARS... Hasn't been difficult. Dylan Harris That's not true. All you have to due to bypass tethering limits on t-mobile is to change the TTL on the tethered device. Latheryin That just gets by the automated checks. Get a live person to randomly pick your account (not really likely but happens) and it is not had to tell if someone is tethering. Dmitri Smirnov All that person will be able to tell is whether customer is using a lot of data or not. And this is the root of the problem: be honest that you are limited traffic, instead of trying to play this game of "we'll pretent we are giving you unlimited data and in return you'll only use small-format mobile device, so that we'll hope that you won't be able to use as much of it". Kind of "all you can eat, but you have to only use a tea cup and one chopstick". Latheryin No the issue is people being entitled and taking advantage of things. You have people running their gaming systems and using hundreds of gb a month. Not only is that kinda dumb but it violate the fair use act in most cell TOS. If people didn't abuse the system then it wouldn't be an issue. Also just some food for thought. If they can't tell anything more then a lot of data just how do they route the traffic properly? Make no mistake. If the carrier wanted to they could tell. I know for a fact that there is a team for both att and Verizon that is tasked with just that. Dmitri Smirnov >No the issue is people being entitled and taking advantage of things. You have people running their gaming systems and using hundreds of gb a month. "taking advantage" I thought that people were in their right by using what they paid for. Allright, tell me this - is it allright for me to watch 4K video on my phone (since the screens allow it now)? What's the difference between this and me watching the same stream on my laptop over my phone's connection? What if I just redirect the video stream to my TV using WiDi or any other technology? How is browsing a site from a laptop different from browsing it from a phone network-congestion-wise? And then it boils down to the same argument - carriers are just hoping you'll use the network less from you phone device, as it's less convenient. The more convenient smartphones become for consuming large volumes of traffic, the sooner carriers will have to more away from this scan and expose the actual numbers. > If people didn't abuse the system then it wouldn't be an issue. If carriers would be honest and upfront about "hidden" caps, then people would not be able to game the system. > Also just some food for thought. If they can't tell anything more then a lot of data just how do they route the traffic properly? Make no mistake. If the carrier wanted to they could tell. Latheryin Tethering was never even an extra charge until people started taking advantage of the mobile networks. Watching 4k videos is not a big deal, using 200gb of mobile data in a cycle is flat out stupid. Mobile networks were not designed for that type of traffic from a single device. Nor was it made to handle running your ps4 while you are gaming. Why do you think that pages are made to be mobile friendly? Not only is it a usability issue but a data usage issue as well. It's not hidden. All people have to do is read the TOS. It's all right there. Yet most people just don't want to take the time to do it and then get made about it. Can't blame the carriers for that. Dmitri Smirnov > Watching 4k videos is not a big deal, using 200gb of mobile data in a cycle is flat out stupid. a) I'm glad we're finally on the same page that the real problem for networks is data usage and not tethering or no tethering. b) You are aware that you're contradicting yourself in the same sensense? 4K 60Fps video bitrate is ~20-40 MiB/s which gives an average movie the size of about 72GiB. so by your definition watching a movie in good quality is OK as long as you don't watch more than 3 of them in a month. c) how is using mobile data that you paid for - stupid? If there are caps - announce them and make it impossible to go over them instead of shaming people who actually decide to take you up on your offer. d) tethering has not been an extra charge until telcos understood that they could charge extra for it (just like them toying with idea of charging extra for Instant Messenger traffic, because it undercuts their SMS plans). > It's not hidden. All people have to do is read the TOS. It's all right there. Yet most people just don't want to take the time to do it and then get made about it. Can't blame the carriers for that. Well, carriers are the ones calling their plans "unlimited" and hiding the actual caps either buried deep in the ToS or behind the vague "reasonable usage". So don't blame people for not wanting to wade through pages of legalspeak just to learn that you lied and "unlmited" is just "50Gb and then throttled". Fedup Agreed. The problem is the AMOUNT of data consumed by a given user account - no how it is consumed. If carriers are concerned about individuals abusing their network, then they need to flag those accounts that use an excessive amount of bandwidth - whether it's through tethering or directly on the device itself. I could easily burn through 150GB/mo on my TMO Note 4 w/o tethering simply by leaving my Blue Iris app connected and streaming 24/7. So it's actually very easy to abuse the system without ever turning on the tethering. Android Developer Is the tether solution needed even if you do it using USB ? Fulbring What a stupid move. I pay for the premium for Netflix and I never thought that I might have to cancel my service just because they did this. The only reason why I have root is because of AdAway and TitaniumBackup. I still use the stock OnePlus 3T ROM. Wasn't expecting this at all.... Kinda suck. Will be interesting to see how many customers they lose. Julian Berger Not enough to change it back... 4Ui812 DRM has no place in our lives. I suspect Netflix will have a change of heart within 6 months. Branko Xiaomi phones say bye bye to Netflix. Google go fuck yourselves. Steve_Jobroni Go fucking buy a windows phone. 天地人 Seriously though Windows phones are great. The only problem with them is the lack of applications. Otherwise, it runs great on low-end hardware, has a great UI, the homescreen is innovative, synchronisation with Windows PCs is cool, etc. dukaki Don't forget that you can use the Netflix website on Edge instead of their shitty app, and it streams at full 1080p, even on my L650 with a 720p screen. 天地人 Wait the Netflix application hasn't an option to stream at FHD? dukaki Nope, just 480p like on android. The device has to be "certified" and there are no certified windows phones afaik. The WP app doesn't even have downloads yet, I think. Edit: Just checked, no option to download here but you can on the desktop app. EowynCarter Might end with a visit at the apple store in my case. Windows phone is kind of not supported anymore. Jimk4003 This is Netflix, not Google. Cyber_Akuma Google invented this SafetyNet crap, let anyone use it for any reason (Hell, Pokemon GO of all things started using it), and over the last year have been making it even more and more strict and unforgiving. So no, a HUGE part of the blame does lie on Google for being openly hostile towards rooted users and not giving a damn about them. Jimk4003 There are legitimate reasons to use Safetynet to check the integrity of a device: Android Pay (or banking apps in general) is one example. It isn't necessarily hostility to root users; it's just a reality that Google need to be able to demonstrate to banks or other third parties that their OS is secure, and that people can't bypass built in security safeguards. Netflix need to do the same with the studios they redistribute content for; and they've chosen to use Safetynet to do it. Netflix isn't a human right; you have no inalienable right to root your phone and to use Netflix. Cyber_Akuma Except that not even my own banking app uses SafetyNet, it still has root checking and certain sensitive features are disabled if I am rooted, but not the entire app. Furthermore, it IS hostility to rooted users, because anyone can toss SafetyNet into their app for any reason whatsoever (such as games using it "just because" in case of cheaters... which doesn't even help at all to stop them). Google has been completely unwilling to work out ANY sort of compromise or method that can keep a phone secure without basically tossing rooted users under the bus. Jimk4003 What sort of compromise do you envision? Cyber_Akuma I am saying that they didn't even try. PCs by default obviously allow admin accounts all the time, even as the main user account (as much as that is not recommended) yet can maintain security. Google when they were confronted with people who were hurt by SafetyNet, legitimate users mind you, basically just shrugged them off and didn't even bother considering what could be done to allow the device to remain secure while also having such safeties in place. I mean, all these apps that you can use on your phone, can also be used on a PC, many of them available in either a browser or native app format, yet it remains secure. There is no reason this could not be done with Android, especially considering it used Linux as a base, they are just refusing to even consider it. Jimk4003 Don't you already have that choice? Your phone is sold without root access (i.e. no admin rights), and you can then choose whether or not to root your device and gain elevated privileges. If you do choose to root your device, you will lose access to some Safetynet enabled applications. You can, of course, unroot if necessary. Cyber_Akuma First of all, not all phones are. Especially in non-US countries. Second, it shouldn't have to be a choice. How many PC apps refuse to run under an admin account? Practically none. I shouldn't have to choose between having root access or being able to use a apps that more and more are starting to add this nonsense to them. Third, it's not even just root, even having an unlocked BOOTLOADER now, even if your rom is 100% stock and unrooted, can trip SafetyNet, it didn't used to be that strict. It's ridiculous to claim one should be able to have one or the other, even SafetyNet could have been designed to not be this brokenly strict, but Google had no interest in doing so, and they are rapidly making having root more and more useless while we still have to deal with all the junk they force on your phone from the manufacturer... that you can only remove with root. Jimk4003 Well, it is what it is. You believe you shouldn't have to make a choice, whereas I believe life is all about making choices and living with the outcomes. We seldom get everything we want, and neither Netflix, nor rooting, are inalienable rights. Whether or not you think it should be a choice, it is one; choose what you feel is best for you. Cyber_Akuma That's not even an argument, that's just trying to claim that the status quo should remain for no reason other than it is the status quo. It shouldn't have to be a choice, and arguing that people have to choose between root and having an increasingly less amount of apps just because "it is what it is" is insanity. In fact, it wasn't even the status quo before until Google started pulling this nonsense with SafetyNet a short while ago. That doesn't mean people should just accept it. Jimk4003 It's not an argument, because there is no argument to be had. The reality of the situation is self-evident; you can't have a rooted device and install Netflix via Google Play. Accepting the status quo has nothing to do with it; it's simply acknowledging reality. You have to choose what's more important to you; Netflix or rooting your phone. Finding the reality frustrating, as you clearly do, won't make it any less real. If this was a serious discussion on human rights; censorship, migration, justice, gender equality etc., then it's important in a democracy to be aware of your rights and responsibilities, and challenge the status quo where necessary. But this isn't anything like that. This is two for-profit corporations, Google and Netflix, who provide services to which you have no fundamental right to access, nor any obligation to use. You can choose to pay for their services and accept their terms and conditions, or you can choose not to. You don't get to pick the terms and conditions of the service someone else is providing you; however you are free to not use the service if you don't like the terms and conditions under which they are provided. That's it; it's no simpler or more complicated than that. Ranting on the internet about how unfair you perceive it to be is irrelevant. Again, it is what it is. Cyber_Akuma Again, there is no "it is what it is" argument. There should be no choice, PERIOD. You are basically saying that people should not complain about this just because "it is what it is". No, it is NOT what it is, it should NOT BE what it is, and people can and WILL complain that it SHOULD NOT be what it is. You aren't even making any rational arguments anymore, just re-stating what the current situation is and then basically claiming that people should not want or expect better. Jimk4003 You can want or expect better if you like. Netflix, like every other for-profit enterprise in a capitalist system, will either succeed or fail based on its ability to turn a profit. Right now, Netflix is turning a profit, and clearly thinks it can be more profitable by excluding rooted users whose theoretical ability to circumvent DRM restrictions may impact its ability to secure rights to new content. Clearly you disagree with their stance, and the only way to see for sure if your disagreement is warranted is to watch their financial performance from here on out. None of the above changes the fact that you aren't entitled to Netflix. You've chosen to root your phone, and Netflix have recently chosen to exclude rooted users. That leaves you with a choice to make. Even if you think that choice is unfair, even if you think you should be able to have both. The reality is you can't have both, and you will have to choose. Again, Netflix isn't a right. Go elsewhere if you disagree with their business practices; that's how capitalism works. Beyond that, you're just having a spat with reality; and that's a tough fight to win ;) Cyber_Akuma Actually, what do you think would lose them more profits, the theoretical minority OF a minority that MIGHT rip movies on their phones (which still requires a Netflix account in the first place) or blocking that 25% minority? Also, drop this "right" nonsense. No, seriously, drop it right now. People are paying for a Netflix account, they DO have a right to get the service they paid for. Netflix made zero warning or mention of this impending block, they pulled it out of nowhere for paying customers. So sorry, but they DO have a right to the service, since they are paying for it. Sony was found to be legally in the wrong when they removed the OtherOS feature from the PS3, because why? Because people PAID for the console when it had that feature, they DID have a right to what they paid for. You're just having a spat with arguing for argument's sake when you don't even have an argument. Jimk4003 There is no argument; it's the reality of the situation. Netflix have implemented DRM controls that block access to the Netflix app via the Play Store on rooted devices. I do understand why Netflix want to tighten their DRM procedures, and I do understand why some people have been left frustrated by this change. The reality is, however, if you want to download the Netflix app via Google Play, you will need an un-rooted phone; such as the phones used by the majority of Android users. That's all that's happening. I get that you don't like it. But stamping your foot and shouting 'no fair, no fair' achieves nothing. Netflix are entitled to run their business how they see fit within the law; and consumers get to choose whether they want to give Netflix their business or not. That's all there is to it. Don't like the way Netflix do business; don't give Netflix your money. Cyber_Akuma All you are doing with the "it is what it is" argument is just repeating what the article is saying. That is not conductive to anything. Anyone who has read the article knows what is happening right now. And sorry, but you are doing the same stamping your foot with the "well, it is what it is" argument. Not to mention that you are also wrong, because over the last 5 or so years ALONE there have been dozens of examples of consumers speaking out against policies or DRM and the companies begin forced to reverse it from the backlash. So you are doing nothing but hurting legitimate users by trying to argue "it is what it is". And again, no, they are not entitled to run their business in a way that without warning locks customers out of what they paid for, Sony tried this... and got in legal trouble and lost. So sorry, but you are wrong, and you have been nothing but wrong this entire argument. Netflix isn't' "entitled" to do this, people DO have a reason to complain, there IS a reason to complain, complaining HAS changed such practices before, and all you are doing is further hurting legitimate users by attempting to insist the "it is what it is" non-argument. Your entire argument has been fundamentally wrong from the start. Jimk4003 It's not my argument; it's simply Netflix's position. I get you don't agree with it, but it's totally valid for Netflix to wish to strengthen their DRM procedures. You do know I'm not responsible for Netflix's decision making, right? It is what it is; I wouldn't get too upset about it. Cyber_Akuma Again, "it is what it is" is not a valid argument. Jimk4003 No it's not an argument. Again, there is no argument necessary; the reality of the situation is self-evident, and no amount of arguing here will change it. The fact is this; YOU rooted your phone. You weren't forced. You should have known that by rooting your phone you are modifying the device beyond its factory specification. You should have known that this essentially makes you responsible for the proper operation of the device; you no longer have the device manufacturer or Google to turn to when software that you have modified doesn't work as expected. You should also have known that rooting prevents a device from complying with the compatibility test suite, and that this can affect your devices ability to function correctly. You should have been aware of the SafetyNet API, and anticipated the fact that this API would be adopted more and more broadly as Google promoted its usage. You can't blame Google for this; as before, once you modify your device beyond its factory spec, you're responsible for supporting yourself. Rooting a device is at the owners risk. You've now found yourself in a situation where a modification you have made to your device prevents you from accessing a service you want to use. That's on you; no-one made you modify your device, no-one said they would take responsibility for the changes you have made to your device, and rooted users are expected to assume liability for any ramifications and complications they face as a result of their decision to modifying their device. Netflix are well within their rights to enforce DRM on their product by using the SafetyNet API provided by Google, and the Google documentation clearly states rooted devices will fail the CTS check. This documentation is publicly available. You went ahead and rooted your device anyway. That's on you. It's no-one elses job to make sense of the decisions you have taken. You're free to carry on using Netflix if you return your device to a state where the integrity of the device can be verified. Or you're free to carry on using a rooted device and living with the compromises that entails. Your choice. Cyber_Akuma I don't think you get it. All you are doing is parroting what the article is saying. Furthermore, despite there being plenty of examples of complaining doing EXACTLY what you claim it cannot do, that is to change such decisions, you keep repeating that "complaining will do nothing". You are a broken record, arguing the same "it is what it is" argument over and over so you can avoid actually thinking. An argument (and yes, no matter how much YOU stomp your feet that it is not, it IS an argument) that has already been disproven over and over and over. You also ignored that there are many countries where phones are already sold rooted, or how such things don't effect using such services on a PC with admin rights which are the same thing, or the dozens of other holes in your logic large enough to sail a ship through. There is no "you should have been aware" because this is a total lapse in common sense and my device is in no way incompatible from a hardware or software level, but rather, the app is purposely rejecting it. Furthermore, they made no prior warning whatsoever. This is like arguing "you should have known modern cars could be remotely disabled" if a dealership decides to just disable all cars with an aftermarket radio installed. I don't know where to even begin with all the broken wrong logic in that last post. Why are you even here if you couldn't care less? You are free to carry on being a living example of "First they came", but don't come crying about how nobody else is listening to you because you could not possibly be any more wrong. I DO have a right to use Netflix on my device, rooted or no, if I am paying for it. If you argue against this, you are wrong. People DO have a right to root their devices, if you argue against this, you are wrong. People DO have a right (and have many many MANY times in the past) to challenge the "it is what it is" status quo, if you argue against this, you are wrong. And I know you WILL argue against this, which will mean that, see above, you are wrong. I have been more than patient with your insane thick-headnedness. At this point I can't tell if you are being willfully ignorant or really are just that ignorant. Or just trolling, that is an option as well. There is no way anyone rational at this point can continue to argue the insanity that you have argued. Jimk4003 I interpret personal insults as an indicator that the individual making them no longer has any faith in their actual arguments, and so I think it's time to call time on this particular discussion. As you've pointed out, neither of us is getting anywhere. It's been fun, but once it starts getting abusive, the fun has to stop. It's a shame, because DRM Vs individual user rights has the potential to be a really interesting discussion topic. I hope you get what you're after; and that the reality of the situation will change to be more in line with what you think it should be. Unfortunately I imagine the situation regarding DRM and rooted devices will only get more restrictive going forward. Take care. Cyber_Akuma You purposely instigate people into losing their patience with you, and then claim "I win because you got angry", especially when the anger is because you were refusing to understand the entire argument throughout this entire mess. Richard Markert Root is, by definition, unsecure. Any time you have userland processes that have access to ring0 you are inherently unsecure, as there are no restrictions placed upon running code at that point. Cyber_Akuma And yet, there are ways to run it securely on PCs. Netflix and online banking would not be available on PCs if it wasn't. TedPhillips mostly agree. by providing a turn-key 'lockdown' check, and further by ret-conning it into playstore access (let's see how far they take that) -google is now openly hostile to anyone who bought into android for it's ability to customize and truly 'own' your own device. the open source roots of android was a big differentiator vs something like iOS, but now that they have dominate market position - they are walking away from that without concern. (only worrying about how slow they need to boil the frog to get away with it) meanwhile, what middle manager is going to say 'no' to adding safetyNet checks in their app or play store listing? it is an easy way for them to write down on potential risks, unjustified (which it pretty much always is) or not. blindexecutioner So the solution is to install from outside the play store. That's great for security. Way to go. Richard Markert No they don't. Since Windows 7, new and default users are not Admin accounts. koiulpoi Sorry, this is absolutely wrong. The first user created on a Windows PC has full administrative access, limited by UAC. You can still delete System32, it's just mildly harder than it used to be. If "new and default users" were not Admin accounts, they couldn't install software, so... Richard Markert Default user accounts are higher than Limited accounts, but not as high as Admin accounts. That's why they can install software. Linux users are not admins but can still install software, right? It started on Windows 7, expanded in 8/8.1 and now in Windows 10 a user account behaves just like a user account in Linux. It has no access to %systemdir% unless you manually go in the folder properties and give your user account Admin permissions to it. You can still run things AS admin by giving the permission at runtime, but since all that requires is pressing a button (if your built-in admin account isn't passworded, which it isn't by default, one step forward two back, sigh) and most users are too "stupid" to simply not press that button. koiulpoi It's really funny when people speak authoritatively about something they're so wrong about. The first account created by the Windows OOBE is automatically added to the Administrators group. This means they're an Administrator. They have Administrative privileges. The fact that certain actions are blocked until you click "yes" on a simple UAC prompt doesn't stop this; they're in "Admin Approval Mode", which can be disabled via GPO if you care to. If you buy a computer from Dell (example), set it up, then go to System32 and start deleting .dll files, it'll ask for administrative privileges, but you can click yes and away it goes! Some files are protected at "SYSTEM" level, which is higher than administrator, but DEFAULT USERS ARE ADMINISTRATORS. This has ABSOLUTELY nothing to do with the "password" on the built-in "Administrator" account. That account is disabled out-of-the-box. Please, you're digging a bigger hole trying to look "right". How to prove this: Set up a new computer. Set up user default for MS. Start -> Run -> netplwiz -> Be amazed that your user is part of the group "Administrators". TechGuy22 Haha kodi Doesn't matter to me I Stopped paying for Netflix long time ago. C64 Haha Teranium TV 😎 TechGuy22 I like that too. You can even get the mod one and remove the ads. Lol C64 I know, i always use those. I want to pay for the dev, but there's no option to do that. Koko time is coming with a big update to tim242 Thief. Renato Santos This is stupid. Congratulations, Netflix. Jan-Lk Else It is also getting more and more necessary to unlock / root devices due to missing updates etc. But I'm not a Netflix customer and won't become one. C64 Whahaha, this has to be the most retarded move of the year in any category (even Trump can't top this). I'm glad i don't use Old Crap Flix. A Person Hillary, then Netflix. C64 Nope sorry. Since Trump is your president i can't take America serious anymore A Person Timeout, you're not even a US citizen? No interest in your opinion. James F Wow. Just wow. I can't take you seriously either if that's how you treat people. Not cool, man. A Person "Wow, just wow"? When he can vote in our elections I'll take his opinions of our elections seriously. It is highly ill-informed anyhow. Paul Sterling A person wins! Marcelove Timeout, you are a Trump supporter? No interest in your opinion (neither anyone smart in the world). Roy Riddex Just so I'm clear on this, by unlocked are we talking about SIM unlocked? lomsha No no, unlocked bootloader. Roy Riddex Thanks Corbin Davenport Unlocked bootloader. pbergonzi I wonder how long they'll stick with that premise seeing as how much public opinion expressed here is against them. Screw them. Get the APK somewhere else or install magisk and hide your root. Too many people root their devices and have a good reason for doing so and Netflix should not penalize them. Doby Gillis Dude, normal people don't give a fuck about rooted phones. It's just the elitist twats who do it anymore. twiz0r Dude, you're an elitist twat. Richard Markert Most people who root seem to be. The sentiment among rooters is "if you don't root your phone, you're not as good as me and don't deserve to have a phone. Root you stupid noob!" twiz0r thanks for confirming your twatness. good day. C64 One word ..... Bullshit Corey Kinard I've yet to see that... Maybe you just feel like that because they do in fact know more than you? Richard Markert My first version of Android was 1.5. I've seen it for many years. How long have you been in the scene? EowynCarter My phone isn't rooted. And not compatible anymore ! Franco Fassio Unlocked bootloader maybe? EowynCarter Yes. But seam I can't lock it without wipe. So screw you Netflix. Marcelove Let me guess, your profile pic is that right? https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/0f0c4f3e3ce40074aebfe58d80511d4a0b7d4a94896ce54d82e448a1cd2e3ceb.jpg bruce lancaster Dude. It isn't just rooted phones - Also unlocked. Elitists get their iphones and galaxy s8s from att and verizon. Normal people get their devices from amazon, ebay, newegg, gearbest etc. Jimk4003 I'm sure Netflix are terrified that the tiny fraction of Android users who come to this site, and the similarly tiny fraction who root their phones, are bothered. The rest of the world won't care. bruce lancaster An article in Wireless Week (cellphone industry rag) a couple of months back says it's now a majority of phones in Asia that are unlocked and Europe is getting pretty close to 50/50. US passed 30% unlocked around Christmas. People aren't getting their phones from ATT, Verizon, etc any more now that they have to pay full retail and don't get a free or heavily discounted flagship device with contract renewal. They are getting them from Amazon, Gearbest, Newegg, etc and moving their sim. If I owned stock in Netflix right now, I'd sell it quick on this news. Everything that isn't already mobile is going mobile. Alienating half the European market and 30% of the US market is asinine. Fedup Yup. Ditched my flagship Samsung phone for a 'budget' Moto G5 Plus that is 100% compatible with all four US carriers (and their dozens of MNVOs). Swapping providers is as easy as changing the sim. And despite the slower spec'ed hardware, the carrier bloat-free Nougat is WAY faster than my TW Galaxy phone - and the battery life is INSANE. C64 Probably 90 % of the people don't know what root is. Almost every person I know owns an Android device, but i'm the only geek who flashes and roots his devices bruce lancaster It isn't just rooted phones but also unlocked phones. Got your phone on amazon? Got it on ebay? Got it from gearbest? Got it from newegg? Yup. No netflix for you without jumping through enough hoops that you'll actually know about rooting by the time you get it done. Fedup Are we conflating a carrier-unlocked vs. bootloader unlocked phone? They are two distinctly different things, and I doubt that having a carrier-unlocked phone (i.e. using a TMO phone on ATT, or VZ on Sprint) has any impact on SafetyNet or Widevine. pbergonzi Judging from the posts here it looks like nobody who roots their phone uses Netflix anyway so I guess it's moot. But the outcry sure did get them a bunch of free publicity. T4rd This is what Magisk is for. Pretty sure if I can still use Android Pay with my rooted 6P, I can still use/update Netflix through the Play Store. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Magisk still requires that you unlock your bootloader, which is enough to trigger safety net these days, so that won't work. TechGuy22 You don't know how magisk works do you Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ I understand that Magisk is a great tool for modifying my system without actually modifying it. I understand that there are many modules that allow you to do things like hide root, bypass security modules, skin your system, and plenty of other things. What I don't understand is how you can install magisk without unlocking your bootloader. Back when I originally tried it out with pokemon go, it worked well for a while, but eventually even just having my bootloader unlocked was all it took to throw SafetyNet. If that's not an issue anymore, then great! But maybe say that instead of being snarky. Thomas Gladdines Bootloader can be simply locked after rooting and installing a custom recovery. Edwin O. Lol no You could, but then you can't flash anything with said recovery... So no point Thomas Gladdines LOL the recovery doesn't stop working after a bootloader is locked, only fastboot won't flash images but the recovery can do whatever it wants to, update the rom, edit system files etc. Muzzy996 Well as an example for the Google Pixel: https://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=71901761&postcount=454 In this case all it takes is a kernel that supports Magisk and hides the fact that the bootloader is unlocked, at which point with Magisk Hide enabled all root and SafetyNet checks pass. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Excellent. I'll have to look back into this then, last time I used magisk it wasn't as capable, glad to see it's come this far. sbeaulieu Magical Hide is there for that Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Can Magical Hide hide that my bootloader is unlocked? Serious question, not being sarcastic or snarky as I was below. sbeaulieu It does make the SafetyNet check pass iJeggu Magisk itself doesn't hide an unlocked bootloader it only hides root but must custom roms simply delete the verifiedbootstate -flag which in turn makes safetynet pass even with an unlocked bootloader. Some older devices don't have this flag in their kernels in the first place so safetynet will accept that the flag is missing. Link to the patch that most custom roms (kernels to be specific) have to pass safetynet: https://github.com/sultanxda/android_kernel_oneplus_msm8996/commit/abc05b16bbd33521c2fffaf491c5657a94bfcfc5 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/5b1ff3f47e32d5f57ddadcd650a5b94725bd4e6242cea92e269f51e988d0d426.png T4rd Except it's working for me right now... jonzey231 This has been happening for a week now. I tweeted it to Ruddock a few days ago. Just didn't put together that it was because I was unlocked. https://twitter.com/jonzey231/status/862122438125072384 steelew Google really needs to start stealing from the root community the way apple takes from the jailbreak community. It feels like rooting is way down except for a few (legal) use cases. If it weren't for visual tweaks & usability tweaks, I would have no need to root (personally). This kind of stuff starts to make rooting unpleasant. I already can't use fingerprint auth in my banking app any more because root. Jesús Cuenca They do. I used rooms for like 8 years maybe? And a lot of the "new features" always come of the rom or root comunity. Right now i use roms, but not root. Marcelove I'm trying to stay indoors, but is complicate... Greenify for example, works at no root devices nowadays... But is way better with root and Xposed... Doze can't compare against Greenify... Maybe at version number 20 root wouldn't be necessary... Sandeep Raghuraman What about the version downloaded from Amazon app store though? Does that work fine? TwoBit Gary It worked, but it is old version without show downloads. Go to apkmirror oculairmedia Interesting move. I flashed a custom ROM on my Nexus 6 because stock was so slow that it was getting unusable, but screw me right ? Atoqir In my country lots of stuff doesn't work on unrooted devices. My bank app, payment app and local cable TV and digicorder app all stopped working. Also s-health doesn't work anymore and soon Netflix. Time to unroot Marcelove "Time to unroot" Sheep. Richard Markert Rooting is insecure. You don't need to access the system partition except to break things. Benjamin Walburn If that were the case then this wouldn't be an issue. Nobody is looking to break their phone. Richard Markert Few people I've talked to online know what they're doing when it comes to root. Most of those end up breaking things. Rooting is far too easy and probably shouldn't exist at all. Benjamin Walburn You could say the same about anything, not just modification of phones. Maybe you shouldn't own a car if you can't fix it yourself, or have kids if you aren't a doctor. Rooting isn't easy, it's made easy by the hard work of other people. It's not up to you what other people do with their property, you have no right to say that they shouldn't. And if someone breaks their phone, what does it have to do with you? It's their hobby and their phone. You're not their daddy. senoredusty Or use Magisk DJMix No need. You could use magisk su hide for the moment. it still passes the safetynet. I too use a banking app that cannot be used on normal root proocess faceless128 "please stop giving us money and use Kodi instead" Sounds like a great business plan! JD For the sake of Kodi's developers don't say Kodi in that context. ericshmerick Hrmm, every time I hear Kodi, I think of pirated content. Guess when people are like "I use Kodi for my 30TB media collection" I stop and wonder how... Yes, ripping a lifetime of DVDs, but nah. Probably piracy. C64 I know a few how really use it legally Powsniffer0110 Yea I use it legally 95% of the time. ErectBipedal nah man, I use Kodi to browse my 30TB of linux isos. Totally legit I swear. Chazz Matthews Torrents are legal too. Just depends on the content. Mike Honestly though, if pirate add-ons wern't available on kodi, 98% of the people using it now would not have even heard of it before. Even bad publicity is good publicity. They are not going to publicly come out and say it, but the add-on's are the only reason they're well known. Andy Roid But kodi makes piracy so easy! Blian Oh god, please stop. Nobody is using Kodi for their DVD rips. Railwayman I rather say Fusion and Exodus et al instead since Kodi is... Kodi and you have to install what you want. The Netflix business plan is for her more people on Exodus, Phoenix and SALTS - not to mention Terrarium TV and MovieBox as well. Kevin Strident Kodi is open source. If Kodi stops wanting to be as useful as it is now, someone will fork it and keep it doing what its users enjoy. cbstryker Kodi is just an open source media player. To watch any pirated content you either need to download it or install an unaffiliated plugin that streams from pirated sources. C64 Next kodi wil have drm build in. So people have to use forks. I stopped using kodi since i found Teranium TV. cbstryker That makes zero sense. Kodi's reason for existing would stop. C64 That's BS my friend, Kodi (xbmc) has started on the original xbox and was made and used as a media player Justin D Same...but with Plex and something else >.> Dany Lol I know right? I was using Kodi more than Netflix anyway so... Dmitry Stepanushkin Xposed + RootCloak or something similar will do it for most of apps for those who need root. So I think not a big problem. Abhishek Saral Not a big problem but a big annoyance. tehboogieman Hmm, rootcloak isn't working for me with netflix m477 No, it won't work. Safetynet always fails if you have closed activated, or if you just have an unlocked bootloader. Sometimes even by just having adb debugging turned on. Kan☆n MagiskSU and its manager app comes with a very good hider built-in. No Xposed needed. h4rr4r Beyond pointless. Netflix won by being easier than piracy, this threatens to turn back the clock on that. Lexster These companies don't seem to get that most people pirate because it's easier/cheaper than buying what they want. Yes, it's wrong, whatever, the point is streaming services made it easier for people, which outweighed the hassle of pirating it. You're right, this kind of thing is what will get people to start doing it again more. BobButtons If I can't use Netflix on my rooted phone, it's Netflix that'll go, not the root. They're encouraging piracy. YaKillaCJ Exactly. Screw it, I only have Netflix for convenience. This will also have negative impact on many devices and average consumers even if they never unlock or root. A lot don't have Google certification, such as upcoming OEMs. Then theirs beta roms like Xiaomi and OnePlus that run awesome. Marcelove Funny thing: I was about to become a subscriber of Netflix after seeing House of Cards by PirateBay but now through the official channel because I thought that Netflix deserved my money... Look : deservED... But this movie will keep me at PirateBay... Funny thing 2: I have a Moto G5 that I could unlock and root and I didn't it just because I wanna see how things are nowadays without root... And I use a lot of apps that would work better with root (Greenify for example)... So I would be able to use Netflix... And I won't and will stay that way only because this douchebag move... Congratulations Netflix... Funny thing 3: So happy that I waited till House of Cards release to become a subscriber... Netflix should learn something from Frank Underwood... And from Blockbuster... tim242 Yeah, sure you were. Once a thief, always a thief. koiulpoi This is the most untrue statement I've read on this website. Thomas Elephants can fly 天地人 http://gadling.com/2012/06/10/airline-transports-herd-of-african-elephants-photos/ koiulpoi Nice! You matched it. 天地人 Yes, because illegally pirating from huge corperations which constantly attempt to and successfully brainwash people into agenda using various tricks, is somehow bad? You're not supporting the creators of the show, sure. But you're also not supporting the 6 Jewish companies that control 90% of American media. Anyways, with your little money you wouldn't be benefitting anybody. Do you honestly think those Jewish companies are dying to get a hold of your $120 you payed for Netflix this year? Probably not. The creators of the show, are well off anyways. Don't companies pay them to have their content on their platform and pay for their production cost and wages? Then; they've already been payed. I'm not endorsing piracy. It isn't the best thing to do, but I think calling people a "thief" and grouping them with people who have actually stolen things off individuals which mean a lot to the individual and murdered some individuals in the process, is just stupid. It's not the same as 'stealing' bits of 1s and 0s. Again, I'm not endorsing piracy, however there are a lot of good reasons to pirate movies and TV shows. Paul Sterling You're a thief. People leave their families for months to give you works of art. Games, movies, music. You can't throw them a few bucks? I'm legit, always will be. Also, tax helps everyone. Your wall of text is just trying to convince yourself, thief. 天地人 Nope. A thief is different from a pirate, besides, they've already been payed. And I was talking about TV shows and movies, but you're too dense to realise it. jj14x Not the same. If I spend time writing code for software, and decide to sell a monthly license instead of a perpetual license, that is my choice. Your choice should be to either subscribe to the monthly license, or to find a competitor software to use instead. Choosing to bypass the licensing checks makes you a thief (taking something without the owner's permission makes you a thief). And same logic applies to TV shows/movies. If you want to own the movie and watch it whenever you want it, BUY it. "illegally pirating from huge corperations which constantly attempt to and successfully brainwash people into agenda using various tricks, is somehow bad?"<-- YES - it is still illegal. Just because somebody stole your car doesn't mean you can go and steal that person's car in retaliation. There are laws and procedures on how to handle that. STDog Illegal != bad, legal != good. Thousands of unjust laws have been passed. They made actions illegal that were not bad. Richard Markert It's trickle-down, man. Think about if everybody thought like you. Netflix has 100 million subs and each pay at the minimum $107/yr and that's 10.7 billion. Now if that 10.7 billion were wiped out in an instant, how is Netflix going to make new shows or seasons of existing shows? It's the same with the rest of the content creation business. You and me, we're just a drop in the bucket when it comes to their revenue, but instead of scooping it out a spoonful at a time while adding water by the cup, somebody dumped the bucket over, there would be no money left to pay the content creators before content is even made. Railwayman I guess you like DRM and proprietary vendor lock in? The only moral of the story is: Pay for legit services then and watch posted content - the creators get paid and you get proper content without restrictions. The day the industry realize that DRM, geo blocking and so forth are counter productive will be historic. Fedup Love my Moto G5 Plus. Best phone I've had so far - and that's coming from a number of Samsung flagship phones. It's so much snappier and the battery life is insane. I waited a full 48 hours before caving and unlocking/rooting. Haven't looked back. I hate ads, and w/o root, you can't miracast to anything other than chromecast. Trysta Noticed this a little while ago. The crazy thing is I'm not even rooted or interested in any mods. I needed to sideload the latest version 7.1.2 because my RMA Nexus 6p refused to update on its own. I'm keeping the bootloader unlocked so I can recover if my phone boot loops. I rarely use Netflix on my phone but this is kind of annoying. I suspect this has something to do with offline movie watching (which is amazing). jj14x You don't need to unlock bootloader to sideload the full OTA images that Google publishes on their website. Tim Harman But you do need it to recover in your phone bootloops, as he said. jj14x True, but by that logic, everyone should keep their phone's bootloader unlocked all the time (because a bootloop, in theory, could happen to anyone/anytime) - not just when flashing a factory image. EowynCarter You don't ? Had to when installing a developper preview. Then I left it that way, so I won't be locked out in case of boot loop. TedPhillips or when you have some random block on disk get corrupted, ala nexus 9. ilovetesla Dumbest blocking I've ever heard Bruce Wayne I stopped rooting ages ago. Android has gotten so good that I don't need it anymore. Muzzy996 Good for you! Not everyone feels the same though, I know I sure don't. Tasker, Adaway, Greenify, Titanium, Substratum and GMD Gesture Controls are all more important to me than Netflix. The day Netflix stops working on my rooted devices (which are what I watch it on, not my TV) is the day I'll cancel my service. No big loss compared to losing root. Richard Markert Tasker is interesting but never felt the need for it. Adaway, titanium are both irrelevant on my S7, I despise gestures beyond simple swiping in the Cardinal directions, and if stock Android is so perfect why do you need to theme it? C64 I have a s7 edge and the stockrom is full of bloatware from Microsoft, Sansung and Google. More than 20 useless apps are included. So yes the s7 needed root. tim242 Wrong. Package Disabler, no root required. Richard Markert No, it doesn't. Everything not necessary for function is disableable. C64 You can't disable everything Muzzy996 Never said android is perfect, if it was there wouldn't be any competition in the market or users such as myself who feel the need to customize Android. Root is not something I push onto others, its just something that I want on my devices and I make choices about what services I use or devices I purchase based upon my ability to do it. Railwayman I take that you like ads, then? Using a non-rooted Samsung without Taller would be like using a feature phone again but with ads. Having an automated device without ads and bloat is certainly a basic requirement to me. Richard Markert Adhell and Disconnect pro. What's an ad? Railwayman I don't see any ads on my Ericsson GF388 either. Don't have to install a single piece of software in order to get there. Ericsson win, Samsung loose.:) Your Samsung still has Google ad services and so forth running even if you are blocking them on the "non root level". My devices are completely ad free with Google ads disabled system wide and in all apps. Samsung loose every time even if their followers are trying to find different "non root methods" to "solve" things that other devices do without any issues due to... root. kostas110 maybe if you use some 500+ euro smartphone from 2016-2017 something that not everyone can do C64 I disagree, Android is one big advertising if you don't use root. Apps have ads (not every app has a pro version), internet browsing sucks without Adaway (build in ad blockers in browsers aren't great), YouTube really sucks if it isn't modded (watch a 30 second ad for a 3 minute movie). And devices are full of bloatware that can't be removed without root. Even the Google stuff are bloatware (kiosk, movies,music,books etc). I also like to remove alot of system apps and replace them with my own apps that i prefer (file manager, agenda, email, music/ video player) and i really hate duplicate apps on my devices. Also Titanium Backup is important to me. So Android​ without root isn't Android for me. jetscreamer01 I use adguard to block stupid ads in my apps. Now using any commercial apps is enjoyable. Richard Markert Samsung's Internet has the Adblock extension and it literally blocks everything. I also use Disconnect Pro and Adhell for system-wide ad blocking. Titanium Backup I never really used even back when I was rooting phones - it has been replaced 100% by Smart Switch. But then, I haven't needed to restore a backup (except for switching devices) in years, probably because I don't run janky community junkroms. Muzzy996 The only reason you feel that Smart Switch completely replaces Titanium is because you never used other features of Titanium that go beyond what Smart Switch is intended for. Things like shortcuts to freeze/defrost apps, multiple version backups or market management are useful to some even if they're on rooted stock OEM ROMs. They're not must haves for the masses though but some of us do appreciate their usefulness. Cyber_Akuma I hate this response. If anything, I have found far more reasons to root than ever before. Being able to create a backup image and install security/tracking software tat can't just be wiped/uninstalled easily is a big one for example. DJMix I really couldn't understand these kind of stupid moves. I mean I kinda get for an Android Pay or some banking apps to implement these limitations. But seriously, a frickin' streaming app? Afraid they're gonna get pirated? For someone who's going to pirate, they probably could just probably reverse engineer the apk and remove the limitations or basically use older apps. Do they really have some idle engineers that they're forced to implement useless feature? ddevito Guess I'll just pirate it all soon. Their loss. JD Fuck Android If OEMs would fucking provide updates for 5 years I wouldn't need to unlock my bootloader. I'm out. I'll come back when Google fixes this shit. Also fuck Netflix. Back to pirating it is. Christopher Bement My app stopped working on my N7 when I sideloaded 5.0. Got an error when trying to play anything. I went and dropped it back to stock on the latest patch and relocked the bootloader. All working fine now. Too fucking bad, Nougat is fantastic on that device, leaps and bounds better than Marshmallow. tehboogieman Which ROM and which N7 do you have? I still have the stock ROM on my 2013 N7 LTE and have been procrastinating loading an N ROM on it Christopher Bement 2013 LTE version and I was using Nitrogen OS (fantastic and stable ROM). I am now on the latest Marshmallow just so that Netflix will work. tehboogieman As long as I can side load it and sign in I'm still ok. It's a pain, but I'd live with that. But if NF blocks root users from signing in, I'm definitely cancelling and just use one of the very easy pirate apps. Fedup As long as you can side load... Sure. But going from "hidden app in the Play store" to "sideloaded app won't run" is probably on the menu. Wayne Randall I just signed up for Netflix so I could cancel it. I'm part of the group. tim242 You paid them... Richard Markert Hahahahahaha I don't even use Netflix on my phone (screen is too small) so I don't care. But man, the tears and butthurt from the root community is hilarious. Benjamin Walburn You're a very petty child. Richard Markert When something makes me laugh, I point it out. I do that even have a dog in this hunt. I only watch Netflix on my 75" LED TV. I'm just tired of root users smugness. Almost as smug as apple users. Benjamin Walburn You're tired of people being smug in their hobbies, so you gloat about the problems inflicted on them pointlessly? Petty and a hypocrite. Richard Markert What else am I supposed to do to remove the smugness? My name is…. Get a life maybe? Benjamin Walburn Why should you? Is another person's happiness really that painful for you? You already know that they accomplished nothing more than "successfully followed instructions." It seems like your purpose would be better served by targeting that, not just being a jerk. Humbling them is one thing, being an ass is another entirely. tim242 You sound like the petty child. Stomp your foot, becauseyou don't get your way. Benjamin Walburn Not only am I not doing that, I'm not not getting my way, and "stomping​ my foot" is not an example of pettiness. Your wrongness-density is impressive. My name is…. Who beat you as a child? Richard Markert Lol koiulpoi You're on androidpolice.com... making fun of the root community... and unable to see past the end of your nose... Don't you have anything better to do? Richard Markert Actually, no. I read Android police because they have the best coverage of software. koiulpoi I didn't realize I replied to you twice. You're all over this article, with really, nothing better to do, huh? Richard Markert Yeah, I'm bored. I'm probably done stirring shit up anyway, today is water change day on my fish tanks. lomsha Tard Railwayman Are you one of those Samsung Apologists that argue against root and proudly tell everyone about the perfection known as Grace UX... just to install Package Dsabler Pro because... something disturb all "perfectness" of their system? Trying to be an "anti-social elitist" is like proudly use Simple Finder on a Mac and tell everyone that you don't need the regular Finder.;) Richard Markert I use Samsung, but only because it offers the best mix of software and hardware for me. And package disablers are garbage. Railwayman I avoid Samsung like a plague because of Knox 0x1 Warranty Void, Grace UX (TW...) and pretty ugly hardware not to mention the software design, which looks like a cheap toy, both colors, design and all S-This and S-That they preinstall. Don't forget DT Ignite so the carriers can add their share. It is always amusing when the Samsung Apologist proudly claim how good it is to live without root and how "mature Android has become" when they are talking about a heavily modified fork of it. If Samsung could replace Google Play with Galaxy Apps, they would. The only thing restricting them from further modification is the CTS in order to be able to use Play. An unrooted Samsung running Grace? It would be like having a feature phone again. Way too many annoyances and no way of making it more pleasurable since the whole thing is... Samsung. The only area where there are some reminiscence of Android is under the About box. Samsung is a disgrace not to mention a complete parody on the concept of an Android device. Not to mention their followers who recently "spotted" the bezel less display (introduced by Sharp and LG followed by Xiaomi) because... the S 8 got it AND suddenly made it a "requirement". The most kind thing I can say about that brand is this: Samsung is for the Android device and platform what McDonald's is for the thing called food.;) There are way better devices available. Buying a Samsung is like getting a Big Mac (the difference is that the Big Mac buyers doesn't claim its superiority - while Samsung buyers always try to claim how "superior" their devices are). Richard Markert Everything in your first paragraph is purely subjective. I find the design of the Pixel to be ugly, boring and derivative. AOSP design language doesn't appeal to me. I also think Samsung's software suite is better than Google's. My 935U doesn't have DTIgnite, but my 935V does...as does the Verizon branded V20, Moto Turbo2, etc. DTIgnite is a Verizon thing. Bezel less phones are sexy, for sure. That Sharp device was a Sharp device, and the Xiaomi has a CDMA radio so I could use it on Verizon , but just can't justify buying a thousand dollar device from China. It is stupidly gorgeous though. I use Samsung because I like the software design. I like the functionality of the base is and apps, and I like the S-app suite. I really miss my Note 7, and I'll be swapping up to a Note 8 when it's out. Don't get me wrong, Samsung phones have their negatives - chief among them is the fragile design and the screen edge touch rejection sucks ass. But for me, the positives outweigh the negatives. Other phones have bigger negatives for me. No IP68, no uSD card, no wireless charging, no SAMOLED display. Phone preference are always subjective. Somebody will always have a reason to pick one over another. Tell me, if Samsung is a "parody" of the concept of an Android device, what is your description of the perfect Android device? I'm guessing it's the Pixel. Railwayman Pixel is an ugly iPhone clone. The best Android device so far would be something like a Xiaomi Mi Mix running Resurrection Remix or similar ROM or something like a Mi Max but with perfection added through a Snapdragon 835, 256GB storage plus microSDand 6-8GB RAM paired with a 1440p 6.44" display or even 4K. 5000-6000 mAh battery. My Xiaomi Mi Max is excellent but would be even better with the aforementioned hardware (I can't fault is existing hardware but I am taking about a new model). A keyboard flipcover would be a great accessory as well. There are no device yet worthy of the perfect moniker yet but my Max is the best thing so far in my collection beside the Nokia Communicators and HTC TP2 and HD2 and also the Xperia Z Ultra when I do the holistic judgment. IP68? Sony all the way to me if I really insist. MicroSD? No need for a Samsung in order to get it. Yes, Samsung is a kind of a parody of an Android device die to their heavy modifications, restrictive policies, low price /performance ratio, carrier branding and Knox 0x1 Warranty Void. The upcoming OnePlus 5 looks promising - they usually get their things right. MicroSD on that one as well.;) If Samsung make a device without any BS such as restrictions, carrier links paired with good price / performance ratio I would be interested. Let's call it a Note Pro. What I don't like with Samsung are all Apologists making excuses for their policies. I have nothing against them as a company or production. They can make excellent products but their policies stop them right now. It is too much McDonald's mainstream and too little class at this time. Carrier devices are typically too mainstream than the unlocked ones. MadMartigan What are are you, seven? me me A primary reason to root is to run adblock because Google is way too greedy. So the irony, Google's greed means there's less reason to pay for NetFlix. Let me guess... shall we? Google Play Movies still works right...? Oh yes, so long as Google makes their money.... tim242 I block ads with Adguard. No root required. Mike | Homeless On Wheels People still use Netflix? Bit Torrent is your friend. dizel123 Exactly. Everyone should stop using Netflix. Not sure how I'm gonna get the shows i currently watch on Netflix from bit torrent since they won't be made anymore once Netflix is shut down, but at least I'll have my bit torrent friend tim242 Some people like to do things properly. Railwayman You mean - Do it with DRM? You can't buy whatever device you want because a content provider disagree. You can't use the system you want because a content provider disagree. You can't use the app you want because a content provider disagree. I need a lot of apps, ads and limitations for the so called "proper way" . The "improper way" is Samsung free, ad free and bloat free - and I don't need several apps because I have just one or two streaming apps, one media player, one book reader and so on. Fast and efficient system to boot. I think I prefer to do things "improperly". Richard Markert >The "improper way" is Samsung free, ad free and bloat free - and I don't need several apps because I have just one or two streaming apps, one media player, one book reader and so on. Fast and efficient system to boot. *sigh* I bet you think deleting the APKs from /system actually gives you more space in /data, too. Railwayman Perhaps you can tell me the benefit of having Kindle, Kobo and Nook instead of MoonReader for everything. The benefits of having an uprooted system, Netflix, Hulu and a couple of apps for different cable services instead of having just one media center would also be interesting to know more about. When we are at it: Why would I want to use a 3GB+ Samsung ROM when Resurrection Remix are 600 MB and the G-Apps around 340 MB? Richard Markert I dont use any of those. Phones are too small for media consumption. I don't have any video streaming or playback apps on my phone. Nor do I have book readers, but why wouldnt I want Kindle? It's the only way to access the Amazon library... Oh wait, I forgot, you do that believe in compensating content creators. Resurrection remix, really? If I put that on my S7 edge, I'd be wiping out half the hardware's capabilities in one blow. No Samsung pay, no edge panels, no pro mode camera, no AOD, no game tools, no GearVR. And im sure none of the little things I've come to expect in my UI, like direct calling and sliding a contact to call/txt. But I can move the clock to the other side of the notification shade, woohoo! Oh and does the installer for RR rom repartition the file system? Because if not, /system will still be 3gb, not 600mb. And on top of that, I'm immediately reminded of iOS when I looked at their screenshots. Railwayman So RR looks like iOS? Interesting. It looks like Android with Material Design on my device. I buy Kindle books but send them through a plug-in since the Kindle app pretty much suck in comparison with MoonReader. Sometimes I also buy from Google Play Books and it is also a trip through the plug-in for them and then into the MoonReader library. You see - DRM is a stupidity that must go way unless they create a device wide scheme so any app can authenticate and show or play back the content. I understand that Samsung phones are too small for media consumption. A 6.44-7 inch display is different - it works comfortably without the heft of a 10-12 inch tablet. Small displays below 6-6.3 inches are just too small. So your listed features of your Samsung are hardware? They certainly sound like software to me. Or do you seriously believe that Samsung use co-processors in their device like Commodore did on the Amiga? I can assure you that your Samsung contain standard hardware with a lot of subcontracted components, especially in the US market where they even use Qualcomm CPUs. Samsung Pay? Why would I use an OEM dependent payment system? My credit cards follow a standard, why should I pick myself into a specific device OEM just to pay? It makes no sense. It is like having a car that only runs on Citgo gas or a 4" Visa card requiring different terminals than my 4.5" MasterCard. Mobile payments will be a thing when a standard are in place. Payment systems requiring me to lock myself into a specific OEM just suck. Edge panels? Don't see the need. Don't like Edge displays with their optical side effects. Flat display or just slight roundness on the edges like the BlackBerry PRIV here. Pro Mode Camera? I prefer to have the Open Camera API so any app can get RAW from the sensor and do their thing rather than locking myself into the default camera app. I prefer Camera FV-5 or A Better Camera etc. The Snap Camera is good too. Always on display? Can set it up on my device but don't see the need when there are things such as Active Display and a lot of other options. Game tools? I don't see any problems with gaming on other Android versions so I just don't see what Samsung can add in this regard. Gear VR? Why would I want to strap my device to my face when there are dedicated VR headsets available for gaming consoles and computers? I certainly prefer to have a full headset rather than using my device as one. Call features? They could be good but carrier calling is old fashioned. I use Google Voice instead and wouldn't consider going back to carrier talk and text. Don't see any benefit with having a phone number tied to a carrier of SIM card. Having more than one for different purposes on the same device without SIM dependency is the modern way. I don't know if RR repartition Samsung devices so you have to check XDA. That brand is probably the worst when it comes to ROMs anyway and a lot of my dislike of them are related to that particular issue. Samsung is nothing more than the Big Mac of Android devices and no Gear VR or Samsung Pay (it is like having a McDonald's Pay) really change anything. A mainstream device with mainstream design with too many round edges and corners not to say fragile, batteries that wear out fast due to lower quality and fast charge (which stresses the cells heavily), a software design looking "something" , bloat ware, carrier BS such as bloat ware and also the price model, Knox and root/ROM restrictions, locked bootloadern - the list goes on and on. Mainstream degenerated art is what Samsung represents. But I know the existence of people who don't believe in freedom of choice other than the freedom of buying their Samsung from their carrier and then happily oblige and reduction imposed to them all the way down to the SIM card dependent phone number and roaming charges when they travel.;) They also consider Samsung Pay to be the best thing ever - a payment system that only work on a particular OEM. It really is like a car that require Citgo gas and is unable to run on Exxon or Esso fuel. Samsung just are the Big Mac of Android devices. There are just nothing "classy" over such a carrier mainstream brand. If you want to know what luxury are? Look at Vertu. derp_cookies So I agree this is a dumb move but everyone is overreacting by threatening to pirate content. This is a niche problem as less people root now, especially since Android pay won't work when you do it. So Netflix isn't any less accessible than it was before. I watch 99% of Netflix at home on my Roku. Luxferro It's not just rooting. My Nexus 6P is running stock google rom, no root, w/ just unlocked bootloader, and netflix is gone in my play store. Not that I watch TV on my phone... but my shield tv is also unlocked... so it's probably just a matter of time. Roh_Mish Dammit Netflix, you make me want to go popcorn time route. My current primary phone and my iPad are what I use to watch netflix and both of them is stock so i don't have anything to worry about but this just feels wrong. Between this and Amazon not releasing the TV app for my sony TV, which they support outside, popcorn time (and in extension piracy) just seems easier. Vivek Rameses This is why we have piracy. Miguel Angel But ...why? occono Distributors want Netflix to stop any possibility of making DRM-Free backups on the content. Railwayman Good luck with that. If it can be played, it can be recorded. As long as the Netflix content is visible somewhere a copy can be recorded so again, good luck with blocking. Mariano Moreira Even more strange is while Netflix app is removed from Playstore, Netflix VR is still.in Playstore. Manually flashing Factory Image for Google Pixel is how I get me OS updates and I choose to leave bootloader unlocked, rather than relocking every month.(which would include full wipe) So I guess they don't care about security for the few users whom might use Netflix VR with Daydream compatible device? tehboogieman I'm not familiar with the Pixel, but almost every Nexus device lets you lock without wiping all your data. Maybe that requires root though, I really don't understand the details on how it works, but hopefully you can find a way to do it. Mariano Moreira To clarify: In order for me to install Factory Image every month, I need to have Bootloader unlocked. Doing the Factory unlock will wipe the device. Locking the device doesn't wipe the device, but Factory unlocking the bootloader will wipe the device. tehboogieman Yeah, sorry I wasn't more specific. I use an app called BootUnlocker. It lets you lock and unlock the bootloader without wiping at will. Since an app can do this, I'm assuming that it can be done via ADB. Also it might only work on older devices, but maybe there's a way to replicate this action on newer devices as well Mariano Moreira I don't understand why Google is promoting Security by having the device fully-locked, yet still relies on ADB fastboot unlock/OEM Unlock commands to flash factory images? saf1927 Why are using factory images when Google provides OTA images too, and these don't require an unlocked bootloader, nor a wipe? jdrch It's not just Netflix. The HDHomeRun Prime app doesn't work on rooted 7.0+ devices either. Jsilvermist Good to know, will no longer recommend Netflix to anyone when I'm asked... James F News flash: when you explain to most normal people why you don't recommend Netflix, they won't care, because it doesn't affect them. D13H4RD2L1V3 This is stupid. I had to root my phone to be able to hide the navbar at any time I want and also to gain better battery management controls and other stuff that I sorely wished Google had added to stock Android way sooner. And I was considering a Netflix subscription. No longer...... Sruly J I know it's not fully a solution which is "worth it", but the app Custom Navigation Bar offers the ability to hide status bar/narbar without root. Although like you said, you had other reasons to root, so... Diar I pay for Netflix so I can watch the content any way I want guilt free, whether that's their app or other locations on the Internet. F their VPN blocking and DRM. If they make their app impossible to use, I just won't use it. They'll still get my money but they will lose any data/tracking since I'll still be watching their shows, just outside of their ecosystem. Dummies. ReedSolomon Between the SJW nonsense like Bill Nye, the ipv6 tunnel blocking (rather than simply defaulting to ipv4), increases in price, less and less quality content, and now this, I see little reason to keep paying for Netflix. robogo I understand Netflix' reasons, I really do - they need to protect their property and investment. But I can't really say I understand the way they're doing this. This is a good way to alienate the small percentage of power users who root their devices for various, but perfectly valid and understandable reasons. And no, this will not make me cancel my membership as long as the app works. Cancelling membership is a silly, overblown reaction to what is, in my mind, a minor nuisance. D13H4RD2L1V3 I personally just find it a dumb move. Seems like an easy way out. Dmitri Smirnov > perfectly valid and understandable reasons. And what reason would that be? Preventing people from ripping their content? Doesn't stop them in the slightest, root-detection in circumvented rather easily as well as safety net, we have PokemonGo to thank for that - a lot of people were motivated to crack it and they succeeded. > Cancelling membership is a silly, overblown reaction to what is, in my mind, a minor nuisance. Cancelling membership is valid form of feedback to the company, that trying to tell it's customers that they are not allowed to own their device that they paid their money for, if they want to watch a movie. robogo You misunderstood, it seems. A perfectly valid and understandable reason to root one's device would be, e.g. Xposed framework, theming support, tethering, backing up stuff with Titanium Backup, etc. Please read my comment once again. EowynCarter Well, if and when it stops working on my phone, what will be a major nuisance. robogo Agreed. I'll have to find another way then. But I'll deal with that when the time comes. Manbearpig I member when netflix released there app for Android and they did the same thing. I would just download the app and be good to go. After awhile though I stop rooting I miss it sometimes Cyber_Akuma I warned people when Pokemon GO of all things had a surprise update that silently added SafetyNet that this garbage was going to become more and more common. Mario RUN uses it too, and now Netflix.... soon apps everywhere are going to add SafetyNet and block rooted devices as standard practice. Google has been incredibly hostile towards people who actually want to own or have control over their devices or even their PC Software over the last few years. And over the last year google has been making SafetyNet more and more harsh, now even tripping if your BOOTLOADER is unlocked even if your phone is not rooted. Pokemon GO and Mario RUN were a small crowd, but I hope after Netflix of all things starts using it (and make no mistake, this is just the beginning) that people will finally push back against Google's hostility towards rooted users. EowynCarter Yeah. Or I might seriously consider going the iOS way. Though iOS would pose other problems. (Bye paylib) BillPosters I rooted my Android phone to get rid of the annoying camera shutter sound, and to prevent apps from stealing my contacts, and to basically take control of my device rather than letting Google run the whole show, and because of that I can't update Netflix? Good riddance Netflix. iKon I'm pretty sure you can go in the camera settings and take of the camera shutter sound?.... .. In some region-specific firmware versions or certain devices you can't do that. Railwayman There is a better solution: Declare the device a DRM free zone and use everything else. DRM to me is "Don't Restrict Me!" and an excellent reason to give certain companies the middle finger telling them to just go and F themselves. The most ironic thing here is that removing Netflix or using DRM otherwise doesn't stop piracy. On the contrary - By buying and using DRM content you get to travel in the cargo hold with no heating while the pirating consumer get first class service: more content, no restrictions, no copyright trailers or ads before the movie start and stop on. Even better: They can use whatever apps or ROMs they want. Would I unroot my device in order to get DRM content onboard? No way!!! If Netflix are so scared - block the client on Mac OS X and Windows et al. Piracy doesn't usually happen with an Android device as a source but rather computers and HDCP rippers. Another thing also to the DRM companies: Everything that can be played back can be recorded! (Good old piracy saying) Netflix out, Fusion with Exodus, SALTS and Phoenix in. Kodi with Rapier skin is much nicer than the Netflix client and Trakt integration make this way a much better one than going down the DRM route, sitting with an uprooted stock ROM and Netflix.;) TechJunkie198 ? netflix isn't scared. the studios require the drm. and netflix isn't concerned with the small percent of users who root their devices. Railwayman Doesn't matter. Go and enjoy your DRM services.;) DRM is a pest and that is why the pirating community offer a superior product. It is easier and more hassle free to just put Netflix where they belong and use Exodus et al or MovieBox or Terrarium TV and so on. To those who now consider unrooting because of Netflix: Just don't - use other services instead. Richard Markert So when everybody takes your advice and uses a service that doesn't compensate anybody in the content creation business, and all the high-quality media is gone, don't go crying about there being nothing good to steal anymore, k? Railwayman Even better: DRM and proprietary vendor lock in are scrapped and replaced by standards. If they want some kind of protection - make it device wide and linked to the account signed in so playback works in different apps - only thing needed is to call the system wide authentication system. I am against DRM and vendor restrictions. Original content without any of the BS is what the world need. Piracy is a symptom of several problematic things such as geo restrictions, root restrictions and the failed idea of the "right of no distribution" - i.e. the content exist but stubborn companies deny distribution using silly arguments. I always remove DRM from purchased content in order to have full control including the basic right of using whatever app or equipment for playback. Richard Markert Start developing the solution, and start a content creation company that can compete with the big boys when it comes to quality content. Or, you can sit around and whine online about the content creators not wanting the people who don't follow rules to play in their gated sandbox and get mad when you crawl over the fence. Railwayman I take that you like DRM and proprietary vendor lock-in. It is easy to avoid the gated sandbox so no need to whine. It is easier to just fire up Exodus rather than relocking the bootloader and flashing a stock ROM or remove SuperSU in favor of Magisk just to be able to get Netflix. DRM is such a waste of time. It's not necessary to develop a new service since the content are available DRM free already. Standards for media and books etc does exist or did you miss EPUB, PDF, AAC, MP3, MP4 and so on? Perhaps you prefer such a format as ZNO or Apple modified EPUB that only works with iBooks? saf1927 Magisk seems to do the trick. Helios What about my non-rooted OnePlus One? It's also listed as incompatible.. '-_- 天地人 Don't OnePlus devices run a custom ROM and have unlocked bootloaders? Android Developer How can they block people who root the device from installing the app? The play store doesn't have this filter. Maybe after the install they do this check? Richard Markert If you're really an Android Developer, you would know that SafetyNet is what's doing this "behind the scenes". Android Developer I'm talking about the article. They say that Netflix blocks rooted devices, and I know that this isn't an option on the developer console. Google doesn't have anything related to rooted devices there. Ezio I have about 200 original blu-ray disks, go to cinema, and I'm Netflix subscriber. Now I won't get app updates (or even worse I won't be able to use it in the future) just because I like to use my custom rom. Thank you. This is really a bad move. AdjustedFlow I thought netflix was about providing a better service than piracy. Now they're literally pushing me back to piracy. What the heck? Dany If for "root" they mean administrator privileges, don't we already have that on windows 10? So why Netflix doesn't block desktop version too? P.S. by the way...whatever man! I was using Kodi more than this crap anyway... Miku is Best Vocaloid This means Netflix won't be getting my business anymore. Paul Sterling No worries here, when you're legit. Take my money, I'm not cheap. Give me a service, I'll pay you. I don't need to rob. What am I? 13 living with my mom using Napster? Naw, grew up. Don't have any Tim foil hats. My wallet grew up too. ast00 This is a dick move that could have been avoided. If they want us to pirate their content instead, we will pirate their content. We tried doing it the legal way, but they didn't allow it. Their problem, not ours. EowynCarter Umf. **checks google play ** No longer compatible with my nexus 6 . But nexus 4 still ok. For crying out loud! I'm not rooted or using a custom ROM. Pyramid Power netflix is just losing money. it's saying to those people, 'go to thepiratebay!' RemiV2 I guess I'll just keep torrenting then. Thanks, Netflix.

Netflix is a client app. If I can, with a rooted phone, fake my subscription, or somehow cause a major security issue, that is not a problem with me, that is a problem with you pushing out a vulnerable app to millions of users. Sure, it would be my fault for exploiting it, but there is no-one but you who managed to put the problem in place. A CLIENT app should not be anything but a front-end representation of an API run by your servers. The CLIENT should have nothing but a CLIENT ID to use with the API. The CLIENT should NOT be able to change JACK SHIT with the API, it should only be able to get search results, get access to encrypted streams, etc. If your client CAN change JACK SHIT (which one could assume is true, since you are so actively hiding your code) then you have a major security vulnerability... This is a problem with your code, not anyone's rooted device... Hell, you don't even need a rooted device to access the applications code, just download an APK of the app, extract it, and decompile it... Jesus netflix, get your shit straight you bendy pos... BahnStormer Netflix is used more on tablets and TV boxes, these tend to be used for several years longer than phones and even Google now only updates their devices for <2 years (Samsung / streamer manufacturer's do this even less!)... We HAVE to run the likes of Lineage if we want the devices to be secure! Bye bye Netflix, even Amazon Video lets us use rooted devices! jcopernicus People don't understand IP and lambast a company protecting it. Of course. RemixedCat well they got rid of 5 star ratings, deleted tons of shows I was in the middle of, and the roku app is hella slow and takes 10 freakin minutes to load (by comparison my OS install from power on to desktop was 8 minutes on my samsung 850 500GB SSD!!) Tobi I'm running LineageOS on my Oneplus One to lengthen the lifespan of my device. Why must I be punished for that? I'm going back to pirating content. StankyChikin Possible that the movie industry is pushing this? SkullOne Shhhhh. Don't use logic here. It's not allowed. It's simply easier to blame Netflix and believe that they have a vendetta against the teeny tiny, itsy bitsy amount of root users out there! StankyChikin Forgive me plz lol username_not_valid This isnt about Netflix, its about its content providers. There is this notion that you can copy files and therefore pirate content if you are rooted. We all know its rubbish, Netflix probably knows its rubbish, but that doesn't change anything. If Netflix wants shows, its has to abide by its license agreements. There is really nothing Netflix, Amazon, Sky or any other streaming service can do about it. The fact that almost all pirate content comes from PCs and HDCP by-pass devices doesnt mean a thing. TedPhillips at least in practice, unlocking your bootloader/being rooted has no impact on your widevine support level. now, i'm not sure if the oem could supply a high-level drm library on a pre-rooted device, due to agreements, but modification after the point of sale is a different matter. meanwhile, keep on streaming netflix on your 'rooted' computer - gasp!~ Richard Markert >meanwhile, keep on streaming netflix on your 'rooted' computer - gasp!~ I don't even need an admin account to steal Netflix on my PC. Since the Windows 10 app and browsers BOTH work over analog, all I need is an inline box with a DSUB VGA connector and simply capture the entire output from the VGA port. Valerie Frye-Preter Did they do this because of the stolen season 5 of Orange is the New Black? TedPhillips wasn't that stolen before it was available for streaming? so i don't see how it could be. TedPhillips when the device can be retroactively uncertified, as safetynet mutates over time, that's a step beyond the usual forced obsolescence of artificially short software support windows. now instead of buying a new phone every 18-24 months, it could be literally whenever they feel like moving the goalposts. Mike Hunt I don't understand. I am a Netflix subscriber, but will probably have to unsubscribe now since I bought a rooted Chinese mediabox for my TV. This sucks, as I liked and supported NetFlix's business model. Richard Markert Which box do you have? Mike Hunt One of these https://www.aliexpress.com/wholesale?catId=0&initiative_id=SB_20170514131212&SearchText=media+box+mini+m8s Brock Reed I'm not even getting the "not compatible" message, it's just not showing up at all. Ajmobileguru First DirecTV Now and now Netflix. I dont see the point. As if rooted users were pirating the streams or movies. Rooted users on non-nexus/pixel devices already were getting only 480p because of widewine crap and now this. Anunnaki This is why people switch to apps like Popcorn Time and Terrarium TV. Biga173rd Popcorn time still works? Anunnaki When I last checked few months ago, it was working. No idea about the current situation though. Biga173rd Okay Erin Andrews Oh that's easy, they block my device I cancel my subscription. Say goodbye to my 15 dollars a month. piggynuts Stopped playing Pokemon, stopped using Snapchat, next to go is Netflix. I refuse to say bye to root. BobButtons Magisk. While some say it's hit and miss with Pokemon GO (idk, I don't play it) it's never not worked for me with Snapchat/Android Pay/Mario Run. cliff_dangers Why does everyone freak out about a rooted phone but my PC which is wide open is not a problem? What makes smartphones so special? Doro Manekia ΝετΦλξ Ανάθεμα σου.Χα χα χα Το Μαααακα. Bewear I am not that upset because I rarely use Netflix on my mobile, I am upset because this kind of blocking will become a trend. BoFiS ugh, fuck you, Netflix, I pay for your serve, LET ME USE IT ON MY PHONE A.M There are some many ways around that LAME NETFLIX - Showbox Kodi Firestick with Kodi I can't see the point of Netflix when we have so MANY better apps out there that kill Netflix ErectBipedal That'll teach them filthy pirates for trying to pay us money!.... wait.... -Netflix probably Zxyon Rhysivz What could users with unlocked/rooted phones do with the Netflix app that other users can't? Loco Mole Netflix content isn't that much better these days, so if they choose to distinguish themselves by being a d*ck to consumers who care about using our devices the way we want to, then f u too, Netflix, I got plenty of other legit streaming content. Fedup Let's see... Piracy: $0.00, no ads, no DRM, no device/location/time restrictions Legit: $$$, ads out the as$, DRM limiting options, shows locked to specific devices, locations, etc. Keep on making the decision easier for us, Netflix. xyz Fortunately, the Pirate Bay is accessible from all devices and regions without any geo-blocking. berserksgangr Well, my Nexus 7 with Lineage it's not working even without root (error 9) Nick Riley This is utterly stupid! Corvus Dove Remember that time that making things more difficult for software and media pirates through DRM while possibly messing with legitimate customers paid off and prevented piracy? Me either. Asbjørn The problem here is that most users root their phone to get the updates that their OEM doesn't want to make available. If Android had proper updates, rooting would not be so necessary. Patel Nisha Root user here. How do I use Magisk for this? I have it installed and new to the Magisk(haven't had a rooted phone in a while)? Keletor Does it stop you from sideloading it? I mean really, if you are rooting your phone you most likely will find a workaround. Luxferro Not yet, but you can be sure the app will stop working in the future. Znuff The download feature is not working for me anymore. And the 5.x app is not working at all, just says I need to install the 4.x one (redirects me to the download page) Tim Get Roku tv or a fire stick cause no issues there and it isn't through Google then Biga173rd People still use Netflix? mlauzon And this is exactly how you piss off your end users! Doug Rogers I guess I'll have to unroot - whoops, Android 4.2 Awesome. Luxferro Don't forget to leave your 1 star review.

The only way I can watch overseas now is using Mediahint.com - nothing else works. Luxferro Just use usenet. They are forcing their legit customers to piracy... DDS This move will not stop people from pirating their content, it will encourage it. Exactly the opposite of what they're trying to achieve. But tell that to the a**hats who control the money... Ubelsteiner And thus, Plex and Kodi become even more popular, as Netflix drives a nail into it's own coffin. Znuff http://i.imgur.com/LG3dXc4.jpg http://i.imgur.com/eNeuPCD.jpg Can not use the latest version on my device, it sends me to download the 4.x version. When I try that, the latest 4.x version has Downloads disabled for me (it used to work on this device). US Patriot No worries. I can live without Netflix, but I will NOT live without full control of my devices and data. Ricardo A. Fragoso For those who want root at all cost there's still a chance to get movies with ChromeCast Support... Google "TerrariumTV". :D You are welcome. :D Sir Doogie Houser M.D.Esq. 200 Mobile devices are now a vice.The rules,whether stringent or lenient,if there's demand,the market will fill the demand.Plain and simple.So to Mr.Gable,your wrong buttercup. Nick Coad I can guarantee you that Netflix doesn't make these choices willingly. The production companies they purchase shows off are notoriously backward when it comes to technology and unfortunately Netflix relies on them to survive.

The latest entry comes from Lyft, which has signed a partnership with Waymo. The second company is already testing self-driving cars on public roads, and they operate with technology developed by Google. In a way, the company with the mustache logo came later than Uber in this field of driverless ride-hailing, but it may have a shot at supremacy due to Google’s technology. Apparently, the deal between Waymo and Lyft was signed for some time, but the company insiders who had revealed it under cover of anonymity could not reveal details about it until both parties were ready to make it official. Eventually, both companies told representatives of the New York Times that they had signed a partnership regarding self-driving cars. The deal will involve multiple pilot projects that will attempt to bring this technology into the mainstream. Lyft already has a ride-hailing app with plenty of users on hand, and Waymo has the technology, but needed a customer base willing to try new things. An ongoing partnership with General Motors (an investor in Lyft) has led to a deal that will involve self-driving Chevrolet Bolt models in the next few years. At this point, it is unclear if Waymo will use the GM cars or its existing fleet of Chrysler Pacifica Hybrids under its partnership with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles. The latter is not an exclusive deal, and the autonomous car business is already discussing with other potential partners. It is fair to note that Waymo is already experimenting with an autonomous car program in some parts of Phoenix, Arizona. The partnership would bring Google’s driverless cars to new riders, who may not have been in the area served in the limited-access deal that Waymo rolled out in the state. Eventually, driverless cars will probably be able to replace all human drivers of ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft, but the conclusion leaves us with a few questions. First of all, we are curious what will taxi drivers have against the robots that will operate the driverless ride-hailing cars, which would have lower costs than using humans who need to eat, sleep, and earn money for their efforts. Secondly, what will happen to the humans who drive people with either Uber or Lyft once the apps switch to driverless cars? At this point, nobody knows if robots will bring an end to cab drivers, the ride-hailing part of the “sharing economy,” or to none of the above. waymo lyft self-driving cars autonomous vehicle driverless cars   Mercedes-Benz Model Nomenclature is Getting Ridiculous Ten Cheap Car Hacks That May Help You Deal With Day-To-Day Issues Five Lightest All-Wheel-Drive SUVs Available In Europe in 2017 Could Volkswagen Group's Electric Plans Include Ducati?

The new in-car infotainment system will allow users to install apps from the Android App Store, Volvo said, which it hopes will let the driving denizens access “connected and predictive services in and around the car.” Google’s platform and services will enhance the user experience by enabling more personalisation possibilities, while Android will offer increased flexibility from a development perspective,” said Henrik Green, senior R&D veep of the Volvo Car Group, in a canned statement. Bloomberg reported that the Android infotainment system will support touchscreen functions and be bundled with Google Maps and Spotify, among others. It will also have voice control features, so your screams of fear and loathing at other road users will be heard only by a dispassionate computer with no interest in its immediate demise. Just to enhance your peace of mind, it is reported that the Android infotainment system will take “over the underlying software on the car.” How much of the underlying software will be under Android's control, we dread to think. Hopefully, the safety critical parts are firewalled off from the generic operating system, but who knows these days. Google has done a lot to shore up the security of Android, but it's not exactly a safety critical system. You may want to steer well clear of new Volvos in the coming years. Audi will also form part of the Android connected car rollout, according to the financial newswire. The software will be competing against Blackberry’s QNX, as rolled out by Ford, and Apple’s CarPlay. Google’s previous stab at connected car tech didn’t go so well. Android Auto was last seen on El Reg after being accused of broadcasting so much engine data to various parties that Porsche allegedly dropped it. ® Tips and corrections 26 Comments MORE Google Android Volvo Connected Car Sign up to our Newsletter Get IT in your inbox daily Subscribe More from The Register Google's PHP API client has XSS vulnerability Patch promised Google opens patent pool for Android Protects against trolls maybe.

Name: Subject: Message: Google Assistant app for iOS rumored to be officially revealed soon Newsby John Callaham14 hours ago 6 461 17 Google Assistant may be expanding its reach to another operating system. A new report says that Google’s voice command digital assistant will be coming “soon” to Apple’s iOS. The official reveal could come this week as part of the 2017 Google I/O developer conference. See also: Google Assistant in Allo: The top features you should know March 8, 2017 The report comes from Android Police, citing unnamed sources. The story didn’t have much in the way of details about the iOS version of Google Assistant, but it did say that it will “likely” combine its voice command features with the chat functions found on the Google Allo version of Assistant. Google first launched Google Assistant in October 2016 with the launch of Android 7.0 Nougat and its Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones, and it was also included with its Google Home connected speaker. Assistant has since expanded its reach to more devices, including all Android Marshmallow and Nougat smartphones. It is also coming to some Android TV devices and earlier today, the company confirmed that it will be built into Android for some car infotainment systems.  Oddly, the company confirmed a few weeks ago that Google Assistant would not be enabled for Android tablets. If this story is accurate, it will be very interesting to see how Google Assistant works on Apple’s iPhone, which already has its own Siri voice assistant built into iOS. Microsoft has also launched a version of its own digital assistant, Cortana, for both iOS and Android. Stay tuned as we will have lots more first-hand reports of Google’s big announcements as part of our coverage of Google I/O 2017 this week, starting on Wednesday, May 17.

What am I saying - of course you have. It’s pretty much impossible to not watch those fast-paced culinary transformations (especially when they involve things like ice cream churro bowls and mozzarella stick onion rings). Why are they so appealing? They’re short, they’re engaging, and they’re the kind of content that today’s consumer demands. Within half a minute, you’re back to your regularly scheduled social media scrolling (and probably thinking about your next meal). You hear it all the time: People want bite-sized, digestible content. They want blog posts that don’t require them to scroll for too long. They want videos they can watch during commercial breaks. Why? Some point to the declining human attention span. A Microsoft study found that the average human attention span has now dropped to eight seconds, down from 12 seconds in 2000. If you haven’t heard, that’s shorter than the attention span of a goldfish. So, in a world of short content - and even shorter attention spans - is there any use for long-form content in your marketing strategy? Yes — if you do it right. Here’s why. It boosts your SEO While consumers may say they prefer short content, longer content actually performs better in internet searches. Research has shown that Google ranks long-form content higher in search results - the average first-page result on Google contains 1,890 words - about twice the length of a typical blog post. But it’s not just length that matters. Another study revealed that content considered topically relevant (as measured by MarketMuse) usually receives higher rankings. While a brief blog post could, in theory, be very focused and written on a single topic, it’s not likely that it would offer an in-depth look at the subject. It positions you as an industry authority Anyone can do some quick Googling and write a cursory overview on almost any topic, but the companies that can produce a cutting-edge guide, eBook, or white paper - they stand out as the ones who really know what they’re talking about. By publishing long-form content that does a deeper dive on the subject, your customers learn that you don’t just have basic industry knowledge; you’re an expert. It conveys that you have the experience and have done the research to have a command of the subject that your competitors lack. That’s what leads your prospects and customers to trust you and to come back to your website for more content (and, ideally, to eventually purchase your product or service). It’s a lead generator People expect (rightly so) to read blog posts without providing anything in return. Long-form content, on the other hand, doesn’t have to be given away for free. In fact, it’s often used as a bargaining chip to get information from prospects. They want the information in your eBook, so they tend to be more willing to hand over their personal information in exchange for the goods. Then, you have the opportunity to nurture them with additional content and guide them down the marketing funnel toward becoming a customer. Plus, it gives you something hefty to promote through lead generation emails or paid ads, if you choose to go that route. But even if you know why long-form content should be an essential piece of your content marketing strategy, that’s only half the battle - the other half, of course, is doing it right. Sure, you could hammer our 3,000 words on some topic related to your industry and call it a day, but that’s not going to guarantee success. To make sure you develop your long-form content in a way that captures your audience’s attention, you have to: Know your audience If you don’t know what your audience wants to read, chances are slim that you’ll produce something of value to them. Ask yourself: What are they interested in? What challenges keep them up at night? What do they want to learn more about? You can write about what you think they’re interested in all day, but if that topic isn’t actually important to them, they’re not going to download or read your content. Want to know a great way to find these things out? Ask. It’s OK to go to a few members of your target audience and ask them about the challenges they’re facing or what topics they’d be interested in learning more about. Another great avenue for getting those types of answers: Ask your sales team. They can probably tell you all day long about the pain points, objections, and desires of your prospects and customers.  Voilà - relevant topics, right at your fingertips. Know how your audience is evolving Are you interested in the same things today as you were two years ago? Probably not. Over the span of a couple years, a lot of things can change. In any industry, there’s probably new technology, new research, new processes, new challenges - all sorts of things that change the way your audience now has to approach their work. If you’re not keeping up with the way your audience and their interests are changing, your content is going to be irrelevant before it’s even published. Think beyond the content To some, long-form content can inspire mental images of plain white pages covered in Times New Roman font. And very few people are going to want to read that kind of publication. That’s why the use of good design is so important. The placement and spacing of your content, images, charts, and other graphic elements can completely transform your content into something that draws your audience in and keeps them there. As marketing and technology evolves, however, you also have to think about new ways to present that information. Interactive content, for example, does a good job of breaking up long chunks of content and presenting them in a way that engages your readers, helps you collect valuable information about your audience, and gives them more of the content they want (and lets them skip over what they don’t). Even in the midst of dwindling attention spans, that kind of innovation can help you create effective long-form content and grow and engaged audience. While some research may suggest that your audience can’t handle more than bite-sized chunks of content at any given time, there’s also plenty of proof that your readers still want thorough, well-researched, long-form content. Give them what they want, and you’ll reap the benefits.

Photo: Workplace Dynamics Image 54 of 54 Secret revealed: Google buys Troy startup's name for VR goggles 1 / 54 Back to Gallery The two-year-old Troy virtual reality startup Spaceout.VR discovered an innovative way to raise much-needed cash to sustain its operations - by selling off its name to Google. A year ago, Spaceout.VR, which sells virtual reality goggles and has developed its own virtual reality app, sold off its original name, Daydream.io, to Google for $850,000. Spaceout.VR is currently trying to raise as much as $100,000 in stock through Netcapital, an online crowdsourcing web site. But it would be hard-pressed to raise as much as it did by doing business with Google. As part of their financial disclosures to potential investors, Spaceout.VR executives revealed they had sold off the Daydream.io and Daydream.VR trademarks, plus related intellectual property such as web site URLs, for $850,000 in May 2016. On May 12, 2016, Google acquired the trademarks, according to documents obtained by the Times Union. The money was regarded as a "windfall" for the company, which only had $38,000 in revenue last year and had only raised $159,000 in capital before that. The deal was essential to Google as well. Google's virtual reality platform and its new line of VR goggles are marketed under the Daydream name. The secret deal with Google has been kept under wraps until now probably since the trademarks were transferred to Google through a private investigator based in Arizona named Cliff Petrovsky.

Announced today, these two auto makers will be building Android into their next-generation of vehicles, and they will be showcasing these at Google I/O later this week in Mountain View. Audi, Volvo and of course Google, are hoping that navigation from your smartphone on the big screen will become the norm, rather than the exception. And this new system would allow you to use Spotify, Google Play Music, Google Maps, and other Google services without connecting your smartphone. This is similar to the concept that Google showed off last year at Google I/O with Maserati, where the entire car was running on Android, thanks to their partnership with Qualcomm and Maserati. This year, Google is a step closer to making it a reality. Audi and Volvo’s focus on integrating Android Auto into their next generation of vehicles will see a future-forward direction when it comes to in-car infotainment systems. Drivers of upcoming vehicles from these two manufacturers should soon be able to enjoy the seamless control of the air conditioning system, windows, sunroof and other aspects of the vehicle, hunting down places using Google Maps, enjoying one’s favorite music on services like Spotify, or even engaging the service of Google Assistant, all without the need for an Android-powered smartphone in the vehicle. The growth of Android Auto since its announcement at Google I/O three years ago has been phenomenal, with more than 300 different car models supporting Android Auto in one form or another today. Aftermarket stereo systems also comprise of another sizable Android Auto market. If the vehicle you drive is not compatible with Android Auto, many Android-powered smartphones will be able to take advantage of the Android Auto app, where a familiar interface that consists of large buttons with voice control capability is present on the smartphone’s screen. Android Auto does look as though it has a very bright path ahead, and there is always Apple’s CarPlay as a rival to help it maintain its competitive, evolutionary edge.

Can Google's new watches save Android Wear? Video 3 Things I want to see at Google I/O The battle for AI supremacy is no longer about which device you want to buy. First Microsoft’s Cortana made the leap from Windows to the Android lock screen, and Android followed up by integrating Alexa into its shopping app. But now things are starting to get really interesting as Google reportedly readies a major push onto iOS. According to Android Police, Google is planning to release a standalone Assistant app on iOS, with an announcement possibly coming at I/O this week. According to the report, “The app would likely feature a blend of the “chat” style functionality in the Google Allo version of Assistant and the voice-controlled version found on Android,” but site cautions that “details are scant.” Assistant on iOS would put some serious pressure on Siri. While it wouldn’t be integrated as deeply as Apple’s AI, Assistant would shine a spotlight on the many things Siri can’t do, like play games, show search results for things it doesn’t know, and speak conversationally. For example, if you ask Google Assistant who the chairman of Amazon is, it will tell you that it’s Jeff Bezos, like Siri. But if you then ask, “How much is he worth,” it will know that you are still speaking about Bezos. Siri, however, will start a new query. Google I/O kicks off Wednesday morning, and we’ll be glued to the keynote to see if this rumor comes to fruition. Now we’re talking: Google I/O would be an ideal venue for the release of Assistant on iOS. Last year Google launched its new chatbot to the world, and over the past 12 months has been working to bring it to as many phones and devices as possible. But an iPhone app would seriously up the stakes in the battle between Assistant and Siri, especially with the rumor that Apple is planning to release its own Google Home competitor at WWDC.

You Can’t Get The Netflix App On A Rooted Android Phone Anymore Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share You Can’t Get The Netflix App On A Rooted Android Phone Anymore Image courtesy of Netflix May 15, 2017 12:35 pm EDT By Kate Cox@kcoxdc rooting it out drm netflix android apps Folks who enjoy tinkering with their Android phones have gotten a rude surprise this week: As far as Netflix is concerned, their phones no longer exist, and can no longer install or update the streaming video app. Android news site Android Police reported Saturday that writers for the site were suddenly unable to see or download the Netflix app from the Google Play store. The problem seemed confined solely to rooted and unlocked devices. One of the reasons people sometimes buy Android phones is because of how comparatively easy it is to “root” them — do an end-run around the version of Android the manufacturer (Samsung, LG, etc) has installed, giving themselves access to the full suite of Android functions. This shouldn’t, in and of itself, cause any problem with most Android apps. And indeed, the Netflix app is still working as usual if you’ve already got it on your phone. If you don’t already have it on your phone, though, good luck getting it — your official channel has just closed. If you’re browsing the Google Play store from a rooted device, Netflix now shows up as “incompatible with this device.” This is intentional, Netflix told Android Police: “With our latest 5.0 release, we now fully rely on the Widevine DRM provided by Google; therefore, many devices that are not Google-certified or have been altered will no longer work with our latest app and those users will no longer see the Netflix app in the Play Store.” Turning this back into English, it seems our old friend DRM — digital content locking — is the core of the problem. Widevine is a DRM tool made by Google. The Netflix app now uses it to make sure you’re not stealing and sharing video from their service, but unlocked phones are showing up as incompatible with it because of the way the Google Play store checks. While the app is still working on phones that already have it, losing the listing from the Google Play store now makes it significantly more difficult for phone owners to download security or feature updates for the app as they’re rolled out. And that, in turn, makes those phones not only less functional, but less safe.

But there's one threat: Amazon's eventual dominance of retail. That's what Elevation Partners Co-Founder Roger McNamee told CNBC on Monday. "Eventually they're going to be such a large percentage of the retail business that when Facebook and Google are going to try to sell ads the only guy on the other side is going to be Amazon," said McNamee. He added, "If you're wondering what the limit function is on Google's model or on Facebook's model it's Amazon getting a large enough share of retail to be able to say, you know I like that price but I'm gonna put two zeros in before the integer value, and cut the price by 99%," he said. "They will have that power eventually." McNamee says Amazon's potential dominance in the retail sector is only one part of the equation, the other arguably more important part, he says is the company's data. "Amazon is hosting all of the best applications, they have all the best intelligence that everybody wants," said McNamee. "How long would it take them to go from zero to number one in e-mail, for example? How long would it take them if they decided to make security a really, really, really important element of what they're doing?" he said.

It may be announced as soon as this week at Google’s I/O developer conference. Assistant is reportedly going to be launched as a standalone app for iOS. Details are slim at this point in time but if an announcement is due soon, there’s not going to be a better stage than I/O 2017 for Google to make it. AndroidPolice hears from a trusted source that Google Assistant launch for iOS may take place as soon as this week. It will be launched as a standalone app for Apple’s mobile platform. The app is reportedly going to offer a mix of the chat style features in the Google Allo version of Assistant and the voice-enabled version found on Android. This isn’t confirmed, though, so the final implementation could end up being different. The report also mentions that the Google Assistant for iOS launch is only going to be limited to the United States initially. It remains to be seen how long the company will take to expand it to other markets across the globe. Google should make the announcement at I/O 2017 if one really is due.

To be clear, these aren’t one of the 300 Android Auto compatible car models that have launched since 2014. These new infotainment systems have stand alone Android built-in which will allow your car to do things like run your favorite apps & services, and control vehicle functions like air conditioning, sunroof, windows, and more from Android on your dashboard. As you might expect, you’ll also be able to find the nearest restaurant with Google Maps, EV charger with Plugshare, listen to Spotify or NPR (or Google Play Music?!), or ask Google Assistant for help—even when you leave your phone or tablet behind. We had a brief look at the Android Car back at I/O 2016 (below) complete with its Tesla-like display, but today Google is announcing that systems based on Android are coming to market from both Volvo and Audi. As you can see from the gallery below, this isn’t just Android ported to a car display. It appears that Google has made an entirely new UI for the car. Interior Immediately, a couple of things come to mind: Will these infotainment systems be properly firewalled off from the drive systems so that Android malware/attacks aren’t allowed to take over your vehicle? Will Apple fans boycott these cars because of the built-in Android systems? An interesting detail that Google’s vice president of engineering for Android, Patrick Brady told Bloomberg was “that Apple’s CarPlay could run on top of cars with the embedded Android system.” Even if it’s technically possible, it may be unlikely for Apple to agree to implement CarPlay into Android based vehicles. Google won’t be receiving any revenue from car manufacturers as they bring Android to their infotainment systems, but it will allow the company to expand Google Assistant and stay a step ahead of Apple and Amazon in the vehicle industry for the time being. We’ll be on hand at Google I/O starting tomorrow night (covering car stuff with sister site Electrek), so stay tuned for the coverage. The session will be at Google I/O Wednesday and called Assisting the Driver: From Android Phones to Android Cars. You can reserve your seat here or watch the livestream at home.  Wed. May 17, 2PM – 3PM Stage 1 Content level: Intermediate Cars are rapidly transforming into connected, intelligent machines and provide a new opportunity for enabling a rich app ecosystem. However, cars still represent a challenging environment: driver distraction, varying screen sizes & shapes, different input mechanisms, local regulations, and much more. Android Auto enables developers to deliver seamless experiences that reach millions of drivers through the ever-increasing number of Android Auto compatible cars and the new standalone phone app. We’ve made great progress so far, but this is just the beginning for Android in cars with a lot more on the road ahead. In this session we’ll talk about recent developments, and an exciting preview of what’s ahead, as we integrate Android, the ecosystem, and the Google Assistant more deeply into cars. Press releases from Audi and Volvo Follow: Audi shows integrated Android operating system in Audi Q8 sport concept ● New, open system architecture for in-car infotainment ● Audi presents the Audi Q8 sport concept technology platform with a fully integrated HMI solution featuring Android at Google I/O developer conference ● The bundled know-how of the community can speed up the development of future in-car apps Ingolstadt/Mountain View, May 15, 2017 – 7,000 attendees on site, millions worldwide via the internet: Audi is taking part in the renowned Google I/O developer conference, where it is presenting its concept of a next generation infotainment system with fully integrated Android. This world premiere opens up new perspectives, which will allow the development of connectivity services to be greatly accelerated. The three-day Google I/O, which begins May 17 at Google’s headquarters in Mountain View, California, is considered as the largest and most important developer conference in the software industry worldwide. One of the exhibits features Android as a seamlessly integrated solution for in-car infotainment applications, which is being developed by the Android Open Source Community and its millions of members. The Audi Q8 sport concept technology platform, which Audi is presenting at Google I/O, already has Android on board. The new functions, including the streaming service Spotify, Google Play Music and Google Assistant all run on the large MMI touch display in the center of the dashboard. The information is also visible in the Audi virtual cockpit in the driver’s direct field of view. This marks the first time the new services have been fully integrated into Audi’s brandspecific infotainment system. While the navigation map continues to use the Audi-typical HERE database, the driver can also choose to navigate with Google Maps. A message center for incoming messages and calls round out the new services in the show car. The seamless integration of Android harbors tremendous potential. Android is the world’s most popular mobile platform with more than 1.4 billion active users worldwide. The open Android community’s immense breadth of expertise and creativity can speed up the development of new applications. New apps can quickly find their way into the cars as additional connected services, for example, if they fulfill the requirements of Google and Audi. The foundation for this is the Android platform. Other customer advantages alongside shorter update cycles include a significantly greater diversity of services as well as broad international availability. When people are able to pursue any activity they want in the car of the future, the integrated Android system will enable them to use the entire world of Smartphone apps in the car.   Volvo Cars partners with Google to build Android into next generation connected cars Volvo Cars, the premium carmaker, has announced a close partnership with Google, one of the world’s largest technology companies, to develop the next generation of its award-winning in-car infotainment and connectivity solution based on Android, offering access to a wide array of apps and services. It will launch on new Volvo models within two years. The partnership promises to revolutionise how Volvo customers engage and interact with their cars. The large catalogue of popular Android apps – developed by Google, Volvo, or third party app developers – will offer connected and predictive services in and around the car. “We are making an important strategic step with the Google partnership. Google’s platform and services will enhance the user experience by enabling more personalisation possibilities, while Android will offer increased flexibility from a development perspective,” said Henrik Green, Senior Vice President Research &amp; Development at Volvo Car Group. Volvo Cars’ partnership with Google reflects the ongoing convergence between the automotive and technology industries as cars become increasingly connected. Volvo believes smart partnerships are the future for the car industry. Using Android as the base operating system will increase speed and flexibility in the development and offer its customers the ability to personalize the connected in-car experience. “We’re thrilled to partner with Volvo to bring Android into their next generation connected cars,” said Patrick Brady, Vice President of Android Engineering at Google. “This partnership gives us the opportunity to deliver a more seamless experience to Volvo drivers through a full-featured infotainment platform and rich ecosystem of Android applications and Google services.” “With the advent of Android we will embrace a rich ecosystem while keeping our iconic Volvo user interface. We will offer hundreds of popular apps and the best integrated experience in this broad, connected environment,” said Henrik Green. Volvo is also collaborating with Google on another initiative to update recent Volvo models by adding Google Local Search, a location based service application. This will be released through an update to customers with Sensus Navigation. Further details on the partnership and Android OS will be announced at Google’s annual tech show, Google I/O on May 17.
