Under the terms, Snap is required to spend at least US$400mil (RM1.77bil) a year on Google cloud services. A portion of these payments can be delayed, during the first four years of the deal. In return for this commitment, Snap said it will get discounted pricing from Google, without being more specific.  The deal is a big win for Google’s cloud division, which under Diane Greene, is trying to catch leaders Amazon.com Inc and Microsoft Corp. Snap was an early customers of Google’s cloud services, and the social media company remains one of its largest spenders, people familiar with the companies have said. — Bloomberg Tags / Keywords: Foreign News , Corporate News , Technology You May Be Interested New York sues Charter, alleges Time Warner fraud on Internet speeds Indian IT firms to meet Trump officials on visa reform concerns Snap signed five-year, US$2bil deal to use Google’s Cloud Here’s Apple’s challenge in India Facebook, Microsoft said to circulate immigration open letter Is it time to say ‘goodbye’ to Google Allo?

The BRC-Google Online Retail Monitor for the fourth quarter of 2016 found that the volume of overseas customers making online searches for UK retail brands was up by 23% across all devices in the fourth quarter of 2016, compared to the same time in the previous year. Search volumes on mobile devices were up by 16%. Martijn Bertisen, retail director at Google [IRDX VGOO], said: “Overseas interest in UK brands was up 23% in the last quarter of 2016. Foreign exchange rates have continued to position UK brands favourably internationally, with particularly strong growth from our European neighbours. “Slowing tablet sales has meant that increased demand is largely coming from smartphones, with triple digit growth observed in some regions. In this mobile-first world, having a great user experience is crucial for our retailers. A recent Google study found that only five of the top 20 UK retailers’ mobile sites load in less than two seconds.” The most popular categories that overseas shoppers looked for via mobile were apparel (+64%) and beauty (+50%). The strongest interest came from Croatia (+106%). At home, said Bertisen, searches were directed towards consumer electronics across all categories. “Driven by Black Friday and Christmas deals, UK consumers still demand the latest product releases and tech gadgets,” he said. Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium [IRDX VBRC], said: “Digital continued to play a pivotal role in driving sales for UK retailers in the final quarter of 2016. In December, the online penetration rate for non-food remained above 20 per cent for the fifteenth consecutive month and the channel won its greatest share of Black Friday and Christmas sales to date. It is no surprise therefore that today’s figures, which show high double digit growth of mobile search volumes across most UK brand categories, are consistent with this trend. “At home, the top trending searches reveal that seasonal occasions and events prompted the highest volumes of browsing activity. Meanwhile, the attention of overseas consumers was drawn to the apparel and beauty brands which demonstrated the strongest growth in category searches on a mobile device, with an impressive 64 per cent and 50 per cent increase respectively. “This quarter’s figures provide further evidence that the EU is an increasingly important market for UK retailers and that consumers from the continent are increasingly likely to be experiencing the British retail offer through their smartphones. The challenges and opportunity for UK retailers to capitalise on this rapid growth persist and British businesses remain focussed on tailoring their ecommerce offer to utilise the strength and popularity of UK retail beyond our own borders, which shows little sign of diminishing.” Mentioned in this piece… Google IRDX: VGOO Google is an American multinational corporation specialising in Internet-related services and products.

Sign up now Menu ARN Snap is paying Google $400M a year for cloud services Snap is paying Google $400M a year for cloud services Snap has agreed to a minimum annual cloud bill roughly equal to its 2016 revenue Blair Hanley Frank (IDG News Service) 03 February, 2017 16:16 - - - - print email Comments Over the next five years, the company behind Snapchat will pay Google at least US$2 billion in cloud bills. On Thursday, Snap revealed in a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission that it signed a five-year contract to pay Google at least $400 million a year for cloud services. That's a steep figure, considering that Snap made roughly $404 million last year.  In return for the massive commitment, Snap will receive reduced pricing, though it’s not clear how deep the company’s discounts will be. Sinking a bunch of money into Google Cloud makes sense, because Snapchat began its life built on top of Google’s AppEngine platform-as-a-service offering. Furthermore, Snap’s commitment to Google is a massive vote of confidence in the latter’s cloud capabilities, at a time when there’s heavy competition in the cloud market. Right now, Google’s cloud is an underdog compared to Microsoft and Amazon. But being tied to a rising star in the social media landscape like Snapchat could help draw other companies to at least give Google’s platform a chance. However, the contract is not without risk. If Snap doesn’t use $400 million worth of Google Cloud services in a year, it’s still on the hook for the full value of the contract. What’s more, the company said in the filing that it uses Google for the “vast majority” of its “computing, storage, bandwidth, and other services.” If something goes wrong with Google Cloud, or if the tech titan gets out of the public cloud business, it could be bad news for Snap. That last scenario seems highly unlikely, considering that Google continues increasing its investment in its cloud platform. Urs Hölzle, Google’s vice president of technical infrastructure, said last year that the company plans to launch new cloud data centers at the rate of roughly one each month this year. All of this is tied to Snap’s plans to pursue an initial public offering in the near future. The filing released on Thursday is one of the company’s steps along that path. Snap’s IPO is being closely observed by the tech industry because of the company’s high-flying status. It remains to be seen how Wall Street will receive the company, especially since it’s far from profitable and its losses have widened year over year. Plus, the deal with Google means that Snap will be saddled with hundreds of millions of dollars in liabilities for the foreseeable future.

According to Brand Finance’s Global 500 2017 report, Google’s brand value surged as much as 24 percent last year to $109.4 billion. Cupertino-based Apple’s brand value, however, fell 27 percent to $107.1 billion, and it dropped to the second place. “Google remains largely unchallenged in its core search business, which is the mainstay of its advertising income,” the report said. The Google brand benefitted from the numero uno position it enjoys in the maps space, and its other products—Android, Chrome and YouTube—also retained their individual brand value. However, the report also mentioned that Google is attracting scrutiny over the erosion of personal privacy and potential monopolistic behaviour, and that a mono-branded approach here may not work in its favour. Google had made attempts to move away from this approach in 2015 when it went through corporate restructuring and became a division of new parent Alphabet. Diversifying its brand portfolio helps Alphabet avoid excessive scale and divert regulatory attention, mentioned the report. On the other hand, Apple has “failed to maintain its technological advantage and repeatedly disillusioned its advocates with tweaks when material changes were expected,” the report said. Other top brands Tech brands continued to enjoy superlative brand value, followed by the banking sector, telecommunications, retail and auto. E-commerce firm Amazon was third ($106.4 billion) on the list, followed by telecom company AT&T ($87 billion), which came in fourth. The fifth position was held by Microsoft ($76.3 billion), followed by South Korean electronics giant Samsung, telecom firm Verizon, US-based retailer Walmart and social media company Facebook. Amazon’s brand value grew 53% in 2016 as it continued capturing market share in several geographies. Facebook saw 82% growth in brand value, but Chinese tech brands Alibaba, WeChat and Tencent grew faster at 94%, 103% and 124%, respectively. Like this report?

For more on the Marshmallow leak, take a look at this full rundown from XDA-Developers. It reviews the update’s early performance. For a set of photos, take a look at these Galaxy Note 5 Marshmallow photos. Verizon’s run down of the Marshmallow update will also give you a feel for the changes. In addition to these positive changes, it’s worth nothing that the Galaxy Note 5 Android 6.0.1 update is plagued with issues including battery drain, issues with Gear VR and other smaller bugs. These issues have extended to the Verizon Galaxy Note 5 Android 6.o.1 update. Verizon users are already starting to complain about battery drain, Wi-Fi problems and more. We expect complaints to pick up as the roll out picks up speed. It’s not clear how these problems will impact the overall speed of the roll out (it doesn’t appear to have slowed it down yet) but Galaxy Note 5 users will want to be cautious when Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow arrives. Galaxy Note 4 Marshmallow Update The Samsung Galaxy Note 4 and the Samsung Galaxy Note Edge Marshmallow updates are rolling out right now. Sprint is pushing out its version of the Galaxy Note 4 Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow update right now. The U.S. Cellular Galaxy Note 4 Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow update appears to be rolling out as well.

U.S. Cellular’s also started rolling out the Samsung Galaxy S 10.5 Android Marshmallow update after a long wait. Samsung Galaxy S7 Marshmallow Update As expected, the new Samsung Galaxy S7 and Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge both run the company’s Android 6.0.1 software. The two devices run a unique version of the operating system. You can get a feel for their version of Marshmallow software in the hands-on video above. It’s worth noting that the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge do not support Android 6.0’s Adoptable Storage feature, a concern given the fact that it only comes with 32GB of internal storage space in the United States.

As for the contents of the January patch, Samsung’s latest security update comes with several important patches and you can read the specific patch notes on the company’s website. Android Nougat As we’ve noted, the Samsung Galaxy Marshmallow roll out has been joined by Samsung’s new Android 7.0 Nougat update. The company’s official Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge Android Nougat roll outs have begun though the release is limited to select models in select regions around the world. We expect that to change soon. Samsung’s promised several Nougat updates in the first half of 2017 and we expect all of these upgrades to deliver new features, tweaks and fixes for lingering Marshmallow issues. For more information on the Android Marshmallow’s successor, take a look at our Samsung Galaxy Android Nougat roundup and our Android Nougat walkthrough. Samsung’s Android Nougat update will bump devices from Android 6.0.1 to Android 7.0. It’s not clear when or if Samsung will bump its devices to Android 7.1.1, the most up-t0-date version of Nougat. 10 Things to Do Before Installing Samsung Galaxy Marshmallow Get Familiar with Android 6.0.1 & Marshmallow   1 / 10 Let's start with something very important.  One of the first things you'll want to do is get familiar with the changes coming with your version of Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow. Each update is going to be a little bit different (carriers can't help themselves) but there some core elements to each.  There are a number of resources around the web but we'll provide you with some great starting points right here.  We've taken a deep dive into the differences between Lollipop and Marshmallow and you'll want to check the basics out so that you're comfortable with the changes.  Android 6.0.1, the version of Marshmallow rolling out to Galaxy devices, is a little different than Android 6.0. You can get familiar with some of Android 6.0.1's basics right here. And then we get to the device level. That is to say that the Galaxy S6 Marshmallow update is a little different than the Galaxy Note 5 Marshmallow update. We've outlined some of those differences and you can find them at the links provided.  Things will be different at the carrier level as well and you'll want to look into those changes as well.

The hype and the hype over a few stupid changes is crazy. You guys in the media have to stop making things bigger than what they are, When a MAJOR change occurs, then hype and push it. Marshmallow is not a big deal. 01/12/2016 mnet Reply Marshmallow is hug Ben. It is huge because of the features you will get to control app permissions. The “wild west” days of Android apps with their crazy permissions is coming to an end. If you have not discovered all the features of 6.0 yet its because you have not looked into what is really there but instead troll the web. 01/26/2016 Emma William Reply Samsung starts rolling out January security update for its flagship smartphones including Galaxy S5 04/03/2016 Elijah Abeyta Reply You’re mistaken. This update is about the marshmallow 6.0.1 and you must be talking about marshmallow 6.0 04/18/2016 William Ernst Reply The update sucks if you have an S5, as it has eliminated the feature that lets you transfer applications to the SD card 05/19/2016 Jamario Souza Reply The worst thing after this update is that I simply lost LTE connection. Only acces 3G. With Android 5 I could manage Network Band and select my prefered band, but now I have no access to it. In March it updated to Android 6.0, this month it updated to 6.0.1 and the shit continues. I cannot unlock phone using fingerprint after rebooting phone. It seems to me that Android M has taken a step backwards with my device.

Here’s what I’ve been doing>> USA Jobs Resort 04/14/2016 Robert Reply I disagree. I’ve had my S6 for several months on Lollipop, finally got the update to Marshmallow from Verizon a couple weeks ago and I’m really enjoying it. My S6 has much better battery life and it performs much better in benchmarks and normal use. It’s smoother (not as laggy), apps load faster, messaging is more streamlined (no more waiting to take and send pics through text), and total control of app permissions (finally). Marshmallow is a major update and I couldn’t be happier with it. It’s just a shame it took so long to actually get it. 06/21/2016 laurarussell532 Reply I found a great site that focuses on stay at home mom’s complete guide to gaining a serious amount of money in very little time.

If it’s not resolved within the two year update I’m moving to iOS. I rather deal with a company that updates regular and is more restrictive about what you can have than a company that takes months and months to update their devices. 01/11/2016 Taha Reply Chuck. Buying a nexus gives you instant apple style hardware and software updates. Cheers 01/12/2016 mnet Reply I agree with you to a point. But you have to ask yourself are you looking for updates for the sake of just getting something “new”? Most updates are minor, granted 6.0 is no minor update.

I think that it’s going to be another couple of months before I see it on my Note 4. But some great additions I didn’t expect…they’ve added scrolling screenshot functionality & the Edge is, at last amazing with half screen functionality and loads upon loads of Edge improvements. Battery life seems far better. I haven’t really dug in to fund everything yet, but so far as great improvement.

Samsung needs to stop making dozens of devices with then dozens of variants of the same device! This is why they can’t update in a timely manner. If Google and Apple can make their device line up simple then so can Samsung! If Apple and Google can bypass carriers for updates and send them direct to users then so can Samsung. Until Samsung smartens up, they have lost me as a customer! Next phone will either be a Google Nexus device or (I hate to say and even think it but) iOS. I left Apple for Android but Google hates sd cards, all other manufacturers are slow to update. It’s ridiculous! Also the fact Samsung is removing the “adoptable storage” feature from their Android 6.0.1 updates is ridiculous! It’s a Google feature and Samsung and LG should have no right to remove/disable it. Give us the choice FFS! F U SAMDUNG! 02/25/2016 Too Squat Reply Note 4 owner…I think this is my last Samsung. I bought it because of the pen. Used to be an HTC buyer, they converted me to Android.

This is like reading the same thing over and over and over again. 4 months into Marshmellow and barely any devices have recieved it. Pathetic. Carriers suck with the added bloatware but it shouldn’t be this damn complicated. The real reason for the wait, S7 and S7 Edge. Gotta make sure as many people buy the latest and greatest before taking care of their actual customers first. Yes, its a business but wow…get the ball rolling Samsung or you’ll be losing about 100 people I know who’d love to try Apple.

Sir….. 02/29/2016 ThisGuyEntitledMuch Reply wow 02/29/2016 Charles Reply To the coders, thanks and all that… I’m sure that you busted a gut over this thing. but, Marshmallow doesn’t appear to be worth the risk of bricking your phone. You got Lollipop working ok.. You even dumped out a security patch. It works… It works well… The phone works as advertised. 6.0 and/or 6.0.1 for all the fanfare and hooplah… just doesn’t seem like it’s worth the risk. Maybe after 6.0.1 gets debugged… and/or maybe a 6.0.2 rolls out – or, maybe after the security fixes for it hit the bricks… It’ll be mature to a point where it’ll install and do what it’s supposed to do without doing any harm…. That could be a year away. Hell, there is even super hype blurting out over Android N… – and, they haven’t delivered 6.0.1… Why not talk about O and P while you’re at it…. There are still a lot of un-used letters in the alphabet. There is little or no talk about a USA release… thank god. It has to start out in S. Korea… and work its way west thru Bangladesh and Botswana. Sure, fine… brick pygmy phones if you have to. Don’t release the >1Gb bloat code here – until it works… It doesn’t even have to deliver the BS hype… just don’t brick my phone. and, If at all possible – don’t gut any useful functionality – that I had in Lollipop… We all know BS when we hear it. We know it won’t do all that you say it will do…. In short.. Do no harm… Don’t release an OS that is worse than the one we got. 02/29/2016 Bharath Reply Any chance of Touchwiz update on note 4? 03/01/2016 Young_Android_Runner Reply 29Feb2016 > Marshmallow isn’t here yet but we’re already hearing about a potential successor to the Marshmallow update Huh?

Like, now I cannot define the pattern of vibration when a phone rings. Bummer. I liked that. Second, while waking up the phone, the screen-light come on really slowly. Third, the Settings aren’t all same like Galaxy S7. There is no triple-press home button for one-hand use feature. Fourth, Galaxy Labs is absent. Oh well, can’t think of more at the moment. There are many more, though. Disappointing, Samsung.

Google search for your correct way of entering recovery. Then when you do get there, use volume keys as directionals to select clearing system cache. OK that by the power key.

If you don’t have it and don’t care, you still didn’t need to post. Let us rant and why don’t you stay quiet? Samsuck is notorious for sending out upgrades late, thanks to their crappy touchwhiz garbage. They have to make sure the newest OS is working with that and thus it takes the longest. This is my first and last samsuck device, not only because of late OS updates (and N is right around the corner), but also because of their rapid charging mode. It wears out their batteries and people have to go buy new ones after about a year. My iPhone 5 that I gave my wife, I bought at launch and it is still working flawlessly on the same battery. My samsuck nope 4 is not holding the charge it once did because of its battery issue. I won’t be buying a new battery, however, I will be buying a new phone. And if I have to sell a kidney to afford and iPhone then so be it. 03/22/2016 Mathew Bolles Reply I received my update on my US Cellular S6 two days ago.

From what I can tell…. No one involved in the process seems to know what the process is. Supposedly, it is really rolling out some where… Botswana… Bangladesh… the Punjab in India. It is rolling of obscure tele-cos… with 10s of 100s of customers… The smaller the better. No projected or predicted or implied delivery dates have been met – any where. Those that got it – and, it worked – don’t seem to have a problem with it… even if it comes with its own completely new set of anomalies. Those that got it and it bricked their devices… simply disappear into non-digital existence. There seems to be some people that may or may not have it… that just love it to death. They are others seeing it as a cure for imagined ills. Then their are a few walking wounded that actually did get it… And, it didn’t deliver as promised. Bottom Line…. So far, it’s a huge non-event… and, that may be the good news… Some devices are skipping this promised land – for the next new – not quite there – version N. Which one must assume will be as nebulous as the nearly existent Marshmallow. This would all be a horrible fate if there was a problem with Lollipop to begin with. Fortunately, Lollipop isn’t all that bad. These promised improvements are like chasing mirages in the dessert… That can be a real problem if you are dying of thirst. The problem for the Android Overlords is that they can’t get any one thirsty for the new products…. Rumors, innuendos, and power of suggestion will only get you – but, so far. Plus, if you deliver one of these half-baked products – and, it bricks millions of devices… that a hell-of-a-lot of negative advertisement to get over. So, the latest update on the update… is that it is still kind of there but not there. No carrier has a completed roll out for all their devices. No device manufacturer has a completed roll out for all their makes and models on all carriers. There isn’t even a single device that is up and running on all carriers. It’s just one very specific make, model, – possibly even a specific block of serial numbers – within a model… pops up with a roll out on – one very specific carrier – usually some where outside the US. This is touted as progress…. Where – in comparison – Apple pulls a roll out and gets 80% of their products updated in a month… Still, ya have to admit…. Marshmallow is worth every penny ya paid for it. 03/24/2016 Jeffrey Gohlke Reply US Cellular S6 updated to 6.0.1 today 3-24-16 03/24/2016 Thersathomas Reply 203=1m­­­­­­­­­y neigh­­­­­­­­­bor’s mo­­­­­­­­­m m­­­­­­­­­akes $80 /h­­­­­­­­­r o­­­­­­­­­n th­­­­­­­­­e int­­­­­­­­­ernet .

However the update to 6.0.1 on the note 4 has a few issues so far, after the upgrade all my Bluetooth connections were wiped out and reconnecting is an issue because I have to reboot the phone and restart the headset 1 or 2 times before the phone sees the headset, I also found that one of tge greatest additions in marshmallows has been left out of the update and that is the theme engine, I mean really what sense does it make to leave out one of the best features, please put out an update that adds this feature back.

Sure, no one wants to rush anything… Why risk bricking your phone? The customers didn’t demand this. The customers aren’t really feeling the burn here… Yet, the vaguest reference of a siting in the most obscure of countries and the smallest of carriers – gets absurd pronouncements. It’ll happen when it happens. About the only good thing you can say about it – is – that it’s worth every penny you paid for it. 04/09/2016 sarcasticdave94 Reply Here’s my 2¢. I’m glad my Note 4 got it as it is an update, it looks OK and works. I don’t like that Sammy took away the ability to move apps to the SD card and that I’ve gotta put the password in every time I reboot the phone. Other methods like fingerprint scan won’t work till after it’s fully rebooted via entering the password. I don’t think I’ve got extra emoji or wherever the modified battery saver was. It did come with a generous supply of Sprint/TouchWiz bloat as usual, but maybe a bit lighter by a few percentage points. I’m glad I didn’t pay for it though. And the next device for me will be called Nexus. See what you get for 2¢. :-P 03/30/2016 Wilson Reply After running the new update my S6 now randomly re-starts itself and I would say roughly half the phone calls are going directly to voicemail.

The pundits sell great snake oil…. btw… And, what’s wrong with snake oil – you might say. When was the last time you saw a squeaky snake? oh… well… There is always April – then May – then June…. Maybe some country some where with a sizable telecom – will roll this thing out and get it to work. Buyer be ware… If you got it “on” your new device – don’t panic… it’ll probably work just fine. Upgrading older devices – is always a bit of a crap shoot. If you bought older legacy hardware and update prior to loading your old apps…. that might work ok, too.. Marshmallow isn’t all that evil… It just can’t cope with all the possible combinations of footprints left over from old OS’s and legacy apps. Nothing ever has. Nothing ever will. The glacial roll out is probably a blessing – in that it is sparing you from the infinite new anomalies that you will encounter… The purported enhancements/improvements – may – or, may not – work as advertised. but, At least, you have gotten used to the quirks in your current device. Why suffer the trials and tribulations of different quirks – whilst Beta testing the lasted flavor. I guess that I long for the daze when one could stone false prophets. Back in the good ole daze, if the prophet spoke and got it wrong – they took him out to the gates of the city and stoned him… Not much of a retirement plan… But, it really cut down on people making idiot claims and speculations. 03/31/2016 Charles Reply Verizon has already inflicted/infected the Samsung Galaxy Note 5 users with Marshmallow…. Batteries dying… WiFi croaking… no access to the AppStore… BlueTooth disconnecting…. Who will be the next victim? Will they bless the 6s class? What did they ever do the Verizon… other than subscribe. The good news here – is – that as glacial as Android is with the updates, they aren’t all that essential. The updates sell features that you have never had… you are being told that you want them. Also… it’s great that it’s free… The update is worth every penny that you paid for it. So – not getting something that you don’t need and didn’t ask for – for money that you never paid… isn’t all that bad of a deal… Then Verizon steps in with its non-value added contribution. This slows the process even further. By the time Verizon is finished bloating the code, even more lettered releases appear on the horizon… N, O, P, etc. Which may displace the much exalted M – all together… and, Is that bad? You are still not paying for it. You still didn’t ask for it. You still don’t need it. So, does it ever matter, which version of the next shiny new OS that you aren’t actually getting? The hype seems totally unaffected. These are the same guys that barely got KitKat and Lolipop to stop coughing up blood… and, those two combined only pulled 37% of the market share for Samsung. Marshmallow is languishing at 2.3% – after 4 months. This is almost as much fun to watch as MicroSloth WinWoes rolling out their free WinWoes Tin…. 03/31/2016 Amy Sweet Reply Did the Marshmallow update and I can no longer lock my phone.

Now my autocorrect replaces REAL words that I have spelled CORRECTLY with words it THINKS I meant and makes me look stupid. Someone can text and ask how I am. I reply “I’m good!” And it corrects the word good and changes it to “not” so I wind up sending “I’m not!” It’s beyond agitating!!! And if I turn it off completely, then I’m left with it correcting nothing at all. So now I’ll have to download a less idiotic keyboard to use and eastern space on my note 5 to do so. this is BS.

My update was just short of 1.4 GB. It has improved my Note by making it feel smoother and more intuitive. It seems to also be a bit lighter as in not so bloated, but I’m unable to confirm that as a fact. The only area I’m disappointed, and it’s a great disservice to us owners in my opinion, I no longer can move apps to the SD card. It’s not even accessable, as in moving apps to it, unless I’m missing something. This in my opinion is a real failure by Sammy. It just confirms my previous plan to go Nexus next time around. 04/09/2016 sarcasticdave94 Reply Sorry for my redundancy at the end there. 04/09/2016 sarcasticdave94 Reply OK so there actually IS a way to transfer files from phone memory to a mounted SD card.

Standby… 04/09/2016 sarcasticdave94 Reply This may help some or all who have received Marshmallow and are having issues with the apps not acting right, the Wi-Fi or etc. This is worth trying once. Learn where you do this on your particular phone as I don’t know about all is of them. I do know I did this to my Sammy Note 4 on Sprint and it helped with crashing apps after updating. Clear all cache. Then reboot. See if it helps. Hint: some devices have a setting menu for this, others you shut off the phone then get to the restore screen to clear cache. Afterwards in either, do a reboot if possible. 04/09/2016 Landon R Caviness Reply Come on AT&T… By far the slowest carrier for updates… 04/10/2016 Ehsan Reply I am overall pleased with the marshmallow update in note 5 features are great interface just goto better, the only thing annoying to me is the grey strip on the top notification panel where battery indicator time etc are located.

Size: 1474.19 MB Version: N915PVPU4DPD1/N915PSPT4DPD1/N915PVPU4DPD1 · OS upgrade – Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow · To get the best from your device, please keep your phone up to date and regularly check for software updates. ※ Fingerprints are securely protected. An alternative unlock method (pattern, PIN, or password) is required to add fingerprints. ※ Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow does not support the Decrypt device function.

Go to Galaxy Apps or Play Store to update apps. 04/21/2016 Charles Reply Marshmallow… 6.0.1 – over hyped… bloated… non-plused…. overall = not bad. For a Samsung Galaxy s6 edge+ / with Verizon, it’s not all that bad. My phone did not brick. My phone is not coughing up blood. The battery does not die… though – I’m not quite sure that the super enhanced improvement is there… The battery is doing ok.. not noticeably worse. The graphic depiction of projected duration is longer… I haven’t tried running it out to 12 hours yet… I don’t run enough BlueTooth peripherals to show a problem… It says its still there… I’m taking it at its word. The WiFi… may have had a problem – or, not…. The home WiFi didn’t skip a beat. The historical archive of pre-existing connections did ok, too… Scanning for potential – new – WiFis could be a problem – or, not… it could just work differently. I’ve had to re-register on a couple of hubs… So far, no big deal. The phone does not get mysteriously hot… or, cold… It does not randomly buzz, vibrate, reboot – or, speak in tongues. All the apps seem to have made it. The app store(s) are still there… — there is a special permission for non-PlayStore apps… Click a button and the Amazon apps, etc… are good to go. The GPS is doing ok. It appears to be doing every bit as well as the old Lollipop… It may be a schoosh faster – snappier. Schoosh…is a technical digital device term = barely noticeable. The user interface “is” slightly different… enough to annoy… I can’t see much of a wow factor in it. The “edge” feature is different… (? better ?)… It’s only better if you were a heavy user to begin with. If you had never bonded to the feature to begin with.. this probably isn’t going to get you anymore involved. So far, Marshmallow is a benevolent improvement. It has done no noticeable harm. I haven’t lost any capabilities. It may even be an improvement – overall. I can’t dodge the feeling that I am missing something… with all the fanfare, there should be some sort of wow-factor that justifies all the hype… Sometimes ya just have to take it as it is… at least, it didn’t set me back. I would recommend it – if I only knew – why? 04/21/2016 Elle Reply Thank you 04/22/2016 Lisa Miceli Reply UGH…not a fan of the update at all.

Like the notifications are gone, developer options says “it doesn’t work for this user”, multitasking app doesn’t work, home and back button is the only one the works. Please help. 05/02/2016 Charles Reply Marshmallow 6.0.1 doesn’t seem to be all that bad…. Eventually, it automatically downloaded, then the annoying window was there for about a week every time you unlocked the screen. I finally consented for it to install… (Verizon Samsung Galaxy s6 edge plus) It blinked and buzzed… blinked some more.. went dark… for awhile… lit back up… did some more blinking… buzzed…. – after a bit, it looked like it was gunna actually do sumthun… The start screen lit up and it jingled its jangle… Then there was much flashing and an occasional buzz…. Once it finished convulsing, I went for a shut down, which it did. After a few moments of calm, I started it back up again. This time it started with less fan fare… about as quickly as Lollipop… It still wanted to do some tweaking… So, for the first half hour or so – it was clunky. Whatever the upgrade is – it takes time to digest. Over the following week or so… mileage has varied. Nothing bad… = but, no wow factor either. The battery usage is some where between psychotic and bewildering. Sometimes it predicts 8 hours… sometimes 3 days. There are weird slopes in the discharge curve, which effect the battery life prognostications. It may depend on signal strength, whether or not WiFi is enabled… and/or the strength of the WiFi signal.. It may also be effected by back ground app updates and the relative signal strengths during those processes.. and, There may be god knows what going on with apps optimizations. I have not let this thing go for 3 days and attained the promised duration… Before I could get 8hr, 12hrs… maybe 16 hrs… before an auto shut down. The best to date with marshmallow – I’ve gotten down to around 30 – 40% in power savings mode in about 22 hrs…. which is an improvement. I just don’t know if I can believe it. The digital services seem to be a bit snappier, quicker. No big difference with calls, gps, bluetooth, or WiFi… The searching and notifications of “new” WiFi signals may be different – but, the devices seems to connect to the old connections – ok. Basically, It hasn’t screwed much of anything up…. I have a very undemanding regimen for the device. What I had it doing – it still does, which is all I asked for. The new “can’t live without features” – eh… just not all that into them, yet. They aren’t bad… I bought the edge plus for the bigger screen – not so much for the edge technology. There’s nothing wrong with it… just wasn’t a big deal to begin with. With all the tapping, dragging, swiping, pinching, spreading… another way of doing the same stuff just adds another layer of confusion to the process… Still, the edge stuff works… The edge bar is bigger.. If I used it, it would be helpful. I can definitely say, that it was worth every penny I paid for it. It has done no damage. No data lost. No performance lost. No functionality lost. The learning curve for the new features is negligible. This positions the device to take advantage of new features in my existing apps. So far – so good…. It may be a benefit for battery usage and charging It will probably be better on my Samsung Galaxy Tab s2… 05/02/2016 Dustin Hall Reply My S6 updated to Marshmallow this morning and I’m getting all these errors: messaging app totally not working, laggy overload for every app, not recognizing my thumbprint, battery draining exceptionally fast.

They are providing no details to their users and it is causing an uproar on their forums with no official notice.

I bought the Galxaxy S6 just to I could use VR Gear .Other than VR, I don’t see any practical iuse for it. Even the most basic things (like finding the IMEI were difficult) and it doesn’t seem to flow s fluid as iPnone does. No iCloud, no iTunes, no FaceTime, no seamless integration with Mac. I will say this: I love being able to add extra stprage to the Android, and though Google Maps and YouTube works great on the Android, gut not on the iPhone. It’s almost as if they crippled the Google apps on iPhone to make it seem lie iPhones sucks.

Try powering off the phone, then boot to recovery mode (hold the home button, the volume up button, and power at the same time) when recovery mode appears, select “wipe cache partition” then reboot. Hope that helps, if not, go back to recovery and do a factory reset. 05/08/2016 Andy Tan Reply just want to know that when can get the update for malaysia ? and in malaysia , S5 will get 6.0 or 6.0.1.. thx 06/03/2016 Ed Reply You’re better off without the update.

I like to keep my phone on silent 24/7 so I don’t bother others, so before I updated it, it had a solid long vibrate and was able to feel it to let me know I got a message but now it’s just 2 really fast buzzes that I can barely feel….it tells me I can set the vibration to the pattern I want but it’s still the 2 quick buzzes….can anyone help me or has anyone had the same problem happen to them??? 05/10/2016 Zachary Munden Reply I wanted to tell everyone that U.S. Cellular has sent out the 6.0 update! 05/11/2016 Brian Reply I wanted to pass this along to owners of the Galaxy Note 4 SM-N910AZKEATT. I am an AT&T customer and like many of you I have been awaiting the Galaxy Note 4 Marshmallow update, but I have been waiting for it for very different reasons. Some owners of the phone may be waiting for it for the same reasons as well. Here is the problem:   Since the internet released that AT&T rolled out the Galaxy Note 4 Marshmallow update overseas, Google App vendors have been upgrading their softwares for the Note in anticipation of the Marshmallow Platform Update. If you are like me and you have been paying attention, these Google Play Apps update sometime 1 to 5 times weekly. With the updates being installed, the phone begins to freeze in certain applications. The phone may allow you close out the application so you may relaunch it, but in my instance this also means removing the battery cover (waiting for a time) and restarting the device. The reason I have now been told 5 times by AT&T tech reps is that the phone has not been updated with the software needed to support the updated Apps. So basically, between 1 to 6 times daily my device freezes.   Now, when I became upset about this was when I was told to upgrade to a new device, instead of being told when the Marshmallow Update would be released. Basically, my device is acting like it has a virus but is actually working as intended but is having a problem with software in Apps versus Platform issue. This meant I was being told upgrade a perfectly good working phone when there was nothing actually wrong with it. I got to thinking about how many AT&T customers are being told this, who may not be asking the right questions and I became even angrier, as they are throwing money at the company for a problem that is easily fixed:   1.       Either they indicate the Galaxy Note 4 is not going to be upgraded in the US, which causes vendors to stop notifying your phone to upgrade Apps. 2.       Or, they upgrade the phone to Marshmallow Software in the US post haste.   Basically I am outlining a very poor customer service issue. This is either due to AT&T’s negligence, Samsung’s negligence, or Googles. When you call to speak with anyone about this, they point the finger elsewhere as the problem. Warranty sent me a refurbished device to see if it will work better for me. It is on its way. I doubt it will, because of the issues I have been having. I thought I would pass this along to encourage all with a Galaxy Note 4 to call AT&T if you have been told to upgrade your device unnecessarily.   I upgrade, normally to a new phone 1x a year. As a present to myself on my birthday. This is the first time I did not upgrade as I was not happy with the lack of expandable memory in the Note 5. So I kept the phone. So now almost 2 years later, I am having all of these problems with a perfectly good phone and due to lack of SOFTWARE SUPPORT.  I hope me explaining this issues helps address your problem if you are having the same issue yourself. I encourage you to complain. Perhaps this will induce them to release the software, or finally release that they have no intention of doing so. Which also fixes the problem. 05/16/2016 Eric Johnson Reply Very nicely said. You brought out all the problems I was having. After I read your very long message, I was really with on most points. My final thought was I’m going to have to complain and complain. So like you said, complain about these issues were having. Maybe, just maybe that will work. Let’s hope that works. 05/11/2016 Shanna Hall Reply My Galaxy S6 Says That It Is Up to date But My Phone Is Still On lollipop. I haven’t even gotten the option to get marshmallow yet. I have at&t by the way. 05/13/2016 George Reply Why does this site keep showing it’s been updated with new information and staying at the top of the search engine list. Is it because of people leaving comments? It’s pretty dumb if that’s the case. There is nothing new here to read about, it’s the same info over and over again as well as people saying they got the update or complaining that android sucks and the marshmallow update ruined their phone 05/16/2016 Mike Reply Look at the date of the post. I searched it today (the 16th of May) and it says it was updated…today. I bet if I come back tomorrow and refresh it will say it was updated on the 17th.

Google customers are already running Android 7.0 while the rest of use wait for 6.0.1 which really offers no great new features unlike N which has inline replies split screen for multi tasking, night and day modes and hundreds of new features Samsung won’t ever get. Most Samsung’s still run lollipop, while I run the new modern OS Android 7 which came via an OTA as soon as I got my lg nexus which runs pure Android not some dodgy rip off touch wiz crap. Samsung’s owners are some of the last to ever get updates even smaller brands already have marshmallow out of the box. I also get updates before any other brand for the life of the phone not for a limited time like none Google branded phones. I like to get my updates fast not years after its release. 05/17/2016 Brodie Yg Reply And I can’t believe how people think it’s hard to find an imei number in Android it’s a 5 digut dialler code *#06# it’s that simple unlike Apple were you have to go through multiple screen to get such information. 05/17/2016 TBen Reply Te reason why most people buy Samsung phones and not Nexus is because Nexus is just a piece of crap.

The battery blather… – all the hype about improved battery performance – is a bit weird. The prognostications as to when it will die are all over the place. Sometimes it thinks that it can run for daze on the existing charge… sometimes just 6 to 8 hours… It “does” seem to re-charge faster. It doesn’t seem to be overheated when it does so. So far, it has been benevolently benign…. No lost data… No lock ups. It still works about like it did with Lolipop… I have noticed an occasional re-boot, on its own.. No boot loops. Some apps are a bit snappier and faster… some aren’t… some are the same. It could just be the calm before the storm… The chargers, the cables, the device hardware and OS have come into temporary alignment. We all know that it won’t last…. Sooner or later 5G will drop… = new hardware, new chargers and new cables… the OS will be gawd knows what by then.

Mashmallow,go get toasted. You have caused my phone to overheat, slow its connection to almost anything, freeze so I can’t see my unlock pattern with the keyboard constantly coming up on my Homecreen. Finally the best bit, I always clean out old apps and crap to stop security issues and the CPU slowing down, and I no tech geek. So I should get more than five hours out of a battery charge, when all I doing is leaving it switched on? Samsung – Happy for you to send me a new phone. Otherwise I have no choice but to revive my old Galaxy 4. Kinda sux after paying it off over 12 months. 08/12/2016 Shereen Reply I did my update on Galaxy A5 and love the look. I just have a few concerns, I have checked all my settings and I don’t have restricted data active and my whatsapp come through only when I am in wifi or when I go into whatsapp. This wasn’t like this before I did the update. Not sure what went wrong. I also noticed that when I go into my gallery it hangs before showing me the folders so I can view my photos. 08/13/2016 Mrticklesz Reply Its because they’re trying to sell their new products which is no any different than the note 4.. damn you samsung! 08/14/2016 Dee Reply Still no marshmallow for Galaxy Alpha… 08/18/2016 Dwan Sadler Reply Why didn’t the Sprin’ts Marshmallow update come with video calling? ATT, Verizon, and T-Mobile all have Samsung video calling S M H 08/23/2016 fux Reply Galaxy Alpha – waiting is the hardest time! 08/23/2016 Charles Reply ??? Lollipop worked ??? Marshmallow worked. The security patch worked… Worked = didn’t brick the phone. Differences in performance = negligible. Additional features almost unnoticeable. Improvements = possibly… then again – maybe not. At least, this stuff does no harm… and, It’s worth every penny ya paid for it…. Will the next security fix – really – fix anything… It won’t matter. The guys out there hacking code are so far ahead of the security patches – that they aren’t loosing sleep over the security patches. The security patches only patch found leaks anyway. Will Nougat fix the security issues… = probably not… but, it will make life difficult enough on the device owners to make them think that security has improved.. The hackers are way ahead of the process. They’ll have Nougat leaking while it’s still in beta. So.. we will get yet another candy flavor – this year… That will fulfill our un-expressed desires… They’ll add stuff that we didn’t ask for, telling us that we can’t live without it. They’ll sell it as a security necessity, whilst working on all the dozens of known security compromises. And, roll out a bug fix / security patch weeks after they drop the barely out of beta Nougat. All this does not matter to me. I’m in this for the damn phone. So long as I can make calls / receive calls – I’am ok with all the update/patch bull$hit… Just don’t brick the phone. 08/25/2016 sadsds Reply who can tell me when malaysia will get marshmallow update for galaxy a8(-a800f)? 08/26/2016 Ray Reply I just got the Marshmallow update for my AT&T S5 today.

I also just received the update for the Galaxy Tab S 8.4 tablet. I’m glad they supported this tablet but they clearly did as minimal work as possible. There’s almost no visible change whatsoever. No change in notifications or app drawer at all. Some very slight changes in the Settings menu and that’s about it. I am eager to try bonding the SD card with the main storage memory though as the 16 GB tablets have never cut it. 09/12/2016 MarshmallowForcedFacortyReset Reply I was woken up this morning around 1:30 to my phone making the tmobile sound. I get up and it said the update failed, I selected to have it try again and it forced a factory reset on my phone. All my contacts and out of my 200+ contacts I have 11 now. None of my bookmarks for internet browsers are there. I can’t seriously be the only one. I have a Samsung J7, model number SM-7J00T, and I’m in Washington State. Even things some of the things I had saved on my SD card got wiped. So you can imagine I’m beyond many colorful expressions, especially with the line of work I’m in and the fact I’m also in school right now.

Home Industry Technology Google might stop Gmail service on your computer: here’s why Google might stop Gmail service on your computer: here’s why Tech giant Google has announced that its Gmail service will stop working on some Chrome browsers by the end of 2017. By: FE Online | Published: February 3, 2017 1:15 PM According to a blog posted by Google, it has informed that Gmail will stop working on 53 or lower version of its Chrome browser. The process of stopping Gmail for working on these versions will start from February 8 itself. Tech giant Google has announced that its Gmail service will stop working on some Chrome browsers by the end of 2017. According to a blog posted by Google, it has informed that Gmail will stop working on 53 or lower version of its Chrome browser. The process of stopping Gmail for working on these versions will start from February 8 itself. This move by Google, essentially means that it’s time for Windows XP and Windows Vista users, to start worrying, as they will not be able to use the emailing feature of Google on their Chrome browser. According to Google, the Chrome browser’s versions lower than 53 are open to security risks, mainly because Microsft had stopped the OS support for Windows XP and Vista. This means that if you are still using Chrome v53 or lower, be ready to likely get affected by attacks. Moreover, there will be no bug fixes or security patches available to you. According to Google, you will be able to continue using the Chrome browser till the end of the year, but it will be in the basic HTML version only. Google wrote on the blog, “Gmail users that are still on Windows XP and Windows Vista are the most likely to be affected because v49 was the last released version which supported those operating systems.” Also read | Beware! A new Gmail scam has tricked even computer experts; here’s how you can avoid losing your password Google said that Gmail users who are still on Chrome browser v53 or below will be flashed a message or banner on their screens. In the blog post, Google said, “Google does not typically announce when we discontinue support for older versions of Chrome browser because of our current supported browser policy, which states that only the most recent versions of Chrome are supported. This announcement was made given the expected impact on Windows XP and Windows Vista users and known security risks.” Also read | Now sign into Gmail via Yahoo: Top 5 key features It is important that users should migrate to more secure and supported systems, Google says. If you are still using the Windows XP or Vista OS, you should now upgrade to a new OS. You may also use other browsers to open your Gmail account but it would still leave it highly vulnerable to attacks. Please Wait while comments are loading...

Google makes its security patch available to the OEMs every month with bug fixes and security improvements to the Android build but this time around Sony has definitely surprised the industry with its speed of rolling out the update. The Japanese consumer electronics giant has started rolling out the firmware update, with build number 39.2.A.0.417, for the Xperia XZ and X Performance, which includes Google's February Android security update, Xperia Blog said in its report. Additionally, Xperia X and X Compact have received the February patch as well with their latest update (build 34.2.A.0.311). LG Puts Up January Security Bulletin Before Google Usually it's the Nexus or Pixel smartphones that get the update first due the backing provided by Google but this time around, Sony has made a strong statement by rolling out its update this early in the month. Considering that there have been several vulnerabilities associated with Android that have been exposed by security firms and researchers in last few months, this can be seen as a welcome change from the company. Notably, the search giant earlier fixed the "Dirty COW" vulnerability with its December Android security update. Google has previously encouraged OEMs to push out the security updates in a timely manner in order to keep the devices secure and updated.

Snap's publication on Thursday of its IPO registration document sets the stage for its upcoming marketing campaign to convince investors to look past its widening losses and the firm grip of its founders, and focus on its rapid growth of active users. Also Read: Snapchat files for one of the biggest tech IPOs in years: Report The number of Snap's daily active users grew to an average of 158 million at the end of December, up 48 per cent year-on-year, Snap revealed. However, its net loss widened to $514.6 million in 2016 from $372.9 million the year before. While Snap will have time to polish its marketing pitch in the run-up to the IPO planned for March, some analysts were taken aback that the company was just beginning to reap cash from its product. "What surprises me the most is that it is still very early days when it comes to Snap making money," said Rohit Kulkarni, managing director at private securities investment firm SharesPost. Snap had confidentially registered with the US Securities and Exchange Commission for an IPO late last year. It kept the filing under such tight wraps, even some of its IPO underwriters had not seen it prior to publication on Thursday, sources familiar with the matter previously told Reuters. Snap said in the IPO registration document published on Thursday it would become the first U.S. company to go public with shares on offer not granting voting rights to stock market investors. Its founders, Evan Spiegel and Robert Murphy, will keep control of the company. Snap could be valued at between $20 billion to $25 billion, according to sources familiar with the situation who asked not to be named because the matter is confidential. That would give the company the richest valuation in a U.S. technology IPO since Facebook Inc.Snap, which launched itself in 2012 with an app that sends disappearing messages, rebranded itself last year as a camera company and started selling $130 video camera glasses. It generates the majority of its revenue from advertising, seeking to challenge the dominance of internet giants such as Facebook and Alphabet Inc's Google. "The industry has been crying out for new advertising units" says Ian Schafer, founder and chairman of ad agency Deep Focus, referring to the tight hold Facebook and Google have on the digital advertising marketplace. In its IPO registration document, Snap cited Apple Inc, Google, Twitter Inc, Facebook and its photo-sharing platform Instagram as its competitors. Tight control Spiegel, the 26-year-old Snap co-founder, last year earned $503,205 in salary, with a $1 million bonus. Imran Khan, Snapchat's chief strategy officer whom it hired from investment bank Credit Suisse Group AG in 2014, earned $241,539 last year with a $5.2 million bonus. In 2015, Khan also received $145.3 million worth of Snap shares as a sign-up bonus. Spiegel and Murphy will maintain tight control over Snap's stock through a unique three-share class structure. The structure will give Spiegel and Murphy the right of 10 votes for every share. Existing investors will have one vote for each of their shares, while new investors will have no voting rights. Snap said it couldn't predict if the structure would "result in a lower trading price or greater fluctuations" in the stock. Keeping tight control is common in companies closely associated with their founders, who often prefer to grow their business without being questioned by a broad array of investors. Still, offering a class of stock with no votes in an IPO is unprecedented. Also Read: Snapchat parent selects New York Stock Exchange for IPO Though the structure has drawn some criticism for not giving stock market investors the opportunity to have input, some people close to the company have argued that investors can "vote with their feet" by not buying into the IPO if they are not comfortable with the arrangements. "Investors have to decide, am I going to avail myself of the opportunity to buy the stock, and forget about the fact that somewhere down the road they are likely going to run into trouble?" said James McRitchie, an independent corporate governance activist who has pressed for more equal voting rights at companies including Facebook. Paying Google Snap had $404.5 million in sales in 2016, up from $58.7 million in 2015. However, it had adjusted losses before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization last year of $459 million, compared with $292.9 million in 2015. Snap's biggest losses stem from "hosting fees" which it pays to cloud computing companies such as Google to use their infrastructure for its data. It will pay Google $2 billion over the next five years to use its cloud computing services. Because Snapchat users rely heavily on data-heavy pictures and video, the cost of these service is high. Still, the proportion of the company's costs to its revenue has been declining. Its strategy has been to bargain for better hosting rates as its growing number of users buoys its negotiating leverage.

Facebook's Instagram, which recently introduced disappearing video content similar to Snapchat, had 600 million users as of late last year. Like Snapchat, Instagram sells advertising on its platform.

Snap’s publication on Thursday of its IPO registration document sets the stage for its upcoming marketing campaign to convince investors to look past its widening losses and the firm grip of its founders, and focus on its rapid growth of active users. The number of Snap’s daily active users grew to an average of 158 million at the end of December, up 48 per cent year-on-year, Snap revealed. However, its net loss widened to $514.6m in 2016 from $372.9m the year before. While Snap will have time to polish its marketing pitch in the run-up to the IPO planned for March, some analysts were taken aback that the company was just beginning to reap cash from its product. “What surprises me the most is that it is still very early days when it comes to Snap making money,” said Rohit Kulkarni, managing director at private securities investment firm SharesPost. Snap had confidentially registered with the US Securities and Exchange Commission for an IPO late last year. It kept the filing under such tight wraps, even some of its IPO underwriters had not seen it prior to publication on Thursday, sources familiar with the matter previously told Reuters. Snap said in the IPO registration document published on Thursday it would become the first US company to go public with shares on offer not granting voting rights to stock market investors. Its founders, Evan Spiegel and Robert Murphy, will keep control of the company. Snap could be valued at between $20b to $25b, according to sources familiar with the situation who asked not to be named because the matter is confidential. That would give the company the richest valuation in a US technology IPO since Facebook Inc. Snap, which launched itself in 2012 with an app that sends disappearing messages, rebranded itself last year as a camera company and started selling $130 video camera glasses. It generates the majority of its revenue from advertising, seeking to challenge the dominance of internet giants such as Facebook and Alphabet Inc’s Google. “The industry has been crying out for new advertising units” says Ian Schafer, founder and chairman of ad agency Deep Focus, referring to the tight hold Facebook and Google have on the digital advertising marketplace. In its IPO registration document, Snap cited Apple Inc, Google, Twitter Inc, Facebook and its photo-sharing platform Instagram as its competitors. Tight control Spiegel, the 26-year-old Snap co-founder, last year earned $503, 205 in salary, with a $1m bonus. Imran Khan, Snapchat’s chief strategy officer whom it hired from investment bank Credit Suisse Group AG in 2014, earned $241,539 last year with a $5.2m bonus. In 2015, Khan also received $145.3m worth of Snap shares as a sign-up bonus. Spiegel and Murphy will maintain tight control over Snap’s stock through a unique three-share class structure. The structure will give Spiegel and Murphy the right of 10 votes for every share. Existing investors will have one vote for each of their shares, while new investors will have no voting rights. Snap said it couldn’t predict if the structure would “result in a lower trading price or greater fluctuations” in the stock. Keeping tight control is common in companies closely associated with their founders, who often prefer to grow their business without being questioned by a broad array of investors. Still, offering a class of stock with no votes in an IPO is unprecedented. Though the structure has drawn some criticism for not giving stock market investors the opportunity to have input, some people close to the company have argued that investors can “vote with their feet” by not buying into the IPO if they are not comfortable with the arrangements. “Investors have to decide, am I going to avail myself of the opportunity to buy the stock, and forget about the fact that somewhere down the road they are likely going to run into trouble?” said James McRitchie, an independent corporate governance activist who has pressed for more equal voting rights at companies including Facebook. Paying Google Snap had $404.5m in sales in 2016, up from $58.7m in 2015. However, it had adjusted losses before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization last year of $459m, compared with $292.9m in 2015. Snap’s biggest losses stem from “hosting fees” which it pays to cloud computing companies such as Google to use their infrastructure for its data. It will pay Google $2b over the next five years to use its cloud computing services. Because Snapchat users rely heavily on data-heavy pictures and video, the cost of these service is high. Still, the proportion of the company’s costs to its revenue has been declining. Its strategy has been to bargain for better hosting rates as its growing number of users buoys its negotiating leverage. “They are adding infrastructure ahead of growth, and that is why you have some front-loading of losses,” said SharesPost’s Kulkarni. Some companies such as Facebook have their own hosting platforms, though this model can be more costly.

By Larry Dignan for Between the Lines | January 31, 2017 -- 20:32 GMT (12:32 PST) | Topic: Developer Google said it will move its Chrome for iOS code into the open source community and may have gotten a few digs into Apple while it was at it. special feature Securing Your Mobile Enterprise Mobile devices continue their march toward becoming powerful productivity machines. But they are also major security risks if they aren't managed properly. We look at the latest wisdom and best practices for securing the mobile workforce. Read More In a blog post, Google noted that Chrome iOS "was kept separate from the rest of the Chromium project due to the additional complexity required for the platform." Now Google is moving it into the Chromium project's open source repository. Google noted that to move the code it needed to do "careful refactoring." Specifically, Google said Chrome on iOS had to support WebKit's rendering engine as well as Blink, a engine supported by Chrome for other platforms. TechRepublic: Apple iPhone 7 is being hardened to handle military-grade secrets Google said development speed will be faster for tests of Chrome on iOS. Reading the blog post, I couldn't help but notice that Google mentioned complexity and constraints when referring to Apple iOS. The subtle phrasing obviously is rooted in Google's contention that its Android platform is better for developers. In any case, Google had two variations of the word complex and one mention of constraints in the first 97 words of a blog post.

By: Samden Sherpa Published: Friday, February 3, 2017, 8:00 [IST] Mobile malware is on the rise and your device could be at risk. These tips could help you stay safe and keep your personal information out of the hands of cybercriminals. Well, if you currently analyze the smartphone market then you can see that the adoption rate of mobile devices has skyrocketed and evidently Android is leading the way. The open-source operating system that has been developed by Google is now found on more than half of all smartphones. In fact, according to a report from Strategy Analytics, about nine in 10 smartphones shipped in the latest quarter ran Google's mobile operating system. In addition, Android accounted for a record 87.5% of the 375 million smartphones shipped in the third quarter, ending September 30, 2016. So you can clearly see from the stats that Android continues to dominate the smartphone market. However, because of its popularity and a massive user base, it has now caught the attention of cybercriminals. Currently, Android mobiles are being targeted by virus and malware developers. Moreover, these malware developers are targeting Android mobile devices to accomplish their goals or illegally obtain personal information from Android owners. SEE ALSO: Android 7.1.2 adds swipe for notifications gesture to Nexus 5X and 6P While this is the present scenario in the Android world, with the advancement of mobile technology, mobile malware and viruses are becoming more advanced and thus are infecting millions of mobile worldwide. On the other hand, it is highly recommended that you stick to apps from the official Google Play Store only. If you do you are unlikely to encounter any of the dangerous malware out there. Just to let you know, malware lives and thrives in unofficial app stores, which are largely unregulated. Having said all that, here are the worst malware types you should be aware of and also keep your mobile away. Stay tuned to GizBot for more updates! Ransomware Ransomware is basically a type of malware that encrypts your files and demands a ransom to be paid off to re-gain access back to your files. An example of ransomware would be an app called Simplocker. Simplocker is basically a Trojan malware that disguises itself as an app suitable for adults only. If Simplocker is downloaded and as it enters your smartphone it scans your smartphone's SD card for documents, images and videos. After the scan is complete it encrypts those files using Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). Then it displays a fake FBI message in Russian that accuses the victim of downloading and viewing child pornography on their device. And to get the files back, Simplocker demands some amount to be paid within 24 hrs. It claims that failing to pay the ransom will result in removing all of the files that it has encrypted. However, it has been said that the app doesn't have the functionality to do so. If you are infected with Simplocker, you can download Simplocker Decryptor that was created by ESET. Another type of ransomware which has gained lot notoriety is the "svpeng", which combines ransomware with credit card theft. Svpeng works by presenting a screen to input credit card details every time a user accesses Google Play Store, which then sends the credit card details to the criminal behind this malware. Moreover, once spveng is on your smartphone, it would check to see whether you have a banking app installed. The good news is the Russian police arrested the creator of spveng in April after he stole more than 50 million rubles ($930, 000) and infected more than 350, 000 Android devices. Mobile Shutting Down Android/PowerOffHijack discovered by AVG, is a type of malware that takes control of the process responsible for shutting down your smartphone. With this malware, your phone appears to be off when in fact it's on and functioning. Interestingly, the malware even plays the shutdown animation to show that your device is really turning off. And what this power off hijack really does is it secretly takes pictures, makes calls, and sends messages while you think that your phone is turned off. On the bright side, this type of malware only affects Android versions under 5.0, requires root access and has been found only on apps outside of Google Play Store.

According to experts, "HummingBad" has already attacked more than 10 million Android devices worldwide. Dangerously, this malware has the power to take control of devices; it forces users to click advertisements and download apps by using a multistage attack chain. Moreover, the malware tries to gain access to your device through certain websites and infect it. Once it gets through the device it then tries to gain root access to the device by running software. If it succeeds to get the root access, the attackers will gain full access to your mobile. In case if the malware fails to gain root access, it uses a fake system through which it sends an update notification to your mobile to get system-level permission. Viking Horde This virus can be pretty devastating and harmful for your device. Why we say that is because "Viking Horde" has been created for Google Play Store apps. Through these apps, the virus creates a place in Android devices. Moreover, the virus can infect both rooted and non-rooted devices. So, whenever a user downloads an infected app from Google Play Store, the device gets infected by the malware. The risks of rooted devices are bigger compared to non-rooted devices. In rooted devices, "Viking Horde" installs software and executes code remotely to get access to the mobile data. If it does, then the data of your mobile is at risk. The reason behind launching this app is for conducting ad clicks, spam messages, and others. SEE ALSO: Google Nexus 6 and Nexus 9 will not get Android Nougat 7.1.2 update Phishing Apps While mobile browsing of the internet is growing with smartphone and tablet penetration, fraudsters and cyber criminals are now creating mobile phishing sites that look similar to a legitimate service. And with the existence of such sites these attackers are stealing users' credentials or worse. The fact that mobile devices come with smaller screen is making malicious phishing techniques easier to hide from users. As such it is less sophisticated on mobile devices than PCs. Moreover, phishing schemes use rogue mobile apps, programs which can be considered "trojanized", while hiding their true intent as a system update, marketing offer or game. Some of these malware infect legitimate apps also with malicious code which can be only discovered after installing. Malware Symptoms Having looked at the different types of mobile malware, you might have an idea on how they spread and infect devices. While the do come in various ways, they all can produce similar symptoms. Well, signs of a malware infection can include unwanted behaviors and degradation of device performance. Stability issues such as frozen apps, failure to reboot and difficulty connecting to the network are also common. In addition, mobile malware can drain your battery or processing power, hijack the browser, send unauthorized SMS messages, freeze or spoil the device entirely. SEE ALSO: Google rolls out Android Nougat 7.1.2 Developer Preview for Pixel and Nexus phones How to be Safe? So if you are wondering how you can avoid and be safe from such malware then there are several best practices that all mobile users should follow to prevent Android malware infections. In essence, some malware cases may require special prevention and treatment methods, but following these recommendations will greatly increase a user's protection from a wide range of mobile malware. #1 Download apps only from official app stores like Apple's App Store or Google Play. The vast majority of malicious apps are found on unofficial app stores or websites, many based in China or Russia. #2 Do some research on the developer and their reputation. Read user ratings, paying special attention to reviews from disgruntled users, and seek out app recommendations from reputable sources. #3 Think twice before granting "permissions" when installing new apps for the first time. Often, malicious app developers are counting on that level of carelessness to sneak malware onto your device. Always make sure to carefully read the end user agreement before clicking to understand exactly what permissions the app is asking for. Stay tuned to GizBot for more updates!

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search Nexus 5X gets fingerprint swipe, Nexus 6P might follow JC Torres - Feb 3, 2017 0 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit The Android platform is already notorious for its fragmentation and Google may have contributed to that even further. When it launched its own Google Pixel, it introduced some features that may never reach its other Nexus devices, even if the hardware were capable of supporting it. Google’s tune has changed a bit after much criticism, at least for one particular feature. Fingerprint swipe down, first seen on the Pixel, are coming and, at least according to some reports, has already landed on some Nexus 5X devices. Google has been using a hardware excuse for some of the Pixel features it has decided not to provide other Nexus devices. That, however, has largely been debunked and even Google would later admit that the Nexus 5X, and even the Nexus 6P, have capable fingerprint scanners. It was all a matter of updating firmware and software. Google did say it was doable and would investigate the matter. Apparently, they were able to actually make it happen. That’s happening now with the roll out of the Android 7.1.2 maintenance update to the Nexus 5X. A new “Moves” option appears after installing the update, allowing users to roll down the notification panel by simply swiping down on the fingerprint scanner on the back. What hasn’t happened yet, however, is the same update for the Nexus 6P. It would definitely be painful irony if the more powerful Nexus is left out of this feature, which will surely rouse even more vocal complaints. Chances are, the Nexus 6P will follow suit soon. Hopefully. While it’s indeed good that Google has decided to bring the feature down to the Nexus, its implementation is actually quite limited compared to third-party alternatives. Especially when you have a rooted Nexus phone. Now if only Google would do the same for Night Mode.

Gaming News PS4 Xbox One Nintendo PC Gaming Mobile Gaming What’s Hot Rumour Gameplay Guide Patch Tech News Mobile Tablet Desktop OS Tech Rumors Trending Anime Movies TV Series Entertainment Sports Social Media World News Contact Us The Bitbag Gaming News PS4 Xbox One Nintendo PC Gaming Mobile Gaming What’s Hot Rumors Gameplay Guide Patch Tech News Mobile Tablet Desktop OS Tech Rumors Trending Anime Movies TV Series Entertainment Sports Social Media World News Android Android 7.1.2 Nougat Update: Here Are The Phones Getting First Roll Out By Michael Jay Toledo on February 3 2017 03:53 PM Share Tweet Share Share Email On Monday, Google announced that Android Nougat 7.1.2 is already rolling out to their devices. Although it will only be available on their handsets, it will still be great to know what the inclusions of the update are. Here are the things to expect in Nougat 7.1.2. It can be recalled that back in November, consumers were asking why previous Nexus devices did not receive the “Swipe for notifications” gesture. At that time, Google said they were still “evaluating” the feature. But with the recent update, the feature has arrived on Nexus 5X. It is expected to be on Nexus 6P soon as well. The “swipe for notifications” allow users to swipe across the sensor to bring up their app alerts, instead of doing it on the device’s screen. For 5X users, you can see this under “Moves” in Settings. Aside from 5X, the update has also arrived on Pixel XL and Pixel XL Smartphones. As of writing, update 7.1.2 is only available for Google’s handsets. According to Express UK, Android Nougat 7.1.2 also includes redesigned app shortcuts and better image keyboard support. It has a size of 1.25 GB, so it will be more practical if you are connected to a Wi-Fi network before downloading the update. Details about the update’s arrival on other brands, however, are still not available. Hopefully, mainstream brands will disclose the information soon. Android Nougat 7.1.2 On Other Devices Most consumers know that it was Samsung just recently started launching Nougat 7.0 on their handsets. The update only arrived on Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge last month because the company had to test the software first. The main aim of the test was to fix any bug in the system, if there were any. This was also the case for HTC and Sony. Both companies tested Nougat first before rolling it out to their users. It gave them time as well to add some of their own apps, skins, and services in the system. Unfortunately, Samsung, HTC, and Sony seem to be testing 7.1.2 once more before releasing it. Consumers should expect it to be ready in the next few months. These are the latest news and rumors about Android Nougat 7.1.2 so far. Hopefully, it will arrive on other devices soon so no one will be left out. Share your thoughts in the comments section below.

In the smartphone side of things, the Mountain View company's virtual assistant has been exclusive to the Pixel and Pixel XL, but talks about it going beyond the two aren't anything new, as the LG G6 has already been reported to feature it. Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P Major Update To Expand Google Assistant Devices This news comes from Stephen Hall of 9to5Google, and according to him, he was told about this bit included in the next major update. Was recently told that Assistant is finally coming to Nexus 5X/6P soon with next “major” update. — Stephen Hall (@hallstephenj) February 2, 2017 However, that's about it. There aren't that many details surrounding the topic just yet, but that shouldn't come as much of a surprise considering this is a rumor after all. On an interesting note, Google recently introduced the Android 7.1.2 beta to supported Nexus and Pixel devices, putting the factory images up for download too. This is probably not the major update that comes with Assistant, though, not to mention that it's not available for the Nexus 6P just yet, but who knows. More Devices Expected To Get Google Assistant Other Than Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P Aside from the LG G6, the new Nvidia Shield is also set to support Google Assistant sometime in the future. But what about the Nexus 6 and Nexus 9? Well, it's hard to say since they aren't even getting Android 7.1.2, which Google has already confirmed. For those who can't wait to tinker with Google's virtual assistant, there are already guides (via XDA-Developers) on how to have it up and running on Android 7.0 Nougat or higher devices, but it's not exactly for the faint of heart. Some Google Assistant Features To Look Forward To Back in January, the beta version of the Google App contained clues to some notable features that Assistant could offer, which came to light thanks to some users who dug through the codes. First off, it could have keyboard input and gesture support. Second, it could become capable of letting users make payments with voice commands. To boil things down, the Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P will likely get Google Assistant soon enough, but seeing as this is just a rumor at this point, it's better to take it with the proverbial grain of salt for now. Also, whether or not the major update is referring to Android 7.1.2, 7.1.3, 7.2, or even 8.0 — aka Android O — is unclear. Regardless, this is still a good sign that the AI is about to start making its way to more devices other than the Pixel and Pixel XL. Are you amped-up to have Google Assistant on your phone?

Twitter Facebook Snap is paying Google $400M a year for cloud services Snap has agreed to a minimum annual cloud bill roughly equal to its 2016 revenue Blair Hanley Frank (IDG News Service) 03 February, 2017 16:16 - - - - print email Comments Over the next five years, the company behind Snapchat will pay Google at least US$2 billion in cloud bills. On Thursday, Snap revealed in a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission that it signed a five-year contract to pay Google at least $400 million a year for cloud services. That's a steep figure, considering that Snap made roughly $404 million last year.  In return for the massive commitment, Snap will receive reduced pricing, though it’s not clear how deep the company’s discounts will be. Sinking a bunch of money into Google Cloud makes sense, because Snapchat began its life built on top of Google’s AppEngine platform-as-a-service offering. Furthermore, Snap’s commitment to Google is a massive vote of confidence in the latter’s cloud capabilities, at a time when there’s heavy competition in the cloud market. Right now, Google’s cloud is an underdog compared to Microsoft and Amazon. But being tied to a rising star in the social media landscape like Snapchat could help draw other companies to at least give Google’s platform a chance. However, the contract is not without risk. If Snap doesn’t use $400 million worth of Google Cloud services in a year, it’s still on the hook for the full value of the contract. What’s more, the company said in the filing that it uses Google for the “vast majority” of its “computing, storage, bandwidth, and other services.” If something goes wrong with Google Cloud, or if the tech titan gets out of the public cloud business, it could be bad news for Snap. That last scenario seems highly unlikely, considering that Google continues increasing its investment in its cloud platform. Urs Hölzle, Google’s vice president of technical infrastructure, said last year that the company plans to launch new cloud data centers at the rate of roughly one each month this year. All of this is tied to Snap’s plans to pursue an initial public offering in the near future. The filing released on Thursday is one of the company’s steps along that path. Snap’s IPO is being closely observed by the tech industry because of the company’s high-flying status. It remains to be seen how Wall Street will receive the company, especially since it’s far from profitable and its losses have widened year over year. Plus, the deal with Google means that Snap will be saddled with hundreds of millions of dollars in liabilities for the foreseeable future.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile LG Watch Style With Android Wear 2.0 Leaks In Images, Expected To Retail At $249 By Zara Ali Jan 30, 2017 13Shares Share Tweet Submit With Android Wear 2.0 just around the corner, LG is gearing up to bring in two Android Wear smartwatches. In one of his latest leak, Evan Blass took the wraps off LG’s Watch Style that is expected to ship with Google’s Android Wear 2.0. In the leaked pictures, the Watch Style can be seen in three color variants. In the leak, Evan Blass has just posted the pictures of the Watch Style. However, various rumors about the upcoming wearable suggest that it will feature a 1.2-inch P-OLED display with a resolution of 360 x 360 pixel. It will come with 4GB storage and 512MB of RAM. Also, the smartwatch will be dust and water resistant with the IP67 rating. A 240mAh will power the smartwatch. According to a report by Android Police, LG could price the Watch Style around $249. While LG has not confirmed any info regarding the upcoming smartwatch, but the sources suggest that it will have just one variant available in different colour options. LG had been one of the original partners for Google’s Android Wear program and LG’s G Watch was developed under Google’s guidelines. Advertisement Besides, LG is also working on other smartwatches as well. The other one is Watch Sport, which is rumored to come with better specs than the Watch Style. It is expected to feature a 1.38-inch display with a resolution of 480 x 480 pixel, 736MB of RAM, and IP68 rating. The Watch Sport will come with connectivity options such as LTE, NFC, and GPS. With the upgraded specs, the Watch Sport will most likely be priced higher than the Watch Style, around $100 more. The Watch Sport bears similar specifications as LG’s Watch Urbane second edition that was priced at $359.99 (for AT&T) and $449 (for Verizon). So, we could expect the starting price of the Watch Sport around $350 or more. Apple Garners 104% in Smartphone Profits – Other Android Phone Giants Struggling With Losses Regarding the launch of the new range of smartwatches by LG, Evan Blass tips that the company might unveil them ahead of MWC event, on February 9. Going by the design, the Watch Style and Watch Sport do look a little like Google’s upcoming smartwatches. We will get to see both the smartwatches in their glory when LG makes them official. Stay tuned with us for more info.

Thailand Press Release News search General Business Entertainment IT Stcoks Lifestyle Telecom Energy Properties Automotive Heathcare Events ฝากข่าวประชาสัมพันธ์ Its 2017 And This Is Why Its Time for Your Online Tourism Marketing to Get Real General Press Releases Friday February 3, 2017 13:08 Bangkok--3 Feb--ScottAsia Communications Destinations, hotels and tourism businesses should seize the opportunities of digital democracy created by the semantic search revolution that has only just begun, says Bronwyn White, co-founder of MyTravelResearch.com, which is launching a free webinar series for tourism marketers WHEN Google switched its algorithm to semantic search in 2013 it began to clear away dodgy SEO practices and leveled the playing field for small operators and destinations. It made it easier for small businesses to create an honest strategy to rank well online in Google and the search engines. A few years on, the main outcome is that page one of a Google search will be different for every user, every location and every desktop or mobile device. Today, tourism businesses and destinations therefore have the opportunity to rank well for their ideal customer in Google's organic search results – as long as they commit to building online trust, reputation and authority over time. Relevance and trust are the new currencies in town. They have given travel businesses and destinations opportunities that we are unlikely to see again. It's like being at the beginning of time once more, a time when tourism businesses can not only survive online, but thrive. However, there's no quick fix. If you want to be on the first page of your ideal customer's Google search – as MyTravelResearch.com has done for the terms "travel research" in certain regions – you have to be consistent in your online marketing. This means consistency in branding and content marketing. Post relevant, good quality content and post often. To get results you have to be clear about who your customers are and have a well-defined brand that guides your visual choice and gives you a consistent tone of voice and messaging. The Five Steps Clear branding and customer targeting are the baselines. In addition, there are five steps you have to also take: 1) Make sure you're on Google My Business (it's free). 2) Ensure your site is mobile friendly (you can check here for free – and Google gives you tips how to make your site mobile compatible). 3) Realise that content is king. Create content that is useful, relevant and meaningful. Ensure quality over quantity 4) Make sure your web site and your social media platforms are soundly branded in terms of content, language and image choice. 5) Ramp up the number of images and videos you have on your site (Google loves this). For visual content don't think you need to spend big money on video production. You don't. Videos uploaded from smart phones are often deemed more 'authentic'. For example see "Whale of a Time" or "Who are Roo Looking At?" at http://www.news.com.au/travel/australian-holidays/tourism-australias-favourite-social-media-posts-of-2015/news-story/1ec3b7a4183886142db1cf5e5e474e66. Importantly, to achieve a strong online presence in the brave new world of semantic search all the above elements have to work together. Remember, travel related content is the most watched content on YouTube. In western countries people spend about 13 hours doing online research before making a travel purchase (22 hours in China). People everywhere are perplexed and overwhelmed by the abundance of digital marketing choice. If customers are confused by your brand, search engines will be too. So focus your online branding, messaging and be consistent. Turn the above insights into action and put an end to 'hope marketing'. The full Five-Step Tourism Marketing blog can be read at http://www.mytravelresearch.com/5-step-tourism-marketing-system/. * MyTravelResearch.com will launch free webinars where they teach destination marketing organisations and tourism businesses the methodology to successfully implement the five-step tourism marketing system.

Snap's publication on Thursday of its IPO registration document sets the stage for its upcoming marketing campaign to convince investors to look past its widening losses and the firm grip of its founders, and focus on its rapid growth of active users. The number of Snap's daily active users grew to an average of 158 million at the end of December, up 48 percent year-on-year, Snap revealed. However, its net loss widened to $514.6 million (roughly Rs. 3,467 crores) in 2016 from $372.9 million the year before. While Snap will have time to polish its marketing pitch in the run-up to the IPO planned for March, some analysts were taken aback that the company was just beginning to reap cash from its product. "What surprises me the most is that it is still very early days when it comes to Snap making money," said Rohit Kulkarni, managing director at private securities investment firm SharesPost. Snap had confidentially registered with the US Securities and Exchange Commission for an IPO late last year. It kept the filing under such tight wraps, even some of its IPO underwriters had not seen it prior to publication on Thursday, sources familiar with the matter previously told Reuters. Snap said in the IPO registration document published on Thursday it would become the first US company to go public with shares on offer not granting voting rights to stock market investors. Its founders, Evan Spiegel and Robert Murphy, will keep control of the company. Snap could be valued at between $20 billion to $25 billion (roughly Rs. 1,34,754 crores to Rs. 1,68,441 crores), according to sources familiar with the situation who asked not to be named because the matter is confidential. That would give the company the richest valuation in a US technology IPO since Facebook Inc. Snap, which launched itself in 2012 with an app that sends disappearing messages, rebranded itself last year as a camera company and started selling $130 video camera glasses. It generates the majority of its revenue from advertising, seeking to challenge the dominance of Internet giants such as Facebook and Alphabet Inc's Google. "The industry has been crying out for new advertising units" says Ian Schafer, founder and chairman of ad agency Deep Focus, referring to the tight hold Facebook and Google have on the digital advertising marketplace. In its IPO registration document, Snap cited Apple Inc, Google, Twitter Inc, Facebook and its photo-sharing platform Instagram as its competitors. Tight control Spiegel, the 26-year-old Snap co-founder, last year earned $503,205 in salary, with a $1 million bonus. Imran Khan, Snapchat's chief strategy officer whom it hired from investment bank Credit Suisse Group AG in 2014, earned $241,539 last year with a $5.2 million bonus. In 2015, Khan also received $145.3 million worth of Snap shares as a sign-up bonus. Spiegel and Murphy will maintain tight control over Snap's stock through a unique three-share class structure. The structure will give Spiegel and Murphy the right of 10 votes for every share. Existing investors will have one vote for each of their shares, while new investors will have no voting rights. Snap said it couldn't predict if the structure would "result in a lower trading price or greater fluctuations" in the stock. Keeping tight control is common in companies closely associated with their founders, who often prefer to grow their business without being questioned by a broad array of investors. Still, offering a class of stock with no votes in an IPO is unprecedented. Though the structure has drawn some criticism for not giving stock market investors the opportunity to have input, some people close to the company have argued that investors can "vote with their feet" by not buying into the IPO if they are not comfortable with the arrangements. "Investors have to decide, am I going to avail myself of the opportunity to buy the stock, and forget about the fact that somewhere down the road they are likely going to run into trouble?" said James McRitchie, an independent corporate governance activist who has pressed for more equal voting rights at companies including Facebook. Paying Google Snap had $404.5 million (roughly Rs. 2,725 crores) in sales in 2016, up from $58.7 million in 2015. However, it had adjusted losses before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization last year of $459 million, compared with $292.9 million in 2015. Snap's biggest losses stem from "hosting fees" which it pays to cloud computing companies such as Google to use their infrastructure for its data. It will pay Google $2 billion over the next five years to use its cloud computing services. Because Snapchat users rely heavily on data-heavy pictures and video, the cost of these service is high. Still, the proportion of the company's costs to its revenue has been declining. Its strategy has been to bargain for better hosting rates as its growing number of users buoys its negotiating leverage. "They are adding infrastructure ahead of growth, and that is why you have some front-loading of losses," said SharesPost's Kulkarni. Some companies such as Facebook have their own hosting platforms, though this model can be more costly. Facebook's Instagram, which recently introduced disappearing video content similar to Snapchat, had 600 million users as of late last year. Like Snapchat, Instagram sells advertising on its platform. Snap's aggressive expansion is reflected in its staff numbers. By the end of last year, it had increased its number of employees to 1,859 from 600 in 2015. Snap said it would use the proceeds from its IPO for general purposes, including working capital, operating expenses and capital expenditures. Snap said it will list on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker SNAP.

Snap’s publication on Thursday of its IPO registration document sets the stage for its upcoming marketing campaign to convince investors to look past its widening losses and the firm grip of its founders, and focus on its rapid growth of active users. The number of Snap’s daily active users grew to an average of 158 million at the end of December, up 48 percent year-on-year, Snap revealed. However, its net loss widened to $514.6 million in 2016 from $372.9 million the year before. While Snap will have time to polish its marketing pitch in the run-up to the IPO planned for March, some analysts were taken aback that the company was just beginning to reap cash from its product. “What surprises me the most is that it is still very early days when it comes to Snap making money,” said Rohit Kulkarni, managing director at private securities investment firm SharesPost. Snap had confidentially registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for an IPO late last year. It kept the filing under such tight wraps, even some of its IPO underwriters had not seen it prior to publication on Thursday, sources familiar with the matter previously told Reuters. Snap said in the IPO registration document published on Thursday it would become the first U.S. company to go public with shares on offer not granting voting rights to stock market investors. Its founders, Evan Spiegel and Robert Murphy, will keep control of the company. Snap could be valued at between $20 billion to $25 billion, according to sources familiar with the situation who asked not to be named because the matter is confidential. That would give the company the richest valuation in a U.S. technology IPO since Facebook Inc. Snap, which launched itself in 2012 with an app that sends disappearing messages, rebranded itself last year as a camera company and started selling $130 video camera glasses. It generates the majority of its revenue from advertising, seeking to challenge the dominance of internet giants such as Facebook and Alphabet Inc’s Google. “The industry has been crying out for new advertising units” says Ian Schafer, founder and chairman of ad agency Deep Focus, referring to the tight hold Facebook and Google have on the digital advertising marketplace. In its IPO registration document, Snap cited Apple Inc, Google, Twitter Inc, Facebook and its photo-sharing platform Instagram as its competitors. Tight Control Spiegel, the 26-year-old Snap co-founder, last year earned $503,205 in salary, with a $1 million bonus. Imran Khan, Snapchat’s chief strategy officer whom it hired from investment bank Credit Suisse Group AG in 2014, earned $241,539 last year with a $5.2 million bonus. In 2015, Khan also received $145.3 million worth of Snap shares as a sign-up bonus. Spiegel and Murphy will maintain tight control over Snap’s stock through a unique three-share class structure. The structure will give Spiegel and Murphy the right of 10 votes for every share. Existing investors will have one vote for each of their shares, while new investors will have no voting rights. Snap said it couldn’t predict if the structure would “result in a lower trading price or greater fluctuations” in the stock. Keeping tight control is common in companies closely associated with their founders, who often prefer to grow their business without being questioned by a broad array of investors. Still, offering a class of stock with no votes in an IPO is unprecedented. Though the structure has drawn some criticism for not giving stock market investors the opportunity to have input, some people close to the company have argued that investors can “vote with their feet” by not buying into the IPO if they are not comfortable with the arrangements. “Investors have to decide, am I going to avail myself of the opportunity to buy the stock, and forget about the fact that somewhere down the road they are likely going to run into trouble?” said James McRitchie, an independent corporate governance activist who has pressed for more equal voting rights at companies including Facebook. Paying Google Snap had $404.5 million in sales in 2016, up from $58.7 million in 2015. However, it had adjusted losses before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization last year of $459 million, compared with $292.9 million in 2015.  Snap’s biggest losses stem from “hosting fees” which it pays to cloud computing companies such as Google to use their infrastructure for its data. It will pay Google $2 billion over the next five years to use its cloud computing services. Because Snapchat users rely heavily on data-heavy pictures and video, the cost of these service is high. Still, the proportion of the company’s costs to its revenue has been declining. Its strategy has been to bargain for better hosting rates as its growing number of users buoys its negotiating leverage. “They are adding infrastructure ahead of growth, and that is why you have some front-loading of losses,” said SharesPost’s Kulkarni. Some companies such as Facebook have their own hosting platforms, though this model can be more costly. Facebook’s Instagram, which recently introduced disappearing video content similar to Snapchat, had 600 million users as of late last year. Like Snapchat, Instagram sells advertising on its platform. Snap’s aggressive expansion is reflected in its staff numbers. By the end of last year, it had increased its number of employees to 1,859 from 600 in 2015. Snap said it would use the proceeds from its IPO for general purposes, including working capital, operating expenses and capital expenditures. Snap said it will list on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker SNAP. Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs Group Inc, JPMorgan Chase & Co and Deutsche Bank AG are leading the offering as underwriters.

And that’s left their Hamptons-style home in Vaucluse all but redundant. But no longer. This week the Parsley Bay property hit the market with a $5.5 million to $5.9 million guide through Michael Pallier, of Sotheby’s International. Held in Temsamani’s name, the 565-square-metre property that backs onto Parsley Bay Reserve last traded in 2010 for $4.75 million after a major renovation by former owners Ord Minnett’s investment advisor Chris Mathews and communication consultant Jane Mathews. Google’s Karim Temsamani is selling his Vaucluse home. Photo: Supplied At the time France-born Temsamani was heading up of Google’s mobile operations, and the couple were trading up from their former Kensington property they sold in 2010 for $2.7 million. Records show the five-bedroom, three-bathroom home has been an executive rental in recent years, earning $3000 a week. What’s in the stars Renowned astrologer Richard Sterling was compulsory reading for many truth seekers of the Australian Women’s Weekly in the 1970s and 1980s, best known for his sometimes vaguely correct annual predictions for the royal family and tips on gardening by the stars. The Katoomba home of the late astrologer Richard Sterling. Photo: Supplied Sterling, who was also an accomplished pianist, was a long-time Blue Mountains resident, where he bought his clifftop home overlooking the Jamison Valley in 1968 for $16,000. Almost 50 years later the two-storey property is for sale by his widow Joy following his death in 2013. The four-bedroom house was built in 1950 and includes panoramic views, multiple living areas and a zodiac garden as featured in Burke’s Backyard in 1992. Tailor Patrick Johnson and his interior designer wife Tamsin are selling their Darling Point apartment.

Fashionistas make a move Patrick Johnson, of bespoke tailor P. Johnson Tailors, and his interior designer wife Tamsin Johnson are trading in their Darling Point apartment for $3.85 million house in Tamarama. Records show the couple’s plan to redesign the beachside home is already underway, having purchased the former family home of Philip Green, until recently the Australian High Commissioner in Singapore. Fashion designer Lizzie Collins and her husband Peter are selling their 1950s-era home in Woollahra. Photo: Supplied It was a similar story on the couple’s Darling Point apartment, which they purchased in 2012 for $1,065,000 and have completely redesigned, no doubt thanks to Tamsin Johnson’s interior design skills. The whole-floor spread in a boutique block of three goes to auction on February 23 for between $1.3 million and $1.4 million through Gavin Rubinstein, of Ray White Double Bay. Meanwhile, iconic ’80s fashion designer Lizzie Collins and her husband Peter are selling their 1950s-era home in Woollahra for some $7 million. Painaustralia chief and founder Lesley Brydon is selling her designer townhouse in Tamarama. Photo: Supplied The five-bedroom home with a private garden and swimming pool is set on more than 1000 square metres and is billed as having a “Palm Springs-style aesthetic” in the marketing by Michael Dunn, of Richardson & Wrench Double Bay. Having purchased the Edgecliff Road home in 1987 for $850,000 from the Bloom family, it is set for auction on February 22. Brydon lists home to downsize It is with a heavy heart that Lesley Brydon, founder and chief executive of the Painaustralia charity, has listed her Tamarama home to downsize to something local by the beach. The Longueville property of the late Rod Macdonald and his widow Robin is for sale for between $3.5 million and $3.8 million. Photo: Supplied Brydon’s four-bedroom, three-bathroom townhouse is one of three in a row designed and built by architect Jake Dowse, which she purchased from supermodel-turn-fashion designer Gail Elliott and her husband Joe Coffey for $2.8 million in 2005. At the time the glamorous fashionistas purchased Dowse’s home next door for $3,175,000, and then sold it three years later for $4.82 million. Depending on where buyer’s agent Dennis Kalofonos finds her downsizer digs, the sale is likely to end Brydon’s 37 years as a Tamarama local, having first bought into the suburb in 1980 on Wonderland Avenue with her then husband, the late TV presenter and journalist Peter Wherrett. Alexander Phillips, of Phillips Pantzer Donnelley, is asking $4.6 million for Brydon’s Fletcher Street home ahead of a February 25 auction. Mosman’s Kirkoswald Avenue residence designed by architect Bill Payne is for sale. Photo: Supplied Another chance for Nirvana The historic Longueville home of the late obstetrician and gynaecologist Rod Macdonald and his widow Robin is for sale ending 44 years of family ownership of one of the suburb’s oldest remaining residences. The Macdonalds are only the third owners of the grand 1898-built property, Nirvana, which was first owned by the family of Alfred Paine Fox for 68 years. It was bought by medico Frank Sharpe in 1958, and sold to the Macdonald family in 1973. The childhood home of ABC Radio presenter Sarah Macdonald has been a long-term restoration project by the family in the decades since, with architect redesigns in 1978 and 1986. Set on a battle-axe block next door to Longueville’s historic Carrum Carrum (which sold to Chinese buyers 2014 for $5.01 million and has remained largely unoccupied ever since, it goes to auction on February 25 for $3.5 million to $3.8 million through Brent Courtney, of McGrath. Going retro in Mosman Lovers of 1960s architecture take note: Mosman’s retro home of modernist commercial architect Bill Payne and his late wife Margaret is up for grabs for the first time since the couple built it in 1965. The Kirkoswald Avenue property was built on a block, since subdivided, on which Payne also designed the house next door before he sold that off in 1993. Payne and Jim Whitehead co-founded Whitehead & Payne architecture firm, designing such landmarks as Roselands Shopping Centre and Top Ryde Shopping Centre. Tim Foote, of Belle Property Mosman, is asking $4.5 million to $5 million for the Kirkoswald Avenue property. Domain Home Price Guide Find out what your property's worth Find out now!

In addition to being able to see photo albums from your Google Photos account, youll be able to scroll to the left to see photos saved internally. The actual Photos on device screen also looks a bit different, more like a traditional gallery, rather than displaying six photos of each folder. Photos: Albums view (2.7)  Device folders (2.7)  Albums view (2.8)  Photos on device (2.8) In the past, If you wanted to see (for instance) a screenshot that you took a couple of weeks ago, you would need to tap the burger menu, and tap Device folders. Its easy for a seasoned smartphone user to poke around and find the menu, but not for those folks who arent particularly inclined to welcome changes in their user interface.

Tech Insider BI Intelligence Events Trending Tech Insider Finance Politics Strategy Life Sports Video All × From To You have successfully emailed the post. 13 clever jokes from Google that probably went right over your head Avery Hartmans Jan. 30, 2017, 10:38 AM 337,672 facebook linkedin twitter email print Google Google frequently makes us giggle with the geeky ways it handles things. Like the time it rewarded the man who managed to buy the "Google.com" domain for one minute: Google gave researcher Sanmay Ved $6,006.13, choosing that specific amount because it spells out Google, numerically — "squint a little and you'll see it!" the company said. This kind of quirky antic has become almost par for the course for the search giant, which has long been down for a little nerdy fun. "Googleyness" is all about intellectual creativity, after all. Here are some of our other favorite times that Google did or responded to something in a particularly silly way. Jillian D'Onfro contributed to an earlier version of this story. View As: One Page Slides It all started with the IPO. Google used a funny string of numbers in its initial S-1 filing for how much it hoped to raise. Google The first 10 digits of the mathematical constant "e" are 2,718,281,828. Then, a year later, Google collected a bit more than $4 billion by selling 14,159,265 million of its shares. Flickr / Bill Ward Get it? Because "14,159,265" are the first eight digits after the decimal point in the number pi. The search giant showed off its numerical whimsy again in 2011, when it bid $1,902,160,540 and $2,614,972,128 for some wireless patents. REUTERS/Peter Power In case those numbers don't instantly ring a bell: They're Brun's constant and the Meissel-Mertens constant, respectively. Google didn't end up winning the patents, but it definitely mystified other bidders. In another auction, Google spent $25 million to buy the entire ".app" domain. But the clever part came when we followed up with the company about it. REUTERS/Guadalupe Pardo "We've been excited and curious about the potential for new top-level domains (TLDs) for .soy long," a Google representative told Business Insider in a pun-riddled email. "We are very .app-y with .how, at a .minna-mum, they have the potential to .foo-ward internet innovation." The company has also responded to press questions with memes. It sent The Verge this one when it revealed that a weird skull showing up in people's Gmail accounts was caused by a bug in its own in-house debugger. Google Source: The Verge Google once even got a little risqué with this response. Inverse Read the story at Inverse. And once it addressed an issue where Google Maps was showing Sauron's tower from "The Lord of the Rings" as appearing in Australia with a comment ... in Elvish. Google "If your Elvish is a bit rusty, here is a rough translation," the representative said. "We encourage users to contribute their local knowledge and updates using Google Map Maker, even the whims of Sauron will not compromise our quest to provide useful and accurate maps." Google has recruited new developers using super-cryptic challenges that people can only access through a secret website. Google And when Business Insider reached out to Google about this recruiting technique, we received the following response: " import string z=string.ascii_lowercase m=''.join([z[6],z[11],z[7],z[5]]) print(m) " The message? "GLHF," which stands for "Good luck, have fun!" A few months after Google became Alphabet in 2015, it bought the entire alphabet as a domain name, with the URL abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz.com. Flickr / Scott Veg "We realized we missed a few letters in abc.xyz, so we're just being thorough," a representative told Re/code. In the same vein, Alphabet also bought back a bunch of stock for $5,099,019,513.59. Thomson Reuters That's the square root of 26, the number of letters in the alphabet, times a billion. Not about numbers, but pretty funny: In its official code of conduct, Google declares itself a "dog company"... Amy Lombard/VSCO "Google's affection for our canine friends is an integral facet of our corporate culture," reads the company's code of conduct on its investor-relations site. "We like cats, but we're a dog company, so as a general rule we feel cats visiting our offices would be fairly stressed out." ... a fact that the company made sure to reference again in 2015 after the press noted that new parent company Alphabet didn't include Google's famous "don't be evil" line in its new code of conduct. Thomson Reuters After The Wall Street Journal's Alistair Barr caught the change, the company sent him a cheeky response. "Individual Alphabet companies may of course have their own codes to ensure they continue to promote compliance and great values," a Google spokesman said. "But if they start bringing cats to work, there's gonna be trouble with a capital T." When a report surfaced from WWD earlier in 2017 that Google could potentially buy Condé Nast, Google's communications team took the opportunity to write a clever response. WWD While some people found Google's response pretty funny, WWD made a wisecrack of their own, responding: "Maybe they Googled how to write a witty response" SEE ALSO: The meteoric rise of Google CEO Sundar Pichai, in photos More: Features Google Alphabet Easter eggs facebook linkedin twitter email print × Recommended For You Powered by Sailthru 13 clever jokes from Google that probably went right over your head 13 clever jokes from Google that probably went right over your head Google frequently makes us giggle with the...

Twitter Facebook Snap is paying Google $400M a year for cloud services Snap has agreed to a minimum annual cloud bill roughly equal to its 2016 revenue Blair Hanley Frank (IDG News Service) 03 February, 2017 16:16 - - - - print email Comments Over the next five years, the company behind Snapchat will pay Google at least US$2 billion in cloud bills. On Thursday, Snap revealed in a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission that it signed a five-year contract to pay Google at least $400 million a year for cloud services. That's a steep figure, considering that Snap made roughly $404 million last year.  In return for the massive commitment, Snap will receive reduced pricing, though it’s not clear how deep the company’s discounts will be. Sinking a bunch of money into Google Cloud makes sense, because Snapchat began its life built on top of Google’s AppEngine platform-as-a-service offering. Furthermore, Snap’s commitment to Google is a massive vote of confidence in the latter’s cloud capabilities, at a time when there’s heavy competition in the cloud market. Right now, Google’s cloud is an underdog compared to Microsoft and Amazon. But being tied to a rising star in the social media landscape like Snapchat could help draw other companies to at least give Google’s platform a chance. However, the contract is not without risk. If Snap doesn’t use $400 million worth of Google Cloud services in a year, it’s still on the hook for the full value of the contract. What’s more, the company said in the filing that it uses Google for the “vast majority” of its “computing, storage, bandwidth, and other services.” If something goes wrong with Google Cloud, or if the tech titan gets out of the public cloud business, it could be bad news for Snap. That last scenario seems highly unlikely, considering that Google continues increasing its investment in its cloud platform. Urs Hölzle, Google’s vice president of technical infrastructure, said last year that the company plans to launch new cloud data centers at the rate of roughly one each month this year. All of this is tied to Snap’s plans to pursue an initial public offering in the near future. The filing released on Thursday is one of the company’s steps along that path. Snap’s IPO is being closely observed by the tech industry because of the company’s high-flying status. It remains to be seen how Wall Street will receive the company, especially since it’s far from profitable and its losses have widened year over year. Plus, the deal with Google means that Snap will be saddled with hundreds of millions of dollars in liabilities for the foreseeable future.

On Thursday, Snap revealed in a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission that it signed a five-year contract to pay Google at least $400 million a year for cloud services. That's a steep figure, considering that Snap made roughly $404 million last year.  In return for the massive commitment, Snap will receive reduced pricing, though it’s not clear how deep the company’s discounts will be. Sinking a bunch of money into Google Cloud makes sense, because Snapchat began its life built on top of Google’s AppEngine platform-as-a-service offering. Furthermore, Snap’s commitment to Google is a massive vote of confidence in the latter’s cloud capabilities, at a time when there’s heavy competition in the cloud market. Right now, Google’s cloud is an underdog compared to Microsoft and Amazon. But being tied to a rising star in the social media landscape like Snapchat could help draw other companies to at least give Google’s platform a chance. However, the contract is not without risk. If Snap doesn’t use $400 million worth of Google Cloud services in a year, it’s still on the hook for the full value of the contract. What’s more, the company said in the filing that it uses Google for the “vast majority” of its “computing, storage, bandwidth, and other services.” If something goes wrong with Google Cloud, or if the tech titan gets out of the public cloud business, it could be bad news for Snap.

Snap's publication on Thursday of its IPO registration document sets the stage for its upcoming marketing campaign to convince investors to look past its widening losses and the firm grip of its founders, and focus on its rapid growth of active users. The number of Snap's daily active users grew to an average of 158 million at the end of December, up 48 percent year-on-year, Snap revealed. However, its net loss widened to $514.6 million in 2016 from $372.9 million the year before. While Snap will have time to polish its marketing pitch in the run-up to the IPO planned for March, some analysts were taken aback that the company was just beginning to reap cash from its product. "What surprises me the most is that it is still very early days when it comes to Snap making money," said Rohit Kulkarni, managing director at private securities investment firm SharesPost. Snap had confidentially registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for an IPO late last year. It kept the filing under such tight wraps, even some of its IPO underwriters had not seen it prior to publication on Thursday, sources familiar with the matter previously told Reuters. Snap said in the IPO registration document published on Thursday it would become the first U.S. company to go public with shares on offer not granting voting rights to stock market investors. Its founders, Evan Spiegel and Robert Murphy, will keep control of the company. Snap could be valued at between $20 billion to $25 billion, according to sources familiar with the situation who asked not to be named because the matter is confidential. That would give the company the richest valuation in a U.S. technology IPO since Facebook Inc. Snap, which launched itself in 2012 with an app that sends disappearing messages, rebranded itself last year as a camera company and started selling $130 video camera glasses. It generates the majority of its revenue from advertising, seeking to challenge the dominance of internet giants such as Facebook and Alphabet Inc's Google. "The industry has been crying out for new advertising units" says Ian Schafer, founder and chairman of ad agency Deep Focus, referring to the tight hold Facebook and Google have on the digital advertising marketplace. In its IPO registration document, Snap cited Apple Inc, Google, Twitter Inc, Facebook and its photo-sharing platform Instagram as its competitors.   TIGHT CONTROL Spiegel, the 26-year-old Snap co-founder, last year earned $503,205 in salary, with a $1 million bonus. Imran Khan, Snapchat's chief strategy officer whom it hired from investment bank Credit Suisse Group AG in 2014, earned $241,539 last year with a $5.2 million bonus. In 2015, Khan also received $145.3 million worth of Snap shares as a sign-up bonus. Spiegel and Murphy will maintain tight control over Snap's stock through a unique three-share class structure. The structure will give Spiegel and Murphy the right of 10 votes for every share. Existing investors will have one vote for each of their shares, while new investors will have no voting rights. Snap said it couldn't predict if the structure would "result in a lower trading price or greater fluctuations" in the stock. Keeping tight control is common in companies closely associated with their founders, who often prefer to grow their business without being questioned by a broad array of investors. Still, offering a class of stock with no votes in an IPO is unprecedented. Though the structure has drawn some criticism for not giving stock market investors the opportunity to have input, some people close to the company have argued that investors can "vote with their feet" by not buying into the IPO if they are not comfortable with the arrangements. "Investors have to decide, am I going to avail myself of the opportunity to buy the stock, and forget about the fact that somewhere down the road they are likely going to run into trouble?" said James McRitchie, an independent corporate governance activist who has pressed for more equal voting rights at companies including Facebook.   PAYING GOOGLE Snap had $404.5 million in sales in 2016, up from $58.7 million in 2015. However, it had adjusted losses before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization last year of $459 million, compared with $292.9 million in 2015. Snap's biggest losses stem from "hosting fees" which it pays to cloud computing companies such as Google to use their infrastructure for its data. It will pay Google $2 billion over the next five years to use its cloud computing services. Because Snapchat users rely heavily on data-heavy pictures and video, the cost of these service is high. Still, the proportion of the company's costs to its revenue has been declining. Its strategy has been to bargain for better hosting rates as its growing number of users buoys its negotiating leverage. "They are adding infrastructure ahead of growth, and that is why you have some front-loading of losses," said SharesPost's Kulkarni. Some companies such as Facebook have their own hosting platforms, though this model can be more costly. Facebook's Instagram, which recently introduced disappearing video content similar to Snapchat, had 600 million users as of late last year. Like Snapchat, Instagram sells advertising on its platform. Snap's aggressive expansion is reflected in its staff numbers. By the end of last year, it had increased its number of employees to 1,859 from 600 in 2015. Snap said it would use the proceeds from its IPO for general purposes, including working capital, operating expenses and capital expenditures.

A billboard displays the logo of Snapchat above Times Square in New York March 12, 2015. Snap's publication on Thursday of its IPO registration document sets the stage for its upcoming marketing campaign to convince investors to look past its widening losses and the firm grip of its founders, and focus on its rapid growth of active users. The number of Snap's daily active users grew to an average of 158 million at the end of December, up 48 percent year-on-year, Snap revealed. However, its net loss widened to $514.6 million in 2016 from $372.9 million the year before. While Snap will have time to polish its marketing pitch in the run-up to the IPO planned for March, some analysts were taken aback that the company was just beginning to reap cash from its product. "What surprises me the most is that it is still very early days when it comes to Snap making money," said Rohit Kulkarni, managing director at private securities investment firm SharesPost. Snap had confidentially registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for an IPO late last year. It kept the filing under such tight wraps, even some of its IPO underwriters had not seen it prior to publication on Thursday, sources familiar with the matter previously told Reuters. Snap said in the IPO registration document published on Thursday it would become the first U.S. company to go public with shares on offer not granting voting rights to stock market investors. Its founders, Evan Spiegel and Robert Murphy, will keep control of the company. Snap could be valued at between $20 billion to $25 billion, according to sources familiar with the situation who asked not to be named because the matter is confidential. That would give the company the richest valuation in a U.S. technology IPO since Facebook Inc. Snap, which launched itself in 2012 with an app that sends disappearing messages, rebranded itself last year as a camera company and started selling $130 video camera glasses. It generates the majority of its revenue from advertising, seeking to challenge the dominance of internet giants such as Facebook and Alphabet Inc's Google. "The industry has been crying out for new advertising units" says Ian Schafer, founder and chairman of ad agency Deep Focus, referring to the tight hold Facebook and Google have on the digital advertising marketplace. In its IPO registration document, Snap cited Apple Inc, Google, Twitter Inc, Facebook and its photo-sharing platform Instagram as its competitors. TIGHT CONTROL Spiegel, the 26-year-old Snap co-founder, last year earned $503,205 in salary, with a $1 million bonus. Imran Khan, Snapchat's chief strategy officer whom it hired from investment bank Credit Suisse Group AG in 2014, earned $241,539 last year with a $5.2 million bonus. In 2015, Khan also received $145.3 million worth of Snap shares as a sign-up bonus. Spiegel and Murphy will maintain tight control over Snap's stock through a unique three-share class structure. The structure will give Spiegel and Murphy the right of 10 votes for every share. Existing investors will have one vote for each of their shares, while new investors will have no voting rights. Snap said it couldn't predict if the structure would "result in a lower trading price or greater fluctuations" in the stock. Keeping tight control is common in companies closely associated with their founders, who often prefer to grow their business without being questioned by a broad array of investors. Still, offering a class of stock with no votes in an IPO is unprecedented. Though the structure has drawn some criticism for not giving stock market investors the opportunity to have input, some people close to the company have argued that investors can "vote with their feet" by not buying into the IPO if they are not comfortable with the arrangements. "Investors have to decide, am I going to avail myself of the opportunity to buy the stock, and forget about the fact that somewhere down the road they are likely going to run into trouble?" said James McRitchie, an independent corporate governance activist who has pressed for more equal voting rights at companies including Facebook. PAYING GOOGLE Snap had $404.5 million in sales in 2016, up from $58.7 million in 2015. However, it had adjusted losses before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization last year of $459 million, compared with $292.9 million in 2015. Snap's biggest losses stem from "hosting fees" which it pays to cloud computing companies such as Google to use their infrastructure for its data. It will pay Google $2 billion over the next five years to use its cloud computing services. Because Snapchat users rely heavily on data-heavy pictures and video, the cost of these service is high. Still, the proportion of the company's costs to its revenue has been declining. Its strategy has been to bargain for better hosting rates as its growing number of users buoys its negotiating leverage. "They are adding infrastructure ahead of growth, and that is why you have some front-loading of losses," said SharesPost's Kulkarni. Some companies such as Facebook have their own hosting platforms, though this model can be more costly. Facebook's Instagram, which recently introduced disappearing video content similar to Snapchat, had 600 million users as of late last year. Like Snapchat, Instagram sells advertising on its platform. Snap's aggressive expansion is reflected in its staff numbers. By the end of last year, it had increased its number of employees to 1,859 from 600 in 2015. Snap said it would use the proceeds from its IPO for general purposes, including working capital, operating expenses and capital expenditures. Snap said it will list on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker SNAP. Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs Group Inc, JPMorgan Chase & Co and Deutsche Bank AG are leading the offering as underwriters.

As explained by Google: “Now when you’re searching on the Google app for a particular recipe, you’ll see a carousel of tappable suggestions to make sure you catch the best recipe to suit your taste buds and kitchen skills.” Look familiar at all? That’s because it’s almost exactly the same as Pinterest’s ‘Guided Search’. Pinterest launched Guided Search back in 2014, and they’ve been refining it ever since. The development of Guided Search has lead to Pinterest now facilitating more than two billion searches every month – in fact, just this week Pinterest announced new search ads to capitalize on this rising interest. Google clearly has some concerns about losing search traffic – which makes sense, two billion searches on another platform are two billion less its facilitating. Combine that with search activity on other platforms (Facebook sees more than 1.5 billion searches a day) and it’s no surprise that Google would be looking at ways to innovate in line with audience trends. The announcement underlines the growing relevance of social as a search and discovery tool, and an innovator in the online space. Like with Instagram copying Snapchat Stories, the platforms are starting to become more aligned, as dictated by user response - if there’s a function that works and another platform can adapt it, they will. The risk is that we lose differentiation and innovation, but the leading platforms know that they do need both of these elements to progress. It just might be that someone else comes up with them first, effectively doing the R and D work on their behalf. Google’s new ‘Recipe Search’ is available now in the Google app. Author Information Andrew Hutchinson Writer/Moderator @adhutchinson Sign up for the Social Media Today newsletter You'll get a daily email with the latest news, lessons, and insights on: Social Media Marketing Digital Strategy and more Yes, I'd like to receive Marketing Dive's daily newsletter as well.

It kept the filing under such tight wraps, even some of its IPO underwriters had not seen it prior to publication on Thursday, sources familiar with the matter previously told Reuters. Snap said in the IPO registration document published on Thursday it would become the first U.S. company to go public with shares on offer not granting voting rights to stock market investors. Its founders, Evan Spiegel and Robert Murphy, will keep control of the company. Snap could be valued at between $20 billion to $25 billion, according to sources familiar with the situation who asked not to be named because the matter is confidential. That would give the company the richest valuation in a U.S. technology IPO since Facebook Inc. Snap, which launched itself in 2012 with an app that sends disappearing messages, rebranded itself last year as a camera company and started selling $130 video camera glasses. It generates the majority of its revenue from advertising, seeking to challenge the dominance of internet giants such as Facebook and Alphabet Inc's Google. "The industry has been crying out for new advertising units" says Ian Schafer, founder and chairman of ad agency Deep Focus, referring to the tight hold Facebook and Google have on the digital advertising marketplace. In its IPO registration document, Snap cited Apple Inc, Google, Twitter Inc, Facebook and its photo-sharing platform Instagram as its competitors. TIGHT CONTROL Spiegel, the 26-year-old Snap co-founder, last year earned $503,205 in salary, with a $1 million bonus. Imran Khan, Snapchat's chief strategy officer whom it hired from investment bank Credit Suisse Group AG in 2014, earned $241,539 last year with a $5.2 million bonus. In 2015, Khan also received $145.3 million worth of Snap shares as a sign-up bonus. Spiegel and Murphy will maintain tight control over Snap's stock through a unique three-share class structure. The structure will give Spiegel and Murphy the right of 10 votes for every share. Existing investors will have one vote for each of their shares, while new investors will have no voting rights. Snap said it couldn't predict if the structure would "result in a lower trading price or greater fluctuations" in the stock. Keeping tight control is common in companies closely associated with their founders, who often prefer to grow their business without being questioned by a broad array of investors. Still, offering a class of stock with no votes in an IPO is unprecedented. Though the structure has drawn some criticism for not giving stock market investors the opportunity to have input, some people close to the company have argued that investors can "vote with their feet" by not buying into the IPO if they are not comfortable with the arrangements. "Investors have to decide, am I going to avail myself of the opportunity to buy the stock, and forget about the fact that somewhere down the road they are likely going to run into trouble?" said James McRitchie, an independent corporate governance activist who has pressed for more equal voting rights at companies including Facebook. PAYING GOOGLE Snap had $404.5 million in sales in 2016, up from $58.7 million in 2015. However, it had adjusted losses before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization last year of $459 million, compared with $292.9 million in 2015. Snap's biggest losses stem from "hosting fees" which it pays to cloud computing companies such as Google to use their infrastructure for its data. It will pay Google $2 billion over the next five years to use its cloud computing services. Because Snapchat users rely heavily on data-heavy pictures and video, the cost of these service is high. Still, the proportion of the company's costs to its revenue has been declining. Its strategy has been to bargain for better hosting rates as its growing number of users buoys its negotiating leverage. "They are adding infrastructure ahead of growth, and that is why you have some front-loading of losses," said SharesPost's Kulkarni. Some companies such as Facebook have their own hosting platforms, though this model can be more costly. Facebook's Instagram, which recently introduced disappearing video content similar to Snapchat, had 600 million users as of late last year. Like Snapchat, Instagram sells advertising on its platform. Snap's aggressive expansion is reflected in its staff numbers. By the end of last year, it had increased its number of employees to 1,859 from 600 in 2015. Snap said it would use the proceeds from its IPO for general purposes, including working capital, operating expenses and capital expenditures.

Reuters Business Standard http://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/wap/images/bs_logo_amp.png 177 22 Snap shoots for the sky, promises little in $3 billion IPO pitch By Lauren Hirsch and Liana B. Baker (Reuters) - Snapchat owner Snap Inc shot the opening salvo in its $3 billion initial public offering on Thursday, outlining aggressive expansion plans but offering new investors no say on how the company is run and no promise of profits. Snap's publication on Thursday of its IPO registration document sets the stage for its upcoming marketing campaign to convince investors to look past its widening losses and the firm grip of its founders, and focus on its rapid growth of active users. The number of Snap's daily active users grew to an average of 158 million at the end of December, up 48 percent year-on-year, Snap revealed. However, its net loss widened to $514.6 million in 2016 from $372.9 million the year before. While Snap will have time to polish its marketing pitch in the run-up to the IPO planned for March, some analysts were taken aback that the company was just beginning to reap cash from its product.

Alex Barinka Snapchat’s net loss widened to $515 million in 2016, on revenue of $404 million, according to the prospectus filed on Thursday. Photo: Bloomberg New York: Snap Inc., the maker of the disappearing photo app Snapchat, filed publicly for an initial offering, the first US social-media company to do so since Twitter Inc. more than three years ago. The company filed with an initial size of $3 billion, a placeholder amount used to calculate fees that may change. Snap plans to raise as much as $4 billion in the IPO, people familiar with the matter have said, for a market value of as much as $25 billion. The company’s net loss widened to $515 million in 2016, on revenue of $404 million, according to the prospectus filed on Thursday. That compares with a loss of $382 million in 2015, on revenue of $59 million. Snapchat has more than 158 million daily active users, the prospectus shows. Quarterly average revenue per user on a global basis climbed to $1.05 in the fourth quarter of 2016, compared with 31 cents in the fourth quarter of 2015. Snap plans to use proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, which may include acquisitions, the filing shows. The company said it relies on Alphabet Inc.’s Google for most of its computing, storage and bandwidth, and any disruptions to Google’s cloud functioning could “seriously” hurt its business. Snap said it plans to spend $2 billion with Alphabet over the next five years to use Google’s cloud-computing services. It also noted that because Snapchat is used primarily on mobile devices, it relies on Google’s Android operating system and Apple Inc.’s operating system, over which it has no control. Snap also competes with those companies. Facebook, Twitter In addition to Google and Apple, Snap named Facebook Inc., including its WhatsApp and Instagram applications, and Twitter Inc. as significant competitors. Last year, Snapchat filed confidentially for an IPO with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act. The Jobs Act is a venue for companies with revenue of less than $1 billion to file privately and work out details with the SEC away from the public eye. The IPO prospectus is the first opportunity for outsiders to get a closer look into a company that’s known for, among other things, its culture of secrecy. The next step will be the roadshow, in which chief executive officer Evan Spiegel and his management team will endeavor to explain the company’s strategy and prospects to potential investors. Benchmark Capital holds 12.7% of Class A shares and 22.8% of Class B shares, for a total voting power of 2.7% before the offering. Lightspeed Venture Partners holds 8.3% of Class A shares and 15% of Class B stock, for total voting power of 1.8%. Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. are leading the offering with JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Deutsche Bank AG. Barclays Plc, Credit Suisse Group AG and Allen & Co. are also on the deal. Snap plans to list its Class A shares on the New York Stock Exchange, under the symbol SNAP.

MUST CREDIT: Washington Post photo by Jabin Botsford. By Matthew Campbell, WP Bloomberg Jan 30, 2017 at 8:29 am | Print View President Donald Trump vowed to end business as usual in Washington. Global companies are now learning just what that means. What began before his inauguration, with attempts to cajole corporations like Toyota into keeping jobs in the U.S. with critical tweets, is now escalating into a crucial test for business leaders trying to maintain the cross-border flows of people and goods that underpin commerce in the 21st century. Trump’s Friday signing of an executive order barring the citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the U.S., on the heels of his war of words with Mexico over trade, alarmed executives from big employers including General Electric, Google and Microsoft. A chaotic weekend of protests, emergency court hearings and White House rebuttals left executives with a tricky choice: speak out and risk drawing fire from an outspoken president, or stay silent and face criticism from employees and activists. GE Chief Executive Officer Jeff Immelt’s response underscored the delicate balance business will have to strike. “We have many employees from the named countries and we do business all over the region,” he said in an internal email. While he called those staff “critical to our success,” he avoided direct criticism of Trump’s policy. GE “will continue to make our voice heard with the new administration and congress and reiterate the importance of this issue,” he said. Trump’s order shut the door to nationals of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen — including refugees, visiting scholars and, at least temporarily, even permanent American residents who happened to be abroad for work or holidays. Confusion reigned in the first 48 hours of its implementation, with border agents and airlines unsure how to interpret the rules. The decision, termed a “Muslim ban” by critics, fulfills a campaign promise that even Trump allies had suggested shouldn’t be taken literally, signaling the White House’s new occupant is committed to at least some of his most controversial pledges. “We would never think this would become any kind of an issue,” Ludwig Willisch, chief executive officer of North American operations at Bayerische Motoren Werke AG, said at an automotive conference on Saturday. “This country is a melting pot, freedom of speech, everybody gets together and creates this great country. So, we were not prepared for this kind of thing.” Criticism from pockets of corporate America, which was matched by statements from the leaders of Germany, France, and Canada, stood in stark contrast to the warm words toward Trump just a week ago. Executives at the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting in Switzerland, including AT&T’s Randall Stephenson and JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s Jamie Dimon, praised Trump’s promises to overhaul corporate taxes and invest in infrastructure. Optimists suggested he would quietly drop pledges to tear up trade deals and reconsider defense commitments to allies. Trump has “had this extraordinary honeymoon where Wall Street has kind of discounted all the negative aspects,” Richard Fenning, the CEO of consultancy Control Risks, told Bloomberg Television. As companies react to the migrant ban, “perhaps that honeymoon is starting to be over,” he said. The about-face was epitomized by Tesla Motors founder Elon Musk; last week he praised Trump’s nominee for secretary of state, former ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson, as a potentially “excellent” pick. On Sunday, Musk tweeted that migrants “don’t deserve to be rejected” and asked his 6.89 million Twitter followers to read the immigration order and suggest changes. On the other hand, U.S. auto companies, whose home state of Michigan has a large Arab community, have yet to make their views known. Wall Street has also largely stayed out of the fray. At some of its biggest banks, executives said they were struggling to understand whether the order will ultimately apply to employees who work in the U.S. with green cards or legal work permits. If it doesn’t hit visa holders, few major companies’ employees will be affected, according to one executive who asked not to be identified because he wasn’t authorized to comment. On Sunday, JPMorgan said it was working to assist affected staff. Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz said Trump’s move left him with “deep concern, a heavy heart and a resolute promise.” The coffee chain will redouble efforts to hire as many as 10,000 refugees over five years in 75 countries, he wrote in a note to employees Sunday. Reaction was sharpest from the technology industry, with Twitter awash in reminders that Apple’s late co-founder, Steve Jobs, was the son of a Syrian immigrant. Among the first to speak out was Google CEO Sundar Pichai, himself an immigrant from India, who called the policy “painful.” Another India-born CEO, Microsoft’s Satya Nadella, took to LinkedIn to highlight “the positive impact that immigration has on our company, for the country, for the world.” Trump should expect sustained challenges from the tech industry in particular, said Ian Bremmer, CEO of political consultancy Eurasia Group, because it differs significantly with him on issues from net neutrality to immigration. “While most every CEO wants to just ‘get back to business’ after Trump’s election, that’s going to prove much harder” for technology leaders, he said. “There’s going to be a fight.” Compounding business leaders’ unease was the order’s confused implementation, which included unclear directives on how border agents should treat lawful permanent residents, and contradictory statements about how it would affect those who hold passports from two countries — for example, a dual citizen of Iran and the U.K. For now, lawyers are advising such individuals not to travel to the U.S., or to stay put if they already live there. The new rules came into force with no transition period, leaving carriers like Emirates and American Airlines Group Inc. unsure what to do with passengers booked to fly to U.S. airports, or already in the air. “We are committed to protecting our people and will provide whatever support is necessary to protect them and their families,” Michael Roth, CEO of advertising firm Interpublic Group of Cos., wrote in an email. --With assistance from Mary Schlangenstein Christopher Palmeri Gabrielle Coppola Deena Kamel Yousef Eric Pfanner Richard Clough Hugh Son and Dakin Campbell Your next Nation & World articles Starbucks to speed up hiring of vets ami ...

The submission was made in an affidavit placed before Justice Sanjeev Sachdeva by Google which has contended that even if it disables or blocks a site in its search engine, that webpage will remain on the original website and would be accessible on other search engines. This view was also echoed by the court while hearing an NRI’s plea seeking he be “delinked” from information regarding a criminal case involving his wife in which he was not a party. He has also sought removal from the records of the trial court order which mentions him. “If you post something on social media, it will never get deleted,” the court said and added if the man’s plea was allowed then all courts may have to destroy their records in matrimonial disputes. In his petition, filed through advocates Rohit Madan and Zoheb Hussain, the NRI has claimed the online availability of the criminal case, despite it being settled amicably, affects his right to privacy and reputation apart from affecting his employment opportunities. His petition has raised the question “whether data controllers or intermediaries such as Google, are required to delete information that is inadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant if they receive a request for removal of such data”. Claiming that the plea was not maintainable against it or its Indian entity, Google has said, “If a content is adjudicated to be defamatory or its goes beyond the principles of law of privacy, same can be directed to be removed pursuant to being adjudicated by the court. “However, there is no reason or justification for creation of a separate statute or legal framework under right to be forgotten.” Google has also said that the petitioner should have approached the trial court, which had passed the order, to seek confidentiality and non-reporting of the order. The company has contended that the petition is not only “misconceived” but also “legally untenable”. The court, meanwhile, asked the Centre to state its stand on whether such information can be de-linked from the Internet and listed the matter for further hearing on April 24.

It’s also borrowing from the playbook of traditional media companies to create a small circle of power in its top ranks. Using three classes of stock, founders Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy will hold majority voting rights after an initial public offering, according to the company’s prospectus. That sort of control is rare outside the media business or the hottest technology companies. Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy. Photographer: J. Emilio Flores/Corbis via Getty Images The Snapchat app maker intends to go a step further than most newly public companies by selling Class A shares in its IPO with no voting rights. As a result, Spiegel and Murphy can avoid losing power while raising capital. “Snap is doing something I have not seen before: creating and issuing non-voting shares at the IPO,” said Jesse Fried, a professor at Harvard Law School. “After the IPO, Snap can issue additional non-voting stock to employees or other parties without eroding the founders’ control rights.” The use of multiple voting classes has been a common way for media moguls to retain power over their businesses while reducing their financial stakes. Rupert Murdoch uses the strategy at News Corp. and Twenty-First Century Fox Inc., as does the Ochs-Sulzberger family at the New York Times Co. and Sumner Redstone at CBS Corp. and Viacom Inc. These arrangements come with their share of resistance from stockholders. Media barons have said the ownership structure is necessary to protect their companies’ editorial independence or creative freedom, said Paul Gompers, a professor at Harvard Business School. “Outside shareholders understand that the insiders have the ability to call the shots,” he said. Tech companies can thank Google for legitimizing the practice in their industry. To sell the idea to prospective investors, Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin compared their business with newspaper publishers and Wall Street favorite Berkshire Hathaway Inc., which owns several papers. When Google filed to go public in 2004, they acknowledged that dual-class structures were unusual for tech companies but typical among publishers that wanted to focus on the long-term task of “serious news coverage, despite fluctuations in quarterly results,” according to their IPO paperwork. They cited the New York Times, Washington Post and Wall Street Journal publisher Dow Jones, as well as Warren Buffett’s Berkshire. “We want Google to become an important and significant institution,” Page and Brin wrote. “That takes time, stability and independence. We bridge the media and technology industries, both of which have experienced considerable consolidation and attempted hostile takeovers.” Since then, several tech companies have adopted dual-class shares, with mixed results. Under Mark Zuckerberg’s control, Facebook Inc. has weathered several technological upheavals, including the shift from desktop to mobile, and more than tripled its share price. However, some investors still chafe at his unchallenged power. Facebook is currently trying to fend off a shareholder lawsuit, including allegations that board member Marc Andreessen helped advise Zuckerberg at the expense of shareholders. The founders of online coupon site Groupon Inc. and social game maker Zynga Inc. employed dual-class shares to give top executives majority voting control. Each founding CEO was ousted less than two years after their IPOs, and their market values have dropped by more than two-thirds since going public in 2011. Exclusive insights on technology around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology. Sign Up Snap is asking investors for even more faith by introducing a third class of stock. The Class A shares have no votes; the Class B have one vote per share; and the Class C have 10, according to the filing. Spiegel and Murphy own the Class C stock, giving them “the ability to control the outcome of all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval,” the company wrote. That could nix a merger or acquisition of Snap that other shareholders might support and let the founders make other long-term strategy decisions that may not work out, it warned. “To our knowledge, no other company has completed an initial public offering of non-voting stock on a U.S. stock exchange,” Snap wrote. “We cannot predict whether this structure and the concentrated control it affords Mr. Spiegel and Mr. Murphy will result in a lower trading price.” Google, now owned by Alphabet Inc., was sued over the issuance of non-voting stock and later for creating a third class of stock cementing Page and Brin’s voting control for good. It settled both cases. “You’ll continue to see this trend happening until there is something really negative as a result,” said Thomas Ivey, partner at law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom. The money-making side of Snap is fairly young, but it’s increasingly positioning itself to take advertising dollars from media companies. It’s aiming to keep the eyes of its largely millennial audience glued to its app, interspersing ads into video reels and in publishers’ Snapchat content. The company has warned that its financial performance will be “lumpy” as it continues to grow, people familiar with the matter have said. In its IPO filing, Snap reported a 2016 net loss of $515 million, versus a loss of $373 million in 2015. Snap is asking potential investors to trust a couple of twentysomethings to figure out how to capitalize on user engagement, keep growing and eventually reach profitability -- without shareholder intervention.

By: Samden Sherpa Published: Friday, February 3, 2017, 8:00 [IST] Mobile malware is on the rise and your device could be at risk. These tips could help you stay safe and keep your personal information out of the hands of cybercriminals. Well, if you currently analyze the smartphone market then you can see that the adoption rate of mobile devices has skyrocketed and evidently Android is leading the way. The open-source operating system that has been developed by Google is now found on more than half of all smartphones. In fact, according to a report from Strategy Analytics, about nine in 10 smartphones shipped in the latest quarter ran Google's mobile operating system. In addition, Android accounted for a record 87.5% of the 375 million smartphones shipped in the third quarter, ending September 30, 2016. So you can clearly see from the stats that Android continues to dominate the smartphone market. However, because of its popularity and a massive user base, it has now caught the attention of cybercriminals. Currently, Android mobiles are being targeted by virus and malware developers. Moreover, these malware developers are targeting Android mobile devices to accomplish their goals or illegally obtain personal information from Android owners. SEE ALSO: Android 7.1.2 adds swipe for notifications gesture to Nexus 5X and 6P While this is the present scenario in the Android world, with the advancement of mobile technology, mobile malware and viruses are becoming more advanced and thus are infecting millions of mobile worldwide. On the other hand, it is highly recommended that you stick to apps from the official Google Play Store only. If you do you are unlikely to encounter any of the dangerous malware out there. Just to let you know, malware lives and thrives in unofficial app stores, which are largely unregulated. Having said all that, here are the worst malware types you should be aware of and also keep your mobile away. Stay tuned to GizBot for more updates! Ransomware Ransomware is basically a type of malware that encrypts your files and demands a ransom to be paid off to re-gain access back to your files. An example of ransomware would be an app called Simplocker. Simplocker is basically a Trojan malware that disguises itself as an app suitable for adults only. If Simplocker is downloaded and as it enters your smartphone it scans your smartphone's SD card for documents, images and videos. After the scan is complete it encrypts those files using Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). Then it displays a fake FBI message in Russian that accuses the victim of downloading and viewing child pornography on their device. And to get the files back, Simplocker demands some amount to be paid within 24 hrs. It claims that failing to pay the ransom will result in removing all of the files that it has encrypted. However, it has been said that the app doesn't have the functionality to do so. If you are infected with Simplocker, you can download Simplocker Decryptor that was created by ESET. Another type of ransomware which has gained lot notoriety is the "svpeng", which combines ransomware with credit card theft. Svpeng works by presenting a screen to input credit card details every time a user accesses Google Play Store, which then sends the credit card details to the criminal behind this malware. Moreover, once spveng is on your smartphone, it would check to see whether you have a banking app installed. The good news is the Russian police arrested the creator of spveng in April after he stole more than 50 million rubles ($930, 000) and infected more than 350, 000 Android devices. Mobile Shutting Down Android/PowerOffHijack discovered by AVG, is a type of malware that takes control of the process responsible for shutting down your smartphone. With this malware, your phone appears to be off when in fact it's on and functioning. Interestingly, the malware even plays the shutdown animation to show that your device is really turning off. And what this power off hijack really does is it secretly takes pictures, makes calls, and sends messages while you think that your phone is turned off. On the bright side, this type of malware only affects Android versions under 5.0, requires root access and has been found only on apps outside of Google Play Store.

According to experts, "HummingBad" has already attacked more than 10 million Android devices worldwide. Dangerously, this malware has the power to take control of devices; it forces users to click advertisements and download apps by using a multistage attack chain. Moreover, the malware tries to gain access to your device through certain websites and infect it. Once it gets through the device it then tries to gain root access to the device by running software. If it succeeds to get the root access, the attackers will gain full access to your mobile. In case if the malware fails to gain root access, it uses a fake system through which it sends an update notification to your mobile to get system-level permission. Viking Horde This virus can be pretty devastating and harmful for your device. Why we say that is because "Viking Horde" has been created for Google Play Store apps. Through these apps, the virus creates a place in Android devices. Moreover, the virus can infect both rooted and non-rooted devices. So, whenever a user downloads an infected app from Google Play Store, the device gets infected by the malware. The risks of rooted devices are bigger compared to non-rooted devices. In rooted devices, "Viking Horde" installs software and executes code remotely to get access to the mobile data. If it does, then the data of your mobile is at risk. The reason behind launching this app is for conducting ad clicks, spam messages, and others.

And with the existence of such sites these attackers are stealing users' credentials or worse. The fact that mobile devices come with smaller screen is making malicious phishing techniques easier to hide from users. As such it is less sophisticated on mobile devices than PCs. Moreover, phishing schemes use rogue mobile apps, programs which can be considered "trojanized", while hiding their true intent as a system update, marketing offer or game. Some of these malware infect legitimate apps also with malicious code which can be only discovered after installing. Malware Symptoms Having looked at the different types of mobile malware, you might have an idea on how they spread and infect devices. While the do come in various ways, they all can produce similar symptoms. Well, signs of a malware infection can include unwanted behaviors and degradation of device performance. Stability issues such as frozen apps, failure to reboot and difficulty connecting to the network are also common. In addition, mobile malware can drain your battery or processing power, hijack the browser, send unauthorized SMS messages, freeze or spoil the device entirely. SEE ALSO: Google rolls out Android Nougat 7.1.2 Developer Preview for Pixel and Nexus phones How to be Safe? So if you are wondering how you can avoid and be safe from such malware then there are several best practices that all mobile users should follow to prevent Android malware infections. In essence, some malware cases may require special prevention and treatment methods, but following these recommendations will greatly increase a user's protection from a wide range of mobile malware. #1 Download apps only from official app stores like Apple's App Store or Google Play. The vast majority of malicious apps are found on unofficial app stores or websites, many based in China or Russia. #2 Do some research on the developer and their reputation. Read user ratings, paying special attention to reviews from disgruntled users, and seek out app recommendations from reputable sources. #3 Think twice before granting "permissions" when installing new apps for the first time. Often, malicious app developers are counting on that level of carelessness to sneak malware onto your device. Always make sure to carefully read the end user agreement before clicking to understand exactly what permissions the app is asking for. Stay tuned to GizBot for more updates!

REUTERS/Lucas Jackson/File Photo Enlarge Caption  Email More A A REUTERS: Snapchat owner Snap Inc shot the opening salvo in its US$3 billion initial public offering on Thursday, outlining aggressive expansion plans but offering new investors no say on how the company is run and no promise of profits. Snap's publication on Thursday of its IPO registration document sets the stage for its upcoming marketing campaign to convince investors to look past its widening losses and the firm grip of its founders, and focus on its rapid growth of active users. The number of Snap's daily active users grew to an average of 158 million at the end of December, up 48 percent year-on-year, Snap revealed. However, its net loss widened to US$514.6 million in 2016 from US$372.9 million the year before. While Snap will have time to polish its marketing pitch in the run-up to the IPO planned for March, some analysts were taken aback that the company was just beginning to reap cash from its product. "What surprises me the most is that it is still very early days when it comes to Snap making money," said Rohit Kulkarni, managing director at private securities investment firm SharesPost. Snap had confidentially registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for an IPO late last year. It kept the filing under such tight wraps, even some of its IPO underwriters had not seen it prior to publication on Thursday, sources familiar with the matter previously told Reuters. Snap said in the IPO registration document published on Thursday it would become the first U.S. company to go public with shares on offer not granting voting rights to stock market investors. Its founders, Evan Spiegel and Robert Murphy, will keep control of the company. Snap could be valued at between US$20 billion to US$25 billion, according to sources familiar with the situation who asked not to be named because the matter is confidential. That would give the company the richest valuation in a U.S. technology IPO since Facebook Inc. Snap, which launched itself in 2012 with an app that sends disappearing messages, rebranded itself last year as a camera company and started selling US$130 video camera glasses. It generates the majority of its revenue from advertising, seeking to challenge the dominance of internet giants such as Facebook and Alphabet Inc's Google. "The industry has been crying out for new advertising units" says Ian Schafer, founder and chairman of ad agency Deep Focus, referring to the tight hold Facebook and Google have on the digital advertising marketplace. In its IPO registration document, Snap cited Apple Inc, Google, Twitter Inc, Facebook and its photo-sharing platform Instagram as its competitors. TIGHT CONTROL Spiegel, the 26-year-old Snap co-founder, last year earned US$503,205 in salary, with a US$1 million bonus. Imran Khan, Snapchat's chief strategy officer whom it hired from investment bank Credit Suisse Group AG in 2014, earned US$241,539 last year with a US$5.2 million bonus. In 2015, Khan also received US$145.3 million worth of Snap shares as a sign-up bonus. Spiegel and Murphy will maintain tight control over Snap's stock through a unique three-share class structure. The structure will give Spiegel and Murphy the right of 10 votes for every share. Existing investors will have one vote for each of their shares, while new investors will have no voting rights. Snap said it couldn't predict if the structure would "result in a lower trading price or greater fluctuations" in the stock. Keeping tight control is common in companies closely associated with their founders, who often prefer to grow their business without being questioned by a broad array of investors. Still, offering a class of stock with no votes in an IPO is unprecedented. Though the structure has drawn some criticism for not giving stock market investors the opportunity to have input, some people close to the company have argued that investors can "vote with their feet" by not buying into the IPO if they are not comfortable with the arrangements. "Investors have to decide, am I going to avail myself of the opportunity to buy the stock, and forget about the fact that somewhere down the road they are likely going to run into trouble?" said James McRitchie, an independent corporate governance activist who has pressed for more equal voting rights at companies including Facebook. PAYING GOOGLE Snap had US$404.5 million in sales in 2016, up from US$58.7 million in 2015. However, it had adjusted losses before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization last year of US$459 million, compared with US$292.9 million in 2015. Snap's biggest losses stem from "hosting fees" which it pays to cloud computing companies such as Google to use their infrastructure for its data. It will pay Google US$2 billion over the next five years to use its cloud computing services. Because Snapchat users rely heavily on data-heavy pictures and video, the cost of these service is high. Still, the proportion of the company's costs to its revenue has been declining. Its strategy has been to bargain for better hosting rates as its growing number of users buoys its negotiating leverage. "They are adding infrastructure ahead of growth, and that is why you have some front-loading of losses," said SharesPost's Kulkarni. Some companies such as Facebook have their own hosting platforms, though this model can be more costly. Facebook's Instagram, which recently introduced disappearing video content similar to Snapchat, had 600 million users as of late last year. Like Snapchat, Instagram sells advertising on its platform. Snap's aggressive expansion is reflected in its staff numbers. By the end of last year, it had increased its number of employees to 1,859 from 600 in 2015. Snap said it would use the proceeds from its IPO for general purposes, including working capital, operating expenses and capital expenditures. Snap said it will list on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker SNAP. Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs Group Inc, JPMorgan Chase & Co and Deutsche Bank AG are leading the offering as underwriters.

The tech giant is creating a $2 million crisis fund for immigrant causes, which can be matched by up to $2 million from Google employees, potentially amounting to $4 million in donations that would benefit four organizations. Sundar Pichai, Google's chief executive, detailed the fund in a memo sent out to all staff on Sunday, reported USA Today. A Google spokeswoman confirmed the report Monday morning. The fund's creation follows Pichai's criticism of President Donald Trump's immigration order, issued Friday. The executive order puts in place a temporary ban on entry into the US by citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries as a deterrent to potential acts of terrorism. It created uncertainty at many airports over the weekend as federal agencies worked to interpret the requirements and sparked widespread protests across the US by people who saw the move as excessive and "un-American." The immigration order has garnered strongly worded criticism from across the tech industry, with Apple, Microsoft, Twitter, Facebook and many others joining the chorus of voices condemning Trump's decision. The fund will be Google's largest crisis campaign ever. It would provide funds to the American Civil Liberties Union, Immigrant Legal Resource Center, International Rescue Committee and UNHCR. Google also encouraged more than 100 employees to return from traveling overseas immediately for fear they would not be allowed back into the US.

Instead, Korematsu, like 115,000 other people of Japanese descent living in the US, was ordered to an internment camp per an executive order signed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Korematsu refused to hand himself and instead went into hiding. He was arrested in 1942 and sent to Central Utah War Relocation Center until the war ended in 1945. The timing of the doodle doesn't seem to be a coincidence. On Sunday, Google announced that it's launching a crisis fund to help immigrant causes in the wake of Donald Trump's immigration order, which bans citizens of seven Muslim countries from entering the US for 90 days. The order, issued Friday, also bans refugees from entering the country for 120 days and places a permanent ban on refugees from Syria. Sundar Pichai, Google's CEO, has been openly critical of Trump's executive order. One of the organizations its immigration fund is set to benefit is the American Civil Liberties Union, which in the 1940s fought to prevent Korematsu from being incarcerated. Plenty of people had thoughts on the doodle's subject and timing. President Gerald Ford officially overturned and apologized for the order that affected Korematsu in 1976, and his conviction was also finally overturned, but not until 1983. In 1998 President Bill Clinton awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom for his contribution to fighting for civil rights. Clicking through from the doodle pulls up a quote from Korematsu. "If you have the feeling that something is wrong, don't be afraid to speak up," it says. Tech Enabled: CNET chronicles tech's role in providing new kinds of accessibility.

According to Re/code, the tech giants are reaching out to other tech companies, including Uber and Stripe, as well as companies outside of the tech space. BREAKING: Big tech giants like Google, Apple, Microsoft and Facebook along with CPG, manufacturing cos working on letter opposing Trump ban — Kara Swisher (@karaswisher) February 2, 2017 Tone and Approach Re/code published a draft of a letter the companies plan to send the White House. That draft directly makes the case that America was built on immigration. It indirectly makes the case that the rule of law and predictability is important to business. It also strikes a markedly conciliatory tone, making much of changes to the initial executive order forced by courts. The companies also make repeated offers to work with the White House to find better ways of achieving the stated goals of the Trump administration. Social media reaction to the news has been mixed. Many have praised the companies for taking a stand, while others have criticized the letter as inadequate. @karaswisher @mumper A letter you say? I sure hope it’s a sharply worded correspondence. — Rod Von Hugendong (@Oxpocket) February 2, 2017 Supporters of Donald Trump have, naturally, criticized and attacked the companies (and Re/code) in any number of ways. Corporate Action Executives at all the above-listed companies have criticized the executive order. Apple CEO Tim Cook told The Wall Street Journal on Tuesday that his company was weighing its legal options. It’s possible—perhaps even likely—that this letter is the first public-facing action of a coalition. The tech giants want business response to be broad and comprehensive. It’s one thing for the White House to dismiss Silicon Valley response as a product of an irrelevant Left Coast. It’s another for companies from all over America to be part of the message. But…the tech world is leading this for a reason. Being left of center isn’t a big risk in Silicon Valley, but there are obviously many parts of the country where it is, regardless of the business case to be made against the executive order. With that in mind, getting companies to sign off on a mealy-mouthed letter is a far easier first step than getting them to sign on to, say, a lawsuit. Text of the Draft, from Re/Code Dear President Trump, Since the country’s birth, America has been the land of opportunity — welcoming newcomers and giving them the chance to build families, careers and businesses in the United States. We are a nation made stronger by immigrants. As entrepreneurs and business leaders, our ability to grow our companies and create jobs depends on the contributions of immigrants from all backgrounds. We share your goal of ensuring that our immigration system meets today’s security needs and keeps our country safe. We are concerned, however, that your recent executive order will affect many visa holders who work hard here in the United States and contribute to our country’s success. In a global economy, it is critical that we continue to attract the best and brightest from around the world. We welcome the changes your administration has made in recent days in how the Department of Homeland Security will implement the executive order, and we stand ready to help your administration identify other opportunities to ensure that our employees can travel with predictability and without undue delay. Our nation’s compassion is a part of what makes it exceptional, and we are committed to helping your administration identify approaches for thorough screening without a blanket suspension of admissions under the U.S. Refugee Admissions program. While security and vetting procedures can and should always be subject to continuous evaluation and improvement, a blanket suspension is not the right approach. Similarly, we stand ready to identify ways of helping to achieve your stated goal of bringing clarity to the future of the 750,000 Dreamers in this country under the protections of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program in a way “that will make people happy and proud.” Removing these protections by barring renewals would effectively end the program and eliminate the ability for these Dreamers to work and live without the fear of deportation. The business community shares your commitment to growing the American economy and expanding job creation across the country. We hire both thousands of Americans and some of the most talented people from abroad, who work together to help our companies succeed and expand our overall employment. As you contemplate changes to the nation’s complex and interconnected immigration policies, whether business and employment-based visas, refugees or DACA, we hope that you will use us as a resource to help achieve immigration policies that both support the work of American businesses and reflect American values.

  Home U.K. News Sports U.S. Showbiz Australia Femail Health Science Money Video Travel Columnists Wires Home My Profile Logout Login Feedback DailyMail NEW ARTICLESHomeTop Share show ad Snap shoots for the sky, promises little in $3 bln IPO pitch By Reuters Published: 21:31 EST, 2 February 2017 | Updated: 21:31 EST, 2 February 2017 e-mail By Lauren Hirsch and Liana B. Baker Feb 2 (Reuters) - Snapchat owner Snap Inc shot the opening salvo in its $3 billion initial public offering on Thursday, outlining aggressive expansion plans but offering new investors no say on how the company is run and no promise of profits. Snap's publication on Thursday of its IPO registration document sets the stage for its upcoming marketing campaign to convince investors to look past its widening losses and the firm grip of its founders, and focus on its rapid growth of active users. The number of Snap's daily active users grew to an average of 158 million at the end of December, up 48 percent year-on-year, Snap revealed. However, its net loss widened to $514.6 million in 2016 from $372.9 million the year before. While Snap will have time to polish its marketing pitch in the run-up to the IPO planned for March, some analysts were taken aback that the company was just beginning to reap cash from its product. "What surprises me the most is that it is still very early days when it comes to Snap making money," said Rohit Kulkarni, managing director at private securities investment firm SharesPost. Snap had confidentially registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for an IPO late last year. It kept the filing under such tight wraps, even some of its IPO underwriters had not seen it prior to publication on Thursday, sources familiar with the matter previously told Reuters. Snap said in the IPO registration document published on Thursday it would become the first U.S. company to go public with shares on offer not granting voting rights to stock market investors. Its founders, Evan Spiegel and Robert Murphy, will keep control of the company. Snap could be valued at between $20 billion to $25 billion, according to sources familiar with the situation who asked not to be named because the matter is confidential. That would give the company the richest valuation in a U.S. technology IPO since Facebook Inc. Snap, which launched itself in 2012 with an app that sends disappearing messages, rebranded itself last year as a camera company and started selling $130 video camera glasses. It generates the majority of its revenue from advertising, seeking to challenge the dominance of internet giants such as Facebook and Alphabet Inc's Google. "The industry has been crying out for new advertising units" says Ian Schafer, founder and chairman of ad agency Deep Focus, referring to the tight hold Facebook and Google have on the digital advertising marketplace. In its IPO registration document, Snap cited Apple Inc , Google, Twitter Inc, Facebook and its photo-sharing platform Instagram as its competitors. TIGHT CONTROL Spiegel, the 26-year-old Snap co-founder, last year earned $503,205 in salary, with a $1 million bonus. Imran Khan, Snapchat's chief strategy officer whom it hired from investment bank Credit Suisse Group AG in 2014, earned $241,539 last year with a $5.2 million bonus. In 2015, Khan also received $145.3 million worth of Snap shares as a sign-up bonus. Spiegel and Murphy will maintain tight control over Snap's stock through a unique three-share class structure. The structure will give Spiegel and Murphy the right of 10 votes for every share. Existing investors will have one vote for each of their shares, while new investors will have no voting rights. Snap said it couldn't predict if the structure would "result in a lower trading price or greater fluctuations" in the stock. Keeping tight control is common in companies closely associated with their founders, who often prefer to grow their business without being questioned by a broad array of investors. Still, offering a class of stock with no votes in an IPO is unprecedented. Though the structure has drawn some criticism for not giving stock market investors the opportunity to have input, some people close to the company have argued that investors can "vote with their feet" by not buying into the IPO if they are not comfortable with the arrangements. "Investors have to decide, am I going to avail myself of the opportunity to buy the stock, and forget about the fact that somewhere down the road they are likely going to run into trouble?" said James McRitchie, an independent corporate governance activist who has pressed for more equal voting rights at companies including Facebook. PAYING GOOGLE Snap had $404.5 million in sales in 2016, up from $58.7 million in 2015. However, it had adjusted losses before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization last year of $459 million, compared with $292.9 million in 2015. Snap's biggest losses stem from "hosting fees" which it pays to cloud computing companies such as Google to use their infrastructure for its data. It will pay Google $2 billion over the next five years to use its cloud computing services. Because Snapchat users rely heavily on data-heavy pictures and video, the cost of these service is high. Still, the proportion of the company's costs to its revenue has been declining. Its strategy has been to bargain for better hosting rates as its growing number of users buoys its negotiating leverage. "They are adding infrastructure ahead of growth, and that is why you have some front-loading of losses," said SharesPost's Kulkarni. Some companies such as Facebook have their own hosting platforms, though this model can be more costly. Facebook's Instagram, which recently introduced disappearing video content similar to Snapchat, had 600 million users as of late last year. Like Snapchat, Instagram sells advertising on its platform. Snap's aggressive expansion is reflected in its staff numbers. By the end of last year, it had increased its number of employees to 1,859 from 600 in 2015. Snap said it would use the proceeds from its IPO for general purposes, including working capital, operating expenses and capital expenditures. Snap said it will list on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker SNAP. Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs Group Inc , JPMorgan Chase & Co and Deutsche Bank AG are leading the offering as underwriters.

By: Samden Sherpa Published: Friday, February 3, 2017, 8:00 [IST] Mobile malware is on the rise and your device could be at risk. These tips could help you stay safe and keep your personal information out of the hands of cybercriminals. Well, if you currently analyze the smartphone market then you can see that the adoption rate of mobile devices has skyrocketed and evidently Android is leading the way. The open-source operating system that has been developed by Google is now found on more than half of all smartphones. In fact, according to a report from Strategy Analytics, about nine in 10 smartphones shipped in the latest quarter ran Google's mobile operating system. In addition, Android accounted for a record 87.5% of the 375 million smartphones shipped in the third quarter, ending September 30, 2016. So you can clearly see from the stats that Android continues to dominate the smartphone market. However, because of its popularity and a massive user base, it has now caught the attention of cybercriminals. Currently, Android mobiles are being targeted by virus and malware developers. Moreover, these malware developers are targeting Android mobile devices to accomplish their goals or illegally obtain personal information from Android owners. SEE ALSO: Android 7.1.2 adds swipe for notifications gesture to Nexus 5X and 6P While this is the present scenario in the Android world, with the advancement of mobile technology, mobile malware and viruses are becoming more advanced and thus are infecting millions of mobile worldwide. On the other hand, it is highly recommended that you stick to apps from the official Google Play Store only. If you do you are unlikely to encounter any of the dangerous malware out there. Just to let you know, malware lives and thrives in unofficial app stores, which are largely unregulated. Having said all that, here are the worst malware types you should be aware of and also keep your mobile away. Stay tuned to GizBot for more updates! Ransomware Ransomware is basically a type of malware that encrypts your files and demands a ransom to be paid off to re-gain access back to your files. An example of ransomware would be an app called Simplocker. Simplocker is basically a Trojan malware that disguises itself as an app suitable for adults only. If Simplocker is downloaded and as it enters your smartphone it scans your smartphone's SD card for documents, images and videos. After the scan is complete it encrypts those files using Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). Then it displays a fake FBI message in Russian that accuses the victim of downloading and viewing child pornography on their device. And to get the files back, Simplocker demands some amount to be paid within 24 hrs. It claims that failing to pay the ransom will result in removing all of the files that it has encrypted. However, it has been said that the app doesn't have the functionality to do so. If you are infected with Simplocker, you can download Simplocker Decryptor that was created by ESET. Another type of ransomware which has gained lot notoriety is the "svpeng", which combines ransomware with credit card theft. Svpeng works by presenting a screen to input credit card details every time a user accesses Google Play Store, which then sends the credit card details to the criminal behind this malware. Moreover, once spveng is on your smartphone, it would check to see whether you have a banking app installed. The good news is the Russian police arrested the creator of spveng in April after he stole more than 50 million rubles ($930, 000) and infected more than 350, 000 Android devices. Mobile Shutting Down Android/PowerOffHijack discovered by AVG, is a type of malware that takes control of the process responsible for shutting down your smartphone. With this malware, your phone appears to be off when in fact it's on and functioning. Interestingly, the malware even plays the shutdown animation to show that your device is really turning off. And what this power off hijack really does is it secretly takes pictures, makes calls, and sends messages while you think that your phone is turned off. On the bright side, this type of malware only affects Android versions under 5.0, requires root access and has been found only on apps outside of Google Play Store.

According to experts, "HummingBad" has already attacked more than 10 million Android devices worldwide. Dangerously, this malware has the power to take control of devices; it forces users to click advertisements and download apps by using a multistage attack chain. Moreover, the malware tries to gain access to your device through certain websites and infect it. Once it gets through the device it then tries to gain root access to the device by running software. If it succeeds to get the root access, the attackers will gain full access to your mobile. In case if the malware fails to gain root access, it uses a fake system through which it sends an update notification to your mobile to get system-level permission. Viking Horde This virus can be pretty devastating and harmful for your device. Why we say that is because "Viking Horde" has been created for Google Play Store apps. Through these apps, the virus creates a place in Android devices. Moreover, the virus can infect both rooted and non-rooted devices. So, whenever a user downloads an infected app from Google Play Store, the device gets infected by the malware. The risks of rooted devices are bigger compared to non-rooted devices. In rooted devices, "Viking Horde" installs software and executes code remotely to get access to the mobile data. If it does, then the data of your mobile is at risk. The reason behind launching this app is for conducting ad clicks, spam messages, and others. SEE ALSO: Google Nexus 6 and Nexus 9 will not get Android Nougat 7.1.2 update Phishing Apps While mobile browsing of the internet is growing with smartphone and tablet penetration, fraudsters and cyber criminals are now creating mobile phishing sites that look similar to a legitimate service. And with the existence of such sites these attackers are stealing users' credentials or worse. The fact that mobile devices come with smaller screen is making malicious phishing techniques easier to hide from users. As such it is less sophisticated on mobile devices than PCs. Moreover, phishing schemes use rogue mobile apps, programs which can be considered "trojanized", while hiding their true intent as a system update, marketing offer or game. Some of these malware infect legitimate apps also with malicious code which can be only discovered after installing. Malware Symptoms Having looked at the different types of mobile malware, you might have an idea on how they spread and infect devices. While the do come in various ways, they all can produce similar symptoms. Well, signs of a malware infection can include unwanted behaviors and degradation of device performance. Stability issues such as frozen apps, failure to reboot and difficulty connecting to the network are also common. In addition, mobile malware can drain your battery or processing power, hijack the browser, send unauthorized SMS messages, freeze or spoil the device entirely. SEE ALSO: Google rolls out Android Nougat 7.1.2 Developer Preview for Pixel and Nexus phones How to be Safe? So if you are wondering how you can avoid and be safe from such malware then there are several best practices that all mobile users should follow to prevent Android malware infections. In essence, some malware cases may require special prevention and treatment methods, but following these recommendations will greatly increase a user's protection from a wide range of mobile malware. #1 Download apps only from official app stores like Apple's App Store or Google Play. The vast majority of malicious apps are found on unofficial app stores or websites, many based in China or Russia. #2 Do some research on the developer and their reputation. Read user ratings, paying special attention to reviews from disgruntled users, and seek out app recommendations from reputable sources. #3 Think twice before granting "permissions" when installing new apps for the first time. Often, malicious app developers are counting on that level of carelessness to sneak malware onto your device. Always make sure to carefully read the end user agreement before clicking to understand exactly what permissions the app is asking for. Stay tuned to GizBot for more updates!

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars Follow us on social: CLOUD One thing holding back Snap in China? Google Jordan Novet@jordannovet February 2, 2017 6:34 PM Tags: Alphabet, Google, infrastructure as a service, public cloud, Snap, Snap IPO, Snapchat Above: Google signage Image Credit: Ken Yeung/VentureBeat An interesting cloud story is tucked inside Snap Inc.’s S-1 filing for an initial public offering (IPO). It turns out that Google, considered the No. 3 player in the public cloud infrastructure market, has a hefty $5 billion deal with the company behind messaging app Snapchat. According to the terms of the deal, Snapchat must spend $400 million on the Google Cloud each year beginning on January 30, 2017, and if that doesn’t happen, for each of the first four years, as much as 15 percent of the $400 million can be rolled over to the following year. Assuming that Snap will do the full $400 million each year, that works out to more than $33 million per month — a huge cloud spend. For some context, public cloud market leader Amazon Web Services (AWS) last year succeeded in getting Salesforce to agree to spend $400 million over four years. It’s not as if Snapchat is new addition to Google’s servers. The app has been hosted on Google infrastructure for four years or more; nowadays the “vast majority” of Snapchat runs on Google, according to today’s filing. The thing is, while Google has been opening up new data centers around the world for its public cloud, it doesn’t currently have the geographical reach that other clouds do. To narrow down the focus to one country, it does not have a footprint in China. AWS does, and so does Microsoft Azure. Both rely on partners based in China (Sinnet and 21Vianet, respectively) to operate their data center infrastructure in the country. But more generally, Google pulled out of mainland China in 2010 as a result of censorship issues. “Access to Google, which currently powers our infrastructure, is restricted in China, and we do not know if we will be able to enter the market in a manner acceptable to the Chinese government,” Snap said in the filing. Plus, Snap only recently opened an office in China. “We have very limited access to the China market, as we have not yet established an operating presence in China to support Snapchat,” Snap said in the filing. China is important because it’s a place where there’s lots of advertising spend — second only to the U.S., according to the IDC data Snap included in its filing — and that’s important because Snap’s primary revenue stream is from ads. So it’s probably safe to say Google not being there is at least an inconvenience. Because of the contract Snap signed with Google, which comes with discounts but does allow for a reduction in payment in the event of “a significant revenue decline,” it’s not really in a position to very easily transfer to another cloud or hosting provider. “Any transition of such services to another cloud provider would be difficult to implement, and may cause us to incur significant time and expense,” Snap said in the filing. But that isn’t to say Snap isn’t being smart and preparing for a future without Google. “We are currently negotiating an agreement with another cloud provider for redundant infrastructure support of our business operations. In the future, we may invest in building our own infrastructure to better serve our customers,” Snap said.* That’s not unheard of. Dropbox switched off AWS and onto its own infrastructure. But it is, I would guess, a few years away. Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment. *It’s got to be either AWS or Azure. If you know, tell me!

Tsering Topgyal The Associated Press i By the Editorial Board There is surely no shortage of U.S. workers in Silicon Valley. But if President Donald Trump wants to get more Americans hired in tech, the solution isn’t to threaten work visas or to ban travel by immigrants and refugees. He should tackle the problem at its source – in American public high schools, where math, science and technology education lags that of other nations. The problem isn’t that employers won’t “hire American,” as Trump puts it. It’s that too many American students, disproportionately students of color, aren’t being adequately prepared. Trump has been fragging America’s tech sector in what can only be described as an act of epic stupidity, economically speaking. His executive order last weekend to restrict visas and refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries sowed international fear and chaos, and struck at the secret weapon that gives U.S. tech its edge – the ability to freely recruit and retain top talent internationally. Immigrants are inextricably bound up with the success of tech in this country. Elon Musk came from South Africa to build Tesla, SpaceX and PayPal. Pierre Omidyar of eBay was born in Paris to Iranian parents. Yahoo founder Jerry Yang came from Taiwan at age 12 knowing one word of English. Apple’s Steve Jobs was the son of a Syrian refugee. But as if throwing huge employers such as Google, Amazon and Microsoft into turmoil weren’t sufficient, the administration said this week it is drafting another executive order aimed at severely limiting visas for foreign workers. The H-1B skilled visas most commonly requested in tech do need some tweaks, in part to stop offshore outsourcing firms from undercutting U.S. workers, but there’s no earthly reason that shouldn’t be done the normal way, by Congress. Trump’s edicts – one already in force, the other, for now, only under discussion – have been denounced by tech executives in California and across the country, and for good moral and financial reasons. Google’s co-founder Sergey Brin, a former Soviet refugee, joined demonstrators at San Francisco International Airport. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos said his company was exploring its own legal challenges, and joined Microsoft and Expedia in support of a Washington state lawsuit. Travis Kalanick, the head of Uber, quit Trump’s business council this week amid threats of boycott. Several top executives are circulating an open letter asking Trump to work reasonably with them on this issue. But reason doesn’t seem to be driving policy in this administration. Last weekend’s train wreck of an order was said to have been the brainchild of two of Trump’s most ideologically rigid lieutenants – Steve Bannon, a self-described “nationalist” and former head of the alt-right platform Breitbart, and Stephen Miller, a former aide to Trump’s attorney general nominee, Jeff Sessions. Bannon has told audiences he believes the “Judeo-Christian West” is preparing for a war with Muslims, and has complained that American “civic society” is being overrun by Asian CEOs and immigrant tech workers. Miller’s speeches and writings are riddled with similar crackpottery. Such bigotry has no place in U.S. policy, let alone the hiring practices in one of the nation’s biggest job engines. But even if their motives weren’t suspect, cutting off foreign visas won’t make engineers out of Rust Belt dropouts. At last count, the U.S. was projected to have 1.3 million unfilled tech jobs over the next five years. One analysis of Bureau of Labor Statistics numbers reported more than 209,000 unfilled jobs in cybersecurity. The reason? Not enough skilled U.S. workers to adequately fill them, not even in California. So few high school students understand computer science here, in fact, that last year Gov. Jerry Brown signed a law to address the problem. Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom is still struggling to get computer science included in the core high school curriculum for University of California admissions. The obvious solution, of course, would be to support public schools with federal money – an irony, given the private school zealot who is Trump’s pick for education secretary. So tech executives should speak up, to the extent they can without risking mean Trump tweets that tank their stock prices. Meanwhile, Trump might need another wall, just to keep Silicon Valley in Silicon Valley. The friendly Canadian business climate is the talk of the tech sector, suddenly.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it (Reuters) By Elizabeth Dwoskin and Craig Timberg By Elizabeth Dwoskin and Craig Timberg February 2 at 8:02 PM Follow @lizzadwoskin Follow @craigtimberg SAN FRANCISCO — The tech industry’s opposition to President Trump escalated Thursday as corporate leaders drafted a letter warning of the economic risks of his immigration policies, Uber’s chief executive quit an administration advisory board and Lyft pulled its ads from Breitbart News, the site founded by the White House chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon. The developments followed remarks this week from Apple, Amazon and other companies, which said they were exploring legal action against Trump’s executive order that temporarily barred travelers from seven majority-Muslim countries. Amazon and Expedia also joined a lawsuit brought by the state of Washington against the immigration ban. The actions underscored rising alarm along the West Coast’s tech archipelago from Silicon Valley to Seattle that Trump’s policies threaten a sector that has long been a driver of new wealth and innovation in an otherwise tepid economy. After attempting to reach out to Trump by attending a meeting at his hotel in New York, tech companies are preparing themselves for a high-stakes confrontation with the president. Trump’s quest to tighten immigration has struck particularly hard at left-leaning Silicon Valley, which relies on a flow of high-level talent from India, east Asia and elsewhere and sees diversity as core to its identity as an innovation hub. People shout slogans at the protest. (Kate Munsch/Reuters) “People come to Silicon Valley so they can build the American Dream, and this is one of the last places where the American Dream still kind of works,” said Jonathan Nelson, chief executive of Hackers/Founders, a 300,000-person global network of entrepreneurs and engineers. “If this happens, you’re going to completely kill the next 10 years of tech companies.” Some tech companies are now considering whether to move jobs out of the United States to places with more relaxed immigration policies, such as Vancouver, B.C., and Dublin, which have made clear they would welcome an influx of U.S.-based immigrant technology workers. “One of the sad ironies of this is that an administration that purports to understand business is threatening one of the core pillars of what has made Silicon Valley so successful and an engine of economic growth,” said Matt Mahan, chief executive of the social networking start-up Brigade. Tensions have been building since Friday night, when tech executives, including Apple’s Tim Cook and Google’s Sundar Pichai, began publicly denouncing the immigration ban. Protesters flooded U.S. airports and held rallies outside Google’s offices. In a flurry of emails and late-night phone calls among top executives, the industry began preparing a range of responses. A little more than half of U.S. start-ups that are estimated to be worth more than $1 billion were founded by immigrants, according to the National Foundation for American Policy, an Arlington think tank. And Silicon Valley is littered with immigrant success stories: Satya Nadella, the chief executive of Microsoft, is an immigrant from India; Google co-founder Sergey Brin is a refugee from the former Soviet Union; and Omid Kordestani, Twitter’s executive chairman, was born in Iran. Apple co-founder Steve Jobs was the son of a Syrian immigrant, leading Cook to say, in a letter denouncing Trump’s travel ban, that the company “wouldn’t exist” if such a ban had been in place. Sam Altman, the president of Silicon Valley’s Y Combinator, called the reaction to the immigration ban a watershed moment in which the tech industry — rivals and all — made the unusual move of coming together and drawing a line in the sand against a sitting president. (Jhaan Elker/The Washington Post) The steps taken by tech companies become more urgent after a draft of what appeared to be a Trump administration executive order limiting workers on H-1B visas circulated widely in Silicon Valley this week. The leaked order indicated the administration could cancel the annual lottery through which technology companies sponsor tens of thousands of engineers, as well as a special visa for start-up founders who want to move to the United States. A spokesman for the White House declined to comment on the leaked order or confirm its veracity. But White House press secretary Sean Spicer told reporters this week that the administration expects to scrutinize work visa programs closely as part of its immigration agenda. “There’s an overall need to look at all of these programs,” said Spicer. “And you’ll see both through executive action and through comprehensive measures a way to address immigration as a whole and the visa program.” As tensions built throughout the week, Uber chief executive Travis Kalanick and Tesla’s Elon Musk, who serve on Trump’s economic council, faced intense pressure to disavow their work with the administration, according to people familiar with the situation. Both have insisted, until now, that being at the table, and having the opportunity to influence the direction of the country, was better than not being at it. But on Thursday, Kalanick said that he had spoken with Trump and told him that he would step down. Musk declined requests for comment. Kalanick’s calculus changed after the company faced a huge outcry from the public for not joining Saturday’s protests at airports. In his letter, Kalanick said he made his decision after hearing the stories of Uber employees and drivers, in particular those of Emil Michael, a refugee from Egypt, and Thuan Pham, a refugee from Vietnam. Kalanick wrote that the executive order was hurting people across America and hurting Uber’s ability to make positive change in the country. “The implicit assumption that Uber (or I) was somehow endorsing the Administration’s agenda has created a perception-reality gap between who people think we are, and who we actually are,” he wrote. “There are many ways we will continue to advocate for just change on immigration but staying on the council was going to get in the way of that.” In separate letter, more than 115 Silicon Valley start-up founders and venture capitalists pleaded with the administration to cancel the immigration ban. “Silicon Valley flourishes because of our free and open culture of entrepreneurship and excellence,” they wrote. “The President’s actions yesterday not only negatively affect Tech’s competitiveness, they hurt the U.S. economy overall.” Another letter from executives at Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Apple and others is also being drafted, according to a person familiar with the deliberations who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the private matter. In interviews, technology company officials said they were looking into relocating people to overseas offices in Ireland and other places in Europe. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because the deliberations were still underway. “Tech companies are telling me they would rather set up subsidiaries or set up their companies in countries that are more welcoming and have friendlier immigration laws,” said Priya Alagiri, an immigration lawyer based in San Francisco who represents start-ups and tech firms. “They go to great lengths [to keep immigrant workers] because the workers are so highly talented and highly skilled.” Meanwhile, Lyft, Uber’s ride-hailing rival, said Thursday that it was pulling ads from Breitbart News, following the actions of hundreds of other companies, including Lenovo, HP and T-Mobile. Many of the firms criticized the site as being an anti-immigrant and racist platform. “One of Lyft’s core values is to uplift and support one another in all that we do,” said Adrian Durbin, Lyft’s director of communications. “We strive to ensure that our advertisements appear only on sites that share this value.” Timberg reported from Washington.

Flock, a new messaging and collaboration platform with users in some 25,000 global organizations, has announced the immediate availability of the Flock Fake News Detector. This first-of-its-kind feature empowers Flock users to stop false and misleading information from being introduced into their messaging/collaboration environments and decision-making processes. "It became imperative and important for us, and even more so for us in an organizational context, that we are able to flag and provide information to both senders and recipients on the veracity and accuracy of the news and the links that they post," Flock CEO Bhavin Turakhia told eWEEK. Google's efforts to convince potential business customers about the enterprise readiness of its cloud services continued this week, this time with a focus on security. The company on Tuesday announced what it described as new enterprise-grade controls for its range of G Suite applications that include business email, calendar, spreadsheet, storage and other applications. At a high level, the new features are designed to provide G Suite administrators with more powerful access control and data loss prevention capabilities. With this week’s update, Google has also connected its BigQuery data analytics engine to Gmail making it easier for administrators to conduct analytics and gain insight from security data. The widely-used Dridex banking trojan has been modified by attackers to bypass a fundamental protection on Windows that lets users block the installation of potentially malicious programs, according to security firm Flashpoint. The modification, which first appeared on Jan. 25, allows the program to silently execute on systems where the user is part of an administrative group, according to Vitali Kremez, senior cyber-crime intelligence analyst at Flashpoint, a threat intelligence firm. The attack by itself does not escalate privileges and so may not work on limited user accounts. Dridex is one of the top-5 programs used by online criminals to gain access to victims’ financial accounts. Dridex is the fourth most encountered banking trojan, accounting for 11 percent of financial malware encountered by IBM’s X-Force research labs. Hewlett-Packard Inc. came out Jan. 31 with two new mobile thin clients that certainly look like any other laptop one can find at Best Buy or on any online retail site you can name. There's a different twist this time, however: One of the two thin clients doesn't come installed with Windows 10. The HP mt43 and HP mt20 machines are aimed a range of enterprise use cases and designed to bring enough computing power and graphics capabilities to users working on tasks in cloud-computing environments. The HP mt20 also offers a battery designed for daylong work to go with a pre-installed Linux-based OS. The 14-inch-screen HP mt43 Mobile Thin Client is crafted with premium materials for a thin, light look and feel; it features a backlit keyboard, large-format glass touchpad and HP's Bang & Olufsen audio system       Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows Google Open Sources Data Visualization Tool for Machine Learning Cisco Security Business Group Continues to Accelerate Growth Amazon Go Won't Kill Many Jobs, But It May Prove a Boon to Crooks Microsoft, Harman Kardon to Take on Amazon Echo, Google Home Yahoo Suffers New Hack; 1 Billion Users Impacted This Time 10 Things T-Mobile Has Done to Move O...

 A little known part of Amazon is growing fast — and directly competes with Google and Facebook Eugene Kim Feb. 2, 2017, 7:55 PM 11,358 facebook linkedin twitter email print Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos (L) with Google cofounder Larry Page and Facebook COO Sheryl SandbergAP Amazon may have a surprise winner in a service that directly competes with Google and Facebook's bread-and-butter business: online advertising. According to Amazon's latest earnings, the "other" revenue from its North America business — believed to be mostly comprised of its online advertising sales — saw the biggest year-over-year jump of any part of Amazon, at 60% in 2016. It recorded $1.3 billion in annual revenue. Although that's tiny compared to Google's $80 billion in ad revenue, it shows Amazon has been quietly ramping up its online advertising offerings, and could one day be a major threat in the industry. In fact, during Amazon's earnings call with investors on Thursday, UBS analyst Eric Sheridan pointed out this growth, asking where the company sees its advertising business going longer term. Amazon's CFO Brian Olsavsky didn't share much, stressing it's "very early," but did agree its online advertising business is a "good strategy" for the company. "Our goals there are to be helpful to customers and enhance their shopping and viewing experiences, mostly with targeted recommendations. We think that’s a good strategy rather than invasive things that take away from the shopping experience," Olsavsky said during the call. Olsavsky also said "sponsored product" ads are "off to a great start" and a "very effective way" to reach interested customers, while adding the company's working on some pre-roll video ads as well. "For the most part, we like the progression. We are balancing customer experience with advertising at all times, and we like the team that’s working on it," he added. Overlooked part of the business Although Amazon rarely talks about its sprawling advertising business, there's been some speculation that it could end up becoming a major part of the company's overall business. UBS's Sheridan wrote in a recent note that Amazon is continuing to expand its marketing platform by offering more "sophisticated and targeted" advertising solutions, although its revenue is still small. "We believe the long-term potential of Amazon's advertising business is still largely overlooked despite Amazon's large reach (over 300m active customers)," Sheridan wrote. UBS   According to Bloomberg's Shira Ovide and Leila Abboud, Amazon's ad business is estimated to have generated roughly $1.2 billion in 2016. If you apply Facebook's operating margin, Amazon's ad business would have made $395 million in operating income last year, a solid 18% of Amazon's total operating income. During the earnings call, Darin Manney, Amazon's head of IR, cautioned against making a big deal out of the jump in "other" revenue, stressing that it includes revenue from its co-branded credit card arrangements and other types of advertising deals. Still, Amazon seems to be drawing a lot of attention from industry big wigs, including WPP CEO Martin Sorrell, who, according to Bloomberg, recently said: "The company that would worry me if I was a client — or I think worries our clients, more than Google and Facebook — is Amazon."

Digital Trends Home > Mobile > Web apps are about to integrate a whole lot more… Web apps are about to integrate a whole lot more deeply in Android By Christian de Looper — February 2, 2017 4:15 PM Subscribe Share Malarie Gokey DigitalTrends Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Why it matters to you Web apps are about to get a lot more easy to use and interact with on Android. Web apps and Android apps are getting closer and closer in terms of user experience and on Thursday, Google announced the next stage in furthering that process. How? By integrating Progressive Web Apps more deeply into Android through App shortcuts that will show up in the phone’s app drawer. In 2015, Google first started bringing web apps to Android through a Chrome for Android update — which allowed developers to create a prompt for users to add shortcuts to web apps to the home screen. Those shortcuts, however, certainly didn’t act the same as other Android apps. With these new updates, Google is trying to remedy that. The new Chrome for Android features will be rolling out to users over the next few weeks. More: Users of iOS can now control Chromecast from their iPhone’s lock screen “In 2015, we added a new feature to Chrome for Android that allows developers to prompt users to add their site to the Home screen for fast and convenient access,” said Google in a blog post. “That feature uses an Android shortcut, which means that web apps don’t show up throughout Android in the same way as installed native apps.” Apart from appearing in the phone’s app drawer, web apps will also now be able to get incoming notifications from other apps and when you long-press one of those notifications, you will get the same notification controls that you get from normal Android apps — rather than the notification controls for Google Chrome. A new menu item will also show up for Google Chrome for Android, allowing users to more easily add web apps to the home screen. Soon, you will be able to just tap on the Chrome menu, then tap a button that says “Add to Home screen.” It will be interesting to see how web apps and Android apps merge over the next few years — and just how similar they become.
Digital Trends Home > Mobile > Google’s latest Live Case designs inspired… Google’s latest Live Case designs inspired by a New York City Ballet performance By Julian Chokkattu — February 2, 2017 4:21 PM Subscribe Share Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Why it matters to you Are you a big fan of the New York City Ballet? Google has a Live Case for your phone that you'll flip for. Google’s Live Cases allow you to add personal photos to a phone case, as well as opt for maps of your favorite locations. But the search giant also periodically partners with artists and companies to offer themed cases. The latest collaboration ties into designs worn by the New York City Ballet for “The Times are Racing.” Opening Ceremony, a New York fashion firm, is behind the costumes of the performance, and the firm has also partnered with Google to release the same designs on Live Cases. These cases are only compatible with Google’s Pixel, Pixel XL, Nexus 5X, and Nexus 6P. More: Discover new recipes and fine-tune your search results via the Google app “The designs for this ballet also inspired Opening Ceremony’s Spring 2017 ready-to-wear collection,” according to the Google Live Case website. “To extend the creative collaboration, Opening Ceremony partnered with Google to bring the eight storybook prints from the runway to Live Case for a limited time.” Opening Ceremony says the designs are influenced by the following words: Defy, fight, protest, act, unite, and change. The words embody “what it means to be American. There are eight designs to choose from, but there are six more from Opening Ceremony that were added earlier. The cases are $40 and are available now for the four aforementioned smartphones. There’s also an accompanying wallpaper you can access via the Live Case app. More: Google’s two Android Wear smartwatches will launch in February Live Cases also have an NFC button on the back that you can toggle to activate a specific function — this can be set in the app, and functions can range from setting an app shortcut to toggling the flashlight.

In disclosing various risks, the company notes that the “vast majority” of Snapchat runs on Google Cloud, with a just signed $2 billion five year deal. Additionally, work to improve the app’s experience on Android is mentioned. Under the “Risk Factors” section, Snap makes no secret that the majority of users are on iOS, thus resulting in “prioritized development” over Android. While there is feature parity, performance and experience has historically lagged on Google devices. Fortunately, Snap recognizes that they “need to prioritize development of our products to operate on smartphones with Android operating systems” in order to “continue growth in user engagement.” An additional risk is Snap’s heavy reliance on Google Cloud for “the vast majority of our computing, storage, bandwidth, and other services.” On Monday, a $2 billion deal was signed that sees Snap paying $400 million a year for Google services until 2022. While beneficial for Google’s cloud ambitions, such an infrastructure could be risky, with the filing noting how a transition “to another cloud provider would be difficult to implement and will cause us to incur significant time and expense.” It also note that some services provided by Google “do not have an alternative in the market.” However, the deal is nonexclusive, with the company currently negotiating with an undisclosed cloud provider for “redundant infrastructure support of our business operations.” More importantly, Snap notes that they might building their own infrastructure in the future.

By Larry Dignan for Between the Lines | February 3, 2017 -- 00:17 GMT (16:17 PST) | Topic: Cloud Snapchat is running its business on Google Cloud and has agreed to spend $2 billion over the next five years to the search giant. The terms of Snapchat's cloud spending with Google was detailed in the company's initial public offering filing. In that Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Snapchat cited Google Cloud as a risk factor. Snapchat said "we currently run the vast majority of our computing on Google Cloud." Meanwhile, Snapchat said a move away from Google Cloud would result in "significant time and expense." Snapchat said: We have committed to spend $2 billion with Google Cloud over the next five years and have built our software and computer systems to use computing, storage capabilities, bandwidth, and other services provided by Google, some of which do not have an alternative in the market. Given this, any significant disruption of or interference with our use of Google Cloud would negatively impact our operations and our business would be seriously harmed. If our users or partners are not able to access Snapchat through Google Cloud or encounter difficulties in doing so, we may lose users, partners, or advertising revenue. The level of service provided by Google Cloud may also impact the usage of and our users', advertisers', and partners' satisfaction with Snapchat and could seriously harm our business and reputation. If Google Cloud experiences interruptions in service regularly or for a prolonged basis, or other similar issues, our business would be seriously harmed. Hosting costs will also increase as our user base and user engagement grows and may seriously harm our business if we are unable to grow our revenues faster than the cost of utilizing the services of Google or similar providers. What makes Snapchat's comments interesting is that it's among the first to be all-in with Google Cloud. Amazon Web Services regularly touts companies that have gone all-in. Snapchat said that Google could increase pricing terms, establish relationships with rivals or modify the service. Meanwhile, Snapchat noted Google and its YouTube unit are competitors in the advertising market. The Google Cloud dependency is a risk factor, but in the grand scheme of the IPO filing it's a smaller issue. Snapchat cited inexperience in the hardware market (Spectacles), maintaining daily active user growth and competition with Facebook, Google and others as risk factors. For 2016, Snapchat lost $514.6 million on revenue of $404.48 million. In 2015, Snapchat lost $372.9 million on revenue of $58.66 million.

Emily Fortuna / Twitter Share Share Tweet Share Comment Email Print advertisement Business is anything but usual for some of America's largest companies, as they question — or blatantly decry — President Trump's immigration ban. Google, Amazon, Starbucks, and Facebook are just a few of the big names to have stepped forward and denounce Trump's executive order, which restricts the entry of refugees and citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries, and indefinitely bans Syrian refugees altogether. In the latest scuffle, Apple CEO Tim Cook told the Wall Street Journal on Tuesday his company was considering taking legal action to have Trump's executive order reversed, noting that hundreds of Apple staff had been affected by the travel ban. "More than any country in the world, this country is strong because of our immigrant background and our capacity and ability as people to welcome people from all kinds of backgrounds," Cook told the WSJ. "That's what makes us special. We ought to pause and really think deeply through that." The following Fortune 500 companies have either publicly challenged or expressed concern over the order: Amazon Apple Citigroup Expedia Facebook Ford Goldman Sachs Alphabet Intel JPMorgan Chase MasterCard Microsoft Netflix Nike Procter & Gamble Salesforce Twitter, Square, Airbnb, Github, Etsy, Lyft, Uber, Tesla, and TripAdvisor have also protested the ban, as have pharmaceutical companies sych as Allergan and Perlara. Actions Speak Louder Than Words With so many firms lending their voice to the cause, it must be asked: Is each company genuinely invested in seeing the ban dissolved because of their values — or are some brands just riding the wave of a big marketing moment? The answer is multi-faceted: On one hand, any U.S. company speaking out against the president is taking a risk; on the other hand, it comes down to what actions these brands take beyond their statements. "A lot of people do approve the ban, so these companies are taking a risk just by taking a stance against it," said Margaret Wolfson, founder and creative director at River + Wolf. "But there seem to be three levels involved: The first is in making a statement that brands you as a compassionate believer in American values; the second is in employers looking out for their employees so they feel protected, and the third level — the hardest of all because of the logistics it entails — is going beyond the verbal to the visceral and investing time, energy, and money." Google, Starbucks, Lyft, and Airbnb, are among those companies putting their money where their values are, so to speak. Related: Silicon Valley Has Visceral Reaction to Trump's Ban "We're concerned about the impact of this order and any proposals that could impose restrictions on Googlers and their families, or that could create barriers to bringing great talent to the United States," a Google spokesperson told NBC News. "We'll continue to make our views on these issues known to leaders in Washington and elsewhere." To make its views not only known, but felt, Google created a $4 million crisis fund for those affected by the ban, pledging $2 million that can be matched by up to $2 million from employees to fund organizations such as the ACLU and the International Rescue Committee. Starbucks announced it was developing plans to hire 10,000 refugees over five years in the 75 countries around the world where Starbucks operates. A spokesperson for the company declined to comment, instead referring to chairman and CEO Howard Schultz's public letter to Starbucks partners. Lyft has pledged to donate $1 million to the ACLU over the next four years. A spokesperson for the company declined to comment beyond co-founder and CEO Logan Green's three tweets and Lyft's ACLU blog post. Soon after the ban was issued, Airbnb announced that it would provide free temporary housing to refugees and others impacted by the ban. "This initiative is a part of Airbnb's longstanding commitment to addressing the needs of refugees," said an Airbnb spokesperson, citing the company's past pledge to match up to $1 million donations to UNHCR. Also to be noted is Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos' assertion that Amazon is prepared to support a lawsuit against Trump and his administration over the order, while Twitter's Jack Dorsey released a short film about Syrian refugee and entrepreneur Yassin Tehrou. Thinking on a Global Level Companies campaigning against the ban may not only be looking to protect American values, but their global relationships as well. "A lot of organizations that have and will come out against [Trump's ban] are global firms that need support in other parts of the world," said Ronald Hill, a professor of marketing and business law at Villanova School of Business. "I wouldn't be surprised if global firms coming out against it do business in areas such as Western Europe that have high Muslim populations. You have to think from a global and not just a local perspective." Hill anticipates that more businesses will be chiming in against the ban, particularly those that have a history of prioritizing corporate social responsibility — despite the backlash they may receive. "Some fashion companies came out in support of people with AIDS relatively early on when there was still backlash against that," said Hill. "This is a continuation of that corporate social responsibility, but it's a new, unexplored avenue." How the Work Pays Off While companies embark upon this new avenue, organizations such as the ACLU are prospering more than ever. "Historically, the ACLU doesn't get much support from companies. We're often viewed as a thorn in the government's side because we challenge them on issues," Mark Wier, chief development officer at the ACLU, told NBC News. "But we are seeing some companies create formalized gifts, and hundreds of thousands of small businesses have offered to share proceeds of sales." From last Friday, when Trump issued the immigration ban, to the following Monday, Wier says that the ACLU raised a record $35 million. Related: Celebs and VIPs Donate to ACLU to Fight Trump "We've never seen that kind of outpouring so quickly," said Wier, adding that the ACLU will use the funding to hire over 100 employees including litigators, advocates, and communications specialists. "We need to power up the grid up we've already established with more force," said Wier. "Since the ACLU was able to get a stay on that executive order in federal district court, people are really seeing that it is possible to do something — and to actually win."

The search giant has updated its Google app algorithm to allow you to narrow down your search by things like ingredients, flavors, and cooking method. Now when searching for a recipe, you'll see a number of clickable options below the search bar that you can use to narrow your search down even further and get closer to the perfect dish. For instance, a search for "chicken wings" within the Google app on your phone will produce terms like "crispy," "honey," and "buffalo" below the search bar. Click one, and you'll be given even more narrowing terms, so you can pinpoint that grilled honey mustard wing recipe you're looking for. Google Trends offers a strangely illuminating glimpse into what’s on Americans’ minds — and 2016 is no exception. Here’s the map showing their results: Estately Here are some highlights of what Google users were looking into across the nation: Alabama: Harper Lee (the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of “To Kill a Mockingbird” who died in 2016) Georgia: New Comey Letter (after the FBI director reopened the inquiry into Hillary Clinton’s email server) and Harriet Tubman (the anti-slavery icon chosen to adorn new $20 bills) New York: Panama Papers (the millions of leaked documents that detail financial and attorney–client information for more than 200,000 offshore entities worldwide) Missouri: McDonald’s breakfast all day (a big move announced by the fast food chain in 2016) New Mexico: Gary Johnson (the Libertarian candidate for president in 2016 who won 0 electoral votes) Vermont: Orlando Bloom naked (no explanation necessary) Media: WochIt Media The feature is a good one, but is also optional. So, if you just want to look at all the chicken wing recipe options out there and narrow down your search by what looks good, you can still do that too. The idea with this one is that when you do know exactly what you're looking for, Google can help you find it quickly. And if you're not quite sure what you're looking for, the app can offer some guidance on what's out there. For now, the feature is only available in Google's mobile app. To use it, you'll need to download the app onto your mobile phone or tablet from the App Store or Google Play.

Turns out that they might, according to a recent tweet by 9to5Google’s Stephen Hall who revealed that Google Assistant could soon find its way to the Nexus 5X/6P. According to Hall’s tweet, it seems that the voice assistant could find its way onto Google’s Nexus handsets in the next “major” update, which is unclear as to when that might be. Hall also points out how a Googler had recently posted on Google+ that the Nexus Player will also be getting Google Assistant, so the idea of the feature arriving on Nexus handsets doesn’t really seem like that much of a stretch. Was recently told that Assistant is finally coming to Nexus 5X/6P soon with next “major” update. — Stephen Hall (@hallstephenj) February 2, 2017 With the Pixel handsets, Google has been attempting a different strategy than the one they employed with the Nexus, where certain features, such as Google Assistant, would be exclusive to the Pixel phones. Even the Pixel’s launcher was different from the Nexus handsets, so it is clear that Google sees the Pixels as more than just a phone that runs on vanilla Android. Either way we suppose this is good news, assuming the information is accurate, but do check back with us in the coming weeks/months to see when this alleged “major” update will be arriving. In the meantime there’s an unofficial method to getting Google Assistant on your phone, with the instructions posted on XDA. Filed in Cellphones >Rumors. Read more about Google and google assistant.

In fact, many studies have been done that show that slight changes in the structure of a landing page can double, or even triple conversions overnight. That is a lot easier than spending hours on SEO, PR, Google Adwords, Facebook ads, and other expensive marketing tactics. The only real hard part is figuring out what those slight changes need to be. Here are four keys to creating a successfully converting landing page and examples. Simplify Companies and individuals often get so caught up in trying to explain how incredible their product or service is that they forget they have time constraints. The average user will not show up to a web page and read all of the copy and then make a well-informed decision. Many consumers give a webpage less than 10 seconds to capture their attention or their information and then they are gone. Bills.com has a great landing page that simplifies its purpose into one question, essentially asking why they are on the site. Then Bills.com is able to direct them to the most relevant information for them and keep them long enough to start building rapport. Explain the benefit Once you simplify, then you focus on explaining the benefit to your product or service in as few words as possible. If you are selling an app that can help people manage their time more effectively, you might write something along the lines of “Eliminate wasted time and double your productivity with X”. You have helped the user see what problem your service solves, helped them to see how it will be solved, and done so in just a few seconds. Conveniently, a great example of this is Unbounce, a leader in conversion page optimization. Their homepage quickly explains the benefit and keeps the benefit explanation as close to the call to action as possible. CTA location CTAs can be sometimes hard to work in. Any SEO worth their salt will explain that a webpage needs a lot of words and written content in order to show up in search engines. Companies like Google do not have a lot to go off besides words, meaning words matter quite a bit. Many companies and especially new entrepreneurs make the mistake of writing their 2,000 word landing page and then putting the CTA at the end. After all, it makes sense to do it this way. Sell first, ask for their business at the end. That model doesn’t work when they are a click away from leaving. Here is a great example of a page with lots of content that is useful, but offering the CTA at the beginning for those that are ready to make a decision already. Then the top of the page offers links that can take you to other places in the page that may answer specific questions. Design around CTA Remember, your entire goal is to get the user to click the CTA on the page. This needs to show in your design. The first thing a user’s eyes should go to on a landing page is the CTA. They can then browse other parts of the page that they find relevant, but they always know just where and what the CTA is. Trulia, and most real estate sites, do a great job of this. They start getting information from you as soon as they can and make it very easy to dive into the funnel and get started. The real thing to remember with landing pages is that there is no one guaranteed strategy. That is why true marketers are constantly testing and improving their landing pages. It is usually much easier to improve conversions than it is to increase traffic quickly. Love this article?

TECHNOLOGY Tech Giants Join Forces to Challenge Trump's Immigration Moves in Court The industry is leading the fight to roll back executive orders on travel from Muslim countries, sanctuary cities, and more.

After vocally and monetarily protesting Trump's orders, several tech companies are now banding together to mount a legal challenge. This makeshift coalition of companies is being organized by San Francisco startup Github, according to Reuters. Companies that have been invited to a Tuesday gathering include Google, Airbnb, and Netflix, the report said. The goal is to put together an amicus brief, otherwise known as a friend-of-the-court filing, to aid litigants. It's unclear which case or cases the brief would address, but on Tuesday, the city of San Francisco formerly filed a lawsuit against Trump claiming that his order threatening to take away federal funding from so-called Sanctuary Cities is in violation of the 10th Amendment. Sanctuary Cities are counties or cities that do not enforce federal immigration laws. For San Francisco, where there are hundreds or even thousands of startups that rely on foreign talent to build software and hardware, fighting for Sanctuary City status sends a sign to the world that immigrants are welcome, says Laura Gomez, CEO of Atipica, a Bay Area talent discovery startup. "Immigration is key to technology -- on one side, H-1B visa holders, and on the other, immigrants who serve those tech workers," says Gomez, who is from Mexico and originally arrived in the U.S. as an undocumented immigrant. "They may or may not be undocumented, but most certainly, they know someone who is." Up north in Washington, Amazon and Microsoft have also joined the fight. There, Attorney General Bob Ferguson has filed a lawsuit claiming Trump's Muslim ban is unconstitutional. That order has prevented refugees, travelers with visas, and dual citizens from seven Muslim countries from entering the United States. Amazon and Microsoft, as well as Expedia, will be providing Ferguson with information detailing their reliance on immigrant workers to aid in the lawsuit. "We're a nation of immigrants whose diverse backgrounds, ideas, and points of view have helped us build and invent as a nation for over 240 years," said Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos in a memo sent to his employees on Monday. "To our employees in the U.S. and around the world who may be directly affected by this order, I want you to know that the full extent of Amazon's resources are behind you."

Name: Subject: Message: Google Photos ‘Albums’ view gets tweaked to show more stuff Newsby Scott Adam Gordon36 minutes ago 25 4 The latest Google Photos app update, version 2.8, introduces some changes to the albums view to include more pictures. The albums tab is now divided into three sections: exploration, photos on device and user-created albums. The exploration row previously seen in albums contains collections of photos like People, Places, Things etc. — it’s the albums generated by Google’s algorithms to help you find specific types of pictures.  This row is now larger and holds more thumbnails, four instead of three, so you know more about the content inside before clicking through. The Photos on Device row used to be called Device Folders and contains pictures taken with your camera app, your screenshots, as well as media from other apps like WhatsApp or Twitter. See also: Instagram testing multiple photos in one post with some Android users 1 day ago The third row is for the albums you’ve created. Unlike the full-width photos provided before, however, these are now also shown as square tiles like the other content. Overall, there’s more information to seen on the album page now and it’s easier to see what’s inside your galleries; it’s a subtle update, but a smart one.

By Charles Firth 5:04 PM Friday Feb 3, 2017 SHARE: Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Not saved Email Print International Politics Sponsor message.   Video will play in Play now Don't auto play Never auto play Is what we're witnessing in the US a slow-motion downhill slide into a coup? A fascinating and scary article has been doing the rounds in recent days, which suggests that Donald Trump's ban on immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries was an attempt to see how far he can push his power, as the first step to mounting an all-out coup. A Google engineer named Yonatan Zunger has suggested that the way the White House has repeatedly gone around long standing conventions shows it is testing to see whether a coup is possible. One man's coup is another man's "strong leadership". But what Zunger is talking about is Mr Trump's inner circle grabbing power in a similar way that Vladimir Putin has done in Russia, where he exercises power unchallenged by any other body. Sure, he still has a court system and a legislative body, but they are largely irrelevant, and Mr Putin would ignore them if they ever opposed him. Zunger's point is that last weekend the White House and Department of Homeland Security happily ignored court orders related to the Muslim ban, and there was no real consequence to it. If Mr Trump's inner circle gets good at going around the conventional processes, the result is essentially coup-like: Congress and the Supreme Court can try to oppose him all it likes, but if he's willing to just keep going around the normal processes, there is not a lot they can do. This is normally accompanied by a Kleptocratic approach to the nation's finances. Kleptocracy is "rule by thieves". The argument that Zunger presents is that Mr Trump's refusal to divest himself of assets shows a proclivity to use the office to enrich himself and his family. But coup or not, Zunger has identified some tendencies in Mr Trump's leadership style are worth exploring. Continued below. Related Content Development window closing for Silver Ferns coach Janine Southby Video Market Watch: Risks caused by Donald Trump Malcolm Turnbull staffer suspended over Donald Trump post In the weeks since his inauguration, Mr Trump has repeatedly projected his power without being challenged by going around all the normal processes. The most visible - and trivial - example of this is Mr Trump's use of Twitter. Mr Trump's tweets about his conversation with Prime Minister 'Trumbull' stomped on centuries of diplomatic protocol. And he uses Twitter every day to get his message out unchallenged by the questioning (and fact-checking) of the press. Don't get me wrong - it's spectacular to watch - but it shows in Mr Trump a desire to be unchallenged and unmediated by the normal processes of government - whether they're diplomatic protocols or scrutiny by the media. If it were just his tweets, that would be one thing, but he's taking the same approach across the board. Normally, when a President gets into power, he rushes to appoint the roughly 660 senior officials that need approval from Congress. That's because he's hoping to get the departments (which employ millions of people) working according to his agenda. Indeed, for centuries, that's been the main prize of winning the presidency. You get to set the agenda for how millions of Americans administer the government. Instead, Mr Trump only named 29 appointees by the time he was inaugurated. Twenty nine out of 660. In one light, you could argue that this shows that Mr Trump and his inner circle are just deeply incompetent. But you could also consider another possibility - that on the whole, Mr Trump doesn't care that much about who runs the bureaucracy, because that's not how he's planning on projecting his power. It's now becoming clear that the supposed "mass resignations" of nearly all of the senior staff at the State Department was a purge ordered by the White House. Look at the chart that Emily Gorcenski tweeted around. That's not an orderly transition. That's a wipe-out. Many commentators have lamented the purge means that it will be months - if not years - before the State Department has an effective leadership at the top of it that allows it to participate in Federal policy decisions. But if you follow Zunger's thinking, perhaps that's the intention. The purge happened the day before Mr Trump announced his ban on immigration from seven Muslim countries, a ban which many in the State Department would have reflexively opposed. By taking out the State Department, he was able to exercise his power unchallenged. Clearly certain parts of that order were unconstitutional. At least three judges in the US have now ruled against it, and if it ever gets in front of the Supreme Court, there is a case that it breaches the US Constitution's values of equal protection and religious freedom. But even with a neutered State Department, if Mr Trump had run the Order by the Department of Homeland Security and the Attorney General, the Order would have been neutered out of all its blustery impact. Instead, by going around the normal process of checks and balances, it worked. Sure, various courts around the US ordered stays on some provisions in the Order, but the Order's intent - to keep people from seven countries from entering the United States - remains in place. By finding ways to exercise power unchallenged, Mr Trump's inner circle were able to enact an unconstitutional order. And the only lesson that they derived from it is that it actually doesn't matter how unconstitutional something they do is, as long as they go around the Departments that will object, they can get it done. The list goes on. Mr Trump issued an extraordinary 20 executive orders in his first 10 days. If you read through them, they are hilariously amateurish in their drafting. I know this sounds like a joke, but one of the orders - honestly - declared the day of his inauguration The National Day of Patriotic Devotion. I'm not making it up. The Order itself reads like a decree from Kim Jong Un. As you read through them, it becomes clear they have not gone through the conventional methods for drafting executive orders - which involves showing them to the relevant department for input. At times they are vague, at other times the wording is flowery. They are not the work of experts. The White House has confirmed to multiple reporters that they have been drafted by Mr Trump's inner circle, and released without any input from the Departments that are expected to carry them out. Again, this might be incompetence - many of his inner circle have no previous experience in government. But it might also be they simply don't care about what the Departments think about his orders. Or worse, they know exactly what they think, and are seeking ways to avoid that scrutiny. Properly gauging how Mr Trump is exercising his power is important because many of those who oppose Mr Trump are still in a state of denial that he is really behaving in this way. The insider analysis is still largely that the institutions of Congress, the Court System, and even the bureaucratic procedures of the Departments, will place roadblocks around Mr Trump. But what no-one seems to realise is that these institutions are not set up to deal with being circumnavigated, especially not by someone as powerful as a President. And where it starts getting into coup territory is when you realise that he's even sidelined the US Military from the normal processes in recent weeks. Take, for example, the most powerful body in the US Military hierarchy: the Joint Chiefs of Staff. These are the seven top leaders of all four arms of the military. On Monday, Mr Trump pulled the Joint Chiefs' representative off the top committee of the National Security Council, and instead appointed his civilian adviser (and far-right nationalist) Steve Bannon to run the committee. Now the military has no permanent member on the committee which directs national security decisions. This is unprecedented. Nobody ever thought that a President would go around the back of a Department or the Military, simply because, being President, the Department and the Military is formally already his to control. But if Mr Trump is prepared to go around his departments and media, ignore diplomatic protocols and sideline the US Military, will he really obey the will of Congress and the Supreme Court when they start trying to put limits on his power? What it means is that much of the conventional thinking about how Mr Trump's presidency will play out needs to be completely rethought. It's no use running off to a court to get the President's order declared unconstitutional if the President plans on ignoring the court's declaration. It's no use hoping the military will place roadblocks on his latest National Security plan, because they're no longer on the committee. The rule book for how power is exercised in the US is currently being torn up. The question is whether what it's replaced with will be in any way democratic. If the Republicans in Congress try to block Mr Trump from getting his way on something, he's likely to just go around them. If the past two weeks are any guide, the conventional institutions are unlikely to provide much of a buffer from a President intent on ignoring them. In the meantime, Mr Trump will continue to build parallel institutions, that mean that should the support from all the institutions evaporate, he can still carry on. Consider this: Mr Trump has retained his own private security, rather than relying exclusively on the Secret Service. Indeed, the man who has been head of security for 15 years, Keith Schiller, is now the head of Oval Office operations. This has never happened before. The US Secret Service has an institutional imperative to protect the President, regardless of what happens. Of course, if all the institutions did turn against President Trump, and it became murky about who the legitimate President was, who knows how the US Secret Service would react.

ITProPortal Search RSS News Features Analysis Guides Reviews Categories Business Hardware Security Software Mobile Enterprise Cloud Networks Public Sector Startups Web UMi Plus E smartphone By Desire Athow Review  Mobiles catching up with laptops Shares Jump to Section: Best Price Comments Our Verdict Premium experience with an affordable price tag. This is a close as you will get to a super phone without breaking the bank Pros 6GB of RAM 64GB storage Relatively affordable, yet still feels premium Cons Metallic noise associated with buttons No NFC Smartphones have replaced tablets and traditional computers for millions of users as the preferred – and often only – way to access the internet.  While the initial waves of devices were nothing more than souped-up feature phones, the past couple of years have seen the arrival of models that are not only far more sophisticated but also significantly more powerful than their predecessors. Take the UMi Plus E for example which packs the sort of firepower that you would expect from a mid-range to high end laptop but with a price tag that’s more than reasonable.  But there’s more to it than just the hardware as we’ll reveal later and there’s plenty of hints as to where the next generation of smartphones will be heading.  Gearbest – which provided us with the review sample – sells the UMi Plus E for £216.45. These costs are exclusive of any taxes that may be levied by HMRC or the courier companies on behalf of the vendor. Want to buy tech from online Chinese retailers? Read this first.  The design The attention to details starts with the box itself. For the first time in a while, we’ve been impressed by the packaging of a smartphone. UMi clearly understands that making a good impression even before you handle the device is important. As such there’s no cardboard box but instead, a customised polycarbonate box that adds to the exclusive feel of the UMi Plus E.  This is clearly a smartphone that aspires to compete in the high-end market as designers have liberally inspired themselves from the Google Pixel smartphone, a device that costs nearly three times more. Put side by side, the similarities are flagrant but it is unlikely that Google will go after Chinese smartphone vendors for imitating its flagship device.  After all, it is for the common good of Android as an ecosystem. The UMi Plus E has an aluminium alloy unibody design (“6000 series with anodic oxidation process” says the marketing brochure) and a Sharp-sourced 2.5D arc 5.5-inch LTPS full HD screen display with 3D polishing, a higher screen-to-body ratio (thanks to a narrow bezel) and T2X-1 glass protection. The end result is a device that can be comfortably held in one hand with a premium feel and, unlike the Honor 8, one which won’t slip due to a glass back. Two speakers are located at the bottom of the device with a USB type-C port bang in the middle.  There’s a single physical button on the bottom front which doubles as a fingerprint reader. On either side of the UMi Plus E are a dedicated camera button, the power button and a volume one. A quick note about the buttons; for some reason, the last two appear to be a tad loose, that is, they tend to produce a slight metallic noise when operated.  Could well be a rogue pre-production snafu but you’ve been warned. A dual-flash 13-megapixel camera with a Samsung sensor (S5K3L8) that is capable of recording 4K video can be found at the back. UMi claims that the phone’ phase detection auto focus (PDAF) technology can fast focus in about 100ms. A front-facing 5-megapixel shooter completes the feature list.   The hardware Uniquely amongst smartphones that aspire to conquer the top-end of the market, the UMi Plus E sports a Mediatek SoC, the Helio 820, which is an 8-core Cortex-A53 powered powerhouse clocked at 2.3GHz with an ARM Mali-T880 MP2GPU running alongside it at 0.9GHz. That system-on-chip is fabbed by TSMC using a 16nm FinFET fabrication node which, while not as advanced as the competition, ensures adequate power consumption/dissipation. The phone also offers 4G+/Cat 6 LTE (up to 300Mbps) as well as VoLTE; shame that you can only get two nano SIM cards to run if you sacrifice the microSD card. Note that the device comes with 64GB onboard storage already so that should alleviate most users’ need for space. The UMi Plus E is also one of a handful of devices that offer 6GB of RAM (LPDDR4 and 64GB (eMMC 5.1), both manufactured by Samsung. Could such profligacy in terms of resources potentially paves the way to Windows-on-smartphones soon? That could well be an option. Despite being relatively portable for a 5.5-inch model (15.60 x 7.60 x 0.91 cm and a weight of 185g), engineers have still managed to squeeze a Sony-sourced battery with a staggering 4,000mAh capacity, far more than on the Pixel. The UMi Plus E can be fully charged in less than two hours using its proprietary charger; that latter delivers between 1.25A and 2.5A using Mediatek’s own PE+ Quick Charge technology. Shame that there is no NFC feature but it does have status LED.    In use As expected, the phone runs on Android 6.0 Marshmallow and UMi has dropped in its own custom user interface instead of going stock. This is a damn powerful smartphone and while we didn’t game on it or run anything taxing on it, the sheer amount of resources available should make an easy task out of anything thrown at it.  The combination of the X20 with 6GB of RAM and eMMC 5.1 storage is lethal.  There should be enough firepower in that phone to compete even with a mid-range Windows-based laptop.   Verdict One would have to be seriously biased against the UMi Plus E in order not to appreciate the sheer competitiveness of the smartphone. It is keenly priced, has an exquisite design and doesn’t look cheap compared to more premium smartphones like the Google Pixel. Upgradability is an unknown quantity at this stage as UMi is a relative newcomer for us. Combined with the fact that this smartphone lacks NFC capabilities, both arguments prevent it from becoming our all-time favourite. Also bear in mind that you are unlikely to find a wide variety of accessories to equip it. What does the phone tell us about the future of Chinese smartphones? Expect the price of the flagship smartphones to gradually creep up as they catch up on traditional leaders (Sony, HTC, LG and Samsung). The Verdict 4.25 out of 5 UMi Plus E Premium experience with an affordable price tag.

Feb. 22 in Vancouver. Except for the new regime in the White House of course, where they’re calling it “alternative facts.” In a twist straight out of Orwell’s 1984, the president called a CNN reporter “fake news” for asking him a question he didn’t want to answer. But whatever you call it, the fact remains that if you get your news online you have to stay alert if you want to separate the alternative facts from the real ones. Which is where some research by an Elon University communications professor comes in. Jonathan Albright looked at the mechanics of how misinformation spreads online and it turns out that Facebook isn’t the main culprit. The fakers are circulating their inventions the old-fashioned way, by sending the story links through email and linking the stories to legitimate sites like the New York Times or YouTube. To show how the propaganda industry works, Albright did a graphic of his research, which reveals the junk sites hovering like satellites around legitimate websites, with masses of red threads between them, showing links. The Tyee is supported by readers like you Join us and grow independent media in Canada The propagandists also send a small army of digital elves, human and robot, to add links to their dodgy sites in the comments sections of legitimate, general interest news sites. The Russian propagandists are particularly active and most comments sections have regular posters who urge readers to have a look at RT television, Sputnik News, and the long list of websites that will assure you Vladimir Putin and his dictator pals, like Syria’s Bashar al-Assad, are all beloved leaders. The postings are often unintentionally comic in way the short-fingered vulgarian’s Twitter feed is a scream — so outrageous you can’t help but laugh. Well, until you remember whose tiny hands are on the nukes. So we’re all tempted to take a look at the links, just out of curiosity. Then, since most of us use Google, the bots will think we like that sort of thing. The search engines are optimized to respond to all our online activities, including the sites we visit and the links we share. Search results rank the findings of a search based on what they think we’re likely to want. It makes the search engine more useful when we’re shopping for shoes. But it’s not so useful when it comes to informing citizens. And if you follow the links to enough dodgy sites it will have an impact on what you see on Google news, as well as in search. Eventually, you will start seeing fanciful tales to the effect that the U.S.’s new first lady is a Russian spy reporting back to Putin. Again, it’s comic. Not to mention being a fine plot for a TV series. But in the daily struggle to stay informed it’s also an annoying distraction. So while I see freedom of speech and freedom of the press as crucial to democracy — I’m appalled at the number of people calling for censorship — I also find that constantly sorting through fake news crap is a time-suck. So I resist the bots with a number of tools, including alternate search engines. Duck Duck Go is a well-established alternative that let’s you do an end-run around the Google bots, but there are plenty of options including Yippy and StartPage. The upshot is that I see very few of those fake news stories — from either the lefty propagandists or the authoritarian right-wingers — unless I go hunting for them. As for the stupid stories that show up via people’s Facebook posts, I control that by “unfollowing” the people who post this nonsense. You remain connected as friends, so you’re not insulting your clueless uncle who loves this stuff, but you ensure that he doesn’t waste your time, either. The list of sites pandering to liberals is shorter, suggesting that what one of the commercial fake news producers told NPR’s Planet Money may be true: right-wingers are just more likely to “take the bait.” Why the ‘Rise’ of Fake News Is Just Not True read more As for some of the worst of the online fraudsters, Google is already on the case. One approach is to make it hard for the junk sites to profit from their inventions by kicking them out of the Google ads program. So the boys in the Balkans, who had the right-wingers in lather over sensational anti-Clinton stories, can no longer make a tidy profit with their lies. Facebook has also been experimenting with AIs — artificial intelligence robots — filtering content, but that raises new problems. In the fall, the social media site came under fire for writes in The Guardian. “But I can see where we might be headed: the suppression of alternative voices and the censorship of content that addresses certain issues.” But I think there is a practical solution to propaganda: individual citizens have to take a DIY approach to excluding it. As news consumers, we need develop the digital version of the reflex that makes us ignore the National Enquirer on the magazine rack. And that begins with developing online habits that prevent us noticing the junk in the first place.

 Tech giants take on each other in the smart home BI Intelligence Jan. 30, 2017, 10:45 AM 2,330 facebook linkedin twitter email print BI Intelligence See Also Many people still see smart home voice assistants as a novelty The Internet of Everything — $12.6 trillion ROI expected over the next decade [SLIDE DECK] Here's what the hire of Dropcam’s founder means for Apple This story was delivered to BI Intelligence IoT Briefing subscribers. To learn more and subscribe, please click here. Over the past year, the world’s largest tech companies’ smart home ecosystems have taken shape, and the market strategies for the three largest of these companies is now clear. However, as Reuters notes, this will set the companies on a collision course with each other as the smart home matures and becomes a more mainstream consumer service. Apple’s HomeKit is centered on sales of the iPhone, the remote of the HomeKit ecosystem. While the entire ecosystem is built around Apple products, with the Apple TV or iPad serving as the hub for the HomeKit ecosystem, the iPhone is the only prerequisite for a user to set up an Apple Home ecosystem. Users can still operate the ecosystem without an Apple TV or iPad, albeit only from inside the home rather than remotely. This helps the company because each iPhone user with iOS 10 has the ability to set up HomeKit devices and use Apple products to adopt the smart home. The Google Home is centered on targeting users with ads. The company is one of the largest in the world to rely on ads as its primary stream of revenue, announcing a whopping $79.4 billion from its AdSense division on its earnings call last week, the overwhelming majority of the Alphabet parent’s total revenue. While Alphabet bought the device makers Nest and Dropcam in recent years, it doesn't have the built-in user base that Apple has with iPhone. It may boast a technological advantage in the Google Assistant, however, over Alexa and Siri at this point, as Sundar Pichai argued on the company’s earnings call. Amazon’s Echo products are designed to be an access point to the Prime network. As BI Intelligence has previously identified, the online retailer’s monetization strategy doesn't focus on the hardware of the Echo devices, but rather on connecting users directly to the Prime network without having to go through an iPhone or Google search engine to do so. This creates a recurring revenue stream for the online retailer. As Alexa’s reach continues to expand, it will become an even larger monetization asset for Amazon by allowing more points of entry into the Prime network. But Apple may fall behind Google and Amazon due to its heavy reliance on iPhone sales to monetize the smart home. As previously noted, Apple is only one of the three companies listed above to rely on hardware to drive revenue in the smart home space. Amazon and Google will continue to be able to monetize the smart home even if the sales of their hardware decline, which is especially relevant given the recent trend of iPhone sales stagnation. But with a new tenth-anniversary iPhone on the horizon this year, the company might be able to overcome this at least temporarily. Further, despite that the company might not be able to get more people to buy iPhones and set up HomeKit, it still has a massive iPhone user base that works to its advantage. The U.S. smart home market has yet to truly take off. At its current state, we believe the smart home market is stuck in the 'chasm' of the technology adoption curve, in which it is struggling to surpass the early-adopter phase and move to the mass-market phase of adoption. There are many barriers preventing mass-market smart home adoption: high device prices, limited consumer demand and long device replacement cycles. However, the largest barrier is the technological fragmentation of the smart home ecosystem, in which consumers need multiple networking devices, apps and more to build and run their smart home. John Greenough, senior research analyst for BI Intelligence, Business Insider's premium research service, has compiled a detailed report on the U.S. smart home market that analyzes current consumer demand for the smart home and barriers to widespread adoption. It also analyzes and determines areas of growth and ways to overcome barriers. Here are some key takeaways from the report: Smart home devices are becoming more prevalent throughout the US. We define a smart home device as any stand-alone object found in the home that is connected to the internet, can be either monitored or controlled from a remote location, and has a noncomputing primary function. Multiple smart home devices within a single home form the basis of a smart home ecosystem. Currently, the US smart home market as a whole is in the "chasm" of the tech adoption curve. The chasm is the crucial stage between the early-adopter phase and the mass-market phase, in which manufacturers need to prove a need for their devices. High prices, coupled with limited consumer demand and long device replacement cycles, are three of the four top barriers preventing the smart home market from moving from the early-adopter stage to the mass-market stage. For example, mass-market consumers will likely wait until their device is broken to replace it. Then they will compare a nonconnected and connected product to see if the benefits make up for the price differential. The largest barrier is technological fragmentation within the connected home ecosystem. Currently, there are many networks, standards, and devices being used to connect the smart home, creating interoperability problems and making it confusing for the consumer to set up and control multiple devices. Until interoperability is solved, consumers will have difficulty choosing smart home devices and systems. "Closed ecosystems" are the short-term solution to technological fragmentation. Closed ecosystems are composed of devices that are compatible with each other and which can be controlled through a single point.

Note: This is based on Docker 1.12 as of the time of writing. Whilst Docker 1.13 is now released, it is not yet in the CoreOS builds. As soon as 1.13 is available, I will append a footnote to this article and edit this note! As more and more people jump on the Docker bandwagon, more and more people are wondering just exactly how we scale this thing. Some will have heard of Docker-Compose, some will have heard of Docker Swarm, and then there are some folks out there with their Kubernetes and Mesos clusters. Docker Swarm became native to Docker in v1.12 and makes container orchestration super simple. Not only that, but each node is accessible via the hostname due to the built-in DNS and Service Discovery. With its overlay network and inbuilt routing mesh, all the nodes can accept connections on the published ports for any of the services running in the Swarm. This basically gives you the access to multiple nodes and treat them as one. Just to top it off, Docker Swarm has built-in load balancing. Send a request to any of the nodes and it will send the request in a round-robin fashion to all the containers running the requested service. Simply amazing, and I’m going to show you how you can get started with this great technology. For my example, I’ve chosen a PHP application (cue the flames), it’s a great way to show how a real-world app may be scaled. There are a few parts that I will be covering: Creating base images Using Docker-Compose in Development Creating the infrastructure (Terraform) Creating a base image (Packer) Deploying Scaling 1. Creating Base Images You may already be familiar with keeping provisioned AMIs/images up in the cloud that contain most of the services you need. That's essentially all a base/foundation image is. The reality is that every time you push your code, you don't want to have to wait for the stock CentOS/Ubuntu image to be re-provisioned. Base images allow you to create a basic setup that you can use not just on one project, but on multiple projects. What I've done, is created a repository called, Docker Images, which currently has just two services; Nginx and PHP-FPM. Inside it is a little build script which iterates over each container, builds it and then pushes it to Docker Hub. Your foundation images can contain whatever you want. Mine have some simple configuration such as nginx/php-fpm configuration. I have configured Supervisord to ensure that php-fpm is always running. Additionally, as I am placing both dev and prod versions of php.ini on the container, the Supervisord accepts environment parameters so the container can be fired up in dev mode or production ready. This is the build.sh script within the Docker Images repo: Build.sh: #!/bin/bash

VERSION=1
CONTAINER=$1
BUILD_NUMBER=$2

docker build ./$CONTAINER -t bobbydvo/ukc_$CONTAINER:latest
docker tag bobbydvo/ukc_$CONTAINER:latest  bobbydvo/ukc_$CONTAINER:$VERSION.$BUILD_NUMBER

docker push bobbydvo/ukc_$CONTAINER:latest
docker push bobbydvo/ukc_$CONTAINER:$VERSION.$BUILD_NUMBER A simple Jenkins job with parameterised builds has been configured to pass the correct arguments to the script: echo $BUILD_NUMBER
docker -v
whoami
sudo docker login -u bobbydvo -p Lr6n9hrGBLNxBm
sudo ./build.sh $CONTAINER $BUILD_NUMBER Note: You will have to ensure that the Jenkins user is allowed sudo access You can find the repository here. Each time the job is run, it will place new versions of each container here. Some may argue that due to the cache built up in layers within Docker, you can skip the Base Image step. However, I find it to be a great way to keep jobs isolated, with the addition of being able to re-use the containers for other projects. It also gives great visibility when a container-build has failed simply because an external package has been updated, and therefore it will not update your 'latest' tag and won't halt your deployments! Google has a great guide on building Foundation Images We now need to test our two images/containers with our PHP app. 2. Using Docker-Compose in Dev This is my repository with a dummy PHP app. If you're familiar with PHP, you will notice that this is a Slim 3 application using Composer for dependency management. You'll also find a file, 'docker-compose.yml' - this will coordinate Docker to use both of our containers: Docker-compose.yml: version: "2"
services:
  php-fpm:
    tty: true
    build: ./
    image: bobbydvo/dummyapp_php-fpm:latest
    ports:
      - "9000:9000"
    environment:
      - APPLICATION_ENV=dev
  web:
    tty: true
    image: bobbydvo/ukc_nginx:latest
    ports:
      - "80:80"
    environment:
      - NGINX_HOST=localhost
      - NGINX_PORT=80 The php-fpm container will use the Dockerfile in the root of the application to build the image, copy over the files onto the Docker Image itself, and save the image locally as a new container, rather than the use the base image. As it happens, the Nginx container doesn't need any modification, as it's only the PHP app that will change when we add code. Of course, you can change this to suit your needs if necessary. Running the application is as simple as typing: docker-compose up You can now head over to http://localhost and test the application. It will be lightning fast. However, this means that the code on the container is what was copied over when docker-compose up was executed. Any changes to local code will not be reflected. There is a solution to this, and it's in the form of 'dev.yml'. This extends the docker-compose.yml file to mount the local volume onto the web root. docker-compose up -f docker-compose.yml -f dev.yml Now you can head to http://localhost, make some changes, and refresh, and you will see that it's just as though you're coding locally. Hurrah! Note: There is a known bug with Docker for Mac, which means that the mounted volume has a bit of latency which can affect load times unless you make use of OPCache in dev mode. However, this is being worked on. So now what? We have some shiny Docker containers that are working brilliantly together for our PHP app. Great for development, but what about the real world? Our next topic will cover how to use Terraform to create a number of servers that will create 3 Docker Managers as well as a number of Docker Slave nodes. Unfortunately, the CoreOS (great for Docker) image provided doesn't have Docker Swarm, as this is still in the Beta channel. First we will have to create a new Docker Swarm enabled image using Packer, so let's go ahead and do that first! 3. Using Packer to Create a New Image in Cloud-Native Infrastructure Packer is another tool from Hashicorp which is comprised of a set of builders, and provisioners. It supports many builders such as AWS (AMI), Azure, DigitalOcean, Docker, Google, VirtualBox, VMWare, and, of course, the one we need; OpenStack. There are some others that it supports too which is great if you need it! In terms of provisioning, you can use most of the popular tools such as Ansible, Puppet or Chef, as well as PowerShell and standard shell scripts. For us, all we need to do is to take the stock image of CoreOS and tell it to use the Beta channel, which includes Docker Swarm, this can be done by modifying this file: /etc/coreos/update.conf ...with this data: GROUP=beta Currently, Docker Swarm doesn't work with docker-compose.yml files. There is an experimental feature with Stacks and Bundles, but at the time of writing, it's not made its way into any of the CoreOS builds and has not been mapped out fully in the Docker pipeline yet. However, we'll also install Docker Compose onto CoreOS whilst we're provisioning, as it's a great tool for testing. As mentioned, we are going to use the OpenStack builder, so here is our 'builder' entry: "builders": [
    {
      "type": "openstack",
      "image_name": "CoreOS-Docker-Beta-1-12",
      "source_image": "8e892f81-2197-464a-9b6b-1a5045735f5d",
      "flavor": "c46be6d1-979d-4489-8ffe-e421a3c83fdd",
      "ssh_keypair_name": "ukcloudos",
      "ssh_private_key_file": "/Users/bobby/.ssh/ukcloudos",
      "use_floating_ip": true,
      "floating_ip_pool": "internet",
      "ssh_username": "core",
      "ssh_pty" : true
    }
  ], The type is required and must state the builder-type you're using, whereas the imagename should be set to whatever you want your new image to be called. Sourceimage is the original image that is in Glance already. The builder also wants to know a flavor of the builder, I'm choosing a small instance as this is only to provision. Note: Ensure that you are using an existing keypair name that is in your OpenStack project. So, now that we have a builder, along with connectivity, let's provision it: "provisioners": [
    {
      "type": "shell",
      "inline": [
        "sudo sh -c 'echo GROUP=beta > /etc/coreos/update.conf'",
        "sudo systemctl restart update-engine",
        "sudo update_engine_client -update",
        "sudo sh -c 'mkdir /opt/'",
        "sudo sh -c 'mkdir /opt/bin'",
        "sudo sh -c 'curl -L https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.9.0/docker-compose-`uname -s`-`uname -m` > /opt/bin/docker-compose'",
        "sudo sh -c 'chmod +x /opt/bin/docker-compose'"
      ]
    },{
      "type": "file",
      "source": "/Users/bobby/.ssh/ukcloudos",
      "destination": "/home/core/.ssh/key.pem"
    }
  ] Given the simplicity of what we're doing, I'm just using shell commands which just updates CoreOS to use the beta channel, and in turn installs the latest Beta build of Docker, along with installing Docker Compose. You'll also notice that we're copying over an ssh key. This is an important piece of the puzzle later on when we need multiple servers to be able to communicate with each other. All you need to do to kick off this build is: $ packer build ./packer/template.json If you now view your images, either using the command line or the control panel, you will see your new image is ready to be consumed. Feel free to create a test instance using this image and type the following command: docker version You will see you are on at least 1.12.1, which includes Swarm. If you'd like to verify Docker Swarm is working, you can type the following command: docker swarm init Hopefully, everything worked perfectly for you. If not, feel free to view the full source code of this example here: https://github.com/UKCloud/openstack-packer/tree/docker-beta 4. Using Terraform to Create Your Infrastructure Yet another tool from Hashicorp, an amazing one, Terraform allows infrastructure to be written as code aka IaC, but not only that, it's Immutable. No matter how many times you execute it, you'll get the same end result. Some other previous tools would be more procedural - take a shell script for example; if you ask the shell script to create 5 servers, and run it 5 times, you'll end up with 25 servers. Terraform is clever, as it maintains state. If you ask it to create 5 servers, it will create 5. Run it again, and it will know you already have 5. Ask it to create 8, it will calculate that you already have 5, and simply add an extra 3. This flexibility is amazing and can be used for magnificent things. All that being said, this is not a Terraform tutorial. This is a tutorial how to make use of Terraform to spin up some Docker Managers and some Docker slaves so that we can deploy our Dummy PHP App. It's probably best to first take a look at the full main.tf file: provider "openstack" {

} Alternatively, you can view the full example on GitHub: https://github.com/UKCloud/openstack-terraform/tree/docker-swarm Creating the First Docker Manager node Assuming you're all good with the basic setup of a network, security groups, floating IP addresses, and routing we'll head straight to the creation of our Docker Swarm. To do this, what we're going to do is create 1 Docker Manager, which will initiate the 'docker swarm init' command. Main.tf ...
data "template_file" "cloudinit" {
    template = "${file("cloudinit.sh")}"
    vars {
        application_env = "dev"
        git_repo = "${var.git_repo}"
        clone_location = "${var.clone_location}"   
    }
}

resource "openstack_compute_instance_v2" "swarm_manager" {
  name            = "swarm_manager_0"
  count = 1

  #coreos-docker-beta
  image_id        = "589c614e-32e5-49ad-aeea-69ebce553d8b"

  flavor_id       = "7d73f524-f9a1-4e80-bedf-57216aae8038"
  key_pair        = "${openstack_compute_keypair_v2.test-keypair.name}"
  security_groups = ["${openstack_compute_secgroup_v2.example_secgroup_1.name}"]

  user_data =  "${data.template_file.cloudinit.rendered}"

  network {
    name        = "${openstack_networking_network_v2.example_network1.name}"
    floating_ip = "${openstack_networking_floatingip_v2.example_floatip_manager.address}"
  }

  provisioner "remote-exec" {
    inline = [
      # Bring up the Swarm!
      "echo 'IP.1 = ${self.network.0.fixed_ip_v4}' > internalip",
      "docker swarm init --advertise-addr ${self.network.0.fixed_ip_v4}",
      "sudo docker swarm join-token --quiet worker > /home/core/worker-token",
      "sudo docker swarm join-token --quiet manager > /home/core/manager-token"
    ]
    connection {
        user = "core"
        host = "${openstack_networking_floatingip_v2.example_floatip_manager.address}"
    }
  }
}
... So, what does this do? It's mostly self explanatory. We're bringing up an instance using the new CoreOS instance, and running a few shell commands. Amongst the shell commands is the swarm init command, which is advertising on the IP address allocated to the machine. The next two commands are the really important ones, though; these are the commands that grab the 'join tokens' that all the other nodes will need to be able to join the swarm. For now, we're saving the tokens to the home directory, so that later nodes can SSH to this server, and grab the tokens (told you there was a reason we needed the SSH key adding to our CoreOS image!). With just this one instance, we have an active swarm, but one that doesn't do a great deal. The next thing we need to do is create the services, and for we're using a template file to make use of the 'cloud init' functionality within OpenStack. The cloud init file looks like this: cloudinit.sh #!/bin/bash
# Script that will run at first boot via Openstack
# using user_data via cloud-init.

docker pull bobbydvo/ukc_nginx:latest
docker pull bobbydvo/ukc_php-fpm:latest
docker network create --driver overlay mynet
docker service create --update-delay 10s --replicas 1 -p 80:80 --network mynet --name web bobbydvo/ukc_nginx:latest
docker service create --update-delay 10s --replicas 1 -p 9000:9000  --network mynet --name php-fpm bobbydvo/ukc_php-fpm:latest

#The above services should be created by the DAB bundle..
#..but Docker 1.13 is changing the work bundles & stacks work so parking for now. This tells the Docker Manager to fire off these commands when it first boots up. If you visit the external IP address at this point, you should see some text like this, "Welcome to your php-fpm Docker container.". This is because our application has not yet been deployed, we'll get to that in a bit. First, we need to create some more Docker Managers, some Docker Slaves, and get them all to join the Swarm! Note: We're initially deploying the base images, as we've not yet configured our Jenkins job to deploy the application. When we get that far, you may want to retrospectively update this cloudinit file with the Docker Image names of the built application name, but it's not essential. Don't worry about it! Adding More Nodes to the Swarm Adding more Docker Managers is now fairly simple, but we can't just increase the count of the first Docker Manager as that has special commands to initiate the Swarm. This second instruction below will allow us to configure as many more managers as we desire. Once up and running, these 'secondary masters' will be no less important than the first Manager, and we will have 3 identical instances with automatic failover. Whilst Docker Swarm doesn't specifically follow the Raft consensus like some other services, having at least three is important, whilst five is strongly recommended in production. This gives Docker Swarm the ability to still function whilst some nodes are out of service for whatever reason. resource "openstack_compute_instance_v2" "swarm_managerx" {
  name            = "swarm_manager_${count.index+1}"
  count           = 2

  #coreos-docker-beta
  image_id        = "589c614e-32e5-49ad-aeea-69ebce553d8b"

  flavor_id       = "7d73f524-f9a1-4e80-bedf-57216aae8038"
  key_pair        = "${openstack_compute_keypair_v2.test-keypair.name}"
  security_groups = ["${openstack_compute_secgroup_v2.example_secgroup_1.name}"]

  user_data       =  "${data.template_file.managerinit.rendered}"

  network {
    name          = "${openstack_networking_network_v2.example_network1.name}"
  }
} The important part now, is to instruct each 'secondary master' to join the swarm as soon as they have booted up. We can do this with another cloud init script. For annotation purposes, I have called this 'managerinit.sh': Managerinit.sh #!/bin/bash
# Script that will run at first boot via Openstack
# using user_data via cloud-init.

sudo scp -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o NoHostAuthenticationForLocalhost=yes -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null -i /home/core/.ssh/key.pem core@${swarm_manager}:/home/core/manager-token /home/core/manager-token
sudo docker swarm join --token $(cat /home/core/manager-token) ${swarm_manager} Due to this being the first time the server will have connected, we're passing a few options to prevent the scp command from prompting any input. Ultimately, though, we're connecting to the 'primary master' to grab the join-tokens that we mentioned earlier in the article. The join tokens are the only way we can ensure we join the correct swarm. The only parameters we are passing in is the IP address to the first Swarm Manager. If you were to execute terraform as-is, without any slaves, and then ssh'd to the floating IP, you could run the following command: docker node ls And you will see a list of the masters, one of which will show it's the leader, whereas the others will show they're *******. Right now, masters will be able to serve your services in just the same way that slaves will be able to in future. In fact, you could just create a Swarm full of Masters if you like! Adding Slaves to the Swarm The code to add more slaves is similar to the masters, only this time the count is coming as an input from the variables.tf file. This is so that we can have as many nodes as we require. resource "openstack_compute_instance_v2" "swarm_slave" {
  name            = "swarm_slave_${count.index}"
  count           = "${var.swarm_node_count}"

  #coreos-docker-beta
  image_id        = "589c614e-32e5-49ad-aeea-69ebce553d8b"

  flavor_id       = "c46be6d1-979d-4489-8ffe-e421a3c83fdd"
  key_pair        = "${openstack_compute_keypair_v2.test-keypair.name}"
  security_groups = ["${openstack_compute_secgroup_v2.example_secgroup_1.name}"]

  user_data =  "${data.template_file.slaveinit.rendered}"

  network {
    name        = "${openstack_networking_network_v2.example_network1.name}"
  }

} The main difference between the slaves and masters is the cloud init file. In the file below, we're doing a number of things: Copying the worker 'join token' from the master. Joining the node into the Docker Swarm. Scaling the active services down to a minimum of 3. Scaling the active services back up to the number of nodes we require. Slaveinit.sh #!/bin/bash
# Script that will run at first boot via Openstack
# using user_data via cloud-init.


sudo scp -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o NoHostAuthenticationForLocalhost=yes -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null -i /home/core/.ssh/key.pem core@${swarm_manager}:/home/core/worker-token /home/core/worker-token
sudo docker swarm join --token $(cat /home/core/worker-token) ${swarm_manager}

# Horrible hack, as Swarm doesn't evenly distribute to new nodes 
# https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/24103
ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o NoHostAuthenticationForLocalhost=yes -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null  -i /home/core/.ssh/key.pem core@${swarm_manager} "docker service scale php-fpm=3"
ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o NoHostAuthenticationForLocalhost=yes -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null  -i /home/core/.ssh/key.pem core@${swarm_manager} "docker service scale web=3"

# Scale to the number of instances we should have once the script has finished.
# This means it may scale to 50 even though we only have 10, with 40 still processing.
# Hence the issue above.
ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o NoHostAuthenticationForLocalhost=yes -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null  -i /home/core/.ssh/key.pem core@${swarm_manager} "docker service scale php-fpm=${node_count}"
ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o NoHostAuthenticationForLocalhost=yes -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null  -i /home/core/.ssh/key.pem core@${swarm_manager} "docker service scale web=${node_count}" The copying of the token and joining the swarm is fairly trivial, and is fairly similar to what happens with the master nodes. What we're also doing though, is issuing a command to the Docker manager to instruct it to scale the service across x nodes. i.e. the number of nodes we are scaling to. Without adding this code here, one would have to scale the infrastructure, and then scale the Docker Service manually. By including this command in the infrastructure as code file, we can simply scale Docker Swarm just from the 'terraform apply' command. Note: As the annotations suggest, the scaling solution here is not so elegant. I will explain more: Suppose we have three Docker Managers and we add three Docker Slaves... as the first Docker Slave is created, it will scale the swarm using the 'docker service scale web=6' command, as can be seen in the code above. However, the moment the first Docker Slave issues that command, we only have four nodes. So we have six containers running on four nodes. Not a big problem, as we're about to add another two Docker Slave nodes. However, when the second and third slave nodes join the swarm, Docker doesn't allocate any services to those nodes. The only way to allocate services to said nodes, is to scale down, and back up again, which is precisely what the code is doing above. Docker is aware of this 'feature' and they are looking at creating a flag to pass onto the Docker Swarm join command to redistribute the services. 5. Deploying the Application We now have three Docker Managers and three Docker Slaves all running in an active Docker Swarm. We can scale up, and we can scale down. This is simply awesome, but not so fun if we don't have our app deployed to test this functionality. To deploy the app we're going to set up a Jenkins job which will be fired either manually or when a commit has been made. The Jenkins job should be configured with the below commands, however, if you don't want to create a Jenkins job, you can always just throw it into a shell script and modify the variables. set -e

DUMMY_VERSION=$BUILD_VERSION
NGINX_VERSION='latest'


sudo docker-compose build 

sudo docker run -i bobbydvo/dummyapp_php-fpm /srv/vendor/bin/phpunit -c /srv/app/phpunit.xml


# tag & push only if all the above succeeded (set -e)
sudo docker tag bobbydvo/dummyapp_php-fpm:latest  bobbydvo/dummyapp_php-fpm:$DUMMY_VERSION
sudo docker push bobbydvo/dummyapp_php-fpm:$DUMMY_VERSION
sudo docker push bobbydvo/dummyapp_php-fpm:latest

ssh core@51.179.219.14 "docker service update --image bobbydvo/dummyapp_php-fpm:$DUMMY_VERSION php-fpm"
ssh core@51.179.219.14 "docker service update --image bobbydvo/ukc_nginx:$NGINX_VERSION web" Note: You will have to ensure that the jenkins user is allowed sudo access What does this job do then? What we're doing is telling docker-compose to execute the docker-compose.yml file that we included in step 2 for our dev environment. This will instruct Docker to build a new Docker container with the latest code, and we then run our unit tests on the newly built container. As we're using the 'set -e' instruction, we'll only continue to the next step if the previous step was successful. With that in mind, if our Unit tests pass, we then tag the latest image and push to Docker hub. The final step is to connect to the Docker Manager and update the service with the latest container. When creating the service, we specified a rolling update of 10s, so as soon as this command is issued, it will take approximately 1 minute for all our nodes to be updated. You can now visit the floating IP that you've allocated to the Docker Manager and you will see that Docker automatically load balances the traffic amongst all the nodes. Simply amazing! 6. Scaling the Application The final step, assuming your application is struggling to cope with the load, is to add more nodes. You can modify the value in the variables.tf: Variables.tf variable "swarm_node_count" {
    default = 10
} And apply! terraform apply Literally that simple. You can scale to 10 nodes, 50 nodes, 1000 nodes, and your application will be automatically load balanced via Docker Swarm. What's better, you know that each and every node running is an exact replica, provisioned in exactly the same way, running the exact same code.

Timothy J. Seppala, @timseppala 23h ago in Transportation Comments 773 Shares Share Tweet Share Save Brendan McDermid / Reuters Perhaps more than any company (with the possible exception of Tesla), Google's autonomous driving record has been under close scrutiny. Today the company bears news that while dramatically increasing the number of miles tested, the number of times a human had to grab the wheel because something went wrong -- "disengagement" -- actually decreased. As Waymo's blog post (and California-DMV-mandated report (PDF)) tells it, these disengagements fell from 0.8 per thousand miles to 0.2 from 2015 to 2016. In 2015 the cars ran 424,331 miles with 341 disengagements, and last year mileage increased to 635,868 while disengagement sharply fell to 124 times. Comparatively, General Motors' Bosch logged 9,895.21 miles and 568 disengagements. Tesla only tested (PDF) in California last October through November and its 550 miles on public streets resulted in 182 disengagements. Waymo says that all of its testing time has taken place on "complex" urban and suburban roads versus testing facilities and that its these conditions that've caused the increase in performance. "This has given us valuable experience sharing the road safely with pedestrians and cyclists," head of Waymo's self-driving tech Dmitri Dolgov writes on Medium. "For each [disengagement] event we can create hundreds -- and sometimes thousands -- of related scenarios in simulation, varying the parameters such as the position and speed of other road users in the area."As Bloomberg notes, however, these tests aren't standardized and because automakers are also logging miles outside of the Golden State, the data isn't anywhere near comprehensive.

The first executive order, dubbed "The rebuilding of the United States Armed Forces," calls for new planes, ships and tools for the US military.

A nine-step vetting system for refugees currently exists in the United States but Trump's executive order, dubbed "Protection of the nation from foreign terrorist entry into the United States," will add new vetting measures to keep out "radical Islamic terrorists." January 28th 2017 6 days ago /video/video.news.com.au/News/ President Donald Trump signed 20 executive orders in his first 10 days in office. Picture: AP Photo/Alex Brandon Charles Firthnews.com.au Share Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on Reddit Email a friend IS WHAT we’re witnessing in the US a slow-motion downhill slide into a coup? A fascinating and scary article has been doing the rounds in recent days, which suggests that Donald Trump’s ban on immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries was an attempt to see how far he can push his power, as the first step to mounting an all-out coup. A Google engineer named Yonatan Zunger has suggested that the way the White House has repeatedly gone around long standing conventions shows it is testing to see whether a coup is possible. One man’s coup is another man’s “strong leadership”. But what Zunger is talking about is Mr Trump’s inner circle grabbing power in a similar way that Vladimir Putin has done in Russia, where he exercises power unchallenged by any other body. Sure, he still has a court system and a legislative body, but they are largely irrelevant, and Mr Putin would ignore them if they ever opposed him. Zunger’s point is that last weekend the White House and Department of Homeland Security happily ignored court orders related to the Muslim ban, and there was no real consequence to it. If Mr Trump’s inner circle gets good at going around the conventional processes, the result is essentially coup-like: Congress and the Supreme Court can try to oppose him all it likes, but if he’s willing to just keep going around the normal processes, there is not a lot they can do. This is normally accompanied by a Kleptocratic approach to the nation’s finances. Kleptocracy is “rule by thieves”. The argument that Zunger presents is that Mr Trump’s refusal to divest himself of assets shows a proclivity to use the office to enrich himself and his family. But coup or not, Zunger has identified some tendencies in Mr Trump’s leadership style are worth exploring. In the weeks since his inauguration, Mr Trump has repeatedly projected his power without being challenged by going around all the normal processes. The most visible — and trivial — example of this is Mr Trump’s use of Twitter. Mr Trump’s tweets about his conversation with Prime Minister ‘Trumble’ stomped on centuries of diplomatic protocol. And he uses Twitter every day to get his message out unchallenged by the questioning (and fact-checking) of the press. Don’t get me wrong — it’s spectacular to watch — but it shows in Mr Trump a desire to be unchallenged and unmediated by the normal processes of government — whether they’re diplomatic protocols or scrutiny by the media. President Donald Trump on the phone to Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull while National Security adviser Michael Flynn and Senior Counsellor to the President Steve Bannon watch on. Picture: Pete Marovich/Consolidated News PhotosSource:AFP If it were just his tweets, that would be one thing, but he’s taking the same approach across the board. Normally, when a President gets into power, he rushes to appoint the roughly 660 senior officials that need approval from Congress. That’s because he’s hoping to get the departments (which employ millions of people) working according to his agenda. Indeed, for centuries, that’s been the main prize of winning the presidency. You get to set the agenda for how millions of Americans administer the government. Instead, Mr Trump only named 29 appointees by the time he was inaugurated. Twenty nine out of 660. In one light, you could argue that this shows that Mr Trump and his inner circle are just deeply incompetent. But you could also consider another possibility — that on the whole, Mr Trump doesn’t care that much about who runs the bureaucracy, because that’s not how he’s planning on projecting his power. It’s now becoming clear that the supposed “mass resignations” of nearly all of the senior staff at the State Department was a purge ordered by the White House. Look at the chart that Emily Gorcenski tweeted around. That’s not an orderly transition. That’s a wipe-out. Here's an updated State Department Org Chart. Blue X's are unfilled appointee positions. Red X's are resignations. pic.twitter.com/gF5p0YGFKC— Emily Roslin v Praze (@EmilyGorcenski) January 26, 2017 Many commentators have lamented the purge means that it will be months — if not years — before the State Department has an effective leadership at the top of it that allows it to participate in Federal policy decisions. But if you follow Zunger’s thinking, perhaps that’s the intention. The purge happened the day before Mr Trump announced his ban on immigration from seven Muslim countries, a ban which many in the State Department would have reflexively opposed. By taking out the State Department, he was able to exercise his power unchallenged. Clearly certain parts of that order were unconstitutional. At least three judges in the US have now ruled against it, and if it ever gets in front of the Supreme Court, there is a case that it breaches the US Constitution’s values of equal protection and religious freedom. But even with a neutered State Department, if Mr Trump had run the Order by the Department of Homeland Security and the Attorney General, the Order would have been neutered out of all its blustery impact. Instead, by going around the normal process of checks and balances, it worked. Sure, various courts around the US ordered stays on some provisions in the Order, but the Order’s intent — to keep people from seven countries from entering the United States — remains in place. By finding ways to exercise power unchallenged, Mr Trump’s inner circle were able to enact an unconstitutional order. And the only lesson that they derived from it is that it actually doesn’t matter how unconstitutional something they do is, as long as they go around the Departments that will object, they can get it done. The list goes on. Mr Trump issued an extraordinary 20 executive orders in his first 10 days. If you read through them, they are hilariously amateurish in their drafting. I know this sounds like a joke, but one of the orders — honestly — declared the day of his inauguration The National Day of Patriotic Devotion. I’m not making it up. The Order itself reads like a decree from Kim Jong Un. We’re not making this stuff up. Picture: US Government Publishing OfficeSource:Supplied As you read through them, it becomes clear they have not gone through the conventional methods for drafting executive orders — which involves showing them to the relevant department for input. At times they are vague, at other times the wording is flowery. They are not the work of experts. The White House has confirmed to multiple reporters that they have been drafted by Mr Trump’s inner circle, and released without any input from the Departments that are expected to carry them out. Again, this might be incompetence — many of his inner circle have no previous experience in government. But it might also be they simply don’t care about what the Departments think about his orders. Or worse, they know exactly what they think, and are seeking ways to avoid that scrutiny. Properly gauging how Mr Trump is exercising his power is important because many of those who oppose Mr Trump are still in a state of denial that he is really behaving in this way. The insider analysis is still largely that the institutions of Congress, the Court System, and even the bureaucratic procedures of the Departments, will place roadblocks around Mr Trump. But what no-one seems to realise is that these institutions are not set up to deal with being circumnavigated, especially not by someone as powerful as a President. And where it starts getting into coup territory is when you realise that he’s even sidelined the US Military from the normal processes in recent weeks. Take, for example, the most powerful body in the US Military hierarchy: the Joint Chiefs of Staff. These are the seven top leaders of all four arms of the military. On Monday, Mr Trump pulled the Joint Chiefs’ representative off the top committee of the National Security Council, and instead appointed his civilian adviser (and far-right nationalist) Steve Bannon to run the committee. Now the military has no permanent member on the committee which directs national security decisions. This is unprecedented. Nobody ever thought that a President would go around the back of a Department or the Military, simply because, being President, the Department and the Military is formally already his to control. But if Mr Trump is prepared to go around his departments and media, ignore diplomatic protocols and sideline the US Military, will he really obey the will of Congress and the Supreme Court when they start trying to put limits on his power? What it means is that much of the conventional thinking about how Mr Trump’s presidency will play out needs to be completely rethought. It’s no use running off to a court to get the President’s order declared unconstitutional if the President plans on ignoring the court’s declaration. It’s no use hoping the military will place roadblocks on his latest National Security plan, because they’re no longer on the committee. The rule book for how power is exercised in the US is currently being torn up. The question is whether what it’s replaced with will be in any way democratic. If the Republicans in Congress try to block Mr Trump from getting his way on something, he’s likely to just go around them. If the past two weeks are any guide, the conventional institutions are unlikely to provide much of a buffer from a President intent on ignoring them. In the meantime, Mr Trump will continue to build parallel institutions, that mean that should the support from all the institutions evaporate, he can still carry on. Consider this: Mr Trump has retained his own private security, rather than relying exclusively on the Secret Service. Indeed, the man who has been head of security for 15 years, Keith Schiller, is now the head of Oval Office operations. This has never happened before. The US Secret Service has an institutional imperative to protect the President, regardless of what happens. Of course, if all the institutions did turn against President Trump, and it became murky about who the legitimate President was, who knows how the US Secret Service would react. Which makes having your own people on the ground quite useful, doesn’t it? Charles Firth majored in Economic (Social Science) at Sydney University. He is also editor of The Chaser Quarterly.

Skip to content MilTech pr@satprnews.com HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Main Menu Microsoft, Google and IBM Surge in Public Cloud is at Expense of Smaller Providers 3 February 2017Military News RENO, Nev., Feb. 02, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — New Q4 data from Synergy Research Group shows that Amazon Web Services (AWS) is maintaining its dominant share of the burgeoning public cloud services market at over 40%, while the three main chasing cloud providers – Microsoft, Google and IBM – are gaining ground but at the expense of smaller players in the market. In aggregate the three have increased their worldwide market share by almost five percentage points over the last year and together now account for 23% of the total public IaaS and PaaS market, helped by particularly strong growth at Microsoft and Google. The next ten cloud providers in the ranking have slipped off the pace a little, though this group does include Alibaba and Oracle who continue to grow at impressive rates. There is then a very long tail of small-to-medium sized cloud service providers, whose collective market share has now dropped to just 18%. A photo accompanying this announcement is available at http://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/2429ad15-6ee9-401a-ad09-e998578c6193    With most of the major operators having now released their earnings data for Q4, Synergy estimates that quarterly public cloud infrastructure service revenues (including both public IaaS and public PaaS) have now reached well over $7 billion and continue to grow at almost 50% per year. If managed private cloud services are included, quarterly cloud revenues are now well over $9 billion. The cloud providers and rankings are very different in the managed private cloud, where IBM continues to lead while Rackspace and traditional IT service providers feature more prominently than they do in public cloud. “While a few cloud providers are growing at extraordinary rates, AWS continues to impress as a dominant market leader that has no intention of letting its crown slip,” said John Dinsdale, a Chief Analyst and Research Director at Synergy Research Group. “Achieving and maintaining a leadership position in this market takes huge ongoing investments in infrastructure, a continued expansion in the range of cloud services offered, strong credibility with the large enterprise sector, consistently strong execution, and the wholehearted and long-term backing of senior management. AWS is checking all of those boxes and any serious challengers need to do likewise.” About Synergy Research Group Synergy provides quarterly market sizing and segmentation data on cloud and related markets, including company revenues by segment and by region.

Having sidled up to King Donald in New York City before he took over as US president, tech CEOs have stayed mostly quiet during two of the most tumultuous weeks in recent US political history. To be fair, a few top execs posted carefully worded statements on their websites while citizens protested against Trump's crackdown on Muslim immigrants. Thanks for your opinions, powerful rich people. However, now that the White House is planning to shake up the H-1B visa program, which tech companies are heavily reliant on to get skilled-slash-cheaper workers into the country, funnily enough we're seeing a slightly more vigorous response. A draft of a letter, addressed to President Trump, that is making the rounds among tech giants on America's West Coast makes some brief allusions to American values before getting down to business: "As entrepreneurs and business leaders, our ability to grow our companies and create jobs depends on the contributions of immigrants from all backgrounds." The letter takes a softball approach and goes out of its way not to condemn the president's executive order, noting that the tech giants "share your goal of ensuring that our immigration system meets today's security needs and keeps our country safe," and that they "welcome the changes your administration has made in recent days." The companies will also "help your administration identify other opportunities to ensure that our employees can travel with predictability and without undue delay." All the best words In fact, most of the letter reads as though the tech CEOs actually agree with the controversial order to ban people from certain countries from entering the country: it concludes by asking Trump to "use us as a resource to help achieve immigration policies that both support the work of American businesses and reflect American values." The strongest criticism of the order – which sparked thousands to protest in person at airports across the country and saw an unprecedented dissent memo from the State Department – comes in a single mealy-mouthed sentence that says "while security and vetting procedures can and should always be subject to continuous evaluation and improvement, a blanket suspension is not the right approach." In contrast to the strong, principled stance taken by Microsoft's president Brad Smith on the issue of the federal authorities trying to access people's private data on servers held outside the United States, on Thursday Smith went out of his way not to question the dubious morals or legality of Trump's immigration executive order and instead asked for special favors for Microsoft. "The President expressly gave to the Secretaries of State and Homeland Security the authority to grant exceptions on a case-by-case basis," Smith notes in an official blog post, adding: "Today Microsoft is filing a formal request asking these cabinet officers to create a process to grant exceptions that will permit 'Responsible Known Travelers with Pressing Needs' to re-enter the country while protecting the nation's security." Smith has even drafted language that would make it easier for Microsoft and similar tech companies to get their workers in the country – while leaving the hundreds of thousands of other likely affected individuals to their own devices. And just to make sure the president hears it from the horse's mouth, Smith used Trump's favorite medium and his daily tweet to link to the post with the message: "Amid the broader debate on immigration, a practical proposal to address the hardship faced by some people today." Bottom line The reality is that Silicon Valley and the broader tech industry are highly reliant on non-US citizens to stay competitive. Thanks to the concentration of big tech companies in California, it is a highly valued destination for workers, especially coders, from all over the world – and the United States' educational system simply does not provide enough of them to handle demand. Every big tech company has several people in the HR department dedicated to nothing but working the US visa program and getting individuals in. They often know government immigration officials on first-name terms due to the constant and high-volume rate of communication. The recent "Muslim ban" has already had an impact: Microsoft's Smith notes that 76 employees were immediately affected. Likewise, Google. It started immediately flying its people back into the country when it heard about the executive order. That problem would grow exponentially, however, if Trump decided to carry out his threat to change the H1-B worker visa program and so force more companies to "hire American." And while several CEOs – notably Google's Sergey Brin and Apple's Tim Cook – have made plain their personal views on Trump's order, others have stayed notably quiet. Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg, who wrote an entire book about women having the confidence to lead, was asked on stage on Wednesday about her failure to attend or mention the Women's March the day after Trump's inauguration. "I just felt bad that I couldn't be there," she responded. "And, once I felt bad, I felt like I couldn't say anything." In recent days, tech companies have made big play about the money they are donating to causes supporting immigration. But in each case it has been the companies' own employees that have forced the issue, with the companies promising to match the funds that they put forward. Tech leaders seem to get this wrong a lot: It’s ok to use an economic argument to support a point, but the core must be the moral argument. — Anil Dash (@anildash) February 2, 2017 In a country where corporations are legally viewed as people and persistently promote themselves as individuals, with personal views on everything from social issues like gay marriage to congratulating individuals (one recent note: Beyonce's twins and whatever this is from Popeye's Chicken), the sad truth is that the largest and most powerful companies in the world have decided that it is not in their best interests to upset the notoriously petty and thin-skinned Donald Trump, even when his actions go against their and their employees' moral and ethical values. But hit em where it hurts – the wallet – and Big Tech will do everything it can... to carve out special exceptions for itself. ® Breaking: Uber CEO Travis Kalanick has quit Trump's economic advisory board. That board included "Elon Musk (CEO of Tesla), Mary Barra (Chairwoman/CEO of General Motors), Indra Nooyi (Chairwoman/CEO of Pepsi), Ginni Rometty (Chairwoman/CEO of IBM), Bob Iger (Chairman/CEO of Disney), Jack Welch (former Chairman of GE) and a dozen other business leaders," according to Kalanick.

It didn't turn out the way many of us, and the signees, expected. Here's a look at the 10 Trojans who came to USC as a big part of that class. We'll look at their story here. So whatever happened to . . . what's-his-name, you know the guy? How often we've heard that, especially when it comes to recruits from the good old days. But whoever actually goes out, even in this day of Google, and tracks them all down. Well, The Washington Post did. Reporter Rick Maese tracked down nearly every single one of the Rivals.com's Top 100 from the 2007 class, one that USC's Trojans dominated with 10 Top 100 players and a final team ranking of No. 2 behind only Florida, something trumpeted on USCFootball.com, a member of the Rivals network then, But before we get into the USC details, how about some of the overall findings in Maese's story, which we strongly recommend you read here. It's an outstanding example of what great newspapers can and should do. Here are the numbers Maese found. A mere 39 of the 100 were drafted by the NFL. USC didn't quite make that four in 10 standard. Just three of the Trojans in the 2007 Top 100 class heard their name called. But four Trojans were among the nation's top 11 prospects, five of the top 17. An amazing performance for a USC class whose 4.22 star average was far and away the best in the nation and only one above 4.00. And in what seems like a prehistoric time, Alabama finished No. 10 in the nation with Michigan (No. 12), Oklahoma (No. 14), Ohio State (No. 15) and Clemson (No. 16) all relegated to the second 10 in team rankings.    A total of 20 are still in the NFL this season and seven made the Pro Bowl. One of those -- Everson Griffen -- is a Trojan. Four are dead -- including one Trojan -- Joe McKnight, the No. 2 player in the nation that year, who was shot and killed tragically in a road rage incident in his native New Orleans last month. Only a third of the Top 100 earned degrees at the school where they signed although for these Trojans, it appears that more than half have earned their USC degrees. And yes, there were some very famous names in this class, Maese notes, who have ended up in very different places. No. 28 Cam Newton won the Heisman and was an NFL MVP. No. 54 was Dallas Cowboy Dez Bryant. And No. 66, Aaron Hernandez, is in prison for life for murder. And one of them, a USC favorite whose No. 1 ranking maybe should have been a tipoff about this class, was from Southern California on his way to Notre Dame -- quarterback Jimmy Clausen. If that wasn't an uh-oh moment, it should have been. Just one stat for Clausen's NFL career that Maese reports. He started 14 games in six seasons throwing twice as many interceptions as touchdowns. Here are the USC 10 with italicized profiles from The Washington Post followed by our comments.  2. Joe McKnight, RB "A fourth-round pick by the Jets in 2010, McKnight struggled to find a steady role in the NFL. He spent 2016 in the CFL and was killed in December in an apparent road-rage incident."  The real tragedy of that class for the USC family and the McKnight family. A young man whose life so often came close to living up to his promise and then something always seemed to happen that took him in the other direction. Sad beyond belief.  6. Everson Griffen, DE "The Vikings' fourth-round pick in 2010, Griffen has twice made the Pro Bowl and has started 48 games in seven seasons." Gifted beyond belief, but an athlete not many Trojan fans were sure could stay on the path to becoming a Pro Bowl player. Much credit to EG for doing so. 8. Ronald Johnson, WR "A sixth-round pick in 2011, Johnson bounced around to a few teams but never caught an NFL pass. He tried the CFL and spent last season in the American Indoor Football League." One of our favorite people to come this way, the first RoJo just didn't quite have the skill set to make it at the next level, especially those hands that betrayed him on that would-have-been-game-winning catch at the end of the Notre Dame game in 2010. 11. Chris Galippo, LB "His college career was slowed by injuries, and he lost his starting job as a senior. According to a LinkedIn profile, he worked at a drug and alcohol treatment center." This was the star-crossed class and Chris was the poster boy for it. Before his several back surgeries, the Chris Galippo in high school all-star games was a middle linebacking beast beyond belief. Pretty remarkable effort by Chris to keep playing the way he did with a back in the shape his was in. 17. Marc Tyler, RB "Tyler never heard his name called in the 2012 draft. He signed a free agent deal with the Packers but didn't last long." But for that 2011 team that finished so strong, Marc provided much of the drive carrying the ball behind Matt Kalil and Rhett Ellison. But the personable Tyler never seemed to have a handle on his weight -- or his injuries. Next, in one of the longer and more interesting profiles in the story, comes USC's Kris O'Dowd, the No. 29 prospect overall. Here it is: 29. Kris O’Dowd, C O'Dowd suffered his share of injuries in college — shoulder, knees — but still felt he had done enough to impress NFL teams. His life always had been pointed toward a football career, and he had hoped to hear his name in the first round of the draft, maybe the second. But all seven rounds passed, and O'Dowd never heard his name called . . . “I remember just sitting there, my dreams totally crushed,” he recalled. “It turned out I failed an MRI at the combine.” He had earned his bachelor’s degree in three years at USC but still had no Plan B. “I had been focused completely on football. I put all my chips in one pile, and I busted,” he said. “I fell on my ass.” A year-long depression followed. He leaned heavily on a network of USC alumni but went through seven months of interviews before securing a job offer. He used the same ambition and work ethic from his football days to rise up the ladder. He now splits his time between Los Angeles and Dubai, is a partner with an international cryogenics company, in addition to working with a truffle farm in Italy and a telecommunications cloud company.“It took me a while to restructure myself, physically, mentally, confidence-wise,” Dowd said. . . . “Football was something I was good at, but it wasn’t who I am,” he said. “I’m meant for something special in this world, and I’m really looking forward to whatever that is." The first true freshman to start at center for USC, it did appear that the brainy O'Dowd was on his way. And then one injury after another took him down. And it was tough for Kris, who had to find his way without the game. That he did, that he fell back on his USC education and network to work his way out of it, and is now well on his way is the way we can only hope these stories always end.  44. Aaron Corp, QB "Stuck behind Mark Sanchez and Matt Barkley, Corp transferred to Richmond after three seasons. After failing to catch on in the NFL, he turned to coaching and is on the staff at Norfolk State." A badly handled transition in the Pete Carroll Era cost pretty much everybody involved for the quarterback to follow Carson Palmer, Matt Leinart and John David Booty. Tough spot for Corp, who was under terrific pressure but not in the talent class of those who came before him, or after, to step into.  48. DaJohn Harris, DT "Harris tried the Arena League after failing to stick with an NFL team. He returned to school to finish his public policy degree and was recently pursuing his master's in social work at USC, according to LinkedIn." We're happy for DaJohn and the way he's continuing his education. The Serra alum and Inglewood resident had to overcome the late diagnosis of a small hole in his heart that kept him out of the Combine before making it as one of two rookies on the Titans before moving on to the Redskins and then the Arena League. 75. Martin Coleman, OL "Coleman battled injuries but lasted five years at USC. He never caught on in the NFL but in 2013 earned his degree in American studies and ethnicity." The Huntington Beach lineman had all the tools and none of the good fortune to be able to use them. One of those All-Airport-Team guys who if only his health could have been as good as his body looked in uniform. 92. Marshall Jones, DB "Jones played four years at USC and earned his degree in public policy. He is now an investment associate with a commercial real estate brokerage firm." The Oaks Christian grad from Agoura Hills never quite got to the level he'd been projected but he was on the field between corner and safety in four of his five years thanks to an injury redshirt he was granted.

But before we get there, we need rules to ensure that, at the most fundamental level, we're developing AI responsibly and safely. At a recent gathering, a group of experts did just that, coming up with 23 principles to steer the development of AI in a positive direction — and to ensure it doesn't destroy us. Image: Anthony Hopkins in Westworld. The new guidelines, dubbed the 23 Asilomar AI Principles, touch upon issues pertaining to research, ethics and foresight — from research strategies and data rights to transparency issues and the risks of artificial superintelligence. Previous attempts to establish AI guidelines, including efforts by the IEEE Standards Association, Stanford University's AI100 Standing Committee and even the White House, were either too narrow in scope, or far too generalised. The Asilomar principles, on the other hand, pooled together much of the current thinking on the matter to develop a kind of best practices rulebook as it pertains to the development of AI. The principles aren't yet enforceable, but are meant to influence the way research is done moving forward. Artificial intelligence is at the dawn of a golden era, as witnessed by the emergence of digital personal assistants like Siri, Alexa and Cortana; self-driving vehicles; and algorithms that exceed human capacities in meaningful ways (in the latest development, an AI defeated the world's best poker players). But unlike many other tech sectors, this area of research isn't bound by formal safety regulations or standards, leading to concerns that AI could eventually go off the rails and become a burden instead of a benefit. Common fears include AI replacing human workers, disempowering us and becoming a threat to our very existence. To address these and other issues, the Future of Life Institute recently brought together dozens of experts to come up with a set of core principles to nudge AI development in positive directions and steer us clear of apocalypse scenarios. Attendees of the conference came from diverse backgrounds, including engineers, programmers, roboticists, physicists, economists, philosophers, ethicists and legal scholars. The 23 Asilomar AI Principles have since been endorsed by nearly 2300 people, including 880 robotics and AI researchers. Notable supporters include physicist Stephen Hawking, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, futurist Ray Kurzweil and Skype co-founder Jaan Tallinn. Experts converse over a meal at the Asilomar conference. (Image: FLI) "Our hope was — and will be going forward — to involve a very diverse set of stakeholders, but also to ground the process in the expert knowledge of the AI developers who really understand what systems are being developed, what they can do, and where they may be going," noted participant Anthony Aguirre, a physicist at the University of California, Santa Cruz. Discussions were often contentious during the conference, but a high level of consensus eventually emerged. To set a high bar, the FLI organisers only accepted a principle if at least 90 per cent of the attendees agreed with it. The principles were organised into three sections — research issues, ethics and values, and longer-term issues. Under research, principles included the need to create "beneficial intelligence" as opposed to "undirected intelligence" (more on this in just a bit), and an admonition for AI developers to maintain a healthy dialogue with policy-makers. Ethics and values included the need to ensure safety at all stages of AI development, the instilling of human values into a machine mind, the avoidance of an AI arms race and the need to maintain human control. Long-term considerations included risk assessments, control measures and adherence to the so-called "capability caution" — a warning that we should never underestimate the potential power of advanced AI. “To think AI merely automates human decisions is like thinking electricity is just a replacement for candle.” Patrick Lin, a conference attendee and the director of the Ethics + Emerging Sciences Group at California Polytechnic State University, says the Asilomar AI principles sprung from "a perfect storm of influences" he hadn't encountered before. "This was a standard-setting exercise in a field that has no cohesive identity, making the exercise much more difficult," he told Gizmodo. While perfect consensus was not expected, everyone at the conference could agree that AI is going to be impactful in ways we've never seen before. "To think AI merely automates human decisions is like thinking electricity is just a replacement for candles," Lin said. "Given the massive potential for disruption and harm, as well as benefits, it makes sense to establish some norms early on to help steer research in a good direction, as opposed to letting a market economy that's fixated mostly on efficiency and profit to shape AI." Asilomar group photo. List of attendees can be found here. (Image: FLI) Some of the items on the list are a bit of a no-brainer, such as the need to avoid an AI arms race and to ensure safety. But other items, though simply stated, are considerably more complex. Take the injunction to develop "beneficial intelligence". It's vague, but Aguirre says that's a strength at this early juncture. "We hope people will interpret it in many ways," he told Gizmodo. "The crucial aspect of this principle, as I see it, is that benefit is part of the equation. That is, AI developers are actively thinking about what the ramifications of the tools they are developing might be, rather than just making the tools better, stronger, and faster." Another complicated issue is the one about maintaining human control. According to this principle, Humans should choose how and whether to delegate decisions to AI systems, to accomplish human-chosen objectives. The trouble is, AI is becoming increasingly better and more efficient at many tasks, making us more inclined to offload those responsibilities. Today, for example, algorithms have taken over as our stock traders. There's concern that battlefield robots will eventually be "taken out of the loop" and given the autonomy to kill enemy combatants of their own accord. Aguirre says we will cede some decisions to AI systems, but we should do so with care. "I already listen to Google Maps, for example, which helps me decide what route to take through traffic," said Aguirre. "But recently I was caught in a mudslide-caused traffic jam for an hour with zero movement, while Google doggedly informed me it was a 48 minute trip. I eventually ignored the instructions and drove home a very roundabout way that saved me hours." He says it's important that we keep our eye on what decisions we are delegating and which ones we really want to keep for ourselves. Many of the principles on the new list fall into the "easier said than done" category. For instance, there's an injunction for AI developers to be open and transparent about their research. Given the high degree of competition in the tech sector, that seems like a pipe dream. Aguirre agrees it's an important and difficult issue. "One positive sign is the partnership on AI, envisaged in part as a group that can create collaborative dynamics where the benefit of participating counter the competitive 'cost' of sharing information," he said. "While big advances may come from scrappy little startups with small resources, thus far much of the real advance has been in powerhouses like Google/Deepmind, IBM, Facebook, etc." In terms of getting developers to comply with these principles, Lin says people tend to have a hard time understanding the value of norms, leading to calls for the "fangs of law". Failure to disclose security faults in an AI, for example, could lead to stiff fines and penalties. "Even without the teeth of legal punishment, norms are still powerful in shaping behaviour, whether it's at home, or in the classroom, or in international relations," Lin said. "For instance, the US is not a signatory to the Ottawa Treaty that bans anti-personnel landmines. But we still abide by it anyway, because breaking such a strong norm has severe political and therefore economic consequences. The global condemnation that would follow is enough of a deterrent (so far)." But this might not always be the case, requiring strict — and even international-level — oversight. It isn't impossible to imagine a company like Facebook or Google developing a superintelligent AI that can simultaneously boosts profits to unprecedented levels and pose a catastrophic threat to humanity. With profits soaring, a big company might not care about violating "norms" and having to face global condemnation. Alarmingly, we have no provision for this sort of thing. Another principle that will be hard, if not impossible, to implement is the one stating that: AI systems should be designed and operated so as to be compatible with ideals of human dignity, rights, freedoms, and cultural diversity. This concept, known as "value alignment", is an often-cited strategy to keep AI safe, but there's no universally agreed-upon way to define a "human value". Lin agrees that value alignment is a particularly thorny problem. "At Asilomar, there was a lot of talk about aligning AI with human values, but little discussion of what these human values are," he said. "Technologists understandably are uncomfortable confronting this prior question, but it's an essential one. If you have a perfectly aligned AI [that is, an AI perfectly aligned with human values] but calibrated to the wrong human values, then you just unleashed a terrible technology or even weapon." As a classic (but extreme) example, an AI could be told that making lots of paperclips is good — and it proceeds to turn the entire planet into paperclips. As Lin fears, a seemingly innocuous value could pose a serious threat. “If we envision a time when AIs exist that are as capable or more so than the smartest humans, it would be utterly naive to believe that the world will not fundamentally change.” Finally, there's the issue of artificial intelligence as an existential threat. On that topic, the Asilomar guidelines speak to the importance of overseeing any machine capable of recursive self-improvement (that is, the ability of an AI to continually improve its own source code, leading to a potential "run away" effect, or program itself with a set of features that run contrary to human values). The challenge there will be in implementing the required safeguards, and ensuring that the machine stays "in bounds" when it comes to certain modifications. This is not going to be easy. A final important item on the list is the "capability caution". Given that there's no consensus on how powerful AI might become, it would be wise to refrain from making grand proclamations about its maximum potential. In other words, we should never, ever, underestimate the power of artificial superintelligence. "No current AI system is going to 'go rogue' and be dangerous, and it's important that people know that," Aguirre said. "At the same time, if we envision a time when AIs exist that are as capable or more so than the smartest humans, it would be utterly naive to believe that the world will not fundamentally change. So how seriously we take AI's opportunities and risks has to scale with how capable it is, and having clear assessments and forecasts — without the press, industry or research hype that often accompanies advances — would be a good starting point." For now, this list of principles is just that — a list of principles. There's no provision to have these guidelines enforced or updated, nor is there any call for institutional or governmental oversight. As it stands, developers can violate these best-of-breed recommendations, and face no consequences. So will these 32 principles keep us safe and protect us from an AI apocalypse? Probably not, but the purpose of this exercise was to pool together the best ideas on the matter in hopes of inspiring something more concrete. As imperfect and idealistic as these principles may be, we're better off having them.

Print   Email   Font Resize Court date in fatal motorcycle crash set for Feb. 7 Ronald Saldivar was killed on final ride before selling bike By Jennifer Rios Staff Writer Posted:   02/02/2017 03:22:18 PM MST Ronald Saldivar, Jr. (Courtesy Photo / Saldivar Family) Ronald Saldivar wanted to start a life in Broomfield with his wife. The 28-year-old moved to the area last August for a job in the Google offices in Boulder, and while checking out nearby cities, fell in love with Broomfield. His death Oct. 27 shocked his family, who were left devastated and wondering about the court case that accompanied the fatal crash. That morning, he had gone for a ride on his motorcycle "He was actually going to sell his motorcycle that day," his cousin Consuelo Carrillo said. "He was taking it on one last drive." Bradford Pigors, 67, was heading west on Uptown Avenue in his pickup truck and had stopped in the left turn lane waiting to turn south onto Wadsworth Boulevard, according to the crash report. Saldivar was eastbound on Uptown on his Kawasaki Ninja approaching the Parkland Street/Wadsworth intersection when Pigors turned left in front of Saldivar as he entered the intersection. The two hit head on. Saldivar was taken to Good Samaritan Medical Center in Lafayette and later died. Pigors has been charged with careless driving resulting in death. He has a disposition scheduled for 1:30 p.m. Feb. 7. Saldivar was cremated and taken to California for a funeral service — the day after what would have been his 29th birthday. Advertisement "He was donor." Carrillo said. "There is someone who is seeing today because of him. He donated his eyes and skin." Chelsea, Saldivar's wife of 15 months, chose to stay in Broomfield because it was their happiest time as a couple. Her family later joined her. Saldivar was raised by his grandmother in San Jose while his mother served in the U.S. Marines. Saldivar was the eldest of nine grandchildren, Carrillo said, and was an easy-going child. She and her sister were incredibly close to him in age and relationship, she said considered him a brother. He also was the oldest of five other siblings. He loved cars and computers growing up, Carrillo said, from playing with Hot Wheels as a boy, to wanting to study vehicles as an adult. Saldivar became interested in cyber security and worked for different companies before coming to Colorado. He didn't want to live in Boulder since it was a college town, but signed a lease on an apartment in Arista. His friends, who shared his love of craft beer, decided to keep plans they made with Saldivar and made the trip to Colorado for a brewery tour recently. At each location, they brought along a picture of their friend. "He would make you think 'can I be better? Can I be more positive?' That was the really incredible thing about him," Carrillo said.

Andy KrollFeb. 2, 2017 9:32 PM Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Email Jeff Chiu/AP More than 30 CEOs at the nation's largest tech companies—including Google, Facebook, Apple, Microsoft, and Uber—have signed onto a letter criticizing President Donald Trump's executive order temporarily banning all refugees and citizens of seven of Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States. A source involved in drafting the letter provided the current list of signatories to Mother Jones. The letter, still in draft form, is set to be released and delivered to the White House on Monday, according to the source. "We share your goal of ensuring that our immigration system meets today's security needs and keeps our country safe," the letter reads. "We are concerned, however, that your recent Executive Order will affect many visa holders who work hard here in the United States and contribute to our country's success." The letter goes on to suggest that Trump's order—which has sparked protests around the country and the world and prompted criticism from American and international companies—could make it more difficult for tech firms to recruit talented workers from around the world: "In a global economy, it is critical that we continue to attract the best and brightest from around the world. We welcome the changes your administration has made in recent days in how the Department of Homeland Security will implement the Executive Order, and we stand ready to help your administration identify other opportunities to ensure that our employees can travel with predictability and without undue delay." The letter also criticizes the Trump administration's decision to enact an outright travel ban—presently at 120 days for refugees, 90 days for citizens of Iraq, Iran, Sudan, Syria, Libya, Somalia, and Yemen, and indefinitely for Syrian refugees—as opposed to a more measured restriction. "While security and vetting procedures can and should always be subject to continuous evaluation and improvement, a blanket suspension is not the right approach," the letter reads. The executives who've signed the letter represent many of the most prominent and powerful companies in the tech industry. Other companies who joined the letter, according to the source, include Twitter, eBay, PayPal, Netflix, and Dropbox. None of the companies mentioned in this story immediately responded to requests for comment. The technology sector, more than most domestic industries, relies on highly skilled immigrants for its workforce. A 2016 study by the National Foundation for American Policy reported that 51 percent of US-based start-ups that were valued at $1 billion or more had been founded by immigrants. In recent years, Zuckerberg and other tech leaders have sunk millions of dollars into lobbying and political campaigning to convince Congress to pass comprehensive immigration reform. Those efforts have all failed.  And the Trump administration appears more inclined to further restrict immigration and refugee resettlement in the US rather than expand it. The president's top adviser, Stephen Bannon, is a longtime foe of immigration reform and open borders. "Why even let 'em in?" Bannon asked on his radio show in November 2015. "Can't that money be used in the United States? Should we just take a pause and a hiatus for a number of years on any influx from that area of the world?"

The company is not yet profitable; in fact it lost a whopping $514.6 million last year. One interesting tidbit in the filing is that Snapchat entered into a contract with Google just a few days ago on Jan. 30. Specifically, the company will be using the Google Cloud platform for at least five years, and will pay Google $400 million a year for that privilege, for a total of $2 billion. The contract is not quite exclusive as Snapchat does have the right to use other companies for some of its cloud services. Even with this contract in place, the filing admits that development of Snapchat apps gets more attention on iOS than Android, simply because the app itself is more popular on Apple’s platform. The filing also mentions that Spectacles will be sold more widely in the future. The camera sunglasses, which record short video clips that can be sent directly to the Snapchat app, were launched in late 2016 in a popup store in New York City and in a vending machine that toured the country. Today, Snap said it will “significantly broaden the distribution of Spectacles” in the future, but specifics were not revealed. The company says that it will officially go public sometime in March, and hopes to raise $3 billion with the IPO, which would make Snap itself valued at over $20 billion.

Price $499 AUD > Pricing info Tweet Email this Print this Feedback Gives you a taste of Augmented Reality, but not much more We all want our smartphones filled with groundbreaking tech - but that can either be the kind that's perfect for everyday use, or something that isn't quite as useful, but demonstrates plenty of potential to bridge a technological gap in our lives.  Lenovo's Phab2 Pro falls into the latter category. It's the world's first smartphone with Project Tango, Google's foray into Augmented Reality (AR). Wait. Haven't we seen this all before? Well, yes and no. It sounds a lot like the setup you'll find in Dell's Venue 8 7000 tablet. That used an Intel RealSense camera setup, and could do clever stuff like measuring objects just by pointing the lens at them. Lenovo's version fits in your pocket, but is the Phab2 Pro just as gimmicky - or does it do enough to make us rethink how we use AR? POWER ME UP For such cutting edge tech, the Phab2 Pro is a surprisingly affordable US$499. Just keep in mind that it only has the guts of a mid-range phone, though. There's a Snapdragon 652 CPU running the show, paired with 4GB of RAM. It's an octa-core chip, but clock speeds aren't the highest - which begs the question: is the Phab2 Pro underpowered? With modest Geekbench scores of 1474 (single-core) and 3540 (multi-core), it gets the job done on paper. In real world use too, the phone is zippy enough to get you through your daily routine without any noticeable lag or slowdown. Loading up a Tango-enabled app does, however, feel a little on the slow side. The experience is generally fine once you're using it though, so we're not too worried. 3D models are rendered quickly enough and it doesn't feel too sluggish, albeit barely – but more on that later. On first impressions at least, it doesn't give me the confidence that the next generation of apps will run smoothly on it. You get 64GB of on-board storage, and there's a microSD card slot too, so you won't run out of space in a hurry. Like most other phones, though, the slot also accommodates a second SIM card, meaning that it's shared. Pretty standard fare here. THE INCREDIBLE BULK Performance aside, the Phab2 Pro otherwise feels like a premium phone. It's certainly quite well-made. There's nary a flaw on its body, and they took the effort to chamfer and polish the edges perfectly, even on the USB port – now that's premium-level effort for you. The 6.4in, 2560x1440 display certainly adds to the upmarket feel, and it's a real visual treat. Lenovo has picked an LCD panel, so while contrast and black levels won't rival OLED screens from Samsung, it still looks sharp and has great viewing angles. Dolby Atmos is along for the ride, too, tweaking the sound EQ and letting you record multi-channel audio using the built-in microphones. The external speaker is loud and clear as well. However, the ergonomics, size and weight aren't quite singing the same song.  Nothing can disguise the fact that this is a rather bulky and heavy phone - I couldn't change volume and then use the fingerprint sensor without changing my grip first. You just can't reach it all, and it slides off non-flat surfaces easily when you put it down. It would be tricky to make the phone any slimmer though, seeing as it's packed with cameras and sensors. You get an RGB camera, a time-of-flight camera, a motion-tracking camera, and an IR depth sensor, in addition to the usual array of motion sensors to make Tango possible.  The large, 4050mAh battery probably didn't help, either - but it does let you go for well over a day between charges. Stay away from power-intensive apps, and the Tango AR modes, and you'll be waking up on day three with a small amount of juice left. STANDARD SNAPPER If I'm honest, I wasn't expecting much from the Phab2 Pro's main camera. A 16MP sensor and phase detection autofocus should do a respectable job, so with those expectations in mind, I wasn't disappointed. You get decent enough results in daylight, but things aren't so great at night.  However, you should note that it struggles to focus when lighting conditions aren't optimal, so you have to be selective about your subject matter and composition. You'll have a better time if you choose a clear focal point, or compose the picture so that it's not difficult for the autofocus to figure out what you want to do. Image quality is decent enough, provided you have the right amount of light. In low light, the algorithm is rather heavy-handed; while the images aren't grainy at all, it does come at the cost of detail.  Despite the camera-heavy nature of the Phab2 Pro, it seems that the photography element wasn't quite high on the agenda. Its focus speed of 0.3 seconds was touted as a feature, but in practice, it felt no faster than most cameras. TWO TO TANGO If there's any reason to get this phone, it has got to be Tango. At the time of writing, 25 free Tango-enabled apps are available, along with eight paid-for ones. They run the gamut of genres, from racing games, first-person experiential apps, and amusing ones like Holo, where you simply place modelled characters into your environment. In all honesty, not all apps are useful, although they do show the sheer potential of what is to come. The ones that best help you appreciate the benefits of AR are the simple ones like Measure, a virtual tape measure that can give a relatively decent approximation through the cameras. Apps like Lowe's Vision and iStaging let you virtually place furniture around your house before you buy (if you live in the US, anyway) so you can have an idea of whether they'll fit, or suit the decor. Tango needs more apps like Matterport Scenes. It's easily the most futuristic of the apps available at the moment, with its ability to scan an entire room and all its items and save it as a 3D model that you can use for measurements. What's killer is that it's so easy to use: no elaborate techniques are needed, and the app gives easy steps to follow if you miss out something during your scan. However, this is also very taxing on the phone. Remember when we mentioned earlier that the hardware was okay for the most part? Well, this is one instance where you can see it struggling, as the scanning slows to a crawl and the frame rates drop. The fact that it's struggling for an app that can justify Tango's relevance isn't very encouraging. Not to mention that the battery drains a fair bit quicker as well. Games are undoubtedly part of the charm, although, in this case, aren't as compelling as they should be, yet. You'll certainly have some fun moments creating over-the-top race tracks in Wild Wild Race as you challenge the limits of your creativity, designing a race track that zig-zags around your furnishings, but it's an idea that's sexier than the execution. Others like Phantogeist are a little more successful at assimilating your surroundings into the gameplay action, largely thanks to a more polished game mechanic, but ultimately the idea of AR applications (and games) hinges on how important it is to you to bring your surroundings into play, so to speak. It's the apps, more so than the hardware, which will determine if a platform like Tango grows and succeeds. Perhaps it's good that Lenovo made the Phab2 Pro affordable, so you won't be left high and dry if the worst case scenario happens and app support simply never shows up. LENOVO PHAB2 PRO VERDICT So would we recommend the Phab2 Pro? Only if you love and believe in AR that much. Apps still need work, and it's anyone's guess as to how they'll improve in the next year. If the existing hardware struggles now, it might keel over when more advanced stuff shows up - so it's a leap of faith on that account right now. From what we've seen, you probably need more processing power and a bigger battery, or at least one that charges quickly. If you take AR out of the equation, the Phab2 Pro loses its sheen. While the build quality and parts are on the level of a great mid-tier phone, the size and ergonomics are rather difficult to get around. The 2K 6.4-inch display is a plus, but there's no compelling plus point outside of AR, which frankly, is still in its teething stage.

Tech Industry by Stephen Shankland February 2, 2017 11:43 AM PST @stshank Up Next Uber CEO Travis Kalanick quits Trump advisory council Enlarge Image A Panasonic 4K TV from 2015 was the high-water mark for Mozilla's effort to bring Firefox to networked devices. Stephen Shankland/CNET So much for Mozilla's quest to bring Firefox to new and different places. The nonprofit organization told employees Thursday that it is eliminating the team tasked with bringing Firefox to connected devices, according to people familiar with the situation. The cuts affect about 50 people. Ari Jaaksi, the senior vice president in charge of the effort, is leaving, and last week, Bertrand Neveux, director of the group's software, told coworkers he's departing, too. Mozilla had about 1,000 employees at the end of 2016. Mozilla confirmed the cuts to the gadget group Thursday. "We have shifted our internal approach to the internet-of-things opportunity," Mozilla said in a statement, "to step back from a focus on launching and scaling commercial products to one focused on research and advanced development, dissolving our connected devices initiative and incorporating our internet-of-things explorations into an increased focus on emerging technologies." The layoffs greatly curtail the nonprofit organization's ability to make Firefox relevant again. Once a dominant choice for internet browsing, it has long been overshadowed by Google's Chrome. Mozilla tried to take the web technology powering Firefox to other devices, but struggled to get acceptance. Its shrinking influence comes at a time when more people are browsing the internet on their phones -- an area where Firefox is particularly weak. Enlarge Image Ari Jaaksi, head of Mozilla's connected devices effort Mozilla Jaaksi and Neveux didn't immediately respond to requests for comment. Unlike what motivates most tech companies, Mozilla's agenda isn't to make money but instead to push for an improvement in the web experience. Even if you don't use Mozilla's software, anyone who's used the web has benefited from Mozilla's role developing new technologies and keeping the browser business competitive. Mozilla's great triumph was pushing back against Microsoft's dominant but stagnant Internet Explorer browser a decade ago, but it has struggled over the last few years. Firefox is virtually absent from phones and tablets, which account for more and more web activity worldwide. Firefox's share of usage in January dropped to 14.9 percent on personal computers and 6.8 percent on all devices, according to web analytics firm StatCounter. Software from Mozilla's connected device team, which was based on the same core technology as Firefox, never caught on widely. Its biggest success was inclusion in Panasonic's 4K TV, but in September, Jaaksi said on a mailing list that Mozilla concluded "Firefox OS TV was a project to be run by our commercial partner and not a project to be led by Mozilla." The connected devices work already was a remnant of a more ambitious project, Firefox OS, which Mozilla hoped would offer an alternative to Google's Android and Apple's iOS to power phones. Firefox OS showed some early promise, attracting a number of business partners, but one year ago, Mozilla killed the Firefox OS phone project and pared back to just connected devices. Other connected devices projects included projects to track personal schedules, check air quality, monitor your home while you're away and promote security and privacy for networked gadgets. Some internet-of-things work will continue in the emerging devices team, but it's directed at projects that could become useful in the longer term, not specific devices and designs. For example, Project Vaani aims to build voice interface technology similar to Amazon Alexa, but ultimately -- through the related Project Pipsqueak -- without sending data to internet servers, in keeping with Mozilla's efforts to improve privacy. Another project, Voicebank, aims to amass the huge quantity of speech samples necessary to train the artificial intelligence systems that perform voice recognition. A team working on Mozilla's DeepSpeech AI effort has been moved to the emerging technologies group, sources said. Although Mozilla has struggled with new technology initiatives, it hasn't become impoverished. Its most recent tax forms showed revenue of $421 million last year largely through partnerships with Yahoo in the US, Yandex in Russia and Baidu in China. Some affected employees are getting new roles in Mozilla, but those losing jobs get severance and job-hunting benefits, Mozilla said. Although about 50 people are affected by the cut, some might stay at Mozilla since they can apply for new positions, some of which Mozilla opened early to ease the pain of the layoffs. And overall, Mozilla is hiring. "People are the reason why we can get anything done -- this isn't lost on us -- and we did not make this decision lightly," Mozilla said.

TECHNOLOGY Tech Ready to Oppose Trump on Reported Anti-LGBT Executive Order 'If Trump wants to start a war with Silicon Valley, this is an excellent way to do it.' By Salvador Rodriguez Salvador Rodriguez is a staff reporter for the San Francisco bureau of Inc. He covers Apple, Google, Facebook, Twitter, tech diversity, virtual reality, and other aspects of technology and entrepreneurship. Previously, Rodriguez was the Silicon Valley correspondent for the International Business Times; before that, he was the lead tech blogger and gadget reviewer for the Los Angeles Times. Rodriguez has interned with The New York Times in Arizona, The Arizona Republic, and the Houston Chronicle. He was born in Mexico and raised in Texas, and he earned his journalism degrees at Arizona State University. One of his special skills is the ability to name all the Super Bowl winners chronologically from memory. @sal19 Staff reporter, Inc.@sal19 WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement In the midst of its fight to support refugees and immigrants, the tech industry is already gearing up for another bout following reports that the Trump Administration could be planning to sign an executive order that would curtail the legal rights of LGBT people in the name of religious expression. The rumored expected order would permit for discrimination against LGBT individuals when it comes to employment, social services, business and adoption, according to LGBTQ Nation. Though not much is known about the details of the order, it is expected to be designed in a manner similar to previous "religious freedom" bills that have made their way through a number of state legislatures. When news of the executive order's existence in draft form first broke earlier this week, the White House responded with a statement affirming the president's commitment to protecting LGBT workers, yet subsequent reports have indicated the order is likely to seek to roll back many legal protections. A number of tech companies and organizations have said they are monitoring these developments before weighing in, but already a handful of firms have said they plan to oppose the order. Most notably, an Uber spokeswoman said the company will likely oppose the order as the company has previously done in Tennessee, Indiana, North Carolina and Massachusetts. Joining Uber is Flipboard, the social magazine startup which issued a statement supporting people who identify as LGBT. "Every person deserves protection from discrimination, including members of the LGBTQ community," said Flipboard CEO Mike McCue. "This is a matter of human rights. As an organization we will not support anything to the contrary." Another company that has spoken out early is Techstars, the popular startup accelerator. "Techstars helps entrepreneurs succeed and we accept entrepreneurs of all backgrounds, races, religions and sexual orientation," said Jenny Lawton, Techstars COO, in a statement. "Techstars is an all-inclusive organization where all are safe from discrimination. We do not support any action that compromises any one person's basic human rights." One industry insider said an executive order of this type would be treated as a "nuclear" attack. "Every worker in the tech industry has LGBTQ friends, family or co-workers. Our employee delegations to the pride parades number in the thousands," the person said. "If Trump wants to start a war with Silicon Valley, this is an excellent way to do it." Already, the tech industry has stood up to Trump in opposition of his anti-immigration executive orders. Several leaders around the industry have spoken out while many of them have also donated tens of thousands of dollars to the American Civil Liberties Union to oppose the actions. At Google, the company's workforce walked out of its offices on Monday in solidarity with their colleagues who have been affected by the order. Should Trump go through with an order allowing for discriminatory treatment of LGBT people, the tech industry will likely enter that fight as well, several leaders of the tech diversity movement said. "The tech industry is no longer willing to sit around, be quiet and let things happen," said Arlan Hamilton, a venture capitalist with Backstage Capital. "LGBTQ tech workers face discrimination every day, especially those who also identify as people of color," said Lesbians Who Tech, an organization that represents 20,000 LGBT women. "President Trump is making a mistake by rolling back commonsense and widely supported protections for LGBTQ contractors and federal employees." Isaac Schlueter, the CEO of npm, an Oakland startup that makes a popular developer tool, said his company will strongly oppose this order should it be issued. Schlueter, who identifies as queer, said he plans to continue contributing to organizations like the ACLU to fight against these types of order. Additionally, Schlueter said npm will refuse to do business with any companies that exercise the order as a means to discriminate against LGBT people. Schlueter said he expects many of his fellow entrepreneurs and innovators to oppose the order as well, citing the industry's history of being progressive on social issues. "So much of what has made California, the United States and Silicon Valley a leader in tech in the world has been our global reach and our inclusivity," Schlueter said. "I suspect that the majority of the tech community will be pretty firmly against a lot of the things that are coming out of this slew of executive orders." Published on: Feb 2, 2017 Advertisement

Food & Dining 1 0 0 February 2, 2017 Taco Bell’s Naked Chicken Chalupa: Do People Like It? Trisha Faulkner Taco Bell’s new Naked Chicken Chalupa has been trending on Google and social media off and on since it was released nationally during the last week of January. As we all know, however, something does not necessarily have to be good in order to trend. So, this leaves everyone with one question – do people like Taco Bell’s new Naked Chicken Chalupa? Keep reading to find out. Taco Bell’s new Chicken Chalupa [Image by William Thomas Cain/Getty Images As the Washington Post notes, chicken is no longer an ingredient used in certain fast food dishes. It has become more of a medium. Fast food restaurants do not hesitate to mold chicken into all sorts of different shapes such as French fries, a hot dog bun, or a substitute for a hamburger bun. Taco Bell has decided to get on the bandwagon of using chicken as more of a medium than an ingredient. With their new Naked Chicken Chalupa, foodies get to enjoy taco shell made out of chicken. We're baring it all today. The #NakedChickenChalupa is here. pic.twitter.com/fjnnI7OhLl — Taco Bell (@tacobell) January 26, 2017 This odd but intriguing chicken taco includes a folded-over piece of fried chicken which services as the shell. The folded-over fried chicken shell is packed with shredded lettuce, diced tomatoes, cheddar cheese, and an avocado ranch sauce. The Washington Post claims the new Naked Chicken Chalupa “could be worse,” but could also be better. “Low expectations probably artificially inflate the upside of the first bite, which smacks you with crunch, salt, fat and spice, at least momentarily hitting a variety of junk food pleasure points.” The Washington Post also notes that the promotional material leads foodies to believe there will be a decent amount of avocado ranch sauce. However, in reality, there was nothing more than a thin layer of it. Joe Avella of Business Insider has the task of tasting Taco Bell’s Naked Chicken Chalupa on video and sharing what he thought of the new chicken taco. His entire taste testing video can be viewed below. We got our hands on @tacobell's new #NakedChickenChalupa with a fried chicken shell and it's surprisingly tasty pic.twitter.com/VfTVR7V8w9 — Business Insider (@businessinsider) January 27, 2017 When Joe Avella of Business Insider first bit into the new Naked Chicken Chalupa, he claimed it was so good it almost made him curse on camera. He went on to discuss how surprisingly thick the chicken shell was and that it did a good job of not buckling under the weight of the ingredients it was packed with. Initially, Joe was not really sure why the Naked Chicken Chalupa came in a cardboard holder. However, he realized the insides do kind of fall out of the shell because of how stuffed it is. He also noted that the shell gets a little greasy as you consume it. While Taco Bell’s Naked Chicken Chalupa does not come with cheese dipping sauce, he did get some with his. He also tasted this on screen and instantly recommended that everyone consider getting an extra cup of cheese sauce to dip this new chicken taco in. As one could imagine, Taco Bell’s Facebook page is also littered with customers giving all sorts of feedback regarding the new Naked Chicken Chalupa. Some of the customers question why there isn’t any beef on the Chalupa. For the most part, it appeared as if Taco Bell customers were impressed with this new chicken taco. The phrase “winner, winner chicken dinner” was used more than a few times by customers throughout the feedback given on the Facebook page.

By Asha McLean | February 3, 2017 -- 00:35 GMT (16:35 PST) | Topic: Tech Industry Microsoft Australia has released its results for the 2015-16 financial year to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC), reporting AU$55.9 million in post-tax profit, a AU$2.2 million profit increase year-on-year. Latest Australian news Transforming the agriculture industry using IoT and predictive analytics ACCC makes final decision to regulate ADSL during NBN transition ​ATO systems restoration experiences 'unforeseen complexity' ​Microsoft Australia posts AU$55.9m profit for 2016 Vodafone uses NBN to extend its mobile coverage For the year ended June 30, 2016, the local arm of the tech giant pulled in AU$92.2 million in profit, paying 39.4 percent -- or AU$36.4 million -- in tax to the Australian government. Revenue for the 12 months was AU$725.8 million. It was revealed in December that for the 2014-15 financial year, Microsoft -- as well as Samsung, Apple, and Google -- upped the amount of tax they paid in Australia over the year prior. According to the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) 2014-15 Corporate Tax Transparency report, Microsoft coughed up AU$33 million in tax, despite the company's ASIC filing indicating tax paid for the period was AU$31.9 million. Under Australia's multinational anti-avoidance laws, companies operating with an annual global income of more than AU$1 billion in Australia are now required to lodge their general purpose financial statements to the ATO -- as of July 1, 2016 -- if they are not already doing so with ASIC. The implementation of the laws by the Australian government was part of recommendations that were made by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) from its G20-commissioned base erosion and profit-shifting (BEPS) project. Microsoft, Apple, and Google admitted last year they were being audited by the ATO for tax avoidance. Non-trivial amounts of Microsoft's revenue derived in Australia is taxed in Singapore, where the tax rate is much lower -- a practice also employed by Google. "The Australian Taxation Office is currently progressing through the ordinary course of an audit of Microsoft Pty Limited for the period of 1 July 2010 to 30 June 2013," Microsoft said in its latest earnings report. "The ultimate outcome of the tax audit cannot be reliably estimated at this time. As a result, no provision has been recorded." In December, Microsoft Australia named Steven Worrall as its new Australian managing director, following the departure of Pip Marlow, who joined Suncorp Bank in the newly created position of chief executive officer for Strategic Innovation. Prior to joining Microsoft, Worrall led IBM's software business for the Asia-Pacific region, providing a major source of IBM's growth in the region. He worked for IBM for 22 years and held a number of marketing, sales, and general management roles during his career in the services, software, and financing segments of the business. Marlow was with Microsoft for 21 years. Globally, Microsoft reported net income of $16.8 billion for fiscal 2016, on revenue of $85.3 billion. Non-GAAP revenue, which reflects Windows 10 sales deferrals, was $92 billion. The company's results were helped by lower tax rates abroad.

Announced last year, Hands Free let customer check out at stores using a voice-activated app that transmitted the payment via Bluetooth.  This allowed users to make purchases without rifling through a bag for a wallet or pulling out a phone to use the likes of Apple Pay or Samsung Pay, hence the name 'Hands Free.' The best phones of 2017 The app tested exclusively in San Francisco at select businesses, and didn't expand out to a public release. Stores that participated in the pilot won't accept payments from Hands Free following the app's closure next week. All is not lost for fans of the unencumbered payment program, as Google says it's now focusing on "bringing the best of the Hands Free technology to a wider audience," leading us to believe some features might make a comeback - most likely as part of Google's existing Android Pay service.  Hands Free is not the only mobile payment method exiting the market lately, with Coin announcing its closure earlier this week following its acquisition by wearable company Fitbit. 7 things small businesses should know about mobile payments ABOUT THE AUTHOR Parker Wilhelm Parker Wilhelm is a freelance writer for TechRadar.

Close February 2, 2017 Google's self-driving car project--now known as Waymo--has put plenty of miles on the odometer. In fact, since 2009, the company's autonomous fleet has traveled 2.3 million miles without assistance from their human companions. All that work is paying big dividends, according to new data from the California Department of Motor Vehicles. California has become a popular site for companies to test their self-driving technology on public roads. It's a big state with varied terrain, and of course, it's got a huge tech community on-hand to perfect autonomous software. However, companies have to secure permits from the state's DMV before they can test self-driving vehicles on public roads. And to maintain those permits, companies have to submit annual reports about their self-driving cars. The reports detail how many miles autonomous cars traveled in self-driving mode on California's public roads. They also list the number of times that autonomous software disengaged--either of its own accord (because, for example, it didn't know how to interpret and maneuver through a given environment) or at the discretion of the human driver (because, for example, the software didn't recognize a problem, like an obstacle in the road or another vehicle). California's DMV recently posted annual reports from automakers and others who've been testing self-driving cars in the state. Based on the data submitted, it's pretty clear that Waymo is way ahead of the competition. Here's a breakdown for each company that submitted a report. We've highlighted the best (Waymo) and worst (Bosch) of the disengagement rates: December 2015 - November 2016 unless otherwise noted BMW: 638 miles, 1 disengagement (1 per 638 miles) Bosch: 983 miles, 1442 disengagements (1 per 0.68 miles) General Motors: (June 2015-November 2016): 10,015.21 miles, 284 disengagements (1 per 35.26 miles) Delphi: 3,125.3 miles, 178 disengagements (1 per 17.56 miles) Ford: 590 miles, 3 disengagements (1 per 196.67 miles) Google/Waymo: 635,868 miles, 124 disengagements (1 per 5,127.97 miles) Honda: No tests on public roads (n/a) Mercedes-Benz: 673.42 miles, 336 disengagements (1 per 2 miles) Nissan: 4,099 miles, 28 disengagements (1 per 146.39 miles) Tesla: 550 miles, 172 disengagements (1 per 3.2 miles) Volkswagen: No tests on public roads (n/a) What makes Waymo's stats even more impressive is the fact that they improved dramatically from the previous year. In its 2015 report, the company said that it's vehicles had traveled 424,331 miles in self-driving mode with 341 disengagements, or one per 1,244.37 miles. It's current rate is about four times better. Also: is anyone else alarmed that Tesla's disengagement rate is so high? After all, this the company that began installing fully autonomous software on new vehicles last year, with plans to begin activating it within the next six months.  Tags: Autonomous cars California Google Google Autonomous Car self-driving cars Tesla Autopilot Waymo News Tesla News 2017 The Car Connection See the winners » 2017 The Car Connection See The Winner and Nominees » Recommended Galleries 2016 Honda Pilot long-term road test: final fuel economy check-in 2017 Ford F-150 recalled to fix software glitch 2016 Honda Pilot long-term road test: wrap up The 2018 Mercedes-AMG E63 S wagon is the family car you really want   Contribute Send us a tip Comment Contact the editor Follow Us   Ratings and Reviews Rate and review your car for The Car Connection Review your car Related Articles Californians can now legally break into cars to rescue animals Uber shifts self-driving cars from CA to AZ after governor tweets an invite California lives up to its threat, forces Uber's self-driving cars off the road Automakers want to dial down EPA's 2025 goals, but energy advocates & consumers push back The Car Connection Daily Headlines Stay up-to-date with the latest news in the car world delivered daily.

In the spoof video, both spar over “alternative facts,” and Cooper can’t contain himself over Kelly’s characterization. Again, it’s important to note that the Anderson Cooper-Kellyanne Conway video is a parody and is meant for entertainment only. A telltale sign that the video of normally mild-mannered Anderson laughing at Conway is a parody is the NBC News logo in the bottom right corner. Cooper is a CNN host. Watch As Anderson Cooper Falls Apart On the Air and Can't Stop Laughing: https://t.co/zk8f4cs7QU — MARK SIMONE (@MarkSimoneNY) January 30, 2017 Kellyanne’s actual interview was with Chuck Todd on Jan. 22 during a Meet the Press interview, according to PolitiFact. There, she tried to make light of White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer’s flub during his first presser when he agreed with Trump’s claim of his inauguration crowd size. The maker of the video attempts to poke fun at Conway and the Trump Administration’s use of “alternative facts.” Kellyanne used the phrase during an interview in her characterization of Millennials. She describes them as Bernie Sanders supporters who are still bitter after the loss of the election. Conway became the target of social media memes, and it was only a matter of time before a parody made it to YouTube. Anderson and Kellyanne have a history of locking horns during live television interviews. Back in October, Cooper and Conway faced off during a segment over Hillary Clinton’s tracking poll numbers. Cooper accused Trump’s campaign of trying to use propaganda to depress the Democratic poll turnout by suggesting Clinton was doing badly in the polls and had no chance at winning the general election. The basis of Kellyanne’s argument was Clinton, despite having major endorsements, more campaign funds, and the support from a popular sitting president, only had a 46 percent sign of confidence from potential voters. “I think Hillary Clinton’s been depressing Democratic turnout. My goodness. Why is this woman at 46 percent? She’s like the magic 46. She’s 46 in the new NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll. She’s 46 percent in a lot of these swing states.” Anderson, in a smart-alecky manner, retorts by saying Clinton was ahead of Trump. “Is that a question? Well, you’re saying 46 percent is bad, but 37 percent is worse.” More recently, the CNN host and Counselor to President Trump went back and forth over claims the then-President-elect and his campaign team misrepresented a report about a secret dossier from a Russian operative. Stuck in the middle of the battle between Anderson Cooper and Kellyanne Conway was the media site, BuzzFeed. The site reportedly published a memo about Trump and President Barack Obama’s briefing about Russia’s compromise before the document went public. For the ages destruction of Kellyane Conway by Anderson Cooper: https://t.co/Q8eRetf2Zx — (((Dan Hodges))) (@DPJHodges) January 12, 2017 The intelligence community was notified, as well as federal prosecutors. However, sources said the claims were unsubstantiated and not enough credible information was available to allege criminal activity on the part of the Russians, according to the Washington Post. Trump and Conway admonished CNN‘s reporting as a transgression of journalism ethics due to a lack of vetting. However, Cooper, Jim Sciutto, and other colleagues insisted that they did not link to the BF story. Anderson didn’t relent in his attack. “CNN is not BuzzFeed—I just wish you guys would acknowledge and just be straightforward. I get why politically it makes sense for you to link CNN with what BuzzFeed did.” At one point, Anderson Cooper tried to align with Kellyanne Conway by empathizing over the campaign’s anger with BF’s premature publication of the document. Still, Conway maintained her indictment of the media and said the country is at a tipping point over the rules of credible journalism. “The fact is that the media have a 16 percent approval rating for a reason. It’s been earned. And it’s crap like this that really undergirds why Donald Trump won. In fact, you’re doing him a favor again. This was an anti-elitist election. It was rejection of everybody who thinks they know better than people.” Politics aside, what do you think about the Anderson Cooper and Kellyanne Conway video? Were you fooled like scores of other viewers in thinking it was the real deal?

 How Snapchat's first investor found Snapchat when it had less than 100,000 users Alyson Shontell Feb. 2, 2017, 6:59 PM 8,642 facebook linkedin twitter email print Jeremy Liew is a partner at Lightspeed Venture Partners who found hot startups like Snapchat and Whisper before everyone else. Lightspeed Snapchat just filed its paperwork to go public. And its 26-year-old CEO isn't the only one who's about to get paid. Lightspeed Ventures was the first venture capital firm to invest in Snapchat, and it owns a meaningful chunk of the company.  Lightspeed found the startup thanks to one of its partners, Jeremy Liew. And in March 2012, Liew's Facebook profile picture was of himself and US President Barack Obama. He didn't know it at the time, but that picture would help him land a crucial early stage investment. When Liew first found Snapchat, the disappearing photo app had fewer than 100,000 installs. Liew's VC partner had seen it on his teenage daughter's phone. She told her father there were only three apps high school kids were using: Angry Birds, Instagram, and Snapchat. Liew was familiar with the first two. But he had never heard of Snapchat. The comment was enough to pique Liew's curiosity. He made it his mission to find out who was behind the mysterious app. Liew did a Google search and came up dry. No articles had been written about Snapchat. There was no contact information on the startup's website except for a generic email address. Liew messaged it and heard nothing back. Liew looked up the company on LinkedIn and sent a message. Lightspeed's office is located on 2200 Sand Hill Road in Menlo Park, California. Business Insider/Alyson Shontell Again, there was no response.  Determined, Liew did a WhoIs lookup on the domain name, Snapchat.com. It had been registered by Toyopa Group, the former parent company of Snapchat. Spiegel had named it after the street his father lived on, Toyopa Drive. Liew did a Google search for Toyopa Group and found Evan Spiegel's name. He was a student at Stanford, where Liew had also gone to school. Liew was able to message him on Facebook through the Stanford alumni network. When Liew sent the Facebook message, Spiegel finally replied. He wasn't looking to raise a round of financing; Liew was fine with that. Liew invited Spiegel to meet him at his office on the most famous street in the entrepreneurial world, Sand Hill Road in Menlo Park.  A few feet to the left sits Greylock Partners, Sequoia Capital and Institutional Venture Partners. To the right sits Khosla Ventures. During the meeting, Spiegel shared his vision for Snapchat. Facebook, he said, was a place where you could share superficial feelings with the world. It was for sharing times when you were happy, confident, and enjoying life. But what about all the other times when you were sad, feeling crazy or even depressed? Liew's Facebook profile picture from March 2012, which attracted Snapchat's Evan Spiegel. "Thanks, Obama!" Jeremy Liew/Facebook Spiegel felt there should be a place where intimate feelings could be expressed privately via fleeting messages.  After all, true friendships are formed when people share both positive and negative experiences. And negative experiences can't be housed on a public, identifying platform like Facebook. Spiegel's app hadn't been downloaded many times, but engagement metrics were strong. "People were using it like crazy and staying for a really long time," Liew recalls. Eventually, Spiegel let Lightspeed invest in his company. It was the only investor in a $485,000 seed round, which Spiegel raised in May 2012. He was still three classes shy of graduating. On Thursday afternoon, Snapchat filed for a $3 billion IPO. Liew later asked Spiegel why he returned the Facebook request and none of his other messages. "It was because you had President Obama in your profile picture," Spiegel said.  "There's serendipity involved in all this stuff," Liew said.   SEE ALSO: Here's who's going to get rich from the Snapchat IPO More: Snapchat Whisper Investors Lightspeed Venture Partners Jeremy Liew facebook linkedin twitter email print × Recommended For You Powered by Sailthru How Snapchat's first investor found Snapchat when it had less than 100,000 users How Snapchat's first investor found Snapchat when it had less than 100,000 users Snapchat just filed its paperwork to go public....

Fallon/Bloomberg Snap Signed Five-Year, $2 Billion Deal to Use Google’s Cloud by Mark Bergen @mhbergen More stories by Mark Bergen February 2, 2017, 5:18 PM EST Terms were shared in the social company’s IPO filing Snap’s committment marks a win for Google against Amazon Snap Inc. plans to spend $2 billion with Alphabet Inc. over the next five years to use Google’s cloud-computing services, according to Snap’s initial public offering filing. The social media firm also listed its dependency on Google as a key risk investors should consider before buying stock. Snap, owner of the Snapchat mobile app, said it relies on Google’s services for the "vast majority" of its computing, bandwidth and data-storage needs. "Any disruption of or interference with our use of the Google Cloud operation would negatively affect our operations and seriously harm our business," the company wrote in the filing on Thursday. The two companies signed an agreement in January for the five-year deal. Under the terms, Snap is required to spend at least $400 million a year on Google cloud services. A portion of these payments can be delayed, during the first four years of the deal. In return for this commitment, Snap said it will get discounted pricing from Google, without being more specific. The deal is a big win for Google’s cloud division, which under Diane Greene, is trying to catch leaders Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp. Snap was an early customers of Google’s cloud services, and the social media company remains one of its largest spenders, people familiar with the companies have said. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Users who cast YouTube videos from their iOS device to their Chromecast, smart TVs, game consoles, etc. will now be able to control playback from the lockscreen as well as the Control Center. Previously, the only way to control playback on YouTube while casting on iOS was through the app itself. This update should let you do it while being in other apps or even when the phone is locked.

The more conversational virtual assistant offers a more polished experience when talking to it compared to past iterations that weren't called Assistant. Despite that, the Assistant's capabilities are still more limited in certain areas than what Google Now used to provide, but that doesn't mean people don't want it on their non-Pixel Android devices. The LG G6 may be the first such smartphone to get the Google Assistant built-in, but apparently it won't be the last. A new rumor says the Huawei Nexus 6P and LG Nexus 5X will finally receive the Assistant alongside the next "major" Android update that will hit these devices. No other, less vague details have been shared unfortunately. However, the use of the word "major" implies that the Google Assistant won't land on the last Nexuses with the currently-in-beta Android 7.1.2 release, since that's clearly very far from being "major". So it may be that owners of the Nexus 6P and 5X will have to wait until later in the year, when Android O drops.

Image: Samsung By Manish SinghIndia2017-02-03 08:32:21 UTC Domestic companies cashing in on India’s cash crunched market with epayment solutions will soon have competition from a global technology giant — Samsung. SEE ALSO: Google is thinking about bringing digital payment services to India Samsung plans to launch its Samsung Pay mobile payment solution in India in the first half of 2017, according to a person familiar with the matter.  For bringing Samsung Pay in India, the company has partnered with American Express (Amex), said the person, adding that the company may be exploring opportunities with giants such as Visa and MasterCard as well.    American Express has been one of the partners of Samsung for the epayment solutions in several other regions including the USA, South Korea and Australia. Elsewhere, Samsung has also partnered with MasterCard and Visa, the two financial services companies that see billions of transactions worldwide on their networks every year.  Samsung began testing the service in India in December last year. Earlier this week, the South Korean technology company rolled out an update to the Galaxy Note5 smartphone in India which included the Samsung Pay app.  Samsung Pay, which rivals Android Pay and Google Pay, requires NFC-equipped point-of-sale terminals for some of its features. That's a hard sell as it would require Samsung to convince merchants across the country to upgrade their existing point-of-sale machines. Most of the point-of-sale devices in India don't support NFC.  Samsung Pay's reach could be limited in India, as the service only works with its high-end smartphones. The support for various cards for transactions is part of the things Samsung is trying to solve with Pay, however. The mobile payment solution has also been positioned as the central database that can store multiple card from various banks as well as Samsung's reward cards and serve as a fast-getaway for any online transaction with a tap or code.  However, Samsung Pay's reach could be limited in India, as the service only works with high-end premium Samsung smartphones.  Samsung has over 2.5 million Galaxy S6, Galaxy S6 Edge, Galaxy S6 Edge+, Galaxy S7, Galaxy S7 Edge, and Galaxy Note5 (the smartphones that support Pay) customers in India, according to marketing research firm Counterpoint.  "This is a pretty good install base and mature users for Samsung Pay to gain initial traction," Tarun Pathak, senior analyst at Counterpoint told Mashable India. Samsung’s interest in India despite all the trouble is understandable. In the light of demonetisation, wallet apps such as Paytm and MobiKwik have reported astronomical growth in transactions and downloads. Paytm said last year that its service was handling more requests than all the plastic cards combined.  While Apple has remained tight lipped on its plans to bring Apple Pay in India, Tim Cook visited ICICI Bank's headquarters and met CEO Chanda Kochhar during his India visit last year, which sparked speculations of the possible launch of Apple Pay in the country. Google CEO Sundar Pichai said last month that the company could introduce a mobile payment solution in Android for the Indian market. He didn’t share a timeframe.

Buy it if you don’t like to carry a charger with you all the time. By: Rohit Arora Published: Friday, February 3, 2017, 13:47 [IST] Smartphones these days pack enough hardware to give your old desktop and some new ones a run for their money. However with no significant improvements in battery technology, most of the handsets these days, even some flagship ones need to be plugged in frequently, sometimes twice or thrice within a day. Rating: 4.0/5 More Gallery » PROS Long lasting battery | Premium and Sturdy design | Swift computing and multitasking performance | Big battery can charge other phones via OTG CONS Camera performance could have been better | Lacks in audio performance Full Specifications That said, the trend of introducing bigger and powerful battery units have become quite common lately and even the end users don't mind carrying some extra ounces in return of a longer batter backup. And that actually make sense because you can only appreciate sleek and light design of a smartphone for initial months and it is the battery backup that matters in everyday usage in a longer run. We have seen a number of handsets from Lenovo, XIaomi, Gionee and Asus offering bigger battery units and he latest to join the heavy duty game is ZTE A2 Plus, which is launched today at a starting of Rs. 11,999 and will be exclusively available on Flipkart. The smartphone is backed by a large 5,000 mAh battery unit that is said to last for two days on a single charge. We tested the smartphone and here's what we have to say about its performance. 5,000 mAh Battery: Yes it lasts long and solves the battery problem It's 8:30 in the morning and my ZTE Blade A2 Plus review unit is 100% charged. The smartphone is configured to handle work and social networks that include two email clients, Facebook, Instagram, two separate accounts on Twitter and Snapchat. Besides, WhatsApp, Facebook messenger and Slack will be active throughout the day that adds to continuous on-screen time. The handset is working on Airtel 4G network in Delhi NCR. I kept the handset on navigation (Google maps) during the 90 minute stretch to my office, just to find out how much battery the GPS drains. The aux cable is also plugged in and music ain't stopping folks. SEE ALSO: ZTE Blade A2 Plus launched in India at Rs. 11,999, sale debuts on February 6 During the 90 minute journey, I received 4 to 5 calls, checked and replied to Facebook and WhatsApp messages and also clicked a couple of shots to test the rear camera performance. I reached my workplace and to my surprise, ZTE Blade A2 Plus still shows 92% battery which is a good start as most of the handsets with conventional battery units tend to lose at least 18 to 20% of juice in similar usage patterns. During the first half which ended at 3 pm in my day's routine, the 5,000 mAh battery unit further discharged by 18%. I had received several calls, streamed two or three YouTube videos on Wi-Fi, and edited a number of pictures in third party editors such as Snapseed and Picsart. I also played Asphalt 8 for about 15 minutes, used Share it to transfer data and as mentioned above, the social networking and work related apps never stopped. I left for home around 6:30pm with 57% juice left in Blade A2 Plus. As I reached home around 8:15 pm following the same usage pattern of GPS and music playback, the ZTE Blade A2 Plus shows 49% battery mark. Before calling it a day, I made 5 to 6 calls, checked e-mails, streamed music for over 30 minutes on a wireless speaker, texted and read some news. At midnight, the battery displays 42% charge and I kept the phone on standby with data turned off and brightness level set to auto level. The next morning I woke up to 41% charge left in ZTE Blade A2 Plus that shows the smartphone is still going strong and does not need to be plugged in for at least next 8 to 10 hours. It was around 6pm in the evening that I finally put the Blade A2 Plus on charging with battery showing 3% charge. So in total, the smartphone managed to last for a good 36 hours on a heavy usage, which means it can easily last for two days and even more if you don't play heavy games or stream YouTube videos on loop. This is quite commendable for a smartphone of this price-point considering the fact that many flagship smartphones that does not even last a day. Design: Premium and Sturdy build To accommodate a bigger 5,000 mAh battery unit, ZTE has to make some compromises that increase the overall weight of the smartphone. Just to give you an overview, ZTE Blade A2 Plus weighs 189 grams compared to its rivals- Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 that presents a sleek design, weighs 175 grams and is backed by a 4,100 mAh battery unit. On the other hand, Huawei's Honor 6X which also sells in the same price-point is powered by a smaller 3,340 mAh battery unit and weighs 162 grams. Besides, Lenovo P2 and Gionee Marathon M5 Plus also offer a 5,000 mAh battery unit and weighs 177 grams and 208 grams respectively. While some can argue over weight and the overall thickness of the handsets packing bigger battery units, I personally don't mind carrying some extra ounces if the very handset can last a day longer without asking for a charge. ZTE Blade A2 Plus is one such handset that presents the right combination of design and features to deliver on everyday performance. Coming on to look and feel, the Blade A2 Plus has a subtle design, which seems quite practical in everyday usage. The rear panel has slightly curves edges that make the smartphone fits comfortably in hands. The top and bottom of the rear panel has two metal sub heads with criss-cross pattern that adds to the style. A 13MP camera module is placed at the top centre along with dual LED flashlight. A fingerprint sensor is integrated on a clickable button, right under the flashlight. The metallic frame with brushed finish accommodates the physical buttons; volume rockers and power button on the right and SIM card slot on the left. The top edge has the 3.5 mm headphone jack and the micro USB charging port rests at the bottom with two speaker grilles. The speaker grille on the right side is functional and the left one is fitted to add symmetry to the overall design. The front of the smartphone is dominated by a 5.5-inch display covered under a 2.5D curved glass that seamlessly blends into the metallic frame. There are two touch capacitive buttons at the bottom of the display, positioned on either side of the home button. The top has an 8MP selfie camera along with an ear piece and a light sensor. As far as usability and handling is concerned, ZTE Blade A2 Plus is comfortable to hold and can even be used with one hand. The buttons and the fingerprint sensor are placed ergonomically so that your thumb and fingers don't struggle to get the job done. The overall weight is very well balanced and the handset does not feel hefty in everyday usage. Overall, ZTE Blade A2 Plus brings a sturdy and practical design. The smartphone cannot be accounted as a sleek looking handset but the payback for a bigger battery is simply appreciable. Display: 5.5-inch full HD Screen is crisp but viewing angles are a bit off ZTE Blade A2 Plus flaunts a 5.5-inch full HD display with a resolution of 1080x1920 pixels. The display delivers good contrast levels and colours have a natural tone to them. ZTE Blade A2 Plus will also please consumers who love to read books/news, play 3D games and watch movies on their handsets. The 5.5-inch full HD screen delivers a pixel density of 401ppi that result in crisp and sharp content. While the content looks crisp and colours have natural tone, the viewing angles are bit unimpressive and we noticed colour shifts upon tilting the screen to different angles. This makes it a bit difficult to use the handset in direct sunlight. Performance: Swift computing and multitasking performance ZTE Blade A2 Plus is powered by an octa-core MediaTek MT6750T processor paired with 4GB of RAM. This MediaTek chipset uses 4 Cortex-A53 cores clocked at 1.5 GHz and the other 4 Cortex-A53 cores clocked at 1GHz. Built on 'Reduced Instruction Set Computing' (RISC) design strategy that enables faster instructions executions, the CPU easily manages everyday tasks and can even handle intensive applications with no major performance issues. The 4GB RAM is more than enough to offer lag free multitasking experience. You can write emails, play music, stream YouTube videos, post pictures on Instagram and chat on WhatsApp without worrying about any performance slowdown. Software: ZTE's custom software skin based on Android 6.0 Marshmallow Like most of the Chinese Android handsets, ZTE Blade A2 Plus has a custom skin that misses an app drawer and have all the icons placed on home screens. It is based on Android 6.0 marshmallow and is mostly stock Android. We did not notice any app crashes or lags while using the handset. The screen navigation is smooth and you also get a slew of customization options to tweak the look and feel of the handset. The smartphone also has gesture and motion support. You can double tap to wake up the screen, flip the handset to mute the audio, enable auto call that dials the on-screen number when you put the phone close to your ear, etc. All these features can be accessed 'Gesture and Motion' section in settings menu. Besides, you can customize the placement of touch capacitive buttons at the bottom of the display and can even set shortcuts to be accessible via fingerprint sensor placed at the rear side. As we mentioned in the design part of the review, the fingerprint sensor is fitted on a clickable button that can be set to capture a screenshot upon a single click, launch the camera app with double click and switches on the flashlight when you long press the fingerprint sensor. Overall, the smartphone delivers on software front with a lag free user interface that also comes loaded with nifty features. Camera: Decent Camera performance and you also get RAW image format support ZTE Blade A2 Plus features a 13MP rear camera that has CMOS sensor inside and comes with phase detection auto focus (PDAF). The camera is accompanied by a dual tone LED flashlight and can even capture images in RAW format. This will please photo enthusiasts who love to tweak the images they capture from their mobile devices. The 13MP rear camera captures good quality images in daylight conditions. The color tones look natural and the camera software do not add any artificial saturation to the images. Besides, the images captured have good level of detailing. Here are some images captured in daylight. While the camera performance is good when the light is sufficient, it is the low-light performance where the 13MP CMOS sensor fails to impress. It struggles to focus on the subject and leads to blurry shots if your hand is not still. The camera app has a total of 9 filters that allows you to enhance the mobile photography experience. The camera also has Electronic Image Stabilization to support video recording that goes maximum to 1080p resolution in 30fps. The 8MP front camera is quite a good performer when it comes to click selfies. The images have good detailing and you can even capture selfies in HDR mode. The selfie camera app also has gesture mode to click selfies. Connectivity, Audio and call quality As far as connectivity is concerned, ZTE Blade A2 Plus offers all the required options. The smartphone has Wi-Fi, GPS, Bluetooth and OTG reverse charging that allows you to charge other mobile devices with the help of large 5,000 mAh battery unit. Besides, the radio-frequency module fitted in the handset also supports 4G LTE and VoLTE connectivity. You can use two nano SIM cards at a time or one SIM card and a microSD card that can expand the storage by up to 128GB. We used the handset with Airtel 4G in Delhi NCR and did not face any call quality issues. The audio performance delivered by the right speaker grille is not up to the mark and you have to use earphones to enjoy music while you tune in to your favorite tracks or watch movies. Verdict At an aggressive price of Rs. 11,999, ZTE Blade A2 Plus is a good budget Android handset for users who are looking for a smartphone that can easily last for two days and offer a good overall performance. The smartphone has a premium and sturdy build quality, crisp 1080p screen, lag free user interface and enough RAM to tackle intensive multitasking without breaking a sweat. The only weak point seems to be its camera performance where it lacks behind from the competition.

Buy it if you don’t like to carry a charger with you all the time. By: Rohit Arora Published: Friday, February 3, 2017, 13:47 [IST] Smartphones these days pack enough hardware to give your old desktop and some new ones a run for their money. However with no significant improvements in battery technology, most of the handsets these days, even some flagship ones need to be plugged in frequently, sometimes twice or thrice within a day. Rating: 4.0/5 More Gallery » PROS Long lasting battery | Premium and Sturdy design | Swift computing and multitasking performance | Big battery can charge other phones via OTG CONS Camera performance could have been better | Lacks in audio performance Full Specifications That said, the trend of introducing bigger and powerful battery units have become quite common lately and even the end users don't mind carrying some extra ounces in return of a longer batter backup. And that actually make sense because you can only appreciate sleek and light design of a smartphone for initial months and it is the battery backup that matters in everyday usage in a longer run. We have seen a number of handsets from Lenovo, XIaomi, Gionee and Asus offering bigger battery units and he latest to join the heavy duty game is ZTE A2 Plus, which is launched today at a starting of Rs. 11,999 and will be exclusively available on Flipkart. The smartphone is backed by a large 5,000 mAh battery unit that is said to last for two days on a single charge. We tested the smartphone and here's what we have to say about its performance. 5,000 mAh Battery: Yes it lasts long and solves the battery problem It's 8:30 in the morning and my ZTE Blade A2 Plus review unit is 100% charged. The smartphone is configured to handle work and social networks that include two email clients, Facebook, Instagram, two separate accounts on Twitter and Snapchat. Besides, WhatsApp, Facebook messenger and Slack will be active throughout the day that adds to continuous on-screen time. The handset is working on Airtel 4G network in Delhi NCR. I kept the handset on navigation (Google maps) during the 90 minute stretch to my office, just to find out how much battery the GPS drains. The aux cable is also plugged in and music ain't stopping folks. SEE ALSO: ZTE Blade A2 Plus launched in India at Rs. 11,999, sale debuts on February 6 During the 90 minute journey, I received 4 to 5 calls, checked and replied to Facebook and WhatsApp messages and also clicked a couple of shots to test the rear camera performance. I reached my workplace and to my surprise, ZTE Blade A2 Plus still shows 92% battery which is a good start as most of the handsets with conventional battery units tend to lose at least 18 to 20% of juice in similar usage patterns. During the first half which ended at 3 pm in my day's routine, the 5,000 mAh battery unit further discharged by 18%. I had received several calls, streamed two or three YouTube videos on Wi-Fi, and edited a number of pictures in third party editors such as Snapseed and Picsart. I also played Asphalt 8 for about 15 minutes, used Share it to transfer data and as mentioned above, the social networking and work related apps never stopped. I left for home around 6:30pm with 57% juice left in Blade A2 Plus. As I reached home around 8:15 pm following the same usage pattern of GPS and music playback, the ZTE Blade A2 Plus shows 49% battery mark. Before calling it a day, I made 5 to 6 calls, checked e-mails, streamed music for over 30 minutes on a wireless speaker, texted and read some news. At midnight, the battery displays 42% charge and I kept the phone on standby with data turned off and brightness level set to auto level. The next morning I woke up to 41% charge left in ZTE Blade A2 Plus that shows the smartphone is still going strong and does not need to be plugged in for at least next 8 to 10 hours. It was around 6pm in the evening that I finally put the Blade A2 Plus on charging with battery showing 3% charge. So in total, the smartphone managed to last for a good 36 hours on a heavy usage, which means it can easily last for two days and even more if you don't play heavy games or stream YouTube videos on loop. This is quite commendable for a smartphone of this price-point considering the fact that many flagship smartphones that does not even last a day. Design: Premium and Sturdy build To accommodate a bigger 5,000 mAh battery unit, ZTE has to make some compromises that increase the overall weight of the smartphone. Just to give you an overview, ZTE Blade A2 Plus weighs 189 grams compared to its rivals- Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 that presents a sleek design, weighs 175 grams and is backed by a 4,100 mAh battery unit. On the other hand, Huawei's Honor 6X which also sells in the same price-point is powered by a smaller 3,340 mAh battery unit and weighs 162 grams. Besides, Lenovo P2 and Gionee Marathon M5 Plus also offer a 5,000 mAh battery unit and weighs 177 grams and 208 grams respectively. While some can argue over weight and the overall thickness of the handsets packing bigger battery units, I personally don't mind carrying some extra ounces if the very handset can last a day longer without asking for a charge. ZTE Blade A2 Plus is one such handset that presents the right combination of design and features to deliver on everyday performance. Coming on to look and feel, the Blade A2 Plus has a subtle design, which seems quite practical in everyday usage. The rear panel has slightly curves edges that make the smartphone fits comfortably in hands. The top and bottom of the rear panel has two metal sub heads with criss-cross pattern that adds to the style. A 13MP camera module is placed at the top centre along with dual LED flashlight. A fingerprint sensor is integrated on a clickable button, right under the flashlight. The metallic frame with brushed finish accommodates the physical buttons; volume rockers and power button on the right and SIM card slot on the left. The top edge has the 3.5 mm headphone jack and the micro USB charging port rests at the bottom with two speaker grilles. The speaker grille on the right side is functional and the left one is fitted to add symmetry to the overall design. The front of the smartphone is dominated by a 5.5-inch display covered under a 2.5D curved glass that seamlessly blends into the metallic frame. There are two touch capacitive buttons at the bottom of the display, positioned on either side of the home button. The top has an 8MP selfie camera along with an ear piece and a light sensor. As far as usability and handling is concerned, ZTE Blade A2 Plus is comfortable to hold and can even be used with one hand. The buttons and the fingerprint sensor are placed ergonomically so that your thumb and fingers don't struggle to get the job done. The overall weight is very well balanced and the handset does not feel hefty in everyday usage. Overall, ZTE Blade A2 Plus brings a sturdy and practical design. The smartphone cannot be accounted as a sleek looking handset but the payback for a bigger battery is simply appreciable. Display: 5.5-inch full HD Screen is crisp but viewing angles are a bit off ZTE Blade A2 Plus flaunts a 5.5-inch full HD display with a resolution of 1080x1920 pixels. The display delivers good contrast levels and colours have a natural tone to them. ZTE Blade A2 Plus will also please consumers who love to read books/news, play 3D games and watch movies on their handsets. The 5.5-inch full HD screen delivers a pixel density of 401ppi that result in crisp and sharp content. While the content looks crisp and colours have natural tone, the viewing angles are bit unimpressive and we noticed colour shifts upon tilting the screen to different angles. This makes it a bit difficult to use the handset in direct sunlight. Performance: Swift computing and multitasking performance ZTE Blade A2 Plus is powered by an octa-core MediaTek MT6750T processor paired with 4GB of RAM. This MediaTek chipset uses 4 Cortex-A53 cores clocked at 1.5 GHz and the other 4 Cortex-A53 cores clocked at 1GHz. Built on 'Reduced Instruction Set Computing' (RISC) design strategy that enables faster instructions executions, the CPU easily manages everyday tasks and can even handle intensive applications with no major performance issues. The 4GB RAM is more than enough to offer lag free multitasking experience. You can write emails, play music, stream YouTube videos, post pictures on Instagram and chat on WhatsApp without worrying about any performance slowdown. Software: ZTE's custom software skin based on Android 6.0 Marshmallow Like most of the Chinese Android handsets, ZTE Blade A2 Plus has a custom skin that misses an app drawer and have all the icons placed on home screens. It is based on Android 6.0 marshmallow and is mostly stock Android. We did not notice any app crashes or lags while using the handset. The screen navigation is smooth and you also get a slew of customization options to tweak the look and feel of the handset. The smartphone also has gesture and motion support. You can double tap to wake up the screen, flip the handset to mute the audio, enable auto call that dials the on-screen number when you put the phone close to your ear, etc. All these features can be accessed 'Gesture and Motion' section in settings menu. Besides, you can customize the placement of touch capacitive buttons at the bottom of the display and can even set shortcuts to be accessible via fingerprint sensor placed at the rear side. As we mentioned in the design part of the review, the fingerprint sensor is fitted on a clickable button that can be set to capture a screenshot upon a single click, launch the camera app with double click and switches on the flashlight when you long press the fingerprint sensor. Overall, the smartphone delivers on software front with a lag free user interface that also comes loaded with nifty features. Camera: Decent Camera performance and you also get RAW image format support ZTE Blade A2 Plus features a 13MP rear camera that has CMOS sensor inside and comes with phase detection auto focus (PDAF). The camera is accompanied by a dual tone LED flashlight and can even capture images in RAW format. This will please photo enthusiasts who love to tweak the images they capture from their mobile devices. The 13MP rear camera captures good quality images in daylight conditions. The color tones look natural and the camera software do not add any artificial saturation to the images. Besides, the images captured have good level of detailing. Here are some images captured in daylight. While the camera performance is good when the light is sufficient, it is the low-light performance where the 13MP CMOS sensor fails to impress. It struggles to focus on the subject and leads to blurry shots if your hand is not still. The camera app has a total of 9 filters that allows you to enhance the mobile photography experience. The camera also has Electronic Image Stabilization to support video recording that goes maximum to 1080p resolution in 30fps. The 8MP front camera is quite a good performer when it comes to click selfies. The images have good detailing and you can even capture selfies in HDR mode. The selfie camera app also has gesture mode to click selfies. Connectivity, Audio and call quality As far as connectivity is concerned, ZTE Blade A2 Plus offers all the required options. The smartphone has Wi-Fi, GPS, Bluetooth and OTG reverse charging that allows you to charge other mobile devices with the help of large 5,000 mAh battery unit. Besides, the radio-frequency module fitted in the handset also supports 4G LTE and VoLTE connectivity. You can use two nano SIM cards at a time or one SIM card and a microSD card that can expand the storage by up to 128GB. We used the handset with Airtel 4G in Delhi NCR and did not face any call quality issues. The audio performance delivered by the right speaker grille is not up to the mark and you have to use earphones to enjoy music while you tune in to your favorite tracks or watch movies. Verdict At an aggressive price of Rs. 11,999, ZTE Blade A2 Plus is a good budget Android handset for users who are looking for a smartphone that can easily last for two days and offer a good overall performance. The smartphone has a premium and sturdy build quality, crisp 1080p screen, lag free user interface and enough RAM to tackle intensive multitasking without breaking a sweat. The only weak point seems to be its camera performance where it lacks behind from the competition.

Updated: Friday, February 3, 2017, 13:59 [IST] Subscribe to Oneindia News San Francisco, Feb 3: Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and about 1,000 of his colleagues have donated over USD 1.5 million to a leading rights group that has pledged to fight President Donald Trump's temporary ban on refugees and immigrants from seven Muslim-majority countries. The donation has been made to American Civil Liberties Union that has reportedly raised more than USD 24 million in online donations in the past few days. Initially, 925 Twitter staff pulled together a donation of over USD 530,000. That was then matched by CEO Dorsey and Executive Chairman Omid Kordestani to take the total to USD 1.59 million, TechCrunch reported, citing a company-wide email. The logo of Twitter A Twitter spokesperson confirmed the donation and the numbers involved to the tech industry news website. "Our work is far from done. In the coming months we'll see a flurry of legal challenges, legislative pushes and public pronouncements. But as long as civil liberties are threatened, I'm proud to know that as individuals we will stand up to defend freedom and look after people," Twitter General Counsel Vijaya Gadde wrote in the memo. "The Executive Order's humanitarian and economic impact is real and upsetting," Dorsey said on Twitter over the weekend. "We benefit from what refugees and immigrants bring to the US," he said. Also, Microsoft has requested the Trump administration to ease travel restrictions on its employees affected by the executive order on immigration, visa and border security. Trump last week signed the sweeping executive order to suspend the arrival of refugees and impose tough new controls on travellers from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen as part of new measures to "keep radical Islamic terrorists" out of America. Silicon Valley's top executives, including India-born CEOs Google's Sundar Pichai and Microsoft's Satya Nadella, had condemned Trump's immigration ban, voicing concern that the move could directly hit their own staffers and stop bringing great talent to the US. Executives from Microsoft, Google, Apple, Netflix, Tesla, Facebook, Uber and other top American companies slammed Trump's immigration order that sparked widespread protests across the US. Tech giant Google also created a crisis fund that could raise up to USD 4 million for four immigrant rights organisations, including ACLU and UN High Commissioner for Refugees. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg was one of the first to address the ban publicly. "We need to keep this country safe, but we should do that by focusing on people who actually pose a threat. Expanding the focus of law enforcement beyond people who are real threats would make all Americans less safe by diverting resources...," he had written on Facebook.

Whether it is web publishing, online commerce and banking, driverless cars, or computer games, there is an insatiable demand for people with computing skills to help design and build our modern economy. Eric Schmidt, chairman of the parent company of Google,declared in 2011 on a visit to Scotland that he had been “flabbergasted to learn that computer science was not taught as standard” in our schools. And it is easy to see why when you realise the skill shortages that we are facing – around 84,000 people currently work in Scotland in the development of digital technologies and we need at least 11,000 more each year. However as Scotland’s universities collectively graduate just over 3,000 computing students a year – many of whom hail from overseas – it is clear there is a massive skills gap emerging. And, disappointingly, over the decade from 2004 to 2014 the number of students studying computer science at UK universities actually dropped by 28.7 per cent. You're never too young to learn computer skills (Photo: Getty) Clearly for the sake of our economy something must be done to tackle this critical skills shortage, and it has to start in the schools. However despite Schmidt’s well-publicised 2011 warnings, computer science teaching in Scottish schools has continued to collapse. The number of computer science teachers in Scotland has fallen from 866 in 2007 to 663 in 2014 – a drop of 14 per cent. In fact one school in eight has no teacher for computer science and cannot present students for certificate level courses. Six of Glasgow’s high schools (20 per cent) and almost half of the schools (47 per cent) in Dumfries and Galloway are now without a computing teacher. Read More Comment: Short-termism fuels spike in member voluntary liquidations Head teachers have often given up in the face of low student demand and the difficulty of hiring qualified teaching staff. One said “when the teacher left…despite several attempts at advertising the post there were no applicants”. So what is to be done? I recently met a woman who had returned to teaching after a 17-year career with Oracle, one of the world’s largest software companies. Her first degree – in Geography – did not allow her to teach computing in Scotland and, to her credit, she undertook an Open University degree to obtain the required qualification. But few would be willing to go to these lengths, especially if, as was the case here, she was very well-qualified from her industrial experience, unlike, for example, me whose yellowing computer science degree from 1974 allows me to teach computing, even though I haven’t written a program for 35 years and would be pretty hopeless at teaching it. Read More Comment: Avoiding the contractual own goal A new initiative in London called Now Teach aims to allow professionally qualified and experienced individuals who want such a career change to teach while receiving on the job training leading to a fully qualified NQT certificate. And last St Andrew’s Day, Scottish education secretary John Swinney announced a new Scottish ‘fast track’ training scheme to incentivise science and technology professionals to retrain as teachers. It falls far short of the flexibility of the London scheme, and it doesn’t begin to address the importance of current relevant experience compared to having the ‘wrong’ historic university qualification. Scotland’s teacher’s unions continue to strongly resist such reforms. I estimate that there are a great many computing professionals who would consider such a switch of career – if there was a sensible recognition of current professional experience every school could soon get superbly qualified and up-to-date computing teachers.

The donation has been made to American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) that has reportedly raised more than USD 24 million in online donations in the past few days. Initially, 925 Twitter staff pulled together a donation of over USD 530,000. That was then matched by CEO Dorsey and Executive Chairman Omid Kordestani to take the total to USD 1.59 million, TechCrunch reported, citing a company-wide email. A Twitter spokesperson confirmed the donation and the numbers involved to the tech industry news website. "Our work is far from done. In the coming months we'll see a flurry of legal challenges, legislative pushes and public pronouncements. But as long as civil liberties are threatened, I'm proud to know that as individuals we will stand up to defend freedom and look after people," Twitter General Counsel Vijaya Gadde wrote in the memo. "The Executive Order's humanitarian and economic impact is real and upsetting," Dorsey said on Twitter over the weekend. "We benefit from what refugees and immigrants bring to the US," he said. Also, Microsoft has requested the Trump administration to ease travel restrictions on its employees affected by the executive order on immigration, visa and border security. Trump last week signed the sweeping executive order to suspend the arrival of refugees and impose tough new controls on travellers from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen as part of new measures to "keep radical Islamic terrorists" out of America. Silicon Valley's top executives, including India-born CEOs Google's Sundar Pichai and Microsoft's Satya Nadella, had condemned Trump's immigration ban, voicing concern that the move could directly hit their own staffers and stop bringing great talent to the US. Executives from Microsoft, Google, Apple, Netflix, Tesla, Facebook, Uber and other top American companies slammed Trump's immigration order that sparked widespread protests across the US. Tech giant Google also created a crisis fund that could raise up to USD 4 million for four immigrant rights organisations, including ACLU and UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg was one of the first to address the ban publicly. "We need to keep this country safe, but we should do that by focusing on people who actually pose a threat. Expanding the focus of law enforcement beyond people who are real threats would make all Americans less safe by diverting resources...," he had written on Facebook.

IE Home Nation World Opinion Sports Entertainment Lifestyle Technology Viral Photos Videos E-Paper Apps RSS Gadgets Review Photos Videos Mobile & Tabs Science Indian Express Home Home Technology Tech News Trump immigration ban: Microsoft’s exemption plan, Facebook to be hit by H1-B Trump immigration ban: Microsoft’s exemption plan, Facebook to be hit by H1-B Microsoft President Brad Smith outlined a program for case-by-case review of exceptions to the travel ban By: Tech Desk | Published:February 3, 2017 1:35 pm Microsoft has proposed a program to Trump’s administration which will allow people from these ‘banned’ nations to enter and leave the United States on business or family emergency travel if they hold valid work or student visas. (Source: Reuters) Silicon Valley majors like Apple, Microsoft, Google, Facebook, Twitter Uber are resisting President Trump’s executive order on immigration, which has banned the entry of nationals from seven Muslim-majority countries, including those people who have valid visas. There are also reports that the Trump administration wants to toughen the rules for H1-B visas, which is commonly used by Silicon Valley players to get new talent into the country. While a report in Wall Street Journal said Apple is contemplating taking the Trump administration to court for its executive order, another said most of the major technology companies have come up with a draft letter to the President asking him to repeal the order. Now Microsoft has proposed a program to Trump’s administration which will allow people from these ‘banned’ nations to enter and leave the United States on business or family emergency travel if they hold valid work or student visas, and have not committed any crimes. Watch all our videos from Express Technology In a letter to Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Microsoft President Brad Smith outlined a program for case-by-case review of exceptions to a travel ban instituted last week. In Microsoft’s case 76 employees, and 41 dependents were affected by the travel ban. Also read: Microsoft, Amazon and Expedia to support lawsuit against Trump immigration order Meanwhile Amazon and Expedia Inc have filed declarations supporting a legal challenge to the order by the Washington state Attorney General. Microsoft’s proposal would cover holders of the H-1B visa, a temporary work visa that the tech sector relies on to recruit foreign talent. The order has allowed green card holders, but H-1B holders from these affected countries remain banned. According to the Reuters report, “the proposal would also allow students to travel from affected countries if they can prove they were enrolled and in good standing at a US school.” “In short, these individuals are ‘known quantities’ in their communities: their character, personalities, conduct, and behavior is understood by their colleagues, employers, friends, and neighbors,” Microsoft’s Smith said in a blog post. The blog post goes on to say, “Business travel abroad would not include passage through the countries covered by the executive order. Personal travel abroad for exigent family-related emergencies may allow for travel to any country on a case-by-case basis.” Read more: Google employees protest President Trump’s order: What Sergey Brin, Sundar Pichai said It adds that many of the individuals “fill critical roles in the organizations that employ them, whether they are doctors, scientists, engineers, medical technicians, software developers, or any number of other highly skilled professionals,” and “valued contributors to the innovation, research and business acumen of our nation”. Meanwhile, there are reports that the Trump administration and Congress plan to make the H-1B program more restrictive. One company that could be severely impacted by changes to the H1-B visa program is Facebook. A Reuters analysis of US Labour Department filings shows that 15 per cent of Facebook’s US employees in 2016 used a temporary work visa, giving the social media leader a legal classification as a H-1B “dependent” company.

The donation has been made to American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) that has reportedly raised more than USD 24 million in online donations in the past few days. Initially, 925 Twitter staff pulled together a donation of over USD 530,000. That was then matched by CEO Dorsey and Executive Chairman Omid Kordestani to take the total to USD 1.59 million, TechCrunch reported, citing a company-wide email. A Twitter spokesperson confirmed the donation and the numbers involved to the tech industry news website. "Our work is far from done. In the coming months we'll see a flurry of legal challenges, legislative pushes and public pronouncements. But as long as civil liberties are threatened, I'm proud to know that as individuals we will stand up to defend freedom and look after people," Twitter General Counsel Vijaya Gadde wrote in the memo. "The Executive Order's humanitarian and economic impact is real and upsetting," Dorsey said on Twitter over the weekend. "We benefit from what refugees and immigrants bring to the US," he said. Also, Microsoft has requested the Trump administration to ease travel restrictions on its employees affected by the executive order on immigration, visa and border security. Trump last week signed the sweeping executive order to suspend the arrival of refugees and impose tough new controls on travellers from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen as part of new measures to "keep radical Islamic terrorists" out of America. Silicon Valley's top executives, including India-born CEOs Google's Sundar Pichai and Microsoft's Satya Nadella, had condemned Trump's immigration ban, voicing concern that the move could directly hit their own staffers and stop bringing great talent to the US. Executives from Microsoft, Google, Apple, Netflix, Tesla, Facebook, Uber and other top American companies slammed Trump's immigration order that sparked widespread protests across the US. Tech giant Google also created a crisis fund that could raise up to USD 4 million for four immigrant rights organisations, including ACLU and UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg was one of the first to address the ban publicly. "We need to keep this country safe, but we should do that by focusing on people who actually pose a threat. Expanding the focus of law enforcement beyond people who are real threats would make all Americans less safe by diverting resources...," he had written on Facebook.

Overall, the report suggests eurozone growth is gathering pace, according to Julien Lafargue, European Equities Strategist at JP Morgan. He says: Although Germany has decelerated somewhat in the recent months, today’s PMIs are clearly pointing to accelerating GDP growth in the Eurozone in 2017. In addition, the rate of job creation - the fastest since February 2008 – indicates that this momentum could be sustained in the coming months. Going forward, it will be important to keep an eye on cost pressures which continue to intensify. The companies’ ability to pass these higher costs onto consumers will be critical to support margins and the earnings recovery we anticipate.

Donald Trump’s shock election victory has been “marginally” good for the UK economy, according to one of the Bank of England’s top officials. Deputy governor Ben Broadbent argued that Britain has benefitted from the jump in financial confidence following Trump’s win last November. Speaking to BBC Breakfast TV, Broadbent said: “You’ve seen business confidence rise particularly in the United States. You’ve seen financial markets get more optimistic and I think that has had some impact on us. “So far, at the margin, yes, it’s been positive for global sentiment, and for that reason, and to that extent, for us as well.” Broadbent also cautioned, though, that we don’t know exactly what Trump will do: “And I should say overall that... there’s a lot we have yet to see about the detailed plans, including those for fiscal policy, for government spending and taxes and so forth, so we’ll have to wait and see.” Yesterday the Bank of England hiked its growth forecasts for the UK economy this year, prompting criticism that it was too gloomy after the EU referendum result.

He’s expected to see Blackstone CEO Steve Schwarzman, Blackrock boss Laurence Fink and JP Morgan’s Jamie Dimon, among others That may not dispel concerns that the new administration is batting for the banking sector, rather than the public. For example, Obama’s fiduciary rules are means to protect millions of retired Americans from being missold investments by brokers, to get bumper profits. However, the White House line is that removing regulations is good for investors, which is why they want the rule rescinded. As Bloomberg puts it: The two executive actions are designed to lay out the Trump administration’s approach to financial markets, with an emphasis on removing regulatory burdens and opening up investor options, said the White House official, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity. Photograph: Bloomberg TV Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.03am EST 03:03 Trump to 'Undo Dodd-Frank Law and Obama's Fiduciary Rule' Some breaking news from America.... US president Donald Trump is expected to start unpicking some of the rules created after the 2008 crisis to to rein in the financial sector. US media are reporting that Trump will order a review of the Dodd-Frank rules, which are designed to stop banks being too reckless. He’s also apparently planning to sign another executive action that could halt President Obama’s Fiduciary Rules. This regulation forces retirement advisers to work in the best interests of their clients; Trump will ask the US labor secretary to consider rescinding it, reports say. The Dodd-Frank rules were a major attempt to avoid a repeat of the crisis that brought down Lehman Brothers. They force banks to be more transparent, provide extra consumer protection, and are meant to prevent the kind of risks that led to the meltdown of the sector nine years ago. But they’re also unpopular with banks, who argue that they restrict business. Gary Cohn, the director of the White House National Economic Council, has told the Wall Street Journal that unravelling these safeguards will be good for consumers (as well as the banks, of course!). Cohn (a former president of Goldman Sachs) argued: “Americans are going to have better choices and Americans are going to have better products because we’re not going to burden the banks with literally hundreds of billions of dollars of regulatory costs every year. “The banks are going to be able to price product more efficiently and more effectively to consumers.” More here: Donald Trump Plans to Undo Dodd-Frank Law, Fiduciary Rule Alice Truong (@alicetruong) Trump plans to dismantle much of the regulatory system put in place after the financial crisis https://t.co/UcQYkyBv7W February 3, 2017 Gemma Felicity Acton (@GemmaActon) Busy day ahead with exec orders said to be coming to roll back Dodd-Frank, cancel fiduciary rule, water down gun owner background checks...

Donald Trump once promised to be “the greatest jobs president God ever created”. And today we’ll find out whether his rise to the White House has had any impact on the US labour market yet. The latest US Non-Farm Payroll (NFP), due at 1.30pm GMT (8.30am East Coast), will show how many new jobs were created across America last month, whether wages rose, and whether more people were lured back to the jobs market. Economists expect a fairly solid report. The payroll is expected to rise by around 180,000 jobs leaving the unemployment rate at a healthy-looking 4.7%. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets suggests we could get an even stronger report: This would suggest that the 180k estimate being predicted is probably too low, with a figure in excess of 200k not being beyond the realms of possibility. Such a high number given an unemployment rate of 4.7%, would suggest that there is probably still a fair degree of slack in the jobs market. Wages are also likely to be closely watched with a rise of 0.3% expected, with an annualised rise of 2.8%, down slightly from December’s 2.9%. The report could easily move the markets, as the strength of the US jobs market will determine how quickly the Federal Reserve can raise interest rates this year.

 Google's latest doodle honors Fred Korematsu, the activist who fought against Japanese internment camps Steve Kovach Jan. 30, 2017, 10:54 AM 8,214 facebook linkedin twitter email print Google's Doodle honoring Fred Korematsu.Google Call it Google's first sub-doodle. In the week following President Trump's orders to build a border wall with Mexico and a ban of immigrants from seven predominately Muslim countries, Google's Doodle Monday celebrated Fred Korematsu, the civil rights activist who fought against Japanese internment camps in the US during World War II. Korematsu would've been 98 on Monday. Korematsu filed a civil suit challenging the internment camps that went all the way to the Supreme Court. However, he lost the case. Decades later, the US apologized for the executive order that placed people of Japanese ancestry in internment camps. Eventually, some were compensated. Google and its parent company Alphabet have had mixed dealings with the Trump administration so far. Before Trump's inauguration, Alphabet CEO Larry Page and chairman Eric Schmidt met with then president-elect Trump in the so-called "tech summit" in Trump tower. Schmidt met with Trump again a few weeks later. Google CEO Sundar Pichai sent a memo to staff Friday that criticized Trump's executive order on immigration. “We’re upset about the impact of this order and any proposals that could impose restrictions on Googlers and their families, or that could create barriers to bringing great talent to the US," Pichai wrote.  "It’s painful to see the personal cost of this executive order on our colleagues," he added. Google also sent out a tweet with one of Korematsu's quotes on Monday afternoon: "If you have the feeling that something is wrong, don't be afraid to speak up." - Fred Korematsu #GoogleDoodle https://t.co/sUgieswYuS pic.twitter.com/XxoYHCWQlv — Google (@Google) January 30, 2017   SEE ALSO: Google CEO didn't have an answer for how the company would make money off voice searches NOW WATCH: WPP CEO Sir Martin Sorrell on Snapchat becoming the 'third force' to Google and Facebook Loading video...

It's Friday! Sad coders write bad code – official Boffins urge bosses to keep their developers cheerful 3 Feb 2017 at 07:56, Thomas Claburn Miserable software developers produce miserable software, to the further detriment of organizational productivity and personal health. Researchers from the University of Stuttgart, University of Helsinki, Free University of Bozen-Bolzano, and the Norwegian University of Science and Technology have completed a study [PDF] of unhappy programmers, to enumerate the consequences of their sad state. "Recent literature has suggested that a cost-effective way to foster happiness and productivity among workers could be to limit unhappiness of developers due to its negative impact," the researchers state in their paper. "However, possible negative effects of unhappiness are still largely unknown in the software development context." Ignoring for a moment the bewildering need for "literature" to establish that promoting happiness limits unhappiness, there's some value in assessing the consequences of demoralized, downtrodden, or otherwise depressed developers. Tech companies have been known to spend extravagantly on employee perks, largely to keep difficult-to-replace technical talent from leaving for greener pastures. Google has climbing walls. Facebook has on-site barbers. And in what might equally be called a workplace benefit or a war on families, Apple will pay for female employees who elect to freeze their eggs to delay childbearing. So are such niceties necessary? Twilio CEO Jeff Lawson recently told The Register that companies risk alienating their developers if they fail to treat them as creative professionals. Our intrepid researchers describe the form that alienation might take, linking causes and effects in an effort to help developers and managers create a happier workplace. They surveyed 181 developers with GitHub repositories to plumb the sources of their dark moods and the fallout. Developers, as they report about themselves, have a lot to complain about. They don't like poor quality code, bad codebases, or refactoring. They resent code complexity, code reviews, and difficult problems. They resent technical infrastructure that constrains them and poor documentation. They can't stand vague requirements, unrealistic requirements, or the chore of code maintenance. The list is lengthy – supplementary data for the study includes more than 200 pet peeves – but chances are any knowledge worker would confess to similar sources of frustration. The result of these irritations for developers, as they describe them, are things that most organizations would prefer to avoid. They include internal consequences like diminished mental performance, anxiety, low self-esteem, depression, and lack of motivation. They also include external consequences like low productivity, low code quality, and even code deletion as an expression of frustration. So while it may seem absurd to pamper developers with on-site meals, massages, and other lavish workplace benefits, software companies aren't all that different from big budget Hollywood film sets where a star's tantrum can cost a production millions through delays.

At first, the veracity of the nomination remained unclear. Trump had just declared Neil Gorsuch, a lover of freedom, liberty and the death penalty, as his nominee. The judge was in the middle of delivering a sincere and grateful speech when Kanye leapt from the front row and seized the microphone. “Yo, Neil, I’m really happy for you, I’ma let you finish, but I just wanted to say Antonin Scalia was one of the best justices of all time!” Kanye exclaimed. “And I still think I am the greatest at judging and making decisions.” Kanye reportedly spent $50 million on in-app purchases through his wife’s mobile-device game, Kim Kardashian: Hollywood. Gorsuch’s eyes widened in confusion as he whispered frantically to Trump. The president, though, shooed him away and patted Kanye on the back before engaging him in a firm handshake while mouthing, “Great job. Great job.” Resuming control of the microphone, Trump pointed at Kanye and pronounced, “Look at my African-American Supreme Court justice over here!” Trump went on to praise the musician as the perfect successor to the late Justice Antonin Scalia. “They’re basically the same person,” Trump said. Giving a thumbs-up to the crowd, he continued, “I like being unpredictable. That’s what we need. A more unpredictable world.” Kanye then praised himself in a series of disjointed remarks. “I am Earl Warren in the flesh,” Kanye claimed. “But just because I’m a judge don’t mean I’ma kiss your baby. I ain’t kissin’ no mothafuckin’ babies.” He also requested that, henceforth, the press refer to him as “the Honorable Yeezus.” Asked about his views on the Constitution and whether he is an originalist, Kanye vigorously nodded his head. “I’m an original artist. I’m Andy Warhol. And Walt Disney. And Google.” Offering the verses “If my manager insults me again I will be assaulting him / After I fuck the manager up then I’m gonna shorten the register up” as emblematic of his approach to labor rights, Kanye indicated he would quote his rap lyrics in judicial opinions. Legal scholars remain divided over Kanye’s judicial qualifications. “I look forward to hearing him rap from the bench,” said Scott Baio, who considers himself an amateur scholar of jurisprudence after attending several community education classes on “what to do if the cops pull you over while you’re driving drunk.” In contrast, the American Bar Association issued an unusually brief statement in response to the nomination: “fml.” Kanye refuted any criticisms of his inexperience: “I’m just trying to be a judge. I ain’t trying to be president.” Meanwhile, Kanye’s potential future colleagues on the Supreme Court expressed a range of emotions over his nomination. Interrupting his thrice daily nap, Clarence Thomas LAW ’74 said he preferred Chris Brown to Kanye. Stephen Breyer, on the other hand, excitedly recited, “I’ve got 99 problems and Kanye ain’t one!” At this, Ruth Bader Ginsburg shook her head and mumbled something about “my turf.” She then laced up her Air Jordans and flipped the bird to a crowd of reporters. Republican Congressional leaders threw their support behind the president’s nominee. “He seems absolutely capable and I trust the president’s judgement,” Speaker of the House Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said. He then began laughing uncontrollably and had to be escorted away by aides as tears dribbled down his cheeks. Trump and Kanye originally met at Trump Tower in December. Kanye said he was initially skeptical about Trump’s record on race relations, but was won over when the president used the word “multicultural,” discussed his friendship with Frederick Douglass and referred to Kanye as “a fantastic rapper of fantastic lyrics about fantastic things.” They then explored values they hold in common, including hyperbole, objectification of women and general delusion regarding reality. The two also apparently bonded over their shared disdain for reading. Kanye confessed, “I am a proud nonreader of books. I would never want a book’s autograph.” Trump nodded, puckering his lips so they resembled a clenched anus. “I don’t care for books,” Trump said. “I really don’t. I only like certain books, very good books. I read a spectacular book once about this guy’s struggles and about how much he hated communism and weak leaders and Jews. I can’t remember what it was called, something German. I love the Germans; they’re one of the most intelligent people.” Trump said he decided on Kanye as his Supreme Court pick after minutes of deliberation. Other candidates who made his short list included Sarah Palin, Gary Busey and Big Bird. However, the president ultimately decided to save these candidates for later, and potentially more combative, Supreme Court nominations, when their resilience and unanimous regard would prove advantageous. “Joan Rivers will make nice addition to Supreme Court when that rascal Ginsburg dies!” Trump tweeted. The president briefly considered holding the nomination ceremony during halftime at the Super Bowl. This option was ultimately rejected, though, when Trump noted the game might be “rigged,” especially given the involvement of Bill Belichick and the New England Patriots. He also fretted about the possibility of meeting Lady Gaga, whose “crazy eyes,” meat dresses and uterus “freak him out.” When asked about Gorsuch’s involvement and his peculiar dismissal, the president furrowed his brows and replied, “Who?” Gorsuch, for his part, remained gracious, though he admitted, “This hardly seems real. It’s like I’m living in an alternate reality.” [Note: If you think this is a real news article, you probably voted for Gary Johnson. Or you might even be Gary Johnson.

UPDATE 3FEB 0900 GMT – It has now emerged that Kalanick has resigned from Trump’s business advisory group. In an email to Uber staff he said: “Earlier today I spoke briefly with the President about the immigration executive order and its issues for our community. I also let him know that I would not be able to participate on his economic council. Joining the group was not meant to be an endorsement of the President or his agenda but unfortunately it has been misinterpreted to be exactly that.” Firstly, how to diplomatically raise the issue (see above) of the US president’s travel ban on people from seven predominantly Muslim countries, a promise he made on Facebook earlier this week after the hashtag #DeleteUber‬‬‬ trended to the top of Twitter. Secondly, and perhaps more interestingly, whether the social media storm of this past week has any real implications for Uber’s position in the ground transportation market. Just to recap, Uber’s misconduct – in the eyes of its anti-Trump users  – was a misjudged tweet posted shortly before a strike called by New York Taxi Workers Alliance, whose members include 19,000 largely Muslim and immigrant members. The union had urged all drivers in the city – including those of the iconic yellow cabs, as well as Uber and Lyft  – to put the brakes on service to-and-from JFK for an hour last Saturday evening ‘in defense of the oppressed’. But two hours before the strike got under way, Uber turned to Twitter to inform riders that it was dropping surge pricing but would continue to send drivers to JFK.   This sparked outrage among Uber’s anti-Trump followers who accused it of choosing to ‘profit off refugees being consigned to hell’ and called on people to delete the app, a storm that quickly spread to other social media platforms. Kalanick was already feeling the heat for his decision to sit on Trump’s business advisory board, a move he defended “in the belief that by speaking up and engaging we can make a difference”. Kalanick is one of numerous high-profile chief executives to agree to this including Tesla’s Elon Musk, General Motors’ Mary Barra, Pepsi’s Indra Nooyi, Disney’s Bob Iger and Jack Welch, the former chairman of General Electric. To be fair, Uber moved quickly to mitigate the damage, including a tweet that said it had not intended to break the strike, would compensate drivers caught on the wrong side of the border and would raise the issue with Trump at the meeting tomorrow. But that did not stop large numbers of users deleting the app, a process Uber was forced to automate by Monday evening, according to the New York Times, after it faced more criticism that this was unnecessarily difficult to do. By Monday, reports came out that  rival Lyft had surpassed Uber to become the fourth most downloaded free travel app in the App store [though the same wasn’t true on Google Play]. Lyft had pledged to donate $1million to the American Civil Liberties Union and said it would ‘not be silent on issues that threaten the values of our community’. But things are never quite as straightforward as they seem. The #DeleteUber‬‬‬ camp seems to have missed that financier Carl Icahn, who invested $100 million in Lyft, was an early and vocal supporter of Trump on the election trail. In response to this criticism, Lyft is reported to have said: “We don’t always agree with our investors and aren’t afraid to say so. We do respect their right, and that of every American, to freedom of expression”. What does a business stand for? While many social media experts argue that the #deleteuber storm will likely blow over within a few days, it raises some interesting dilemmas for consumer-facing travel businesses. Del Ross, a senior advisor to consultancy firm McKinsey, has this to say: “For a long time, companies avoided having a point of view. Not so anymore, but that’s not necessarily a Trump thing. “Today companies are not evaluated or perceived on what they do but what they are about. You have an articulated position on your role in the universe, aside from the service you provide. “There is a risk to that but it is something we are going to see a lot more of as we move increasingly beyond a purely transactional mindset.” It could be argued that Uber’s position last Saturday was that people needed transportation and it wasn’t helping anybody to disrupt the ability of travellers to get to and from the airport. Fair enough? Perhaps. But risky too! Admittedly though, this isn’t the first time that Uber hasn’t been the centre of controversy. “Uber ignore most things, including the law, that’s their style,” says Jodie Cook, MD of JC Social Media, one of Forbes’ 2017 30 under 30 social entrepreneurs in Europe. The big question now is will the social media uproar have any implications for Uber’s business? Bill Beckler, cofounder of metasearch alltherooms.com and former director of innovation at lastminute.com, has this to say: “This Uber story has powerful implications for the future of ground transportation. First, Uber’s business model, which involves incurring heavy losses now in the hope that ‘market clout’ will pay back in the future, assumes that there is a momentum effect based on their market share. “This assumption is refuted if people are willing to switch to Lyft based on Uber’s ‘morality’ issues. “If switching is so easy for customers, and the companies are viewed as comparable today – even though Uber is 10x bigger – then it is game over for this ‘market clout’ concept. “I think a lot of people are realising that Uber won’t be a monopoly; this recent incident is another data point proving just that.” Whose side are you on? Some big names in travel have taken stands on the Trump travel ban –  Expedia has called it ‘detrimental to business’: TripAdvisor has said it is ‘heartless and discriminatory’; Airbnb has offered ‘free housing to refugees and anyone not allowed in the US’. AllTheRooms has also come out publicly against the travel restrictions and has created a Facebook forum – Travelers for Open Borders – ‘for travelers and travel industry professionals to collaborate around open borders’. Priceline, however, has remained notably schtum, as have most travel suppliers including hotel chains and airlines. Despite widespread anti-Trump sentiment, there are polls showing that 49% of US citizens support the ban compared with 41% that are opposed to it. Their reluctance to comment is arguably with good reason, as Starbucks has shown. #BoycottStarbucks also trended to the top of Twitter this week after the coffee-shop chain angered pro-Trump customers with its promise to employ 15,000 refugees. So are there any lessons for travel companies in all of this? When it comes to a negative publicity on social media – as Uber faced this week – Cook has this advice: “In the vast majority of cases, remaining silent and waiting for the storm to pass is best practice, from a PR perspective, especially as any statement given is likely to create more negative responses. It’s pretty much like pleading the 5th amendment.” Having said that, these are hardly ordinary times, and for Beckler remaining silent isn’t enough. “Trump has shown time and again that he is arbitrary and enforces grudges but that is all the more reason for principled people to take public stands, otherwise we descend into tyranny.” From a household name such as Uber, the public is right to expect an official response and on this CEO Kalanick delivered. Tomorrow, if he is to deliver on what he promised angry users earlier this week he will need to dig deep and draw on his experience of “working with governments and politicians of all political persuasions…to effect change from within through persuasion and argument”. Given Trump’s uncompromising moves of the past week, he’ll need more than the best of luck. In the meantime, the race for consumer loyalty between the iconic yellow cabbies, Uber, Lyft and others, in places such as New York and elsewhere, is on.

"You must read it." I'm trying to concentrate on getting together a packet of papers. "Don't disturb me, please," I say. I've got to apply for a visa to Europe because I'm supposed to attend a conference in April. Some people are good at filling up forms. I am not. The only parts of any form that I like to fill are my date of birth and full name. Why? Because these are the only bits of my life that I am absolutely sure of. Everything else is uncertain. "But it would change your life, this book!" insists Bins. I lift my head up. "You're not even reading it!" I say. "You're only listening to it on Kindle!" He shakes his head. "No! Not Kindle. Audible. It's from Google. Really great. You would like it." I can't tell whether he means I'd like Audible, or audio books in general or the contents of this particular audio book. "Please! I'm trying to remember whether my permanent address is a philosophical question." Who has a really permanent address, after all? Even if you're chained to the floor in a maximum security cell, serving out a life-sentence, you will eventually cease to exist and thus leave that address behind. "It's called LAB GIRL. By Hope Jahren. She must be very beautiful. Like a leaf." This last statement is so weird, that I have to stop filling the form. "What the hiccup are you talking about?" I ask. Naturally, he can't let that pass. "Hiccup? What hiccup?" he wants to know. So I have to explain, laboriously, that I am trying to avoid all forms of profanity, even such harmless words as "heck". Meanwhile on Page Three of the form I'm trying to fill there's a question about whether or not I've ever visited Europe. In case I have, it wants me to list all the dates, times, and places I went to while I was there, restaurants I ate at, beds I slept in, diseases I contracted, drugs that I sold, weapons of mass destruction that I smuggled in. "The way the author describes a leaf," explains Bins, "is so beautiful that it makes me thinks she must also be beautiful." My mind meanwhile is full of angrily buzzing thoughts. I can barely hear a word of what he says. Yes, I know why visa forms are designed to be like torture chambers for the mind: it's to prevent undesirables from traveling across international borders. Sadly, however, these forms are designed by the very people they're trying to keep out! Torturers!Murderers! Terrorists! I give up on the form and listen instead to the audio book Bins wants me to hear. "Leaves make sugar," says the author, reading her own book out. "Plants are the only things in the Universe that can make sugar out of non-living inorganic matter. All the sugar you have ever eaten was first made within a leaf." I have to agree with Bins: "The author must be very beautiful," I say. I can always fill up that hiccuping form some other time. "Let's go out and hug a leaf. Let's adopt a forest." Thank goodness for authors who can remind us of what really matters in life! Leaves. And sugar.

News Business Business News Snapshot has taken the first step to listing publicly, but its giving little away to investors The number of Snap's daily active users grew to an average of 158 million at the end of December, up 48 per cent year-on-year Lauren Hirsch, Liana B. Baker Friday 3 February 2017 07:37 BST Click to follow The Independent Online It isn't the first time Snapchat has faced criticism for its filters LIONEL BONAVENTURE/AFP/Getty Images Snapchat owner Snap shot the opening salvo in its $3bn initial public offering on Thursday, outlining aggressive expansion plans but offering new investors no say on how the company is run and no promise of profits. Read more Snap Inc is a beast that should worry Facebook shareholder Snap's publication on Thursday of its IPO registration document sets the stage for its upcoming marketing campaign to convince investors to look past its widening losses and the firm grip of its founders, and focus on its rapid growth of active users. The number of Snap's daily active users grew to an average of 158 million at the end of December, up 48 per cent year-on-year, Snap revealed. However, its net loss widened to $514.6m in 2016 from $372.9m the year before. While Snap will have time to polish its marketing pitch in the run-up to the IPO planned for March, some analysts were taken aback that the company was just beginning to reap cash from its product. "What surprises me the most is that it is still very early days when it comes to Snap making money," said Rohit Kulkarni, managing director at private securities investment firm SharesPost. Read more Snapchat Spectacles case melts while charging, echoing Note 7 recall Facebook is making Instagram Stories a main part of its app Newspapers cut Facebook and Snapchat content due to meagre returns What not to do on social media when you're going through a break-up Snap had confidentially registered with the US Securities and Exchange Commission for an IPO late last year. It kept the filing under such tight wraps, even some of its IPO underwriters had not seen it prior to publication on Thursday, sources familiar with the matter previously told Reuters. Snap said in the IPO registration document published on Thursday it would become the first US company to go public with shares on offer not granting voting rights to stock market investors. Its founders, Evan Spiegel and Robert Murphy, will keep control of the company. Snap could be valued at between $20bn to $25bn, according to sources familiar with the situation who asked not to be named because the matter is confidential. That would give the company the richest valuation in a US technology IPO since Facebook. Snap, which launched itself in 2012 with an app that sends disappearing messages, rebranded itself last year as a camera company and started selling $130 video camera glasses. It generates the majority of its revenue from advertising, seeking to challenge the dominance of internet giants such as Facebook and Alphabet’s Google.

Photo credit: The first Dell EMC VEX Robotics tournament of the 2016/17 season, held at the Bishopstown GAA Club and hosted by Coláiste an Spioraid Naoimh. Some 130 secondary school pupils from 13 schools in Cork, Limerick and Waterford took part. The the national finals in Cork see students compete with their self-built robots completing a number of challenging tasks. The Dell EMC VEX Robotics initiative promotes STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) learning. Picture: Daragh Mc Sweeney/Provision “Only a decade ago, mobile internet was a novelty and mostly impractical; now, sites like Facebook report that 90% of its one billion daily active users access the site from a mobile device. In 2006, broadband penetration in Ireland was just over 8%; in 2016, that figure was more than 83%, and that’s excluding mobile networks capable of similar speeds.” New advancements in hardware and internet connectivity are fast-tracking what some call the ‘Fourth Industrial Revolution’. “Previously ‘analogue’ objects — everyday items that we never considered would or ever needed to go online — like kitchen appliances, machines, vehicles and even clothes, are connecting to the internet en masse, creating virtual tons of useful information. “This so-called ‘Internet of Things’, or ‘Internet of Everything’, is a rapidly accelerating expansion of the internet on an unprecedented scale and has serious significance for businesses and households across the world,” said Mr Savage. The Internet of Things is already making its way into our homes. “The Google Home — an internet-connected ‘smart remote’ — connects to your other smart devices, allowing you to adjust your thermostat, control your lights and order a taxi from the comfort of your living room sofa using only your voice. Samsung’s Family Hub, a ‘smart fridge’ with a wi-fi enabled touch-screen, connects to the internet and can automatically order food, suggest recipes and notify you of your groceries’ expiry dates before you head home,” he explains. For industry, the Internet of Things opens up vast new frontiers of business intelligence, increased efficiency, productivity and globally competitive costs. “Consider the opportunities for Ireland’s agrifood sector. Internet-connected sensors on farm machinery and Wi-Fi tags on livestock can collect useful data, meaning more efficient use of land, water, feed, fuel and other resources. Data analysis is also helping farmers to more accurately forecast the weather, measure soil conditions and protect against disease. As the planet’s appetite grows, food production, and many other industries, will depend on the precision of data-driven predictions and insight.” In Ireland, at sites in Dublin, Cork and Limerick, Dell EMC works closely with a number of businesses and organisations developing the next generation of IoT products and services. “One of the most interesting — and important—is ‘Bluelight’, a system that allows hospitals to track their ambulances and paramedics with sensors, plan their routes in advance, and monitor patients’ conditions en route so doctors are prepared for their arrival. “This is just one advancement that will have radical positive effects on essential, life-saving infrastructure. Every industry, every service and every process can be transformed in this way, and they will be in the years ahead.” As more people and businesses connect to the internet using more devices, and more objects connect to the internet for the first time, the size of the internet will grow exponentially, he explains. “In 2006, there were two billion internet-enabled devices on Earth. Our ‘digital footprint’ that year, the amount of digital data generated globally, was 161 ‘exabytes’, almost 172 billion gigabytes. By 2020, 25 billion devices will be connected to the internet, generating more than 44 ‘zettabytes’— or 44 trillion gigabytes — of information. Businesses, economies and governments will struggle not to be overwhelmed. It’s important that Ireland’s are as resilient as possible, and to do that, we must strive to create a flexible, knowledgeable workforce ready to tackle a fast-changing world of technology driven by the Internet of Things.” “Ireland has an excellent track record of attracting large tech multinationals, and to continue that, we must prioritise their supply of skilled graduates. The importance of investment in STEM education cannot be overstated, and we plan on working closely with the Government to help enact its Action Plan for Education, which seeks to make Ireland the best place in Europe for education and skills training by 2026. The plan’s new computer science course will be especially valuable; like the tech industry, it must be readily adaptable and changed regularly so it meets contemporary demands.” “Our technological infrastructure must also grow apace,” he concludes. “While our broadband coverage is improving, there remain many parts of the country with antiquated internet connections. This will harm long-term business development, especially in rural areas, and will make it difficult to adopt more efficient Internet of Things technology, slowing growth. The tectonic plates of established politics and economics are shifting fast. “Earthquakes like Brexit, combined with exciting advances in technology, present Ireland with an historic opportunity to play a leading role in the industries changing the face of the world,” he said. “Our infrastructure, our businesses and our education system must be prepared for this digital transformation.” Interview: John Daly READ MORE Visit the section home page here KEYWORDS business, America, Ireland, internet, technology © Irish Examiner Ltd.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Friday, 3 February 2017 | MYT 1:12 PM Facebook vulnerable to expected changes in key visa programme Vulnerable: More than 15% of Facebook's US employees in 2016 used a temporary work visa, giving the social media leader a legal classification as a H-1B “dependent” company. — Reuters SAN FRANCISCO/WASHINGTON: Among Silicon Valley’s top tech employers, Facebook Inc could be the most vulnerable to US President Donald Trump’s expected crackdown on guest-worker visas, according to a Reuters analysis of US Labour Department filings.  More than 15% of Facebook's US employees in 2016 used a temporary work visa, giving the social media leader a legal classification as a H-1B “dependent” company. That is a higher proportion than Alphabet Inc's Google, Apple Inc, Amazon.com Inc or Microsoft Corp.  That could cause problems for Facebook if Trump or Congress decide to make the H-1B programme more restrictive, as the president and some Republican lawmakers have threatened to do.  Both Trump and Attorney General nominee Senator Jeff Sessions have opposed the programme in its current form. They have also indicated that they are open to reforming it to “ensure the beneficiaries of the programme are the best and the brightest,” according to a draft executive order seen by Reuters. Reuters could not immediately confirm the authenticity of the draft.  The Trump administration has not proposed any new rules that would target companies with the H-1B "dependent" classification. But the fact that Facebook alone among major tech companies falls into that category suggests it is the most exposed in the industry to any changes in H-1B visa policy.  Facebook declined to comment on the matter.  Trump administration officials could not immediately be reached for comment. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said on Jan 30 that Trump would target H-1B visas as part of a larger immigration reform effort through executive orders and Congressional action, but gave no details.  H-1B visas are intended for foreign nationals in "specialty" occupations that generally require higher education, which according to US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) includes, but is not limited to, scientists, engineers or computer programmers. The government awards 85,000 every year, chiefly through a lottery system.  Companies say they use them to recruit top talent. But a majority of the visas are awarded to outsourcing firms, sparking criticism by sceptics that those firms use the visas to fill lower-level information technology jobs. Critics also say the lottery system benefits outsourcing firms that flood the system with mass applications.  H-1B dependent status is mostly held by these outsourcing firms such as India's Tata Consultancy Services or Infosys. The status was introduced in the late 1990s in an effort to ensure that companies did not use the visas to replace American workers with cheaper foreign labour. The status requires companies to prove they cannot find US workers for the jobs.  Facebook listed itself as a dependent company in its applications for H-1B visas with the Labour Department last year.  Before he took office as president, Trump discussed changes to the H-1B visa programme with top technology executives, including Facebook chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg.  Those changes included possibly ending the lottery and replacing it with a system that would award the visas to the highest-paying jobs first, a move designed to reduce their issuance to outsourcing firms.  Such a move could soften the blow from any H-1B changes for Facebook and other major technology companies. The average salary offered for Facebook H-1B jobs was US$145,550 (RM644,131), according to its application filings last year. Tata, a traditional outsourcing firm, offered US$67,950 (RM300,712) on average, barely above the US$60,000 (RM265,530) floor set by law for the H-1B programme.  The draft executive order did not mention specifics about the lottery. It did require the US secretary of labour to provide the president with a report on “the actual or potential injury to US workers caused, directly or indirectly, by work performed by non-immigrant workers in the H-1B” visa programme.  “We are hoping that the final draft will have more details,” said Russell Harrison, director of government relations at IEEE-USA, a group that represents US engineers and favours that H-1B reform. — Reuters You May Be Interested Uber CEO quits Trump’s business advisory group Amazon projects spending that concerns investors watching profit Mobile gaming is box office business Microsoft asks for exception programme on Trump orders Nintendo plays with fire as new mobile game takes ‘gacha’ global Is it time to say ‘goodbye’ to Google Allo?

Credit: Blair Hanley Frank More like this Cloud growth continues for Microsoft Cloud growth boosts Microsoft's financials Microsoft gets unexpected bump in Windows revenue Video Getting a bead on tech trends for 2017 The rocketship of cloud growth continued at the end of 2016 for Amazon Web Services. The public cloud provider announced Thursday that it brought in a little more than $3.5 billion during the fourth quarter of the year, up 47 percent from the same period in 2015. Quarterly operating income rose 60 percent to $926 million, compared to $580 million during the prior year quarter.  That's nothing to sneeze at, but AWS's revenue growth was the lowest it has been in the past two years. There are a number of potential explanations for that, including seasonal changes in cloud migrations, and difficulty driving increased growth on larger and larger total revenue. Continuing growth is a positive sign for AWS, which is locked in tight competition with companies including Microsoft and Google to try and power the next generation of business applications. Amazon said AWS launched 1,019 new features in 2016 as part of that push. Microsoft’s Intelligent Cloud revenue segment brought in $6.9 billion in revenue during the same period. However, that also includes revenue from sources beyond its Azure cloud platform, including licenses for software including Windows Server and SQL Server. A series of price cuts for AWS services kicked in during the quarter. Amazon CFO Brian Olsavsky said on a conference call with financial analysts that such cuts are "going to be a constant in this business." It's unclear exactly what impact they may have had on the cloud provider's overall financial results.  Overall, Amazon's fourth quarter revenue was $43.7 billion, up 22 percent from $35.7 billion at the end of 2015. The company's fourth quarter profit was $749 million, compared to $482 million during the prior year quarter.  To express your thoughts on Computerworld content, visit Computerworld's Facebook page, LinkedIn page and Twitter stream.

The Firefox browser won't be coming to a connected TV near you any time soon, thanks to the Mozilla Foundation's decision to lay off the employees of its connected device division. The non-profit browser maker, which has weathered intense competition from Google and Microsoft in recent years, once saw mobile devices and the gadgets that make up the Internet of Things (IoT) as fertile ground for expansion beyond the desktop browser market, even introducing a dedicated Firefox OS for connected TVs (pictured above). Mozilla is now eliminating most of the team responsible for that exploration, CNET reported on Thursday. Around 50 of the foundation's 1,000 employees will leave, including Senior Vice President for Connected Devices Ari Jaaski. The layoffs mean that Mozilla won't soon launch any new commercial software for consumer IoT devices, although the company said that it intends to continue its IoT research. Related Mozilla Looks Beyond Firefox OS to the Internet of Things Mozilla Looks Beyond Firefox OS to the Internet of Things "We have shifted our internal approach to the internet-of-things opportunity to step back from a focus on launching and scaling commercial products to one focused on research and advanced development, dissolving our connected devices initiative and incorporating our internet-of-things explorations into an increased focus on emerging technologies," Mozilla said in a statement to CNET. One of those technologies is Project Quantum, a next-generation Web engine designed to harness the multiple processor cores that are increasingly showing up in smartphones and other mobile devices. The layoffs come one year after the foundation abandoned a similar effort to bring Firefox to smartphones. Somewhat ironically, that pivot that was intended to pave the way for the connected device offerings that Mozilla is now abandoning.

There’s a spice rack I bought online in November sitting there gathering dust that’s needing hung up. In fact, all my spices and herbs are sitting in an temperamental cabinet, or should I say an old Adidas shoe box on the kitchen worktop. My girlfriend is having none of it. She thinks we are living like jakies. I agree to an extent. I have an “office” which is a mess. Well, when I say office, it’s just my spare room wae a computer in it. I’ve took a page out of Donald Trump’s book and banned her from going in there. Not because I think she will commit a terrorist attack in there but I know she’ll start a war once she sees the dozen Creme Egg wrappers lying on the floor. Read More I got blanked by Robert Carlyle for calling him Boaby but I felt like luckiest man on the world at T2 Trainspotting premiere The thing is, that spice rack will probably still be lying there at Easter 2019. Look, I’m not going to lie. Manual labour isn’t my strongpoint. I struggle with it big time. I’ve had to get a lollipop woman stick on a spare tyre for me in the past. I’m not proud. Any situation without a keyboard or Google and I’m as confused as a goat on Astroturf. My brother once told me while shifting wood out his back garden that I was worse than working with a man-doon. That was probably because I hid in the toilet for half an hour kidding on I was no’ well. What can I say? I don’t do skelfs. Grado's got no thyme to assemble a spice rack I usually get my brother to help me with stuff that involves a drill or nails, so on Monday I phoned him to come round and help me with this spice rack. The problem when me and my brother get together is nothing ends up getting done because we just spend all day eating. Within five minutes of him coming to my door, we got talking about scoff and the spice rack was well ditched. We went to one of my favourite places to eat just now – Elliots in Prestwick. My bro took a wee notion for seafood and ordered the crab tempura. I knew he would regret it. When it came, it was just a crab, with its legs and heid still intact, dipped in batter. I don’t like when my food is shaped like the animal it’s meant to be. It freaks me out. Other than that, the meal was five stars. Anywhere that does a side of mac ’n’ cheese I have a lot of respect for. Read More TV star Grado backs campaign to keep ferry service in North Ayrshire When we got back to mines, I’d forgot I even had a spice rack. We stuck the telly on and watched a documentary about “The Guv’nor” Lenny Mclean, the underground boxer and bouncer who was billed as the hardest man in Britain back in the day. This film was meant to show you another side of the big man – how he was partial to a cream cake and how he loved visiting his wee granny. But it’s a bit hard to take your mind off the fact he bit through his best mate’s windpipe and chewed human flesh as though it was chuggy. I could probably still take him, though. The film was bizarrely interrupted when I received a phone call from a man in Austria. When I was at Elliots with my brother earlier in the day, I was putting up the pictures of our munch on Instagram and apparently when people clicked into my profile, my mobile phone was displaying for everyone to see. Fair play to Emmerich Suchentrunk, who gave me a bell to give me a heids up. Don’t get me a wrong, it was a lovely gesture but I couldn’t get him aff the phone. “You are de greatest wrestlers in Europes”. Cheers mate. This isn’t the first time something like this has happened either. I once put a video on YouTube with my phone number showing in the background and ended up with about 40 text messages to my phone asking “Is this YERSEL?”. Later that night, my girlfriend came back from her work and suddenly I remembered I had a spice rack to put up. She went through me for the place being a mess, living room no being hoovered, dishes still in the sink and, of course, the spice rack. When asked why it was still lying there, I told her: “Here, I’ve no had the thyme!” Read More Top news stories today Dig begins in search for Lisa Brown Mum's horror of Fife dog attack The millionaire and the hitman haggler Suicide teen's cires for help ignored Like us on Facebook Follow us on Twitter Daily Newsletter Follow @Daily_Record Subscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribe Comments Show more comments More On Grado Donald Trump News all Most Read Most Recent NewsReason why EastEnders isn't airing on Friday revealed - so fans have to wait a little longer for outcome of revenge porn plot Fans have been glued to their screens all week - but have to wait until Monday for the next episode because of Spy In The Wild JusticeSpanish cops call in diggers to search for Scottish mum as tip-off sparks fresh hunt for missing expat Lisa Brown vanished from her Spain home 15 months ago and her partner has been held in jail on suspicion of killing her since April last year.

By Agamoni Ghosh February 3, 2017 06:02 GMT A snap banner on the NYSE buildingReuters Snap Inc, the parent company of messaging app Snapchat, filed an initial public offering with the Securities and Exchange Commission on 2 February (Thursday). The company's shares will be traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) with the ticker "SNAP" and it aims to raise $3bn (£2.4bn) through its IPO. IBTimes UK brings all the necessary information about the company and its big debut on Wall Street that you need know: What is Snapchat? Snap's main product Snapchat is a social media app through which users send and view "snaps" that last only for a while. The company makes money from ads on this platform and content created by third-party channels such as news organisations and content creators. Other than the app the company has introduced an augmented reality glasses called Snapchat Specs, which recently got payment feature called Snapcash. However, the Bluetooth video-taking glasses have failed to do much for the company's revenues and in its filings the company said, "We have limited manufacturing experience." What are the main financials involved? Snap could be valued anywhere around $20bn to $25bn, according to sources close to the matter although its last private market valuation stood close to $18bn. If it nears the $25bn mark it would give the company the richest valuation in a US technology IPO since Facebook Inc. The majority of Snap's revenue in 2016, 98%, came from advertising and although it is growing its losses are also increasing by the day. Net losses grew to $514.6m in 2016, compared with a net loss of $372.9 million in 2015. Snap's biggest losses stems from "hosting fees" which it pays to cloud computing companies such as Google to use their infrastructure for its data. It is expected to pay Google over $2bn the next five years to use its cloud computing services. What are the current user engagement numbers like? As of December 31, 2016, Snapchat has 161 million daily active users who spend around 25 to 30 minutes a day in its app. More than 2.5 billion snaps are created every day and users visit Snapchat more than 18 times a day on an average. The app's user base grew by 50 million daily active users in 2016, but growth slowed considerably at the tail end of the year as it managed to garner only 5 million users in Q4 2016. Snap blamed the slower daily active user rate in the second half on a number of factors but mainly to the failure to introduce product updates in mid-2016 which may have led to performance issues. Snapchat and its competition Instagram, the Facebook-owned social network that spans over 400 million users, is Snapchat's biggest threat right now. Instagram's recent launch of Instagram Stories directly takes on Snapchat Stories feature. "Our business is highly competitive," the company said in its filing. "We face significant competition that we anticipate will continue to intensify." Like Twitter, Snap is facing the same problem of losing out on users and failing to tap new users. However, Snap has started to figure out how to generate meaningful revenue from its users. Talking about Facebook, the platform is an unfair comparison to Snapchat given the former has a lot more to offer than just snap features. Right now Facebook has the highest user base, almost nearing the 2 billion mark for monthly users. Also Snapchat is only about five years old as against Facebook, which has been in the market since 2004. More from IBTimes UK Is Snapchat really worth $25 billion?

More than 15 percent of Facebook's US employees in 2016 used a temporary work visa, giving the social media leader a legal classification as a H-1B “dependent” company. That is a higher proportion than Alphabet Inc.'s Google, Apple Inc., Amazon.com Inc. or Microsoft Corp. That could cause problems for Facebook if Trump or Congress decide to make the H-1B program more restrictive, as the president and some Republican lawmakers have threatened to do. Both Trump and Attorney General nominee Senator Jeff Sessions have opposed the program in its current form. They have also indicated that they are open to reforming it to “ensure the beneficiaries of the program are the best and the brightest,” according to a draft executive order seen by Reuters. Reuters could not immediately confirm the authenticity of the draft. The Trump administration has not proposed any new rules that would target companies with the H-1B "dependent" classification. But the fact that Facebook alone among major tech companies falls into that category suggests it is the most exposed in the industry to any changes in H-1B visa policy. Facebook declined to comment on the matter. Trump administration officials could not immediately be reached for comment. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said on Monday that Trump would target H-1B visas as part of a larger immigration reform effort through executive orders and Congressional action, but gave no details. H-1B visas are intended for foreign nationals in "specialty" occupations that generally require higher education, which according to US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) includes, but is not limited to, scientists, engineers or computer programmers. The government awards 85,000 every year, chiefly through a lottery system. Companies say they use them to recruit top talent. But a majority of the visas are awarded to outsourcing firms, sparking criticism by skeptics that those firms use the visas to fill lower-level information technology jobs. Critics also say the lottery system benefits outsourcing firms that flood the system with mass applications. H-1B dependent status is mostly held by these outsourcing firms such as India's Tata Consultancy Services or Infosys. The status was introduced in the late 1990s in an effort to ensure that companies did not use the visas to replace American workers with cheaper foreign labor. The status requires companies to prove they cannot find US workers for the jobs. Facebook listed itself as a dependent company in its applications for H-1B visas with the Labor Department last year. Before he took office as president, Trump discussed changes to the H-1B visa program with top technology executives, including Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg. Those changes included possibly ending the lottery and replacing it with a system that would award the visas to the highest-paying jobs first, a move designed to reduce their issuance to outsourcing firms. Such a move could soften the blow from any H-1B changes for Facebook and other major technology companies. The average salary offered for Facebook H-1B jobs was $145,550, according to its application filings last year. Tata, a traditional outsourcing firm, offered $67,950 on average, barely above the $60,000 floor set by law for the H-1B program. The draft executive order did not mention specifics about the lottery. It did require the U.S. secretary of labor to provide the president with a report on “the actual or potential injury to U.S. workers caused, directly or indirectly, by work performed by nonimmigrant workers in the H-1B” visa program. “We are hoping that the final draft will have more details,” said Russell Harrison, director of government relations at IEEE-USA, a group that represents U.S. engineers and favors that H-1B reform.

Dylan Michael Lanc-Quin pleaded guilty in Adelaide Magistrates Court on Friday to causing death by dangerous driving and leaving the scene of an accident. Harley Chester, 28, died at the scene after he was struck by a station wagon in suburban Largs North in February 2016. The victim's twin sister Tarita Chester said it meant a lot that Lanc-Quin had taken responsibility for causing her brother's death. "I was really happy to hear that. This has made my day really," she said outside court. "It won't bring Harley back but it's taking responsibility, which means a lot to the family." Ms Chester said she misses her brother and it's been tough not having him around. "It's not easy losing my twin," she said. "He was still only very young."

PHOTO: REUTERS The parent of the fast-growing social network Snapchat filed public documents for a share offering Thursday, seeking to raise up to $3 billion in a keenly anticipated Wall Street debut. California-based Snap Inc, which had earlier filed confidential documents for an initial public offering, was expected to be one of the biggest tech company IPOs in recent years with a valuation likely to top $20 billion. In documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Snap said it took in $404 million in revenue last year but lost $515 million. Stepping Down: Sony’s chief leaves to focus on Snapchat Snapchat, known for its disappearing messages, has become hugely popular with young smartphone users. But the company has recently been expanding its offerings to allow publishers to deliver content through the platform. According to the filing, 158 million people use Snapchat daily, and over 2.5 billion Snaps are created every day. Snapchat has partnerships with dozens of publishers and organisations, including one announced Thursday by the New York Times. Snapchat said it expects to derive most of its revenue from advertising, where it will compete against rivals such as Google, Facebook and Twitter. The company noted that since its inception it has been losing money and “may not achieve or maintain profitability.” Snapchat reportedly spurned a multibillion-dollar offer from Facebook, preferring to remain independent. Snap’s offering on the New York Stock Exchange is the largest for a technology company in the US since Chinese-based Alibaba listed in 2014. The documents did not provide share pricing and noted that the amount to be raised could be revised before the market debut, which is likely to take place in March. While some analysts say Snap has the potential to challenge Facebook, others say it could end up like Twitter, which consistently lost money and whose existence as an independent firm is in peril. Global Equities Research analyst Trip Chowdhry advised investors in a note to steer clear of the IPO, calling the value of Snap “hyper-inflated.” “We are at the tail end of social-media boom – novelty is giving way to fatigue,” Chowdhry said in the note. “Durability is absent in SnapChat – it’s the next Groupon, the next Zynga, the next GoPro, the next FitBit.” All of those company’s lost luster after public debuts accompanied by high expectations. Snapchat will be competing with throngs of smartphone apps for advertising dollars, the analyst reasoned. The Snap IPO will be structured with different share classes, allowing co-founders Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy to control 88.6 percent of the voting rights. Earlier Thursday, the New York Times said it would create a daily Edition for Snapchatters in the US, Canada and Australia based on its Morning Briefing, or summary of major news. This will appear on Discover, the section of the Snapchat app where users can find content from media companies. The Times cited data from Nielsen saying that Snapchat each day reaches 41 per cent of all 18-to 34-year-olds in the United States, compared to just six percent for US network television. The company last year hit the market with camera-equipped sunglasses called “Spectacles” and renamed itself “Snap” to show it was no longer limited to a single product. The head of Sony’s entertainment business stepped down Thursday to devote energy to Snap. The free service launched in 2012. Facebook just can’t stop copying Snapchat Michael Lynton was leaving his job running the Japan-based company’s pictures and music business as of February 2 to spend more time as chairman of the board of Snap Inc., Sony Corporation said in an earlier release. An investor in Snap, Lynton has been on the board nearly four years. He will stay on as “co-chief executive officer” of Sony Entertainment, working with Sony Corporation chief Kazuo Hirai to find a successor, according to the company.

By Alexandra Bruell Alexandra Bruell The Wall Street Journal BiographyAlexandra Bruell alexandra.bruell@wsj.com Feb. 2, 2017 1:20 p.m. ET 31 COMMENTS Brands for years have used their advertising platforms to communicate messages of female empowerment and gender equality—generally without provoking controversy. But auto maker Audi’s new Super Bowl ad, which promotes gender pay equity, has struck a nerve with some viewers since it was released on YouTube Wednesday. In the ad, dubbed “Daughter,” a father watches his daughter compete in a cart race with other children. “What do I tell my daughter?” he asks. “Do I tell her that her grandpa’s worth more than her grandma? That her dad is worth more than her mom? Do I tell her that despite her education, her drive, her skills, her intelligence, she will automatically be valued as less than every man she ever meets? Or maybe, I’ll be able to tell her something different.” The ad ends with a message on screen: “Audi of America is committed to equal pay for equal work.” The spot has amassed over 2 million views on YouTube. As of Thursday afternoon there were over 18,000 negative comments compared to around 1,110 positive ones. Some viewers were offended by the message, calling it “100% liberal trash propaganda”﻿ and “anti-male propaganda.﻿” One user wrote, “ummm…that she needs to work hard and everything is fine…as a woman I want to say…I am not a victim, don’t let your daughter feel like she is one either. And IF AUDI thinks that my father is worth more than MY Mother, maybe they should ask my father about that. NOT THE WAY I WAS RAISED IN AMERICA.﻿” Others came to the ad’s defense. Google’s Tara Walpert Levy tweeted her support of the ad. Brad Jakeman, president of PepsiCo’s global beverage group, also weighed in with praise of the spot. Networked Insights, a research firm that mines social media sites, said there have been roughly 4,580 comments made about the Audi commercial on Twitter, YouTube and other social platforms as of mid-day Thursday. About 25% of the comments have been negative while 13% have been positive. The critics of the ad are commenting that they “disliked the ad because they believed it was pure political propaganda,” and others found it to be “disingenuous coming from a brand that has never taken a stance on the topic in the past,” according to Networked Insights. Positive commentators, the research firm said, found the ad to be “uplifting and praised Audi for addressing the issue of gender.” Marketers have run a variety of high-profile gender empowerment campaigns over the years, on issues from body image to stereotypes in sports. In one ad for deodorant maker Secret for its “Stress Test” campaign, a young woman practices a speech she plans to make asking her boss for a raise. The gender pay gap has become a big issue in corporate boardrooms and politics and was a topic of debate in the 2016 presidential campaign. Women with bachelor’s degrees or higher earned 76% of their male peers in that group in 2014, according to the Labor Department. Women with less than a high-school diploma working full time earned 79% of male peers. “Audi of America is committed to supporting pay equality, inclusivity, and the growth and development of all employees,” the company said in a statement promoting the spot, which was created by Venables Bell & Partners. The Super Bowl, the biggest TV event with an audience of 100 million-plus, draws much more attention to ad campaigns. And brands that delve into social or political issues know there are risks of alienating certain segments of their customer base. Other brands whose ads intersect with hot button topics in politics and society include Kia—whose ad features Melissa McCarthy as an “eco warrior” trying to save whales and trees (the ad is for the hybrid Kia Niro )—and Budweiser, whose ad is about the immigration tale of Anheuser-Busch InBev NV’s co-founder.

By Hyacinth Mascarenhas February 3, 2017 05:27 GMT Tesla Chief Executive, Elon Musk enters the lobby of Trump Tower in Manhattan, New York, U.S., January 6, 2017.Reuters/Shannon Stapleton Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk said he will stay on two of President Donald Trump's advisory councils despite fierce public outrage and pressure to step down over the president's recent controversial immigration order. Musk's statement came just hours after Uber's chief executive Travis Kalanick quit the council on Thursday. In a lengthy statement posted on Twitter on Thursday, Musk said he and others will "express our objections to the recent executive order on immigration and offer suggestions for changes to the policy" during their first meeting on Friday. During his first week in the Oval Office, Trump signed an executive order temporarily suspending America's entire refugee programme, barring Syrian refugees indefinitely from entering and restricted immigrants from seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the US. The travel ban sparked severe backlash and triggered protests across the country and around the world. Major tech companies including Microsoft, Facebook and Google among others quickly voiced their opposition to the order and raised serious concerns over its impact to their businesses, employees and ability to competitively recruit talent from overseas. Musk, who agreed to join Trump's advisory councils in December, said that serving in the council "does not mean that I agree with actions by the Administration." "My goals are to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy and to help make humanity a multi-planet civilization, a consequence of which will be the creation of hundreds of thousands of jobs and a more inspiring future for all," Musk said. "I understand the perspective of those who object to my attending this meeting, but I believe at this time that engaging on critical issues will on balance serve the greater good." US President Donald Trump meets with business leaders in the Roosevelt Room at the White House in Washington, DC, on January 23, 2017.Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images In December, Kalanick and Musk agreed to join Trump's Strategic and Policy Forum, a 19-member economic advisory council, which also includes Pepsi CEO Indra Nooyi, Disney chief executive Bob Iger and Walmart's Doug McMillon. However, Kalanick opted to drop out of the group on Thursday following criticism from employees, customers and activists for not taking a tougher stance on the immigration order. People accused Uber of undermining a work stoppage called by the New York Taxi Workers Alliance last weekend to oppose the Muslim travel ban. Paired with Kalanick's position in Trump's economic advisory, the ride-hailing service's decision to continue operating and disable surge prices during the work stoppage led thousands of users and celebrities to pledge to #DeleteUber en masse - a hashtag that quickly went viral. "Joining the group was not meant to be an endorsement of the president or his agenda but unfortunately it has been misinterpreted to be exactly that," Kalanick said in an email to staff. "We must believe that the actions we take ultimately move the ball forward. There are many ways we will continue to advocate for just change on immigration but staying on the council was going to get in the way of that." Following the campaign, Kalanick pledged to create a $3m (£2.4m) defence fund to help drivers affected by the president's order. "The executive order is hurting many people in communities all across America," Kalanick wrote. "Families are being separated, people are stranded overseas and there's a growing fear the U.S. is no longer a place that welcomes immigrants. "We will fight for the rights of immigrants in our communities so that each of us can be who we are with optimism and hope for the future," he said.

The data reflect safety-related incidents reported by 11 companies that have been testing more than 100 vehicles on public roads, primarily in the Silicon Valley neighborhoods where the technology has grown up. The reports were made to California’s Department of Motor Vehicles, which posted them online. The documents catalog the number of times from December 2015 through the end of November that humans took over control from a car’s software for safety reasons. Waymo, as Google’s self-driving car project was recently rebranded, did far more testing than the other 10 companies combined _ and had much greater success. Its fleet drove itself more than 635,000 miles with 124 safety-related “disengagements,” which must be reported when the technology fails or the backup driver takes control out of concern the car is malfunctioning. The Google project’s disengagement rate was the equivalent of two incidents every 10,000 miles, a notable decrease over the prior year, when there were eight disengagements per 10,000 miles. “This four-fold improvement reflects the significant work we’ve been doing to make our software and hardware more capable and mature,” Dmitri Dolgov, Waymo’s head of self-driving technology wrote in a blog post . Waymo’s chief critic acknowledged the improvement, but John Simpson of the nonprofit Consumer Watchdog said the number of disengagements shows the cars still “simply aren’t ready to be released to roam our roads” without human backup drivers. Other companies also showed improvements. Nissan reported 28 disengagements over 4,099 miles, or 68 incidents per 10,000 miles _ far better than the 106 in 1,485 miles (713 per 10,000 miles) it reported last year. Cruise Automation, a startup acquired last year by General Motors, reported driving the second most test miles this year. Cruise said its prototypes had 181 disengagements over 9,776 miles (185 per 10,000 miles) and that it was “pleased with our progress” during testing on the complex streets of San Francisco. The company did not file numbers for 2015 because it did not have a testing permit that year. Though imperfect, the data represent the best peek the public gets into the secretive and fiercely competitive world of self-driving cars and how the prototypes are performing. California required the disengagement reports as part of regulations governing testing on public roads. Separately, the state also requires companies to report any collisions involving its cars. When the technology will be ready for the public depends on several factors, including regulators’ readiness and company confidence the vehicles are safe. While Tesla’s Elon Musk has been bullish, talking about months rather than years, companies such as Waymo have suggested 2017 or 2018 is more realistic. Tesla’s disengagement report said four prototypes drove a total of 550 miles last fall, experiencing 182 disengagements _ the equivalent of 3,309 disengagements every 10,000 miles. Tesla logged the miles primarily to develop a publicly posted video , set to the Rolling Stones song “Paint It Black,” of the driver’s seat perspective in a car where a person does not have to put their hands on the wheel or feet on the pedals. The video promoted how Tesla was shipping cars with advanced sensors that will be activated in the future. Generally, Tesla tests on private land, not public roads. Those disengagements are not reported to the state. Meanwhile, Tesla is gathering tens of millions of miles of real-world data when owners engage the current Autopilot feature, which can control steering and speed but is not sophisticated enough to make the cars self-driving from the regulatory perspective. California’s Department of Motor Vehicles has been working for several years on regulations that will govern how the technology can be rolled out to the public when companies believe testing shows it is ready. The state expects to release final “public operation” regulations within six weeks, according to Melissa Figueroa, a spokeswoman for California’s State Transportation Agency. The Department of Motor Vehicles, which is part of the agency, made public a first draft in December 2015, nearly a year after final rules were supposed to be in place. The department has since revised the language based on developments at the federal level and input from industry and other groups. The agency and the department declined comment on the reports released Wednesday AFP Tags: autopilot, BMW, California, Dmitri Dolgov, Elon Musk, Google, Nissan, self-driving, Tesla, Waymo Also read Self-driving cars to Note 7: Among many things, technology has taught me to trust it and accept its flaws Uber to add self-driving Mercedes-Benz to its fleet as it signs deal with Daimler X SELF-DRIVING Reviews Google showcases new self-driving Chrysler Pacifica LeSEE Pro, LeEco’s self-driving car reached a little too late to the event to be demonstrated Audi, BMW and Daimler launch 5G telecom association with technology firms Ford works its way through the self-driving car industry with small and calculated moves Subscribe to our newsletter GO You are Now Subscribed to our Newsletter - Stay Tuned !

The annual income from “the 10% vig,” oops, tax — estimated to be close to $1 trillion by the end of President Barack Obama’s second term — would nearly wipe out the current budget deficit. State and local casino and lottery operations would not affected by the new national legislation. Code named “You Bet Your Ass,” the concept was conceived in a late night drinking and strategy session in May when it seemed obvious to the president’s senior advisors that a second dip of the economy was all but inevitable. As the fifth fifth of Talisker scotch — the current beverage of choice in Washington — was passed around the table, the always mild-mannered chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, slurred the battle cry of the forthcoming campaign: “I’ll give you 10:1 odds that we kick the shit out of those MF’s in 2012.” At that moment, Moshe Peddler, the senior partner of Peddler and Marconi Communications and the president’s outside media maven, felt he had been hit by a thunderbolt. Nevertheless, it took him all night to put the pieces together: that “10:1 odds” phrase, combined with a lifetime of peddling crap, meant federal control and the “taxing” of online gambling. A quick Google search revealed that it was already legal in some major European countries. Internet gambling was coming. The only question was who would control it: the casino operators or Uncle Sam? Today, the Democrats had control of Congress and maybe they could ram it through. After the elections, who knew? Using $200,000 of his company’s political slush funds, Peddler went right to work: grassroots call-ins the next morning to 2,500 radio stations, followed up by in-depth research. That evening, 3,547 land line and cell phone surveys were conducted on two key issues: First, 73% wanted internet gambling; and, second, the public didn’t give a damn who controlled it, as long as they got to play an honest game of Texas Hold? Em. The next morning, Moshe, Rahm and the President sat down for a super secret meeting. Everyone else was banished. Even the secret recording system was shut down. In five minutes, Moshe presented his plan, his research, the preliminary numbers from the budget office and his findings. The chief of staff was so happy he danced on nine fingers. Maybe he would stay the full term after all. The president was another story. Obviously, he’d piss off the religious right and the casino owners. But they were leaning GOP anyway. If Peddler’s numbers were right, he’d come close to wiping out the budget deficit. He figured that plus health care might make him the fifth face on Mt. Rushmore. Peddler read his boss’ face. He was the best closer on the planet, and went in for the kill like Tyson in his prime. “Mr. President, did you know that England and France have already legalized Internet gambling? Denmark has finished its legislation and Germany, Switzerland and Spain are goose-stepping to be next in line. We either try to regulate and tax it, or people are going to go to the offshore operators, where you don’t get any revenue.” The president was sold. “Rahm,” said the now beaming Obama, “alert all the cable and networks for a major address for Sunday at nine. And make sure those budget numbers are right. “Finally, we need a slogan. Something like: Game On.” Bill Regardie was the founder and publisher of Regardie’s Magazine.

Mohammad Shakir, 34, is accused of having sex with the girl between September 30 and October 1, 2016, following their wedding. The ceremony was conducted by ex-imam Ibrahim Omerdic, who also faces charges relating to the illegal marriage. The girl is in a "fragile state" and has "ongoing health issues", prosecutor Ranjani Padmanabhan told Melbourne Magistrates Court on Friday. Shakir appeared at court via video link and was told via an interpreter that the child's mother, stepfather, police and a Department of Health and Human Services representative would give evidence at his committal hearing. Omerdic, 61, imam of the Bosnian Islamic Society and Noble Park Mosque, was stood down after his November arrest and later sacked. In January, the Board of Imams Victoria issued a statement against forced and child marriages, saying they are illegal and all Muslims are required to respect Australian law. Omerdic is on bail while Shakir remains in custody.

Rob Carter, FedEx’s chief information officer, says the shipping giant is considering small vehicles that could drive around neighborhoods and make deliveries without human drivers. Carter is responsible for setting the technology agenda across FedEx’s various operating companies, including its planes-and-trucks Express shipping service and office-and-home Ground delivery service, which operate in 220 countries. He recently told MIT Technology Review about some of FedEx’s emerging technology initiatives in artificial intelligence and robotics. The investments FedEx makes in these technologies could shape the multi-trillion-dollar logistics market, affecting everything from the way people send and receive parcels to the global movement of large fleets of vehicles. For example, someday you might be able to initiate a FedEx shipment by talking to your Amazon Echo or Google Home virtual assistant device. Carter says that FedEx has created an AI-enabled Alexa app that would eventually understand commands like “Alexa, prepare a shipment.” “You [will be able to] just talk your way through and [Alexa will] ask the right questions to make sure you’ve completed the work and then you can expect a truck to roll up to the front door of your office, pick up the shipments, and move them along,” he explains. By eliminating the tedium of filling out forms and searching through menus, the app could streamline the shipping process and boost customer satisfaction. It is still in an early development stage. FedEx is also researching ways it could further automate the way it transports packages. Carter says the company is working with the startup Peloton Technology, whose semi-autonomous technology electronically links trucks into small caravan groups called platoons. The system, which uses wireless vehicle-to-vehicle communication to enable the driver of a lead truck to control the gas and brakes of a truck following closely behind him, is designed to reduce wind resistance and save fuel. The technology is considered a significant step toward fully autonomous trucks, and Peloton has said it will release it in late 2017. Carter says FedEx is also “very much interested in” completely autonomous trucking and has partnered with several automakers that specialize in that technology, including Daimler and its Freightliner truck division and Volvo. Daimler has piloted semi-autonomous trucks on highways in Nevada and Germany while Volvo recently demonstrated a fully autonomous construction truck in an underground Swedish mine. Carter says he expects to see “significant implementations” of automated vehicles in the shipping industry within 10 years, but declined to specify when FedEx might adopt semi- or fully autonomous trucks. FedEx is considering automating package delivery to some extent, but not via conventional drones, or at least not anytime soon. Carter describes himself as “an avid drone hobbyist,” but says delivery-oriented models  have “pretty limited capacity” since most can’t lift objects heavier than five pounds or fly farther than 50 miles. He also cites as barriers the challenge of winning approval to operate drones in densely populated areas and ensuring that the devices don’t injure children or pets that approach them. Carter thinks fixed-wing drones that travel set distances, from specific departure and receiving points, could be feasible for commercial deliveries, but overall he favors rolling robots to flying ones. He notes that rolling a vehicle to a destination is generally far more energy-efficient than levitating one. And since people are already accustomed to postal workers coming to their homes and businesses and placing mail in pre-defined receptacles, future FedEx courier robots could drop off parcels in a similar way. Investing in future technologies, no matter how promising, isn’t likely to fend off critiques that FedEx is lagging upstarts like Amazon and Uber, which separately launched drone-powered deliveries and self-driving tractor trailers in recent months. UPS, FedEx’s main competitor, has also been publicly testing drone-powered parcel delivery since September 2016. Technavio analyst Bharath Kanniappan thinks that FedEx is falling behind its competitors in terms of implementing robots into its delivery system. However, he says, the company’s delay likely stems from a desire to ensure it can continue to deliver packages “with utmost care,” which he notes is the company’s “unique selling proposition,” given its reputation as an express shipper. Satish Jindel, who heads the transport and logistics consultancy SJ Consulting Group, thinks that FedEx is making the right bets for a closely scrutinized public company. “They are focused and deploying technology in areas where they see a payoff from a cost point of view,” says Jindel, pointing out that FedEx’s shareholders expect the company to generate profits, whereas Amazon’s shareholders accept the company’s expensive risks.

The move could put pressure on other CEOs expected to attend a meeting with Trump on Friday. (Reporting By Heather Somerville, writing Peter Henderson; Editing by David Gregorio) Wochit Business How does Snapchat make money? Feb.02 -- Snapchat parent company Snap just unveiled its IPO prospectus, setting the stage for one of the largest tech debut in years. Much of how Snap operates has been shrouded in secrecy since co-founders Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy first launched the Snapchat app in 2011. What is clear is that the app is most popular with young people, which means the investor community isn’t necessarily using the app -- and has often been confused about what it does and how it makes money. Bloomberg IPO reporter Alex Barinka and Bloomberg Technology reporter Sarah Frier give a tutorial on the app and show how Snap has pivoted into other offerings, like its Spectacles glasses.

But today its control seems here to stay—as does big cable’s control over how you consume the programming you pay for. Quotes in the article Comcast Corp CMCSA ▼ 75.09 -0.52 -0.69% Apple Inc AAPL ▼ 128.53 -0.22 -0.17% Amazon.com Inc AMZN ▲ 839.95 +7.60 +0.91% AT&T Inc T ▼ 41.18 -0.88 -2.09% This week, the Federal Communications Commission met for the first time under its new chairman, Ajit Pai, a Republican. The original agenda for the meeting included consideration of the agency’s latest proposal—advanced under former Democratic chairman Tom Wheeler—to force cable companies to make their services a bit more open. That item disappeared from the agenda—and with it the likelihood that much of anything will change in the world of cable, at least as far as government regulation is concerned. Related: Trump’s FCC Pick Doesn’t Bode Well For Net Neutrality At the dawn of the Obama administration, the future of cable looked a lot different, and not because government regulators were going to force the industry to change. Comcast announced a tech standard called Tru2Way at the 2008 Consumer Electronics Show that would have made it possible for any company to build a cable box that tapped into Comcast’s television service. The idea was that instead of renting a cable box from Comcast, you could pick from a wide range of different devices. You’d still need to pay for your cable subscription, but you could use your Apple TV or Roku instead of renting a cable box, or maybe just plug your TV right into the wall without worrying about any box at all. “The age of the closed, proprietary cable box is behind us,” Comcast CEO Brian Roberts said at the event. Had the idea ever taken off, cable box rental fees would have disappeared, and third parties could have competed to create the best cable-viewing experience. Don’t like your pay TV provider’s labyrinth of menus? Maybe the Apple TV’s interface would be more to your liking. Or perhaps you would have been able to use gadgets like the Amazon Echo or Google Home. But Tru2Way never went anywhere. Neither did the bigger idea of opening up cable until last year, when the FCC proposed rules that would have required pay TV companies to open their video streams to third parties through an open standard. The proposal was not unlike what Comcast pledged to do back in 2008. It was also a long time coming: Congress first asked the FCC to promote competition in the cable equipment business back in 1996, and would have replaced the outdated and cumbersome CableCard standard. The cable industry pushed back, arguing that the proposed system was technically unfeasible and would have enabled people to pirate content more easily, as well as allow those third parties companies to insert their own ads into shows. The FCC listened and came back with a watered-down proposal that would have required companies to simply provide apps for all major platforms—think Amazon Video on your Comcast box—and make their content searchable. The industry balked at this idea as well. Now it looks like the whole endeavor has been postponed, more than two decades after congress first asked FCC to look into the issue. More: AT&T Undercuts Cable TV With $35 Internet Streaming Service Still, the question remains: Why didn’t the industry make these changes voluntarily? After all, the ability to watch what you want where you want on any device you want is the basic promise of internet-powered television in the 21st century.© Comcast Comcast Keeping the Cord The most obvious answer is money. According to the FCC, consumers collectively spend around $19.5 billion a year on cable box rental fees. That’s almost pure profit for the industry because customers pay for the cost of the box several times over. But Comcast was apparently happy to part with that revenue a few years ago when it proposed Tru2Way. So what’s changed? Why has Comcast gone from promising to kill the proprietary cable box to prolonging its existence? The rise of video streaming services is likely key. “If [cable companies] relegate their user experience to just another app on a third-party box like a Roku, they’re on par with all the other forms of entertainment that compete for user attention,” says telecommunications industry analyst Jan Dawson. Without an open standard, third parties have to work out deals with companies like Charter and Comcast in order to carry their apps. That gives the cable giants quite a bit of control over what you can watch and where. If Comcast doesn’t want to make an app for the Apple TV, then you’re out of luck. It’s not all bad news for those who want to watch TV somewhere other than their TV sets. Streaming services like Dish’s Sling TV and AT&T’s DirecTV let you watch live programming over the internet on smartphones, tablets, and computers. And this week Comcast launched a beta version of an app that lets you watch live TV on Roku devices. Charter/Time-Warner Cable have a Roku app as well. But Charter’s Roku app doesn’t include on-demand programming or the ability to record any content. And Comcast’s beta app still requires a cable box, at least until the final version is released. In the meantime, Comcast is also working on improving the cable box itself to avoid becoming just another app. The company launched its voice-controlled remote in 2015, and last year Bloomberg reported that Comcast was working on a more Alexa-like version that doesn’t require you to carry around the remote like a microphone. Comcast is also in the process of integrated its system with a range of smart home devices, including lights, smart locks, the Nest thermostat, and its own home security service. In other words, Comcast is trying to build a smart home platform with TV at the center. A platform that, as it happens, will also encourage bundling of multiple Comcast services. That aspiration puts it in competition with Amazon, Apple, Google, and many other companies battling to control the living room via voice-activated hardware. Control over TV is Comcast’s edge in this battle. If its box is the only way you can search and control your cable with your voice and you can control everything else in your home with it too, you have less incentive to use a competing product. And thanks to the FCC’s apparently new direction, Comcast’s cable box is likely to remain the only cable box its customers in Comcast markets will be able to use for the foreseeable future. The risk for Comcast is that customers might opt to cut the cord entirely and just watch streaming video, especially if competing services are cheaper and provide a better experience. But Comcast has another edge: data limits. If the cost of streaming services plus data overages ends up being more than a cable subscription, Comcast could encourage people to stick to cable. The FCC’s net neutrality rules give the agency the ability to step in if it deems Comcast’s actions as anti-competitive. But those rules are in Republicans’ crosshairs. Under the new administration, Comcast’s control appears assured. You, on the other hand, are stuck with the same remote.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Friday, 3 February 2017 | MYT 10:05 AM Microsoft asks for exception programme on Trump orders Speaking out: Microsoft is the first major US company to press the government to create a formal programme that would ease the ban for foreign-born workers who do not have permanent residence in the US. — Reuters Microsoft Corp on Thursday said it proposed a programme to US President Donald Trump's administration allowing people from seven predominantly Muslim nations to enter and leave the United States on business or family emergency travel if they hold valid work or student visas and have not committed any crimes. In a letter to Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Microsoft President Brad Smith outlined a program for case-by-case review of exceptions to a travel ban instituted last week. Microsoft is the first major US company to press the government to create a formal programme that would ease the ban for foreign-born workers who do not have permanent residence in the United States. Permanent residents, known as green card holders, were granted an exemption on Sunday. The proposal argued that Kelly and Tillerson have the power to grant exceptions to the travel ban under the order issued last week by Trump. Technology companies including Microsoft, Google owner Alphabet Inc, Apple Inc and Amazon.com Inc have been vocal in their opposition to Trump’s order, arguing that they rely on workers from around the world to create their products and services. Amazon and Expedia Inc filed declarations of support on Monday in a legal challenge to the order by the Washington state Attorney General. Microsoft said on Thursday that 76 of its employees and 41 dependents were affected by the travel ban. Microsoft’s proposal would cover holders of the H-1B visa, a temporary work visa that the tech sector relies on to recruit foreign talent. Kelly issued an order on Sunday saying that green card holders would be allowed to travel under the executive orders, but H-1B holders from the seven affected countries are still banned. The proposal would also allow students to travel from affected countries if they can prove they were enrolled and in good standing at a US school. The letter proposed that both students and employees would not be allowed to travel to the banned countries for business reasons but could travel there for family reasons with case-by-case approval. "In short, these individuals are 'known quantities' in their communities: their character, personalities, conduct, and behaviour is understood by their colleagues, employers, friends, and neighbours," Microsoft's Smith said in a blog post made at the same time the company sent its letter. Microsoft is also among several technology companies considering signing an open letter to Trump expressing concern about his ban on Syrian refugees, along with other issues such as the estimated 750,000 people brought to the United States as children whose immigration status is unclear. The letter is being circulated among tech companies and companies outside the sector, according to two sources in the industry familiar with the matter. Facebook Inc, Apple, Google and Microsoft, along with a number of companies outside the sector, are considering signing, the sources said. Recode and Bloomberg previously reported the letter's existence. Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Apple and Facebook could not immediately be reached for comment.   —  Reuters You May Be Interested Here’s Apple’s challenge in India Under attack from hackers, UK isn’t hiring staff fast enough ‘The Elder Scrolls Online’ welcomes return of Morrowind Apple to expand iconic NYC ‘Cube’ store in lift for Fifth Avenue Uber CEO quits Trump’s business advisory group Scotiabank to invest US$1bil in digital technology Others Also Read Choose your favourite yee sang U.S. defence chief, in Japan, reaffirms commitment to defence treaty Australia take command over Czechs advertisement Latest News Apple to build iPhone in India this year: official Amazon projects spending that concerns investors watching profit Snap signed five-year, US$2bil deal to use Google’s Cloud Nintendo plays with fire as new mobile game takes ‘gacha’ global Under attack from hackers, UK isn’t hiring staff fast enough Most Viewed in Tech Apple to build iPhone in India this year: official Is it time to say ‘goodbye’ to Google Allo?

The result: our data is increasingly being taken hostage by ransomware creators. Santa Clara, Calif.-based Malwarebytes’ new “State of Malware Report 2017” brings that and more bad news about security to light. But a chat with one of the people behind the study offered a few reasons to be optimistic, as well. Specifically, that a lot of today’s software, if properly updated, can help protect itself. Ransomware rising Ransomware, or apps that encrypt your data and then demand you pay a ransom (usually in Bitcoin) for a decryption key, have become a big business. In fact, the malware has afflicted everything from hospital computer systems to the occasional “smart” TV to the more than 100 surveillance cameras in Washington hacked days before President Trump’s inauguration.   Malwarebytes’ report which is largely based on data from the company’s Windows and Android anti-malware apps, helps provide some context as to how bad the ransomware problem has become. According to the report, in January 2016, ransomware constituted 18% of all malware delivered by email or through exploits of existing software. By November 2016, it had climbed to 66%, which the report labels “an unprecedented domination of the threat landscape.” The U.S. is the top target, while Russia, the home of many ransomware developers, is one of the least popular targets. View photos Ransomware will hold your computer hostage unless you pay up.More In a phone interview, Malwarebytes director of malware intelligence Adam Kujawa noted the pickiness exhibited by the two major families of ransomware, Cerber and Locky: “Both avoid any systems that appear to be coming from Russia or the surrounding countries.” Old cons come back But that’s not the depressing part of this report if you’ve been following the virus business for a while. That comes when you learn that Malwarebytes still sees a lot of malware getting on computers via in email attachments, many of which are Microsoft (MSFT) Office attachments with embedded macros whose code will attack your computer. Those techniques date back to the days of dial-up internet, when Office was much more lenient about running macros in random documents and defending against them was harder. And yet here they are again. As Kujawa put it: “Where are we, 2005?” Today’s malware spam often comes personalized for particular users and tries to fool them into thinking that clicking a button in a Word document or Excel spreadsheet will unlock it for viewing, when in reality it will start a download of malicious code that can then take over their computers. (You can read a detailed breakdown of one such attack in this December post from Sophos researcher Paul Ducklin.) Other opponents The Malwarebytes report also calls out a few other growing hazards online. One “ad fraud” malware, which can generate a decent amount of income for cybercriminals, proved nearly as popular as ransomware. Ad fraud malware commanders a victim’s computer to visit sites and click on ads placed by the authors of the malware attack or their business partners. The report further nods to the rise in “botnet” software taking over computers — including “Internet of Things” devices like connected security cameras — and using them as part of distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. Unlike ransomware, however, the U.S. isn’t seeing the worst of this form of malware. According to Malwarebytes, 61.2% of all botnets are found in Asia, while about 15% are found in Europe. View photos Even your connected refrigerator can be turned against you.More Read More Interestingly, the U.S. was the leading venue for Android malware, with 12.74% of all detections happening here. But if you stick to Google’s (GOOG) Play Store for downloading apps — the default in the U.S. — your odds of being the victim of an attack are exceedingly low. Kujawa noted that Google does a good job of quickly yanking the occasional malware app that sneaks into its app market. He further added that Apple’s (AAPL) iOS, which can’t connect to alternative app sources, is even safer. Not all software is created equal While Malwarebytes’ report leaves it to the reader to figure out how to avoid being a victim of malware, Kujawa pointed out that many of these attacks can be thwarted by using current software. “A lot of these exploit kits, the vulnerabilities they target, they’ve been patched for a long time,” he said. For example, he noted one common way criminals attack people’s computers is through an Adobe (ADBE) Flash flaw from 2012 — but his advice for that fast-fading media plug-in remains to “disable it entirely.” (Follow Adobe’s instructions to uninstall Flash.) The operating system you run matters, too. You may feel comfortable with Windows 7, but Kujawa called Windows 10 “a more secure operating system at the base level,” and other security researchers have come to the same conclusion. The Mac remains relatively more secure, even after incidents like last year’s brief ransomware outbreak. Said Kujawa: “Every year, we say… this is the year when Mac malware is going to be huge, and it has yet to come to fruition.” But more secure software doesn’t mean that malware authors will give up and get real jobs.

As recently as Wednesday, the president's daughter's brand was still listed on the Nordstrom site, but by Thursday, it was missing from the master list and from a page that had previously featured her branded women's shoes, clothing, and handbags, Business Insider reported. A Google shopping link does point to Ivanka Trump-branded items, but just four items, three pairs of shoes and a dress, remain on the link. All were on sale for 40 percent off Thursday. A movement began in October to boycott companies doing business with Trump's family, after a leaked tape of the eventual president making lewd comments about women was published, Business Insider reported, but it is not clear if the boycott led to the changes on the Nordstrom website. Shannon Coulter, the marketing strategist launching the boycott, has traced the brand's inventory on the website, and noted the available items have been dropping. She commented, in the first week of December, there were still 71 items from Trump's fashion brand on the site, but last week site, there were only 26, and by Wednesday, there were just nine products left.

By CaitlinHuston Reporter At long last, the veil on Snapchat has been lifted. Snap Inc. SNAP, +0.00%  , the parent company of messaging app Snapchat, officially filed to go public Thursday. Snap, which calls itself a “camera company,” did not disclose the terms of its IPO, but did say that the stockholders who buy into the offering will not have any voting rights. One key question about the IPO is whether the company will surpass its private market valuation of $17.8 billion. Investors expect this offering to value the company between $20 billion and $25 billion, according to The Wall Street Journal. Snap reported that its ephemeral messaging service had 158 million daily active users at the end of 2016, and an average of 2.5 billion “snaps” are created on Snapchat every day. See also: Can IPO market Snap out of its doldrums in 2017? Snap plans to list on the New York Stock Exchange under the proposed symbol “SNAP.” Snapchat, an app in which users send and view “snaps,” makes money from ads on the platform and content created by third-party channels such as news organizations. It also recently introduced a hardware product, Snapchat Specs, and has a payment feature called Snapcash. Here are six things to know about the company before it goes public: The financials Snap reported growing revenues and increasing losses. Snap recorded $404.5 million in revenue in 2016, compared with $58.7 million in 2015. Net losses grew to $514.6 million in 2016, compared with a net loss of $372.9 million in 2015. Like many burgeoning tech startups, Snap warned that it “may never achieve or maintain profitability.” Snap recorded a loss from operations of $520.4 million in 2016 and a loss of $381.7 million in 2015. Its global average revenue per user for the three months ended in December 2016 was $1.06, up from 31 cents in the year-earlier period. The majority of Snap’s revenue in 2016, 98%, came from advertising. Read also: Seven highly valued tech startups that could IPO in 2017 A young, active user base Snap had 158 million daily active users, which it says is a “critical measure” of user engagement, as of Dec. 31, 2016. Growth in daily active users has been pressured of late, though, growing by only 7% between the second and third quarters of 2016 and relatively flat growth in the final quarter. Snap mentioned competition in their prospectus, and that decline roughly coincides with Facebook Inc.’s FB, -1.79%  early August launch of Instagram Stories, a product similar to one of SnapChat’s most popular features. Snapchat explains why growth is slowing. They could have just said, "Instagram Stories." pic.twitter.com/ihHBDbI7v3— Ben Sandofsky (@sandofsky) February 2, 2017 User growth is important for attracting advertisers and, consequently, the majority of Snap’s revenue. The majority of Snapchat users are 18-to-34 years old, a coveted advertising demographic that the company has reportedly been luring away from sites like Facebook. Users younger than 25 are among the most active on Snapchat, visiting the app more than 20 times a day and spending more than 30 minutes a day, as of the quarter ended December 2016, Snap said. On average, daily active users visited Snapchat more than 18 times each day and spend 25 to 30 minutes there. Still, Snap noted that the teen demographic is not “brand loyal” and could shift attention to another platform. Already the numbers show a seasonality, with engagement lower in summer months, according to the prospectus. Also, Snap may struggle to grow its user numbers in countries or areas without the high-bandwidth-capacity cellular networks the app requires, it said. VERTICAL - Snapchat Basics Explained in Snapchat (2:28) Snapchat may be popular with millennials but there are many reasons it should appeal to everyone. WSJ's Joanna Stern shows you how it works. Photo/video: Drew Evans/The Wall Street Journal. Retaining control The company has three classes of common stock and plans to offer common A stock that will not give stockholders any voting power. Owners of class B common stock will be entitled to one vote per share and holders of class C common stock, which include co-founders Evan Spiegel, 26, and Robert Murphy, 28, are entitled to 10 votes per share. With that ownership, both parties have “the ability to control the outcome of all matters” that are sent to the stockholders for approval. The filing does not yet disclose what percentage voting power they will have after the offering. See also: The IPO market is in the dumps, and all the tax cuts in the world won’t help Spiegel, the company’s chief executive, had a salary of $503,205 in 2016, with a $1 million bonus and other compensation totaling $2.4 million. Under his offer letter, he will reduce his salary to $1 as of the effective date of the registration statement, with a cash bonus of $1 million. He will also receive restricted stock units, representing 3% of outstanding capital stock, in quarterly installments for three years, beginning in the third quarter after the offering. If either are fired, they will still have “significant” voting power. If either die, shares will convert and the other co-founder will be able to exercise voting control over outstanding stock. Rivalries and a dependence on big companies Snap uses Alphabet Inc’s GOOGL, +0.37% GOOG, +0.36%  Google Cloud for much of its computing, storage, bandwidth and other needs. To that end, on Jan. 30, 2017, just three days before the filing, Snap committed to spend $2 billion with Google Cloud over the next five years. If that relationship were disrupted, Snap said its business would be “seriously harmed.” Snap sees its hosting costs with Google or others growing as its user base and engagement grows. In terms of competition, Snap lists Apple Inc. AAPL, -0.17% Alphabet’s Google and Twitter Inc. TWTR, +3.13%  Facebook may be a more direct threat, as Snap noted the new feature on Instagram that “largely mimics” its Snap Stories. These companies have greater resources and may have the ability to draw users away from Snap, the company admitted. “We face significant competition in almost every aspect of our business both domestically and internationally,” the prospectus said. Snapchat Spectacles Review: The Dos and Don’ts (2:40) The much-hyped Snapchat video-camera glasses record 10-second clips with the tap of a button. WSJ's Joanna Stern has some rules for people who plan to wear camcorders on their faces. Photo/video: Drew Evans/The Wall Street Journal. Many buildings, but no headquarters Snap has been known for keeping things under wraps, even within the company. To that end, the prospectus says the company has offices spread out across the U.S. and abroad, including several principal offices in Venice, Calif. But those principal offices are still “dispersed throughout the city,” which Snap notes could hurt employee morale, retention and the company’s ability to oversee employees. The company had 1,859 employees at the end of 2016, up from 600 in 2015. Still, the prospectus says the company has a tightknit and “kind” team. “When we say ’kind,’ we mean the type of kindness that compels you to let someone know that they have something stuck in their teeth even though it’s a little awkward,” the prospectus says.

Its key advantage was that the “snaps” disappeared after they were sent, so users felt “comfortable sending photos of themselves even when they don’t look pretty or perfect.” But the platform quickly developed a reputation for “sexting,” or sending racy selfies and videos. “When we were just getting started, many people didn’t understand what Snapchat was and said it was just for sexting, even when we knew it was being used for so much more,” the prospectus says. Moving on from selfies, Snap added videos and then the ability to send a photo or video to all of the user’s friends, thus launching “My Stories.” They added publisher stories in January 2015, opening up the feature to organizations with editorial teams. Since those days, Snap has added more features, including lenses that superimpose over the user’s face and geofilters, allowing an overlay for the user’s location and for brand advertising.

Sister Khloe is furious with Scott Disick for publicly making out with two girls in Miami, and is begging him to keep certain things private for the ‘kids’ sake.’ We’ve got the EXCLUSIVE! Look, if Scott Disick, 33, wants to get down and dirty with sexy ladies in Miami, he’s allowed to do that. He’s a grown man and this is a free country — but Kourtney Kardashian, 37, doesn’t need to see those PDA pictures plastered all over the internet. “Khloe [Kardashian] thinks Scott should keep his make out sessions private,” a source tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. “The kids are getting older and for their sake, he should be more careful about what he does in public. Khloe hates to see Kourt go through this again — seeing Scott’s flings go viral.” Mason, who’s already 7, is probably using the internet like a pro. Lord knows it doesn’t take a ton of Google-ing to find a story about Scott, especially now that he’s been photographed kissing TWO women in a matter of days. It’s bad enough that Kourt has to deal with his unwavering behavior all alone. While he’s off vacationing in Florida or Utah for the Sundance film festival, she’s being a stay-at-home mom to Mason, Reign, and Penelope. Khloe, 32, thinks Scott’s sex-capades are “embarrassing,” the source continues, “plus, she has to deal with everyone calling her to make sure she’s ok, especially her mom.” Scott Disick Gets Cozy With Mystery Girl In Miami — Pics Unfortunately, it doesn’t sound like the Keeping Up With The Kardashians reality star is doing that well. “His partying freaks her out,” a source tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. “First he goes MIA in Dubai, then he’s going wild in Sundance and now he’s partying like a 21-year old in Miami.” Scott’s behavior is even breaking OUR hearts, especially because it looked like he was totally back together with Kourt.

Baker Reuters3 February 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Share A billboard displays the logo of Snapchat above Times Square in New York March 12, 2015. REUTERS/Lucas Jackson/File PhotoMore By Lauren Hirsch and Liana B. Baker (Reuters) - Snapchat owner Snap Inc shot the opening salvo in its $3 billion initial public offering on Thursday, outlining aggressive expansion plans but offering new investors no say on how the company is run and no promise of profits. Snap's publication on Thursday of its IPO registration document sets the stage for its upcoming marketing campaign to convince investors to look past its widening losses and the firm grip of its founders, and focus on its rapid growth of active users. The number of Snap's daily active users grew to an average of 158 million at the end of December, up 48 percent year-on-year, Snap revealed. However, its net loss widened to $514.6 million in 2016 from $372.9 million the year before. While Snap will have time to polish its marketing pitch in the run-up to the IPO planned for March, some analysts were taken aback that the company was just beginning to reap cash from its product. "What surprises me the most is that it is still very early days when it comes to Snap making money," said Rohit Kulkarni, managing director at private securities investment firm SharesPost. Snap had confidentially registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for an IPO late last year. It kept the filing under such tight wraps, even some of its IPO underwriters had not seen it prior to publication on Thursday, sources familiar with the matter previously told Reuters. Snap said in the IPO registration document published on Thursday it would become the first U.S. company to go public with shares on offer not granting voting rights to stock market investors. Its founders, Evan Spiegel and Robert Murphy, will keep control of the company. Snap could be valued at between $20 billion to $25 billion, according to sources familiar with the situation who asked not to be named because the matter is confidential. That would give the company the richest valuation in a U.S. technology IPO since Facebook Inc. Snap, which launched itself in 2012 with an app that sends disappearing messages, rebranded itself last year as a camera company and started selling $130 video camera glasses. It generates the majority of its revenue from advertising, seeking to challenge the dominance of internet giants such as Facebook and Alphabet Inc's Google. "The industry has been crying out for new advertising units" says Ian Schafer, founder and chairman of ad agency Deep Focus, referring to the tight hold Facebook and Google have on the digital advertising marketplace. In its IPO registration document, Snap cited Apple Inc, Google, Twitter Inc, Facebook and its photo-sharing platform Instagram as its competitors. TIGHT CONTROL Spiegel, the 26-year-old Snap co-founder, last year earned $503,205 in salary, with a $1 million bonus. Imran Khan, Snapchat's chief strategy officer whom it hired from investment bank Credit Suisse Group AG in 2014, earned $241,539 last year with a $5.2 million bonus. In 2015, Khan also received $145.3 million worth of Snap shares as a sign-up bonus. Spiegel and Murphy will maintain tight control over Snap's stock through a unique three-share class structure. The structure will give Spiegel and Murphy the right of 10 votes for every share. Existing investors will have one vote for each of their shares, while new investors will have no voting rights. Snap said it couldn't predict if the structure would "result in a lower trading price or greater fluctuations" in the stock. Keeping tight control is common in companies closely associated with their founders, who often prefer to grow their business without being questioned by a broad array of investors. Still, offering a class of stock with no votes in an IPO is unprecedented. Though the structure has drawn some criticism for not giving stock market investors the opportunity to have input, some people close to the company have argued that investors can "vote with their feet" by not buying into the IPO if they are not comfortable with the arrangements. "Investors have to decide, am I going to avail myself of the opportunity to buy the stock, and forget about the fact that somewhere down the road they are likely going to run into trouble?" said James McRitchie, an independent corporate governance activist who has pressed for more equal voting rights at companies including Facebook. Read More PAYING GOOGLE Snap had $404.5 million in sales in 2016, up from $58.7 million in 2015. However, it had adjusted losses before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization last year of $459 million, compared with $292.9 million in 2015. Snap's biggest losses stem from "hosting fees" which it pays to cloud computing companies such as Google to use their infrastructure for its data. It will pay Google $2 billion over the next five years to use its cloud computing services. Because Snapchat users rely heavily on data-heavy pictures and video, the cost of these service is high. Still, the proportion of the company's costs to its revenue has been declining. Its strategy has been to bargain for better hosting rates as its growing number of users buoys its negotiating leverage. "They are adding infrastructure ahead of growth, and that is why you have some front-loading of losses," said SharesPost's Kulkarni. Some companies such as Facebook have their own hosting platforms, though this model can be more costly. Facebook's Instagram, which recently introduced disappearing video content similar to Snapchat, had 600 million users as of late last year. Like Snapchat, Instagram sells advertising on its platform. Snap's aggressive expansion is reflected in its staff numbers. By the end of last year, it had increased its number of employees to 1,859 from 600 in 2015. Snap said it would use the proceeds from its IPO for general purposes, including working capital, operating expenses and capital expenditures. Snap said it will list on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker SNAP. Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs Group Inc, JPMorgan Chase & Co and Deutsche Bank AG are leading the offering as underwriters.

As the world’s largest firm by market valuation, it has not disappointed the public in terms of its sales volume. After three consecutive quarters of overall year-on-year decline, Apple’s overall revenues rebounded during the last big holiday season, and shares rose more than 3 per cent, now only about 6 per cent off the record high of February 2015, when the firm was valued at $775 billion. Despite its stellar performance, however, Apple still has no shortage of critics, whose ranks have seemed only to grow since Tim Cook has taken the reins. This may also explain why Apple is glaringly undervalued compared to other tech giants. Apple’s ratio of price to earnings per share (P/E), which shows what the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its current earnings, sits at around 15. By the same measure, Microsoft and Google are hovering at about 30, Facebook at 50, and Amazon, the most extreme outlier of all, is close to 200. To put it differently, investors are willing to bet thirteen times more on Amazon than on Apple for every dollar earned by either company. How could that be possible? ● The Apple Core: More than fifteen years ago, when Apple first introduced the iPod in October 2001, the project was set to meet an impossibly short deadline imposed from the top down by Steve Jobs. To do so, Jon Rubinstein, then head of hardware, had to swiftly assemble an engineering team that focused on integrating standardised third-party components into a small package. Importantly, the prime differentiation of the iPod was not its physical design but its complementary offering, iTunes. Jobs reportedly insisted that the iTunes user interface be modelled on Palm’s HotSync software so that the iPod could transfer songs seamlessly from iTunes. Apple’s commanding lead is therefore rooted in the flawless integration of hardware and software wrapped in an elegant industrial design. In 2007, while iPod sales were still going through the roof, Jobs launched the iPhone, which combined an iPod, a cell phone, and Internet access into a single device. Although iPhone’s exclusive touch-screen at the time attracted much attention from the general public, what sustained iPhone’s differentiation against other competitors was the App Store. By providing software development kits to independent software developers at a low cost, Apple became the leading platform architect of the smartphone industry. Through its App Store and mobile devices, the company fostered the development of what has become the largest mobile app marketplace. These two core capabilities, the integration of hardware, software, and design and the orchestration of a deep network of independent app developers, have sustained the growth of iPhone over the past ten years. According to BMO Capital Markets, during the third quarter of 2016, Apple took home 103.6 per cent of the smartphone industry’s profits – arithmetically impossible if not for the fact that competitors actually lost money in the sector. With so much success, what’s there to complain about? ● Why investors are fidgeting: It turns out the stock price of a firm is no more than the net present value of all future cash flow. If managers grow the company’s earnings at the rate the market expects, the firm’s share price grows only at the rate of its cost of capital, as those expectations have already been factored into the current share price. the only way to increase a company’s stock price is to provide constant ‘upside surprises’ by repeatedly delivering growth that the market has not foreseen To persistently create shareholder value at a greater rate, managers must do something that investors have not already taken into account – and they must do so over and over again. In other words, the only way to increase a company’s stock price is to provide constant “upside surprises” by repeatedly delivering growth that the market has not foreseen. For this reason, when Apple reported its earnings last Tuesday, investors looked at its services revenue, not just at iPhone sales. At the deepest level, there has always been the lurking fear that the two core capabilities of Apple are being rapidly replicated by competition. ● The roaring old rivals: Just before Christmas last year, Microsoft revealed the Surface Studio, a 28-inch all-in-one desktop that can flatten out into a digital drafting table. Its immersive computing experience, geared for visual artists, allows designers to lean over the display horizontally as they would over a drafting table. The Surface Dial, a physical puck that one plops on the screen, triggers a menu of functions specific to the app being used. “When we can change the colour while you’re painting without even picking up the [stylus’] tip, that’s not just as good as real life – that’s better,” said one user. This is exactly the sort of integration between physical accessories and operating systems that has made Apple distinctive, except this time the thunder came from its old rival, Microsoft. Meanwhile, Google has launched its Pixel phone. Hardwired into Pixel is Google Assistant, similar to Microsoft’s Cortana, Apple’s Siri, and Amazon’s Alexa. But because Google has acquired considerable knowledge about the world, having spent the past 18 years parsing data for search queries, the conversational assistant appears to be far more intelligent than its contemporaries. When asked, “Play the Shakira song from Zootopia,” Google assistant knows which track to play. The assistant is also capable of offering detailed advice on local businesses and directions with traffic predictions, thanks to Google Maps. Your favourite holiday will even display when you casually say, “Show me my pictures of the beach from last summer.” All these mean the product differentiation between Apple and others is narrowing. To suggest Apple is running into some sort of existential crisis is, of course, absurd. After Steve Jobs departed, CEO Cook has more than doubled the company’s net profit to an astounding $53 billion per year. Yet, as the stock market suggests, most investors believe Google and Microsoft will catch up fast. As artificial intelligence and digital assistants are gathering steam, Apple must learn some new tricks before it’s too late.

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File PhotoMore By Stephen Nellis and Mica Rosenberg SAN FRANCISCO/ WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Among Silicon Valley’s top tech employers, Facebook Inc could be the most vulnerable to U.S. President Donald Trump’s expected crackdown on guest-worker visas, according to a Reuters analysis of U.S. Labor Department filings. More than 15 percent of Facebook's U.S. employees in 2016 used a temporary work visa, giving the social media leader a legal classification as a H-1B “dependent” company. That is a higher proportion than Alphabet Inc's Google, Apple Inc , Amazon.com Inc or Microsoft Corp . (Graphic: http://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/rngs/FACEBOOK-IMMIGRATION/010031Q63Y3/index.html) That could cause problems for Facebook if Trump or Congress decide to make the H-1B program more restrictive, as the president and some Republican lawmakers have threatened to do. Both Trump and Attorney General nominee Senator Jeff Sessions have opposed the program in its current form. They have also indicated that they are open to reforming it to “ensure the beneficiaries of the program are the best and the brightest,” according to a draft executive order seen by Reuters. Reuters could not immediately confirm the authenticity of the draft. The Trump administration has not proposed any new rules that would target companies with the H-1B "dependent" classification. But the fact that Facebook alone among major tech companies falls into that category suggests it is the most exposed in the industry to any changes in H-1B visa policy. Facebook declined to comment on the matter. Trump administration officials could not immediately be reached for comment. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said on Monday that Trump would target H-1B visas as part of a larger immigration reform effort through executive orders and Congressional action, but gave no details. H-1B visas are intended for foreign nationals in "specialty" occupations that generally require higher education, which according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) includes, but is not limited to, scientists, engineers or computer programmers. The government awards 85,000 every year, chiefly through a lottery system. Companies say they use them to recruit top talent. But a majority of the visas are awarded to outsourcing firms, sparking criticism by skeptics that those firms use the visas to fill lower-level information technology jobs. Critics also say the lottery system benefits outsourcing firms that flood the system with mass applications. H-1B dependent status is mostly held by these outsourcing firms such as India's Tata Consultancy Services or Infosys. The status was introduced in the late 1990s in an effort to ensure that companies did not use the visas to replace American workers with cheaper foreign labor. The status requires companies to prove they cannot find U.S. workers for the jobs. Facebook listed itself as a dependent company in its applications for H-1B visas with the Labor Department last year. Before he took office as president, Trump discussed changes to the H-1B visa program with top technology executives, including Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg. Those changes included possibly ending the lottery and replacing it with a system that would award the visas to the highest-paying jobs first, a move designed to reduce their issuance to outsourcing firms. Such a move could soften the blow from any H-1B changes for Facebook and other major technology companies. The average salary offered for Facebook H-1B jobs was $145,550, according to its application filings last year. Tata, a traditional outsourcing firm, offered $67,950 on average, barely above the $60,000 floor set by law for the H-1B program. The draft executive order did not mention specifics about the lottery. It did require the U.S. secretary of labor to provide the president with a report on “the actual or potential injury to U.S. workers caused, directly or indirectly, by work performed by nonimmigrant workers in the H-1B” visa program. “We are hoping that the final draft will have more details,” said Russell Harrison, director of government relations at IEEE-USA, a group that represents U.S. engineers and favors that H-1B reform.

Tags Snapchat Business Business Snapchat parent Snap to raise up to $4.2 billion in IPO Reuters | Friday, Feb 3, 2017 Snapchat, known for its disappearing messages, has become hugely popular with young smartphone users. Photo: Reuters Reuters Friday, Feb 3, 2017 SAN FRANCISCO - The parent of the fast-growing social network Snapchat filed public documents for a share offering Thursday, seeking to raise up to $3 billion ( S$4.2 billion) in a keenly anticipated Wall Street debut. California-based Snap Inc., which had earlier filed confidential documents for an initial public offering, was expected to be one of the biggest tech company IPOs in recent years with a valuation likely to top $20 billion. In documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Snap said it took in $404 million in revenue last year but lost $515 million. Snapchat, known for its disappearing messages, has become hugely popular with young smartphone users. But the company has recently been expanding its offerings to allow publishers to deliver content through the platform. According to the filing, 158 million people use Snapchat daily, and over 2.5 billion Snaps are created every day. Snapchat has partnerships with dozens of publishers and organisations, including one announced Thursday by the New York Times. Snapchat said it expects to derive most of its revenue from advertising, where it will compete against rivals such as Google, Facebook and Twitter. The company noted that since its inception it has been losing money and "may not achieve or maintain profitability." Snapchat reportedly spurned a multibillion-dollar offer from Facebook, preferring to remain independent. Snap's offering on the New York Stock Exchange is the largest for a technology company in the US since Chinese-based Alibaba listed in 2014. The documents did not provide share pricing and noted that the amount to be raised could be revised before the market debut, which is likely to take place in March. While some analysts say Snap has the potential to challenge Facebook, others say it could end up like Twitter, which consistently lost money and whose existence as an independent firm is in peril. Global Equities Research analyst Trip Chowdhry advised investors in a note to steer clear of the IPO, calling the value of Snap "hyper-inflated." "We are at the tail end of social-media boom - novelty is giving way to fatigue," Chowdhry said in the note. "Durability is absent in SnapChat - it's the next Groupon, the next Zynga, the next GoPro, the next FitBit." All of those company's lost lustre after public debuts accompanied by high expectations. Snapchat will be competing with throngs of smartphone apps for advertising dollars, the analyst reasoned. The Snap IPO will be structured with different share classes, allowing co-founders Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy to control 88.6 per cent of the voting rights. Earlier Thursday, the New York Times said it would create a daily Edition for Snapchatters in the US, Canada and Australia based on its Morning Briefing, or summary of major news. This will appear on Discover, the section of the Snapchat app where users can find content from media companies. The Times cited data from Nielsen saying that Snapchat each day reaches 41 per cent of all 18-to 34-year-olds in the United States, compared to just six per cent for US network television. The company last year hit the market with camera-equipped sunglasses called "Spectacles" and renamed itself "Snap" to show it was no longer limited to a single product. The head of Sony's entertainment business stepped down Thursday to devote energy to Snap. The free service launched in 2012. Michael Lynton was leaving his job running the Japan-based company's pictures and music business as of February 2 to spend more time as chairman of the board of Snap Inc., Sony Corporation said in an earlier release. An investor in Snap, Lynton has been on the board nearly four years. He will stay on as "co-chief executive officer" of Sony Entertainment, working with Sony Corporation chief Kazuo Hirai to find a successor, according to the company. Sign up for our e-newsletter now!

De La Merced Show comments facebook SHARE twitter TWEET email google-plus linkedin reddit More Snapchat may have been built on disappearing messages, but as the social media darling hovers on the cusp of becoming a public company its parent is trying to show how durable its business is. In its first public prospectus, Snap disclosed that it had built a nearly $US405 million ($529 million) advertising business in just over two years. While the filing does not indicate a price for an initial public offering, Snap is expected to seek a market valuation of more than $US20 billion from investors.

Emilio Flores / The New York Times The pitch is straightforward: Snap is one of technology's biggest success stories of late, and it is heading to the public markets amid a relative dearth of noteworthy offerings. Still, company executives are expected to face questions about whether Snap can maintain its enormous growth rate, particularly as Facebook's Instagram unit copies many of Snapchat's major features. Potential investors may question the slowing growth rate of daily users, though Snap is likely to argue that it will continue to add new products that will accelerate growth. Related Content Snapchat parent kicks off $3.9b IPO The filing formally pulls back the curtain on Snap's meteoric growth. From 2011 to 2012, the number of people using the Snapchat app every day grew to 1 million from 1000. By the end of last year, an average of 158 million people were using the app daily. The average user opens the app more than 18 times a day, according to the prospectus, and the service's users send more than 2.5 billion messages and images each day. Advertisement Snap demonstrated in the prospectus that its business model is viable. Its annual revenue grew by about seven times in just a year, to $US404.5 million last year, from $US58.7 million in 2015. Martin Sorrell, chief executive of advertising conglomerate WPP, recently estimated that his company spent $US90 million on Snapchat last year. He called Snap a "rogue elephant," even as WPP deployed $US5 billion to Google and $US1.7 billion to Facebook in 2016. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link Snap's Spectacles, an example of a new product introduced by the company. Photo: Bloomberg "I would say Snapchat is the one thing that people look at and say, 'Maybe that's a third force that can counter the domination,'" Sorrell said last month, speaking at a conference held by Citigroup. Started in 2011 in a Stanford dorm room, Snap has grown from a curio for millennials into a broad social phenomenon. The start-up, founded by Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy, was originally built for users to send self-destructing photographs and messages to their friends. But Snap's ambitions have risen over time. It introduced ways for users to compile "stories" about their days and innovative filters that can transform faces to look like dogs or monsters — or, crucially, branded content like Taco Bell tacos. "When we were just getting started, many people didn't understand what Snapchat was and said it was just for sexting, even when we knew it was being used for so much more," the company said, employing what is surely one of the few uses of the word "sexting" in a regulatory filing. While generally seen as a social media company like Facebook and Twitter, Snap declared in its prospectus that it "is a camera company." And indeed last year, Snap introduced a line of camera-equipped sunglasses, Spectacles, which help funnel even more user content onto the platform. Snap also created Discover, allowing media companies to post content onto their own channels on the service. Who's going to be a billionaire? The biggest winners of Snap's IPO One of the more reliable paths to becoming a billionaire over the past 20 years has been to build a dominant technology company and then to take it public. That trend has led to Google billionaires, Facebook billionaires and a whole class of mere multimillionaires too. So who will be the ones to walk away the wealthiest from the coming public offering of Snap? The filing revealed some of the individuals and investors who have the most to gain from a successful market debut. We calculated the value of their stakes based on the fair market value of a share of Snap at the end of last year, when it was $US16.33. Here are some of the winners: EVAN SPIEGEL Spiegel, 26, was a founder of the company and now serves as Snap's chief executive and is a member of the board. According to the prospectus, he owns 227 million shares of the company, a stake that was worth $US3.7 billion at the end of last year. His regular compensation package was nothing to sniff at either. In 2016, he was paid $US2.6 million, including $US503,205 in base salary, a $US1 million bonus and $US901,635 in other compensation, which covered his $US890,339 personal security budget. BOBBY MURPHY Murphy, 28, helped found Snapchat when he and Spiegel were fraternity brothers at Stanford University. Murphy is now Snap's chief technology officer and a member of the board. Like Spiegel, Murphy owns 227 million shares of the company, which were worth $US3.7 billion at the end of last year. IMRAN KHAN Khan, 39, is a former investment banker who is now Snap's chief strategy officer. Khan owns 2.8 million shares of Snap, which were worth more than $US46 million at the end of last year. In 2016, Khan was paid a salary of $US241,539 and a bonus of $US5.2 million, as well as additional stock compensation of $US14,658. TIMOTHY SEHN ​Sehn, 36, is Snap's senior vice president of engineering. He owns almost 7 million shares of Snap, which were worth $US110 million at the end of last year. In addition, Sehn's 2016 base salary was $US400,152 and his bonus was $US1 million. He received a $US40 million stock award last year as well. BENCHMARK Benchmark, widely regarded as a premier Silicon Valley venture capital firm, invested in Snap in 2013 when the start-up was still known as Snapchat and was valued at $US60 million to $US70 million. The investment was spearheaded by a Benchmark partner, Mitch Lasky, who sits on Snap's board. According to Snap's prospectus, Benchmark owns 131.6 million shares of the company, a stake that was worth $US2.1 billion at the end of last year. LIGHTSPEED VENTURE PARTNERS Lightspeed was the first venture investor in Snap back in 2012, a year after Snapchat was launched. Jeremy Liew, a Lightspeed venture capitalist, led the investment. So how has that bet fared? According to Snap's prospectus, Lightspeed owns 86.6 million shares of the company, which were valued at $US1.4 billion at the end of last year. MICHAEL LYNTON Lynton, 57, the former chief executive of Sony's entertainment division, has long been a mentor to Spiegel. He announced last month that he would be leaving Sony to focus on Snap as a director and chairman of the board. Mr. Lynton owns 3 million shares of Snap, which were worth $US49.3 million at the end of last year. The New York Times 0 comments Log in to comment New User?

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    Among Silicon Valley's top tech employers, Facebook Inc could be the most vulnerable to U.S. President Donald Trump's expected crackdown on guest-worker visas, according to a Reuters analysis of U.S. Labor Department filings. More than 15 percent of Facebook's U.S. employees in 2016 used a temporary work visa, giving the social media leader a legal classification as a H-1B "dependent" company. That is a higher proportion than Alphabet Inc.'s Google, Apple Inc., Amazon.com Inc. or Microsoft Corp. That could cause problems for Facebook if Trump or Congress decide to make the H-1B program more restrictive, as the president and some Republican lawmakers have threatened to do. Both Trump and Attorney General nominee Senator Jeff Sessions have opposed the program in its current form. They have also indicated that they are open to reforming it to "ensure the beneficiaries of the program are the best and the brightest," according to a draft executive order seen by Reuters. Reuters could not immediately confirm the authenticity of the draft. The Trump administration has not proposed any new rules that would target companies with the H-1B "dependent" classification. But the fact that Facebook alone among major tech companies falls into that category suggests it is the most exposed in the industry to any changes in H-1B visa policy. Facebook declined to comment on the matter. Trump administration officials could not immediately be reached for comment. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said on Monday that Trump would target H-1B visas as part of a larger immigration reform effort through executive orders and Congressional action, but gave no details. H-1B visas are intended for foreign nationals in "specialty" occupations that generally require higher education, which according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) includes, but is not limited to, scientists, engineers or computer programmers. The government awards 85,000 every year, chiefly through a lottery system. Companies say they use them to recruit top talent. But a majority of the visas are awarded to outsourcing firms, sparking criticism by skeptics that those firms use the visas to fill lower-level information technology jobs. Critics also say the lottery system benefits outsourcing firms that flood the system with mass applications. H-1B dependent status is mostly held by these outsourcing firms such as India's Tata Consultancy Services or Infosys. The status was introduced in the late 1990s in an effort to ensure that companies did not use the visas to replace American workers with cheaper foreign labor. The status requires companies to prove they cannot find U.S. workers for the jobs. Facebook listed itself as a dependent company in its applications for H-1B visas with the Labor Department last year. Before he took office as president, Trump discussed changes to the H-1B visa program with top technology executives, including Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg. Those changes included possibly ending the lottery and replacing it with a system that would award the visas to the highest-paying jobs first, a move designed to reduce their issuance to outsourcing firms. Such a move could soften the blow from any H-1B changes for Facebook and other major technology companies. The average salary offered for Facebook H-1B jobs was $145,550, according to its application filings last year. Tata, a traditional outsourcing firm, offered $67,950 on average, barely above the $60,000 floor set by law for the H-1B program. The draft executive order did not mention specifics about the lottery. It did require the U.S. secretary of labor to provide the president with a report on "the actual or potential injury to U.S. workers caused, directly or indirectly, by work performed by nonimmigrant workers in the H-1B" visa program. "We are hoping that the final draft will have more details," said Russell Harrison, director of government relations at IEEE-USA, a group that represents U.S. engineers and favors that H-1B reform.   © 2017 Thomson/Reuters.

Additionally, GV has reportedly made a “significant” donation to the organization, calling it the most important investment it will make this year. As noted by Recode, you’ll now see a prompt on GV’s homepage to donate to the ACLU. “Please join us in donating to the ACLU, which defends American values of liberty and equal opportunity,” the prompt explains. Taking up the majority of the page, however, is a quote from Google CEO Sundar Pichai that says, “Let’s not let fear defeat our values.” Clicking on the header quote takes you to a Medium post that Pichai write in December of 2015, describing his journey coming to the U.S. from India more than 20 years ago. In the post, Pichai expressed concerns over the increasing intolerance toward immigrants and minorities. Here’s an excerpt from that 2015 post: And it’s not just about opportunity. The open-mindedness, tolerance, and acceptance of new Americans is one of the country’s greatest strengths and most defining characteristics. And that is no coincidence — America, after all, was and is a country of immigrants. Let’s not let fear defeat our values. We must support Muslim and other minority communities in the US and around the world. The ACLU prompt on the GV, formerly known as Google Ventures, website comes following a handful of other efforts from Google and its employees to oppose the immigration executive order from President Trump. While Pichai has publicly spoken out against the ruling,  Google employees have raised money and protested themselves. Additionally, Google is among a handful of companies behind a formal letter opposing the order.

Feind was inspired to volunteer at the camp after hearing the story about a pair of Fort Collins firefighters who rescued refugees in on the Mediterranean Sea. (Photo: Courtesy Harrison Feind) Harrison Feind didn't think of himself as a humanitarian worker or activist. Until he turned on the radio one day in mid-December. Feind, 26, listened to a story on Colorado Public Radio's Colorado Matters last month about a pair of Poudre Fire Authority firefighters who spent two weeks rescuing refugees from the Mediterranean Sea — an experience documented firsthand by this Fort Collins Coloradoan journalist. Inspired by the volunteer work, captivated by the tragedy and frustrated about what he deemed a lack of comprehensive coverage in U.S. media, Feind wanted to do something. So he went to Google. “I'll admit, I have not done a whole lot of volunteering in the past," Feind told the Coloradoan. "I’m not really proud of that. But after hearing about your story, I just decided to go. I was beyond nervous just because I had no expectations. I had no idea what I was going to get myself into." USA TODAY NYC bodegas close down in protest of Donald Trump’s immigration order By the end of the month, he was on a plane bound for Europe. During the first two weeks of January, Feind volunteered at Nea Kavala Refugee Camp in Northern Greece with A Drop in the Ocean, a nonprofit that provides direct aid to refugees. He was assigned to distribute clothing and food staples — salt, oil and a handful of vegetables — to the approximately 650 people living in crammed containers lining the camp that sits on an old airfield. Winds howled and temperatures plunged at the camp near the Macedonian border. Bitter cold froze water lines and transformed human waste in the portable toilets into a nauseating block of ice, Feind said. "It was bleak," he said. "It was miserable. There’s not really an adjective to really describe how horrible the conditions were.” But there was a bright spot — the people. Feind has fond memories of refugees, predominantly Syrians fleeing places like Aleppo and Damascus. Though they had almost no possessions and the conditions were a just a step up from squalor, many welcomed him into their pods and offered their scant food supplies in exchange for his conversation. "They were very welcoming," he said. Refugees at the Nea Kavala camp in Greece live in small containers, even in winter when frigid temperatures make being outside almost unbearable. Harrison Feind, of Colorado, spent two weeks volunteering at the camp after hearing a story about other Coloradans who were rescuing refugees in the area.  (Photo: Courtesy Harrison Feind) Feind went to high school in Boulder before moving to Washington, D.C., for college. He returned to Colorado in July and continues to work as an accountant. He arrived in Greece on Dec. 31, left on Jan. 14 for home, and was interviewed Monday on Colorado Matters. People have already extended offers to sponsor his next trip, he said. That interview came as conversation about refugees hit a boiling point. The weekend was marked by protest and confusion, locally and nationally, about President Donald Trump's executive order Friday that suspended admittance of Syrian refugees indefinitely and significantly scaled back the refugee admittance program. Trump justified the measure by saying it was necessary to more exhaustively screen refugees from certain countries seeking resettlement in the U.S., despite already lengthy and existing vetting processes. Feind criticized some coverage — and the lack of coverage — of the issues affecting Syria and neighboring countries. Too often, he said, that conversation is "drowned in political nonsense and bigotry." Now that he's back in Colorado, Feind is determined to spread the word about his experience. He's already working on plans to return, possibly for longer than just two weeks.

Critics included Uber drivers, many of whom are immigrants themselves. “Joining the group was not meant to be an endorsement of the president or his agenda but unfortunately it has been misinterpreted to be exactly that,” Kalanick, who had planned to attend a meeting of the group on Friday, said in an email to staff that was seen by Reuters. Read: Trump’s immigration ban: Apple’s Tim Cook considers legal action Uber spokeswoman Chelsea Kohler later confirmed that he had left the group. Social media campaigns had targeted Uber, urging users to delete accounts and opt for rival Lyft Inc. Uber has been emailing users who deleted their accounts to say it shares their concerns and will compensate drivers affected by the ban. Kalanick said he spoke briefly to Trump about the immigration order “and its issues for our community” and told the president he would not join the economic council. The CEO came under increasing pressure to leave the council after Trump issued an executive order temporarily barring people from seven majority-Muslim nations from entering the United States. “There are many ways we will continue to advocate for just change on immigration but staying on the council was going to get in the way of that. The executive order is hurting many people in communities all across America,” he wrote in a note to employees. “Families are being separated, people are stranded overseas and there’s a growing fear the US is no longer a place that welcomes immigrants.” Read: Google’s Sundar Pichai slams Trump’s Muslim ban, recalls employees back to US The White House said in a statement Thursday evening that did not mention Uber that Trump “understands the importance of an open dialogue with fellow business leaders to discuss how to best make our nation’s economy stronger.” The move could put pressure on other CEOs expected to attend a meeting with Trump on Friday. General Motors Co said its chief executive would attend, while Walt Disney Co said earlier Thursday its chief executive would not attend because of a long-planned board meeting. Others expected to take part include the CEOs of JPMorgan Chase & Co, Blackstone Group LP, IBM Corp and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. Others that are part of the council include Tesla Inc CEO Elon Musk, PepsiCo Inc CEO Indra Nooyi and Boston Consulting Group CEO Rich Lesser.

Kalanick’s departure could signal a growing rift between technology companies and Washington. “There is a battle brewing between Trump and Silicon Valley,” said Neeraj Agrawal, general partner at Battery Ventures. “They (the Trump administration) clearly don’t value the economic activity generated by tech.” Microsoft Corp on Thursday said it proposed a modification of Trump’s travel limits. Read: Google, Netflix, other tech companies meet to challenge Trump immigration order Technology companies including Microsoft, Google owner Alphabet Inc, Apple Inc and Amazon.com Inc have opposed Trump’s order, arguing that they rely on workers from around the world. Amazon and Expedia Inc have filed court documents supporting a legal challenge to the order by the Washington state attorney general. tags more from tech Apple moves closer to iPhone assembly in India Feb 03, 2017 08:47 IST Samsung unveils India’s first curved gaming monitor Feb 02, 2017 19:50 IST 10 Financial Mistakes to Avoid Promotional feature Recommended for you India World Business Education Autos Real estate Opinion Analysis Columns Editorials Blogs Authors Cities Delhi Gurgaon Noida Mumbai Bhopal Chandigarh Dehradun Indore Jaipur Kolkata Lucknow Patna Ranchi Sports Cricket Football Tennis Others Entertainment Movie reviews Bollywood Hollywood Regional movies World cinema TV Music Tabloid Lifestyle Sex & relationship Health & fitness Fashion & trends Art & culture Travel Books Brunch Tech Tech Reviews Gadgets Photos Videos Epaper HT Indepth Punjab Livemint Livehindustan Shine HTcampus Desimartini HTsyndication Follow us on: Newsletter Register with Hindustan Times to get best news and articles Copyright © HT Media Limited All rights reserved.

Skip to navigation Skip to content Skip to sidebar News National More N.B. farmer convicted of harassing neighbours with giant manure pile vows to appeal ruling The Canadian Press  02.02.2017 For almost a year, this manure pile sat on the edge of David and Joan Gallant’s property in Indian Mountain, N.B., as part of an escalating feud with their neighbours. “The manure was piled high and a photo taken by Google (Earth) from a satellite shows it.” ShareAdjustCommentPrint MONCTON, N.B. — A bizarre feud over Lee Murray’s massive pile of manure has left the New Brunswick farmer steaming mad. The ugly quarrel with Murray’s next-door neighbours, the Gallants, made international headlines this week when a judge ordered he pay them $17,000 in costs and damages, saying he had used his tractor to build a fetid wall of feces along the Gallants’ property line to make them miserable. Murray, who has lived all his life on Indian Mountain near Moncton, N.B., said Thursday he is planning to file an appeal. “There was a lot of questions my lawyer didn’t ask in court,” he said in an interview from his home. “I’ve been self-employed all my life and this is the worst mess I’ve ever been into. This is nuts.” Murray, a cattle farmer, said his family got along just fine with Joan and David Gallant until about six years ago, when Joan Gallant complained about getting too much of the Murrays’ junk mail. “It was downhill after that,” Murray said. At the centre of the dispute is the Gallants’ assertion that Murray and his son deposited hundreds of loads of raw cow manure on a strip of land adjacent to the Gallant property in November 2013. “He was just roaring across with the tractor and the windows were shaking in the house,” David Gallant said in an interview, adding that the pungent dumping continued into the wee hours. The pile eventually grew to be about 18 metres long, 13 metres wide and as high as his nearby three-car garage, David Gallant said. He said he asked Murray to move the pile, but he refused. Murray said he had no choice but to put the pile near the garage because to do otherwise would have been unsafe. He said it was late in the fall, the ground was wet and slippery from recent rains, and it would have been dangerous to move the manure down an adjacent hill. The frustrated farmer insisted the mound — Gallant called it a “manure mountain” — soon froze solid and did not stink at all. “We couldn’t spread it or nothing because it got too late in the year,” Murray said. “My lawyer didn’t explain to the judge that seasoned manure and frozen manure doesn’t smell.” Photos taken at the time show a large, dark mass near the garage, some of it seeping under a wire fence and onto the Gallants’ property. Justice George Rideout of the Court of Queen’s Bench concluded that Murray dumped the dung to antagonize the Gallants, saying his actions were “wilful and reprehensible.” Comments We encourage all readers to share their views on our articles and blog posts.
