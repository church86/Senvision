Don't Change Your Google Password Before Factory Resetting Your Android Phone - You Might Trip A 72-Hour Security Lockout David Ruddock Follow View All Posts 2015/07/13 3:19pm PDTJul 13, 2015 639 Plus 1 on G+ 763 Share on Facebook 6 Share on Twitter Total Shares1408 Android OS Tips & Tutorials Article Contents 1 Why am I locked out of my phone for 72 hours? 2 Why is this a feature?

This isn't a news story, but more of a "public service announcement" about an Android feature not everyone may be aware of. If you've ended up here because your Android phone is telling you that, after a factory reset, you cannot log into your device for 72 hours (3 days), I don't have much good news: you're going to have to wait it out. If you want to know why exactly this happens, regardless of whether or not it has affected you, this post will at least show you how to avoid falling victim to this security measure again if you find it to be too much trouble, as well as why this feature exists to begin with. Why am I locked out of my phone for 72 hours? Back in March 2015, Google introduced a feature called Device Protection in its newly-released version of Android, 5.1 Lollipop. Part of this new suite of security tools was something called Factory Reset Protection. This is the source of the 72-hour device lockout. It is tripped by resetting your Google account password and then performing a factory reset on an Android device (with Device Protection, meaning it runs 5.1+) that account is connected to. This feature is designed to allow you time to regain control of your Google account in the event it is compromised because your phone was stolen. Think of it this way: if somebody changes the lock on a security door (your phone) the night before the building gets robbed, do you think the person changing the lock (or someone else at the lock company) might have been in on it? That's essentially the logic of factory reset protection. The idea is that your Google account and password are the "lock" and "key" that are required to open your Factory Reset Protection-enabled device (the door) after it undergoes a factory reset, and that by changing your Google account password, you're "tampering" with the lock right before you enter the door - which is suspicious. And so at that point, Google initiates a 72-hour hold on sign-ins to that "door." After that 72 hours expires, you still need to log in with the previously-connected Google account's password. The difference is that during the hold, you just can't log in at all - after the hold is over, you obviously still need to verify the account password. Why is this a feature? Isn't this insane overkill? The reason the hold is triggered is that, once your Google account is compromised on a stolen phone (easy enough to do - the thief has your Gmail and probably your phone number), there is essentially no other way to stop a thief from successfully erasing all traces of your account ever having been on said phone, since a wipe can be done directly from the recovery menu on bootup without any sort of authorization (PIN/pattern protected startup does not prevent this). That 72 hours theoretically gives you time to get your Google account back under your control and change the password again, making the thief's attempts to log in futile. If you're wondering why a thief would know your Google account password and not your PIN/pattern lock, that's actually more likely to happen than you might think: it's completely possible to reset your Google account password without knowing the current one if you've got somebody's smartphone. Two-factor authentication generally relies on SMS, so the thief would get the authenticator on your stolen phone, and you probably would also have your backup email account synced to that smartphone as well (which, hey, good personal security idea: don't put your backup account on your phone). Generally speaking, it is comparatively much, much harder to change the lock screen on a phone if you don't know the existing PIN, pattern, or password, and short of social engineering or plain luck, that's hard information to get. Is there any way around factory reset protection once it's triggered? Sadly, no. Once the protection system is tripped, you've got a functionally useless smartphone until that 3-day lockout expires. If you've been locked out of your device and are looking for a workaround, sorry: there isn't one that we're aware of. You're going to have to wait (you also cannot sign in to the phone using another account - this would kind of defeat the purpose of the feature). Those affected by this problem have confirmed Google support is of no help in the matter - they'll just tell you to wait out the timer, during which time your phone has all the utility of a paperweight. This suggests Google really has no control over the timer itself once it's been triggered, though we can't be sure. Can I disable this feature (Factory Reset Protection / Device Protection)? Nice try, phone thieves! But really, in the interest of full disclosure, yes - you can disable all Device Protection features (and it is an all-or-nothing switch), including Factory Reset Protection, and doing so is relatively quick and painless on supported devices. Here is the process. Enable developer options on your phone (Google it - it's easy, usually you just go into the settings, "about phone," find the build number (might be under software), and then tap it until it says "You are now a Developer!") Go to developer options and find "Enable OEM unlock." Check the box, and hit "enable." You will get a warning saying this will disable device protection features, and this includes factory reset protection. And I've tested it - factory reset protection no longer works with this checkbox enabled. If your device does not have an "allow OEM unlocking" option, that means one of two things. First, it most likely means it doesn't support factory reset protection to begin with, and that your phone is not protected in the event someone wipes it (or it may have a 3rd party solution!). Second, it could just mean the company that made your phone (or the carrier) decided not to include the OEM unlock toggle and is kind of a dick, and in that case, you only have one option, and it's a bad one (bottom of this section). As to what "allowing OEM unlocking" really does, it basically tells the system that the bootloader is authorized to be unlocked (note: not the same as actually unlocking it) and that Android won't stop you in the event you should attempt to do it. And yes, this makes your phone less secure, because it potentially means a thief could flash custom software to your phone, etc., and Google is politely saying it's not their problem if something bad happens when you do this. If you don't want to use the Enable OEM Unlock method or do not have such a toggle, the only other practical option to disable ADP is to run with an unsecured lock screen. Not very appealing, right? Android Device Protection requires that you have a PIN, pattern, or password for your lockscreen in order to function. Without those things, its features become useless anyway - accounts can be removed from the device without any additional authorization, and thus there's really no protection to begin with. How do I know if my phone has Factory Reset Protection? The easiest way is to just do a factory reset (while logged in to the device with a Google account and a screen PIN/pattern set) and see if you get the following dialog on startup. If you do, you've got factory reset protection. If you don't, you either don't have it or it's disabled. Device Protection should be on almost any Android device that shipped with Android 5.1 or higher out of the box. It will also work on some phones that shipped with some version of 5.0 (5.0, 5.0.1, 5.0.2), such as the Galaxy S6, and were later updated to Android 5.1 or higher. Is there any warning about this when I factory reset my phone? Nope... which seems really bad on Google's part, if I'm honest. Devices should clearly state as part of the factory reset dialogue that they will be completely locked and rendered unusable if you've changed your Google password in the last 72 hours. Does this let phone thieves know how the system works? Certainly, but it still accomplishes the purpose (prevents a wipe), and it would be much better for end users. People have already encountered this feature unwittingly after resetting their Google account passwords, only to be locked out of their only phone for 3 days with absolutely no way to resolve the issue - and these people did nothing wrong. It's totally ridiculous that this is how it works, and Google should most definitely address it. So, the lesson? In the event you change your Google account password, you must wait three days before factory resetting any of your Android 5.1+ devices you use with that account unless you have explicitly disabled Android Device Protection on them. If you factory reset one of your Android devices before those 3 days are up and then attempt to sign into that device with your Google account, you will be met with an error message and not allowed to log into the device with any account until 72 hours after the password reset occurred, which is a major bummer.

IT Admin: "Why are these people still complaining that security settings are too low?" Sorry, power users. In case you've forgotten, Android is still the OS of the masses, and the masses prefer security over absolute account-level autonomy (thank that Wired editor). CoreRooted Honestly, I think Google is right about not lifting the 72 hour period on their end. We would be even more annoyed if all it took was a phone call to Google to unlock the device after it being stolen. If the thief has your device AND changed the password on it, then yes, they have your info. There isn't much that Google can do to say that the caller isn't you. I really can't see any of this as a negative. David Ruddock The lack of being informed that it will happen is the broken part. I agree a hard lockout is fine in theory, but not if you had zero idea it would happen in the first place unless you read an obscure support article. CoreRooted That's a good point (and then one thing in the article that I was shaking my head at). Google has never really been good at announcements, documentation, and marketing. I was trying to think of an instance where Google wouldn't want to let people know about this, but I really can't. It's something we WANT thieves to know about and users also. cpaixao The lock works not because changing password is suspicious, but because you might want to avoid thief from receiving emails at your logged account and browsing your personal data on apps with your account. Despite of that, you'll still able to lock and/or wipe your device with GDM from anywhere. This is the reason for GDP logic. bo ure Thanks for the acronyms, techie Genius. It renders your sentence meaningless unless we know wtf you're talking about or look them up. Bon Hey DAVID! Im not a theft i own a s6 edge plus i forgot my previous passowrd on my google accnt and may back up password in case my fingerprint will fail, now ive got 72hrs locked out. Its really heartbreaking. Is there any other way for me again to use my phone? Is it possible if i changed my password in my google accnt and used it after 72hrs locked out i can use already my s6 edge? Pls do help me. :( victoria atwood Hi can u tell me if I have this 72 hour thing..I turn my phone on it asks me for wiFi then asked me for google email and password .it tellseems me to sign in with owners account but I am the owner..I can't get on home screen or anything..I've only had my smsung edge 6 plus 2 days..Please help before I cracked up ..Thanks x David Navarro i have the same issue right now it tells me to sign in with owners account and Im using the same account can you tell me if your issue was fixed after 72 hours please. It doesn't say anything about 72 hours Shan Yousaf Hey i have the same issue yesterday. i have same error( please sign in with owners account) Kindly telll me is this issue will be resolved after 72 hours? TCH I just run into the issue today and there was no warning from google, what a shame. Oh well nothing to do now but wait those 72 stinking hours but lesson learned. Akshay I have a Moto G3, I first factory reset it in recovery mode, then changed the password from the phone. Now the phone is not allowing me to login, it returns password error with old password, but accepts new password, but after checking the new password it returns the same verification screen. Currently going through 72-hours lockout and tried many times with new password. So, after the 3 days are over, will I be able to login in my moto g3 with new password? Moirrainefortruth Well, there should be a way to go around it if you send a code from your own darn email. Google doesn't get security, they just pretend they do. Shane Johnson Honestly the phone states this when you initially setbup your first gmail with the phone. The people whobare affected by this and “surprised" are peoplr who SKIP through the set up screens. So shame on them bo ure Oh, F.U., it's impossible to read every g.d. little thing this miserable phone throws at you. EowynCarter That. No point in a security measure that can be bypassed. Though a warning would be nice indead. I finally let my bootloader unlocked. Not safe, but I'm afraid that it might prevent me from fixing my own phone in case of bootloop. Don I disagree. I'm in this situation right now. My brother sold me his phone and I asked him for his login to unlock it, but before that I decided to factory reset it to clear it. Unbeknownst to me, he was resetting his password at the same time. Now I'm toast. mfr118 Just so everyone knows I'm the reason for this PSA. Thanks Artem and David for all your help the other day. CoreRooted Ugh... sorry that hit you. 3 days without my DD would drive me insane. mfr118 Insane wouldn't be the word I'd use. I was stuck using my companies iPhone for 3 days. I wanted to eat a bullet Artem Russakovskii You and https://plus.google.com/u/0/+ChadCooper/posts/i2F9N1mjoVG https://plus.google.com/u/0/+ChadCooper/posts/Py5rkHYUZry mfr118 Well thanks again for the help the other day. You guys actually take the time to help unlike those other "Central" Android sites Guest Why would anyone mess with my Google account if they stole my phone? I'm not sure if I understand this feature. David Ruddock You can't wipe the phone to the point of it being resellable without that password - Factory Reset Protection requires it to be verified on boot after a factory reset, and Android won't fully start until the password of the last account on the device is verified. Tl;dr - if you don't have the Google account password (or get locked out after trying to change it), you can't resell the phone. Guest Oh I didn't know that, thanks for explaining. Can't you just log out of the original owner's account and delete the data of Play services, etc. before trying to do a factory reset? David Ruddock That requires the device PIN / pattern / password from the lockscreen, which must be set up for these features to turn on in the first place. GryphKid44 How can a thief change your password without being able to get past the lockscreen? It seems they would have to change your password from a different device which means that they have access to another device as well. David Ruddock It would be unlikely, but entirely possible if they steal your phone while it's not locked (eg BT smart lock, long lock timeout, etc.) nehpets In this instance where somebody has your phone unlocked already, what is preventing them from just enabling the OEM Unlock for their own use? I don't remember the developer options requiring pin/password, etc. EowynCarter Nothing. That's the reason smart lock can be used after I set my work account on my phone.Not safe. All about security vs convenient nehpets So that makes this 72 hour lockout period worthless. It will catch a whole lot of people doing nothing wrong, while anybody who nefariously reset somebody else's password using their stolen cell phone would also take 2 seconds to enable the OEM unlock and not have any issues. Brad You need the pin to turn it off whether or not the phone is "smart" unlocked... so they can't disable it. nehpets That makes a whole lot more sense. Prezes Dyrektor what about flashing a different rom? perhaps even an older version stock? wouldn't that work around this protection? EowynCarter Only if the bootloader in unlocked. And as default, you have to allow the unlock in the developers settings. Or fastboot oem unlock says access denied. Dabu So what am I supposed to do, if I'm selling a phone with this feature? CoreRooted Probably wipe the device first and then change your password afterward would be safer. Walker86 Actually that may not help in all cases. I just got hit with this because of a glitch on my Samsung Galaxy S6 where it suddenly failed to read my fingerprint and asked for my backup password, which it didn't recognize either. T-Mobile suggested a factory wipe to recover the phone, but it wouldn't recognize my google account afterwards. So, they passed me on to Samsung support who suggested I change my google account password to see if that would help - and bang here I am for 72 hours. Whatever the intention, this is a poorly thought out implementation of the concept. There should be a way to validate legitimate owners and bypass this lockout. Tardaboveme Turn off the lockscreen, then remove the google account from the phone. That should let you wipe it without it coming up after the fdr. David Ruddock Correct. ALUOp You don't change your password when you sell your phone, so you don't need to worry about this feature. Just wipe the phone. Despite the length of this article, it doesn't explain things very clearly. Cory S read more. http://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/nexus2cee_Screenshot_2015-03-12-16-48-37_thumb.png ALUOp I don't understand your point. I was telling Dabu that he needs not worry about the 72-hour thing, which this article is trying to explain and apparently got him confused. Cory S When you wipe your phone you need to sign back in with the original account to unlock it.. That part has nothing to do with password changes.. ALUOp Where in my previous comments did I say or imply signing in after wipe has anything to do with password changes? Please read or re-read my previous comments. All I said is Dabu doesn't need to worry about the 72-hour blackout this article is trying to explain. Cory S He asked what he needed to do when he sold a phone with this feature...which disabels a device after a factory reset until the original owner signs back in. He was given the correct answer above, yours would had resulted in a new owner opening up a paper weight. Demetria Streeter thats what mine is saying right now ToniLKerns ====Lates Quality performance androidpolice ...... <**** Find Here Trooper311 Happened to me about a month or so ago. I contacted Google and was told there was no way around it, even though I pressed the issue. Lesson learned the hard way. After 72 hours was up, I was able to log back in. mciuccio Hey, I just did the same thing, I changed my google password, because of a blackshades hack on my work PC. and also in trying to clean up my Note 5 I did a factory reset on it also. I have tried to log back into my Note 5 every day, I also have 2 step verification turned on now with my google account. So currently my sim card is in an iPhone 5 I suppose for three days from now, after reading this article. I am just wondering will I have to try to log in with my new google password or my old one I changes? Does anyone know? Jey New one Bunklung There was another Android Police article on Factory Reset Protection and someone posted a comment indicated that even with an unlocked bootloader and allow OEM unclocking that factory reset protection still worked even when reflashing the device to stock. The account check/FRP happens server side. http://www.androidpolice.com/2015/03/12/guide-what-is-android-5-1s-antitheft-device-protection-feature-and-how-do-i-use-it/#comment-1903978565 I think this complicates resale too. If the seller doesn't remove FRP (pin/password/pattern) and factory resets the phone and throws it in a mail, that's a sad day for the buyer. I wonder if Swappa will disclaim this. There are a few comments about unintended resale consequences: http://www.androidpolice.com/2015/03/12/guide-what-is-android-5-1s-antitheft-device-protection-feature-and-how-do-i-use-it/#comment-1982676882 Normally a seller and a buyer are always aware of the ESM/MEID status, but now the big question will be, "Is FRP disabled and the phone reset to factory???", in each listing right next to ESN status. TylerChappell This article helps make all the theives better theives. ;D Their only requirement now is to pick out a person they think would be too lazy or incompetent to regain control of their account within 3 days. Brad You can't fix stupid. TylerChappell Lol right you are, sir! João Victor Schiavo I liked the article a lot, but I got confused at some parts. I read it again and again, and now the only part I didn't get very well is this: "Two-factor authentication generally relies on SMS, so the thief would get the authenticator on your stolen phone, and you probably would also have your backup email account synced to that smartphone as well" Could anyone explain me this? Thank you. :) lamenting Let's say your backup email account was a Yahoo account. You might have the Yahoo Mail app on that same phone. So if you change your password on your Google account to block the thief, the thief could request Google to send the login reset email to your backup email account - your Yahoo account - and compromise your Google account. So don't put your backup email account on your phone. :) João Victor Schiavo But if my phone has a PIN, he can't see the email received, right? Also, what about the first part, before the last comma? That's what I didn't understand. PS: I don't use a backup email for my main account. :P blindexecutioner Your phone is the authenticator. João Victor Schiavo But how? You mean my phone number? But he wouldn't be able to see the message my phone receives, be it by email or by sms. CoreRooted That isn't necessarily true. Lollipop allows you to have your notifications displayed on your lockscreen... EVEN if you have it locked with a pin, password or pattern. The contents are still there. So, yes, a thief COULD see the SMS code or the code in the email (depending on client and such). It is possible. Internet Guardian Good article!! Now can someone please let me the know the best way to Reset/Format a device Android 5.1 device before selling it? Alexander Sofinskiy Yeah! I am looking for that too, how to reset your phone before selling? and how to not get locked with used devices which I bought from somebody?? yankeesusa There was a cnet article on this. here is a quick way, first things first, don't reset until you activate encryption. Then after you encrypt the phone, factory reset. This should be good for most people. If you want to go even further, then after factory reset, go back in the phone and add a bunch of fake info, then factory reset again. Do this several times if you want. After all this, remember to unencrypt phone. Of course some phones will not let you hard reset unless you decrypt. I think the g3 does this. Ali Mahdavi Thank you Android Police, it was really useful! blindexecutioner Thanks. I very well could have done this around the time a new version of Android drops. CoreRooted Nope. In fact, if you are selling the device, you should just wipe it (I do this about 5 times just to be sure) and then DON'T log back into it. Change your password for the account the device was previously setup with after you wipe it (the changing of it before the wipe is what triggers FRP) and you should be good. sugarwer765 Power Read police article < w­­­w­­­w.­­­­N­e­t­C­a­s­h­­­9­­.­­­C­­­o­­­m Peter Siegmund I don't have the "allow OEM unlocking" on my Nexus 4 (with Android 5.1.1). Where can I find this in the developer options? EowynCarter Not there on my nexus 4 either. Erroneus I believe Nexus 4 doesn't have the necessary hardware to support the needed encryption, which is why this feature is not present. Nexus 4 owner here my self. Arpan Malviya Not on my N5 either Teodor Axel Johan Jönsson You can't. Nexus 4 and 5 don't have that option cabbieBot Did this one get rushed out the door or was it intended to just address stock users? Because that's the only way it makes sense. Those of us who want SU and have our bootloaders unlocked are still out here, ya know. So, some questions. 1) Factory Reset. Let's get that defined. I take it that the article primarily addresses the aftermath of what happens when you choose the option in the "Backup & Reset" submenu in Settings, and selecting the choice for a Factory Data Reset at the bottom, below all the "please generate a hash of my soul's identity and back it up please" options. * But, that's still not clear. There is also this line: "since a wipe can be done directly from the recovery menu on bootup." What recovery? Stock recovery? What if I have CWM or TWRP as a custom recovery, does it trip it? And goodness, how would it if I factory reset using a custom recovery? What If I just dirty flash a ROM update when I've changed a password to an account on the phone? Or do a wipe of any/all partitions from a custom recovery, flash a brand new ROM, and reboot? Or restore a nandroid? What is phoning home? 2) This occurs for any google account the phone is locked into? So, if I have a secondary (or tertiary, even!) google account logged into my phone, this applies there too? 3) I have an LG G3 and the recent firmware update (ZVA) was to backport this feature to the current android version we are on (5.0.1). There is no OEM Unlocking option menu, either, but the article says there are only two cases when that will happen. Can we expect similar behavior? CoreRooted To answer #1 (from what I understand from the support docs: https://support.google.com/nexus/answer/6172890?hl=en), it isn't the action of wiping that is the trigger. It's the setup AFTER the wipe. The recovery type (stock, CWM, TWRP, etc) shouldn't matter. When you go into setup (and enter in the network info), the device contacts Google to determine if it is participating in the Factory Reset Protection (easy enough to do as Google keeps a UUID of every device that has Android installed running 5.x+)). Most likely the trigger is that something has changed on the /data or /system partitions (maybe even lower level than that) and that is what triggers the lock. As for #2, it applies to the device. So, if you signed in with [email protected] , change the password and then factory reset, ANY ACCOUNT will be locked out of that device. You can still use your account on other devices (and with the web), but not on THAT device. The device, at this point, can ONLY be unlocked with your account and new password. For a thief, they essentially have a brick in their possession. So, even if you have [email protected] , you still won't be able to sign into THAT device. #3) Unknown at this point. I also have a G3 and I haven't changed my password in about 40 days. I don't really WANT to test it, but I'm willing to bet that LG made it so that we cannot turn off the FRP at all. yankeesusa This is a great feature to have. But there should be a warning on phones and online letting you know that their is a possibility of a 72hour lockout. Other than that I'm glad they are doing this. CoreRooted There's a support article... Buried deep within Google's docs for the Nexus line. lol... https://support.google.com/nexus/answer/6172890?hl=en yankeesusa I'll take a part time job just to read the docs LOL. They should post a warning on the phone itself though. Maybe with enough complaints they will. Blackangel3942 I can think of one reason why they do not post a clear warning: and that is so that it can catch the potential thief off-guard, and apparently it works as it caught David and many others off-gaurd. DanSan Good information here, thanks guys. I use 2 factor authentication but dont use SMS as a way to get codes. I have a set of printed codes i keep locked at home and use the google authenticator app on my devices. it is also password protected separately inside the phone. dont have my recovery email on that phone either, didnt even think of that before. DanSan If you didn't know about the 3 day lock out prior to doing a wipe I can completely understand that and I feel for people. On the other hand, to complain about Google not being able to reset it is very different. its like yelling at your bank for asking you security questions when you try to call them up and access your account. its protecting you for a reason and if that security is simply compromised with a simple phone call there is no reason for having it in the first place. Maybe they could add something to clear the hold once you're back into your account but im not sure if that would put any holes in this defense or not. either enforce it all the time or never, thats how security works. DanSan im still very curious about the effects of having unlocked bootloader. I originally unlocked the bootloader of my nexus 6 when it was on 5.0 and updated it manually to 5.1.1. its still unlocked but the oem unlocking toggle is not turned on. if i try to turn it on im greeted with the pin screen and a warning telling me it wont work anymore. have we 100% confirmed this? im already bootloader unlocked so i dont really care but curious how it could effect locking/unlocked bootloaders. CoreRooted It shouldn't affect the bootloader at all. With FRP enabled, you can wipe the device 100 times and the result will still be the same. It's the setup (the phone home to Google) after reboot that determines if you are locked out or not. dannyR Google implements tight security (or tight anything) only when it doesn't affect them financially. You're scrued for 3 days? Tough beans. Aris Routis The fact you're not warned,is the right thing to do. It would defeat the purpose of having such a mechanism in place if you were to announce it in the first place. Murilo Antas Pereira Happened to me on a 3rd gen moto g. Even with no security set on lockscreen. Cindy Craig I changed my Google password, did a factory reset on my phone and ended up here. Now, once the 72 hour lockout is over, do I enter my old password or new Google password into my phone to activate it again? I am unclear...and would appreciate any help Mahak Bansal Same Situation....What to do?///// WHAT WAS THE SOLUTION?????? Cindy Craig The only solution is to wait the full 72 hours, then enter your new google password into your phone. Then, it will work normally. In the meantime, I put my SIM card into an old phone that I had while I waited. rayan tahir i have changed my google password after factory reset from recovery mode. I cannot open frp lock what can I do now? pntless I just got nailed by this. Maybe do a reminder post since Marshmallow images just pushed? Jerry What a nightmare..... Google blames Samsung, Samsung blames Google, Sprint throws their hands up in the air and points to both Samsung and Google. Legitimate owners are caught in this finger pointing exercise and quoted company policy and we have to wait 72 hours. Insane. bo ure Quite. Jerry So can anyone tell me about FRP Unlock applications that are being offered in other forums? Pramit Bhattacharyya I changed my gmail account password last night.After that I had a hard reset on my mobile device but I stuck in the sign in loop.It shows ''this device was reset.To continue sign in with th e google account that was previously synced on this device.'' What to do? Should I wait 72 hours.After that can this device will open by putting my new gmail password? Mahak Bansal same dude....STUCKED HELP GUYZZZ DANIEL S wait 72 hrs!!! pcnexus http://www.pcnexus.net/2015/12/what-is-factory-reset-protection-google-72-hour-lockout-android-lollipop.html Eric Paroissien Excellent article and helpful. Mel I just bought my Son a Droid Turbo for his Birthday like 2 weeks ago. He is 14 and forgetful so he has locked himself out of his phone and can't remember his gmail email or password. I understand the wait 72 hour thing but when I called Motorola they said after 72 hours it would give me the option to make a new google email and get in that way. After reading these comments I am thinking the guy at Motorola is wrong. Also if that is the case his phone is unusable so money down the drain. Am I correct? Verizon is our carrier and they suggested I call Motorola. ryan have you heard anythiing back? Jonathan Hawkins I was locked out of my Samsung Galaxy phone but did find a company called RockIT Repairs that can remove the Factory Reset Protection from any Android phone. They charged me $50 to do the FRP removal. This is the link for their removal service http://rockitrepairs.com/frp-factory-reset-protection-removal/ . I hope this help someone like it did me after being locked out of my phone. GabbyGibby This happened to me when I took my new galaxy 5 note to the ATT store because my bluetooth was not working in my car well they had to do a hard reboot I forgot my password for google she said no problem will just change your password Here I am on the third day of my lock out Thank You AT&T. After calling her supervisor because we couldn't get into my phone she apologized and said sorry there is a 72 hour lock I didn't know about this. Well we know now don't we. Thank you for this article I loved it and I'm passing it on for other people so they don't have to go through this. Will This is completely ridiculous and absurd. Ok, i can understand the need fit ask the security, I'm up for all that. What really gets me riled up is that Google does not inform is users of the update and even are you have been locked out, you still don't know why, or for how long and not only that, here i am on the phone with my service provider trying to figure out how to get accesd to my phone and all but still, nothing. I cant even finish setting up my phone, or even skip the google account set up and just be able to at least use my phone period. After getting my replacement phone two days ago, my finger scanner was failing to work, had forgotten my new backup password, it wouldn't log me on with my google account, thought THAT password might be wrong so I changed it. That was not working so i got on the phone with my service provider and street about half an hour end up having to do a hard rest on my phone. So evening stated up just fine, but then i get that screen saying the phone was reset, to use account that was previously synced on device, goes to next scrern, let's me ounch in password, then back to 'VERIFY YOUR ACCOUNT' and stuck in a never ending loop. If you are locked out at least tell me I'm locked out and for how long, instead of making me loop in the hopes i might have puncged in my password wrong or m7spelled my account email, but it just asks yo enter the information. So it took another hour long phonecall with my service provider, which ended up in another factory reset, and after tech support did some digging, found this article informing me about this. Now I'm stuck unable to use phone. There has to be something Google can do about this, I'm sure they wouldnt write a program without being able to bypass it and letting you acces your stuff sgai. What if there was an emergency or something? Im sure that if your phone was stolen, you'd report it, and get on a computer and wiped thee stolen veice remotely or locked it or something. When i lost my phone once, i immediately got online locked it, and not being able to find it, erased it, called my service provider and had service stopped on phone so as to not allow anyone else use or access to my i formation. Obiously Google does have a way to verify that it's you and not someone else trying to get accesd to your device or even your acvount, with so many security measures in place. Has Google received enough complaints about this? Enough to make some kind of change? pcnexus The 72-hour lockout is by default active. So, if you do a factory reset in recovery mode, you still won't be able to login and verify device ownership for the first 72-hours. I didn't change the password after factory reset and the device is now not allowing me to login and verify. Waiting for 3 days to pass, previously unlocked the phone after 3 days. RE Casper Here is another fun point [sarc]... I ran into this problem myself, waited the 72hrs and after I still couldn't get back in, I contacted Google Customer Service. The answer I got... "Call Motorola about getting the phone replaced".... Now, here I sit, $600+ paperweight of a phone in hand. So, moral of the story... it's not just getting locked you should be worried about with this "new security feature". You may just end up with an inaccessible device and far more than 3 days of having no phone, like I have. pcnexus You can unlock the phone. Read this tutorial. I have unlocked the phone 2-3 times after FRP is initiated. http://www.pcnexus.net/2015/12/what-is-factory-reset-protection-google-72-hour-lockout-android-lollipop.html Peter Goodstadt Thanks for that info it worked a treat to reset my one plus for reselling.Peter G Nony I hate this feature more than anything. Im always changing my password to my gmail, and i have a really insecure boyfriend who always tries to put spyware on my phone, so im always resetting it. I dont know how many times I've been locked out of my phone in emergency situations because of this. I NEVER HAVE A WORKING PHONE!!!. It makes me want to switch to Apple. I am so over Android because of this feature!!! Stephen Can I ask someone on this blog to answer a question I have regarding my Moto e. I'm an old guy, 64, not a techie like you folk are. I do not text. Fingers too fat, eyes too bad. I don't want to email anyone or anyone to email me via my phone. I have an email account on Gmail for that. Why does my phone keep noticing me that I need to enter the correct password for ????? It says it 'Couldn't sign in'. I don't know if I want or need it to do so. Any idea as to why I should provide my email password? I understand it was set up by my son an IT guy but I change my password every 6 months or so and after changing it this last time, I started getting this request. Thanks much Sajeev Pattath Thanks for info. I am facing the same problem for my moto g3. it auto updated to android 6 and there is some issues. No incoming calls are getting on phone . Then i changed password and done factory reset. after seeing this at least i am happy that i may able to use my phone after 72hrs Lead Poisoner Didi it work after 72 hours? Chris Lee After the 72 hour wait period, am I going to use the password that I changed it to? or do I need to know the original one which I prob don't know pcnexus Please read this article to completely get out of this lockout. http://www.pcnexus.net/2015/12/what-is-factory-reset-protection-google-72-hour-lockout-android-lollipop.html Jey Use the new password Lead Poisoner Is it stiĺ 72 hours? Just happenned to my phone sony xperia z3 plus Dickie Whiteside BOOM! Fix for Factory Reset Protection https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuPIhiFZoaI DJ Anderson Honestly, no system is full proof. Thieves will be thieves and I do feel this is overkill. If you don't, this obviously hasn't happened to you yet. This just happened to me without any warning from the system whatsoever. I feel a lawsuit brewing if Google doesn't fix this one size fits all approach to phone thievery. Furthermore, I can't for the life of me figure out why it can't just use your thumb print scan to bypass the lock. Obviously if my thumb is there, it's me. Which brings me back to my point - no system is full proof, and this one is flawed big time. ZULUWA GO TO HELL GOOGLE WITH YOUR FREAKIN ARTIFICIEL INTELLEGENT STUPIDITY. I did a factory reset, I erase the all phone data. I was going crazy.. Even I erase media data. F**** Y plug-Ugly arsemongers. And Thank you Folks with you precious clarification, yesterday I was unable to sleep until morning and I was about throwing the phone on the wall, Appreciate you post. Uzer Account Does it matter if my phone is on or off? Should i turn it on/off in 3 days for it to unlock? Frank Markovich I changed my password to ensure there would be zero issues when I reset my phone....fuck me running. Esther McGough I like the protection, but I hate that no one knew this until I researched it, I could have bought a new phone last Thursday, had my phone number put on it and got my account straightened out then had to wait the three days, instead i was frustrated until today when I did just that, so to get into my phone i still have ANOTHER three days , get this information out to people who sell your phones Randy Deaton Just to add to the discussion but I just bought a used phone and the previous owner factory reset it before sending it...now I have a phone that I literally cannot use because of this feature! If I ever try to log in it wants the "previous" account and I do not have the previous owners information! In my scenario this feature is pretty dumb! Denys Kravchenko Nexus 5x, Android 6.0.1 - not 72, 24 hours now :-) Lead Poisoner I hope its true i need it for my job hrzn well I just got f'd by this on my s7, the damn thing randomly stopped recognizing my finger print after months of it working, I had 2 attempts left, I decided to shut the phone off and turn it back on knowing when I do that it instead asks for me to input a password, which I've done a few other times when restarting my phone, but I guess I forgot the exact password, so both attempts struck out, it shut off, reset, apparently stated it would delete everything now it wants my google account, no problem... except I had my google password set to be remembered on everything, so I haven't actually put that in for several months, I forgot that too, it says "forgot password?" I clicked that, reset it, now it just loops back to putting google account info in again. I can't get past it, is this the 72 hour thing you mention, now I have to wait that long? This is ridiculous. Waste of $700, and I'm gonna be f'ing pissed if my baby daughters photos were deleted. Marcus Silva Almost got locked out, luckily I had 2 accounts guest23 You sir saved me! I was sitting up sulking and whining because I was locked out but I have two accounts! I thank you and my daughter thanks you lol tffk I'm locked out of my brand new OnePlus 3 because of this bullshit. It would have been nice to be warned first! Varun Menon Same. Locked out of my oneplus3. Have a couple of questions, after the 72 hour period, should i factory reset the phone again and then log in with my new pass or not factory reset and just log in? Angelo When does the 72 hour timer start??? Jesus. The most basic question and you never answered it! Is it 72 hours after performing the reset OR 72 hours after changing your password! bo ure Apparently, after changing your password. Mostly likely because IT TOLD YOU TO when you tried to sign back in. (I'll bet $100.00 you entered your email and password, both new and old a million times trying to get your legal phone back in use. Man, I hate Google with the heat of a thousand suns.) Kayla P-P I don't know if anyone is still monitoring these comments, but I have a related problem. I have a brand new S6 edge. My son was telling me I needed security on my phone, so we were trying to set up the fingerprint scanner. The scanner would NOT read my fingerprint, so we did NOT set up a backup password, and I NEVER enabled the fingerprint security. I did set up a four digit pin for the swipe screen. A day later I REMOVED the swipe screen pin because I was trying to move stuff to my phone via USB and I had to keep typing in the PIN. When I removed it, the phone did NOT ask me for my fingerprint or pin. The same day, I updated to 6.0.1. Then, I tried to go back and put a PIN on the swipe screen (which, after the update, I did not have anymore! When I wake up the phone it goes directly to the home screen). I cannot even ADD security to my phone because it is asking me for my fingerprint (which the scanner never took) or backup password (which I never set). I am resigned to a factory reset, but am worried about the Google lockout. In anticipation of the reset, I removed 2 factor authentication from my Google account. Will THAT start the 72 hour clock, like resetting the password would? I am not locked out of my phone, so I can use it...just wondering if I need to wait a few more days before attempting the reset. I have read that a lot of people have problems with getting back into their phone after reset with Google...I don't know if that's just because so many people have changed their password, or if there is a glitch with the phone software. That worries me more than the factory reset itself! In my googling about this problem, I found this too: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McQbcCHN3b0 Andreas Hello, very good article. But I want to tell you now, I had reset my mobile phone, I was waiting 3 days, I had put my details, and didn't work, then I had changed my google account password, and I was trying again, it didn't work, I was called Google Support, they had told me to wait 72 hours and to try again. I was waiting 4 days today, I was trying again, and I can't log in. What should I do?! ([email protected] ) Simone Ramella Thanks for the useful information. I only wish I read this post two hours ago, before factory resetting my wife’s Motorola Moto G as suggested by our phone company (she has been unable to receive any call in the last few days and they were unable to give us any help). Of course, she did not remember her Google account password, therefore I had to change it right before factory resetting the phone. Now I found out that for at least 72 hours (why not a couple of months?!) she won’t be able to use her mobile phone at all. Which is not really a joke if you don’t have a spare one to replace it (we don’t) and need it for your work and/or to keep in touch with your children, and not just to play Pokemon Go. It seems Google cares a lot about our security, but doesn’t care at all about warning its users that they may be locked out for at least three days from their own phones if they dare to change their Google account password. They can call it “security”, for me it’s just total nonsense. PANDAMONIUM🚀 God damn it, now if only I had known this 20 minutes ago. Also, I read that the lockout is for 24 hour snow, instead of 72, is this correct? bo ure I HATE this phone more than anything I've ever purchased. Samsung Galaxy S6 through Sprint. It's been hours and hours and hours and hours and untold piled up hours of straight up heartache, grief, and pure aggravation, reading and researching, and so precious little use. WORST purchase of my entire life. And now I'm not even having the service I pay a fortune for each month. And now it will undoubtedly cost more $ to pay somebody to bypass. And this is what happens when three giant corporations are all involved in a matter so simple as a phone. And I thought Apple was obnoxious. The 3-way marriage between Google, Samsung and Sprint beat them by a mile. Never again. When my contract is up, this is the last. Heba Reda Attar I have a question.. when the 72 hours are finished, and i try to log in again with my new password it will log me in? or i have to log in with my old passwords? Alexander Baron Just for the record, I think this article should clarify that the phone is now only locked for a 24-hour period. I recently spoke with a Google Support representative after my phone was locked Nuala Ronan yes, the notification on my oneplus 3 is 24 hours. i wish we could authenticate another way similar to banking recovery. even 24 hours is ridiculous Kyrstol Dinger Do you have a phone number for google support? I have been doing this dance with the 24-hour wait even though my password hasnt been changed for the last 4 days!!! Cara Huggett Seriously, where can I address a complaint letter? I was forced to factory reset my s7 because it kept freezing and shutting off on its own. In the process of setting my phone back up I had to sign into my gmail. Well the the problem is that I have been signed into my gmail account automatically on my phone for over a year and I don't remember my password. I had to reset my gmail password online so I can sign in and set my phone back up. Now I am locked out for trying to set my phone back up? Brilliant really! There must be a better option than this. CT So if my phone keeps saying verify your account I have to wait 72 hours and then what?? Nuala Ronan i have changed my google password 3 times since i got my phone and i cannot remember the original password i registered with. Google does not keep a listing of archived passwords. Does this mean i am permanently locked out out my phone if i cant remember my original password? Laura Covarrubias It is a very helpful and detailed information, thanks. I have a question that I hope you can help me with. I did the reset on my phone without Changing the password; I simply forgot the password and after several attempts I thought the reset was the option to go, however when I tried to set up the phone again. It did not et me to connect to wifi because the phone was unauthorized reset. Does not say anything about waiting 72 hours or gives any other option. Do you know what can I do? Thank you Xchris This should also include updating your version of android. I have to wait 24 bloody hours to use MY phone. Absolute fuckers. Why the hell can't they tell you this before the update begins. I'm furious Thomas Let me get this straight: - I own the phone - I have my new Google account password - I still remember my old Google account password and yet Google arbitrarily decides to ban me from using my phone, without providing any way to prove my identity? That's insane. On top of that, no information is given about this ban, neither on the log screen, nor in my Google dashboard. I am buying a non-Android phone first thing tomorrow morning. TCH Apple? I''m not sure if Apple has something similar? It's going ok, I just feel victim to Google as well and have to wait 72 stinking hours. No warning no nothing, had I known I would've changed my password earlier than do the factory reset. Glenn Beaumont So google tells me a foreign computer has logged into my google account whats the first two things I do??? Change my password (of course) and then reset my phone. I DO THIS FOR SECURITY - and then I get locked out. A warning would have been nice because I would have done it in the other order (reset my phone first and then changed my password) to avoid this. It's very annoying and has convinced not to buy google crap anymore. Dennis Zisman Great time to find this out! At least it is only 24 hours now, GD stupid, not making this a known fact until - Hey I'm locked out! Tren Dix When does the 72 hours lockout start?...is it everytime I Hard reset or factory reset the phone?...so when I do that it also resets the 72 hours?...it is already pass 72 hours since I made the 1st hard reset...but before that...not knowing about this problem...I have multiple hard reset my device...im using a nexus 6...it was my dads...so I dont a problem in google account...please help thanks... Kevin Really pissed about this. Here is the kicker, it will let you reset your password for google (then obviously locks you out of your phone). Which, if this account is your master for all of your google domains, if the person who supposedly stole your phone knows your email address or phone number, boom, they now have access to your google account, all of your domains, and can basically wreak havoc to web pages, etc. Google basically put my business on hold for 24 hours and revealed a hole in their security. If a competitor wants to bring me down, all they have to do is get my phone, repeatedly enter a bad password, force a factory reset, reset my google password, log on to google domains, and then proceed to bring down my domains. Way to go google. idiots. I am getting rid of my android phone and migrating my domains to godaddy or someone else. Intrepiddreamer Probably too late to post this but just in case someone happens to read this article - you can get your phone unlocked by samsung. I went through this today and waited the 24hours and got back in but when i spoke to a samsung rep they mentioned that you could go to a samsung verified service centre with your proof of purchase and photo ID (maybe credit info just in case) and they could unlock your phone for you! It won't void any warranty and is what samsung would recommend - so always keep your phone receipt it's how you can prove you own the phone! Hopefully this help! lulaberri My phone was not working and I was unable to use the keyboard. I have a password on it so basically, the only thing to do was factory reset. Now I am stuck without a phone. This is not good google. I also send the pw recovery to a different phone. and i vaildate through my email, yet still it doesnt do anything. what thief is going to go through all this trouble to get your emails and google account really?

The Korea Herald > World Google’s AlphaGo retires on top after humbling world No. 1   Published : 2017-05-28 14:17 Updated : 2017-05-28 14:17 SHANGHAI -- The Google-owned computer algorithm AlphaGo is retiring from playing humans in the ancient Chinese game of Go after roundly defeating the world’s top player this week, its developer said Saturday. AlphaGo defeated brash 19-year-old world number one Ke Jie of China on Saturday to sweep a three-game series that was closely watched as a measure of how far artificial intelligence has come. AlphaGo last year become the first computer programme to beat an elite player in a full Go match, and its successes have been hailed as groundbreaking due to the game’s complexity. This file photo taken on May 25, 2017 shows China`s 19-year-old Go player Ke Jie preparing to make a move during the second match against Google`s artificial intelligence programme AlphaGo in Wuzhen, eastern China`s Zhejiang province. (AFP-Yonhap) Go has an incomputable number of moves, putting a premium on human-like “intuition” and strategy. But this week’s contests in the eastern Chinese city of Wuzhen were its last, said DeepMind Technologies, the London-based AI company that developed AlphaGo and which Google acquired in 2014. In a blog post, DeepMind founder Demis Hassabis said AlphaGo’s developers will turn to “the next set of grand challenges, developing advanced general algorithms that could one day help scientists as they tackle some of our most complex problems.” These could include “finding new cures for diseases, dramatically reducing energy consumption, or inventing revolutionary new materials,” he said. “If AI systems prove they are able to unearth significant new knowledge and strategies in these domains too, the breakthroughs could be truly remarkable. We can’t wait to see what comes next.” Go involves two players laying black and white stones on a grid, trying to capture the most territory. Invented nearly 3,000 years ago in China, it is played worldwide but most popular in East Asia. Top players have been mesmerised by AlphaGo, describing its play as groundbreaking and opening up new ways of approaching the game. Likewise, AlphaGo’s feats have fueled visions of AI that can not only perform pre-programmed tasks, but help humanity look at complex scientific, technical and medical mysteries in new ways. AlphaGo’s “thinking” is powered by millions of connections similar to neurons in the brain. It is partly self-taught, having played millions of games against itself. This week’s matches received considerable build-up in China, where it is popular. But Chinese authorities abruptly banned live coverage before the first match on Tuesday, prompting anger and scorn on Chinese social media. The ban was not explained, but quickly fueled speculation that it was linked to Google‘s tense history with Beijing. Google shut down its website in 2010 in a row over cyberattacks and Chinese censorship, and most of its offerings have remained blocked by authorities.

Drucken URL 28.05.2017 Von Peter Stelzel-Morawietz Whatsapp, Mail-Checker, Radio, Übersetzer, Passwörter oder das Wetter sind ein paar Beispiele für praktische Browser-Erweiterungen. PC-WELT stellt Plugins für Chrome, Firefox und Opera vor und zeigt, was Edge künftig kann. Empfehlen Diskutieren Drucken PDF URL Xing LinkedIn Twitter Google+ Facebook Webbrowser oder allgemein auch Browser sind spezielle Computerprogramme zur Darstellung von Webseiten im World Wide Web. So lautet die Begriffsdefinition auf der deutschsprachigen Wikipedia-Seite. Diese ursprüngliche Funktion erledigen die Browser natürlich immer noch, aber eben auch sehr viel mehr. Wie weit man das Browser-zentrierte Konzept treiben kann, demonstriert Google mit seinen vor allem in den USA beliebten Chromebooks . Auf diesen Notebooks mit dem Betriebssystem Chrome OS läuft als einzige Anwendung der Browser, alle weiteren Funktionen erfolgen im Web oder als Erweiterung. Und um genau solche Add-ons geht es im folgenden Artikel, in dem wir Ihnen die besten Browser-Erweiterungen am Windows-PC vorstellen. Anhand von zwei Beispielen möchten wir demonstrieren, wie praktisch die Zusatzprogramme für den Browser sind. Nehmen wir als Erstes den Quasi-Standard-Messenger Whatsapp auf dem Smartphone, und nehmen wir weiterhin an, jemand schreibt Ihnen und fragt Sie etwas, das ein wenig ausführlicher erklärt werden sollte. Auf der Bildschirmtastatur Ihres Smartphones wäre das Antworten recht mühsam, ein erläuternder Anruf vielleicht gerade unpassend. Also bleibt das Beantworten am PC, was dank Browser-Erweiterung und Tippen auf der PC-Tastatur eine Kleinigkeit ist. Ähnlich verhält es sich bei den zahlreichen Download-Helfern für Videoplattformen wie Youtube und Co., denn mit der passenden Extension landet der gestreamte Clip schnell auf der Festplatte. Nun ist Browser allerdings nicht gleich Browser, in Bezug auf die Erweiterungen gilt dies noch einmal mehr. Gerade Microsoft wollte mit seinem neuen Edge vieles besser machen und wirbt im Webstore, den man im Browser über "Erweiterungen -> Erweiterungen aus dem Store abrufen" aufruft, selbstbewusst mit "Optimiere Deinen Browser! Hol Dir diese nützlichen Erweiterungen, die speziell für Microsoft Edge entwickelt wurden." Das Angebot ist jedoch mehr als ernüchternd, nur ein gutes Dutzend lässt sich zum Zeitpunkt dieses Artikels installieren. Verglichen mit jeweils Tausenden von Add-ons für Chrome, Firefox und Opera ist das praktisch nichts. Damit haben wir die mit Abstand wichtigsten Browser bereits genannt. Chrome liegt hierzulande mittlerweile deutlich vor Firefox und der wiederum vor Safari. Weil der Apple-Browser aber besonders auf Rechnern mit Mac-OS Verwendung findet und die Erweiterungen nicht in der Windows-Version funktionieren, gehen wir nicht weiter auf Safari ein. Eine Art Geheimtipp stellt dagegen der in Deutschland nur im Ein-Prozent-Bereich verbreitete Opera dar. Denn zum einen ist der Browser aus Norwegen vergleichsweise schnell und bietet seit Kurzem außerdem sicheres VPN ohne Daten-oder Geschwindigkeitsbegrenzung. Zum anderen lässt sich der Funktionsumfang nicht nur mit fast 2000 Erweiterungen aus dem Opera-eigenen Webstore vergrößern, sondern mit einem Trick zusätzlich um die des Google-Browsers (mehr dazu im Kasten). Opera mit Chrome-Erweiterungen Dass Opera ein ausgezeichneter Browser ist, haben wir eingangs bereits begründet. Erweiterungen lassen sich zum einen über die offizielle Opera Add-on -Seite laden. Wir zeigen Ihnen aber auch, wie Sie die unzähligen Chrome-Add-ons im Opera-Browser nutzen. Installieren Sie Opera auf Ihrem Rechner und rufen Sie anschließend die Webseite mit den offiziellen Erweiterungen auf. Die zur Verfügung stehenden Einträge lassen sich hier wie bei Google und Mozilla gezielt heraussuchen, nach Bewertungen filtern oder durch Stöbern in den Rubriken finden. An die Chrome-Erweiterungen kommen Sie nun mit folgendem Trick: Im gerade geöffneten Opera-Webstore suchen Sie das Add-on „Download Chrome Extension“ und installieren es anschließend über die Schaltfläche „+ Zu Opera hinzufügen“. Öffnen Sie dann im Opera-Browser den Chrome-Webstore aufrufen, links die „Erweiterungen“ markieren und dort einen Eintrag auswählen, erkennt der Installationsserver Opera quasi als Chrome. Ein Klick auf „+ Hinzufügen“ installiert die Erweiterung, allerdings müssen Sie sie in den Erweiterungen mit zweimaligem Klick auf „Installieren“ noch aktivieren, weil sie aus einer vermeintlich unsicheren Quelle stammt und eben nicht aus dem Webstore von Opera. Wichtig: Der Trick funktioniert nur bei den echten Erweiterungen, nicht dagegen bei den Apps aus dem Chrome-Webstore. Der einfache Weg zu Ihren individuell besten Erweiterungen Kaum der Erwähnung wert: Auch Monate nach dem Start des neuen Microsoft-Browsers in Windows 10 stehen kaum Erweiterungen für Edge zur Verfügung. Foto: IDG Vielleicht nutzen Sie Whatsapp gar nicht und wollen auch keine Webvideos speichern! Keine Sorge, bei mehr als 10 000 Erweiterungen für Chrome und Firefox ist garantiert auch für Sie etwas dabei. Alle verfügbaren Hilfsprogramme finden Sie im Webstore des jeweiligen Browsers: Für Google Chrome hier , für Mozilla Firefox hier und für Opera hier . Alle drei Webstores sind ähnlich aufgebaut, Ihre persönlichen Favoriten können Sie dann aus dem anfangs schier unübersichtlichen Angebot auf ganz verschiedene Art und Weise heraussuchen. Da ist zunächst einmal die Freitextsuche. Wenn Sie beispielsweise oft online bei Amazon einkaufen, installieren Sie einfach eine passende Erweiterung für diesen Shop. Genauso gehen Sie beim Musikplayer Spotify, bei der Fernhilfe Teamviewer, beim Onlinespeicher Dropbox sowie bei allem anderen vor, was Sie konkret nutzen. Hilfreich sind des Weiteren die Kategorien, in die die Add-ons thematisch eingruppiert sind: Datenschutz, Sicherheit und Suchwerkzeuge sind nur drei Beispielrubriken. Weil die Auswahl teilweise auch darin noch gewaltig ist, orientieren Sie sich einfach an der Beliebtheit, also an der Anzahl der Downloads und an der Bewertung durch andere Nutzer. Alle Hersteller arbeiten mit einem System von null bis zu fünf Sternen für eine Top-Bewertung. Bei Opera fällt das Stöbern derzeit noch ziemlich schwer, da sich die verschiedenen Filter nicht miteinander kombinieren lassen. Große Hilfen für Kommunikation, Mail und den Büroalltag Pocket heißt zwar nicht mehr wie früher ?Read it later?, der Dienst übernimmt aber noch die gleiche Aufgabe: nämlich das Sammeln von Webinhalten fürs spätere Lesen. Praktisch sind die zahlreichen Mailchecker. Sie zeigen hinter der Adresszeile gleich, ob und wie viele neue Nachrichten Sie haben, ohne dass Sie Ihr Mailprogramm starten oder sich im Webmailer erst anmelden müssten. Diese Add-ons stehen für einzelne Provider wie GMX, Web.de, Gmail, Yahoo oder Microsoft Office 365 zur Verfügung. Es gibt allerdings auch anbieterübergreifende Erweiterungen, zum Beispiel das hervorragende Simple Mail. Bereits erwähnt und für Whatsapp-Nutzer ein Muss ist Whatsapp Desktop. Print Edit und Capture & Print (für Firefox) und Print sowie Print Friendly & PDF helfen dabei, Webinhalte und -seiten vernünftig auszudrucken oder im PDF-Format zu speichern. Bewährt haben sich auch Fireshot (Firefox) und Awesome Screenshot (Chrome, Opera) zum Speichern und Verarbeiten von Webseiteninhalten. Der Evernote Web Clipper vereinfacht die Handhabung des gleichnamigen Notizdienstes. Der Google Translator übersetzt Webseiten aus fremden Sprachen ins Deutsche (oder umgekehrt), Wetterberichte fürs alltägliche Nachsehen gibt es zuhauf. Praktisch ist außerdem die Möglichkeit, Webinhalte zu sammeln und dann später zu lesen: Save to Pocket (früher: Read it later) muss bei Chrome nachinstalliert werden, in Firefox ist Pocket bereits integriert - rechts oben durch ein graues beziehungsweise rotes Icon. Voraussetzung für die Nutzung des Dienstes ist eine Registrierung. Übrigens: Die Sammelfunktion beschränkt sich keineswegs auf Text, sondern umfasst sämtliche Seiteninhalte und Videos. Möchten Sie Texte lieber auf Ihrem E-Book-Reader von Amazon lesen, nutzen Sie die App Push to Kindle oder Send to Kindle. Die Add-ons ePubReader und Readium ermöglichen es in Firefox respektive Chrome, E-Books im Browser am PC zu lesen. Wer oft Begriffe im Online-Lexikon von Wikipedia nachschlägt, der erhält mit der gleichnamigen Erweiterung sofortigen Zugriff. Bing-Google (Firefox) eignet sich für eingefleischte Google-Benutzer, die Erweiterungen leiten selbst von Microsoft fest mit der eigenen Internetsuche verknüpfte Dienste konsequent auf Google um. Sicherheit im Netz, Privatsphäre und Verschlüsselung Lange Zeit äußerst beliebt war die Browser-Erweiterung Web of Trust (WOT). Sie stuft Webseiten als vertrauenswürdig ein, ist aber wegen Datenschutzbedenken nun selbst in die Kritik geraten. Foto: IDG Sicherheit und Internet und damit Sicherheit im Browser gehören unmittelbar zusammen. Viele Jahre war "WOT - sicher surfen", die Erweiterung der Sicherheits-Community Web of Trust, sehr beliebt. Anfang November wurde bekannt, dass WOT ganz offensichtlich Nutzer ausgespäht und Benutzerdaten verkauft hat. Google und Mozilla haben das Add-on daraufhin aus ihren Stores entfernt. Deshalb nutzen Sie besser den McAfee Webadvisor, früher bekannt als McAfee Siteadvisor. Diese Erweiterung zeigt auch auf einen Blick über ein Farbsystem, ob eine Webseite vertrauenswürdig ist oder nicht - und zwar nicht erst, wenn Sie die Webseite aufgerufen haben, sondern bereits in der Trefferliste von Google. Grün heißt gefahrlos, Gelb "Bitte Vorsicht" und Rot warnt ausdrücklich vor möglichen Bedrohungen. Noscript (Firefox) beziehungsweise Noscript Suite Lite (Chrome und Opera) blockieren gefährliche Javascripts, Java-Applets, Flash-so-wie Silverlight-Animationen. Die Freigabe muss manuell erfolgen und gilt nur bis zum Schließen des Browsers, alternativ verwenden Sie eine Positivliste. LastPass verwaltet sicher Ihre Onlinezugänge, und Ghostery weist Sie beim Surfen auf versteckte Dienste hin, die im Hintergrund private Daten an Seitenbetreiber übermitteln, und blockiert diese auf Wunsch. Stealthy erfüllt gleich mehrere Funktionen, unter anderem sorgt das Umleiten über einen Proxy-Server für anonymes Surfen und das Verschleiern der IP-Adresse. Click & Clean löscht den Surfverlauf in Ihrem Browser, wenn Sie diesen schließen. Gelöscht werden außerdem der Cache, Cookies, gespeicherte Formulardaten, Passwörter und einiges mehr. Better Privacy soll vor "Super-Cookies" schützen, steht jedoch lediglich für Firefox zur Verfügung. Wiederum für die drei hier genannten Surftools gibt es HTTPS Everywhere. Damit werden Sie automatisch auf einen verschlüsselten Server desselben Anbieters umgeleitet, sofern ein solcher verfügbar ist und Sie zuerst die unsicherere Variante aufgerufen haben. Mithilfe von Mailvelope schließlich können Sie Ihre E-Mails einfach und sicher "end-to-end" verschlüsseln. Mit Ausnahme von Better Privacy existieren alle der zuletzt genannten Addons in Varianten sowohl für Firefox als auch für Chrome und damit auch für Opera. DownThemAll! DownThemAll! Ist ein genialer Download-Manager für Firefox, der den Download-Vorgang beschleunigt und beste Ordnung in die Downloads bringt. VideoDownloadHelper VideoDownloadHelper erlaubt das bequeme Herunterladen von Youtube-Videos auf die lokale Festplatte. Firebug Firebug fügt Firefox eine Reihe von Web-Entwickler-Tools hinzu, mit denen beispielsweise der Aufruf von CSS-, HTML- und Javascript-Code überwacht werden kann. NoScript Mit der Sicherheits-Erweiterung NoScript lässt sich Javascript für Websites deaktivieren, auch vorübergehend bis zum nächsten Aufruf. FlashGot Mit der Firefox Erweiterung FlashGot binden Sie fast jeden Download-Manager in Firefox ein. Klicken Sie zur Konfiguration nach der Installation mit der rechten Maustaste ins Browser-Fenster und wählen Sie "FlashGot Optionen". Google Translator for Firefox Google Translator for Firefox fügt Firefox einen neuen Kontextmenü-Eintrag hinzu, über den ein aktuell markierter Text schnell und bequem mit Google Translator in die eigene Sprache übersetzt werden kann. <br> Tab Mix Plus Tab Mix Plus erweitert die Tabbed-Browsing-Funktionen von Firefox um Funktionen wie das Duplizieren von Tabs, Kontrolle über das Öffnungsverhalten von Tabs und Fenstern, die Wiederherstellung geschlossener Tabs und vieles mehr. Auto-Sort Bookmarks Das Add-On Auto-Sort Bookmarks ermöglicht eine automatisierte Sortierung der Lesezeichen und bietet noch einige weitere praktische Funktionen, die den Umgang mit Favoriten erleichtern. IE Tab 2 Mittels IE Tab 2 lassen sich Websites innerhalb von Firefox mittels der Internet-Explorer-Engine öffnen. FireFTP FireFTP bietet einen leistungsstarken und sicheren FTP-Client direkt im Browser. Deutsches Wörterbuch Deutsches Wörterbuch (neue Rechtschreibung) fügt Firefox eine Rechtschreibprüfung hinzu, die beispielsweise alle Eingaben in Formularen überprüft. LastPass LastPass ist ein vom Browser unabhängiger und vielseitiger Passwort-Manager mit vielen Extra-Funktionen. So werden beispielsweise auf Wunsch automatisch sichere Passwörter für den Zugang zu einem Dienst generiert und gespeichert. Der Zugang zu allen Passwörtern erfolgt per Master-Passwort. ReminderFox Mit ReminderFox können Sie bequem Ihre Listen mit Erinnerungen und Aufgaben verwalten. Das AddOn erinnert Sie dann direkt im Browser an Ihre Termine. Forecast Weather Das Add-On Forecast Weather blendet in der Statusleiste von Firefox aktuelle Wetterinformationen und eine Wetter-Vorhersage ein. Image Block Mit Image Block können Sie das Laden von Bildern auf Websites verhindern. Dadurch wird das Surfen beschleunigt und die dabei übertragenen Daten reduziert. TinyURL Generator Mit TinyURL Generator kann per Mausklick für einen Link eine Kurz-URL via TinyURL erstellt werden. Außerdem zeigt das Add-On an, wohin eine Tiny-URL führt, wenn man mit dem Mauszeiger über einen solchen Link fährt. FastestFox - Schneller Surfen Surfen Sie schneller durch das Internet, durch die Optimierung gängiger Aufgaben. FastestFox hilft Ihnen nach Informationen zu suchen, in Wikipedia zu stöbern, Ihre Lieblingsseiten zu besuchen, beim Kopieren und Einfügen und vieles mehr. FireShot FireShot ist eine Erweiterung für den Firefox-Browser, die es ermöglicht, direkt aus dem Browser heraus ein Bildschirmfoto der aktuellen Internetseite zu erstellen und auf der Festplatte zu speichern. TV-Fox Mit dem kostenlosen Firefox Plugin TV-FOX erweitern Sie den Browser um eine Fernsehfunktion, mit der Sie gleich mehrere tausend Sender empfangen können. Zotero Mit der Firefox-Erweiterung Zotero lassen sich Zitate, Literaturhinweise und andere Fundstellen im Internet einfach und komfortabel sammeln. McAfee Site Advisor Site Advisor vom Sicherheitsspezialisten McAfee für Firefox- und IE-Explorer hilft Ihnen dabei, sicherer durch das Internet zu surfen. Greasemonkey Ist Greasemonkey unter Firefox installiert, lassen sich Greasemonkey-Scripts in Firefox aufnehmen, indem Sie das Script im Browser öffnen und dann „Extras, Install This User Script“ wählen. AniWeather AniWeather zeigt aktuelle Wetterinfos in Firefox an. Die Darstellung des aktuellen Wetters erfolgt animiert. ColorfulTabs ColorfulTabs färbt die geöffneten Tabs in unterschiedlichen Farben ein und erleichtert es dem Anwender so, den Überblick zu behalten. Download Statusbar Download Statusbar zeigt in der Statusleiste den Stand des aktuellen Downloads an. Angezeigt werden die verbleibende Download-Größe und die noch für den Download benötigte Zeit. FireFTP FireFTP ist ein FTP/SFTP-Client für Firefox. Sie können über FireFTP eine Verbindung zu einem FTP-Verzeichnis erstellen. Unterstützt werden SSL-Verschlüsselung, SFTP, Remote Editing und zahlreiche weitere Funktionen. Flagfox Das Firefox-Add-On Flagfox blendet nach der Installation und dem Neustart des Browsers künftig in der Adresszeile eine Landesflagge an, der der Anwender entnehmen kann, in welchem Land sich der Server der gerade aufgerufenen Website befindet. iMacros Immer wiederkehrende Eingaben können Sie mittels iMacros for Firefox automatisieren. Image Zoom ImageZoom fügt Firefox eine Zoom-Funktion für Bilder hinzu. New Tab King New Tab King ersetzt die langweilige leere Seite, die beim Öffnen eines neuen Tabs standardmäßig angezeigt wird. Stattdessen wird eine vollständig personalisierbare Seite angezeigt, die beispielsweise die kürzlich geschlosssenen Tabs oder die am häufigsten aufgerufenen Websites enthält. Personas Personas sind kostenlose, leicht zu installierende Themes für Firefox, die es leicht machen, das Aussehen von Firefox zu ändern. SpeedDial Beim Öffnen eines neuen Tabs können Sie mit SpeedDial eine Übersicht mit ihren Lieblingswebsites einblenden lassen. Genial: Speed Dial zeigt nicht nur einen Screenshot einer Website auf der Übersichtsseite an, sondern aktualisiert diesen auch auf Wunsch regelmäßig, damit Sie sofort auf der Übersichtsseite erkennen können, ob sich etwas auf der Website getan hat. Außerdem können Sie einen Ausschnitt von der gewünschten Website auswählen, der als Screenshot auf der Übersichtsseite angezeigt und dessen Inhalt ebenfalls regelmäßig aktualisiert werden kann. Ideal also beispielsweise für News-Junkies. Stylish Stylish erlaubt das Anpassen des Aussehens von Websites sowie der Programmoberfläche mit Hilfe eigener CSS-Stile. Web Developer Die Erweiterung Web Developer fügt dem Browser diverse praktische Web-Entwickler-Tools hinzu. FoxTab FoxTab spendiert Firefox eine schicke 3D-Ansicht.

Google Voice updated to 5.2, adds new widgets and call screening [APK Download] Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/23 5:11pm PDTMay 23, 2017 37 Plus 1 on G+ 75 Share on Facebook 63 Share on Twitter Total Shares112 Applications Google News Videos Today Google started rolling out another update to Google Voice, bringing things up to 5.2 The new version of the app brings widgets in three new sizes. It also provides a new setting in the app for the 7-year-old call screening feature. The feature has been around for a while, but you can now enable and disable it via the app. It seems the last few months were no fluke, and Google is committed to keeping Voice updated now that it's been redesigned out of the Holo era.    At first glance, things look the same. The Google Voice app hasn't been redesigned or changed graphically. After all, we did just see a redesign. But, it does have some sweet new features. There are three new widgets and a new option for call screening. The only visual indicator that you'll find in the app of the version change to 5.2 is that new call screening option in the settings menu. You can find it under "Calls," and toggling it enables or disables a pre-call automated message that tells you who is calling, and gives you the option to take the call or ignore it. To be clear, this is the same feature that Google Voice has had for 7 years online, but now we are able to enable and disable it via the app. It is a simple tweak, but a useful one.     There are also the three new widgets, which you can see above and below. The two smaller widgets offer just a couple of options, and the smallest only has one button, which controls which number you call from. You can toggle between four different call modes for Google Voice, and a toast indicator and. These are the same four that were present in previous versions of Google Voice. Namely the ability to set Google Voice for all calls, the SIM for all calls, Google Voice for international calls only, or to ask each time. They might be the same options as before, but now it's much easier to switch between them, as you don't have to open the app every time you might want to change it. The middle-sized widget adds two more buttons. You get a do not disturb mode toggle and a messaging shortcut to the app. Both of the widgets are resizable, and each one turns into the other if you adjust it to meet the other's parameters.    The third widget is the big one, and I have expanded it in the images here past the default size to show things off. It basically brings all the functionality of the app over into your homescreen. You can see missed messages, calls, and voicemails, with a tab at the bottom for each. The same outgoing call and do not disturb toggles are present, though they are larger and include text indicators. You also get the messaging shortcut, and it shows you your Google Voice number in the corner, should you be the forgetful type. The new update started rolling out yesterday, though not everyone seems to have gotten it. I have not, but I was able to install the latest version manually. If you don't see the most recent version on Google Play, feel free to pull it down via APKMirror. Download QR-Code Google Voice Developer: Google Inc.

Jeremy Couch This is all I want to know too! I guess I'll try it and report back. Jeremy Couch It's still missing. I'll restart and check again but doesn't look like good news. Ryne Hager Nah, it is still missing. abqnm First being able to finally f*n type to assistant and, and now this, the second major release for Google Voice, all in one week? I/O time does have some benefits. Carson Saldanha Wait, Voice now works with Assistant?! abqnm No, I don't think so. Maybe. Haven't tried, sorry. But what I was talking about us that you can now type to Google assistant instead of having to use your voice. When it replaced Google Now, it made the home button shortcut that used to allow easy access to searching by text go to Assistant, which was voice only. But Google finally, after many horrible months as fixed this by adding a keyboard popup in Assistant. And then the Voice app gets an update, so I was relating the too because both of these were very long-awaited updates. Though the screen calls one was like a decade old, but it finally came. The keyboard was only 3 months, but it was a considerably more important feature. WitnessG What is that circle icon in the status bar? Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Looks like battery, which is a little redundant. WitnessG Is it part of O or is it a rooted feature cause I think it looks nicer than the regular battery icon. Roh_Mish Nope. Rooted feature. davidofmidnight Now if they would put some effort into accurate transcriptions... Adam Margeson Put some effort into? You should hear the quality of their source material. They've come a *long* way, especially the last couple years. Santos Chavez They have, I've had Google Voice for years and it used to be laughably horrible, but it's vastly improved since then. Even the recent Spanish transcription that was added gets 90% of what was said right. andy_o wth, finally added Spanish? Is it recognized automatically? Santos Chavez Yep, it recognizes it automatically from what I've seen. Haven't explicitly let GV know in any way that someone tends to speak in Spanish when they leave me voicemails, yet it's transcribed them in Spanish anyway, getting about 90% of it right on average. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ I mean, it's certainly better, but I still get some pretty amusing transcriptions every now and then. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ That third blurred out face looks so familiar... Ryne Hager He's just some dick from AP comments. hp-fourtwenty multiple account control!!!!!!!!! Adam Margeson Except they've got it in their terms of use that you only have a single Google voice account. jcopernicus Been there since the last major update, and it's broken if you DONT want an account signed in, as it will randomly try to go through the setup. gvanmeter I hope they fixed photos getting turned sideways after being sent and the lack of 3gppp video support. jcopernicus Still no voip? oh Erick Wright Would be nice if we can make this the default SMS app destinyhud would be nice but then after 2 years google will remove it. so why even bother mama1nana I wonder when Google will allow Google Assistant to send GV sms. keithzg Obligatory "why can't we have this in Canada?" (Hilariously enough, I had a phone number that would have worked for this, but it got taken away by the corrupt right-wing provincial government for hilariously dumb and self-serving reasons years before Google Voice became available.) Justin Bassett Now if only those on Project Fi could use it.... www_LAAG_us Sounds like everyone has same complaints I do. C'mon google make some substantive changes. Im tired of little silly stuff and window dressing..oh wait thats right google engineers do what they want to do not what users want. sorry Jeffrey Linton Thanks Ryne for the info. MattBoan I'm still waiting for them to unify Voice and Hangouts. Well. Mostly just the VoIP feature that for some reason is allowed on Hangouts, but not the friggin' official Google Voice app. They've been saying it is "coming soon" for months if not years now. www_LAAG_us Amen to that sam1331 "Your suffering waiting on Google will not go unnoticed, and will be rewarded in the next life!" - A recovering 6-year Google Voice user I don't know why Google is putting more focus on Google Voice these days, but I suspect it will still be treated as a second class citizen as it always has, with its users always hoping Google will smile upon them and finally make it awesome. It's always one update away... Nexus✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Still no outgoing calls from the app (voip) forced to use carrier minutes to place calls. On iOS you have been able to for quite a while. Means on Android the hangouts dialer and hangouts stats installed. Sigh. destinyhud well u have hangouts dialer to make voip calls using google voice number. so u r not without an option. I am waiting for them to add that feature to google voice and then i will uninstall hangout dialer rap I've been getting more frustrated with Google Voice lately. It takes forever to connect and now about half the time, the call doesn't go through and I have to try a second time or use my sim card # which confuses people. I'm trying to figure out if it is related to my phone being connected to a wifi that requires a sign in (like a public wifi) or maybe just a week wifi. Po Lite My guess is you have shotty internet at those times. I hope this was fixed in this version 5.2 but ever since 5.0 was released Google Voice requires internet to make phone calls if you don't believe me try it. Turn off WiFi and Mobile Data reboot phone and you will not be able to make a call with Google Voice. Then go to APK Mirror and download any 4.x version and do the same thing and it works every time. I tried to convert to the new google voice and give up on hangouts but I go to areas where cell is ok but 3G and LTE are bad and Google Voice 5.x will fail on dialing. So I changed back to Google Voice 4.x and works like a charm. So now I am back on Google Voice version 0.4.7.10 and Hangouts for SMS. oh well hope it gets fixed. BTW this problem exists on three different phones 1 AT&T and 2 T-Mobile. rap I got an email with a helpful reply from Po Lite but I don't see it showing up here. It sounded like exactly the problem I am having. I will sum up what it said: Since version 5.0, internet access (wifi or mobile data) is required to make a GV call. Po Lite had this same problem and reverted back to GV version 0.4.7.10 so could make calls where have cell reception but no data. andy_o Google Voice calling always required internet only for the first call to any number. After that, all subsequent calls to that particular number won't require it. atc-tech Nice! The call screening thing is one of the features I was really missing from the app! I like the new app and I have been using it for SMS every since it came out. It's better than Allo because I can use it across multiple devices (tablet, phone, work phone) and it has an web client version on the website! What I really wish I could do now is use Google Assistant to send SMS via Google Voice with no workaround or "ghost" numbers. Also, VOIP calling from within the app. xyz Still US-only. Still don't give a fuck about voice.

It recently tossed up a little holiday sale on movies and TV shows over on Google Play, including some deals that are over 50% off their regular prices. So if you can't go camping or throw that family barbecue because of rain, at least you and your loved ones can snuggle up inside while you binge watch The Wire. It'll be good for little Johnny's character. Among the better movie collections being offered are The Lord of the Rings Trilogy for $20, the Back to the Future Trilogy for $15, and "The Best of Tarantino" six-movie collection for $30. The latter includes one of my favorite cheesy horror movies, From Dusk Till Dawn. The TV selection has a lot of solid HBO shows — if you don't happen to have HBO Go — as well as the complete X-Files for $50, American Horror Story seasons 1-5 for $60 and the amazing Kung Fu series in its entirety for $30. For more family-oriented deals there are a ton of shows from Nickelodeon, as well as a small number of animated children's film collections. You know what? The outdoors are over-rated. Who would want to spend a weekend outside with their loving family when they could spend days forcing their children to appreciate their favorite childhood movies. Let's face it, in the long run, your kids will thank you. Source: Google Play (1, 2) Tags deal alert google play memorial day movies sale tv subscribe ...

And it made me wonder what else would change, if we kept watching. Would Google keep adding detail? And would Apple, like Google, also start making changes? So I wrote a script that takes monthly screenshots of Google and Apple Maps.1 And thirteen months later, we now have a year’s worth of images. The screenshot comparisons in his post perfectly demonstrate Google's iteration and Apple's relative stagnation. Speaking from personal experience, Google Maps has considerably improved in my area in the past year, while Apple Maps has remained essentially the same. Which isn't to say that Apple Maps is bad – Google simply has an edge over local business information and they're evolving at a faster pace than Apple. To me, Apple Maps looks and feels nicer; Google Maps seems smarter and it has modern features I'd like Apple to add. I wonder what Apple has in store for WWDC and if they should consider separating Maps from their monolithic software release cycle in the summer. (See also: O'Beirne in May and June 2016.)

Google will help the union train 500 staffers and 40 trainers, who will then go on to teach 10,000 farmers through offline sessions. This activity is expected to benefit another 20,000 farmers through online training programmes. The nine provinces include Lai Châu, Bắc Giang, Nam Định, Nghệ An, Lâm Đồng, Bình Phước, Đồng Tháp, Tiền Giang and Bạc Liêu. The company believes that IT can help solve some of the greatest and most complex challenges, including improving economic efficiency in agricultural production, Google’s representative said, adding that it would make a difference to a sector threatened by urbanisation and climate change. Nitin Gajria, Google’s country manager for Việt Nam, said the company hopes farmers will be able to improve cultivation and farming techniques, increase productivity, and access useful information in their daily lives through the internet. Lại Xuân Môn, chairman of Việt Nam Farmers’ Union, appreciated Google’s support and said the initiative is practical and meaningful. It will contribute towards accelerating the use of scientific and advanced technology in agricultural production and business, and help in the agricultural sector restructuring, Môn added.

Google family groups make it easy to share photos, calendars, Keep, YouTube TV, and more Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/05/23 12:06pm PDTMay 23, 2017 89 Plus 1 on G+ 96 Share on Facebook 49 Share on Twitter Total Shares234 Google News Google has added a number of family-oriented features in recent years, and now it's bringing it all together under "family groups." This feature plugs into family sharing for YouTube TV, Google Play Family Library, and adds easy family sharing to a few other Google services. Setting up a family group is easy, but there are a few restrictions. To set up a family group, just head to the Google family page. You might already have a family set up if you've used YouTube TV of Google Play Family Library. If not, you can create and manage one from there. Google Keep and Photos are included by default, but nothing is shared automatically. These services simply get a handy link to share notes or photos with all members of the family group. Some setup is required for Google Play Family Library, Play Music family plans, YouTube TV, Google Calendar, and Family Link. The page has links to all those. Families can have as many as six members (including you), and you can only be in one Google family group at a time. Make sure you know what you're getting into before joining someone's family group—you can only change your family group membership once every 12 months. Note, family features for Google Calendar, Google Keep, and Google Photos are only available in Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Russia, Spain, United Kingdom, and the United States.

It'll probably get support in half a year or so (speculating) if at all. Justin Osborne Doubtful. They haven't added Play Family Sharing... so I can't share movies/music/apps/etc with my wife. Justin Osborne For shame, Google, for shame. Super annoying. ktrain I am struggling to understand why Google should feel any need to make this available to G Suite customers. This is a consumer feature. I get that some families with tech saavy folks use G Suite to: Manage people shouldn't have been on Google in the first place because of To spy on your kids emails Because you want to help out someone who is seriously tech challenge. This is probably .001% of all the paid G Suite licenses. Google's G Suite PMs have way hotter topics for enterprise clients, IE whitelisting/blacklisting OAuth apps, expanding DLP functionality in Mail/Drive and launching Google Chat. Justin Osborne Because I've had Google Apps for over 10 years. When I joined if I had known what I know now, sure, I'd have used another Google account. You can just go back now, after you have 10+ years of data on your account! Anthrox G Suite has a different set of requirements for business software that is built for uptime over features. im hoping over time they will allow for domain on families. maybe also move free g suite accounts over to families accounts will see where they go with this there is still a lot of integration going on DarenTx Yes. This. Let me migrate my G Suite accounts to Family Groups without losing my stuff or changing my login. BinaryTB Google Play Music family plan Google Play Family Library Google Fi Giving Google $$ for G Suite, but not allowed to give them more for the above. Thanks Google. Stephen Cornwell It's for families. G-Suite is for businesses. DarenTx But when I signed up for G Suite it wasn't just for businesses. Now that the marketing of these accounts has changed give me a way to migrate to Google Family Groups. Chris It was originally marketed as being great for families. So My entire family is on G Suites. But we can't share apps through the family sharing, we can't share a Google Play Music family plan, we can't share Google TV accounts as advertised. The Music and TV are both something that I'm more than happy to pay for, but can't so I use competing services now. That alone is $50/month from me that Google isn't getting. Not to mention, the Google Home that I bought was sent back because it doesn't support my account. And at this point, I can't migrate my family back to standard Google accounts because all of our purchases are tied to these G Suite accounts. Google needs to get their shit together on this issue. mondeca Is the Calendar feature new? I clicked on the link, and it just took me to the usual Calendar view. I didn't see anything about Family groups. Something to roll out soon? James Doyle It said it added a new Calendar to your view called "Family". It did for me when I signed up. Everyone in the family group can see (and presumably edit) the Family calendar. mondeca That makes sense, but I don't have a Family calendar. Jonathan Berry Same for me. I already have a family group from Google Play Music, so I wonder if the creation of the Family calendar is not getting triggered for existing accounts. Mimi Same problem here. Hoping the family calendar for existing customers gets rolled out soon, or that we at least get the option of having one added. Quint’s Sharking & Seashells Same here. I have a family group for they play store, but I don't see an option for the family calendar. Must not have rolled out to all yet. SVem26 Fantastic.. A few things to make this better MANAGEMENT -- Centralized app/Page to manage everything Family related ( The family Link app that was recently released is a good place or in the Google settings app) DRIVE -- Family settings for Drive storage.. e.g. Sharing the upgraded storage quota with the family group MUSIC -- Ability to share uploaded music with the whole family in Play Music MAPS -- Option of Location sharing for entire family (opt-in) FIND MY DEVICE -- Option to track locations of all devices of all members (opt-in) Other possible enhancements -- Group communication through Allo,Duo as a readily available option, Shared Wallet balance,etc Anthon Williamson If it would let me have access to their Chrome Remote Desktop. Opt-in of course. Then it would be the only tool I need for personal remote access. Everything else we be business use. SVem26 Ah yes.. Great idea.. I am waiting for the Remote desktop to be updated to support Android devices as host.. Would be a great help with my parents.. I use inkwire currently.. works but I still have to yell and tell them what to do.. -Matoro Zeliph- Yeah. It looks half baked so far. My mom is a noob when it comes to computers. So having this will help Paul_Werner Also, the Shared Family Payment Method should allow you to require purchase approvals for people above 18 too. Just because I want to add in a family member doesn't mean I want to allow them to make all the purchases they want using my card. Because of this my "family" is only my wife and under 18 daughter Sir_Brizz Bananas that this isn't already taken care of. It was the primary reason I haven't created a family group.

I'm not seeing it on my account. Navarr Barnier > You can only set up a family group with a personal Google Account, not a G Suite account makapav This is just another skunk-work half-brained idea to come out of someone's free time that will wither away without real-world use-cases just like the other Google Family Plan/Program that was launched a couple of months ago. Of course, this will not tie into the Google WiFi family settings controls and descriptions, or managing other Google accounts or God-forbid the grocery list that Google Home creates in the Google Express app. This whole thing was created to meet some random guy's dilemma. All this while, Google Photos does not recognize the groups you have already created in your Contacts app when choosing a target to share pictures. Anthrox give it some time today is the first lunch of software outside of play and play music. software is complex you have many different teams with different goals the family support might be coming after other feature they need to do first makapav Humbug excuses. Just like how after 7 years of phone launches, it's still a difficult problem to solve. Or 15 messaging apps later... Yuri Vidal US Only... =( Kunal God dammit Google! A person can be part of more than one family! Take, for instance, people that are married. Honestly, it's like Googlers are robots and overlook simple logic. JD Woo the Nexus 5 is making a comeback and this time in white.

A product called “Google Attribution” was unveiled at a marketing conference this month in San Francisco by the internet giant. Google has long been able to determine when users click on an ads and make a purchase, but linking online and offline habits takes its analytics a step further. Google senior vice president Sridhar Ramaswamy, who announced that Attribution is in test mode with a limited number of partners and will be rolled out to more advertisers in coming weeks, touted the tool as being able to answer the long-challenging question of whether marketing campaigns are working. “Google Attribution makes it possible for every marketer to measure the impact of their marketing across devices and across channels,” Ramaswamy said. “Data-driven attribution uses machine learning to determine how much credit to assign to each step in the consumer journey — from the first time they engage with your brand for early research down to the final click before purchase.” Real-world customer email addresses or loyalty plan information can be woven with Google data from services such as AdWords, Google Analytics and DoubleClick Search to provide “a complete view” of marketing performance, according to the company. Using artificial intelligence, or machine learning, to better analyse and understand consumer behaviour to target ads and promote sales was a major theme of the conference. Ad ‘holy grail’ For several years now, AdWords has enabled advertisers to measure visits to real-world stores stemming from online campaigns, Ramaswamy noted. “Still, measuring store visits is just one part of the equation,” Ramaswamy said. “You also need insights into how your online ads drive sales for your business.” Real-world transactions matched back to Google ads are handed in “a secure and privacy-safe way,” with store sales information reported in aggregated and anonymised forms to protect individual privacy, according to the company. Tying online activity to offline shopping decisions has been a “holy grail” for advertisers for quite some time, and comes with worrisome privacy implications, according to ACLU senior policy analyst Jay Stanley. Attribution threatens to intrude on a core tenant of privacy, that people can have dealings with one party not spill over into affairs with other parties they interact with, Stanley contended. “This is an evolution, not a revolution; another step toward increased monitoring of individuals,” Stanley said. “Each step raises the question ‘Where does this all stop?’” Stanley expected Google to be on its best behaviour when it came to handling the growing trove of information about users, but that even the best of intentions could crack under the “enormous hydraulic pressure of the profit motive.” “We have the full fury and genius of the capitalist system being driven toward monitoring people in ever increasing detail and companies are competing to do so,” Stanley said “It will not stop without some sort of rules in which we as a society express our values through legal protections.” More tempting ads? Google and Facebook dominate the online ad world, and what one does to prove its worth to advertisers is likely to be copied by the other, according to Silicon Valley analyst Rob Enderle of Enderle Group. Attribution promised to give Google a way to assure advertisers they are getting their money’s worth at the firm’s online venues. “The big problem is that showing conversion from ad consumption to purchase has been horrible,” Enderle said of online marketing. “This has been a problem for a long time. Google is trying to make a metric so they get credit for it when you do purchase after viewing an ad.” Data showing which ads are translating into real sales should mean that the relevance of ads people see online will improve as marketers abandon mis-aimed or ineffectively tailored messages, the analyst reasoned. “You are going to be hit with ads for things that you might actually want to buy, so you are going to spend a lot more money,” Enderle predicted. Worries about privacy sparked by linking offline and online activities are a decade or so late, because the time to protest was when collection began of the troves of data about people, the analyst argued. “There really is no downside to this application,” Enderle said while discussing Google’s marketing metrics move. “This is the good side of collecting data; it is what else is being done with the data that should be unnerving and that we really don’t know.” — AFP                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Google linking online and offline worlds in new ad challenge Upcoming video games: ‘Star Trek’ VR, ‘Tokyo 42,’ ‘Tekken 7,’ ‘Dirt 4,’ ‘Wipeout Collection’ Eager shoppers throng newly-opened Apple Orchard Road Singapore’s road safety campaign takes a VR twist Britain's real-life 'Iron Man' has high hopes for jet suit (VIDEO) Report: Facebook leaked documents show types of content it allows Free carpooling app for Singapore mosque-goers in time for Ramadan You won’t believe how easy it is to fool Samsung Galaxy S8’s ‘eye security’ Samsung investigating Galaxy S8 ‘iris hack’ Samsung to reveal stretchable display Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: One Direction's Styles tops Billboard with solo album Reuters Video: 'We hit a home run,' says Trump on foreign trip Reuters Video: Wenger says Cup triumph has no bearing on his future Reuters Video: Cast and crew of ‘The Beguiled’ discuss the remake Reuters Video: Thai man murders baby, commits suicide on Facebook Live Tilda Swinton unveils strange ‘Okja’ promo clip Related Articles Google and partners try to block the march of ad-blockers Machine learning may fix ad placement dispute, says Google Johnson & Johnson, JPMorgan suspend YouTube ads over offensive videos (VIDEO) AT&T, Verizon join Google ad boycott Google apologises to ad clients for YouTube content fiasco Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | recommend.my - Local Services

We were warned by Google about it months ago when Hangouts started showing a warning that it would no longer support the feature. But, as of today, it's finally set to happen. For anyone who isn't on Project Fi or Google Voice — both of which will continue to support SMS in Hangouts — this is the end of an era. Many people, myself included, made the final push into Hangouts over other services when SMS support was added. The integrated conversations made it much easier to keep short communications together in one place. So far there's no word on if SMS support will be coming to Allo. Now that Hangouts support for SMS is finally over, we aren't really left with a clear migration method. Anyone that might have made use of it will have to either deal with using two separate apps again or move over to a new service. If you are looking for recommendations, Google's stock Android Messages isn't so bad. But, if you've been enjoying having SMS and chats merged, that isn't really a solution. Allo is always an option. But, that's the same issue from the other side, you'd still need to find a way to send SMS messages. There's always Facebook Messenger or Signal, which both provide a combined SMS and chat solution. Each has its disadvantages, though.  The latter doesn't have quite the same feature set that Hangouts did, and the former is a Facebook product. Either way, it's closing time. You might have just enough left to send one last SMS before the lights are shut off. If you still plan on using Hangouts for chats going forward, make sure you've updated to the latest version of over at Google Play or APKMirror. Download QR-Code Hangouts Developer: Google Inc.

Even if we all got left out to dr-WHY GOOGLE, WHY?! JVF When referring to people it is always "Hanged", sounds funny but that's just how it is. It's a past participle. Ryne Hager Yup, I know. That was the joke. Jason E Perkins Yup. The past participle form of "hang out" is definitely "hung out." "Hanged" only means "suspended" or "put to death by hanging." JVF I'm well aware of that. 4Ui812 I understand what you're saying and I debated the proper way to put it..... I have to stand by hanged. xyz Hung Lo? instinct I am like 6 different active group chats in Hangouts. Good_Ole_Pinocchio Google doesn't care about you. humulos A truer statement has never been said Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2c9aad5a41d09ce24c4c4e04e7b3a28a2004487ff015df2fc519b5c2a9556024.gif Adrien Aubel Google's messaging strategy is now: - Android Messages for carriers & OEMs - meaning strictly SMS/RCS - Allo for their new consumer messaging service, and the focus of their upcoming work - Hangouts for business/enterprise Nothing personal :) humulos How innocent we once were, at the time when we witnessed Talk, Voice, SMS and G+ Messages become a single product, fulfilling all our dreams. Undone in naught but a few years, with this final limb being ripped from the body. But I guess I'm on Project Fi, so I'm good for now. My parents weren't happy about this news, since our family communicates primarily on large Hangouts threads. mxwp but if they are using actual Hangouts IM threads and not SMS they can still use Hangouts Shannon Butler Home-based mummy Kelly Richards from New York after quitting from her fulltime occupation has able to make from $26000 to $28000 on a monthly basis from freelancing in the house... This is just one way she successfully done it >>> learn by clicking here how to do it right now humulos For sure, and they still do. They just don't like having to use multiple apps for messaging. Adrien Aubel IMHO those big plans haven't been followed by strict coding/design rules, and Hangouts became progressively a technical mess, then a true nightmare for anybody to work on, with the UI becoming slower with each version, fortunately partly compensated by faster phones. To be fair, SMS/MMS can be very complicated to deal with, and Android development was much harder and potentially messy when Babel has been developed, the technologies available nowadays would have helped a lot. So down the road it would have been neither productive or future-proof to keep iterating all efforts inside Hangouts, at least without a total recode from the ground up. Right now I wonder if they will indeed clean the code up to remove all carrier SMS/MMS, and eventually speed up the app and make it smaller, or just roughly disable it. t_newt If Hangouts became a technical mess, the solution isn't to drop Hangouts, it's to fix Hangouts. They could have made it a framework for their products that any of their messengers could be installed into. Instead they are trying to make it an enterprise Slack competitor. What company is going to trust their company to Google's leftovers? "SMS/MMS can be very complicated to deal with". Apparently this is true at Google. Duder12 They aren't getting the left overs. They are getting two brand new products. Hangouts Meet and Hangouts Chat. OhYeah! 2 products solving a problem that the last hangouts solved already in one app. Great nigra truo Well, that is why we use whatsapp, does a lot more and is just one application and while Americans are backwards in Whatsapp use, it is the world wide defacto standard, many people that use Whatsapp have not written a SMS in year and I know that for me it is a pain in the ass, because it is of lousy reliabilty, often you don't know if the person received the message, much less if they have read it, you can't record voice memos of unlimited length, can't voice call or video call them and it is not encrypted ( functions that whatsapp supports natively) Here is a little comparison of SMS vs Whatsapp: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1StygzfbH0eSg7gwCgPUdpenzDeTbsuwKk3dMiG-BGQY/edit?usp=sharing It is not hard to see that it will replace SMS, as it already has for 1 billion people. pfmiller SMS can be complicated to deal with, but it's not dealt with by Hangouts. The OS handles SMS itself and then gives whichever SMS app you select access to the SMS message database. Adrien Aubel If you mean that the app doesn't have to interact directly with the radio, you're right. But the APIs provided for SMS/MMS by Google are nonetheless very tricky to integrate beautifully with. For example, the ContentProvider could be so much cleaner to interact with, and some OEMs like Samsung crash on non-simple queries. Another example is that most apps ship their own MMS logic, usually based on Google's own sources ( https://android.googlesource.com/platform/packages/services/Mms/+/master/ ), in case the carrier or OEM customized the system MMS logic and made it not work properly with apps other than their own, or if the system isn't configured correctly, and let the user the option to switch between this logic ("Legacy") and their system when it comes to send MMS. We could expect better from an OS serving 2B active users, but I'm glad it's at least open to 3rd party apps, unlike iOS. JG Personally, rather than spinning Allo off as its own new app, I would have preferred Google to treat it as the next major update to Hangouts. Have the team re-work the app from the ground up, streamlining the code, etc. If I'm not mistaking, around that time, Facebook and Shazam were launching their own reworked Lite app versions designed to use less bandwidth, storage and resources. Reworking Hangouts would have followed suite. Essentially, Google could have made their first Go ready app a year or so early. Hangouts already has a large username, and it has all of the features users have been asking for - cross device/platform and SMS support. And I don't think the is any issue with SMS being a challenge to implement as they have their own SMS app, Android Messages which send to work well enough to be the default app to push RCS. It shouldn't be too hard to fold it (and the Assistant) into Hangouts while streamlining it. My name is…. Nobody ever used Hangouts for SMS outside America. Actually, nobidy uses SMS no more. There DOES exist a world outside America, you know, and its much bigger!! sproc Haha, you wish. Everyone I know is stuck on sms. They try whatsapp and stuff then abandon it. Adrien Aubel Especially iOS users, who already have a great "Messages" app that outsmarts SMS when possible. For them it doesn't make too much sense to download another messaging app every now and then. Rodrigo Gomes da Silva So.. where are you from? Jay No you wish, but you must be in the states. No one i know uses SMS anymore. It's an archaic dead service, only used for bank transaction notifications and amazon deliveries. Everyone else is either on whatsapp (yes 220 million of us in this country and growing at 4 million a month) or (wechat which is like what 85-90 percent of China) No one cares for SMS. xyz And where do you live? America. We already know. TheDrunkenClam What an unnecessarily smug and nagging comment. Winston Well it's true, even if it's smug. Outside the US, SMS is pretty much dead as we've all moved towards WhatsApp, as carriers still don't give unlimited texts by default. I think it's time to start asking another company for SMS integration. Christopher Gannon That would work if so many people in the US weren't using iMessage, where the only way a non-apple user can chat is via SMS. Then apple makes it very difficult NOT to use it, so good luck convincing your friends to give up siri, etc. I'd also like a solution, like hangouts or iMessage, where messages aren't restricted to a phone, and I can seamlessly use both on my laptop, tablet or phone.

Ryan No, the purchasing power of the average American is still in the top 10%. 90% of this country doesnt know what poverty looks like in the rest of the world. Magister Good for them. I live in us and everyone uses sms, so that's what I use. What everyone else uses is moot. Michael Sørensen Nonsense. I'm not in the US (Europe) and the VAST majority in my country still use SMS. Alejandro And how do you send voice clips through SMS? Good luck with that runamonk Why the fuck are you sending voice clips? Just call them for fucks sake lol. Jesus you kids these days. IT'S A PHONE. Adrien Aubel At invi we observed that a significant amount of our users rely heavily on push to talk and voice typing. We want to improve it so that when you pick up the phone and put it on your ear it plays any unread message to make it more lightweight, as well as an auto-transcribe, but it's already pretty useful when you and your contact are used to it. When you're biking, on your way to the office, cooking, cute messages to your SO, ideas (that you can send to yourself as well), ... You can let your recipient get to your message whenever (s)he wants rather than requiring his/her availability right here and then. That being said, we'll bring soon WebRTC video calls / possible Duo integration to get face-to-face in one tap, and we expect this to indeed take over and reduce the microphone features usage. nigra truo Hahaha, you look silly defending a deficiency, voice memos are super useful, especially when driving or if somebodie's on a call. Used by many not stuck on sms. runamonk I'm not defending anything, sms is old and very long in the tooth. It should have been removed years ago. Andrew MMS handles voice clips just fine in my experience. dblock Easy, if your SMS app supports this (mine does), you can send voice clips as an attachment like any other MMS message. nigra truo Wow, the man is still using the archaic technology that is mms. Hahaha! I have not sent one like that since 2011, when i discovered whatsapp. Adrien Aubel I don't know if that's exactly what you meant, but on invi ( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi ) you have push to talk, voice typing, and ability to share audio externally from any app (depending on the format and your carrier we may host it ourselves and send a link FYI). It's not just yet open outside of USA but I can eventually give you an APK if you can't wait to try it out, lmk! Tomáš Petrík Free for everyone, you say? Not here... And yes, I am in the EU. nigra truo Sms is over in europe, don't know where you are from, but you might want to be less backward and start using whatsapp like a billion other people, sms is archaic and it Can't do so many things that whatsapp can, which is already the defacto international IM standard, even on iphones, as it supports all the platforms. Michael Sørensen Scandinavia. And no one uses WhatsApp. Maybe backwards, but it works, and I still haven't seen a compelling argument for changing... Josh Brown outside america and use it everyday. Jason Hirsch I was very annoyed at having to add Hangouts as my SMS client. I couldn't keep separate separate anymore. Now in combination with Fi, GV, 2 phones and obi it's a nightmare. On this overseas trip i couldn't force Fi to dial via WiFi. So i had to go back and install Hangouts dialer. If they (Google) have a master plan there's no rhyme or reason to it. Nick I'm not sure what the future holds for us Fi users, but it's looking grim. My family and work is in the same boat it seems. I have been promoting Hangouts for a long time since it could handle everything I needed plus some, now as our services split out communications start to waver... All I can hope for now is they at least follow through with their promises to allo and add desktop support. (Status: Soon ™) atc-tech Google Voice users should still be able to use it too, I think? I don't know. I switched the the updated GV app when it came out around the same time the hangouts DEintegration was announced, so I'm not sure, but I think Voice users still can... Aaron Berlin Who knows what the plan is long-term for GVoice in Hangouts, but the actual GVoice app is actually good now. No equivalent to the chrome extension/desktop app, though. Ryne Hager You are right, Google Voice users can also continue to receive SMS messages in the app, I'll make that more clear. atc-tech Cool. I wasn't sure GV still could, but I thought I remembered hearing that we could. I gave up already though and use the prettier new GV app... Wish they would add back more features though. Ryne Hager The new app is so pretty. I do wish my GV voicemails would show up in my call logs again, though. atc-tech Yes! Along with the options for do not disturb mode. mxwp i exclusively use my GVoice number for calls and texts and use it on Hangouts. the update GVoice app has an annoying bug in that it tries to connect every account on your phone instead of just your main one. i have submitted it as a bug but have not heard anything back Tom Harman So when does Allo officially get SMS support, lol. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Same time it gets tablet support: Never. rndusrnm479461 Am I the only one who doesn't understand what's so good about SMS integration in either Allo or Hangouts? Is it really hard for you people to use 2 apps? Jesus christ. Google's "Android Messages" is lightweight anyway, why is it such a problem to use it? It shouldn't even eat much RAM. Kyle Gospodnetich Yes, yes you are. Please never work for Google, or really any company that has a hand in communications. My name is…. No, he is not Kyle Gospodnetich Congrats, now there's two of you idiots. iluvthesoftsoft One do-it-all app > two apps Adrien Aubel Let me know what you think about invi, https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi, we're trying to fix texting on Android and provide transparent switch between SMS&IM (devices handshake when you get into chats so that we determine whether you or the recipient has poor reception and should prefer SMS for example). MJ Two apps? One app for SMS and than Facebook, WhatsApp, Allo/Hangouts, and whatever to cover all my contacts. SMS is the only thing I can message 100% of my contacts with. Adrien Aubel Google's messaging strategy is now: - Android Messages for carriers & OEMs - meaning strictly SMS/RCS - Allo for their new consumer messaging service, and the focus of their upcoming work - Hangouts for business/enterprise They can't risk to upset carrier and OEMs by implementing non-carrier features in Android Messages / the default SMS app they provide. Or at least it's a risk they're not ready to take at that time. Btw I wouldn't say "Android Messages" is that lightweight btw, notably on modern devices it could be so much smoother :( sam1331 I don't get it either. When Android Messages came out I switched my SMS over to it. I quickly realized I was using it almost exclusively for 2 factor verification codes. But really, the notifications all go to the same place, I already have to decide whether to use Hangouts or Facebook Messenger when talking to basically anyone anyway. I also think people should push a little harder to move conversations over from SMS to something else, I've never found that to be very difficult. mxwp SMS is convenient because you know it will work with any American with a cell phone... including "dumb" flip phones. And it actually is really difficult to get people to switch to another service. Apple users just use imessage to send their SMS to me. And then I send them my glorious green bubbles and those ishills can suck it. YaKillaCJ Sms integration is important because it is supported by 100% of telecommunications service providers and integrated on all devices that can make a phone call and has a screen. You can even sms a home phone without a screen depending on carrier/service provider. Thus it messaging that works with 100% of your contacts. Having multiple Apps spread across 100s of contacts is plain annoying. So if any App wants to be taken serious, it needs to be serious and have sms. What's App already fills the void for bypassing sms across the globe. rndusrnm479461 This answer makes the most sense. Thanks. Adrien Aubel Let me know what you think about invi! play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi We're still new and young but we're very serious about our ambitions and not settling when we know it could/should be better. To fix texting on Android, we provide transparent switch between SMS&IM (devices handshake when you get into chats so that we determine whether you or the recipient has poor reception and should prefer SMS for example). Very handy in some countries/areas/events. And lets you reach *anybody* (that has a phone number). My name is…. Nobody uses SMS no more, and if i wanna send a text message to the last of the Mohicans, i will use my SMS app. I dont want no stupid integration and no stupid 'SMS fallback' that will make things worse. Chatting is not texting. YaKillaCJ There are only 2 widely used methods of messaging across mobile devices. Sms and What's App. Sms is supported on EVERY device from 2 way pagers and flip phones to house phones and smartphones. Any device that has a phone number supports sms. The majority of people doesn't care about added features like stickers and gif. We just care that all I need is the person phone number and from there I can call or text them. That's it. Bottom line is that it has to be a standard adopted by carriers on a worldwide scale. Hence what's app reason for such large scale use is it uses existing phone numbers for login, existing phone book for contact list, free, minimum data usage and encrypted. Even that is still not even used by a third of the devices that use sms. Ryuuie Last I checked, WhatsApp charged $1 or someshit. erptastic It has not done that officially for years. And even before that, they always just extended my account. Ryuuie Ah. Looks like it was recent and official as of last January but they dropped it. It was an annual $1 fee to use the app. disqus_Xz3y8OiO3O It's free YaKillaCJ Who actually pays that. I don't recall anyone ever paying. Besides, it's only $1 a year and that significantly cheaper than carriers who don't have unlimited sms charge. nigra truo The majority of people don't care about features? Go check the market share of whatsapp, you are misinformed. The majority does care and only hillbillies still use flip phones. ;-) YaKillaCJ Features are nice but seamless compatibility is more important. Btw last I recall, less than half of mobile phones in use are smartphones worldwide. Using What's App doesn't allow me to message 100% of my contacts, SMS does. Bottomline. nigra truo You can't send SMS internationally, the plans are very expensive. That is why Whatsapp got so incredible successful. Also, you have to remember that we are not talking about third world nations, which don't even have phones at all or have no good mobile networks, and in all others, Whatsapp has taken over and will be the new standard in the US too, once some people stop resisting it and try it out. I have a large group of people here in the USA with which I'm in contact daily, over Whatsapp and I'm doing communication that can't be done with SMS and would need another 5 apps to accomplish (which many people of course have not installed) nigra truo Sms has endless limitations that is making it useless compated to something as full featured as whatsapp, i found it easier to convince my backwards US friends to use whatsapp, as this will be the universal standard anyway, 1 billion users gives you a hint. YaKillaCJ I do agree that the standard needs to move forward. What I'm saying is that it would have to be a standard adopted by carriers & service providers worldwide. Until then, any App that wants to be taken serious and get use needs to fall back on the current standard. What's App billion users is small compared to the billions in use that support SMS. USA alone has 500million numbers that support sms and that just 1 country. nigra truo Nope, the US does not have 500 million SMS capable phones, that is wishful thinking, of 325 Million people, they would have to use two phones all the time, not to speak that 325 million you have to subtract babies and very old people that are not texting anyone. Whatsapp IS the standard, you can install it on any current phone, no matter who produced it, flip phones are the small minority now and since Whatsapp is free, unlike SMS (phone providers STILL charge you for it, either in a flat fee or individually), it makes it much more attractive to many. I have had the experience when I use SMS, people get offended when I send them a SMS just because they might be on a cheap plan and using a flip phone and each SMS costs them 30 cents and they ask me to please stop. This is not what you would call a barrier free system. Also, some plans have limits of how many you can send or receive and SMS is such a dumb and obsolete technology that it can only send 160 characters in one message and has to string several ones together. Sadly, no phone provider has invented anything useful in the last 20 years, SMS is ancient and the next technology that they tried to replace SMS with fell flat on its face. Companies in this respect know much more what customers want and can make it much more affordable or, in the case of Whatsapp, free. It was invented to avoid (international) ripoff by phone companies and be able to keep contact with your friends abroad without having to shell out 1 dollar per SMS. Sadly, the phone providers are the most technologically incompetent companies out there, it took a company like Apple to reinvent the smartphone, because the phone providers, which this is a core business are were too dumb to pull it off ;-) mxwp in the larger scheme of things, I agree with you that it is not a big deal. still, having one app do both was convenient. the other complaint is Android fanboys being envious of iMessage, which Hangouts could have become. exadeci The main reason that people use Imessage is that you get rich messaging capabilities out of the box if the person you are talking to has an Iphone everything is abstracted, you add someone's number and you start chatting right aways no need to exchange accounts id's or find which app you both use. And if the other doesn't have an Iphone you can still message them or if you killed your data plan it sends an sms. But Google doesn't add sms support because they are pushing for RCS which is a GOOD thing: Standalone Messaging 1-to-1 Chat Group Chat File Transfer Content Sharing Social Presence Information IP Voice call Best Effort Video call Geolocation Exchange Audio Messaging Network based blacklist Capability Exchange based on Presence or SIP OPTIONS All this WITHOUT using any data, data needs an link to be established this doesn't. Chris Hannan It's not hard for most of us to use it. The problem is the people we contact don't want to use separate apps. Everyone with iPhones uses iMessage because it just works by default. But barely anybody I know uses Hangouts and nobody I know uses Allo. If it was all built into one app that shipped with Android phones, more people would use it. Troy Leonard and I removed Hangouts as of today I will no longer consider using any google messaging service ever again Sruly J Isn't Gmail a form of messaging? (Or do you not use Gmail?) Troy Leonard Not for long I'm transitioning over to outlook.com. And upgrading my phone to an iPhone. I'm sick of slow to no updates on my phone,and done with Google ruining everything I ever liked about their apps and Android. naysayer Good riddance. Adrien Aubel Let me know what you think about invi (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi), a new app that we're making that brings a lot of the goodies iMessage brings to iOS users, with big long-term ambitions, and still trying to preserve a consistent and sleek UI. Hopefully that will make you stick to Android and you'll make your iPhone friends jealous in a few months/years ;) Zsolt V Why bother evangilizing? He already decided Outlook on an iPhone is better than Gmail, so let him enjoy it. Troy Leonard Your link is broken Adrien Aubel Fixed thanks! Disqus didn't like the closing ')' at the end of the link. XgudwilX eww outloook😲 Total Insecurity Saying "upgrading my phone to an iPhone" is the same as converting from atheism to any religion. Just a downgrade. bekifft It's true, and their failings and obvious ulterior motives in messaging have, for the first time in a decade, made me consider moving my email back to a private service over which I have control. Roy Thank you and have a nice flight. -Matoro Zeliph- Just want to make sure I'm not missing anything. So Google Voice SMS will no longer work too? Corbin Davenport That will still work as well. Ryne Hager Google voice will still work, just like Fi. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ It's primarily that regular SMS will no longer function in the app. A while back they killed of threading of SMS/MMS and Hangout messages, and now they are killing SMS/MMS entirely out of the app and suggestin people to switch to Android Messages. -Matoro Zeliph- Ok cool! I'm good then. Thanks for the clarification everyone Bill Blandford Hangouts SMS looks like it still works for Google Voice SMS too. Essentially, this is like Fi, which is a Google Voice number at heart. My wifi-only-device kids use Hangouts to call and text with a Google Voice #. Timmy Turner Yeah GV will continue to work through Hangouts since the number you use via Project-Fi is a GV given number. Adrien Aubel For people that were still using Hangouts and want to try a new app that also does SMS & IM, that tries to provide a fast & polished experience to fix texting on Android, I'd love some honest feedback! https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi We're trying hard to "make it right" and have so much planned on the roadmap, so any feedback is great to have to tweak things up. Let us know what you think! exadeci While the initiative is nice, why would we use your messaging app? If I want an instant message app that does sms and that no one else uses I already got Signal and at least Signal is proven to be secure. What makes Messenger (Facebook), WhatsApp and Imessage good? Their userbase. Ask anyone for a way to communicate and they will use one of those apps, no need for fallback sms when everyone has an account. Adrien Aubel Thanks for your feedback @exadeci:disqus! Great questions :) And Signal is nice as well! It's not for everybody but if you're happy with it keep using it but make sure to check us out in a few months to check that you haven't been missing out, we're going fast! I think there's much more to iMessage that makes it good than their userbase. It is a polished app that just works, and lets you reach anybody, therefore becoming your trusted "go to" texting app. We expect Google to release this summer new capabilities that will let you use IM in more scenarios. Very interesting stuff that we can't wait to let our users benefit from. But our initial target is actually SMS users, people that unlike you and I don't really care about the details, they just want a reliable app that sends and receive their messages. And they're actually quite happy with SMS/MMS in that regard, it just works (when you don't fight with APNs, something we try to prevent as well). We want to transparently "upgrade" those users that may be using Android Messages or a 3rd party app custom-made for the carrier or OEM, not necessarily developed with great care and polishment, and sometimes truly terrible (really, you wouldn't believe what's on some popular carriers, that most users end up using 10 times a day for years). Right now invi is mostly upgrading the transport of your messages and general experience as we develop another big focus of ours: bring your chats to life, try to get out of this 99% of messages exchanged being plain text. Texting can be the most impersonal way of communication and this flattens relationships. A bar suggests as you type relevant media to enrich in 1 tap your message and our users send 12% of their messages with stickers, GIFs, or regular images. Which helps you transmit how you truly felt when writing this message, it doesn't flatten as much your emotions (although we're far from done, it'll get much smarter and more personal on a per-chat basis). It always send instantly over IM as well (no upload or anything like that, optimized WebP images for super-fast download). Open your top 3 chats on Signal, chats that you have with people you care the most about, look at all this flat plain texting, and try to visualize the gap compared to what it could be, how it could have been more personal and transmitting more of your feelings or emotions. We're targeting this gap, and again, we're just getting started but have serious ambitions and motivation. If you use Snapchat, look at all that rich media that gets thrown to your eyes or that you throw to people, that doesn't always make sense and is often disconnected from conversations, sometimes losing its value and feeling like you just threw a bottle in the ocean, just leaving you with a list of who saw it. We're looking at that gap as well, as invi becomes more and more rich in terms of content creation. After a few iterations over a couple of years we believe that we found a solution that will let us bring up our roadmap in a consistent structure. State-of-the-art technology that is although just the foundation for all the exciting stuff that we want to add in the coming months. We are in talks with some OEMs and resellers to make invi default which would help grow invi's user base and help us improve our product with more diverse usage, while some upcoming features of invi should ultimately help us get a lot more users naturally. exadeci Signal has actually Gifs from Giphy, stickers and the possibility to send a location but I don't use this kind of feature even on Messenger it's quite rare that I send a sticker. Google is strongly pushing for RCS adoption which would add all these emotions sharing: https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/Rogers_Google_RCS.gif https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/Telenor_6P_GIF_0UHHQdI.gif https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/RCS_Android_Update.width-600.png Adrien Aubel Exactly, but how relevant is Giphy? Again don't compare with things you've seen so far but with what it could potentially be if it truly understood your relationships and intentions, if it combined that with your taste and the way you usually communicate with this specific person. And what if your friends or other people were able to add their own media and stickers through channels and then be discovered, liked and followed, with deep intelligence powering it all and bringing the right content to the right user? We built invi to support all this, we don't just use a Giphy API, we used the most advanced and lightweight technologies to communicate in realtime with our backend, even on pretty bad 3G, from where we curate the media that eventually gets recommended to you. The screenshots you attached look great as well, but see Android Messages is a good example there's only 5 packs of stickers that won't get more relevant or smarter no matter how many stickers you use or how many times you use Android Messages. Idk who would use a given sticker hundreds of times, but anyway I'm not sure those were really representative of how Android Messages is most commonly used. The features are technically there, as often, but they're very limited in their potential as of now. The Awesome Bar isn't for everyone but can eventually help people like you, as images just get displayed while you're typing, no action required, and if you see one that you like you can just tap it to see how it looks and enrich your message, send and you're done. Google is pushing RCS, very true! And we're excited about the great work the Jibe team did in the past couple years. They're a bit shy to share their RCS client implementation at the moment, it may be unstable or not well documented at the moment, but we're meeting regularly with Google and hope to add RCS to our transparent switch as soon as possible, even though the user base is a bit limited at the moment it has the potential to grow fast and solve many issues. If they're reluctant for too long we may use other hubs that would communicate seamlessly through Unified Profile. But for now, we're watching the number of users actually benefiting from RCS grow while we focus on other areas of improvements. sam1331 I am actually kind of optimistic about all this, more so than I was maybe a year ago. They've been putting out a steady stream or improvements to Allo, and when I've experimented with it with a friend it actually is an enjoyable experience. Releasing it without a web app is just shocking, but if that's added and it works well, I could totally see moving over to it from Hangouts, where I do the vast majority of my communicating. The other piece of the puzzle is Duo. If they can integrate a Duo button in Allo conversations (like it seems they will), and they eventually add group calling, which can't be that far off, then I think it will be a nice solution for myself and my family. And I've got quite a few friends that are all about Android instead of iOS, so I can see them switching to Allo from Hangouts. But not until there is a web app, because they aren't stupid. Chad Knasinski I would use Allo if they added SMS support and a desktop version like Hangouts had. Nick.Trite Same here. I have Fi so I'll continue to use Hangouts for SMS. I really love the fact that I can switch seamlessly from desktop to mobile and still be sending SMS. Until Allo does that, I won't consider moving. Chad Knasinski Ditto Sir_Brizz And multi-device support. Can't even use it or sync it on my LTE Tablet... Carson Saldanha So, basically Hangouts but revamped? We've come in full-circle. Sir_Brizz Sure. The problem is that every other chat platform has these features in 2016. Including Hangouts. Roy Me to, love it. mxwp unless they remove hangouts from gmail, people will still secretly be using "hangouts" all the time. in fact, the only way Allo will ever take off without SMS is if it replaces Hangouts (gtalk) on gmail and inbox. Chad Knasinski So correct me if I am wrong here but Google wants us to do this with our messages: SMS - Google Messenger Business SMS - Hangouts Messages - Allo Facebook - Messenger Video Chat - Duo Business Video Chat - Hangouts Video Really? Are you kidding me here? Timmy Turner You've got it right and if there's a joke, you'll being waiting a while for the punchline. disqus_em5YfkbWdk What Business SMS and how is 8t different from other SMS? Zsolt V What does Facebook have to do with anything you wrote? So you are corrected. SpadeX Are you new to tech world? John Not exactly. SMS - Messenger SMS (Project Fi and Voice) - Hangouts SMS (Voice) - Voice Chat - Allo Chat - Hangouts Video chat - Duo Video chat - Hangouts Voice call - Hangouts Voice call (Voice) - Voice Nicholas Conrad Email - Gmail Business Email - G Suite SMS - Google Messenger Business SMS - Hangouts Messages - Allo Facebook - Google+ Video Chat - Duo Business Video Chat - Hangouts Meet Phone calls - Google Voice/Project Fi/Google Home FIFY xyz That's only for Google fanboys. Regular people ditched Google's messaging apps a long time ago. Timmy Turner I recommend Textra to anyone looking for a new SMS app. Sleek, customizable and continually updated/supported. Adrien Aubel Textra is very nice, notably customization-wise as you said, you can go deep and fine-tune basically any UX element. And it's super fast and lightweight as well. I am working as well on a new SMS app that also provides IM similarly to iMessage on iPhone, and many other features, most of them upcoming though. Would you mind giving me a honest feedback when you have the time? It's called invi on the Play Store https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi Timmy Turner Sure thing. freshprince_87 That invi SMS app is an awesome app. Near flawless app. but I stop using it because I kept having problems with MMS messages and also it just like Allo in the sense where if you uninstall the app and reinstall it on the same phone all your instant messages are all gone including some of the regular SMS /MMS messages. You need to make the app save all your messages on to an account like a Google account in the cloud. So that no matter what device you use the instant messages will still be there. Adrien Aubel @freshprince_87:disqus Thank you for your feedback! MMS can be very tricky and every carrier has its own set of specificities, I'm sorry about that, it shows we're still young but obviously like you said, such a core functionality bug makes our whole effort worthless for you here. Do you mind sharing your carrier, device model, and Android version? Did you try using "Legacy MMS" in the app settings? About the IM sync, that's an issue we're definitely looking into, considering all potential security and privacy issues, notably as some countries like USA recycle pretty aggressively your phone numbers, and with the desire to bring a Web client in mind. Google should announce this summer APIs that will eventually help us regarding security, so stay tuned :) freshprince_87 Thanks. I didn't use the legacy MMS. I hope that you add the IM sync soon. I'm on a T-Mobile service using the Moto Z Play on Android Nougat 7.0 Adrien Aubel Ok thank you, if you don't mind I have other questions to dive into your problem :) What specifically was failing? MMS sending, receiving, or both? Did it show an error? Is it only on group MMS or all MMS? Whatever information you may have will be helpful. Our next release should bring MMS reliability improvements and notably Wifi texting when supported by the carrier (first MMS may send up to 60s to send as we're trying out routes but then all other Wifi MMS should send very fast). Tom Westrick https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5ecvBaqHBk MJ Thank God I use Project Fi otherwise this would suck big time for me. TJ Mills Thank God I have Google voice.... Def Ref Actually, it sucks for Fi users who wish to economize on data because Hangouts no longer uses cellular SMS but requires a data connection, wifi or cell data. I didn't realize this was happening (because they said Fi wasn't going to be affected) until I got my replacement Nexus 6P and suddenly wasn't receiving SMS texts. They couldn't sort it out, even sending me a new SIM which didn't work either. It wasn't until I really started digging that I discovered that SMS required data to work and you'd either have to use a different SMS app (and lose multi-device sync; esp ability to type on computer thru Gmail) or turn on data. Lame. MJ OK... I am on WiFi most of the day myself but even with no WiFi it's still texting. Confused, you don't have data on Project Fi? Def Ref I keep my mobile data turned off unless I need traffic info for navigation or need to be in contact with someone via FB Messenger. Otherwise between home, work, Xfinity hotspots, etc., I'm usually not far from wifi. I don't care if I can't get my email for a half-hour while I'm driving. When you're paying per MB, you start noticing how much data apps guzzle. But last month I only used 85MB, so my next bill will be just over $24 with tax. Point is that before they killed SMS support, I didn't need to have data turned on to receive texts. Now I do. MJ I just don't see how you would guzzle data if usually on WiFi. I leave data on and use less than a GB a month. Granted, I don't check my email on my phone ever. LOL Dracono Love hangouts never used SMS. It also seems most negative reviews about it being slow was always tired to the SMS feature. I'm now curious with the removal of they'll us the opportunity to evolve or let it idle. mxwp it will evolve into a business app... but hopefully still available for consumers VAVAMk_2 Just give us SMS support in Allo for Christ's sake! Adrien Aubel SMS/MMS can be quite hard to deal with technically and Google didn't choose to go that way. It is possibly also due to the push they did to replace the default SMS app on many OEMs and carriers, strategically it's hard for them to push much of Google's agenda through the SMS app they give carriers, and they're mostly limited to SMS/RCS. Roy Christ will not give you SMS, bat Star of David could promise you RCS in Allo. mxwp Big G repeatedly stated it would never happen tim242 Liar. Adrien Aubel https://twitter.com/amitfulay/status/840236304130428928 Roy Great. It's was the plan all along. Now Allow will get RCS and web browser everything gonna integrate with Duo. I'm all the way in. I never like Hangout. I love Allo. #stop stop babies don't you cry. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman I don't think that's possible. RCS is still mainly just an extension of SMS. If it doesn't support SMS, I don't see it handling RCS. Roy When RCS will come it will be with SMS already. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Based on what? Besnik Rrustemi No problem guys,we have like 69 other Messaging Apps by Google to choose from and maybe 2 new others coming soon. Roy Haha it's so old. Can someone can come with new jokes here? Besnik Rrustemi Well sorry Old Man then, never knew your age before. * Respect for Old People * Sir_Brizz Let the confusion officially begin! Indianajonze google can go fk themselves Robert Gerhart Why isn't anybody asking the bigger question: why the hell does anyone use outdated SMS in the first place? It's like complaining that Hangouts doesn't integrate butter churns and wagon wheels either. There is nothing more annoying than a text message. Adrien Aubel SMS is always nice to have in some situations, that happen more or less depending on where you live. Uncovered areas, concerts or big games, people having no LTE-enabled plans, or simply on some roads and highways. In USA for example all those scenarios happen a lot, notably in some states. And eventually, in most countries you still use SMS for 3rd party services, banks, transportation, or even government-related messages. Most importantly, in countries that still use SMS you can reach *anybody you know* from one app. And that's really a great thing to have. Now you're right, IM is so much more pleasant. Instant delivery, read status, last active time, way faster image format and transport. At invi ( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi ) we try to take advantage of this and combine both the way it should be. When you open a chat with somebody, we trigger a handshake to check that both you and the recipient are well connected. If one of both doesn't answer on time, it simply switches to SMS/MMS, it's automatic and out of your way. Otherwise you take advantage of state-of-the-art transport with some unique optimizations. Try to send a GIF over IM and see how fast it goes, compared to MMS or even Whatsapp. Let me know what you think! Aaron Simple; SMS is ubiquitous. Every cellular device in operation can send and receive SMS, from the most current and expensive flagships like the iPhone and Galaxy, to the cheapest budget devices, all the way down to the oldest flip phones. I can text my dad on his flip, my wife on her Nexus or my Capt on his iPhone and each one will receive that message and reply. Show me an IM that can do all of that (that isn't on the iPhone). I guess that invi app that guy's been pedaling might, but I'm waiting for it to gain some traction before trying to convince anybody to switch to yet another IM. Rod The rest of the world uses Whatsapp, everyone has it installed. JG Even people with generic flip phones? Rod Nope, but I don't remember the last time I saw someone with a flip phone. The poor now bear Galaxy Win/Pocket/etc JG My aunt still has one. She recently attempted to upgrade to a smartphone but that seems to have failed big time... Apparently my telling her to tap the icon that's labeled "EMAIL" to get her email is too complicated... That and the free phone she got is a PoS... 512MB of RAM and only 4GB of storage - with the OS consuming all but like 100MB there of. So it didn't perform quite so hot. She seemed a bit surprised her free phone didn't perform as well as my Pixel XL does... Rod You're better off simply calling her. Lol JG Or even better off not getting in touch with her period. I also happened to see another flip phone in use while I was out traveling today. TJ Mills Everyone in China uses Wi chat. Rod I believe you meant WeChat. Yes, but WhatsApp still has the largest userbase. TJ Mills Yes, I did mean WeChat. I knew it looked wrong. My point is that not everyone is on WhatsApp in all places in the world. Where SMS is ubiquitous. Rod I have a friend that came from China, and he says most people in China uses WhatsApp as well. It's pretty omnipresent. Aaron And if everyone in the US would get on board with a single IM that would be great. But here iPhone users tend to stick with the stock Messages app. Great for sending iMessages between each other and SMS to the rest of us. Terrible for convincing them to switch to another IM. And most Android users I know use whatever stock SMS message app came with their phone for texting with iPhone users and old people and FB Messenger for IM with everyone in their friends list. So if you have a strategy for getting everyone on a single IM platform I'm sure the Allo team at Google would love to hear it. Jordan L I agree with your post. iphone users LOVE their stock messaging app, as they should it's the best app on their phone. It feels like, at least in my circle, iphone users have the stock messaging app, Facebook Messenger, and Whatsapp. "older" people only have the stock app as they can barely use their phones in the first place. "younger" people all three. Rod Yeah, I know how it works in USA. As a foreigner, it's funny to see how much you guys rely on SMS lol. Aaron Not funny haha but funny sad. :( Rod USA is a world apart. lomsha Believe it or not, even 2g is still a luxury in some countries, which makes​ instant messaging iffy. In those cases sms is a great alternative. Not everyone is in the 1st world with a sweet smartphone and reliable data access. TJ Mills Standard is better than better. When someone comes up with a universal replacement that works on all classes of phones, then the world can switch. Until then it's a mishmash of services and applications​to communicate. Why does everyone still use email? Because of the standards. Michael Sørensen Convince me why I shouldn't... Currently I can write to anyone for free without first asking them what their preferred platform is. And they can reply for free regardless of said preferred platform. Again, convince me why that's not good enough? And don't say "stickers". Just don't. Security? Bah, no sensitive information sent. Robert Gerhart Two words: phone call. Just freaking CALL them... You already have the phone in your hand, and you know they have one as well. If you can condense what you need to say into 144 characters, it probably isn't important enough to bother the other person with in the first place. No more retarded tap-tap-tap... Turb0wned That was a stupid answer. I'm not going to have 15 different messaging apps to be able to talk to people. iMessage just works with everyone. Adrien Aubel Agreed that there's something pretty great about being able to reach *all your friends* from a single app. At least the ones that have a freaking phone numbers :D Of course, it's just how messaging should be but it also makes sense that all big players would heavily restrict any 3rd party integration, messaging is a huge, strategical, market. nigra truo Very good point, sms is over and has been for a long time, it is just that americans are strangely still in love with the ancient spartanic standard, they are backwards compared to the rest of the globe. Whatsapp for example does not support sms because it REPLACES it obviously. Sms can't do rich communication without ugly crutches, try making a free voice or video call through it, send a full size video, high resolution photos, a contact, a document, your location, an audiorecording and everything encrypted. All these things whatsapp can do natively, on all platforms, not just on iphones or apple devices, 1 billion users speak a clear language. Midnitte At this point, I'm held hostage stuck using Hangouts since it's the only thing that natively supports desktop messaging. Sigh. Bryan Chandler Signal has a Chrome app for desktop messaging. https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/signal-private-messenger/bikioccmkafdpakkkcpdbppfkghcmihk?hl=en Midnitte Ah yea, I would prefer something native though, plus I still use Hangouts for some contacts. I lament the loss of merged conversations too Lord Argyris "Each has its disadvantages, though. The latter doesn't have quite the same feature set that Hangouts did, and the former is a Facebook product." It's lines like these that keep.me coming back to AP. JD My support for Google and their messaging platforms ended the beginning of May. Kelly Clubb Well this sucks for any user that enjoyed an easy to use sms app. I use Hangouts and thankfully for project fi will continue it's support BossMa1n3 Eh..doesn't effect me stop using hangout for sms awhile ago..more interested in a flat screen phone with side bezels as thin as the one in the pic.. Grey PLEASE Bring Hangouts Chat and Hangouts Meet to all users. That has so many new and awesome features. It's like everything Allo isn't. DragoCubed The comment section is rough b_boogey_xl Bye Hangouts! hp-fourtwenty oh ffs...voice is still supported??? hell yeah!! nxtiak I'm waiting for the day G+ contacts disappear from Hangouts. I hate how on PC when I type a name to start a conversation it lists random people on G+. SHOW ME THE NAMES FROM MY DAMN CONTACTS GOOGLE!!!!!!!!! Maave RIP Hangouts. I had group chats, Google Voice, and SMS all in one. Now my group chats have moved to Telegram but I'm still stuck with nerfed Hangouts for GV. Chris Wachtman Hey, what's wrong with facebook? /s Gordon Spurgeon Spooner I switched to Signal because of this mess and I've very happy I did---it works great. The only feature I miss is tablet support, but it's coming soon, and unlike Google, when Signal receives a new feature, it's actually ready to be released, and works well. Jason E Perkins Boy am I glad for the second half of that title. ROB TEXTRA DC_Guy If Apple would just open up iMessage to Android, 99% of our messaging problems would be over. haha Dragos Lucian Totally forgot Hangouts existed. I've been using Telegram for quite some time now and I'm more than happy with it. PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ The name of the app is very off-putting if they ever wanted to increase adoption among business/serious users. But as I found out just yesterday, it's actually a really nice SMS apparatus. rap Some say SMS is dead. But not everyone has a smartphone or data. SMS works without either. nigra truo Well, if you have a minimalist phone and plan, you will likely be forced to pay for SMS by the same token. Data is the future, smartphones also, it is just a matter till SMS is gone for good everywhere. The most mentioned point is the point that you have to pay for SMS one way or another, it is never free. Adam Margeson Haven't been using it since I switched over to Allo. 1966CAH When it comes to messaging, Google is like an ex-girlfriend. Once, so sweet and alluring, now somebody I want nothing to do with. johdaxx Well, I hope they can sort this mess out eventually. I don't really care too much about SMS per se...but I do need some way to message people that don't have whatever apps I have or have apps I don't have. Especially if they have the audacity to use an iPhone or something. Brandon Hann This didn't affect me since I use Google Voice exclusively and have a data-only plan for my cell service. Let's just hope Google doesn't kill off Google Voice in the future. keithzg I would say, why remove a feature when you're clearly still supporting it for some users anyways, so it's no more maintenance to just leave it enabled for everyone? I would say that, if I thought there was any coherent or rational approach to messaging strategy and development at Google. Personally I switched to Facebook Messenger for SMS, if only because of Chat Heads (multitasking for IM is pretty nice). Was tempted towards Signal, but Signal wants you to import and encrypt your SMS's, and I don't want to get locked into an SMS app. derp_cookies These guys are starting to remind me more and more of Hooli. xyz Good decision. Next step is to discontinue Hangouts, then Allo, then Messages, and then Duo.

iOS And Switch To Android David Nield May 28, 2017, 10:00am ⋅ Filed to:  android apple fieldguide google ios mobile Share Having guided you through the not-all-that-straightforward process of switching from Android to iOS, we're back to tell you how to go in the opposite direction. (Make your mind up will you?) Going from Apple-powered devices to Google's platform is either ridiculously easy or rather taxing, depending on your current setup. Image: Alex Cranz/Gizmodo Do you Google? Good news if you're already heavily invested in the Google ecosystem on your iPhone. You can switch to Android in an hour or two and keep your evening free for seeing friends or browsing Netflix. Otherwise, better cancel those evening plans. Those of you who spend all your time in Gmail, Google Calendar and Google Maps for iOS can simply install those apps on your brand new Android device, sign in using your Google account credentials, and pick up where you left off. The same applies for Google Photos and Google Drive. Google Drive can handle contacts and calendars for you. Image: Google Unlike Apple, Google doesn't have a dedicated app to help you defect to its mobile OS, but it does have a website with a lot of the information you're going to need: essentially you're instructed to use Google Drive to copy over contacts, photos, videos and calendar entries, which we'll cover in more detail below. If you're thinking about switching from iOS to Android in the future, or like to swap mobile OSes on a regular basis, then Google's cloud-centric services make the task much easier — so your best off keeping all your data there. By contrast, the only official Apple app you can get on Android at the moment is Apple Music. Messages and emails Extricating yourself from iMessage is perhaps the biggest challenge facing those jumping ship to Android. iMessage doesn't work on Google's platform, and there's no way to export all your message history into a comparable Android app. You're going to have to say goodbye to iMessage, but you can at least ensure a clean break. As soon as you know you're making the move go into your iOS and navigate to Messages in Settings and turn iMessage off, then go to FaceTime in Settings and turn that off too. Apple's full instructions are here. If you have some precious iMessages or plain old SMSes you can't leave behind, you'll need to rely on third-party software and some rather convoluted processes to back it all up. iSMS2droid promises to import messages from an unencrypted backup you made in iTunes on your computer into Android. If you don't need the backup on your phone, then PhoneView (macOS) and CopyTrans (Windows) are two of many tools that will let you browse your old missives to your heart's content. It's goodbye to iMessage. Image: Screenshot As for emails, Apple's system supports IMAP, so you can carry on checking your iCloud emails through Gmail on Android if you're not having a fresh start and giving up your old email address completely. Tap the drop-down arrow on the Gmail app menu, choose Add account, and follow the configuration instructions provided by Apple. It's the same process if you're using any other kind of email app on your new Android device, like Outlook from Microsoft. The only requirement is that it supports the popular IMAP protocol. You have a couple of other options if putting your iCloud account directly into Gmail doesn't appeal. You can have all your Apple iCloud emails automatically forwarded to your new Gmail address, by going into iCloud Mail on the web and setting up forwarding — you can even delete the originals after they're passed on. Alternatively, you can export all your old emails using Mail on a Mac just in case you ever need them again, then close down your Apple account. Contacts and calendars As long as you just want to make a one-way, one-time switch from iOS to Android, then Google Drive for iOS makes the process of moving contacts and calendars over simple enough. Once you've got the app installed on your iOS device, open the menu then tap Settings and Backup. Choose the data you want to transfer across to the equivalent Google accounts, tap Start Backup and you're on your way — everything from iOS and iCloud gets picked up. Make sure you're on wi-fi, and the iPhone is plugged in during the switchover. Also note, that any previous backups you've done will be overwritten. macOS can help make switching calendars easier. Image: Screenshot If you want a two-way sync, which you might if you're using your Android phone with an Apple laptop, then it's a lot more complicated. The best option, really, is to switch to using Google contacts and calendars as much as you can, and then adding your Google account to the relevant apps in macOS (Add Account from the main app menu in both cases). Even then you need to make sure you're always adding events to the Google calendars (or contacts) and not the iCloud ones for them to show up on your phone. If you absolutely must keep both Google and iCloud services running concurrently, and syncing with each other, then you'll need to put your trust in a third-party app for macOS or Android. Photos and videos Since Google Photos came into the world it's actually pretty easy to get all your personal photos and videos moved over to Android, via Google's servers, as long as they're all still on your iPhone: Install Google Photos for iOS, opt to back everything up, and away you go. You can either pay Google for storage and keep everything at full resolution, or accept some resizing (images max out at 16 MP, videos at 1080p), and store as many photos and videos as you like on the web, free of charge. The process is even more straightforward if you use the Google Drive app as we described in the section above, and Google Photos even supports Live Photos these days, using those extra few frames of animation to create a GIF for you. The only negative is that the albums you've created in iOS don't get copied over (everything appears as one long list of pictures), so you need to create them again. Google Photos can transfer images and videos. (Image: Google) All that is easy enough but if you've got photos in iCloud you've moved off your iPhone then you might have a problem or two on your hands. As we explained in our full guide to the topic of switching between Apple Photos and Google Photos, just about the only option open to you is downloading them all from iCloud to a macOS or Windows machine then uploading them again using a Google Photos client. It's a little convoluted but it's manageable, and it's a lot easier than using the export options in iCloud on the web, which are practically non-existent. If you don't have a computer to act as the middleman between iCloud Photo Library and Google Photos then you're stuck — you'll have to borrow a laptop from someone. Music and movies As we now have Apple Music on Android, getting your iTunes music on your Android device is no longer the exercise in frustration it once was. As far as tunes you've actually purchased directly from iTunes, it's probably the best option out there, though you do need to have signed up for an Apple Music subscription to be able to use the app and get at your purchases. Otherwise, it depends on where your music is and how it's stored. Any plain old MP3s you were syncing to your iPhone from iTunes can be uploaded to Google Play Music instead (50,000 of them can be stored for free), or you can use something like DoubleTwist, which is just about the leading choice if you want to keep on using iTunes alongside Android for your music. If you're signed up for Spotify you just need the Android app. Apple Music, now on Android. Image: Screenshot Likewise, if you've been accessing all your movies and TV shows through Netflix, Plex or Google Play Movies & TV then you just need to find and install the relevant app for Android and you're ready to go. All these services let you stream to multiple devices from a single account, so you can carry on using your iOS device if you need to. However, any videos you've purchased from iTunes won't run on Android at all — there's just no app to do it unless Apple ever gets around to making one. Several tools out there will do the job of removing iTunes DRM for you, but since we're getting into murky legal territory with that, we'll leave you to discover them for yourself. If you've invested hundreds of dollars in an iTunes digital library then you can still watch it on macOS, Windows, and the Apple TV, but not Android. Apps and games Generally speaking, all the apps you use on your iPhone are going to be available on Android as well, though there are a few exceptions — like Overcast and Day One. In terms of paid-for apps, you're going to have to pay for them all again, unfortunately, though something like a Spotify subscription buys you access on both Android and iOS. Whether all your data (from documents to saved games) moves over with you is another matter and worth checking up on before you make the switch. If you're in any doubt, get in touch with the developer directly to see what the situation is (you might be out of luck with anything that relies heavily on the iCloud storage system). Some paid-for iOS games, like Alto's Adventure, are free to play on Android. (Image: Noodlecake Studios Inc) We can't give you a guide to everything out there, but think about your productivity, fitness, and banking apps. Assess how much data is stored locally and what's going to happen to it. If you can, keep your old iPhone and new Android phone running alongside each other for a while until you're certain everything's been moved over successfully without too many bumps in the road. You might not believe it if you've read everything that's above, but moving from iOS to Android is actually much easier than it used to be, thanks mainly to an increased focus on cloud services (even, belatedly, from Apple itself). As long as you take your time, and don't live your life inside iMessage, you don't have to feel daunted by the task.

The Google Play Store was coming, and with it millions of Android applications that would resolve the “app gap” keeping Chrome OS from being a serious contender for many. Microsoft Office, social media applications, and even some popular games would help Chromebooks grow beyond their reputation as simple machines that are just for browsing the web. It hasn’t gone so well. According to the Google site that tracks which Chromebooks are Play Store eligible, only a handful are on board. And even when the flagship Samsung Chromebook Pro launches the Play Store’s inclusion will still technically be in beta. There was no splashy demo at I/O this year, but there was one developer event that unrolled a lightly scratched out roadmap of where things are going. The future’s coming, just not quite as quickly as we thought. The Latest from Google I/O A Google I/O session led by Shahid Hussain, a product manager on Chrome OS, shed some light on why this effort is slogging along. For example, Google is grappling with performance and proper implementation of its own apps from smartphones to Chromebooks. The presentation featured a view of Google Maps, which awkwardly showed empty bars on either side of the app when it was launched on a Chromebook. Not surprisingly, turning applications that were originally built for devices that fit in pockets into software for more traditional computers is a serious challenge. One remedy is a new Chrome emulator beta for developers to test how their app looks and performs on a Chromebook. It’s one of many pieces of technical work that Google is doing to improve the experience. Additionally, apps built for Android Nougat and the forthcoming Android O will be further optimized for Chromebooks, with the Google team pushing to ensure features like using apps in split-screen mode and easy window resizing come to be. If there’s one upside to this nearly year-long beta test, is that it means everything will hopefully be sorted out correctly. Google knows this process needs to be smoothed out, it’s just unfortunate that a $550 laptop will launch with what feels like an unfinished feature. Where Chromebook Use Stands Today In principle I love the concept of a Chromebook. My productivity life revolves Google apps, and as an Android user I enjoy the integration that comes with all my tabs syncing across Chrome and the “buy once, use anywhere” ethos of the Play Store. The other day my Windows 10 PC reported that 98 percent of my battery life usage was, you guessed it, from Chrome. Cutting out the middleman OS makes a lot of sense. The Play Store is a great idea, it just hasn’t quite resolved all of the pain points for going all-in with Chrome OS. However, much of the work world still runs in Office, so using Microsoft’s app suite is essential. Not all Microsoft apps have been fully vetted for Chrome - for example, I can download Outlook and OneDrive to my Asus Chromebook Flip but not Word, Excel, or PowerPoint. Yes, there are the Office Online versions, but the rapid development pace of the Android applications make these the ideal suitors for my productivity needs. A device like the Chromebook Pro tempts me as a potential daily driver. For others who may have lighter computing needs, a Chromebook is the right choice. I want to get there, but Android apps, even with some excellent choices like Adobe’s suite, still haven’t quite won me over. A Brighter Road Ahead? Google thrives on optimism, so of course there’s a plan for how to resolve the future of the integration of Android apps with Chromebooks. As The Verge discovered, the Samsung Chromebook Pro will kick off what Google plans to be a new phase, where some Android features may one day come to Chrome OS before they hit Android. That would be a great coup, because Chromebooks are on a six-week update cycle. Android, by contrast, has an annual dessert-themed upgrade with monthly security releases. While this won’t happen with Android O, it’s easy to see why specific APIs or features that make sense on a Chromebook shouldn’t have to wait to come to phones first. Such a new scheme would certainly be welcome. Scaling things up from mobile to a larger form factor isn’t easy - even the iPad Pro has plenty of growing pains. But getting this right is critical if Google is going to take Chrome OS deeper into the enterprise and consumer markets as a viable option to the current platform kings. Print reprints Favorite EMAIL Tweet Discuss this Article 1 CajunMoses on May 26, 2017 I think that what Google is experiencing with melding Chrome OS and Android is what Microsoft experienced when trying to meld MS DOS with the original Windows GUI. Let's hope that Google fares better than MS did because MS never even came close to figuring out how to make it work properly.

The notices point to a wide variety of infringing movies and TV-shows, all served from Googlevideo.com URLs. This recent surge shows that Google has a hard time stopping pirate streaming sites from exploiting its servers. Pirate streaming sites and services are booming. Whether through traditional websites, apps or dedicated pirate boxes, streaming TV-shows and movies in high quality has never been so easy. Unwittingly, Google plays a significant role in the shady part of online media distribution. As we highlighted earlier this year and long before, many pirate sites and servers exploit Google’s servers. By using simple tricks, pirate site operators have found a way to stream videos directly from Google Drive and various other sources, often complete with subtitles and Chromecast support. The Boss Baby streaming from Googlevideo.com The videos in question are streamed from the Googlevideo.com domain, as pictured above, which is increasingly being noticed by rightsholders as well. If we look at Google’s Transparency Report, which only applies to search, we see that roughly 13,000 of these URLs were reported until the end of last year. In 2017 this number exploded, with over a quarter million reported URLs so far, 265,000 at the time of writing. Reported Googlevideo.com URLs Why these URLs are being reported to Google search isn’t clear, because they don’t appear in the search engine. Also, many of the URLs have special parameters and only work if they are played from the pirate streaming sites. That said, the massive surge in reports shows that the issue is a serious problem for rightsholders. For their part, pirate sites are happy to keep things the way they are as Google offers a reliable hosting platform that’s superior to many alternatives. The question remains why Google has a hard time addressing the situation. It is no secret that the company uses hash matching to detect and block pirated content on Google Drive, but apparently, this doesn’t prevent a constant stream of pirated videos from entering its servers. TorrentFreak reached out to Google for a comment on the situation. A company spokesperson informed us that they would look into the matter, but a few days have passed and we have yet to hear back. Interestingly, while we were writing this article, reports started coming in that Google had begun to terminate hundreds, if not thousands of “unlimited” Drive accounts, which were sold through business plan resellers. These accounts are actively traded on eBay, even though reselling business Drive accounts is strictly forbidden. Many of these accounts are also linked to streaming hosts, so it could be that this is Google’s first step to getting a tighter grip on the situation.

Google Contacts 2.0 includes a cleaner UI and changes to contact management [APK Download] Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/11 1:53pm PDTMay 11, 2017 72 Plus 1 on G+ 155 Share on Facebook 123 Share on Twitter Total Shares350 Applications Downloads Google News The Google Contacts application really hasn't changed much over the years - after all, it just has to store contacts. Last year the app was updated with a hamburger menu and the ability to merge duplicates. Now Google has released version 2.0 of the Contacts app, with more design improvements and changes to how contacts are sorted. New design Contacts 2.0 has several minor interface tweaks all over the place, which address a few gripes I (and likely some of you) have had with the application. The actual list of contacts looks the same, but the slide-out menu now features an account switcher.    Left: Contacts 1.6; Center, Right: Contacts 2.0 Previously, the app would show all contacts from all your synced Google accounts together. Now you can easily keep contacts separate, or still combine all of them if you want. Another noticeable change is on the contacts themselves - the user icon has been reduced to a small circle instead of covering the top half of the screen.   Left: Contacts 1.6; Right: Contacts 2.0 There are a few other changes on the contact pages. The menu has removed the option to link a contact, but it has a new 'Move' item that moves contacts to another Google account. The edit button has also been moved to a floating action button. Other changes Moving on to the app settings, you can now choose which accounts to use when exporting contacts. Contacts 2.0 also supports Android O's notification channels, with a single channel called 'Notifications' (really helpful name, I know).   A quick look at the APK code reveals that this channel is used for export status notifications. I'm not really sure what the point of implementing Notification Channel support is if your app only has one kind of notification, but props to the Contacts team for getting a head start on Android O support. Finally, there is a new splash screen when you open Contacts for the first time: It basically just tells you that the app will automatically back up your contacts, which might not have been immediately obvious to people using Android for the first time. APK Download The APK is signed by Google and upgrades your existing app. The cryptographic signature guarantees that the file is safe to install and was not tampered with in any way. Rather than wait for Google to push this download to your devices, which can take days, download and install it just like any other APK.

Grey Corbin, please. You have to rip Google for this. It's inexcusable. Someone needs to put pressure on the company for their ridiculous UI beliefs. Wasted space galore, circular images for the sake of circular images. This is the peak of their insanity. We used to rip Google for their UI issues all the time. Now they are trying, but that doesn't mean we no longer criticize them. Look at this! I still remember the Nexus 4 announcement, when they introduced this version of Contacts. They praised the big, beautiful, high-res images, and the fact that the new camera could capture them. Now it's five years later and we've gone in the complete opposite direction? Please, someone at AP step up to the plate. Filipe Santos Yup, the overall changes are very good but that wasting space is so bad.... They try at least like Corbin said morteum Why are these tiny contact pictures becoming a thing? Filipe Santos People are starting to use glasses 😂😂 Jimk4003 I think it's because a lot of contact photos are low Res images synced of social media that look awful when blown up to fill half a screen. A smaller photo might not be as dramatic, but at least it isn't a pixelated mess. At least, I assume that's the thinking behind it. Corbin Davenport Yeah, blurry contact photos were a constant problem with the old design. Though, a tiny icon that takes up almost as much space isn't much better. Mochen Liu But you can change a high res photo yourself if you cam't stand it... I have high res photos for most of my contacts. Android Developer How ? You took a picture yourself, or used an app like "SyncMe" (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.syncme.syncmeapp&hl=en) or "ContactSync" (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lb.contacts_sync&hl=en) ? Grey Blurry contact photos are only a problem if you don't care about your contact photos. And if you don't care about them, then you aren't interested in fixes. Savage Alien I remember some of this being Google's fault. A while back, before the whole Material Design era, There was inconsistent syncing between web and mobile and somehow resulted in low res version of the images being synced even when you used high res images since the servers would keep low res copies for thumb nails and things. tismondo Has this problem been fixed? It definitely happened to me - I stopped bothering managing my contact photos because I got tired of blurry versions syncing across every time I replace my phone or flash a ROM. Sashank Narayan Yes, it has since been fixed. I haven't had the issue in a few years now. Elizabethmgamble Google is paying 97$ per hour! Work for few hours and have longer with friends & family! !mj247: On tuesday I got a great new Land Rover Range Rover from having earned $8752 this last four weeks..

Maxr1998 Well, you can of course just click the image to expand it to fullscreen, right? Right?! - Oh nevermind, it's Google, how could I forget. sigh.. EDIT: OH MY GOD, YOU ACTUALLY CAN! catalysto Actually, you can do exactly that. Maxr1998 Yeah, just found out myself. Everything ok then 😜 Willie Chalmers III At least Google followed their material design guidelines in the original layout. The newer layout is a true waste of space. PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ +1 for cute doggie pic. http://livewallpaper.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/cute-dog-wallpaper12.jpg JacobTheDev I honestly prefer the old one, never had an issue with "wasted space." It's not really wasted, it's a design decision, and I think it's effective in that it treats the contact as a person and not just a bunch of random data; it helped to identify who's contact information you where looking at. I hope this doesn't affect how phone calls come in... Chris Wachtman I really prefer the old design on the left. I set decent photos for my frequent contacts, and I enjoy seeing them prominently displayed. Anyone else use the Contact homescreen widget? Alfredo Hernández Exactly, it would suck big time if they gave the Phone app the same treatment. incognito27 I wouldn't call the left one a waste of space. It actually looks nice. There is nothing wrong with it. The right one though. Ooohooo. The circular icon seems pointless. Winston This is why I like Samsung's Contacts app. It displays a tiny circle like the version 2.0 one if the image is low res, but displays a half-height full-res image like the earlier build if it has an HD one. Which you can swipe down to view in its entirety. Fruity101079 Seriously, this is so stupid. Why selling big screen phones if it's to have ridiculous tiny pictures!!?? If people have blurry pictures, that's their problems. A lot of us took time to use "high res" pictures for all our contacts. And we have to deal with people who doesn't care.... >:( F4LL0U7 I was hoping the Contacts app would bring in the recently-removed feature from Google+ that allows you to keep your contacts up to date, using your contacts' linked Google accounts and downloading that info into your own Contacts app. Since they removed that feature from G+, when I got a new phone I had to download an old version of G+, sync contacts, and then update G+. Another gripe I have about Contacts: every time I reset my phone, the contacts that I previously merged (before resetting) become unmerged and I have to do it all over again. Michael Tran I think it just pulls automatically now. I added a new contact and entered in their gmail and it pulled the photo automatically. The option is gone from G+ but it still did it anyway. F4LL0U7 Pulling the photo always worked, but linking with G+ pulled in all other info, like address, phone, etc. as well. Michael Tran Ah okay. I understand now. cadtek91 This also took away the ability for the phone to download your own photo for the User account photo in the quicksettings drawer. Savage Alien I've never liked having a blank user picture, and each time I wiped my phone I'd be frustrated having to remember how to get mine to show up. Always surprised this was a feature "buried" in Google+.... and now it's gone? No other way to have your google photo to show up? F4LL0U7 Can you believe that?! The only other way is to manually select a photo yourself. There doesn't seem to be any other way to pull in your Google profile pic, other than installing an old version of G+. Disqusman Yup...only realised that yesterday when I reset my Nexus 6P. Sux. I manually set a photo...but I may download an older version of G+ to get all the contacts to sync. cadtek91 Not that I know of. You could manually add the same photo but eh. F4LL0U7 I hate that! That's the main reason why I grabbed an old version of G+, so I could have my profile pic show up. Phil Worst decision ever. I see I'm not the only one who keeps an old Version of G+ around for that exactly. Downloads at APK Mirror must have gone up quite a lot :D F4LL0U7 I should probably do that too. Now that I think of it, I have no idea which version I download. Which version is it? Tiuri Elvander If you add a picture to your Allo profile, this picture shows up in the quick settings drawer. cadtek91 I have an Allo picture, but still no user picture. YouNex Merging contacts has always been a mess, it never syncs properly. Just copy any additional details and remove the other doublons, keep only 1 per each contact. It's manual but more fail-proof Ben Godfrey This used to bug me too. I think if you merge contacts via the new web interface (the pretty material design one, not the old Gmail-looking one), it will sync the changes across everything. It's been a while since I've had to merge duplicates, though -- somebody let me know if this is incorrect. F4LL0U7 Cool thanks, I'll try that! Carson Saldanha Finally none of those low-res, blown up contact pictures. Savage Alien Haven't had that issue in years. Carson Saldanha It's mainly with those people who use low-res pics for their Google account. Savage Alien I'd take fuzzy photo over this new design. I have maybe one low res contact photo and I picked it myself for nostalgia reasons. Cameras on phones are only getting better, too, so this isn't a great excuse to use going forward... (and even much older phone would likely take passable photos) Luzandro Haven't seen this for a long time, but even if this is a real problem for some people, there are better ways to solve it. For example I've seen a dialer/contacts app (don't recall the name) where some sort of dots effect was applied to low res images, which made them look quite nice actually roberto.elena Can the contact names still be edited using multiple fields like name prefix, first name, middle name, etc. or is it all one field now like in the new web version? Tiuri Elvander Customising which groups show up doesn't work for me. People from other groups are still shown in the list. Martins Nkem Looks like the Samsung contact app.. Good job Google Kurt Gomez Can't link contacts across accounts anymore Mochen Liu I love the yuge portrait design... why google? why?... Savage Alien Terrible design. Haven't updated my Phone Dialer app either because they made the same change to it months ago. Android Developer It's even worse during call. What's the point of having HQ image for contacts, if I can't see them nicely during call... I tried to request for this here: https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/36705104 But for some reason they didn't agree. Bewear It's... ugly. Tim Harman Can you pick which photo to use from the multiples available in a merged account? It annoys me no end I can't pick the really lovely photo of my wife, instead of just the lovely one Google picked. It used to be a feature, then it went away somewhere. Trevor Hawk They also removed the ability to customize which contacts to display in settings Corbin Davenport Are you sure? It's still there for me. Trevor Hawk Yep. It's gone for me. https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B6dKMVDga-L9MkwxZGJDUVJBLW8 Alfredo Hernández Damn, that's weird. I definitely still have it on mine. Tiuri Elvander In your first screenshot there an option "contact to display". Surely that's what you want??? Trevor Hawk Thats a screen shot of the older version Tiuri Elvander Ah, my bad. That's very weird. 2 Men-E I much prefer the large contact picture... whispy_snippet Same. Disqusman Agree 100% derp_cookies We also preferred an integrated, all-in-one chat application too... YouNex Whiter =/= cleaner, this isn't some sort of effing clothes King_Android This might the first time ever I will wait for an update to be forced upon me with a Google app. 😱 jcopernicus I can honestly say the contact portraits are great use of space. Not some soul less list of information. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/a4a682a8e0c801948117beab20317cc0df2b2d6bac2c85d9ac535412608edc9f.png Ygor Cortes The new contact page with the ridiculously small picture looks disgusting. The old one was much better. Oh Google... Ygor Cortes I'm glad that I don't use Google Contacts anymore for a while now! Timothy Bracken It looks like your blocked numbers are now part of the contacts app. Does this mean that blocked numbers are now backed up and restorable? I can't test this since I don't have a 2nd device. Grey Does Contacts have a Personal Profile yet that is stored on the web? How does Google not have that in 2017? Corbin Davenport It does if you go to settings and tap 'Your info.' Grey That's a local profile. It's not available on the web. In the Gmail app, when I ask it to add my email to contacts, it can't see my "Your Info", and it instead looks for a contact entry. It doesn't exist. Android is 8 years old and does not have this option. Tiuri Elvander Your Google+ profile??? Grey Which is not a part of Contacts. Also, maybe you don't want to use Google+ but would like to have a "Self" profile in your contacts (without making yourself your own contact entry). Winston Being a Google app, I'm surprised it's not already on version 89.7 JG I have a cross-platform upgrade that involves Contacts I'd love to see Google make... Google made a comment about their commitment to helping improve online security [probably in an article talking about their use of HTTPS helping to encrypt the majority of web traffic]. I'd like to see them step this commitment up. They're working on a key server that's supposedly more focused on linking the key to a particular profile (to ensure the key belongs to the person claiming its theirs). I'd like to see Google launch the service. Create a new app that allows us to either create a new key or upload an existing key. Update Contacts to link to the key server database and automatically pair contacts with their corresponding public keys (if a match exists). Update Android Messages, Hangouts, Allo, GMail, et al to automatically encrypt any outgoing messages to contacts with public keys. Then even non-technical people can begin using encrypted messages. All it'd take is to download an app, tap a button or two and bam. Disqusman My God! Who made that decision to go with the tiny circular image?! The large contact picture is so much more beautiful. I really dislike how they changed the UI in the dialer to the small contact picture as well :/ ast00 The new contact page with the tiny picture and lots of wasted space is a step back. Shailesh Kumar Is it only exclusive to pixel devices? How can I have this on my moto x style? Daan Smit Guys, I am just not able to display contacts from a number of Google contact groups and my outlook contacts. I can only see my outlook contacts if I either opt for viewing all candidates or only outlook contacts. This also happens on the standard OnePlus3t contacts app. It used to work on Marshmallow though. Is this an Android issue? Exalm It seems they're getting rid of cards and shadows everywhere in favor of simple lists.Flat notifications and quick settings (Nougat), flat dialing screen, flat app drawer in Pixel Launcher, flat Play Store My Apps screen, and now flat contact page. What next? :) Cakefish I'm planning to replace my Galaxy S7 with the Pixel 2 this year because I usually prefer Google's UI, but in this case I actually prefer Samsung's contact app UI: https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/55ecc6c4c968731fab76e21b370c08aeaf4c2fce79c88314a96bbbf54656503b.png Alex Rusinov How do you link / merge contacts now? Selecting multiple contacts doesn't provide an option to merge only to share. Also I can't find "link" feature anywhere, only "unlink" Zachary Dunn Cleaner? You mean they got rid of the colorful highlights and made it into another white/gray bland app. They could have scaled down the image a bit to take less space. But a full hero image looks much better than a huge gray space with a tiny avatar iamakii I'm liking this cleaner look and interface Nick Felker Regarding notification channels, they will be required in Android O for all apps before a notification can be presented. So expect to see other apps follow suit. Just Is the rollout halted? I'm still not seeing 2.0. Not that if I crave to have it whith this new tiny avatar circle.

The simple one-to-one video calling app that is a direct alternative to Apple’s FaceTime is currently available for Android and iOs users. “Duo takes the complexity out of video calling so that you can be together in the moment wherever you are,” Google said in its blogsite. When a user signs up, the app checks user’s phone number then sends a confirmation text. The said app does not require a user to sign up a Google account. Duo seamlessly switches between mobile data and Wi-Fi without dropping the call. It also comes with a feature called Knock Knock which lets the user to see live video of the caller before answering the call. In addition, the Duo is built with an emphasis on privacy and security, and all calls are end-to-end encrypted. “Users are reluctant to video call because they don’t know if the other person is on the right network, the right device or it’s a good time to call. We’ve tried to remove all that friction and make it feel like an invitation, not an interruption when someone calls you,” Amity Fulay, Google’s group manager for communications said in a theguardian.comreport. Google said that their latest application will be live worldwide in the next few days.

Fake websites are sprouting up almost daily and appear on search engines like Google when unwary travellers tap in popular destinations in their hunt for a summer getaway. Families looking for the perfect villa in the sun assume their search has produced listings of authentic lettings companies and often follow instructions to book directly with the owner of their chosen property. Duped: Mark High, above, was taken in by a bogus website and lost £4,500 But on closer inspection an increasing number of these websites are fake. Many are convincing copies of genuine websites, often put together by scammers using images and adapted wording culled from genuine travel firms’ web pages. These can be combined with photos of professional people from random websites around the world who are presented as holiday property owners or agents. HOOKING HOLIDAYMAKERS One way fraudsters can achieve immediate high positions on search engine listings is by taking part in ‘pay per click’ campaigns where the engine company makes a small charge to show adverts above the natural website searches. Tap in ‘villa holidays’, for example, and many legitimate companies appear. But in among these lurk bogus websites that have also signed up. Nick Cooper, co-founder of long-established villa rental firm VillaPlus, has made it his mission to unmask fraudsters. He says: ‘Fake villa holiday websites are being given a helping hand by multi-billion pound companies who should be doing more to help tackle fraud.’ RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next SUN SCAM: From fake airline tickets to religious trips, how...

Share this article Share 11 shares He adds: ‘Web hosting companies also refuse to close down fake websites, without an expensive court order or police intervention, despite being shown clear evidence of fraud. Meanwhile, these fake companies can run major ad campaigns, appearing high up on Google searches for months before finally being stopped.’ In a statement Google said: ‘We have a set of policies which govern what ads we do and do not allow. These policies make it clear that we do not allow fraudulent or misrepresentative websites. If we discover websites that are breaking this policy, we quickly take appropriate action.’ Travellers also need to be wary that fake websites often hook them in with worthless booking guarantees promising refunds in the event someone chooses to cancel. Feeling reassured, bookers pay the rental by bank transfer. But the cash is usually withdrawn as soon as it has landed in the fraudster’s account – which is usually based abroad. HUNT FOR CLUES The Mail on Sunday carried out a reverse image search on a picture of apparent property agent Alexios Panagakos featured on bogus website greekvillaescapes.com. This is the website that tricked readers Julie and David (not their real names) out of £6,000 in a case featured last month. The photo is in fact that of an executive from an insurance firm in the US, which appears on his LinkedIn profile. To do a reverse image search, first click on the photo and then right click on the option ‘search Google for image’. Results will appear showing pictures that are visually similar as well as listings for pages that include the exact same photo. Some fake websites flip the stolen photos of properties in a bid to prevent internet image searches exposing the fraud. As this paper reported earlier this month the scourge of bogus websites is increasing as the summer holiday season looms closer. A report by the City of London Police revealed a 20 per cent leap in reported holiday frauds in 2016 with more than 100 people a week losing on average in excess of £1,200 each. The figure is likely to be far higher as victims are often too embarrassed to report they have been tricked. After reading our reports, reader Mark High feared the worst for a booking he and his wife Kerry had made less than 36 hours previously. Mark discovered to his horror that they had been scammed out of £4,532 after booking a villa in Tenerife through sham website Canaries Holiday Villas – a website Nick Cooper warned Google about more than a month earlier. The couple have arranged villas previously online without a problem – and always paid by bank transfer rather than credit card so did not suspect crooks were at work. He says: ‘We discovered the villa was real but is only available through genuine agency James Villas that had already rented it for our dates. We realised then we had been conned.’ The Highs, from Lincolnshire, contacted their bank HSBC immediately. But the call centre told them there was nothing that could be done. The Mail on Sunday intervened and HSBC took a fresh look. After contacting the receiving bank in Dublin the bank managed to retrieve the couple’s money. Gas engineer Mark says: ‘We were disappointed with HSBC for fobbing us off and are sorry that it took The Mail on Sunday to make them act. But we are overjoyed they did the right thing and we can now take our children on holiday as planned. It was supposed to be a treat for us all after my wife’s mother died and left us some money. The children were so upset when they thought it wouldn’t happen.’ The couple came forward because they ‘do not want this to happen to other families’. MORE ACTION NEEDED Critics believe both internet search engines and banks need to take more comprehensive action to protect customers. Martyn James, of consumer complaints website Resolver, says: ‘Fraud works because the fraudsters are clever, manipulative and convincing.’ Fight: Martyn James says banks must take action He adds: ‘While banks aren’t responsible for the actions of fraudsters, they do have an obligation to their customers to do all they can to get their cash back the moment they are told there is a problem. Suspicious transfers should not take place immediately and warnings about transferring money to strangers could easily be given in person or online.’ Meanwhile, payments firms are debating how to combat bank transfer fraud and industry group The Payment Strategy Forum is proposing a ‘confirmation of payee’ system. This aims to help people avoid sending payments to the wrong account, either by accident or being tricked into doing so – by ensuring confirmation of the recipient is sent to the payer before funds leave the original account. A spokesperson for Lloyds Bank says it will always try to retrieve the funds if asked in a process that can take 28 days. She adds: ‘Where customers are delayed in reporting, the chan- ces of obtaining a full recovery are low.’ Julie and David heard last week that their quick action following reading our warnings meant the bank has managed to retrieve the majority of their lost £6,000. How the police target the rip-off schemes With fraudsters often based abroad to better evade detection it can be hard for police to track them down and take action. So police tactics involve attempting to undermine the scammers’ operations instead. The City of London Police runs Action Fraud, the national reporting centre for all types of internet fraud. Vigilant: City of London Police have a ‘disruptions team’ for fraud It has a ‘disruptions team’ where officers work with banks, internet services and technology companies to tackle rip-off schemes. A spokesman says: ‘Last year, we requested 160,000 phone lines, websites (including travel websites) and bank accounts be closed in order to disrupt these fraudsters.’ Since hoaxers often set up new websites as quickly as the old ones are closed, detectives instead put emphasis on warning holidaymakers and making suggestions on how they can protect themselves.  Share or comment on this article e-mail 11 shares Most watched Money videos Rolls-Royce showcases its bespoke capabilities in stylish car Investing Show: Should you invest in India?

The new feature, which was spotted by Search Engine Roundtable, works when you are logged into your Gmail account, and of course, when you do a normal Google search. However, you won’t spot or be able to use the new feature if you are not logged into your account. Above, you can see the new feature, with a new tab “personal” added to the dropdown menu. What happens when you try searching without logging in? That’s a fairly simple question, and the answer of course, is that the personal feature won’t appear. The feature like I said, only works when you log into your account. As soon as you log in, your search results will be presented according to what you have in your Gmail and Google Photos. It’s not a huge addition, but one that could add some fun to how you search when using Google. You will also have to click on the “More” menu to access the “Personal” tab to be able to use it. Being able to search your personal data is one that will please a lot of people—and that’s why I think the feature will attract a lot of people. If you haven’t spotted it yet, that’s because it’s gradually being rolled out by Google, and could take a few more days to reach a global audience. The fact that you can carry out all your searches from a single and simple interface, makes the feature a welcome one. It will go a long way in helping people spend more time on Google’s search page because they can access all the personal and general data they need. For those asking, the feature works on both mobile and web versions of Google, and so it’s a welcome development. So, wherever you go and whatever platform [mobile or web], accessing the new feature isn’t going to be an issue for you. Google has alleviated any issue or doubt that might arise as a result of privacy. The company added a notice right below your image, assuring that “Only you can see these results.” That should calm a lot of nerves in these days of constant vulnerability issue on the internet. The worry for me is, when you try to log into your Gmail or Photos account on a shared computer. This is a big worry because a friend or a third-party can easily view or access your private data or photos. I have tried out the new feature, and I think it’s fun to use. What are your first thought of the new feature? Have you tried it out? You can share your views with us by using the comment box below.

Google is now offering four free months of Google Play Music for new subscribers Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/26 2:17pm PDTMay 26, 2017 70 Plus 1 on G+ 511 Share on Facebook 83 Share on Twitter Total Shares664 Google News Right now it looks like Google is running a special offer for Google Play Music. New subscribers that sign up here can get four free months of service instead of the usual three. No telling how long this offer might last, so if you have been considering subscribing, now might be the time to do it. It could save you an extra $10. Again, this particular offer is only for new subscribers. I've been a fan of Play Music for a long time, though the device removal limit does get in the way when you switch between devices and ROMs as often as I do. Being able to mix your own library with those of a service also comes in handy. That way I can continue to support artists I am passionate about, without eschewing the larger selection of a subscription offering for the purposes of content discovery, all while being able to fill the gaps in that library. There are a lot of different music services out there, but if you're interested combining your curated library with music available via a subscription, then your options are limited. Spotify does allow you to play back locally stored files, which is convenient, but it isn't quite the same. Amazon also allows you to upload your music for playback via Amazon Music, and with Amazon Prime membership, you get a small library of streaming music to go along with that. For $10 a month ($8 for Prime members) you can access their full library as well. But, Google Play Music has a great interface and plugs nicely into all the other Google services we love. Maybe with this new offer, it's time you gave Google Play Music a chance? After all, even if it doesn't end up working out, you still got four free months of music out of the deal.

Carson Saldanha Wait, wdym 3 different countries? Did you share it with others or something? Ailín Ó’S I live in Ireland, so that's my main account. I have a secondary account based in England as part of a mail forwarder service I use, and my bf is Greek so I had him check the code on his account :) Carson Saldanha Oh wow! Carson Saldanha Hey, since I know it worked for you, are you able to use YouTube Red along with this Play Music free trial? Because my YT Red doesn't seem to be enabled for me. Ailín Ó’S No, unfortunately not as I live in the EU and YouTube Red is only available in USA. Carson Saldanha Weird, I'm in the US though. Ailín Ó’S Ooh that is odd. Sign out of the app then sign back in maybe? Carson Saldanha No luck :( I'm in contact with Google support atm Hopefully they can sort this out Mike Worth it alone for Youtube Red MisterAlex Sweet, I wasn't sure if that was included. Thanks. Should mention that in the main blog post. Ben Still no student membership >:( Ailín Ó’S Spotify is a great alternative @€$£5/month. Ben I know that's what I use just because it's half the price. Ailín Ó’S In Ireland Vodafone have a partnership with Spotify whereby it costs €5 standard instead of €10 regardless of if you're a student or not, they even bundle it with some of their plans. Vodafone do the same in some other countries they operate in (not all). Maybe see if any network in your country has a partnership like that? Worth a shot! Ben Oh yeah I'm on EE in the UK and I've got Apple Music for free for 6 months but like iTunes is a massive stinking turd. Ailín Ó’S I'd rather go back to the days of getting music via Bluetooth from friends than use crApple Music 😂😂 Rahul Krishna In india, we have play music for 1.4 usd/month Umang Ladia I'm only seeing 2 months offer in India.?? Rahul Krishna Well I subscribed to it when it launched here (about 2 months ago), so I can't confirm that. But at this price, there is nothing to be disappointed about. aRvInD I wish Spotify launches soon here. I can't keep using that patched version here...!! Rahul Krishna Me too xyz As it should be, you can't charge European or American prices in India. Rahul Krishna Yes true. There are lots​ of people here with a very cheap Android phone. They cannot pay much money. Julian Coronado That's actually what's keeping me away from Play Music. I've used my free months and I loved the Youtube Red too. But as a student, Spotify for $5 / month is too great to pass up on. Emiliejmosley Google is paying 97$ per hour! Work for few hours & have longer with friends and family! !sm141c: On tuesday I got a great new Land Rover Range Rover from having earned $8752 this last four weeks.. Its the most-financialy rewarding I've had..

Cakefish Spotify ftw ToniCipriani ✓pǝᴉɟᴉɹǝʌ I don't think this is a new offer, got this a while back. In fact my 4 months is expiring next week. Prefer Spotify over it. Song selection a tad bit weaker, and for foreign songs it tries to translate the song names to English and makes it hard to look up. folkrav I like it, it's way cheaper than Spotify for me - my mother, my sister, my wife and myself each pay 30$ a year and we're set - but Jesus do I hate the clients. I don't like the website's interface, I hate the Android app. But yeah, I'll deal with it cause it's cheap, I guess. Carson Saldanha Got it! Yay! Jim I wish I could somehow get it on my Amazon Echo hahaha. I guess if I had paid for a Google Home it would be worth trying out. Forget vega #getEVGA Why google play music isn't available in my country ? Ailín Ó’S Try Apple Music? They seem to be just about everywhere. Iamsecond And this is why Apple continue to dominate, because Apple are truly interested in being an international company whereas Google is just playing at it. Such a shame xyz Because Google sucks. Bartek Juszczak My GPM radio's are so good these days I love that Google is so into AI. Whether It's just "I'm being lucky" or radio from a specific song, band or album they very rarely disappoint me these days. I just make sure to thumbs up if it plays a song I particularly love. I am a student and could go cheaper with spotify but the AI generated playlists have me locked in. If it's £5 cheaper but I'm not gonna enjoy it nearly as much then it's not really a good deal. AndTheWorldMayNeverKnow I used the 3 or 4 months free trial during the holidays then bought the family plan for $14.99 a month. 4 people in my family us it and it works great, the app could use some tweaks but it's really good overall. paev If you listen to main stream music it doesn't really matter what service to use. However, if you like something unusual, weird or other languages then Google is a way to go. I found bands on Google music that Spotify displayed as not found. Google also have new synth bands that Spotify doesn't. I'm for Google too. Daniel I discovered that GPM is kinda like a music label. I once went to a section of Google play explaining how indie artists can use GPM like a music label as long as they own all their rights. Ryne Hager Ultraista (among others) keeps me using Google Play Music as well as Spotify. Carson Saldanha Does anyone else who activated the Play Music trial have YouTube Red working as well? My YT Red doesn't seem to be enabled while my Play Music is. Michael Carr I spotted a similar offer a couple of months ago, and I took it after a day or two's thought. Just last week, I moved directly into a family plan. PewPewYoureDead It's hard to recommend Google Play Music until they revamp the UI. Margaritas Ante Porcos Google Music is the only choice in some markets, like Russia, where no Spotify or Pandora are available. There are too many shortcomings in Google Music and Google never shows interest in making services better than below average. I really wonder why Google refuses to become the best at anything. Real magic here. Pixel syndrome all the way. Yet Google Music is on my phone and I use it because there's no choice whatsoever. Rob You answered your own question. If there's no alternative, then they don't have any incentive to improve the service. SupahNin10doh Stupid Dorito logo... Raymond Berger Huh, I just subscribed to the trial but you youtube red hasn't kicked in yet. Any idea how long it takes? Iamsecond If you live in the UK, about 2 years so far h20ray Google Play Music is currently available in select territories and for select account types. Umang Ladia I'm only seeing 2 months offer in India, anybody can confirm? Mohammad Ovais Yeah, same for me. Maybe it's region limited. Isolde I think you need to open the link in a browser, if you open it in the app it's just the normal 2 months. Manoj | Blogging Triggers Is Google Music really worth to it? We have better alternatives Sathiya Moorthy Karan I came across a great post, it seems to be so cool http://developeit.net/android-news-image-scanner-finder/ Zachariah Mann It only shows up as 2 free months for me. I live in Michigan. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/a19b7e9dddb67bf897c751aedf63c01917048214140db901fd783b2182d8d5c0.png Mikael Jakobsson Should mabye joine premium at Google Music if that coste like $2 max a month dont understand why they should take as mutch as someone some has app or Win32 software to PC so music controllers one they keyboards works. Tab out frome a game for pause music when the round is over is just bad. Arif Gürü And stil isnt available on Turkey xyz "No telling how long this offer might last, so if you have been considering subscribing, now might be the time to do it." No thanks, I'll just use YouTube. Only thing YT needs is an option to play audio only so I can save a wee bit more data when I don't need video.

The new app, which supports glide typing, lets users search straight from the keyboard, using normal Google search. Once the information is found, user can send it into their application without leaving the keyboard, technewsworld.com reported. No matter what application a user is using, SMS, email, WhatsApp or messenger, the Google logo is always present in the keyboard. “It’s like having a google search in any app, right from the keyboard . . . so we called it a Gboard,” said Google in a video posted in its YouTube account. “Solutions like Google’s Gboard and glide typing are designed to simplify and speed up common tasks. That can be a real boon when you’re under time pressure or are trying to create a complex message on a keyboard of limited size,” Principal Analyst at Pund-IT Charles King was quoted as saying in the same report. Emojis can be searched easily in the search bar. Typing words like “angry,” “pizza,” “cat,” and “car,” user can see all the relevant emoji characters in an instant. In addition, the application can be customized depending to the user’s liking. The user has the option to unable the glide typing, toggle things like auto-correction, auto-capitalization, enable caps lock, among others. Right now, Gboard app is only available in the United States and company has yet to announce when it will be available to download elsewhere.

It’s very colorful and lovely OLED screen is slightly smaller than the touch screen, but the player itself feels quite a bit smaller and lighter.

It seems like the Google Nexus 6P device is the last of the Nexus brand and apparently it’s replacement is something completely different. While the Nexus 6P was £449, Google raises the price for Pixel and Pixel XL handsets at about £599 and £719, respectively. The new Pixel devices are extremely good but the price place it along with the Apple iPhone 7 Plus and Samsung Galaxy S8. I mean, it has great features but are they worth £240 more? Not so much. Right now the Nexus 6P is nowhere to find, and you can have it only if you’re willing to search through second hand markets, where you can get a great deal and pay less. It’s a shame that Google thought it would be better to increase the payment. Review It was released in 2014. Although it was a pretty good phone, the size of it was enormous, so we got Nexus 6P. It’s lighter, slimmer and smaller, with a 5.7inch display, similar to the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge, Note 5 and iPhone 6sPlus. What’s new Besides those other changes, the Motorola manufacturer lets Huawei Chinese technology to take over. Huawei’s experience can be seen in the Nexus 6P’s design. In this area, it is clearly better than Nexus 6 because it’s less slippery and bulky than it was the older model and this is very important to a lot of people. The screen is protected by Gorilla Glass 4 to prevent scratches and drops. It even has the new Type-C USB ports, which leaves a mark on all the new soon to be launched devices and promises faster charging! It’s more robust than the Micro-USB version and it’s easier to plug your cable in the USB port without the fear of breaking it. You can also reverse the power and charge other devices using your phone.

Home Mail News Sport Finance Celebrity Style Weather Answers Flickr Mobile More Yahoo Search Search News Home Follow us UK Yahoo Originals General Election 17 World Finance Celebrity Sport Science & Tech Motoring TV Movies Style Weather News Video Viral Google’s latest Go victory shows machines are no longer just learning, they're teaching Mark Robert Anderson, Professor in Computing and Information Systems, Edge Hill University The Conversation 26 May 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Share Just over 20 years ago was the first time a computer beat a human world champion in a chess match, when IBM’s Deep Blue supercomputer beat Gary Kasparov in a narrow victory of 3½ games to 2½. Just under a decade later, machines were deemed to have conquered the game of chess when Deep Fritz, a piece of software running on a desktop PC, beat 2006 world champion Vladimir Kramnik. Now the ability of computers to take on humanity has taken a step further by mastering the far more complex board game Go, with Google’s AlphaGo program beating world number one Ke Jie twice in a best-of-three series. This signifcant milestone shows just how far computers have come in the past 20 years. DeepBlue’s victory at chess showed machines could rapidly process huge amounts of information, paving the way for the big data revolution we see today. But AlphaGo’s triumph represents the development of real artificial intelligence by a machine that can recognise patterns and learn the best way to respond to them. What’s more, it may signify a new evolution in AI, where computers not only learn how to beat us but can start to teach us as well. Go is considered one of the world’s most complex board games. Like chess, it’s a game of strategy but it also has several key differences that make it much harder for a computer to play. The rules are relatively simple but the strategies involved to play the game are highly complex. It is also much harder to calculate the end position and winner in the game of Go. It has a larger board (a 19x19 grid rather than an 8x8 one) and an unlimited number of pieces, so there are many more ways that the board can be arranged. Whereas chess pieces start in set positions and can each make a limited number of moves each turn, Go starts with a blank board and players can place a piece in any of the 361 free spaces. Each game takes on average twice as many turns as chess and there are six times as many legal move options per turn. Each of these features means you can’t build a Go program using the same techniques as for chess machines. These tend to use a “brute force” approach of analysing the potential of large numbers of possible moves to select the best one. Feng-Hsiung Hsu, one of the key contributors to the DeepBlue team, argued in 2007 that applying this strategy to Go would require a million-fold increase in processing speed over DeepBlue so a computer could analyse 100 trillion positions per second. Learning new moves The strategy used by AlphaGo’s creators at Google subsidiary DeepMind was to create an artificial intelligence program that could learn how to identify favourable moves from useless ones. This meant it wouldn’t have to analyse all the possible moves that could be made at each turn. In preparation for its first match against professional Go player Lee Sedol, AlphaGo analysed around 300m moves made by professional Go players. It then used what are called deep learning and reinforcement learning techniques to develop its own ability to identify favourable moves. But this wasn’t enough to enable AlphaGo to defeat highly ranked human players. The software was run on custom microchips specifically designed for machine learning, known as tensor processing units (TPUs), to support very large numbers of computations. This seems similar to the approach used by the designers of DeepBlue, who also developed custom chips for high-volume computation. The stark difference, however, is that DeepBlue’s chips could only be used for playing chess. AlphaGo’s chips run Google’s general-purpose AI framework, Tensorflow, and are also used to power other Google services such as Street View and optimisation tasks in the firm’s data centres. Lesson for us all The other thing that has changed since DeepBlue’s victory is the respect that humans have for their computer opponents. When playing chess computers, it was common for the human players to adopt so-called anti-computer tactics. This involves making conservative moves to prevent the computer from evaluating positions effectively. In his first match against AlphaGo, however, Ke Jie, adopted tactics that had previously been used by his opponent to beat it at its own game. Although this attempt failed, it demonstrates a change in approach for leading human players taking on computers. Instead of trying to stifle the machine, they have begun trying to learn from how it played in the past. Read More In fact, the machine has already influenced the professional game of Go, with grandmasters adopting AlphaGo’s strategy during their tournament matches. This machine has taught humanity something new about a game it has been playing for over 2,500 years, liberating us from the experience of millennia. What then might the future hold for the AI behind AlphaGo? The success of DeepBlue triggered rapid developments that have directly impacted the techniques applied in big data processing. The benefit of the technology used to implement AlphaGo is that it can already be applied to other problems that require pattern identification. For example, the same techniques have been applied to the detection of cancer and to create robots that can learn to do things like open doors, among many other applications. The underlying framework used in AlphaGo, Google’s TensorFlow, has been made freely available for developers and researchers to build new machine-learning programs using standard computer hardware. More excitingly, combining it with the many computers available through the internet cloud creates the promise of delivering machine-learning supercomputing. When this technology matures then the potential will exist for the creation of self-taught machines in wide-ranging roles that can support complex decision-making tasks. Of course, what may be even more profound are the social impacts of having machines that not only teach themselves but teach us in the process.

[Update: Now $75 Off] Deal Alert: Pixel 32GB (international version) is $50 off on eBay Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/05/26 2:20pm PDTMay 26, 2017 2 Plus 1 on G+ 42 Share on Facebook 56 Share on Twitter Total Shares100 Deals News Pixel Update 1: 2017/05/26 2:32pm PDT It looks like the price has dropped another $25, making this a $75 savings in total. For a device that hasn't seen much in the way of price drops or It's no secret that Google has had some serious supply issues with its flagship Pixel phone. That goes for pretty much any combination of size, color, or storage. Rumors even began to surface alleging that Google had stopped production of the devices altogether. That wasn't the case, but nonetheless, you will still struggle to actually find the Pixel if you wish to buy it. A 32GB Pixel (international version) on eBay for $50 off the list price could be the answer to that problem. This is the entry level 5" Pixel, with 32GB of storage in the color Very Silver - and it's available for $599. That's $50 less than the $649 Google is still charging for it. Beware though, this is the international version of the device. So if you live in the US you'll have to check the bands to see if it works on your network. This version won't play nice with Verizon or Sprint, so if you're on either of those carriers you can rule this out. If you live outside the US then this is definitely for you. Shipping appears to be free in the US, but here in the UK, it's $18.99. That still works out a bargain for me, especially if you account for the exchange rate. You'll have to do the sums from where you are to see if the deal is as good for you. It's worth mentioning that getting your warranty honored might be tough with this type of purchase, so bear that in mind. It's hard to say how many of these they have, other than a "limited quantity," so you'll have to be quick if you want to get your hands on arguably the best Android phone of 2016. Update 1: 2017/05/26 2:32pm PDT It looks like the price has dropped another $25, making this a $75 savings in total. For a device that hasn't seen much in the way of price drops or sales since launch, $75 off isn't bad. Anyone interested in a Pixel that uses a network compatible with this international model should give it a serious think.

Andy What do you mean? jonzey231 If you don't buy the phone from Google, they won't help you. They send you to the manufacturer. I was forced to go to Huawei for my 6P and it was a little over 3 weeks before I got it back....and the problem is still there. Spend the extra $50 and buy it through Google so you're guaranteed to get support through their CS channels. You'll be glad you did in 6 months when something inevitably goes wrong. IMHO get the OnePlus 3T. Costs less but has better overall specs aside from the camera which is still pretty good in its own right. My brother has one and my roommate just got his last week and they both have no intention of going back to a major brand ever again. YaKillaCJ Same happened when I got the OnePlus One. It changed the way I (and many others) view a "budget" device from an unknown brand. needa I felt the same way after using an OPO for nearly three years. Got me an XL in mint condition for $450. Google edition even. Still had 3520 mAh in the batt too. Would have bought the black 3T had they been in stock. Took me three days to hunt down this deal. Andy Got my wife the pixel. Runs great. Just had the microphone problem. Google swapped without question. Wife seems to think it takes horrible selfies. Rod Weird, as it's cameras are regarded among the best currently. Random! @andy maybe you should let her know that the camera isn't the problem... It's actually her face. If you do warn her about this, I promise to visit you at the hospital. Andy Thanks for the tip. VAVAMk_2 Huzzah! Master Yates Agreed with you regarding the 3T. Lets see if the excellent updates and support evaporate when the One Plus 5 is released? That's the real test. IcerC Except in this case Google is the Manufacturer, that might change things. VAVAMk_2 Google didn't make the camera. Uses a Sony made sensor but the camera software is Google's and regarded among the best in post processing, particularly HDR. Roy Ahh so nice call me when the 1+2 will get Nougat and your friend will get or never get Android O. ddevito #Fail Andy S8 release response? AdMoc Does not ship to Poland as fck always -_- Random!

It would be up your phone company provider whether it worked or not. So it may not work with att or tmobile either. kristin This may or may not work on any provider. Its up to the provider. You want a pixel? Go to swappa.com and get one used in mint condition for much cheaper. Ive gotten a few phones from them since ive been on project fi and had no issues. Ill never buy a new phone again. Random! $50 off? How cute... If they get to $300 off ($350 final price) within a month, I might even convince myself it's worth to stare at those bezels everyday. Other than that (impossible) scenario, I'd rather get the 3T, Axon 7, or even the LG G5. Gjorgi Lazarovski The Pixel is probably not dropping in price anytime soon. iKon The most overrated smartphone of 2016. Only the camera is decent.

No matter how much money they put into advertising there are alot of better choices out there.. only hard core Google fanboys try and big it up Roy Yes yada yada and still every reviewer said is the best smartphone of 2016. So.. even David here. In the on of the day it's a lots about the UI and I just don't like Samsung software. Ordeith LOL. You're such a Google sycophant, Roy. Roy You feeling really smart? I'm Imagine your ass all over your face. nirmitlamed Google is so off track in figuring out what customers wants and competing against the other monstrous companies. I would very much like to hear how many Pixels Google sold in the last year since they told us they sold more than they expected. Lawrence I can put my coffee cup on the Bezel David Nowicki I'm a big Nexus fan, but why would you pay $749 for the Pixel XL vs the OnePlus 3T at about half the price ? And soon the OnePlus 5 at $450 or so with S8+ specs will be a steal compared to the Pixel 4Ui812 Supply and demand. Limit the supply and you increase demand. It's like P.T. Barnum said , "There's a sucker born every minute".

Digital Trends Home > Web > Vietnam claims Google promised to help remove… Vietnam claims Google promised to help remove ‘toxic’ web content By Lulu Chang — May 27, 2017 6:04 am Share Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you The Vietnamese government claims that the search giant will be assisting in its efforts to remove anti-government content from its platform. Google is said to be helping Vietnam censor its platform. On Friday, the country’s government revealed that the search giant’s parent company, Alphabet, will be cooperating with Vietnam to remove so-called “toxic” and illegal information. The nation has previously borne criticism for its treatment of dissidents and anti-government personalities, having arrested many who have spoken out against the communist regime. The Southeast Asian regime raised concerns about “offensive” content on Facebook and YouTube (the Google-owned video platform) back in February, and persuaded Vietnamese companies to hold onto their advertising budgets until the American firms were able to address government issues. And now, it seems as though at least one company has made those adjustments. During a meeting with Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc in Hanoi on Friday, Alphabet Chairman Eric Schmidt assured Vietnam’s officials that the company would work closely alongside the administration to uphold the country’s laws. “Mr. Eric Schmidt said (he) will tightly cooperate with Vietnam to remove toxic information violating Vietnamese laws and will consider opening a representative office in the country,” the Vietnamese government said in a statement on its website. However, Google has its separate account of these discussions, with spokesman Taj Meadows telling Reuters, “We have clear policies for removal requests from governments around the world, and those policies have not changed.” He continued, “We rely on governments to notify us of content that they believe is illegal through official processes, and where appropriate, will restrict it after a thorough review.” The prime minister was not the only person with whom Schmidt met during his visit to Vietnam. In fact, Schmidt held an audience with Vietnamese singer and activist Mai Khoi, who told Reuters, “I told Eric about Vietnam’s internet censorship issue and he said he knew about it and would try to improve internet freedom here in a delicate way.”

Investors could be blaming the wrong CEO for IBM’s current problems. Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) May 27, 2017 at 2:00PM Back in March, I discussed five reasons that IBM (NYSE:IBM) could benefit from a change in management. I noted that its revenue declines wouldn't end anytime soon, that the growth of its key "strategic imperatives" was slowing down, that it remained an underdog in the cloud race, that it was too dependent on outsourcing, and that it wasn't being upfront about its layoffs. While those are still valid points, we should acknowledge that Ginni Rometty was dealt a tough hand when she became the company's ninth CEO in 2012. So today, we'll examine some of Rometty's biggest moves, and whether or not they actually moved IBM in the right direction. IBM CEO Ginni Rometty. Image source: IBM. Paying for Palmisano's mistakes Former CEO Sam Palmisano -- who led IBM from 2002 to 2011 -- arguably set the company on the wrong path in 2010, when he boldly promised to double its annual earnings per share from $10.01 in 2009 to $20 by 2015. That proclamation was so impressive that Warren Buffett, who famously avoided tech stocks, made it one of Berkshire Hathaway's top holdings. The problem was that Palmisano's "Roadmap 2015" plan mainly consisted of selling big business units (like its PC business, which it sold to Lenovo in 2004), aggressively cutting costs, and repurchasing stock. That conservative strategy boosted IBM's earnings but caused it to fall behind the tech curve as rival companies -- like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google -- invested heavily in cloud-based platforms. Abandoning Roadmap 2015 When Rometty took over, she initially followed Palmisano's playbook by cutting costs, laying off employees, and dumping lower-margin business units. The company even paid GlobalFoundries $1.5 billion to take over its money-losing chipmaking business, and its debt levels surged as it funded more buybacks with debt. But in late 2014, Rometty wisely abandoned Palmisano's $20 per share target. This decision finally gave Rometty the freedom to pursue more acquisitions in the higher-growth cloud and mobility markets. Laying down the foundations of its "strategic imperatives" Even before she scrapped Roadmap 2015, Rometty realized that IBM had fallen far behind Amazon, Microsoft, and Google in public cloud platforms -- which lend out storage space, computing power, and development tools to companies and developers. That's why Rometty had IBM acquire cloud infrastructure giant SoftLayer Technologies for $2 billion in 2013. She followed that purchase with dozens of other takeovers of businesses in the cloud, analytics, mobility, security, and social industries -- the five pillars of growth which became IBM's "strategic imperatives". Revenue from those businesses rose 12% annually last quarter and accounted for 42% of IBM's top line over the past 12 months. Without Rometty's guidance, this new category of higher-growth businesses might not even exist. Investing in next-gen technologies Rometty also created dedicated business units for next-gen technologies. In 2014, IBM created a new unit for its AI platform Watson, which may help it counter similar AI efforts at Amazon's AWS, Microsoft's Azure, and Google's Cloud Machine Learning Service. The following year, IBM launched dedicated units for the Internet of Things (IoT) and Education markets -- which expanded its big data and analytics reach into both industries. It also launched Watson Health, a dedicated unit for gathering and analyzing healthcare records from millions of devices. The company is also currently expanding its presence in the cybersecurity, quantum computing, and blockchain markets -- which could widen its moat against its biggest rivals. Halting the buybacks After abandoning Palmisano's plan, Rometty finally weaned IBM off its addiction to debt-fueled buybacks, as seen in the following chart: Source: YCharts This bold move caused IBM's annual earnings to drop 10% in 2015 and 9% in 2016, but those declines were arguably necessary to allow the pursuit of other investments and acquisitions. Looking ahead, analysts expect IBM's cost-cutting plans, stabilizing (albeit stagnant) revenues, and investments in higher-margin businesses to lift its earnings by 1% this year and 2% next year. So should investors blame the management? Shares of IBM have declined 8% this year, while the S&P 500 has gained 8%. The reasons are easy to see -- the company's revenue has fallen annually for 20 straight quarters, Warren Buffett sold about 30% of Berkshire's stake in February, and Moody's downgraded its credit rating in early May. Amid all those negative headlines, it's easy to blame IBM's management for its current woes. However, it makes more sense to blame former CEO Sam Palmisano for most of those problems. Rometty initially waited too long to abandon Palmisano's quixotic plan, but her moves over the past three years indicate that she knows how to turn around the aging company. Therefore, investors should keep those facts in mind before assuming that IBM would fare better under new management.   Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

Google co-founder Sergey Brin is spending between $100 million and $150 million to build an enormous blimp, The Guardian reports.More Google co-founder Sergey Brin is spending between $100 million and $150 million to build an enormous blimp, which will be the biggest aircraft in the world when finished, according to a new report in The Guardian. The blimp, as first reported by Bloomberg, is under construction at a giant hangar in the Nasa Ames airfield near Google headquarters in Mountain View, California. Google signed a 60-year lease for $1.1 billion in 2014, through a subsidiary called Planetary Ventures, and is working with an engineer named Alan Weston, who's employed by a company controlled by Brin's family known as LTA ("lighter than air") Research and Exploration. That company was listed in Google's 2017 proxy as a lessor of part of the Ames hangar. The blimp will be almost 200 meters (656 feet) long, the Guardian reports, and will go on humanitarian missions to remote locations as well as serving as an "air yacht" for Brin and his family.

Resold Pixel phones originally purchased from Project Fi are having their IMEIs blacklisted Richard Gao Follow View All Posts 2017/05/25 5:30am PDTMay 25, 2017 59 Plus 1 on G+ 141 Share on Facebook 58 Share on Twitter Total Shares258 Google News Pixel Pixel XL Project Fi Back in November, when the Pixel was slowly beginning to ship to customers, there were numerous reports of people getting their Google accounts banned for purchasing Pixel and Pixel XL devices with the intent to resell them. It turns out that this issue hasn't exactly been laid to rest, as it seems that Pixel phones purchased from Project Fi for this purpose are now getting blacklisted via their IMEI numbers. As an overview, people originally bought Pixels from both the Google Store and Project Fi to sell them to a New Hampshire-based reseller. Why New Hampshire, you may ask? There's no sales tax. Both parties here were supposed to make a profit, but Google ended up banning a ton of accounts for a violation of their terms of service.. Considering how important Google is in our lives (Gmail, Google Photos, YouTube, Play Store, etc.), a lot of people were obviously not happy. In the end, Google did restore many of these accounts, but it was obviously enough for a good scare. However, it seems that Google still hasn't completely forgiven people for violating their ToS. Kyle Bennett, the editor-in-chief and founder of the HardOCP website, had his Pixel XL's IMEI blacklisted just yesterday. IMEIs are typically blacklisted by carriers when phones are lost or stolen, but that's clearly not what happened here. Calling T-Mobile didn't do anything, as their staff told him that they could not reverse the blacklisting. His communication with Swappa support was more interesting, though; here's what they told him: "Sorry to hear of the complaints. We have seen a great number of Pixel devices becoming blacklisted the past two days. We are still trying to figure out why this has happened to so many devices. We are working to find out the cause of this widespread issue. It would be best for both of you to keep on top of Google and pressing them for an explanation. In one other case, I saw this morning Google agreed to send the buyer a replacement device so that might be an option to look into. Seller please work with the buyer and Google to see if they can get to the bottom of it." Kyle then contacted Google support, with the first representative claiming that he had simply received a spam message. When he showed a second rep how his IMEI had indeed been blacklisted via Swappa's ESN/IMEI checker (useful tool if you're buying a phone, by the way), he was told that his Pixel XL hadn't been reported as stolen, but that it had been originally purchased through Project Fi. Kyle was also once again told that his phone hadn't really been blacklisted, but a quick rescan of his IMEI in Swappa proved otherwise. His case was escalated to Project Fi's support team, but the customer service rep refused to give him a reference number and told him that he'd receive it via email. After contacting a third representative, Kyle was informed that his phone had indeed been blacklisted, but that Google wasn't responsible for doing so. This lends further credence to the Project Fi explanation, as it's the carrier and not the manufacturer that has the ability to blacklist devices. The situation is still ongoing, but that's all we know for now; we'll update with more information as we get it.

Okay. NeverrKnowsBest You can sell a Project Fi phone. You just buy them in bulk and try to make a profit off Project Fi. Stupid that the customer is being punished for this, though. Green Dog Is it clear that this is one of the phones that was bought in bulk from that retailer? From my reading, it was just a resold phone. I mean obviously, it's not happening to all phones, but the fact that it's still happening is a concern. NeverrKnowsBest The IMEIs are being linked to one particular reseller in New Hampshire. celestre Do you have more information than is present in the article on this? NeverrKnowsBest I'm just going off what the article said. I would love to read more, but I highly doubt they are just flipping the switch on every resold Project Fi phone. That just isn't very plausible, at least to my knowledge. datkidpatrick you misunderstood the article... they referenced a time where a bulk reseller's phones were black listed... but now it is happening to a bunch of random sellers that decided to sell the phone... Richard Gao The bulk reseller's phones weren't blacklisted at that time. It is entirely possible that these are the same phones. datkidpatrick i purchased mine straight from project fi... sold it 3 months ago and the seller told me the other day it was blacklisted... and yes my mistake.. the bulk resellers email's were blocked or something like that... Cael Did you pay off the phone before you sold it? datkidpatrick yes i did... Corey Kinard So they're punishing someone that fully paid for a device from you, who fully owned the device? They're legally allowed to just fully break something they've already sold and have no right to? This is worse than when carriers wouldn't unlock phones... datkidpatrick im still giving google the benefit of doubt that it was a mistake... they just need to fix it PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ You'll easily win in small claims court if you have to refund and take the phone back. PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ What kind of financing plan did you have? They were first sold in Oct. 22 2016 and this is only May 2017. I seem to remember 24 month financing or 12 month financing. You paid your phone off three months ago and already had sold it on Swappa for some time? datkidpatrick ya youre allowed to pay it off early... PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ Maybe that's what caused the error at Fi in blacklisting by accident. datkidpatrick ya that doesn't make any sense... but it got fixed this morning by google... NeverrKnowsBest I see that now. Thanks for the clarification. In any case, there has to be something in common with these blacklisted phones, I don't think Google/Project Fi would blacklist all second hand phones, I don't think that's very plausible. Corey Kinard Do you really need to think straight when you are in competition for largest company in the world? They probably got algorithms looking for shit and those algorithms mess up. 4Ui812 That's pretty shitty Google. David Bowline Is it really? What's shitty is the people buying in bulk just to make an easy buck and therefore screwing people over. Swappa needs to go after these people. jonzey231 Yeah but if I bought a Pixel LAST YEAR and wanted to sell it no in preparation for the next Pixel or the OP5, for example, my customer may get screwed even though it was just an innocent buy and resell. Max Uh? That's not what happened here... so far this situation seems to be the result of a reseller elaborate plan to evade tax and sell the scarce phone for a bigger profit. This wasn't an individual reselling his/her own phone. jonzey231 Uh? I know that it was originally caused by the douche bags in NJ, but now it's affecting regular people. 4Ui812 That's called capitalism. No one is forcing you to buy it. What Google needs to do is fix all the reported issues with that shitty phone. As for the limited supply of said phone , again that's Google's fault (hell , I wouldn't be surprised if Google intentionally limted the supply ... That's a play out of nintys handbook) Duder12 I have a pixel. There is nothing wrong with my phone. I love it. SirCanealot But I have a Pixel and it is broken. Surely this is not possible to exist in reality? :O :O :O A Person It may suck, but who is to decide how my money is spent? kbbl Caveat emptor. SeanPR11 Or.... don't buy your phone from a New Jersey Douchebag. If people don't buy from them, they will stop doing this bullshit. It sucks that regular people are caught in the middle (which happens all too often). It seems Swappa should have known these phones were out there (given the business they are in) and flagged them with the IMEI checker. Alex Excuse them for doing whatever they like with a product they purchased. Pfff SeanPR11 Amen. Ryan from GroupTweet Yes, its shitty. If anything Google should go after the reseller, not the innocent legitimate customers that bought the devices and who are now punished because their phones are blacklisted. Alexander Z Great Swappa can't GO after anyone. Maybe suspend/revoke their account but that's it. My trusted seller hasn't been any help at all with the blacklisted pixel I bought. It's so messed up!! T4rd Saw the site/forum owner of a site I frequent get hit with this on his Pixel this week too. Crazy how the Pixel is being plagued with all sorts of extraneous issues. They can't stay in stock, forcing people to buy second hand, then they get black listed because of some weird policy Google has with Project Fi phones. Max Well being out of stock has nothing strange coming from a Google phone, that's been their main issue for a few years now (Nexus), and it happens even to Apple on launch but the difference is that they're a lot better ramping up production afterwards. This blacklisting is really weird, but so far it seems to be potentially related to a shady reseller so we'll have to wait and see if we get more clarification soon. Geoff Johnson As someone from New Hampshire, it's weird to see my state in an AP article, since nothing interesting ever happens here lol. This sucks though because buyers who bought their Pixel 2nd hand months ago now suddenly might get it blacklisted? J.J. Holy f. That is terrible. So random guy buys a second hand pixel (because Google was out of stock) later gets blacklisted by Google/fi. Gets no help from Google. Never buys a Google phone again. Real smart. Green Dog This on top of the seeming shaky quality of the phones may force me to an iPhone. J.J. I feel ya there but, i just can't do the iPhone thing. Loving this s8+ right now. Duder12 When consumers say this its just sad. Why when you have a difficult time with one android manufacturer immediately think its all Androids and switch to the iPhone? This is how Apple gets tons of customers. Everyone that had a bad time with Samsung just assumed their only other option was iPhone bc MARKETING. Green Dog Because I don't want to have to deal with OS updates through the carrier or a limited phone in terms of LTE bands, as is common for Android phones? People like other phones and I've played with some of them, but I like the Pixel/Nexus lines. But this does give me pause. blenderboy Well, the only offering that competes with iPhone in the world of android is the pixel phone. Samsung displays(hardware in general) are great but software experience can't be compared with iPhone or pixel. It is just sad that they can't keep up with Apple or Google. Google is trying really hard to reach there. I am still using Android because of the platforms openness. Duder12 Fair enough but you know what I mean. You are an exception but A LOT of consumers act this way. Honestly I bought my Pixel through the Google Store last fall and its been solid. I love it. Google needs to sort out the second hand market but these are growing pains. Hardware is still new to them bc the nexus line had help from the OEMs. Now they dont. marcusmarcus2 His comment does not address all Androids. He is only speaking of this one phone. It could be he was between using phones by Google and iPhones and he choose to go with Google's phone. Now with this situation, he decided to go to his second choice. I'm not defending switching to an iPhone over another manufacturer, just pointing out his statement you criticized did not say what you thought it was saying and you were the one to actually apply his statement to all Androids. Just playing the devil's advocate here Alex Because when you pay 7-8-900€ (the price of an iPhone) on an Android phone you expect it to be flawless. And that's normal! However, in real life, regardless if you pay 300 or 800€, Android remains Android, with its notoriously inconsistent battery life, inexplicable wakelocks, unfixed bugs (don't get me stored on the "low priority" bugs with thousands of stars), 2 year updates, etc, etc. tekfr33kn That seems a little dramatic considering that iPhones are far from flawless. You also pay that amount for your average laptop and they aren't flawless. It seems you, or someone else, is holding Android phones to an unrealistic standard. Alex Please don't compare a laptop with an Android phone. It makes absolutely no sense. Isn't it rather that manufacturers (Google being the first of them) increase the prices each year to hallucinating levels with little to no innovation or improvement in user experience. Take the S8 line. Beautiful phones, remarkable design, but a fraction of the cost you pay goes to that crap Bixby that nobody wants tekfr33kn I'll agree with you that Google is artificially raising the price far beyond what it should be but that's basic capitalism and market forces. If the market doesn't want those kinds of prices or can't support it, it won't sell. The issue is that people are actually willing to pay that. iPhones are the primary example. There's about $400 - $500 worth of stuff put in a phone that goes for $800 - $1000 and they still sell like hotcakes. I also agree with you about the S8's and Bixby but again, the market says that the S8 is a hot seller and so Samsung isn't about to change that trend. That kind of makes your argument moot. As for comparing a smartphone to a laptop - if you can't see the comparisons, it's either willful ignorance or you just don't know a thing about electronic devices (specifically smartphones or laptops). In either case, I can't help you with that. The fact is that they share more in common that differences. It's one of the many reasons that development strategies (hardware and software) often translate quite well between them. xyz Uhm, because the phone in question is the overpriced Google phone that is intended to compete with the iPhone and which Google fanboys insist is the greatest Android phone of all time. psychic99 It costs about the same to make a Pixel XL as it does an iphone 7, so why would you expect Google to make less margin than Apple? I will say their ecosystem and support SUCKs compared to Apple, so yeah it should be hundred less because the lifecycle experience of a Pixel will be much worse than Apple and the fact that they artificially end support after 2 years is atrocious. I have 4+ year old Nexus that operate just fine on custom ROMs. And BTW I don't think it is worth it either and happily keep my Nexus 6p for less than 50% the cost. I can't rationalize the price they are asking. Google's support is not consistent. Either they will go over the top to help, or tell you go away you are screwed, There is nothing in the middle, and until you engage them you have no idea if you are going to get help or the hand. Yet another reason they should be hundreds less. Merrill Sampson Just FYI, Google announced at IO a few days ago that they're extending the support cycle on the Pixel from 2 year to 5. marcusmarcus2 Do you have a source for that? https://support.google.com/nexus/answer/4457705?hl=en#nexus_devices Android Version updates: October 2018 Security updates: October 2019 Duder12 Dont forget that apple blocked iPhones that had their fingerprint sensor replaced. Also, dont forget Apple is trying to get a bill banned that will allow consumers to have 3rd parties fix phones. PS: My Pixel is fucking awesome. NexusKoolaid "Dont forget that apple blocked iPhones that had their fingerprint sensor replaced." And this in and of itself was a good thing. With the sensor and the CPU being paired, the sudden appearance of a new sensor having a new signature was deemed to be a security breach. I'm not standing up for Apple here, just calling a spade a spade. And I don't know what information Apple could have shared with 3rd party repair houses (if they were inclined to play nice with them) without compromising security. "PS: My Pixel is fucking awesome." I wish I had one. But they were so hard to get hold of for so long that at this point I'll hang on to my 6P until the Pixel2 is out. psychic99 On Android if you reinstall the O/S or make major modifications they simply invalidate the fingerprint then you have to enter the password manually as a failback. Then you can enrol your fingerprint again. In fact every few days you have to manually enter your pin on N to get into the phone. Sounds like a reasonable method, rather than locking the phone forever. Apple went one step farther. You should go watch youtube... Apple is on a mission to make 3rd party repair a thing of the past. They even specifically make it hard to repair. They want control of the supply chain and dispose of equipment as fast as possible. NexusKoolaid On your first point, there is little control over hardware used to support the platform, so core design decisions are prone to fall back to a software solution. Apple on the other hand has tight control of their hardware and have the option for hardware based solutions, whatever the motivation might be, such as better security or to maintain control of their platform (probably a mix on the two). On your second point, I've read the headlines and seen videos on Youtube (like Louis Rossman). Yeah - their crusade against 3rd party repair sickens me to no small degree. Not just because it would prevent me from seeking out more economical and timely repair of my phone (if I had an iPhone), but because this type of precedent could trickle down to other things I might want to tinker with. Jay Hate to say it but that is the risk people run when you don't buy your devices brand new. J.J. True. But they exasperate said risk artificially for the perceived end goal.... More Profit. The truth is they are doing the exact opposite. This news definitely makes me pause on buying a pixel at all. The Second hand market is real and if i have a bad experience do to Google on a second hand device i will probably not buy new from them when i have the funds. james fuston If you (or the person who sells you a phone) violates the terms of service, you're gonna have a bad time regardless of manufacturer. blenderboy Real question to ask, did Apple ever had similar issue with many devices? hunter2 Probably not since Apple realizes that the perceived strong resale value is a determining factor for many people. Even people who may have never sold a product second hand gain some comfort from the knowledge that they could potentially recoup a lot of their costs if they ever needed to sell. ericshmerick Do the TOS say you can never ever resell the device? Serious question. ekana_stone No the TOS is that you resell as soon as you bought it, so like if you bought from fi cuz it's cheaper and the resold it a little under asking. It's only those phones that were black listed ericshmerick What defines "as soon as?" 5 minutes after purchase? 1 week? 2.8 months? 3 years? marcusmarcus2 Do we have confirmation that it is only those phones that were black listed? Could they have inadvertently black listed other phones from fi? EarlyMon The TOS say that commercial resale is not allowed and lots of them were resold by a private company in a scheme that tried to avoid sales tax. Santos Chavez It actually does say that isn't allowed, hence why they initially banned several accounts the first time. It was a breach of their TOS, and it still is. It's likely Project Fi saw these phones as stolen and blacklisted them. james fuston "You may only purchase Devices for your personal use. You may not commercially resell any Device, but you may give the Device as a gift." So if you purchase the device and resell it in New (unopened) condition, yeah. Fi could also pretty easily make the case that if you purchased the phone and turned around to sell it before the expiry of the original installment plan that you had purchased it with the intention of reselling. MisterAlex That's still not a commercial sale. If I go to the store, buy a Nintendo Switch, and immediately list it as a brand new Switch on Craigslist, I'm not a commercial seller. I'm still an individual selling something that's fully within my "first sale" rights to sell. james fuston Yeah, that's true if you're reading the second, and only the second, sentence there. The first one pretty clearly states "You may only purchase Devices for your personal use" MisterAlex If you think that reselling a personally owned item goes beyond the bounds of personal use, you're kidding yourself (and so is anyone who thinks that line of thinking would hold water, legally speaking). First Sale is a very broad consumer protection, my friend. Once you buy something of your own, you can do whatever you want with it, including sell it. (Edit: in the States, anyway.) james fuston Yep! Totally fine for you to sell it. Also totally fine for Google to deactivate your phone when you've done something you agreed not to do at the time of purchase. It's then legally on you to prove that they overstepped. MisterAlex You're clearly not parsing what I'm posting. Selling privately owned property is within the bounds of "personal use." james fuston Seeing as Google specifically included a clause about gifting, I'd venture to say they disagree with you. MisterAlex That's fine. Sony also disagreed that it had done anything wrong by removing Other OS. james fuston Cool! So we agree that whether or not you believe Google's terms of service to be legal, it's entirely on the customer to take action after being penalized for a violation of said terms of service. MisterAlex It's always up to the wronged party to seek litigation against a wrongdoer. james fuston In that case, I have no idea why you started commenting on legality when I was discussing terms of service violations. Rather, I would have no idea why if this weren't the comment section. MisterAlex A TOS is not a legally binding agreement. You defended enforcement of a TOS when that enforcement went contrary to law. That's why I brought up the comparison to Sony's PS3 lawsuit (which it lost). james fuston I'm not discussing whether terms of service are legally binding. I'm discussing whether or not the action being described (selling the phone) violates the ToS. It does. MisterAlex And my counter was to point out that putting something in a TOS doesn't make it hunky-dory. In fact, it's quite possible for a TOS to violate law. As I've illustrated. bekifft This is where America is so great. Even if the TOS is unenforceable by law, it is technologically enforceable, obviously. So they do it anyway, and now the onus is on you the little guy to get the multinational corporation to knock it off. Vape John most likely carrier issues the blacklisting... so project fi is the culprit psychic99 More profit? The sell them $150 below market rates. That is not free. I don't know what is actually going on but I would suspect that the original owner did something wrong or unethical. To be honest Google's systems are weird. I ported out my nexus5x and it took them almost 3 months to Bill me for the remainder. So maybe the original person cancelled their card, played games with DPP, activated it for one day and did it again. And again. xyz Fortunately, you can just buy an iPhone and get top notch support. hunter2 So the answer is to buy everything new and toss the old device in the landfill? Kind of sad to see how people just roll over and let over-reaching companies basically decimate the second hand market so they can increase their profits. Jay Never said that and you know it. I said this is the risk you take.. It's as simple as that. trixnkix637 That's the risk you take for not buying from reputable sources. Buying used has risks. Sucks he found out the hard way. jb0nez But the article says it's not Google, it's the carrier who blacklisted. Whatever that means... hunter2 That makes no sense. The carrier technically blocks that IMEI on their network, but only after another carrier submits it to the blacklist. It would be like if you SWATTED somebody and then said "it was the police who came to your house with guns not me". pfmiller On top of that this seems like an abuse of the blacklisting system. The system is intended to discourage theft, not as a means for companies to get revenge on their customers. psychic99 That's not true. Companies have been blacklisting devices for years if tos wasn't met. I have bought 3 phones through fi and they are heavily discounted. Google doesn't do that for free they expect you to activate them on fi for more than one day. Also if you are buying a phone from an individual and not a dealer you are taking a risk straight up. I have had friend have their phones blacklisted when they have bought phones from people and then they turned around and reported them as stolen. Swappa is a marketplace not a arbitrator. They are facilitating a sale. You guys need to know the difference. PayPal is your friend. hunter2 That's dumb. The whole point of cancellation fees is to re-coup the cost of subsidies if you break the contract. By going a different route, the only people who are getting punished are the people buying these phones. psychic99 Lots of people don't pay them and I have seen numerous accounts where friends have bought phones and have told me they got a "deal of a lifetime" to find their devices blacklisted and guess what they were people who never paid off their termination fees or have sold them then reported them stolen. And as an individual you need to take responsibility, if you purchase anything through a private transaction you should ask for poof of sale, do they own it, have it put in writing, etc. That way if the seller does something illegal then you have a remedy. This doesn't derisk anything tho. This is good education for people, to know where responsibility lies and the risks of buying from an individual versus an established dealer. In the case of Swappa, you should buy via Paypal, so there is a remedy. You can chargeback your loss if this happens within 6 months (I have done this will unethical sellers), so they are not being punished they are being inconvenienced. But that is the RISK you take buying from an individual. hunter2 I know you want to see Google as the good guy here, but within these comments there are accounts from people who bought outright, and months later sold their Pixel's and now months after that sale are being contacted by the seller about the device being blacklisted. bekifft I think you're missing his point. It's not about Google being the good or bad guy, it's that buying something third party is inherently risky and he's right, you should ask for a chain of evidence that proves the device is legit. Maybe I'm also just tired of people claiming they can find things so cheap online, when most of it is scams like this, and just devalues the whole market. hunter2 You need to look through these comments. There are people here who bought their phones directly from Fi and after switching carriers their fully paid off phones have been blacklisted. They were the original owners and these phones were never sold. There are also people here who bought phones, used them for months, and sold them after they were fully paid off. These people are saying that the proper they sold the phones to are now coming back and telling them they're blacklisted. bekifft In that case that is indeed disturbing. I am a Fi subscriber though I bought my phone direct from the Google store. Sounds like someone made a big mistake on the back end. Lance Biddle I bought my phone from Project Fi, and it has become blacklisted after changing to another carrier. Google is definitely the bad guy right now IMO pfmiller Just because other companies have been doing it, doesn't mean that it's not an abuse of the system. It's clearly not what the blacklisting system was intended for. Lance Biddle How about when you buy the phone from Project Fi, decide to switch carriers and the phone you outright own becomes black listed. I cannot connect to the Verizon service I'm paying for. And Verizon cannot do anything about. And Google/Project Fi isn't. I've wasted way too much time on the phone trying to get this resolved. They have told me it could be 2-5+ days to get it fixed. WTF!! Never Google again. Never. J.J. I'm sorry. That sucks hard. ProductFRED Considering the original seller probably isn't going to pay people back, all Google did was fuck over a bunch of legitimate customers. iPhone reselling is also a big issue, especially on new releases, but you don't see Apple doing this. J.J. Agree 💯. Most of these customers involved (who probably have had hardware and software issues already on top​ of this) will never buy a pixel again! Cassidy James Blaede Just for the record, the majority of Pixel users likely never have hardware or software issues. I, my mom, and a couple of my friends have Pixels and haven't had any issues. You probably hear about issues on Reddit a lot because the only reason to visit the Pixel subreddit is to complain. 🙃 Jordan L no issues here too. J.J. Not a redditer lol, but many other sites show the issues(as low as they may be) and if you were on the fence about spending that kind of money, these stories alone may sway many Duder12 Yep. Just like iphone touch disease and early shutdowns. Tr3ple Never had those issues. xyz That's true. I personally don't know anyone who has been murdered. Therefore, no one gets murdered. Cassidy James Blaede I'd wager that the majority of people don't get murdered. 😉 Written Description My Pixel XL has performed flawlessly since its purchase and it's my first Android phone after using every iPhone from the first generation on. Google's AI is better, its cloud storage is infinitely better, and I don't see going back to Apple anytime soon. J.J. I'm glad you have not had issues.... Others however have Duder12 Not me. Corey Kinard 3rd Np. Duder12 Mines been great... atl3630 great here too. Cael Apple is not a "carrier". ProductFRED Neither is Google. They just use other carriers' networks. Either way, that isn't justification for what they're doing. Unless they plan on replacing everyone's Pixel (which looks like a hard no), they fucked over a lot of legitimate customers. I buy my devices off of swappa most of the time. Tell me how I would get this fixed if neither the seller nor Google want to take responsibility. marcusmarcus2 Google is an MVNO. Per https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-an-mvno-cell-phone-carrier-578673 "An MVNO is a cell phone carrier (such as a prepaid wireless carrier) that typically does not have its own network infrastructure and licensed radio spectrum" Apple is not even an MVNO carrier. drksilenc fi is a carrier... JD With Fi Google is a Carrier. Mitch Gray This just happened to my fiance's phone. I bought it on swappa for her birthday months ago because Google store didn't have any in stock and this morning it is blacklisted. I'm so furious. I have had every Google phone since the Galaxy Nexus and because of this policy I will never buy another phone of theirs. She is now stranded without a phone and has no way of using it for work at the busiest time of the year for her (she is a teacher and it's graduation week). Who do I contact about this? We shouldn't be punished because someone gamed the system. J.J. I feel so bad for you. I hope you get it resolved. This is an atrocity! J.J. Should definitely hassle fi/Google and let them know if they don't resolve you will never buy and tell everyone you know not to buy and so on jibust No, stop don't tell them that, they might not withstand the shock of loosing them. /S T4rd I would contact the seller of the phone and/or Swappa if they're the service you went through. If they're no help somehow, then contact Paypal if that's how you paid for it. Google isn't going to unblacklist the phone regardless of what you say to them. It's virtually impossible for a phone to be unblacklisted once it has happened, so you're going to have to just get a refund and buy another phone. A Person Good luck with that. I am hesitant to ever buy again from Swappa.. and I used to love, love, love them. I purchased a device that was blatantly not as described. I then contacted Swappa and they instructed me that it is now between me and the seller. So I contacted the seller via the sale page and was basically told: "ummmm, nah". datkidpatrick at that point you could have went thru paypal and filed a claim... T4rd That's why you buy from reputable sellers. The few minor issues I've had on there were resolved quickly. atl3630 yes, same here. To date I've never had a swappa problem that didn't get resolved and the people have been very helpful. Don't blame swappa for shitty sellers. Buy from reputable sellers (like me). yankeesusa Swappa only helps communicating. To resolve any issues you must file a PayPal claim. datkidpatrick contact the seller and see if they can contact project fi/google... King_Android Ijs, BBB is an extremely powerful tool in order to get your voice heard from Corporate asap...... Stephen Hicks If the phone is under warranty still, file an RMA claim and state the bluetooth isn't working correctly on the device and that you've already tried factory resetting the phone as well as reconnected all the bluetooth devices with no improvement. Might work? njn There is no warranty for second hand phones. JRock I purchased a bootlooping 6P off eBay for cheap, erasing/flashing firmware had same result, RMA'd to Huawei and they promptly sent me a brand new one. Mark Depending on the credit card you used to buy the phone, you might have an extended warranty that might cover this. atl3630 You can get your money back. Contact the seller through swappa and tell them the issue. They will likely tell you it's been to long, I don't care, etc. If so, then file a PayPal claim. You have six months PayPal protection. Document that the phone no longer works and send it back to the seller with tracking. Then PayPal will refund you money, no matter what the seller says. M3D1T8R But doing this will just end up screwing over the seller. PayPal will simply take the money from their account and refund it to the buyer. So that's not fair to the seller either. PayPal's "seller protection" is a fraud. And their customer service is a total joke. They should be boycotted. atl3630 How does that screw over the seller? The seller screwed himself when he sold the phone. His beef is with ProjectFi, not the buyer. Frankly the buyer shouldn't have to deal with this crap since buyers have no way to determine the history of a phone. The seller sold a phone that stopped working. That's on them. M3D1T8R Because, obviously, the seller doesn't necessarily know the history and every previous owner of every phone. What if it's a phone someone bought previously used. They used it for a while just fine, and resold it. Then this IMEI block thing happened. atl3630 Yeah, that would suck. But still, it's not the buyer's fault. If something happens and somebody gets cheated out of $500+ then you better bet people are going to exercise whatever option they can to recover their money. PayPal protection would do that for them in the first 6 months. ericshmerick So anyone who sells a phone is on the hook for its functionality until the end of time? GTFO of here with that. It's ridiculous and you know it. atl3630 Six months, moron. PayPal protection is 6 months. Like it or not, facts. Stop being a little bitch. Roh_Mish What if the seller had bought directly from google. AP mentioned about the trains but there doesn't appear to to be a link between this and that fraud. Also there are many cases where buyer on PayPal will request a reverse and never return the product, screwing over the seller. And PayPal won't do anything about this. vn33 That really sucks .. .especially to someone near and dear to you. I would be beyond furious! Hope everything works out!! Duder12 Swappa will cover you here. You are fine. Get the ball rolling. Anwar Imraan Lucas To me it seems that the original buyer had reported his credit card lost or stolen and is disputing charges on his card which in terms maybe blacklisting those devices as stolen.. blindexecutioner You do Google the service of endless beta testing their software on a way overpriced phone and they blacklist you. Nice. Lawrence Good, that is what you get for buying the Bezel XL ericshmerick OH YOUUUU!!1 theadamsegal Yet another reason I will not buy a Google device again. Tiberian For the record: Kyle Bennett is the owner and founder of HardOCP, not just a simple writer for the site. ;) Richard Gao Did not know that. Thanks! datkidpatrick this happened by to me as well... i sold my pixel 3 months ago and the buyer just informed me it was blacklisted... i had no clue project fi was doing this and legit thought the buyer was trying to scam me... i contacted project fi support and was advised it was escalated to be removed from the blacklist... i paid off the phone before i sold it... this is definitely a mistake by google/project fi... they should be correcting this soon... Jordan L Can a carrier just randomly blacklist IMEIs?! I guess so. I was reading this thread thinking 'well, people probably just bought a stolen Pixel unknowingly' but your case proves this wrong. Navneet Suresh Shitty move Google ! :/ Jay If this happened to me, I'd just return the phone to the seller, get refunded, and make them have to deal with this. Swappa made a huge fucking deal about refunding buyers after the Note7 debacle and it should be the same thing here. freshprince_87 I hope that Kyle guy reads your comment. This may help him Jay Honestly, Swappa needs to be pushing this harder. I sold my Note7 last year and despite the fact that the buyer could have gone and gotten the refund from T-Mobile themselves, they chose to take Swappa up on their suggestion of getting the refund from me. (Add to this that Swappa said if I didn't agree to the refund, they'd "suggest" the buyer take the issue up with PayPal as the device was not sold as advertised. Seriously..) datkidpatrick it isn't the sellers fault... and its something that can be fixed... Jay I fail to see how this isn't the seller's fault for trying to game the system and make a profit. This sure as hell isn't Google's fault.. so who do you want to blame then? The unsuspecting buyers? datkidpatrick it is googles fault... the point they referred to in november is completely separate from the issue happening now... the issue happening now is many pixel phones that were sold and originated from fi is getting blacklisted... i sold my pixel after paying it of legit and it just got blacklisted... now please tell me how i tried to game the system... Jay For all I know, you could be one of those shady scalpers too who tried to make a profit by gaming the system. The burden of fixing this issue should still lie on the sellers. If someone wants their money back, they have every right to make you do the legwork of figuring out how you'll make your money back. datkidpatrick I contacted project fi for the buyer and it is escalated... again the point is it wasn't my fault... marcusmarcus2 If you are just trying to sell 1 phone that you got and paid for without trying to "game the system" it is not your fault, but it is your responsibility as the seller to try and resolve the issue, which it sounds like you are doing. Who's fault is it? Hard to tell until Google releases a comment about why this is happening. Did they block these by mistake? Then it is Googles fault. Are they doing it to block the bulk buyers that were "gaming the system" and just went over board and blocked some extra phones that were not part of those that gamed the system? Then it would be the fault of Google and those that gamed the system that caused Google to make the choice. hunter2 I wouldn't say it's his responsibility. He's selling a device. If the maker of that device decides to flip a kill switch in 18 months and disable every device out there then why blame him. Google is flipping a kill switch an all kinds of devices (just below there is a comment from a guy who bought and paid for his phone, then later switched carriers and had his originally bought phone killed). Trying to blame middle men here is crazy. marcusmarcus2 I'm not blaming the seller. Please re-read. I said the fault is with Google if they are the ones that decided to black list them. It is the sellers responsibility to try figure out why a device they sold is blacklisted. If they did nothing wrong, then they should be able to get it unblacklisted by working with Google. From the looks of some of the comments on here, it looks like the buyer would not be able to get the device of the black list but the seller should be able to. Again, I'm not blaming the middle man. There is a difference between fault and responsibility. Fault sounds like it is fully on Google. Responsibility goes across everyone though with some having more responsibility. Buyer has some responsibility to report the issue to the seller instead of just reporting it to paypal. Seller has more responsibility than the seller because they would be the one who would be able to work with Google/fi to get it off the black list. Google/fi would have even more responsibility to explain why devices are being blacklisted and getting devices off the black list if they should not be on there. Max As a somewhat frequent seller/buyer on Swappa and Ebay I can say that this is definitely the sellers responsibility to fix the problem or promptly accept a return for a refund otherwise this isn't so different from a bait and switch situation. datkidpatrick how is it a bait and switch if i paid off a phone legit and decided to sell it after... 3 months later it gets blacklisted... this is a mistake by google and its their responsibility to fix... Max If you paid off the phone legit and didn't do anything shady then it wouldn't have been blacklisted and if it was you, as the original buyer, are the one with more authority to contact Google, not the second hand buyer, therefore it's your responsibility to fix it. The buyer with a blacklisted phone has zero reasons to believe that you were truthful in your description even if you were. datkidpatrick well i did contact project fi for the buyer and it is escalated... Max Then you're doing the right thing (taking responsibility) and hopefully this gets resolved quickly by Fi! Although I don't know if they can just un-blacklist a phone? Hopefully they can. ericshmerick If I buy a product from a retail store and 92 days later it has an issue, guess what they will tell me when I show up barking for a refund? Yeah, pound sand kid. That's what they will say. So why do Swappa sellers suddenly have the responsibility to refund forever ala Costco? I get people are pissy at the situation, but the seller isn't responsible for Google's shadyness here. Max We're not talking about "an issue" here because that's what warranties are for, we're talking about a phone reported as lost/stolen after being sold this could potentially mean a fraudster that didn't fully pay the phone or a thief that sold a stolen phone, I doubt any serious retailer would do that... By the way that's what buyer protections are for, Paypal has six months of protection and credit card providers can be very flexible if you explain your case well and you're in the right. If a retailer pull something like this they would never win a chargeback. Max We're not talking about "an issue" here because that's what warranties are for, we're talking about a phone reported as lost/stolen after being sold this could potentially mean a fraudster that didn't fully pay the phone or a thief that sold a stolen phone, I doubt any serious retailer would do that... By the way that's what buyer protections are for, Paypal has six months of protection and credit card providers can be very flexible if you explain your case well and you're in the right. If a retailer pull something like this they would never win a charge back and the manufacturer and distributor would never be involved in the original transaction or charge back, it would be up to the retailer to go after the manufacturer or distributor. ericshmerick But nothing shady or illegal is going on here. If I and the original buyer and I use it on project fi for two months, then decide to sell it. How does that suddenly implicate me as being some sort of shady criminal? I would simply be selling a legally purchased piece of hardware that was paid in full. Max Can you please elaborate how the buyer knows that you sold "a legally purchased piece of hardware that was paid in full" if he has a blacklisted phone reported as lost/stolen in the hands? Good luck convincing the buyer, Paypal and a Bank that you're in the right in such a situation... Luxferro If they sold you shady (stolen or not legal) products you'd be dealing with them. tnt These are not devices being bought from an official retailer. There's no need to question the history of a device bought from Costco. Swappa (and Ebay and Craigslist for that matter) are not the same type of market. It's the seller's responsibility to know the history (as much as possible anyway) of the devices they're selling. freshprince_87 I guess it's safer to buy a Verizon Google Pixel instead if you intend on reselling it later. So the future buyer isn't screwed by Google. That is such a ridiculous policy drksilenc have to have a line with verizon to do that though. Wendell Brown Apparently not, this dude says his WERE Verizon phones that were locked.... https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/6d2yse/2_of_my_3_google_pixel_phones_blacklisted_on_the/ Me Google is just shooting themselves in the foot at this point with the Pixel Yan Qin I just sold my Pixel XL and switch to Galaxy S8, I do think I was out of my mind that I actually bought Pixel at full price. Jordan L anyone resell a project fi phone NOT through Swappa and have it blacklisted? maybe ProjectFi blacklisted only Swappa phones(still a strange move if it was on purpose) Jagermeister 2 of my 3 Pixel phones showed up blacklisted 2 days ago. I made a reddit post yesterday of my issue. I though it was part of an insurance fraud scam. https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/6d2yse/2_of_my_3_google_pixel_phones_blacklisted_on_the/ I had originally though our phones were from Verizon not Google Fi. We were happy Pixel customers that are now considering purchasing different phones because Google can report as stolen whenever they feel a Google Fi device was not transferred to a new owner per their TOS. How can any user purchasing a pre-owned or "new" Google Pixel be sure that it isn't a Google Fi device and won't be blacklisted in the future? Max Johnson Note to self, don't buy second hand Google devices. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Note to everyone: Don't buy first hand Google devices. Max Why? Mine works perfectly fine and so far it's the best phone I've ever owned. Dana Yeah, it's fine as long as you don't get it from Project Fi because you can't sell it if you want to upgrade to a new device. Max LOL, what? I simply bought it directly from store.google.com, no issues here and I can provide proof. This is something related to phones sold through Fi. hunter2 Congrats, scroll up one comment and you'll find a guy who's phone is blacklisted despite him being the original owner and being fully paid off. To answer your question of "Why", it's because not everyone is as comfortable gambling with their money as you are. Max 1) It was blacklisted by the carrier, not the manufacturer. 2) It was blacklisted after it was resold, sucks but as far as we know it doesn't affect the original seller, there's a difference there. 3) We don't know yet why this really happened. 4) Even with all of the above, I don't see how it fits in a "Don't buy first hand Google devices." statement. Maybe if you tell me "Don't deal with Project Fi service" I could somewhat agree. hunter2 http://disq.us/p/1iz7ts3 Sorry, should have permalinked the comment since the order is moving per votes. That guy was the original owner and claims to have been paid off. Moved to Verizon at some point and had the device he originally bough directly from Google blacklisted. Max Well that negates my point 2 and sucks even more. But still the blame here points 100% to Project Fi and not the phone itself nor Google as the manufacturer of the phone. Something really strange is happening with Project Fi devices and hopefully they will find out soon if it's an error, incompetence, sabotage or maybe even hacking. hunter2 I guess it depends on how willing you are to absolve the parent company of things a specific branch is doing. It would be like saying "don't blame MS, it's the IE team who makes the browser" during the IE6 days. Max Legally is evident that the responsibility is on Google but if you think that the group in charge of designing and manufacturing the Pixel has any minimal clue about what happens inside the group of the MVNO Project Fi then you're frankly clueless about how such a huge company works. By the way IE and Edge sucks but Visual Studio rocks and I'm liking more Windows 10 recently but I guess I should avoid using everything Microsoft because IE really sucks, right? hunter2 If a decisions like these can be made without going far enough up the chain of command that you're dealing with some higher ups, then I don't really want to know how this company runs. It's enough to tell me that I can't really trust them because you can't really depend on a company keeping in line with their corporate ideals when individual units can work with this much impunity. Avoiding/disliking MS was never about IE sucking. It was about IE being openly hostile and damaging to the web. This complaint was obviously projected at Microsoft themselves since no one believed that the IE team was working in a bubble. I don't know how old you are so maybe you weren't around when all this was going on. It's not about disliking a company because one or some of their many products are inferior. It's about disliking them because they employ user hostile tactics and you don't feel like you can support that (or at the very least want to punish them in the tiny way you can by voting with your wallet). Max So you already got an official response from Google about this? Can you share it? Because so far I have only read guesses about what is happening and nothing official yet. I'm old enough to have used MS-DOS 5 & 6 as well as Windows 3.1. That doesn't change the fact that saying "don't buy anything from a company" based on one division issues is just silly. If Google officially says that all of this was planned then maybe you could have a point, until then you're just stretching facts to prove a weak point. hunter2 I don't need to fill in the facts. I'm saying either way it's bad. The facts are that this happened. Additional facts about why it happened are irrelevant Max Well, if you're happy thinking like that be my guest, I guess some people is unable to see the colors and think the world is black and white. hunter2 For people whom this isn't a mundane thought experiment but are actually in a position where they need to buy a new device (not everyone is able to be without their phone until Google ultimately resolves this); the shades of gray in this scenario don't change their circumstances. The facts are that they have a phone that was remotely disabled. I'm assuming your shades of gray are the how's and why's of that? How is that of any consequence to these people? Steve_Jobroni Shut up, troll. DanSan got em! Matt This will be great for their resale value. ericshmerick Swappa comments: I GEEVE U $200 BUY NOW FINAL OFFERS!! JD Wooooo! Go Pixel, I'm definately not going near any Google hardware with a 1000ft pole now.I may use my 1001ft pole. In Many states, and at least in Canada this is not legal, you can't blacklist a phone for ToS violation. There's a very narrow list of reasons for a device to be blacklisted. Cuong This is a really shitty move from Google. At least sent a notification few days in advance and offer a way to appeal. What if a person was in an emergency situation? Imagine the lawsuit for that, Google. Why customers have to suffer because Google can't control their resellers? ericshmerick 911 always works. segag Thats Fuck all! Snowsky Mountain This may seriously make me rethink my use of Google hardware (especially phones). Stevie Do no evil Google. Do no evil. My Dixie Wrecked Yeah, they got rid of that mandate years ago. Seriously. Look it up. mxwp lol, yeah it was pretty funny. but i give Big G props for being somewhat honest about that. "hmm, we're huge now and so just cannot help to do some evil" Corey Kinard Just looked​ it up. Looks like it's still in place for Google. Alphabet's is different l though. It's "do the right thing." Sruly J Bought an unlocked Pixel yesterday for $334. Before I send it in to get checked and fixed by Google, I really should check the IMEI (normally I'd have the IMEI first, but the seller didn't give it to me). Michael D’Ambrosio "Someone with an answer." That'll get you far with Tech support. Smh vn33 Does the blacklisted phone works out of US, say in Canada? I assume yes, if it's the carriers that are doing the blacklisting. that said, it would really dampen my desire for a phone from Google. Stevie I am crossing my fingers that they don't come after my Nexus 6. Already bought and activated. There's no going back right? speedy1979 So to clarify google is randomly blacklisting any google pixel that is resold. I actually considered buying a ProjectFi device sometime ago; so glad I didn't go through with it. Kris Crowley I have fi service. When you buy a phone through fi you got a discount or a phone that you can't get through the Google store if you want. There is a disclaimer that if you buy it and never activate it that you will be charged additional Monies within 30 days. Now without knowing isn't possible that A the phone was bought at a discount and B the additional fee was levied but never paid? trixnkix637 Know the risks of buying used people. Do your homework. Asking where the seller bought the phone originally could've prevented all of this. Can't blame Google because someone tried to game the system both ways. marcusmarcus2 Know the risks of not using commas, people. You should never buy people, whether they are used or new. Rony Hmmm, is there a difference between a new and a used person. I've scoured the forums and haven't got a clear answer. marcusmarcus2 You would have to ask them before you buy them. They usually know when they've been used. But again, you should not buy any people. Def Ref But if you try to rent people, you start hearing words like "solicitation" and that's no fun. marcusmarcus2 Don't rent them either. While we are at it. Do not borrow, loan or steal people. Def Ref Is enticement allowed in your no fun world? Asking for a friend. marcusmarcus2 I don't see a problem with enticement as long as that enticement does not lead to stealing people. "No fun world"? You mean my world where I think people should not be viewed or treated as items/property? If yes, then yeah, I guess it is a no fun world. Def Ref Lighten up, Francis. marcusmarcus2 Lighten up, Francis? https://38.media.tumblr.com/39ef7347a58e308e67a5bd01cd124431/tumblr_nsld6lafvE1qh124lo1_500.gif Def Ref https://youtu.be/0OnpkDWbeJs That the title is misspelled AND mispunctuated is bonus. trixnkix637 Didn't NY and NV allow for the renting of people or is that wishful thinking? Asking for a friend. Rod This was so good, I had to sign into Disqus to upvote. trixnkix637 Buying people has been around for ages. Can't just stop now because of commas. marcusmarcus2 Buying used has been around for ages. trixnkix637 And so has it's risks. ericshmerick Wow I feel bad for the Swappa sellers who are getting PayPal charge backs right about now. Alexander Z Great This was the response I received. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/948da6656e25823e8dc529c4571fbc2d347f5e820ee9b7c91844d48c9745a112.png DanSan owner of the device ≠ person who purchased. way to go google. InnocentEd News flash this could happen with any phone from any manufacturer on any network that is resold used. I've had it happen with 2 iPhones and Apple could have cared less. You buy used, you take the risk. It's amazing how even credited tech journalists assume devices on Swappa are always going to be 100% safe. If Project Fi were not allowed to be resold via T&S then it's no diff than blacklisting a resold stolen phone...they had every right. Bewear This is why we can't have nice things. Rony Honestly this makes total sense. Its technically stealing the phone if you buy it for a discounted price and you dont activate it and sell it again. I think they made the right move. raffr It's not "technically" stealing. If you purchase a product at the price requested, you did not steal it. IF, big IF, in your purchase agreement it states you cannot resell the phone without activating it first, then google has a case. Serge Cebrian if you are paying for the service ... you are still paying for it even if you keep your older phone or a better phone if you want to unless you stop paying then its stealing ... but not if you keep the service// marcusmarcus2 They could have blacklisted these phones for that reason. But they could have also been overzealous when blacklisting devices and blacklisted numerous other devices that people did not do that with. It may have been the right move to block those that did do that, but if they inadvertently blocked additional devices, then hopefully they make the right move and unblock those devices that should not have been blocked. newtonfb Not new. Wife got a 5x on swappa. Phone was originally on FI but never taken off the account. We tried to activate it on FI but they did we couldn't until the owner released the phone? It worked fine on any other carrier. Had to get a new 5x Lance Biddle I paid off my pixel through project fi. I recently switched to Verizon. Yesterday Verizon notified me that my phone had been reported as stolen! When I awoke this morning my service had been disabled by Verizon. The support from Project Fi has been abysmal. What do I do to fix this? Corey Kinard Go to Reddit. Get ready for talks with the Better Business Bureau. Keep contacting Fi, keep screenshotting all the correspondences, you get all the buyers info in order to prove you are the original device owner. You don't fix this, you didn't cause it to break. Google fixes this. Everyone affected just has to light a fire under their ass. tnt Keep pushing / escalating with Project Fi. Ryan from GroupTweet I bought a Pixel from Tradeport USA (NH based company, shit!) about 3 months ago. The phone is on T-mobile right now and still currently working (fingers crossed). From my interpretation this appears only to be affecting Pixels bought through Google Fi - and perhaps not ones bought via Google Play store unlocked? Is that correct? Is there anyway I can check to see if my pixel was in fact sold via Google FI vs Google Play? Really hoping I don't wake up to a bricked phone in the next couple mornings... Sruly J You could contact Google, provide them with the IMEI, and they could let you know if it was bought through Google Play. Ryan from GroupTweet Thanks - but don't want to risk tipping them off that my phone should be on the blacklist :( Sruly J But wouldn't they know anyways if it should be blacklisted? I mean, how else would they have blacklisted so many phones this week? lauriedesautels So I have the Pixel and was planning on selling it via Swappa after my credits end from another phone. They ended up giving me a brand new Pixel XL but their service has become horrible where I live. So please correct me if I am wrong but if the Pixel is paid off and I switch carriers/ my Pixel is a paperweight? (I don't plan on using the phone on another carrier after 3 mo). ericshmerick According to this place, you can never sell it. You must carry it with you to your grave. Robert Montoya I have a Pixel that is currently blacklisted as of 5/23/2017 I bought it from Swappa... Google says they will lift the ban in 24 to 48 hours... That was 24 hours ago.. Phone still Blacklisted Wendell Brown I must have missed where it was shown that these deactivated phones were on Project Fi. As best I can tell, the only link to Fi is from an OLD article about the guy reselling phones several months ago. Is there any proof that this is in any way Fi related? MadJoe I have to say, if Google ever blacklisted my phone in a misguided sour-grapes attempt to punish the person who sold it to me, and without compensating me for it I would be rather angry. It would also be the absolute last Google product I ever purchased. As it is, this story has me glad I don't own anything more than a $25 Chromecast that I never use. I was seriously considering the Pixel 2 as my next phone, but not any more. If they were going to be such babies about the phones being resold, they should have vetted their buyers a little better. Corey Kinard It doesn't look like they were making any money off of you in the first place... Second-hand buyers/ bargain hunters rarely go out and pre-order $800 phones. Maybe you're different. They're definitely fucking up, but considering how little the pixel one sold and how much money they make I'm not sure they'll care about this any which way the wind blows. Same way Apple can just outright tell their customers to go fuck themselves over certain problems. MadJoe The problem is that too many people will ignore a company's unscrupulous behavior. If more of us would punished them by taking away access to our wallets, they'd think twice about trying to screw us. But people are lazy and lack commitment. So you're absolutely right, Google won't feel any hit by my deciding not to buy any more of their shit because a shit-ton of blind lemmings will gladly line up to jump off that spot on the cliff I chose not to use. And when a couple of them get screwed, they will cry "why isn't anyone else interested in helping me?" as the rest of the heard ignore them. On the bright side, the cycle will continue ad nauseum until I'm in a hole in the ground. Bruce Considering the ridiculous amount they are charging for the phones (Apple pricing without the Apple level support), this just about kills the resale value for a Pixel. Who the hell is going to buy a used phone for $500+ (because the original cost is so high) if their phones get blacklisted months later. And who the hell is going to buy the phones at the original price, when resale value will drop like a rock. And this doesn't even take into account all the BS that comes with the phone to begin with. 2 years of guaranteed OS updates. Hardware issues (Bluetooth, speakers, water resistance...) which don't get acknowledged amid finger pointing. Insufficient inventory even if they were open to replacements. The 128GB version (the 32GB is too little and the 64 GB doesn't exist) costs almost a $1000. The first time they tried this with the Nexus One, it didn't go well. This doesn't seem to be going much better. The Galaxy Nexus couldn't be upgraded because of drivers. The only real hits have been the Nexus 5 and the 6P. UniBroW *clutches iPhone 7 plus despite it's inferiority to android* Tj Hariharan Wait, do we actually KNOW that the phones that are blacklisted were originally purchased for reselling for profit? All i got from this article was that the phone was originally purchased from Project Fi.. RTNDO128 My phone was effected by this. I've been having issues with no T-Mobile service for the past couple of days on Project Fi. After reading this article, I used the Swappa IMEI checker and what do you know, my phone is reported "lost/stolen". I bought my Pixel on eBay at the beginning of January. Now I'm beyond their 30 day gaurentee. What an absolute clusterfuck. RTNDO128 My phone was effected by this. I've been having issues with no T-Mobile service for the past couple of days on Project Fi. After reading this article, I used the Swappa IMEI checker and what do you know, my phone is reported "lost/stolen". I bought my Pixel on eBay in the middle of February. Now I'm beyond their 30 day guarantee. What an absolute clusterfuck. Y2J You have 180 days in Paypal. RTNDO128 Thanks, I filed a claim with them. Hopefully this situation is covered. Max Did you contact first the seller? Otherwise it's a dick move to file a claim without first giving the seller the opportunity to see if he collaborates... RTNDO128 Thanks for your opinion. As stated, I'm beyond the 30 day eBay guarantee window. I created a "dispute" through the PayPal Resolution Center, which sends a message directly to the seller. PayPal is totally uninvolved with the dispute until I choose to escalate, which will only happen if I cannot get this resolved with the seller first. I just want to have our conversations documented in the event that the seller does not want to deal with this situation. Ken Kinda weird Google said that IMEI can't be blocked by manufacturer, I'm sure that's true. But what when manufacturer is also technically the carrier? Da_James Are you saying that "buying" a device in the USA doesn't mean you own it? Just SUE. Steve_Jobroni > as it's the carrier and not the manufacturer that has the ability to blacklist devices Do people not read the full article anymore? There seems to be a lot of Jabroni's blaming Google when it's the carrier that can only do the blacklisting. Sir_Brizz But that carrier is Project Fi, aka Google... Aleksandr Ivanov Change IMEI, problem solved! AbdulB1 lol Cassidy James Blaede I'd be interested in hearing how widespread this actually is, and a response from Google. My mom bought a Pixel from Swappa because Google was out of stock, and she's been loving it. I'd hate for her phone to become a brick because of this. Leonardo Baez I see a class action demand on the horizon? Đức Thành I'm a die-hard Google fan, but wow does Google need some fixing. justmy2pennies2012 There is one simple way Google can prevent the second hand market from making a profit. 1. Provide enough stock for all those who want to purchase the device! :) Bonus: Price the device accrodingly!! I gave up trying to buy one new from VZW and the Play Store.

RayNeverLearns I believe Project Fi has done this for all affected Pixels. I didn't contact the person who sold it to me (Craigslist 7 months ago... wouldn't know where to even start) yet my phone was whitelisted earlier today. A little pain and it took almost 3 days, but a good resolution. datkidpatrick thats great... happy it's fixed... Amir What an idiotic move by Google. That's suicide.

Opinion: Even if you can, you probably shouldn't buy a Google Pixel anymore David Ruddock Follow View All Posts 2017/05/01 2:09pm PDTMay 1, 2017 111 Plus 1 on G+ 379 Share on Facebook 108 Share on Twitter Total Shares598 Editorials Pixel Pixel XL The Google Pixel is a notoriously hard phone to get a hold of. Persistent stock issues have plagued Google's first "in-house" handset from day one, and things really are little to no better six months after the launch event. Honestly, it's a bit embarrassing just how consistently incompetent Google seems to be at keeping a reasonable inventory of phones available for purchase. But setting that aside, as one of the Pixel's most ardent evangelists, I think there's something it's probably time for me to come clean on: Even if you could buy a Pixel today, I really think you shouldn't. The Pixel is a product with generation-one product issues. The Bluetooth performance is horrid. It's not waterproof. The bezels really are due for a shrink. I don't think the exterior coating on the black and blue variants is of a particularly high quality. The glass window gets scuffed up incredibly easily. The Snapdragon 821 is officially old news. And it doesn't support proper advanced network features across all four of the big US carriers. There are other flaws I could point to, and while none of them are too terrible, they do speak to the slightly-rushed development cycle this phone seems to have been subjected to. Sure, Google got some things astoundingly right: the performance, the camera, the larger software experience. In fact, I think the Pixel is easily the best Android smartphone ever for these strengths, at least if we're talking about me personally as a user (your mileage, obviously, may vary). But for all the great, smooth, fast, clean, pure, simple, natural, and various other adjective-members singing in the Pixel-praise cavalcade, this phone is not the one to buy right now. For starters, Google continues to ask what is an increasingly laughable amount of money for the model most of us want - the 128GB XL - at a staggering $870. Sure, Apple charges the same for an iPhone 7 Plus 128GB, but I'm under no illusion that this comparison in any way favors Google. The iPhone comes with Apple customer service (with actual stores), a longer software support period going forward, and runs no real risk of poor resale value. The Pixel? Google's online support is iffy at best, we know the phone will be unsupported by October 2018, and I have a strong feeling generation-one Pixel resale values will drop like a rock once the new phones are announced. And that really is why, if you haven't pulled the trigger on a Pixel yet, you should just wait. It's overpriced, under-supported, and competing phones like the Galaxy S8 offer a whole lot more technology for your money. The Galaxy S8+ is $20 less than a 128GB Pixel XL, and I would argue it is far and away the better smartphone value. That amazing display, brand-new Snapdragon 835 processor, jaw-dropping design and packaging, and the full support of all our American carriers' latest LTE advancements could each be a reason on its own to put the Galaxy S8 above Google's smartphone. Do I still prefer using the Pixel over the S8? Sure. But I wouldn't buy a 128GB Pixel XL over a Galaxy S8+ today. That would be, frankly, a bit silly. If Google was asking $670 and not $870, the discussion would probably change, but they aren't. You've got to pay full price, and there's no way I could recommend anyone do that. If you're still on the fence about the Pixel, let me try to push you over: wait for the next generation. I realize that this sort of thinking can devolve into a rationale that encourages you to never upgrade anything because something newer, faster, and better is constantly on the horizon. But in this case, I think it's a consideration that is worth weighing more seriously than usual. Many of the Pixel's biggest flaws relate to Google's inexperience producing a smartphone. Issues that only come up as you try to mass-produce and distribute a product with a real marketing campaign that creates real demand, and the phone gets into the hands of "real" users who aren't part of the now-derailed Nexus phone hypetrain. Inside Google, expectations were no doubt managed, realities realized, and priorities accordingly re-calibrated after this first launch. (Side note: if the Bluetooth performance on the next Pixel is as bad as the first one, I may scream, Google.) Meanwhile, the things that make the Pixel great aren't going anywhere. The next Pixel will be fast, it will take great photos, and it will offer a wonderfully unfettered Android experience. Those that make it less than great? Google is no doubt drilling down through the worst of them in order to ensure the Pixel 2 - or whatever it's called - won't make the same mistakes that the original did (waterproofing, please). And one of the primary reasons to try the Pixel in the first place - to be on the very bleeding edge - really only remains true from a software standpoint. Older phones like the Nexus 5X and 6P don't even let the Pixel have an advantage there, as they're on the same update track until around the time the next Pixel phones launch. If you absolutely need a smartphone soon and the Pixel is tempting you, ask yourself this: Can you deal with a Moto G5 Plus for six months if it means having a better Pixel down the road? While as a reviewer I have the admitted luxury of not needing to consider such things, were I in such a position, I'd have little in the way of a counterargument to offer. Sure, you'll take a resale hit on anything you buy now, but the Pixel is going to face a much, much steeper devaluation curve in that time than any budget phone. Buying a Pixel right now just doesn't make sense. I love my Pixel XL, but I'm officially done recommending the phone to friends and relatives. Instead, I'll tell them to wait, or to get the Galaxy S8 they were probably going to buy anyway. Tags editorial google pixel google pixel xl opinion pixel xl subscribe ...

What's wrong with it? I haven't really noticed issues on my 128 non XL. I still love my phone but I understand if someone was switching now, they should just wait for the new one. I probably will. Patruns The XL is too large for me. No wireless charging is a game stopper for me. $650+ is just too much to pay as I buy my phones outright for my wife and myself. We are still happily using our Nexus 5 phones until something of roughly the same dimensions with QI charging comes out that won't break the bank. Also, I want pure Android. Not interested in Touchwiz or any other skins. Rod So, I found another proud N5 owner! I'm in my third battery, nothing to complain about. YuCMi I skipped this generation, was too salty about Google's treatment of Nexus devices. If they make their next phone reasonably priced, then I'll consider it. Otherwise, Google can fuck off with their "premium" pricing. CW The OnePlus 3T is a great phone at a great price! Laura J. Sellers Hughes I bought my Google Pixel XL for the camera. I have not been disappointed! https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/c44fd1bc546c27c02f945b075e0388e076c62e0fd612b3c74442129a05446139.jpg https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/c4618b9d22a1d44186f347c184038b3a833f38a1148cc4b91b95981303fa8b6b.jpg https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/465d23a781688e73e20a0737904c3880ee693ee06b5dd1779ae91d9799b0488b.jpg https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/1f3d76182fdd59b34eda695d20943d03e71240b775f63106ef41809601a7cabf.jpg https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/66175dfb8d6503940dc945b8d865f4f8276c84f7f3abd0e0e46dc31136501275.jpg https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/f7fa8ed860bc28a3a3e377a7e74591e764bdec5795747c4a1afb93eaa44aa0b2.jpg Rod You shouldn't. It's the best camera in a smartphone currently. Even the S8 was left behind in image quality. Aj Wayans Nothing wrong with my Pixel, best phone I've ever had. Only has scratches because I've dropped it a few times Rod Impossible. Pixel is horrid, every single owner has an urge to throw it onto the nearest wall. WNDRKND I hear ya, but I got pixel for Christmas. And back then, there was no new Samsung phone. Personally, the optimization alone makes the phone worth it... Like, I've literally had no problems. Even the speaker issue, Bluetooth, whatever. My handset works perfect, even for a first generation device. Either way, I'll be waiting for pixel three and skipping pixel 2 this Christmas. Rod I think you're 4 months late. Lol WNDRKND Haha perhaps, but with nobody able to get one... I still feel 9 months early lmao! Rod First rule of the Pixel club: no one talks about the club Hussain Ahmadi Pixel is an indie phone, like indie films with limited screens and very much less public appeal, no matter how good it is it will always be just a side phone. The only true big sharks in the market are Samsung and Apple. Google is not able to compete with them erikz The main reason I wanted the Pixel was to get on Google Fi. ackthbbft I think there are still good reasons to go with the Pixel, even if it means waiting for gen 2. I went with the Pixel because I wanted to get on Project Fi and "pure" Android. As a former Samsung Galaxy S5 user (S2 before that), I got tired of both carrier-installed and OEM bloatware, plus I've been saving money on my plan. Tj Hariharan Frankly I'm considering an LG-G6... comes with assistant, near stock android from what I've been told and my little experience with in-store demo's...AND iirc: an SD Card. Rod Then, when Google drops Android 8, you'll infuriated asking LG where your OTA is. gparmar76 Google will charge the same price with Pixel 2. They have a proven track record with the Nexus phones... roseglace >The Bluetooth performance is horrid. so? bluetooth is not everything to everyone. in particular, i've used it on my pixel exactly once. a non-issue. > It's not waterproof. i'll remember not to take my phone into the shower. another non-issue. > The bezels really are due for a shrink. the bezels i can't see with the phone in its case? > I don't think the exterior coating on the black and blue variants is of a >particularly high quality. the coating i can't see with the phone in its case? > The glass window gets scuffed up incredibly easily. there's that case in the way again. darn. > And it doesn't support proper advanced network features across all four >of the big US carriers. such as? maybe i'd worry if i lived in the united states but i bought the phone for phone calls, SMS and wifi. are those 'advanced'? they work in canada. > the model most of us want - the 128GB XL is there a shred of evidence that 'most' of 'us' want it? if it was the exact same price as the 16GB version i'd want it. if it was even twenty bucks more? umm, probably not. i know it's labelled 'opinion' and everything, but could you try a _little_ harder not to sound like you're whining? John Pitkethly I got a Pixel in December and have none of the problems listed in this article. Jordan Bartholme Great article, thank you! thereasoner If fast updates and performance are your thing than it's never a bad time to buy a Pixel but if one must wait then I guess the Pixel 2 is not that far off. Don't care about stock Android performance and updates? Then there are more choices coming still besides Samsung. I personally am looking forward to the HTC U 11 in a couple of weeks time. geolemon Good points. Even still, the worst point is that it's a metal (stupid) and glass (downright silly) wannabe iPhone (including all the hardware limitations we all hate Apple for) to try to pull the "Apple demographic" stereotype as a customer - people who want a jewelry phone rather than a functional, practical tool. Sadly, few alternatives exist today, if you want high end specs. How far we've fallen in just a few years. Hopefully it's something to just ride out - high end phones that fit in front trouser pockets and have swappable batteries, sd cards, and the durability of polycarbonate replacing the impact vulnerability of metal will reappear. But certainly - the Pixel is one of the more vulgar offerings. Sad, because I was otherwise a satisfied customer on Google Fi. Mike Dealbreaker on the Pixel 2 could be whether or not Google include unlimited full resolution Photos & Video BackUp like they have with the Pixel 1. If they don't & just throw in something like the S8's increased 100K Play Music songs limit instead, we just might hold on to our Pixel XL 128 a little longer instead. Like all hardware, it's what you do with it that really matters, but without the software to achieve it with... You just pays your money & you takes your choice. Notpoliticalyet Mate 9 is my Pixel XL. Easy to get one and top end specs. I have had all the Nexus phones and passed up the Pixel. I may look at the 2nd generation but they need to fix their supply chain. No reason to wait long with all of the good competition out there. They also created hype with limited availability. Get it right Google. Kimwo Good read! I've HATED my Pixel from day one! I tried to fall in love with it but I haven't! My husband made me do an upgrade and of course it was when this dumb a*$ ph came out! I sent my Samsung GalaxyS5 in as was required for rebate to get the Pixel. The camera sucks butt, I don't know what all the hype was about! I thought I'd like the fact it has unlimited storage but how is that useful if you can't get a good quality photo!!!! I think Androids are way better, and easy to use. That's all I've had sense the iPhone 4! Wouldn't go back to an iPhone but would take it over a Pixel any day!!😝 Christopher Hopkins First off who ever made this post is just a glorified iPhone fan and downing the Google pixel I've had mine since launch and so have the 3 others on my account and all of us can say nothing has gone wrong with my pixel not once so get off your high horse and the back glass part of my phone is not scratched still and this is the same phone since launch same with my GF her brother and my best friend on my account Stanced Imports What a joke review I've had a Google pixel since January this phone is the best phone I've ever had, and I've had a iPhone 7😂 if you can't afford it that's not a reason to not buy it, that's a choice the consumer should make not a reflection on the phones performance 😁 I live in Canada so my Google pixel is about 1000$ and it's worth every penny Stanced Imports Also I find it's nice that the phones availability is scarce so I don't look at everyone and they all have the same phone. vitriolix "unsupported by October 2018" That's wrong, they will still get security patches until Oct 2019. Still too short, but let's not warp the facts MikeOxlong Nobody cares what Ruddock thinks. Sorry. Makikiguy Nexus 5 is my first smart phone and I ain't changing.

Google Phone v10 enables post-call messages for failed calls, prepares for enhanced incoming calls on RCS and voicemail backup [APK Teardown + Download] Cody Toombs Follow View All Posts 2017/05/23 1:19pm PDTMay 23, 2017 59 Plus 1 on G+ 111 Share on Facebook 54 Share on Twitter Total Shares224 APK Teardown Applications Downloads News Article Contents 1 What's New 1.1 Post-call messages 2 Teardown 2.1 RCS Calling 2.2 Voicemail Backup 3 Download With the dust settling after the deluge caused by I/O 2017, it's time to take a closer look at some of the many other things that came with out last week. Some interesting changes came with a brand new version of the Google Phone app included with Android O Developer Preview 2. There's a new prompt suggesting users send a message after a call fails to connect. A deep dive into the apk also turned up signs that Google is working on new RCS calling features and preparing some kind of backup option for voicemail. What's New Unofficial Changelog: (the stuff we found) Post-call messaging Post-call messages Earlier this month, a teardown of of v9 provided a good hint that the Phone app would begin showing suggestions for messages to send after completing a call. With v10, that feature is now live, but not quite as functional as previously expected. Left: snackbar prompt. Right: new message screen. The post-call messaging feature appears as a snackbar prompt asking why you called, to which you can send a message. The prompt only appears after attempting a call that fails without making a connection. To be specific, the prompt won't show up if you hang up, a voicemail service answers, or anything else occurs that would be considered a connection. Basically, if you hear a sound indicating the other end is ringing, any outcome from that point on is probably not going to trigger the prompt. You're most likely to see this prompt in an area where cellular reception isn't good enough to establish a voice call, but you can also force it to show up by trying to make a call while airplane mode is active. Otherwise, it's probably not going to turn up anywhere else. If you opt to send a message, you'll be taken to a screen with a message box and three pre-written messages with different levels of urgency. Tapping a message will put it into the textbox below, but you can continue to make edits before sending. The exact text of the prompt seems to be a mismatch for the current functionality, which left us wondering if this feature is also intended to work in other scenarios like when the call is redirected to voicemail or disconnects within a second of being picked up. Perhaps this is just the first step and other use cases will be handled in the future. In the meantime, this actually might be handy if you're in the middle of nowhere and staring at a single signal bar with no hope of making a call. Teardown Disclaimer: Teardowns are based on evidence found inside of apks (Android's application package) and are necessarily speculative and usually based on incomplete information. It's possible that the guesses made here are totally and completely wrong. Even when predictions are correct, there is always a chance that plans could change or may be canceled entirely. Much like rumors, nothing is certain until it's officially announced and released. The features discussed below are probably not live yet, or may only be live for a small percentage of users. Unless stated otherwise, don't expect to see these features if you install the apk. RCS Calling It's no secret that Google is working to add fairly extensive RCS support to both its Phone app and Android Messages. Now it's just a matter of which features are going to be added and when we'll get to use some them. This update to the Phone app gives us a bit more insight into some new rich calling features that we'll soon have at our disposal. A stack of new notification strings reveal that Google's developers are currently working on supporting incoming calls with additional data. At this time, it's clear calls can include a location, photo, message, or any combination of those. One line also mentions "attachments," which may suggest other types of data are supported, but not necessarily known in advance. This would make sense for things like URLs or specially crafted data packets can be handed off between other apps. It's also worth noting that these strings are split up for regular and "important" calls, which lines up with the commonly known feature allowing callers to indicate a degree of urgency. code <string name="important_notification_incoming_call_attachments">Important incoming call with attachments</string> <string name="important_notification_incoming_call_with_location">Important incoming call with location</string> <string name="important_notification_incoming_call_with_message">Important incoming call with message</string> <string name="important_notification_incoming_call_with_message_location">Important incoming call with message and location</string> <string name="important_notification_incoming_call_with_photo">Important incoming call with photo</string> <string name="important_notification_incoming_call_with_photo_location">Important incoming call with photo and location</string> <string name="important_notification_incoming_call_with_photo_message">Important incoming call with photo and message</string> <string name="important_notification_incoming_call_with_photo_message_location">Important incoming call with photo, message and location</string> <string name="notification_incoming_call_attachments">Incoming call with attachments</string> <string name="notification_incoming_call_with_location">Incoming call with location</string> <string name="notification_incoming_call_with_message">Incoming call with message</string> <string name="notification_incoming_call_with_message_location">Incoming call with message and location</string> <string name="notification_incoming_call_with_photo">Incoming call with photo</string> <string name="notification_incoming_call_with_photo_location">Incoming call with photo and location</string> <string name="notification_incoming_call_with_photo_message">Incoming call with photo and message</string> <string name="notification_incoming_call_with_photo_message_location">Incoming call with photo, message and location</string> It's not yet clear if attachments will be shown on the screen with incoming calls, but I think it's a pretty safe bet that they will be. After all, knowing there's a photo with the call isn't nearly as compelling as actually seeing it. This was part of the pitch for the Knock Knock feature when Google introduced the Duo app at last year's I/O keynote. The same certainly can be said about locations and messages, as well. So far, there doesn't appear to be an interface for callers to actually attach this type of data, so it's safe to say development is still ongoing. Seeing as most carriers are still stuck on very rudimentary implementations of RCS and intra-network compatibility is moving at a sloth-like pace, I'm sure Google will have this done long before any of us would get to use it. Voicemail Backup Are you the type of person that never deletes voicemails? This one might be for you. It seems that Google will begin asking users if they want to turn on "extra storage" when their voicemail inbox fills its capacity. This allows Google to "manage and backup your voicemail messages" to free up some space. code <string name="voicemail_error_inbox_almost_full_turn_archive_on_title">Turn on extra storage and backup</string> <string name="voicemail_error_inbox_almost_full_turn_archive_on_message">Your mailbox is almost full. To free up space, turn on extra storage so Google can manage and backup your voicemail messages.</string> <string name="voicemail_error_inbox_full_turn_archive_on_title">Turn on extra storage and backup</string> <string name="voicemail_error_inbox_full_turn_archive_on_message">Your mailbox is full. To free up space, turn on extra storage so Google can manage and backup your voicemail messages.</string> <string name="voicemail_action_turn_archive_on">Turn on</string> <string name="voicemail_action_dimiss">No Thanks</string> At this point, I should say that there are a few different things this could be, and I'm at a loss for which one it is. For starters, this could be a new aspect for Project Fi subscribers and the included voicemail service. If so, it might mean Google intends to prompt people with a lot of saved voicemails to push the older ones into their Drive storage. It's a simple explanation, and might be an attempt to squeeze a few bucks out of people that never delete anything, but hardly seems necessary. Another possibility is that this only relates to the voicemails downloaded and stored on your phone, which means it's just a basic housekeeping feature to keep unnecessary audio files out of your local storage or expand the quota to allow for more. I tend to doubt this is the explanation because the text doesn't really line up with that purpose and it seems like the type of thing that should happen automatically, users shouldn't even need to be prompted. Finally, I'm going to take the opportunity to speculate about something a little crazy. Perhaps this is intended for the voicemail service provided by other carriers. If this is the case, I imagine the phone app might detect your voicemail is nearing capacity and offers to manage backups of it. If the user agrees, Google will connect to that provider's voicemail and proceed to back up all of the messages to Drive for the user, then delete them to free up space. Again, this is massively speculative and feels like a long shot... But it's also the type of weirdly cool feature Google occasionally comes up with. There's not much else to go on with this, but it's entirely possible this feature / warning / error message is already live. It may only show up for users connecting to a specific carrier or with special circumstances that aren't very predictable. I'm not really the right person to test it since I only have three voicemails saved, but perhaps readers with a larger backlog will have something to add to this. Download The APK is signed by Google and upgrades your existing app. The cryptographic signature guarantees that the file is safe to install and was not tampered with in any way. Rather than wait for Google to push this download to your devices, which can take days, download and install it just like any other APK.

Carson Saldanha They were mistaken. Artem Russakovskii Which feature specifically? Pedram Haghzaban This post-call messages for failed calls Duder12 Voicemail features will never matter since carriers don't allow them in the US. Prop Dad I use this app for VM. What features don't matter? Richard Riker strange. minsdk is 23, target is 25. Won't install on N (app is not compatible) even when i'm running v9 already. Any dependancy update needed? because no problem with clock from the preview Carson Saldanha Just to confirm, you're trying to sideload it on a Nexus/Pixel device, right? Artem Russakovskii Are you on arm64? Richard Riker uh...totally overseen that. Corey Kinard Is there any way auto post-call spam messages, sent from (detected) spam callers, could be auto blocked and deleted the same way they plan on doing with the verification codes?

John Unfortunately, many features don't work on the patched version. There are older official versions available for non-Nexus devices at apkmirror. Version 9.something is the latest. We will likely never see an official version. Previous official versions that work on non-Nexus phones were mistakes that were pulled. Samsung and others modify their dialers so that Google Phone doesn't work well unless the stock apps are disabled which may require root. Carlos Rodríguez Midly related, but SMS backups are coming to Nexus devices on O. If you toggle the switch of and on in Settings > System > Backup, a new option for SMS backup appears, just like on the Pixel. Cheers! Lynxy Dear lord, you're right! I'll try to test that the next time I reset the phone while on O. Alex I don't see that option. Nexus 6P in the UK. Latest O version. Carlos Rodríguez In phone settings > system > backup, turn off the switch for backup in Google Drive, then turn it back on. You'll see the SMS backup like on the Pixel. Alex Hmm, that requires deleting what's already backed up. I think I'll skip this until it is rolled out properly. Thanks for the help though. Carlos Rodríguez Yes, deletes the backup, but makes a new one as soon you turn it on. No loss of data actually. Fayas Android O on Nexus 5X. can't see that option to backup SMS. Carlos Rodríguez It only appeared for me when I turned backup off and on. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/6e53aa283e8271597b15df245154ecc06126d368853b89fa516c6076dbf49ac2.jpg Fayas Thanks, I got it after turning off and on back. But it shows me as waiting to back up for SMS and Call Log. Don't know why. Carlos Rodríguez It will eventually back up the SMS. The call log is stil waiting. James Well according to Google's implementation of the omtp visual voicemail standard (https://source.android.com/devices/tech/config/voicemail) it's vvm client "Fetches details of voicemail quota (total mailbox size and occupied size)" from the carrier so it's probably for carriers that have implemented the stock omtp vvm standard like t-mobile. James Briano Tangentially related: Anyone else getting errors with the phone app on Dev Preview 2? App keeps crashing when I have an incoming call. Nexus 6P. Cody Toombs I haven't put the SIM card into my 6P for more than a couple of minutes since the developer previews started going on there, so I can't comment to that exact scenario, but it has been working perfectly on my Pixel running 7.1.2. I've had pretty regular issues with Google apps crashing on DP1 and DP2. It may be a coincidence, but it seems especially bad for any app that uses hardware components like GPS and cellular radio. I'm not complaining since we all should know the deal with bleeding edge releases, but I think the O developer previews have been the buggiest I've used since Google started with KitKat. Andy J "It's not yet clear if attachments will be shown on the screen with incoming calls, but I think it's a pretty safe bet that they will be." Yes - yes it is. All the stuff people are left wondering about is covered in a LOT of depth in the Universal Profile spec - in this particular case, selecting a photo to be shown on the receivers screen when the phone call comes in - is specifically detailed in the spec. It's worth also being aware that as it's also specifically in the spec that the phone book must expose which contacts support Universal Profile - that I'd expect both the contacts app and the dialer app to be opened up to all devices on the Play Store before too much longer - otherwise only Messages supports RCS and people will have phones where they can't actually tell if they can make a video call or send someone a file (or their location) - all they can do is send them a message. mike shwilly Can i just have Swipe to Delete sms feature? Manikandan Guru Working fine on my OP3T. aRvInD Instead of this pretty useless idea, I wish Google places Redial button in same place. Which more people will find relevant and useful... hp-fourtwenty double tap the dial button to redial. tap it once to see the last number dialed. aRvInD No you misunderstood context. I wrote about redial only with call doesn't connect or failed without connecting.. After call disconnects then open dialer - double tap dialer, Simple button there to redial wouldve been great.. F4LL0U7 It's really frustrating that with all of these enhancements, there STILL isn't a way to use your Google Voice number by default instead of your carrier number. You can set the option to place all calls through GV, but if I try to send an SMS follow-up to a rejected call, or send an SMS through Assistant, it still uses the carrier number.

It basically allows users to browse their photo collections and select images to be added to a physical picture album that will be printed and mailed to their door. Now Google has updated their mobile Photos apps, so you can create your photo albums right from an iOS or Android device. The new Photo Books feature went live last week shortly after it was announced, but unfortunately it required users to log into Google Photos on a desktop browser. The update to the Photos app on iOS and Android means that’s no longer a requirement, and it still includes the option to have Google’s AI automatically select and format the best pictures. There’s only two types of book to choose from at this point, unfortunately, but the prices are more than reasonable. A 7-inch by 7-inch softcover album with 20 pages will cost you $10, while 20-page hardcover version measures 9 inches by 9 inches and is priced at $20. The other major downside is that Google is only making these Photo Books available to users in the US. There’s no word yet on when or if Google will open this feature up to other parts of the world, but they hopefully will soon.

Menu About Information Operations Holistic Organizers IO, Cyber, SC, PD Community Calendar Name and Shame, Educating the Media Information operations · Information Warfare · Russia Russian Hackers Are Using Google’s Own Infrastructure to Hack Gmail Users May 27, 2017 Joel Harding LORENZO FRANCESCHI-BICCHIERAI May 26 2017, 10:42am Security researchers have exposed a sophisticated hacking and disinformation campaign that targeted more than 200 Gmail users. Russian government hackers seem to have figured out that sometimes the best way to hack into people’s Gmail accounts is be to abuse Google’s own services. On Thursday, researchers exposed a massive Russian espionage and disinformation campaign using emails designed to trick users into giving up their passwords, a technique that’s known as phishing. The hackers targeted more than 200 victims, including, among others, journalists and activists critical of the Russian government, as well as people affiliated with the Ukrainian military, and high-ranking officials in energy companies around the world, according to a new report. Researchers at the Citizen Lab, a digital rights research group at the University of Toronto’s Munk School of Global Affairs, were able to identify all these victims following clues left in two phishing emails sent to David Satter, an American journalist and academic who’s written Soviet and modern Russia, and who has been banned from the country in 2014. On October 7, Satter received a phishing email designed to look like it was coming from Google, claiming someone had stolen his password and that he should change it right away. As with seen with other phishing attacks targeting people affiliated with the Hillary Clinton campaign that led to the DNC leaks of last year, the email, however, didn’t come from Google. It was actually from a group of hackers known as Fancy Bear, or APT28, whom many believe work for Russia’s military intelligence, the GRU. A screenshot of the phishing email received by David Satter (Image: Citizen Lab) The “Change Password” button linked to a short URL from the Tiny.cc link shortener service, a Bitly competitor. But the hackers cleverly disguised it as a legitimate link by using Google’s Accelerated Mobile Pages, or AMP. This is a service hosted by the internet giant that was originally designed to speed up web pages on mobile, especially for publishers. In practice, it works by creating a copy of a website’s page on Google’s servers, but it also acts as an open redirect. According to Citizen Lab researchers, the hackers used Google AMP to trick the targets into thinking the email really came from Google. “It’s a percentage game, you may not get every person you phish but you’ll get a percentage,” John Scott-Railton, a senior researcher at Citizen Lab, told Motherboard. So if the victim had quickly hovered over the button to inspect the link, they would have seen a URL that starts with google.com/amp, which seems safe, and it’s followed by a Tiny.cc URL, which the user might not have noticed. (For example: https://www.google[.]com/amp/tiny.cc/63q6iy) Using Google’s own redirect service was also perhaps also a way to get the phishing email past Gmail’s automated filters against spam and malicious messages. “It’s a percentage game, you may not get every person you phish but you’ll get a percentage.” According to Citizen Lab, who doesn’t directly point the finger at Fancy Bear, the email was actually sent by annaablony[@]mail.com. That address was used in 2015 by Fancy Bear to register a domain, according to security firm ThreatConnect. And another domain used in the October attacks exposed by Citizen Lab was also previously linked to Fancy Bear, according to SecureWorks, which tracked the phishing campaign against the DNC and the Clinton campaign. Curiously, the email targeting Satter came just a few days before Google warned some Russian journalists and activists that “government-backed attackers” were trying to hack them using malicious Tiny.cc links. A screenshot of a phishing email received by a Bellingcat journalist in October Now we know that in October of 2016, when the hackers targeted Satter and at least 200 other people, the trick of using Google AMP was working, and Google hadn’t blocked it. Google has previously dismissed concerns about open redirectors, arguing that “a small number of properly monitored redirectors offers fairly clear benefits and poses very little practical risk.” On Thursday, a company spokesperson said that this is a known issue and last year some Google AMP URLs started showing a warning if the company’s systems are uncertain whether the link is safe to visit, such as this. But for some security researchers, they are dangerous. “The AMP service’s behavior as an open redirect for desktop browsers was clearly abused in this situation and is also just trivial to abuse in general,” Nicholas Weaver, a senior researcher at the International Computer Science Institute at UC Berkeley, told Motherboard in an email. “There is undoubtedly some engineering tradeoff I’m not seeing that causes them to maintain it.” Google’s redirectors might not be the only part of Google’s infrastructure that Fancy Bear hackers have been taking advantage of. Citizen Lab researchers found a Tiny.cc URL that targeted an email address—myprimaryreger[@]gmail.com—that other security researchers suspect was used by Fancy Bear to test their own attacks. A screenshot of the Google Plus page of “myprimaryreger[@]gmail.com,” an account researchers believe was controlled by Fancy Bear (Image: Citizen Lab). That address had a Google Plus page filled with images that appear in real, legitimate Gmail security alerts. It’s unclear what the hackers used these for, or if they used them at all. But the researchers said that perhaps the hackers were embedding them in phishing emails, and the fact that they were hosted on Google Plus perhaps helped thwart Gmail’s security controls. The Fancy Bear hackers are known to use popular services like URL shorteners in their high-profile hacking operations. And, sometimes, those URL shorteners betray them and end up revealing who they targeted. Between March 2015 and May 2016, as part of their operation to hack Clinton’s campaign chairman John Podesta, and former National Security Advisor Colin Powell, the hackers targeted more than 6,000 people with more than 19,000 phishing links. Some of those used Bitly URLs that, as it turned out, could be decoded to figure out who they were intended to. An analysis of the Bitly link used to phish John Podesta (Image: Thomas Rid/Twitter) Similarly, in this case Citizen Lab researchers were able to identify the victims by figuring out that there was a pattern behind how Tiny.cc creates short URLs. That pattern, as research fellow Adam Hulcoop explained to me, “was chronological.” So, starting from the links sent to Satter, the researchers were able to guess other links created around the same time. It’s impossible to know why the hackers keep relying on services like Bitly or Tiny.cc, which end up exposing some of their operations—although months later. One explanation could be that their phishing campaigns are highly automated, given that they target thousands of people. So, as Hulcoop put it, they need a modular phishing infrastructure where every element can be modified if needed, as “an insurance policy of sorts” and they use third party services “to try and balance the need for OpSec [operational security, or the practice of keeping operations secret] with the ability to operate at scale.” “The construction of the Tiny.cc shortcodes pointing to TinyURL shortcodes, which ultimately point to phishing sites on different servers. This modularity is likely by design so that the operator can change up the individual components, servers, redirectors, etc., and only abandon the pieces that are burned,” he said in an online chat. “The more layers you have, the more flexible you can be.” Source: https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/russian-hackers-are-using-googles-own-infrastructure-to-hack-gmail-users Advertisements Share this: Pinterest Tumblr LinkedIn Google Twitter Facebook Email Reddit Print Like this: Like Loading...

McMaster ‘Not Concerned’ Over Jared Kushner Back-Channel Reports BlockchainBlockchain Offers Hope for the Broken Internet Google Google Claims Reporting Wage Data in Gender Suit Is Just Too Hard David Z. Morris May 27, 2017 Apparently Google’s mastery of data doesn’t extend to its own wage information – at least, not when it’s under investigation. During Friday testimony in a Department of Labor suit accusing Google of widespread and systematic wage discrimination against women, the tech giant’s lawyers argued that continued compliance with government demands for salary records would be too expensive and complicated. Google representatives testified that further reporting would take as much as 500 labor-hours and cost $100,000. Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter. As reported by The Guardian, Department of Labor lawyers pushed back against Google's objections, with DoL attorney Ian Eliasoph saying “Google would be able to absorb the cost as easily as a dry kitchen sponge could absorb a single drop of water.” A Google lawyer claimed that the company had already devoted 2,300 labor hours and $500,000 to complying with parts of the government’s requests for records. A Google manager describing the process said that it had required building new systems while reviewing and revising large amounts of data. Over time, those efforts have become “too burdensome.” But DoL lawyers pointed out that Google earns millions of dollars annually from government contracts, which require stringent compliance with equal opportunity laws. The Labor Department also attempted to rebuff Google’s claims that these tasks were too complex because of the size of its workforce. Eliasoph said “Google takes routine requests and makes them sound onerous by emphasizing the number of people involved.” Google's claims of burden are also odd because the company has previously conducted its own in-depth internal analysis of pay practices, which it says found no gender discrimination. In fact, Google says it has closed both gender and race-based pay gaps in its U.S. workforce. On its page devoted to fair pay best practices, Google describes the analysis behind that conclusion as “a complicated process [that] requires advanced statistics skills and could have serious legal implications for your organization.” Customer ServiceSite MapPrivacy PolicyAdvertisingAd ChoicesTerms of UseYour California Privacy RightsCareers © 2017 Time Inc.

自由電子報 | 影音娛樂 | 好康報報 | 自由部落 ‧Business Home Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorials Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Home / Business Sun, May 28, 2017 - Page 16　 Print Mail Facebook Twitter plurk funp Apple said to plan dedicated AI chip FUTURE BUSINESS:The company has not been implementing AI aggressively despite its importance in self-driving cars and augmented reality, on which Apple is focusing Bloomberg Apple Inc got an early start in artificial intelligence (AI) software with the 2011 introduction of Siri, a tool that lets users operate their smartphones with voice commands. Now the electronics giant is bringing AI to chips. Apple is working on a processor devoted specifically to AI-related tasks, a person familiar with the matter said. The chip, known internally as the Apple Neural Engine, would improve the way Apple devices handle tasks that would otherwise require human intelligence, such as facial and speech recognition, said the person, who requested anonymity discussing a product that has not been made public. Apple declined to comment. Engineers at Apple are racing to catch their peers at Amazon.com Inc and Alphabet Inc in the booming field of AI. While Siri gave Apple an early advantage in voice-recognition, competitors have been more aggressive in deploying AI across their product lines, including Amazon’s Echo and Google’s Home digital assistants. “Two of the areas that Apple is betting its future on require AI,” said Gene Munster, former Apple analyst and cofounder of venture capital firm Loup Ventures. “At the core of augmented reality and self-driving cars is artificial intelligence.” Apple devices handle complex AI processes with two different chips: the main processor and the graphics chip. The new chip would let Apple offload those tasks onto a dedicated module designed specifically for demanding AI processing, allowing Apple to improve battery performance. Should Apple bring the chip out of testing and development, it would follow other semiconductor makers that have already introduced dedicated AI chips. Qualcomm Inc’s Snapdragon chip for smartphones has a module for handling AI tasks, while Google announced its first chip, called the Tensor Processing Unit, last year. That chip worked in Google’s data centers to power search results and image recognition. At its I/O conference this year, Google announced a new version that is to be available to clients of its cloud business. Nvidia Corp also sells a similar chip to cloud customers. Apple has tested prototypes of new iPhones with the chip, the person with knowledge of the matter said, adding that it is unclear if the component will be ready this year. The company’s operating systems and software features would integrate with devices that include the chip. For example, Apple has considered offloading facial recognition in the photographs application, some parts of speech recognition, and the iPhone’s predictive keyboard to the chip, the person said. Apple also plans to offer developer access to the chip so third-party apps can also offload AI-related tasks, the person said. An AI chip would join a growing list of processors that Apple has created in-house. The company began designing its own main processors for the iPhone and iPad in 2010 with the A4 chip. It has since released dedicated processors to power the Apple Watch, the motion sensors across its products, the wireless components inside of its AirPods and the fingerprint scanner in the MacBook Pro. The company has also tested a chip to run the low-power mode on Mac laptops. This story has been viewed 1174 times. Comments will be moderated.

Data editor at Google News, Simon Rogers, said the new tool will let you turn difficult number charts into more entertaining GIF illustrations. Data GIF Maker as Google calls its new tool, will allow you to set your desired parameters and transform them into data visuals. Journalists, according to Rogers, will find Data GIF Maker highly reliable when telling their stories. As a matter of fact, it is a tool that will benefit virtually every use—and not just journalists. What use can the animations made from the new tool be to you? You can use them for a lot of things, including storytelling approaches as a journalist. Here is more information on what you can do with Data GIF Maker as described in a blog post by Rogers: “We typically use the tool to represent competing search interest, but it can show whatever you want it to—polling numbers, sales figures, movie ratings, etc. If you want to show search interest, you can compare two terms in the Google Trends explore tool, which will give you an average number (of search interest over time) for each term. Then input those two numbers in Data Gif Maker.” As expected, it’s an online tool that works on your browser, and takes only a few minutes to make your GIF. You can download your GIF as soon as you have finished making it, and of course, use or share it as you wish. Here is a summary of how to use the new online tool: The first step is to start by entering your data points. Next is to choose names for the points of comparison in question. Then, select colors for each of your data entry. And of course, you also need to add explanatory text. Finally, you will have to click ‘Download as GIF’ to generate the images. The steps are obviously very easy to follow, and making your first set of GIFs using the new tool from Google shouldn’t be a difficult task for anyone. You can head up to this Google blog to make your first GIF. Is this Google’s way of competing with Giphy? I don’t really think so, but it presents us with another alternative when it comes to making animated GIFs. In other Google news, an Archive feature has now been added to Google Photos to enable you hide your private photos. Archive will let you remove those private images from the main Photo tab without getting rid of them from your library. Not everyone has seen the new Archive feature yet—and the last time I checked, it wasn’t there. However, the report went on to say that the Archive option is placed in the drawer above Trash. You can access Archive from the overflow menu of any picture—and of course, it comes with a tutorial popping up the first time you open it.

The company is currently being investigated by the Department of Labor for “systemic compensation disparities” between men and women. And according to a report in The Guardian, its lawyers argued that it should not have to provide wage data as part of the lawsuit, because the effort of pulling the data together would be too expensive, costing $100,000 and requiring 500 hours of labor. The money element is genuinely laughable. Ian Eliasoph, a lawyer for the Department of Labor, openly mocked the claim in court. “Google would be able to absorb the cost as easy as a dry kitchen sponge could absorb a single drop of water,” he said. Plus, based on the latest data from Pew Research Center, Google has likely already robbed women of far more than 500 hours worth of labor. Pew’s 2015 numbers showed that, on average, “it would take an extra 44 days of work for women to earn what men did in 2015.” Assuming a (charitable) 7.5-hour work day, that’s 330 hours per employee per year. Google would only have to wage-discriminate against two women employees per year at the national average in order to ride their way to 500 free hours of labor. Honestly, though, the math isn’t even the most absurd part of this claim. It’s the reversal of the victim dynamic. What Alphabet’s lawyers are arguing is that the real victim here would be Google. Women should expect to be robbed in the name of sexism, but a company can’t be expected to check up on its labor practices to ensure equality. Wage discrimination is a burden women can bear; the cost of fair labor practices, though, is a burden the company cannot. The Department of Labor initially sued Google in January 2017 for failing to comply with its obligations as a federal contractor. Back in September of 2015, Google was asked to submit its compensation data as part of a routine compliance evaluation. However, they repeatedly failed to do so over the next year and a half, and so the Department of Labor filed a suit. In an official statement, the Acting Director of the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, Thomas M. Dowd, said, “Like other federal contractors, Google has a legal obligation to provide relevant information requested in the course of a routine compliance evaluation. Despite many opportunities to produce this information voluntarily, Google has refused to do so. We filed this lawsuit so we can obtain the information we need to complete our evaluation.” It’s worth noting the racial dynamics of this as well. Google’s workforce is overwhelmingly white and Asian, which would usually mean that the wage gap should be smaller and less noticeable. Nationally, black women and Latinx women suffer the most from the wage gap, while white women’s earnings now outpace those of black and Hispanic workers of all genders. Meanwhile, Asian women overall face the smallest wage gap among women as compared to white, non-Hispanic men – but these overall numbers definitely mask the very high wage gaps for groups like Burmese, Indonesian, Pakistani, Fijian, and Vietnamese women. (However, given their other labor practices, I’m willing to guess that Google mostly hires its Asian worker population from those groups that are already more advantaged.) Now, in fairness to Google, lawyers are paid to make ridiculous “undue burden” arguments like this one. It’s part of their job to defend their client, and Google isn’t unique in this. However, the company’s resistance to turning over their salary information tells me all I need to know: they know it won’t look good. Looks like it’s time to update that retired company motto. “Don’t be evil – to white men.” (Via The Guardian and Business Insider; image via Shutterstock) Want more stories like this?

Google is now offering four free months of Google Play Music for new subscribers Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/26 2:17pm PDTMay 26, 2017 70 Plus 1 on G+ 511 Share on Facebook 83 Share on Twitter Total Shares664 Google News Right now it looks like Google is running a special offer for Google Play Music. New subscribers that sign up here can get four free months of service instead of the usual three. No telling how long this offer might last, so if you have been considering subscribing, now might be the time to do it. It could save you an extra $10. Again, this particular offer is only for new subscribers. I've been a fan of Play Music for a long time, though the device removal limit does get in the way when you switch between devices and ROMs as often as I do. Being able to mix your own library with those of a service also comes in handy. That way I can continue to support artists I am passionate about, without eschewing the larger selection of a subscription offering for the purposes of content discovery, all while being able to fill the gaps in that library. There are a lot of different music services out there, but if you're interested combining your curated library with music available via a subscription, then your options are limited. Spotify does allow you to play back locally stored files, which is convenient, but it isn't quite the same. Amazon also allows you to upload your music for playback via Amazon Music, and with Amazon Prime membership, you get a small library of streaming music to go along with that. For $10 a month ($8 for Prime members) you can access their full library as well. But, Google Play Music has a great interface and plugs nicely into all the other Google services we love. Maybe with this new offer, it's time you gave Google Play Music a chance? After all, even if it doesn't end up working out, you still got four free months of music out of the deal.

Carson Saldanha Wait, wdym 3 different countries? Did you share it with others or something? Ailín Ó’S I live in Ireland, so that's my main account. I have a secondary account based in England as part of a mail forwarder service I use, and my bf is Greek so I had him check the code on his account :) Carson Saldanha Oh wow! Carson Saldanha Hey, since I know it worked for you, are you able to use YouTube Red along with this Play Music free trial? Because my YT Red doesn't seem to be enabled for me. Ailín Ó’S No, unfortunately not as I live in the EU and YouTube Red is only available in USA. Carson Saldanha Weird, I'm in the US though. Ailín Ó’S Ooh that is odd. Sign out of the app then sign back in maybe? Carson Saldanha No luck :( I'm in contact with Google support atm Hopefully they can sort this out Mike Worth it alone for Youtube Red MisterAlex Sweet, I wasn't sure if that was included. Thanks. Should mention that in the main blog post. Ben Still no student membership >:( Ailín Ó’S Spotify is a great alternative @€$£5/month. Ben I know that's what I use just because it's half the price. Ailín Ó’S In Ireland Vodafone have a partnership with Spotify whereby it costs €5 standard instead of €10 regardless of if you're a student or not, they even bundle it with some of their plans. Vodafone do the same in some other countries they operate in (not all). Maybe see if any network in your country has a partnership like that? Worth a shot! Ben Oh yeah I'm on EE in the UK and I've got Apple Music for free for 6 months but like iTunes is a massive stinking turd. Ailín Ó’S I'd rather go back to the days of getting music via Bluetooth from friends than use crApple Music 😂😂 Rahul Krishna In india, we have play music for 1.4 usd/month Umang Ladia I'm only seeing 2 months offer in India.?? Rahul Krishna Well I subscribed to it when it launched here (about 2 months ago), so I can't confirm that. But at this price, there is nothing to be disappointed about. aRvInD I wish Spotify launches soon here. I can't keep using that patched version here...!! Rahul Krishna Me too xyz As it should be, you can't charge European or American prices in India. Rahul Krishna Yes true. There are lots​ of people here with a very cheap Android phone. They cannot pay much money. Julian Coronado That's actually what's keeping me away from Play Music. I've used my free months and I loved the Youtube Red too. But as a student, Spotify for $5 / month is too great to pass up on. Emiliejmosley Google is paying 97$ per hour! Work for few hours & have longer with friends and family! !sm141c: On tuesday I got a great new Land Rover Range Rover from having earned $8752 this last four weeks..

Cakefish Spotify ftw ToniCipriani ✓pǝᴉɟᴉɹǝʌ I don't think this is a new offer, got this a while back. In fact my 4 months is expiring next week. Prefer Spotify over it. Song selection a tad bit weaker, and for foreign songs it tries to translate the song names to English and makes it hard to look up. folkrav I like it, it's way cheaper than Spotify for me - my mother, my sister, my wife and myself each pay 30$ a year and we're set - but Jesus do I hate the clients. I don't like the website's interface, I hate the Android app. But yeah, I'll deal with it cause it's cheap, I guess. Carson Saldanha Got it! Yay! Jim I wish I could somehow get it on my Amazon Echo hahaha. I guess if I had paid for a Google Home it would be worth trying out. Forget vega #getEVGA Why google play music isn't available in my country ? Ailín Ó’S Try Apple Music? They seem to be just about everywhere. Iamsecond And this is why Apple continue to dominate, because Apple are truly interested in being an international company whereas Google is just playing at it. Such a shame xyz Because Google sucks. Bartek Juszczak My GPM radio's are so good these days I love that Google is so into AI. Whether It's just "I'm being lucky" or radio from a specific song, band or album they very rarely disappoint me these days. I just make sure to thumbs up if it plays a song I particularly love. I am a student and could go cheaper with spotify but the AI generated playlists have me locked in. If it's £5 cheaper but I'm not gonna enjoy it nearly as much then it's not really a good deal. AndTheWorldMayNeverKnow I used the 3 or 4 months free trial during the holidays then bought the family plan for $14.99 a month. 4 people in my family us it and it works great, the app could use some tweaks but it's really good overall. paev If you listen to main stream music it doesn't really matter what service to use. However, if you like something unusual, weird or other languages then Google is a way to go. I found bands on Google music that Spotify displayed as not found. Google also have new synth bands that Spotify doesn't. I'm for Google too. Daniel I discovered that GPM is kinda like a music label. I once went to a section of Google play explaining how indie artists can use GPM like a music label as long as they own all their rights. Ryne Hager Ultraista (among others) keeps me using Google Play Music as well as Spotify. Carson Saldanha Does anyone else who activated the Play Music trial have YouTube Red working as well? My YT Red doesn't seem to be enabled while my Play Music is. Michael Carr I spotted a similar offer a couple of months ago, and I took it after a day or two's thought. Just last week, I moved directly into a family plan. PewPewYoureDead It's hard to recommend Google Play Music until they revamp the UI. Margaritas Ante Porcos Google Music is the only choice in some markets, like Russia, where no Spotify or Pandora are available. There are too many shortcomings in Google Music and Google never shows interest in making services better than below average. I really wonder why Google refuses to become the best at anything. Real magic here. Pixel syndrome all the way. Yet Google Music is on my phone and I use it because there's no choice whatsoever. Rob You answered your own question. If there's no alternative, then they don't have any incentive to improve the service. SupahNin10doh Stupid Dorito logo... Raymond Berger Huh, I just subscribed to the trial but you youtube red hasn't kicked in yet. Any idea how long it takes? Iamsecond If you live in the UK, about 2 years so far h20ray Google Play Music is currently available in select territories and for select account types. Umang Ladia I'm only seeing 2 months offer in India, anybody can confirm? Mohammad Ovais Yeah, same for me. Maybe it's region limited. Isolde I think you need to open the link in a browser, if you open it in the app it's just the normal 2 months. Manoj | Blogging Triggers Is Google Music really worth to it? We have better alternatives Sathiya Moorthy Karan I came across a great post, it seems to be so cool http://developeit.net/android-news-image-scanner-finder/ Zachariah Mann It only shows up as 2 free months for me. I live in Michigan. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/a19b7e9dddb67bf897c751aedf63c01917048214140db901fd783b2182d8d5c0.png Mikael Jakobsson Should mabye joine premium at Google Music if that coste like $2 max a month dont understand why they should take as mutch as someone some has app or Win32 software to PC so music controllers one they keyboards works. Tab out frome a game for pause music when the round is over is just bad. Arif Gürü And stil isnt available on Turkey xyz "No telling how long this offer might last, so if you have been considering subscribing, now might be the time to do it." No thanks, I'll just use YouTube. Only thing YT needs is an option to play audio only so I can save a wee bit more data when I don't need video.

However the good news is that Google is now offering new subscribers a 4 month free trial which means that if you’re curious as to whether or not Google Play Music is a good fit for you, you’ve got 4 months to try it out. Note that the 4 month trial is longer than some of the competition, namely Apple Music which is only offering users a 3 month free trial. In fact in some countries Apple has actually started to charge their users a $0.99 fee to take part in the trial, so for some users this trial isn’t even free at all. However we should point out that Google’s offer is only for new subscribers, meaning that if you’ve never signed up for a Google Play Music account/trial before, then only can you participate. If you’ve taken part in the previous trial then we guess you’d be out of luck. Then again the previous trial was for 3 months and we’re not sure if the extra month really makes a difference in coming to a decision. There’s no word on how long this offer will last or if it is permanent, however Google’s website states that it is a special offer so perhaps it might not be permanent. More details can be found on the Play Store. Filed in Audio. Read more about Google and Music.

Tech giants seeking to reinforce their leads in artificial intelligence or make up for lost ground have been the most aggressive buyers. Alphabet Inc.’s Google has acquired 11 AI start-ups since 2012, the most of any firm, followed by Apple Inc., Facebook Inc., and Intel Corp., respectively. The companies declined to comment on their acquisition strategies. A spokesman for Apple did confirm the company’s recent purchase of Lattice Data, a start-up that specializes in working with unstructured data. Ford Motor The first quarter also saw one of the largest deals to date as Ford Motor Co. invested $1 billion in Argo AI, founded by former executives on self-driving teams at Google and Uber Technologies Inc. Start-ups are looking to go deep on applications of artificial intelligence to specific fields, such as health and retail, industry observers say, rather than compete directly with established companies. What you will see is very big players will build platform services, and start-up communities will migrate more to applied intelligent apps, said Matt McIlwain, managing director of Madrona Venture Group. Healthcare start-up Forward, for example, is using artificial intelligence to crunch data that can inform doctors recommendations. For people who really want to focus on core AI problems, it makes a lot of sense to be in bigger companies, said Forward CEO Adrian Aoun, who previously worked at Google. But for folks who really want to prove a new field, a new area, it makes more sense to be separate. AI companies that do remain independent field a steady stream of suitors: Matthew Zeiler, CEO of Clarifai, which specializes in image and video recognition, said he has been approached about a dozen times by prospective acquirers since starting the firm in 2013. Clarifai’s pitch to customers such as consumer goods company Unilever Plc. and hotel search firm Trivago is bolstered by its narrow focus on artificial intelligence. “(Google) literally competes with almost every company on the planet,” he said. “Are you going to trust them with being your partner for AI?” Tech giants have been locked in a bidding war for academics specializing in artificial intelligence. A company with a specialised mission can win over recruits, said Vic Gundotra, chief executive of AliveCor, which makes an AI-driven portable heart monitor. “They say, I want to come here and work on a project that might save my mother’s life,” Mr. Gundotra said.

Tech giants seeking to reinforce their leads in artificial intelligence or make up for lost ground have been the most aggressive buyers. Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google has acquired 11 AI startups since 2012, the most of any firm, followed by Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Facebook Inc (FB.O) and Intel Corp (INTC.O), respectively, according to CB Insights. The companies declined to comment on their acquisition strategies. A spokesman for Apple did confirm the company’s recent purchase of Lattice Data, a startup that specializes in working with unstructured data. The first quarter also saw one of the largest deals to date as Ford Motor Co (F.N) invested $1 billion in Argo AI, founded by former executives on self-driving teams at Google and Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL]. Startups are looking to go deep on applications of artificial intelligence to specific fields, such as health and retail, industry observers say, rather than compete directly with established companies. “What you will see is very big players will build platform services, and startup communities will migrate more to applied intelligent apps,” said Matt McIlwain, managing director of Madrona Venture Group.

Clarifai’s pitch to customers such as consumer goods company Unilever Plc (ULVR.L) and hotel search firm Trivago is bolstered by its narrow focus on artificial intelligence. “(Google) literally competes with almost every company on the planet,” Zeiler said. “Are you going to trust them with being your partner for AI?” Tech giants have been locked in a bidding war for academics specializing in artificial intelligence.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Elizabeth Dwoskin and Craig Timberg By Elizabeth Dwoskin and Craig Timberg May 23 Follow @lizzadwoskin Follow @craigtimberg (AP Photo/David Goldman) SAN FRANCISCO — Google has begun using billions of credit-card transaction records to prove that its online ads are prompting people to make purchases – even when they happen offline in brick-and-mortar stores, the company said Tuesday. The advance allows Google to determine how many sales have been generated by digital ad campaigns, a goal that industry insiders have long described as “the holy grail” of online advertising. But the announcement also renewed long-standing privacy complaints about how the company uses personal information. To power its multibillion-dollar advertising juggernaut, Google already analyzes users’ Web browsing, search history and geographic locations, using data from popular Google-owned apps like YouTube, Gmail, Google Maps and the Google Play store. All that information is tied to the real identities of users when they log into Google’s services. The new credit-card data enables the tech giant to connect these digital trails to real-world purchase records in a far more extensive way than was possible before. But in doing so, Google is yet again treading in territory that consumers may consider too intimate and potentially sensitive. Privacy advocates said few people understand that their purchases are being analyzed in this way and could feel uneasy, despite assurances from Google that it has taken steps to protect the personal information of its users. Google also declined to detail how the new system works or what companies are analyzing records of credit and debit cards on Google’s behalf. Google, which saw $79 billion in revenue last year, said it would not handle the records directly but that its undisclosed partner companies had access to 70 percent of transactions for credit and debit cards in the United States. “What’s really fascinating to me is that as the companies become increasingly intrusive in terms of their data collection, they also become more secretive,” said Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. He urged government regulators and Congress to demand answers about how Google and other technology companies are collecting and using data from their users. Google said it took pains to protect to protect user privacy. "While we developed the concept for this product years ago, it required years of effort to develop a solution that could meet our stringent user privacy requirements," Google said in a statement. "To accomplish this, we developed a new, custom encryption technology that ensures users' data remains private, secure, and anonymous." The announcement comes as Google attempts to weather an outcry from advertisers over how their ad dollars are spent. Google is working to move past an advertising boycott of YouTube, its lucrative video site, after news reports that ads for mainstream brands were appearing alongside extremist content, including sites featuring hate speech and violence. Google for years has been mining location data from Google Maps in an effort to prove that knowledge of people’s physical locations could “close the loop” between physical and digital worlds. Users can block this by adjusting the settings on smartphones, but few do so, say privacy experts. This location tracking ability has allowed Google to send reports to retailers telling them, for example, whether people who saw an ad for a lawn mower later visited or passed by a Home Depot. The location-tracking program has grown since it was first launched with only a handful of retailers. Home Depot, Express, Nissan, and Sephora have participated. “Google — and also Facebook — believe that in order to get digital dollars from advertisers who are still primarily spending on TV, they need to prove that digital works,” said Amit Jain, chief executive of Bridg, a digital advertising start-up that matches online to offline behavior. “These companies have to invest in finding the identity of the consumer at the moment when that shopper is at the cash register.” Tuesday’s announcement gives Google a clearer way to understand purchases than just location and allows them to understand purchase activity even when consumers deactivate location tracking on their smartphones. Google executives say they are using complex, patent-pending mathematical formulas to protect the privacy of consumers when they match a Google user with a shopper who makes a purchase in a brick-and-mortar store. The mathematical formulas convert people’s names and other purchase information, including the time stamp, location, and the amount of the purchase, into anonymous strings of numbers. The formulas make it impossible for Google to know the identity of the real-world shoppers, and for the retailers to know the identities of Google’s users, said company executives, who called the process “double-blind” encryption. The companies know only that a certain number of matches have been made. In addition, Google does not know what products people bought. “Through a mathematical property we can do double-blind matching between their data and our data,” said Jerry Dischler, vice president of product management for AdWords, Google's online advertising service, in an interview. “Neither gets to the see the encrypted data that the other side brings.” The tech giant declined to describe its mathematical formulas in anything more than broad terms, citing a pending patent. Dischler said the work was based on a 2011 research paper by three MIT scientists, which was funded by Google and Citigroup. Dischler described the modeling as a “revolutionary” step forward for both Google and advertisers. He added that users who signed into Google’s services had consented to Google sharing their data with third parties. But the company would not say how merchants had obtained consent from consumers to pass along their credit-card information. Google said it requires its partners to use only personal data that they have the “rights” to use, but it would not say whether that meant the consumers had consented. In the past, both Google and Facebook have obtained purchase data for a more limited set of consumers who participate in store loyalty programs. Those consumers are more heavily tracked by retailers, and often give consent to share their data with third parties as a condition of signing up. Tuesday’s initiative enables Google to use transaction data from a much wider swath of consumers than ever before, but the lack of detail on how personal data was being handled caused concern for privacy advocates. Paul Stephens, of Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, a consumer advocacy group based in San Diego, said only a few pieces of data can allow a marketer to identify an individual, and he expressed skepticism that Google’s system for guarding the identities of users will stand up to the efforts of hackers, who in the past have successfully stripped away privacy protections created by other companies after data breaches. “What we have learned is that it’s extremely difficult to anonymize data,” he said. “If you care about your privacy, you definitely need to be concerned.” Such data providers have been the targets of cybercriminals in the past. In 2015, a hack of data broker Experian exposed the personal information of 15 million people.

They can try a more complicated setup using the advanced modes of the operating system: Beta Mode or Dev Mode – short for developer mode. We’ll show you how to switch your Chromebook to Beta Mode or Dev Mode and back to Stable Mode. The Chromebook offers simplicity that most mobile laptop platforms can’t match. It’s nearly immune from viruses and significant malware. It’s as simple as your browser to use. ChromeOS does face complications, but unlike Windows, macOS or Linux, if a user faces a catastrophic failure, they can simply Powerwash their Chromebook in under fifteen to thirty minutes and it’s back up and running like before with all their apps and settings in place. The simple Powerwash gets a little more complicated for Chromebooks with Android apps installed on them. After the simple restoration process completes, it takes more time to then install the Android apps that the user installed before the Powerwash. Why Switch to Beta Mode or Dev Mode on a Chromebook? Users usually switch their Chromebook to Beta or Dev mode because they want to take advantage of features that Google plans to add to a future version of ChromeOS. These features typically aren’t ready or stable enough for the Stable mode of ChromeOS. For example, the Google Play Store only works on some Chromebooks in Stable Mode, but works on a few more if they’re running in Beta Mode or Dev Mode. Also, the new Settings screen looks cleaner and better organized in more recent builds of ChromeOS, but only shows up in Beta or Dev Mode. If you want Android apps but don’t see the Play Store logo on your ChromeOS Shelf, then you might get the store if you switch to Beta or Dev Mode. Go to the Chromium list of supported systems to find out if your model supports the store yet and in which ChromeOS mode. See the screenshot above. Notice the name of the manufacturer in the first column and the model name in the second. Then see whether your computer has the Play Store and whether it works in Stable, Beta or Dev Mode. Remember that switching to either Beta or Dev Mode will make your Chromebook less stable. If Stable is the most reliable of the three modes, Dev Mode is the least and Beta Mode sits between them on the spectrum of stability. Don’t switch unless you’re ready for some glitches, freezes and apps shutting down without warning. You can lose work and this can get frustrating. I run my Samsung Chromebook Plus in Dev Mode with few problems. Fortunately, if you experience an issue, you can just return to Stable Mode following the steps below. How to Switch to Beta Mode or Dev Mode Before going any further, back up any data on your Chromebook that you want to keep. If your Chromebook has an SD card or micro-SD card reader, then copy files to it using the Files app. You can also upload them to your Google Drive. Click on your Profile icon and then the Settings icon. Open Settings on your Chromebook. Do this by clicking on your user icon in the lower right corner and then choose the Settings icon. It looks like a gear icon and sits above the date in the pop-up box. Click on the About Chrome OS link at the top of the Settings screen. Now click on the About Chrome OS link at the top center of the Settings screen. Click on More info… below the Check for and apply updates button. Click on the More info… link below the Check for and apply updates button. Now, you’ll see a Change channel button in the center of the next screen. Click on it. Choose the Mode you’d prefer and click on the Change channel button. Choose the Mode you’d prefer and click on the Change channel button. Remember that Developer – is the most unstable of the three options. After you pick your mode and click on the Change channel button, then the Chromebook will offer to Restart. The Chromebook will restart and ask you to sign in to “Install a critical update”. Sign in and then choose Update from the dialog box that shows up once it restarts. The Chromebook will install the update and then restart again, erase the drive and install the new version of ChromeOS. How to Return to Stable Mode in ChromeOS What if you’re not pleased with Dev Mode or Beta Mode? You can easily change the channel again and go back to Stable. After you update to Beta or Dev Mode in ChromeOS version 59 or 60, the Settings screens will look very different. Follow these instructions to change channels in the newer version of Settings in ChromeOS. Click on Settings in the Upper Left corner. You still open Settings the same way. Click on your profile icon and choose the Settings icon that looks like a gear above the date. A new box will open. Click on Settings in the upper left corner of the box. Choose About Chrome OS along the left at the bottom of the list. Now click on the About Chrome OS link in the bottom of the list that flies out from the left edge of the Settings dialog box. This takes you to a new screen. Find the Detailed build information item in the new screen in the center of the box. Click on it and then click on the CHANGE CHANNEL button about a third of the way down on the right (see below). Click on CHANGE CHANNEL on the right of the list next to the Channel item in the list. A new box pops up with the three options. To go back to Stable, select it from the list and choose CHANGE CHANNEL AND POWERWASH. Pick your Mode and then click the blue button. You may prefer to try Beta mode, if you’re running Dev Mode and it’s too unstable. Beta Mode will not cause as many problems for as many users as Dev Mode. However, to get a reliable experience with the fewest crashes, pick Stable and then click on the button. The Chromebook may seem to do nothing, but it’s downloading the Stable version of ChromeOS. Give it time. When it’s finished, click on the button that says RELAUNCH AND POWERWASH. The Chromebook restarts and shows a screen telling you that it’s Powerwashing the computer. This erases the system and restarts in factory state as if you just opened and turn it on for the first time.

Google has always been a company run by engineers for engineers. It looks like it’s also going to give some of them a shot at running a venture capital project that will fund research into one of the company’s most central efforts. Axios reported Friday that Google is setting up an investment arm aimed squarely on artificial intelligence, and it seems like it will be separate from Google Ventures, the company’s formal investment organization. Dan Primack reported that the group will be led by Anna Patterson, and will operate almost like an incubator with a shared workspace for AI startups and mentorship from some of Google’s best AI folks. A lot of entrepreneurs are wary of corporate venture capital: just look at the experience of Nucleus, which took money from Amazon to build a voice-controlled tablet powered by Alexa only to see Amazon trot out the Echo Show a year later. But Google is one of the powerhouses of AI research, and it has more enormous data sets for training algorithms than just about anybody.

[Update: Now $75 Off] Deal Alert: Pixel 32GB (international version) is $50 off on eBay Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/05/26 2:20pm PDTMay 26, 2017 2 Plus 1 on G+ 42 Share on Facebook 56 Share on Twitter Total Shares100 Deals News Pixel Update 1: 2017/05/26 2:32pm PDT It looks like the price has dropped another $25, making this a $75 savings in total. For a device that hasn't seen much in the way of price drops or It's no secret that Google has had some serious supply issues with its flagship Pixel phone. That goes for pretty much any combination of size, color, or storage. Rumors even began to surface alleging that Google had stopped production of the devices altogether. That wasn't the case, but nonetheless, you will still struggle to actually find the Pixel if you wish to buy it. A 32GB Pixel (international version) on eBay for $50 off the list price could be the answer to that problem. This is the entry level 5" Pixel, with 32GB of storage in the color Very Silver - and it's available for $599. That's $50 less than the $649 Google is still charging for it. Beware though, this is the international version of the device. So if you live in the US you'll have to check the bands to see if it works on your network. This version won't play nice with Verizon or Sprint, so if you're on either of those carriers you can rule this out. If you live outside the US then this is definitely for you. Shipping appears to be free in the US, but here in the UK, it's $18.99. That still works out a bargain for me, especially if you account for the exchange rate. You'll have to do the sums from where you are to see if the deal is as good for you. It's worth mentioning that getting your warranty honored might be tough with this type of purchase, so bear that in mind. It's hard to say how many of these they have, other than a "limited quantity," so you'll have to be quick if you want to get your hands on arguably the best Android phone of 2016. Update 1: 2017/05/26 2:32pm PDT It looks like the price has dropped another $25, making this a $75 savings in total. For a device that hasn't seen much in the way of price drops or sales since launch, $75 off isn't bad. Anyone interested in a Pixel that uses a network compatible with this international model should give it a serious think.

Middlefinger As a back up phone yeah, its not reliable enough to be a daily driver. Its problems seem to be a mixture of hardware bugs, and Googles poor software QC. me me "bargain" JL "buggy" Gladysrcrosby Managing director of Google!, is explaining to users to start off "Work at home" method, that People have been doing for about one year now. These days alone, I generated close to $36,000 until now with no more than my home computer as well as some spare time, despite that i have a fulltime 9 to 5 job.

It doesnt matter how 'high end' a device is, if it doesn't work properly, its worthless. jonzey231 $50 is worth a guarantee that Google will honor the warranty....trust me...I wish I would've gotten my 6P direct. Andy What do you mean? jonzey231 If you don't buy the phone from Google, they won't help you. They send you to the manufacturer. I was forced to go to Huawei for my 6P and it was a little over 3 weeks before I got it back....and the problem is still there. Spend the extra $50 and buy it through Google so you're guaranteed to get support through their CS channels. You'll be glad you did in 6 months when something inevitably goes wrong. IMHO get the OnePlus 3T. Costs less but has better overall specs aside from the camera which is still pretty good in its own right. My brother has one and my roommate just got his last week and they both have no intention of going back to a major brand ever again. YaKillaCJ Same happened when I got the OnePlus One. It changed the way I (and many others) view a "budget" device from an unknown brand. needa I felt the same way after using an OPO for nearly three years. Got me an XL in mint condition for $450. Google edition even. Still had 3520 mAh in the batt too. Would have bought the black 3T had they been in stock. Took me three days to hunt down this deal. Andy Got my wife the pixel. Runs great. Just had the microphone problem. Google swapped without question. Wife seems to think it takes horrible selfies. Rod Weird, as it's cameras are regarded among the best currently. Random! @andy maybe you should let her know that the camera isn't the problem... It's actually her face. If you do warn her about this, I promise to visit you at the hospital. Andy Thanks for the tip. VAVAMk_2 Huzzah! Master Yates Agreed with you regarding the 3T. Lets see if the excellent updates and support evaporate when the One Plus 5 is released? That's the real test. IcerC Except in this case Google is the Manufacturer, that might change things. VAVAMk_2 Google didn't make the camera. Uses a Sony made sensor but the camera software is Google's and regarded among the best in post processing, particularly HDR. Roy Ahh so nice call me when the 1+2 will get Nougat and your friend will get or never get Android O. ddevito #Fail Andy S8 release response? AdMoc Does not ship to Poland as fck always -_- Random! Look for some service like Shipito. I believe they have an EU warehouse. Shakil Shaikh $60 shipping? kristin ANY Pixel made by google is compatible with any provider. It doesnt matter if its international or not. This writer is an odiot. Scott Scrivens https://www.techwalls.com/google-pixel-pixel-xl-model-number-differences/ Kevin Davis "Odiot", lmao. 😂 Oh, and you're wrong, too. kristin I called google about this. It would be up your phone company provider whether it worked or not. So it may not work with att or tmobile either. kristin This may or may not work on any provider. Its up to the provider. You want a pixel? Go to swappa.com and get one used in mint condition for much cheaper. Ive gotten a few phones from them since ive been on project fi and had no issues. Ill never buy a new phone again. Random! $50 off? How cute... If they get to $300 off ($350 final price) within a month, I might even convince myself it's worth to stare at those bezels everyday. Other than that (impossible) scenario, I'd rather get the 3T, Axon 7, or even the LG G5. Gjorgi Lazarovski The Pixel is probably not dropping in price anytime soon. iKon The most overrated smartphone of 2016. Only the camera is decent. Ugly ass design, overpriced and dull with no features compared to competition Roy You mean the best smartphone of 2016, best camera rare band front, best software, best updates. Great battery, great display. xyz No, he means "The most overrated smartphone of 2016. Only the camera is decent. Ugly ass design, overpriced and dull with no features compared to competition." Roy No, I'm sure he/she means "the best smartphone of 2016, best camera rare band front, best software, best updates. Great battery, great display". iKon No I meant what I said. The pixel is a flop and even Google knows it. No matter how much money they put into advertising there are alot of better choices out there.. only hard core Google fanboys try and big it up Roy Yes yada yada and still every reviewer said is the best smartphone of 2016. So.. even David here. In the on of the day it's a lots about the UI and I just don't like Samsung software. Ordeith LOL. You're such a Google sycophant, Roy. Roy You feeling really smart? I'm Imagine your ass all over your face. nirmitlamed Google is so off track in figuring out what customers wants and competing against the other monstrous companies. I would very much like to hear how many Pixels Google sold in the last year since they told us they sold more than they expected. Lawrence I can put my coffee cup on the Bezel David Nowicki I'm a big Nexus fan, but why would you pay $749 for the Pixel XL vs the OnePlus 3T at about half the price ? And soon the OnePlus 5 at $450 or so with S8+ specs will be a steal compared to the Pixel 4Ui812 Supply and demand. Limit the supply and you increase demand. It's like P.T. Barnum said , "There's a sucker born every minute".

McMaster ‘Not Concerned’ Over Jared Kushner Back-Channel Reports Roku Founder Anthony Wood Roku Roku Roku’s CEO on Netflix, Amazon, Google, and the Future of TV Tom Huddleston, Jr. May 27, 2017 Roku has fared pretty well in a streaming device market where its rivals include tech giants like Amazon, Apple, and Google, to name a few. Despite facing off against those bigger competitors, Roku has been steadily winning the battle for your living room. The streaming hardware company cites Nielsen numbers showing that, as of December 2016, Roku accounted for 48% of the active streaming players in the U.S. (with Amazon, Apple, and Google all trailing behind). Roku currently boasts roughly 14 million active accounts—up 40% year-over-year—and the company says its users streamed 9 billion hours of content last year, a 70% increase from the previous year. The company also posted its highest annual revenue in 2016, reaching $400 million, and sales already topped $100 million in the first quarter of the current fiscal year. One thing that helps Roku stand out is the fact that, unlike many of its biggest rivals, the Los Gatos, Calif.-based tech company relies solely on deals with outside content producers. In other words, Roku doesn't make its own original programming, in contrast with Amazon, Google's YouTube, and others. That means it can stay neutral when it comes to carrying streaming apps and the content it markets to users. As Roku's user base has climbed, the company's focus has shifted somewhat, from selling hardware to generating additional revenue by selling advertising to its many content partners. Advertising and content distribution comprised roughly 75% of Roku's gross profit in the most recent quarter, up from a little over 50% last year, says CEO Anthony Wood, a Silicon Valley veteran and a former vice president at Netflix.

Get One of These First Time Inc.People, Entertainment Weekly Debut New Celebrity-Focused Network ComcastComcast and Netflix Have Buried the Hatchet for Now Roku also has the backing of a handful of major players in both media and tech, with nearly $210 million in reported funding so far from a list of investors that includes News Corp, Viacom, 21st Century Fox, and Netflix. (Wood disputed reports from February suggesting the company was working on a $200 million funding round, telling Fortune that Roku is "well capitalized" at the moment.) Get Data Sheet, Fortune's technology newsletter. Wood recently spoke with Fortune about competing with tech giants in the streaming hardware market, how user data and targeted ads are the "future of TV," and what the evolving landscape of streaming content means for companies like Roku. (The following conversation has been edited for clarity and length.) Fortune: You currently have the largest market share in the U.S. for streaming devices over companies like Amazon, Apple, and Google. How can you maintain that position and keep growing? Wood: If you look at the market share, it has been growing. We had our biggest market share ever in Q1—not just players, also televisions. 48% of active streaming players in the United States are Roku [according to Nielsen], and that number hasn’t changed in about a year. The other half is split between Amazon, Google, and Apple. Our market share is growing fast. It’s growing 40% to 45% active accounts year-over-year and that’s on a big installed base: 14 million active accounts. That comes from players and TVs. We released the Roku Express at the end of last year at $29 and it’s now our number one player. And, last year, one in eight TVs sold were powered by our OS [operating system]. This year, we expect it to be almost one in five TVs—almost 20% of the Smart TV market this year will be powered by our operating system. Roku Ultra— Courtesy of Roku  Roku has been described as "Switzerland" in the streaming devices market because it's content-neutral. How does that strategy help you stand out versus bigger rivals who produce and distribute their own original content? Having a strategy of carrying as much content possible and the most content definitely is a big part of our strategy and works well for us. And we can do it because we’re an independent company. We’re not vertically integrated like our competitors where they can’t carry each other’s content. So we have Amazon Instant Video and Google Play, for example. And, more importantly, we have built the only proprietary operating system for TV. We have the only purpose-built OS for TV and it’s got lots of advantages: it’s better for partners, it costs less to build TVs with our own OS, it’s a better consumer experience, and it has more content. So, I guess we shouldn't expect to see any Roku original programming anytime soon? [Laughs] You’d have to have a lot of scale, even more scale than Roku [with 14 million active accounts]. We have reasonably large scale and are growing quickly, but Netflix has 100 million accounts. So it makes sense for them to do original content. It doesn’t really make sense for us. You mentioned the success of the relatively new Roku Express. How important are those low-cost devices (including Google's Chromecast and Amazon's Fire TV Stick) to the market versus more expensive set-top boxes? What low-cost does is it brings more customers into streaming. That’s one of the things that we saw with the Roku Express is it was so inexpensive that people who hadn’t streamed before said, "Oh, well I’ll give that a go." And, then as they say, "I love this," then I think there’s a decent chance they will, at some point, upgrade to a more expensive product with more features. With that said, the vast majority of unit retail sales are sub-$50 price points. Most of the market is below $50. It’s one of the main reasons Apple is last in market share for streaming players. We have focused on great value for customers from the beginning as a way to gain market share. We introduced the first $100 streaming player. We introduced the first streaming stick, the first $29 player. We have a strategy of driving prices down to make the product more accessible to consumers. Because, for us, hardware is not a business, it’s a way to acquire active accounts. Our business is advertising and content distribution services. Roku Express— Courtesy of Roku  A big part of the advertising platform is tracking what users are watching to compile and analyze that data for targeted ads and content recommendations. It’s super important. The future of TV—both with content distribution and advertising—is based on data and machine learning. And it’s a huge competitive advantage to be good at that. I just want to clarify that the ACR [Automatic Content Recognition] program is opt-in for our customers. We don’t just force it on them, although it has a very high opt-in rate because we have some very cool features that they get access to that are powered by that data. One of those features is called "More Ways to Watch." If you opt in to the ACR data feed—let’s say you’re watching The Big Bang Theory on CBS—it will pop up with an overlay and say "Hey, you’re watching The Big Bang Theory, do you want to watch it from the beginning?" Because it’s available on CBS All Access and also you can watch all of the back episodes, so it gives them more ways to watch that TV show. There are lots of privacy issues around data that we have to be careful about, but it really delivers a much better end-user experience. When it comes to video content, does Roku root for companies like Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon to upend the entertainment industry because it means more people are streaming content and that's good for device-makers? Or, at this point, is most content streaming at some point anyway? The big picture is one of the big drivers of our growth is when more content comes to streaming. Like you said, there’s been an explosion of streaming content. There’s not much you can’t get, if anything, streaming. So, in that sense, we’re completely neutral. We don’t really care. We want to offer our customers choices. I think one of the biggest advantages of streaming, for customers, is that it’s created competition in the TV business, which used to be controlled by a few big distributors and that’s really changed. So, that has resulted in lots of choice for customers: the choice of more content, the choice of not having to watch ads if they don’t want to, they can pay extra or they can sign up for Netflix, or whatever. So that’s all good. Related GoogleGoogle Chromecast Pulls Ahead of Apple TV in Battle for the Living Room Google Google Chromecast Pulls Ahead of Apple TV in Battle for the Living Room I guess we’re not really in anyone’s particular camp. Our biggest focus is just bringing on as much content as we can and keeping our UI [user interface] simple. One of the challenges with a simple UI when there’s so much content is how do you make it easier for customers to find what they want to watch in that sea of content. What are some ways that Roku helps customers manage the deluge of content? We were the first company to offer universal search, so you can search for a program and find out how much it costs and where it’s available and we sort results by price. Another example is we came out with a feature called My Feed, which allows you to follow shows you’re interested in and you’ll get notifications when new episodes come out. What are your thoughts on the proliferation of live-TV streaming services? If they succeed in drawing more consumers away from traditional cable packages, isn't that a game-changer for online content and streaming devices? We’re super positive on those services, because they’re bringing more content to the platform, they bring more people to streaming. We have business deals with all of those services, they buy audience development products, so it’s driving a big increase in our business. But, the dynamics are interesting. They often have overlapping content, so there’s going to be a lot of competition between them. And, I think that will result in better value for the customers. Personally, I am not sure how popular repurposing a linear cable network will be in a streaming environment. Certainly, it's in the millions the number of customers who want it. But is it 100 million, like Netflix? I think that’s an interesting question: whether people have changed the way they want to watch content and what content they want to watch.

Reuters/Kim Hong-Ji Android malware continues to be rampant and the latest word is a new threat called "Cloak and Dagger." Similar to previous attacks, this exploit can gain complete control of an Android phone or tablet with the user fully unaware.  For most, "Cloak and Dagger" may be nothing new when it comes to malware alerts. The damage any exploit can do lies heavily on what he or she downloads from the web or even the Google Play Store.  Also, Google has been known to come out with timely updates to address the situation. But the governing problem right now is that they are still working on a fix, meaning any Android user can get infected at some point.  “We’ve been in close touch with the researchers and, as always, we appreciate their efforts to help keep our users safer,” a spokesperson told Engadget. “We have updated Google Play Protect — our security services on all Android devices with Google Play — to detect and prevent the installation of these apps. According to the full paper describing the “Cloak and Dagger” attack, the exploit would need only two permissions (the System_Alert_Window permission and The Accessibility Service) in the event it is installed via the Google Play Store. Hence, users don’t need to be asked for access and may not even be notified of the changes, BGR reported. Among the problems the malware would bring include clickjacking, unconstrained keystroke recording, stealthy phishing, the silent installation of a God-mode app (with all permissions enabled) and silent phone unlocking + arbitrary actions. From that list alone, one can imagine how Android users may end up helpless at some point moving forward.  For those who are pinning their hopes on the Android 7.1.2, updating to the latest stable version will not help. It seems that “Cloak and Dagger” goes beyond that meaning only Google can come up with a remedy to prevent things from getting out of hand.  Based on the full paper about “Cloak and Dagger,” some short-term recommendations to Google have been suggested. One involves tweaking the permissions for the "System_Alert_Window" which should not be automatically granted even for the Play Store. The other recommendation has to do with Google’s process of approving apps which should be in the Play Store. The permissions need to be looked into closely with manual vetting suggested as a scalable approach. The short-term fix may not be much thought the first one concerned with the "System_Alert_Window" is something Google can immediately revise.

Google may be sued over Nexus 6P early shutdown and bootloop issues Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/04/14 11:09am PDTApr 14, 2017 130 Plus 1 on G+ 337 Share on Facebook 84 Share on Twitter Total Shares551 Android OS Legal Marshmallow 6.0 News Nexus 6P The Android hardware space is fast beginning to look like a watered down episode of Suits. Following on from news earlier in the week that LG is facing a bootloop lawsuit regarding several of its phones, Huawei's Nexus 6P could be responsible for Google encountering a similar inconvenience. As well as being accused of the same bootloop problem that has blighted LG devices, there are reports from consumers that the Nexus 6P has a premature battery shutdown problem. We reported late last year that certain Huawei Nexus 6Ps were suffering from the early shutdown problem, causing them to die with as much as 60% battery still indicated. Now, law firm Chimicles & Tikellis LLP is investigating the possibility of bringing a class action lawsuit against Google on behalf of customers who have faced this issue. Also included in any potential suit would be the same bootloop issue that has also affected owners of the LG Nexus 5X. The problems have mostly been reported by users running Android 7.0 Nougat, but there are also claims that backpedalling to Marshmallow 6.0 on the same devices doesn't fix anything. Neither Google nor Huawei seems to be taking either responsibility or action to resolve issues such as these. While Google is aware of the problems, having assigned both the shutdown and bootloop issues in its tracker, its official position is that those affected by the issue should reach out to customer support for a replacement device. But customers going directly to Huawei about the fault are also out of luck, as they are being told that the problem is with the software and not the hardware, and thus not an issue covered by the manufacturer's warranty - whether it's still in date or not. This is a very frustrating situation for the consumer when neither company seems willing to investigate properly or hold their hands up. Let us know in the comments if any of you Nexus 6P owners have experienced either issue. We'll report back with any further developments as they come in.

Thankfully our Ombudsman financially bullies the carrier until we get a resolution in Australia. Got a free refurb replacement, hopefully won't suffer the same. Matthew Hanson Mine seems to love to die around 10%. As a few others have stated, the low power notification will appear, I will use it for a few minutes and then it powers off. The battery history shows this steep cliff falloff after beginning the recharging and power on. Melad360 i always saw my 6p shut off as soon as the power saving mode came on at 15% battery. this started to happen after an update, i think 7.0 or 7.1, never happened before that though Latheryin This really is a software issue with what they ship out to nexus devices. It also effects the nexus 6 from Motorola. Seems every nexus device that got 7.x has this issue. Packer Backer Nope, doesn't affect the Nexus 6. Provide some links or just don't comment. Latheryin Sorry not a baby sitter. Why not do some research before you post. Also might want to look at the source code and try to understand what you are talking about before posting. abrasive I myself did start to see this issue after about a year, but the device was easily replaced for another warranty-related issue. I would assume my clock was started over again. Not that I haven't seen the same problem on computers with old batteries, but I would hope to get substantially more mileage out of a battery. Nexus 6p Issues Its about time! There are so many issues with the Google branded phones, it doesn't make any sense. We have already reached out to the firm to provide any support they need in accomplishing their potential goal of this class action lawsuit. Its time someone sticks up for the consumers who have been ripped off by this multi-billion dollar company. In the mean time, please follow us on Twitter and sign our petition at Change.org regarding this very issue. We have a lot of signatures and would appreciate your's and your share as well. Thank you in advance! 3fren I'm seeing so many comments about the battery issue going away with just replacing it. I guess I have to give it try. I'm always cautious when it comes to replacing a OEM battery with a replica though. Doug The early shutdown has been an issue on my Nexus 6P ever since I upgraded to Android 7. This has been a frustrating experience - I cannot trust the phone to not die on me when I need it and find myself constant carrying an external battery pack so I can start my phone back up if it dies. P. Sherman Just get an iPhone. It has SIGNIFICANTLY LESS DEVASTATING defects and actually functional software Quality Control team. thereasoner Lol, iOS is the worst when it comes to software issues and iPhone hardware is junk. No Google devices have yet to suffer the nightmares that were error 53 and Touch Disease much less the related class action lawsuits against Apple because of them! Are you trying to be funny? P. Sherman Yeah, no Android devices have had to deal with Touch Disease or error 53. Instead, they spontaneously combust (Note 7,) bootloop for no reason at all (ALL LG'S,) have glass backs that pop out when exposed to a little heat (Xperia Z2 and Z3,) have nearly unusable Bluetooth connectivity (Pixel, Xperia Z5,) heat so badly you can cook an egg on it (every Android that had a massive update,)... I could go on! I'm simply stating that iOS has historically been significantly less buggy and disastrous than Android when a new update rolls around (Think the disaster that was KitKat to Lollipop. The transition from iOS 6 to 7 was SIGNIFICANTLY less dramatic than that in terms of bugs and drains.) Also, Have an open mind and stop automagically trashing the iPhone. The iPhone may be lacking significantly in some areas, but it has two significant advantages - USABILITY AND LONGEVITY. thereasoner Correct, any serious issues facing Android phones have been a one off affecting only one model out of dozens of different models/manufacturers while both device bricking issues found in recent iPhones in error 53 and touch disease affected a much smaller base of phones and just one manufacturer . All the other minor issues you mentioned, be they real or exaggerated, are also very similar to minor issues various iPhones have faced as well its just that it's even worse for iPhones because there are so few models from one manufacturer(and they're still worse) vs several dozens models from over a dozen different manufacturers. That's how bad iPhones are when they have more serious issues despite producing so few models. Issues with Android phone should dwarf those of iPhones by a huge margin considering how many models /manufacturers are involved but they don't, the iPhones still manage to be worse! It's mind boggling when you think about but that's how bad Apple quality is these days. Jon Puhl My 6P is absolutely absurd. It shuts down as high up as 51%, and almost always when the battery percentage is lower than 30%. I'm really upset about this, because it's Google's last Nexus flagship, and it can't even last a full two years without having this dumb battery problem. Daniel Orchard I got a full refund for my 6p, and bought a pixel xl, was out of pocket a little for the upgrade but device was just out of warranty so im still happy with the outcome. Props to Google store support. Yeah i still l got charged the pixel while waiting for the refund, took about 2 weeks to come through but they organised the return shipping etc just like an rma. Im actually really happy. Mine would shutdown between 15-30% and i only lived with that for 2 weeks before starting the process of fixing it. Yes it happened after moving to 7.0 and yes rolling back to 6.x did not fix it so im convinced its software, nfi why they havent rolled out a fix yet. I suggest doing the same because all replacement n6p are still vulnerable to the bug afaik. Morenicano Just wanna make sure I follow, You saying you had your 6P for more than a year and they authorized a refund? I ask because I just reached them for an exchange but if I can get a refund and upgrade to the Pixel, I'll do it. Morenicano Just a heads up, JUST I contacted Google through the support tab in the settings of my 6P and they warranty replaced both mine and my wife's 6P and we bought them through Project Fi in November 2015 with no extended warranty. They said it's a known issue and setup the replacement with no problem and it has next (business) day shipping for the new one and you send the old one back once you have the new one up and running. They do put a hold for the value of the phone on your card while they wait for the old one to come back but they don't charge you Cory Wilson Crybabies. Seriously, my phone developed the issue last week, contacted Google, now I'm rocking a brand new Nexus 6p. Luckily I happened to be on the last day of my warranty but I also got protect so even if I was out of warranty I wasn't paying another $500 again. Just call Google instead of your lawyers dumb asses Packer Backer Wow, a snowflake playing Internet tough guy. Brandon Andrews I had my Nexus 6P become bricked by the bootloop issue. I bought my phone through Best buy and was still well within my 1 year manufacturer warranty when the problem occurred. Unfortunately when I called Best buy customer service and asked how to take care of the situation they told me to send it to this company called Jeg & Sons to get the problem reviewed and a replacement. Needless to say there was like a month long ordeal of mix ups with this company before they finally sent my phone back and told me they don't deal with my phone. Finally I eventually figured out I needed to send my phone to Huawei and they replaced my phone no problem. Sarah Despars I've never had this issue with my 6p so far. Hopefully it doesn't start! k_nonymous I experience this exact same problem and it drives me nuts. Battery saver mode on my 6P is supposed to be activated at 15% battery. The phone shuts off before it ever gets to that point. Also, 95% battery life is equivalent to 1h 5m???? Packer Backer Well well, according to thereasoner he thinks it's your fault. gparmar76 This is 100% hardware related...If it was the OS, it would be a widespread issue across all Android 7 handsets...Huawei is using cheap batteries... People who like the phone should go buy a replacement from a company like Zero Lemon (if available)..Or just buy another stock battery. Kirkster My Nexus 6P is 11 months old, and so far the only anomaly I've had is that it spontaneously factory-reset while in my pants pocket about two weeks ago, which was annoying. I recovered from the cloud backup, which restored all my apps, settings, etc, and my photos were set to back up to Google photos. I lost my call log and SMS messages though, but luckily most of my messaging is via WhatsApp (which restored everything). Still, annoying. I now have a SMS+call log app installed in case it happens again. No battery problems *yet*, now I'm dreading the one-year mark, after reading all the comments. Chalet_Badger My 6P bootloops, i can get it to start normally when the battery is ~5% or so but it will freeze and start to bootloop about a minute or two after. Duane I've had no issue with my 6p. Sounds like an annoying issue from the comments here. Robert B I've been having this problem for a few months now...I carry external battery around all the time because you never know when it feels like it's going to shut off and not turn back on Packer Backer According to thereasoner, it's your fault. clarence jones My 6p did not have the random shutdown at a certain percent issue before. After the 7.1.2 update it would crash and restart when the camera app was opened. About two days after the update it started boot looping and nothing i have tried has gotten it to successfully boot again. Packer Backer Tell thereasoner because he thinks it's your fault. Spudos Woah I thought this was just me. My ending battery life varies wildly, sometimes dying at 15% and on bad days dying around 40-50%. I would replace the battery myself but the teardown process looks like it requires an electrical engineering degree. Packer Backer thereasoner thinks it's your fault. Maybe you should straighten him out. Đức Thành Maybe Google deserves to be sued. Kyle Zess I am plagued by this issue. My phone shutdown after 5 minutes of non charging use. Packer Backer thereasoner thinks it's your fault. David Vogt Only time mine would shut down early at 30% or less is if I was out in freezing cold weather, phone just didn't like freezing weather, keep it warm and it's fine blueman24 Just admit it that your "quick charge" bs killed the battery early. Truth hurts huh My Nexus 6p 128 was barely a year old and it never recovered from the bootloop issue where it would keep restarting and not getting past the Google screen then restart over and over, losing precious pictures and videos of my children. My sister's Nexus 5 eventually broke from the bootloop issue 3 months later. We both had the $80 warranty but it seemed unfair having to pay for a replacement REFURBISHED Nexus 6p when the damage was caused by bad software. Sucked how although Nexus/Google/Huwei knew of ongoing repeated problems a 6 -9 months earlier, yet FAILED to try to resolve or prevent the recurring boot loop issue from infecting more phones. Finally, a lawsuit is in place. Damani Boyce After 7.1.1 update my Nexus 6p got bootloop an can't be fixed shame on them not even a reply from Google or Huawei. thereasoner Many on here are saying that they had no problem getting it fixed/replaced. Packer Backer Yeah, it's ALL his fault.... Posts like yours make some people dream of twisting your head off. thereasoner Why would you say it's his fault? Smoking one to many fatties?, Lol. Razed Mine currently dies at around 10%. I use it moderately and have had it since launch. Got Nexus Protect, but that seems worthless as all reports are that using that service will just get me an even worse battery. thereasoner My Pixel has been great, I'll have to ask a friend at work about his 6p to see if he's having issues. By the sounds of it only a small percentage of devices are affected. Packer Backer Nexus 6 by Motorola was a better direction. Gordon Mine would shut off at 25% consistently. I called Huawei and they actually replaced the battery for free. I had to pay for shipping 1 way, but the covered the rest. I got my phone December 2015, and it was just replaced this February.

Gordon Canada Trey Bradshaw I haven't encountered any bootlooping and my phone doesn't shut off unless my battery drops to about 2%. olivrstal happens to my 6p quite a bit as well :( hope it's gonna make it till the pixel 2 comes out :D mrjoeyloke My wife just got the bootloop of death on her 6p. I think that might be a whole different issue though. Kuldeep Choudhary This happens when a gaint company like google hires a Chinese company to manufacture it's top line product. I'm using my motorola nexus 6 for 2.5 years and still not a single problem im facing and decided to keep it for 1 more year. Omar Al Matar Had the problem, I was out of warranty, called them, no frustration or arguments, 5 minutes i had the email to get my new phone, and i sent them the one i had, i was even out of the country. Now I got it to last me another year, so idk about y'all Kristen Oliver This happened with me until I replaced the battery... At my own cost. Funnily enough that is not a software issue 12321 Please click the links below for details of my experience, which is echoed by thousands of other Nexus 6P owners.

Sue them! Merxury My Nexus 6p died, it stuck at bootloop every time when I turn on my phone. Sara Bales I've had the Huawei Nexus 6P since July of 2016, purchased new in the box. It started randomly shutting down within weeks, often multiple times a day. It was annoying and inconvenient, even shutting down once when I was on a 911 call reporting an intruder in the garage (talk about chaos. . . I had to wait for it to reboot and call again). My phone entered the "boot loop of death" the last week of March. The first 6 or so crashes, it rebooted just fine. But then it started getting hung up on the rainbow google animations, until finally it wouldn't even push past the Google screen. I was able to pull up the barcodes but other system reboots were useless. Since my phone is still under warranty, Huawei agreed to repair it but I had to wait 5 days for a label from UPS. It's been almost 3 weeks and I've heard nothing. They also didn't offer to send a loaner phone. At least mine was under warranty, I see on the forum that Google and Huawei have refused to help and neither want to accept responsibility. Ron Nguyen My 6p shutdown prematurely everyday but at different battery percentages. Mostly around 30%, but I have had 40, 50s and 60. Anunnaki A battery replacement fixes the early shutdown problem. Sriidhar sriidhar My 6p died couple of weeks ago and Google and Huawei must be sued for not taking the responsibility, I'm a student and I saved a lot of money to buy the phone but now they're like, it's not our concern as you're out of warranty! Konstigt2 Very good, they should have issued a recall and fixed them all. To not have your phone avail when you need it in case of emergency could be fatal. I have gotten my battery and screen replaced and that fixed it for me. arpit saxena My 6p shutdown few months back, after bootloop and hasn't been turned on since them. Both companies failed to address the situation and to fix the fault Huawei asks for 400$. I don't seem to find any kind of Justice in this area. David Berry All you poor nexus folks hot rolled. High price.shite processor thats had issues in every phone its been put in & sealed in battery copping quick charge for 12months through then the new usbc port then add that to the Chinese manufacturer &issues that causes with returns & you have a massive recipie for disaster. So is your nexus 6p still beter than an s7e or note5or7?Maybe the little fire issue puts it on a par with note 7 just but with that 810 inside it was always doomed from the start. No wonder they canned it for the now overpriced pixel. I think id rather a umi z plus for under half the price. So wheres the samsung haters now? I hate them too but they do make the best phones once you tweak this & that & set it up right. My note5 died after 18 months too. It did cop a real hammering as a wifi hotspot for a while there though. It used to get real hot with a few people connected at once & my bro never let it rest & would run it hot & flat every day. Sometimes 2x a day so it was to be expected. I got 2 note 7s for Sweet f%$ck all & a free s7e from samsung so ill forgive them a little & send back my note5 in the fire proof box & keep the other note 7 as a spare & as compensation for losing all my music &stuff on the note5& the fiasco of the n7recall. Sealed in batteries suck unless you replace your phone every 18months. Boy Ling Mine shuts down at 33% maybe 8 Times out of 10. I never updated to android 7. Mandeep Singh Pannu Mine normally dies off at 30%, then I connected it to charge, it comes back on at 30%.... Also I live up north in the UK, and at early in the morning, if I go out, and it's too cold it just dies randomly theadamsegal Very disappointed with Google. My Nexus 6P started shutting off at around 20% less than a year after I purchased it. The basically pulled an Apple with the release of the Pixel. After purchasing 3 Nexus phones in 4 years, I won't be buying a Google handset again. Ashwini Kumar Same issue here. Phone dies suddenly at 10-15% without any warnings. I love the phone but battery is pathetic. I barely get 10 hours on light usage. I hate apple but the 6s plus from work would be at 50% battery at the end of the day. First google deserted the nexus brand and then not honouring the issue. Disappointed! Sean Stone I'm currently replying from my just received RMA replacement for the boot loop issue. My warranty was technically up in November but the Google Tech Support hooked me up anyway. Better outcome than I was expecting. Thomas Boel Mine shut's down at round about 20%, but only when the screen is turned on! The warning comes and immediately it starts shutting down. Maggie Smith I don't get any warning. It just reboots at random. I wish I did get a warning. David Schleifstein Shuts down at 15% for me, closer to 30% for my wife's. I also noticed that a short time in colder temperatures can cause the battery to drop dead at 50% and up. Ger PG How is this affecting users? David McFee Same issue. Daily premature shutdown. So annoying. Jon Watts Get a grip people. It's just a phone. If it doesn't work just get a new one. I've had the 6P since its release in 2015. Yes I've had a few issues but nothing that didn't eventually get fixed. Dirge Yeah, all those thousands of people that suffer from this problem better just get a grip. So Google sold a defective product, so what? Go buy another one. Duh. "I'm not having any problems therefore these people need to get their shit together." *Rolls eye's* Drew Harden https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/fff14c9ec4b9b4966ae37554f13b373d9bfa270aa644c3e5ef01a5fca3723410.png Mine usually shuts down when the phone is pretty cold and then I turn the screen on and then it just dies. In the warmer weather it still dies with 15% every time though. If I start a Snapchat video below 20% it's instantly off. Dan Molina I haven't had a shut down at 60% but I get it at 25% pretty consistently. Bootloop is rare too; however, I do get random restarts usually while on a phone call. Danny Mestriner Good, maybe they will finally get off their lazy asses and treat us like actual customers. I also have the shutdown issue since Nougat. Philip Quach I've had the same issue even after factory reset. It's especially bad when the temperature outside is cold. I'm really disappointed with Huawei and Google about this. Artūras Rimonis Having the same issue. It always shuts down at 15% or even more. Cara Buttitta sometimes mine dies at 20% sometimes at 60%. just today my 6p was at 90%, I took one picture without the flash and it shut down. very frustrating David Perez Yes, it's been an issue since nougat, from what I recall. Both Nexus 6p devices I have suffered from increased battery drain, and sudden shutdown anywhere from 15 to 25%. Google points to Huawei, Huawei points to Google. I downgraded one device back to marshmallow. Battery drain is still pronounced, but at least no shutdown. I get my warning at 15% and can run until the single digits. John Adams Will die between 20-35% every time, also randomly restarts at around 50%. This phone has been plagued with bugs since release... Jordan Hindley https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/0aef98131463828edbc4ecec53b90938738636b0a4ab26649126e2b51247d48d.png My device shuts down at lots of different battery percentages and won't reboot until i attach to a power source. It's a nightmare. MeanBeans I get that all the time as well even after I changed the battery Mike I Easy. Have Google make their own phones. Call them, oh, Pixel? I'm writing this on my lg5x with 7.1.2. Very happy with it, but will take 200 off coupon on the LG g6 against any and all future 5x claims. Seiga Is it safe to say I should utilize my Nexus protect? I too am suffering from this issue. CJ Nexus 6p start shutting down with 1 to 2 times a day, which increase to more than 10 times within 3 month..huwaei and Google blaming each other for issues..phone is under warranty, but can't do anything.. Miresnare Love my 6p. Never had an issue with it apart from the slo-mo on the camera. Wonderful device. Rob Paek My 6P shut off abruptly right after it gave me the 15% warning the other day. Other than that it has been freezing lately and forcing me to reboot. lance colton Suing is great and all, but every AMERICAN class action lawsuit does absolutely nothing for those of us that aren't in the USA. All the times Nvidia and Sony got sued for stuff they sold me that didn't work as advertised, I'm entitled to NOTHING. This phone is such garbage. Just got it back from the bootloop repair, and the battery starts dying at 20% left. Then 40%. Yesterday, 60%. WTF. I don't think it's Google's fault, though. They would have fixed the software if they can by now. More like Huawei built this thing out of garbage, so it actually needs to be replaced after a year. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/776a4957bbcf9a86578fe290eba3107f160fabf3d0d520adb81993f61d67cca0.png You wouldn't believe the trouble I had getting this thing in for repairs either. I bought it from my carrier so I can't deal with Google or Huawei. They do troubleshooting but for warranty I have to deal with 'Freedom mobile'. I have to go into a certain shopping mall and go to a specific kiosk that is a designated repair center. They refused to honor the terms of the warranty, specifically that the original bootloop repair gives me 90 days more warranty. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/735c6d189c2684ae884f4c97c0d443766058dfa8c7119577c26c17b6da30b031.png Even the Huawei website says it's under warranty for a few more days. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/63182bf80270d912f90486d64178eff22d06e6ef98c0bbc1b1c6fcad3b6f4c62.png I had to give up at the kiosk, go to my car, and phone 611. Talked to an idiot that wastes my time with irrelevant troubleshooting, then she tries to tell me the warranty is expired too. Ask for a supervisor. Same story, but she speaks better English. I argue with her that they need to honor the terms on their website, but she says I'm not understanding them. I refuse to give up, she finally places me on hold for 5 min, comes back, admits I'm correct. I still have 3 days warranty according to her now. She puts a note on the account, then I go back to the kiosk, tell the guy there to read the note and finally he calls his manager, and figures out how to process the claim. If they didn't glue the stupid thing together, I'd replace the battery myself. They choose to make it un-repairable, they can fix it. Jeremy Miethker that means its going to bootloop soon. that is what happened to me Cindy Up until the April 2017 update, I was experiencing this same issue. My Nexus 6P would die with as much as 23% battery life left. oscar acevedo Oh that explains why my phone unexpectedly shuts down from time to time. Nexus 6P v7.1.2 blenderboy People still buy google devices like Pixel. Consumers vote with their money. The moment you buy a device you are promoting the brand. I don't think there will be any outcome for this lawsuit. This is just a publicity stunt. Samsung hardware is great, software is shit. Google software is ok but hardware partners do not work properly with Google(initial supply, firmware updates, warranty replacements). I am waiting for Pixel(maybe in 2 yrs) after seeing how current Pixel owners are treated by Google. Apple hardware is great, software works as expected. I use Linux at home and without itunes it is difficult to use a iPhone. So only option for me is Android. Charles Jordan I have the Nexus 6P a lotnd I have no issues and it's all updated. ThEGr33k Sent mi e of for RMA in the UK they did a "software update" to android 7 and sent it back. Safe to say the early shutdown and terrible battery life is still here... Have sent an email asking for the battery to be replaced so see what i hear back... Felipe I had my 6P fallen into the bootloop problem, I was given a replacement as Huawei honored its 15 months warranty (even though the documentation everywhere says it has 12 months factory warranty, it in fact has 15 months, with Huawei, but NOT with Google, shame Google!). Now, I'm about to get this replacement unit and pray, really pray hard that nothing new appears with this phone. Even tough there are now reports of replaced phones crashing again into the bootloop bug and, recently that Android 7.1.2 final, screwed the fingerprint sensor. Many are not liking the way Google+Huawei (yes, both) is handling this crisis, which in fact is a major one. I think customers who spent lots of hard earned money should get a quality device which keeps on working well, even after its warranty period expired and, wheren there is a well known massive problem, the manufacturer(s) Hardware+Software should honor fixes or reimburses, despite the fact that there are now the Pixels phones. If my replacement phone fails, I'd be more than willing to participate in a class action suit. Jeremy Miethker my brothers replacement phone already went into bootloop 5 days after receiving it. my phone died last week. Jacob Kraniak I thought I was going crazy when I noticed my 6P constantly rebooting on it's own. At least now I know I'm not alone with htis issue. Hopefully they give us something back in return. Maybe a replacement? Hell, I'd rather just return it at this point and use whatever credit they give me towards a Pixel or OP3T. that's not to say I haven't loved the 6P of course. Alexander Dumo Ive had this issue since updating my 6P sometime this past December. We shouldn't have to live with charging our phone before it hits approx 15%-20% battery life. When that warning pops up, the phone just shuts down. Make no sense...please fix this Huawei/Google! Charles Constantine I reported shutdowns at battery levels of 20-60 percentage remaining and was given a list of things to do including a "factory reset" and then told to report back by Google Project fi support. ARDankar I am glad I did not upgrade to nougat yet. Keep me posted on any news regarding issues with the Nexus 6P. David Droddy The Goog replaced my 6P very quickly when I demonstrated the sudden shut down problem even in safe mode and after full factory reset. Why would you report that Google is not responsive to this issue? Seanmiz Yep, I've experienced both issues on my 6P. I got hit with the bootloop of death a few months ago, luckily still under warranty with Huawei and got a replacement. I get the early battery shutdown usually in the 10-20% range. prwnd https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/cd48abb593ae6c1dd226cbe06ba45cf7195abd40318303b2290ca9229846939e.png Biojoe Me too. Travis Coble Oddly enough, sometimes it shuts down early, and sometimes it's fine. However, given my use of it and constant recharging, I'm convinced that this will end up going nowhere because the problem is actually pretty normal for devices that are going on two years of age due to the use of LIon batteries. People claiming shutdown at 60%? I'd need to see it to believe it... maverick7526 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/3b98bc27cfb84fed5d59d503e403949c6d1cd50a18f37dd23dc58235aba80ad6.png It happens. It happened to me in Feb. It was very cold out and the phone just shut off, and would not turn on again until it was plugged into a charger. Brett Crowley Mine just hit a random boot loop and recovery mode is not working. Jeremy Miethker once it bootloops there is nothing you can do. it is now a cool paper weight Hussain Ahmadi I really hope they sue google for this. 6P keeps restarting without any reason, not to forget the excessive freezing issues. Google is getting very arrogant and need some spanking Hussain Ahmadi And of course this will be the last phone I've ever buy from google. Waiting eagerly for Note 8 mercado79 Yes, both issues. The battery issue was covered under warranty directly by Google. The bootloop issue occurred 1 month out of warranty and both companies told me there​ was nothing they could do for me. Marcin Nowak I had this issue since beginning of the year and Google forums just said wait for update. Finally contacted Google about it just last week feed up asking for help and they told me to F.off pretty much. zefred Got it. It started RIGHT after the one year mark. Contacted google AND Huawei, and was turned down by both. My N6p doesn't even last half a day with recharging. I need to carry extra external batteries everywhere with me, as well as a charge and cable, and the device is barely a year and a half old. NOT a happy camper :( 12321 Law360, Dallas (April 17, 2017, 5:29 PM EDT) -- Google Inc. and Huawei Technologies USA Inc. were hit with a putative class action in Texas federal court Friday over an allegedly defective smartphone, the Nexus 6P, which the user claims suffers from premature battery drainage. Plaintiff Alex Gorbatchev wants to represent a class of consumers who bought the Google Nexus 6P phones, which he says also suffer from a problem that sends the phone into a “death spiral” in which the phones suddenly switch off and then restart in what is referred to as an... https://www.law360.com/texas/articles/913933/class-hits-google-with-suit-over-defective-nexus-phones https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bad-Cellphones.pdf Claude L Now it's getting worst with android 7.1.2. I was also experiencing early shutdown with my 6p when using 7.1.1. But now I'm unable to use my phone on a daily basis without having a early shutdown. Today again battery was at 20% and last week it happened at 37%. I was so happy when I bought my phone a year and a half ago because I was able to use it for the whole day without having to charge the battery... Now I have to carry a charger with me... It sucks theadb Anything we can do in Canada? Mine just shuts off randomly all the time. This is was a RMA from an older 6P that had massive battery issues. The guy I just spoke to said my original warranty was up in January this year and there was nothing he could do. This phone shuts down randomly all the time now. I've missed by alarm to wake up twice now because it just shuts off. Only way to power it back on is to go into bootloader and restart. adi sararu mine had his 20% dying today first time... and after reading above... my time to never touch google phones again :D Steve I had same battery problem with my 6p, rather than taking out a lawsuit against Google I just purchased a new battery and replaced it. Phone no longer has the issue, lawsuit closed Kyle Snider Phone shuts off early on me allllllll the time, does this lawsuit affect us in Canada? Adam Macias I'm suffering the premature battery death. I have yet to cross the boot loop issue though. God help me if I do. Jeremy Miethker well im a not so proud owner of a $800 dollar paper weight. i cant believe how this is being handled they want me to spend $550 to replace it than they will reimburse me. are you kidding me. however was wondering if this would happen again if i did get a new one? Jacob Lunsford My 6P shuts down with anywhere from 10-30% battery remaining. pi app my problem is the uber driver app stopped working on this phone about 2 weeks ago (same app was working fine on this phone for last 8 months). when i log into uber driver app on any other fine it works fine. a chinese person told me because huawei is a chinese company and they hate uber they may have done something to prevent the app from working on their phones. i was going to buy another nexus 6p to see if same problem occurs. then i will know. my battery's been fine with my phone. Svart Adam Solander My phone shutdown at around 20-25%. Quite annoying. sleepytinksy Also have this issue - phone shut down right before the gates opened for a soccer match and they only issued digital tickets, scan-able on the phone. As you can imagine, that was less than ideal. Panda without dark circle My 6p shut down at 35% or below when I travel to Japan on winter, I thought it was because of the cold. But when I back to Malaysia, it shut down at 60% or below, not every time but this scared me. :( And yes, it doesn't warning me at all, shut down without any sign. Ahmad Zaib I am from India and facing the same issue on my Nexus 6P. The Huawei customer care response has been that they are coming up with an official response soon. This has been the status since more than 3 weeks now. Anyone here, who knows what can we expect here or how do we proceed? Tom Z 71% (seventy-one percent) Shutdown! Mine just hit a new low (or high) with this issue. I just had mine shut down at 71% (seventy-one percent) remaining battery life. This is a very big problem. I was taking pictures when the phone just went into shut down. I couldn't get it to stay running until I connected power. This needs to be fixed! I'm on the latest version with April 2017 security updates. Tom boses Same issue here. I'm reaching the shutdown at about about 38% mark! I'm frustrated at Google's inaction! Jay Miller Mine has died anywhere from 43% to 15%. It is random battery percentage for the shutdown, but it always claims it is at 15% then shuts down. The minute you plug it in and turn it on, the battery percentage is what it really shut off at, and it is usually in the high 20's. So yesterday I tried something. I went to the factory images I had for my Nexus, and through ADB, I sent it "back in time" to Android 6.0 (original release firmware). I then put it to the test. I turned on the hotspot and started playing games that I know drain the battery. I got the warning at 15%....no shutdown. I continued further. I got a warning at 14%, at 12%, 10%, 5% and eventually it shutdown at 1%. I placed it on the charger and fired it up and it was "truly" at 1% battery. I haven't seen it fully drain in months. While the claim that new batteries work, it also appears that Google has work to do on their end as well. Reversing the firmware did work for me. However, the device wanted to update immediately. I accepted the security patch, but at this point in time I will refuse to upgrade back to Nougat if I can gain the full use of my phone without it shutting off prematurely. Here is my log: Firmware I was on 05/03/2017 at 11 AM Eastern US time: N2G47H (April 2017 Security Patch) Firmware I reversed it to on 05/03/2017 at 12 PM Eastern US time: MDA89D (September 2015) Firmware after accepting most recent security patch OTA on 05/03/2017 at 6:45 PM Eastern US time: MTC19T (Android 6.0.1 but security is May 2016) Mister Sonny I'm having the early shutdown issue, for me it's consistently at around 25% battery life. This is made worse by the fact that I have an accessory almost always connected (Fitbit Blaze) NumbGrip I've been having this problem since about 6 weeks ago and it started completly out of nowhere Vince Romeo I've encountered the boot loop problem on 6p after <18 mo. Occasionally sudden shutdowns before that happened. My wife's phone is ~19+ and has sudden shutdown issues. Darshan Jain I am facing the same bootloop issue and my phones warranty has expired and Huawei and Google refused to help Shailla Chand My phone will be fresh off the charger at 100% and shut down within 15 minutes. Talk about frustrating.. Gerbil My 6p has been losing power at alarming rate always with Android system and Android OS at the top. Then it began randomly shutting down an demanding to be charged after sending a notification my battery hit 0% when I was well above 40% and failed to detect my SIM card for about 3 hours. I down own a power bank so I'm really suffering here as my phone dies midday and I can't use it for the latter half of the day. chesterbr Now that you mention... I (a no-bootloop-but-frequent-shutdown-at-30% Nexus 6P user) had a couple failures on SIM card detection. Not sure how long they lasted, removing and reinserting seemed to have done the trick... keeps one wondering... :-/ rpeltz My Nexus 6p shuts down when the battery drops below 49 percent. This can happen in as little as an hour of idle time and the phone is just over 1 year old. Cassy Forrester I had the shut off issue. It was shutting off at 99% after a couple of weeks of only shutting off at 48% and below. Still ridiculous. Anyway, I bought it through Newegg so I had to deal with huawei.. biggest fucking pain in the ass. We waited 22 days for a shipping label. Called on a thursday and they said by Monday it would be emailed. Still didn't come. Called again and they said another few days. Didn't come. Called AGAIN and after 5 hours of being on the phone (that day alone.. 15 hours total), they sent the email with the label. I sent it in and like 4 business days later it was returned.. same phone I sent it.. doesn't shut off anymore.. BUT they told us it was a software issue and that they couldn't fix the phone so they would have to replace it. Clearly they didn't replace it but it doesn't shut off so that's good right? Well no. Now my phone is not charging if I use it while it's on the charger... Also, I get the warning when it boots that it can't be checked for corruption. Fuck these people. Fuck this phone. My warranty was up by the time they sent the label but they did say they are taking phone's after warranty because they are having so many issues with this phone.. (also why they took so long to help me) Well no wonder they're taking them! They are only half ass fixing them. So if a half ass fix is worth it to you, call them. They might help. This is the US in case that helps. iRulLezZ My 6p shutted down with full battery and restarted all the time ! Nothing happes ! Pghgeek My 6p has the issue. Powers off before battery is low. Won't tun back on until connect to a charger then shows 40 to 60% battery. Have to use another phone. Don Smith My 6p purchased 11/2015 has been the most fantastic phone i've ever had but hey. Now i noticed that i never get the battery saver time. Then i researched. my phone is shutting down at 56% batter. Of course there is no warning that this is coming. So it's only useful if i'm plugged in at home, the car or traveling with my anker battery pack, Thank you anker. My exeperience with trying the warranty once is that it's worse than worthless. Details for file a clain, time passes then a letter that your claim is denied. Seems rediculous. Better to know you don't have warranty than wast your money only to be frustrated. I'm ready to give up on android and an unreliable beta company. but add me to the list of sabotaged 6p lovers. Kelly Kay Mine shuts down at 25% without fail. Robert Hynes I still have the shutdown issue....anywhere from 60 to 20%. Unlikely I will get a pixel or other Google device unless there is a fix. Maybe we just need a more high profile device like a Samsung in order to get noticed. Jeffrey Huston I started experiencing this for the first time on my Nexus 6p shortly after installing Android 7.1.2. It can happen anywhere from 20% to even 60%, and happens multiple times daily. I've had the phone for probably a year and am generally always on the latest Android version. I don't think it started immediately; might have started a week after installing 7.1.2. I initially blamed an app or a Google play services update, but I've been factory resetting my phone three times now, each time reinstalling and updating fewer and fewer things to see if it would stop happening. It hasn't stopped yet. My next step was going to be factory resetting and doing zero app installs and updates (then it's basically just a phone, gross), but then I stumbled on this article. Now I'll probably skip that next factory reset and see if Google will send me a new phone. Hans Breda I contacted Google Support about this issue. They were very cooperative and are sending me a replacement! Hope this will solve the problem. chesterbr I did not have the bootloop, but phone would shutdown anywhere below 30%. After reading some experiences here I got my battery replaced at a local shop (Mobile Klinik in Toronto, CAD$ 60 plus tax, service done in 1-hour, no data loss or anything), and the problem is GONE: phone goes down to 1% at a steady pace. Normal usage gives me an entire day, just like it did when I purchased it. I'll be sad if a class action lawsuit earns something (not for the money, but for the principle), but it seems it will give my phone at least another year of life (heck, possibly more, this phone is a beast).

Google is now offering four free months of Google Play Music for new subscribers Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/26 2:17pm PDTMay 26, 2017 70 Plus 1 on G+ 511 Share on Facebook 83 Share on Twitter Total Shares664 Google News Right now it looks like Google is running a special offer for Google Play Music. New subscribers that sign up here can get four free months of service instead of the usual three. No telling how long this offer might last, so if you have been considering subscribing, now might be the time to do it. It could save you an extra $10. Again, this particular offer is only for new subscribers. I've been a fan of Play Music for a long time, though the device removal limit does get in the way when you switch between devices and ROMs as often as I do. Being able to mix your own library with those of a service also comes in handy. That way I can continue to support artists I am passionate about, without eschewing the larger selection of a subscription offering for the purposes of content discovery, all while being able to fill the gaps in that library. There are a lot of different music services out there, but if you're interested combining your curated library with music available via a subscription, then your options are limited. Spotify does allow you to play back locally stored files, which is convenient, but it isn't quite the same. Amazon also allows you to upload your music for playback via Amazon Music, and with Amazon Prime membership, you get a small library of streaming music to go along with that. For $10 a month ($8 for Prime members) you can access their full library as well. But, Google Play Music has a great interface and plugs nicely into all the other Google services we love. Maybe with this new offer, it's time you gave Google Play Music a chance? After all, even if it doesn't end up working out, you still got four free months of music out of the deal.

Carson Saldanha Wait, wdym 3 different countries? Did you share it with others or something? Ailín Ó’S I live in Ireland, so that's my main account. I have a secondary account based in England as part of a mail forwarder service I use, and my bf is Greek so I had him check the code on his account :) Carson Saldanha Oh wow! Carson Saldanha Hey, since I know it worked for you, are you able to use YouTube Red along with this Play Music free trial? Because my YT Red doesn't seem to be enabled for me. Ailín Ó’S No, unfortunately not as I live in the EU and YouTube Red is only available in USA. Carson Saldanha Weird, I'm in the US though. Ailín Ó’S Ooh that is odd. Sign out of the app then sign back in maybe? Carson Saldanha No luck :( I'm in contact with Google support atm Hopefully they can sort this out Mike Worth it alone for Youtube Red MisterAlex Sweet, I wasn't sure if that was included. Thanks. Should mention that in the main blog post. Ben Still no student membership >:( Ailín Ó’S Spotify is a great alternative @€$£5/month. Ben I know that's what I use just because it's half the price. Ailín Ó’S In Ireland Vodafone have a partnership with Spotify whereby it costs €5 standard instead of €10 regardless of if you're a student or not, they even bundle it with some of their plans. Vodafone do the same in some other countries they operate in (not all). Maybe see if any network in your country has a partnership like that? Worth a shot! Ben Oh yeah I'm on EE in the UK and I've got Apple Music for free for 6 months but like iTunes is a massive stinking turd. Ailín Ó’S I'd rather go back to the days of getting music via Bluetooth from friends than use crApple Music 😂😂 Rahul Krishna In india, we have play music for 1.4 usd/month Umang Ladia I'm only seeing 2 months offer in India.?? Rahul Krishna Well I subscribed to it when it launched here (about 2 months ago), so I can't confirm that. But at this price, there is nothing to be disappointed about. aRvInD I wish Spotify launches soon here. I can't keep using that patched version here...!! Rahul Krishna Me too xyz As it should be, you can't charge European or American prices in India. Rahul Krishna Yes true. There are lots​ of people here with a very cheap Android phone. They cannot pay much money. Julian Coronado That's actually what's keeping me away from Play Music. I've used my free months and I loved the Youtube Red too. But as a student, Spotify for $5 / month is too great to pass up on. Emiliejmosley Google is paying 97$ per hour! Work for few hours & have longer with friends and family! !sm141c: On tuesday I got a great new Land Rover Range Rover from having earned $8752 this last four weeks.. Its the most-financialy rewarding I've had..

Cakefish Spotify ftw ToniCipriani ✓pǝᴉɟᴉɹǝʌ I don't think this is a new offer, got this a while back. In fact my 4 months is expiring next week. Prefer Spotify over it. Song selection a tad bit weaker, and for foreign songs it tries to translate the song names to English and makes it hard to look up. folkrav I like it, it's way cheaper than Spotify for me - my mother, my sister, my wife and myself each pay 30$ a year and we're set - but Jesus do I hate the clients. I don't like the website's interface, I hate the Android app. But yeah, I'll deal with it cause it's cheap, I guess. Carson Saldanha Got it! Yay! Jim I wish I could somehow get it on my Amazon Echo hahaha. I guess if I had paid for a Google Home it would be worth trying out. Forget vega #getEVGA Why google play music isn't available in my country ? Ailín Ó’S Try Apple Music? They seem to be just about everywhere. Iamsecond And this is why Apple continue to dominate, because Apple are truly interested in being an international company whereas Google is just playing at it. Such a shame xyz Because Google sucks. Bartek Juszczak My GPM radio's are so good these days I love that Google is so into AI. Whether It's just "I'm being lucky" or radio from a specific song, band or album they very rarely disappoint me these days. I just make sure to thumbs up if it plays a song I particularly love. I am a student and could go cheaper with spotify but the AI generated playlists have me locked in. If it's £5 cheaper but I'm not gonna enjoy it nearly as much then it's not really a good deal. AndTheWorldMayNeverKnow I used the 3 or 4 months free trial during the holidays then bought the family plan for $14.99 a month. 4 people in my family us it and it works great, the app could use some tweaks but it's really good overall. paev If you listen to main stream music it doesn't really matter what service to use. However, if you like something unusual, weird or other languages then Google is a way to go. I found bands on Google music that Spotify displayed as not found. Google also have new synth bands that Spotify doesn't. I'm for Google too. Daniel I discovered that GPM is kinda like a music label. I once went to a section of Google play explaining how indie artists can use GPM like a music label as long as they own all their rights. Ryne Hager Ultraista (among others) keeps me using Google Play Music as well as Spotify. Carson Saldanha Does anyone else who activated the Play Music trial have YouTube Red working as well? My YT Red doesn't seem to be enabled while my Play Music is. Michael Carr I spotted a similar offer a couple of months ago, and I took it after a day or two's thought. Just last week, I moved directly into a family plan. PewPewYoureDead It's hard to recommend Google Play Music until they revamp the UI. Margaritas Ante Porcos Google Music is the only choice in some markets, like Russia, where no Spotify or Pandora are available. There are too many shortcomings in Google Music and Google never shows interest in making services better than below average. I really wonder why Google refuses to become the best at anything. Real magic here. Pixel syndrome all the way. Yet Google Music is on my phone and I use it because there's no choice whatsoever. Rob You answered your own question. If there's no alternative, then they don't have any incentive to improve the service. SupahNin10doh Stupid Dorito logo... Raymond Berger Huh, I just subscribed to the trial but you youtube red hasn't kicked in yet. Any idea how long it takes? Iamsecond If you live in the UK, about 2 years so far h20ray Google Play Music is currently available in select territories and for select account types. Umang Ladia I'm only seeing 2 months offer in India, anybody can confirm? Mohammad Ovais Yeah, same for me. Maybe it's region limited. Isolde I think you need to open the link in a browser, if you open it in the app it's just the normal 2 months. Manoj | Blogging Triggers Is Google Music really worth to it? We have better alternatives Sathiya Moorthy Karan I came across a great post, it seems to be so cool http://developeit.net/android-news-image-scanner-finder/ Zachariah Mann It only shows up as 2 free months for me. I live in Michigan. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/a19b7e9dddb67bf897c751aedf63c01917048214140db901fd783b2182d8d5c0.png Mikael Jakobsson Should mabye joine premium at Google Music if that coste like $2 max a month dont understand why they should take as mutch as someone some has app or Win32 software to PC so music controllers one they keyboards works. Tab out frome a game for pause music when the round is over is just bad. Arif Gürü And stil isnt available on Turkey xyz "No telling how long this offer might last, so if you have been considering subscribing, now might be the time to do it." No thanks, I'll just use YouTube. Only thing YT needs is an option to play audio only so I can save a wee bit more data when I don't need video.

It started with Siri, the digital assistant baked into iOS, that was waiting for me the moment I fired up my iPhone SE for the first time. But now Google is moving in on Apple's turf by releasing an iOS version of Google Assistant, its own take on a helper powered by artificial intelligence. Illustration: Tom's GuideAnd Google Assistant isn't even first app angling to replace Siri as my go-to iPhone helper. Cortana, Microsoft's digital assistant, has been available for iOS devices for more than a year. Downton Abbey doesn't have this much help scurrying about. But which assistant should you turn to for help with everything from sending texts to getting answers for your burning questions? The correct choice seems obvious enough that you wouldn't even need a voice-powered assistant to help you figure it out. Siri is integrated into iOS, so you would think it has the edge over any Johnny-come-lately assistant vying for a space on your iPhone. MORE: 33 Hidden iOS 10 Features You Need to Try And you'd be right for the most part. Siri is extremely convenient, as it's just a Home button press or a "Hey Siri" command away. But Google Assistant for iOS has a few tricks up its virtual sleeve to make the competition closer than you would assume. Here's how Siri, Google Assistant and Cortana measure up as your go-to assistant on the iPhone. Ease of Use Let's start out with the category where it's no contest. Siri is, by far, the easiest to use since Apple integrates it into iOS, and you can summon the assistant from anywhere. Just make a long press on the Home button or say "Hey Siri" — provided you've enabled that feature in Settings — and Apple's built-in assistant springs to life. With Google Assistant and Cortana, you've got to launch those apps before you can ask either one for help. That's an extra step that seemingly negates the convenience of having an assistant on hand. Google Assistant at least throws in a few handy features to make using the app on an iPhone worth your while. When it answers your questions, Google Assistant will also offer up tappable actions that can dive deeper into what you want. (A question about an upcoming Oakland A's game might yield panels that can call up MLB news or the standings.) You can switch to a keyboard for those times you don't want to bark out a request to Google Assistant in public. And Google Assistant ties in rather nicely with other Google apps like Photos and Gmail if you have those on your iPhone. Cortana tries to take on more of a day planner role, with a panel of recommended articles pulled from Bing, the current weather conditions, and an email assistant that alerts you to urgent messages (if you tie-in an email account, that is). Another panel can also show you what traffic's like on your morning commute. As handy as it is to have this information in one place, it seemingly mirrors the Today screen on iOS 10, which I can reach simply by swiping right from my Home screen. Winner: Siri. It's hard to beat an assistant that's immediately accessible when it comes to ease of use. Making Phone Calls Having to dig through your contacts to dial a phone number is drudgery. Better to have an assistant do the grunt work for you, and Siri is tops at this, thanks to its direct line into iOS 10. Tell Siri to call a contact, and the call gets placed immediately. (One complaint: If that contact has both a work and home number, Siri won't always stop to ask you which.) Both Cortana and Google Assistant will dig up phone numbers from your contacts, but you've got to hit the call button yourself to make the call. All three assistants are equally adept at looking up phone numbers such as the number of that nearby pizza place that offers takeout. Only Siri lets you then call with a voice command, though I like the fact that Google Assistant summons up additional information like directions to the place you've just looked up. Winner: Siri. Again, the iOS tie-in gives Apple's assistant the edge. Sending Messages Whether it's sending an email or text, Siri's dominance continues. I could dictate a text message to my wife without ever having to touch — or even unlock — my iPhone. Things get complicated if Siri mishears you and you need to edit the message, but at least Apple's assistant asks you if you're ready to send the text or email before it fires off an error-ridden missive. Google Assistant will happily take dictation on a text message, but you have to tap a button on the screen to send it. It will do the same for mail, provided you've got the Gmail app on your iPhone. I don't — instead I've tied my Gmail account into the built-in Mail app on iOS, but Google Assistant wouldn't take a message there, instead prompting me to download Gmail. Cortana's even less adept with messaging. Ask it to send a text or email, and it will pull up a blank message with the contact filled in, but you've got to do the actual typing. At least, Cortana doesn't require a specific mail client. When I told it to send an email to my wife, it pulled up a message with her contact info filled in — and from my Gmail account no less. (That is when Cortana was able to understand me: three times out of five, it misheard my wife's last name and left the contact info blank.) Winner: Siri. There's no better choice when it comes to hands-free communication. Looking Up Answers At some point during the day, you're going to come up with a burning question you're just dying to answer, but you don't want to endure the vagaries of a web search to find what you're looking for. So which of the assistants available on your iPhone does the best job at tracking down those answers? I asked four questions of each assistant: How many cups are in a pint? What's the longest river in Europe? What day is Christmas on this year? What's the weather like this weekend? Google Assistant was the only one to successfully answer all four questions, though it stumbled a bit when it came to Christmas. (When I phrased the question as "What day is Christmas this year?" Google Assistant told me the date for 2016; only when I rephrased it to "on this year" did Google Assistant produce the right answer. Siri got three of the four questions right, and even threw in a touch of personality on the Christmas question. ("I hope you get the day off," Siri added.) But asking Siri to name the longest river in Europe produced the dreaded "I found something on the web" response where Siri lists a series of search results. Cortana could tell me that the Volga River is the longest in Europe, but was flummoxed about Christmas, asking to see my calendar. Even when I granted permission, it couldn't find anything. Maybe Cortana's just not the celebratory type. Winner: Google Assistant. Google's knowledge graph means fewer virtual shrugs from its digital assistant. Asking Follow-Up Questions Sometimes you don't always get all the information you need with your first question. So how well do Siri, Google Assistant and Cortana deal with follow ups? I asked all three iOS assistants to tell me the score of the Giants game, and all three complied. Then I asked "Who are they playing next?" Siri and Google Assistant dutifully listed the next Giants game on the schedule; Cortana brought up a page of web results, most of which featured upcoming soccer matches. All three assistants also were able to rattle off the stars of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 when I asked. Only Google Assistant, though, successfully listed nearby theaters when I followed up with "Where is it playing?" Siri didn't understand the question; Cortana gave me another list of search results, led off by the definition for "playing." Winner: Google Assistant seems more adept at picking up on the context of your questions, even vaguely worded ones, than the other two assistants. Playing Music We're back in Siri's wheelhouse, at least when it comes to controlling music playback. You can use Siri to play songs, pause them or fast-forward to the next tune, all without ever opening the Music app. Siri can sometimes stumble on song titles — when I asked it to play "Desperado," it thought I wanted to download the 1995 Robert Rodriguez movie as opposed to listening to the Eagles standard. But for the most part, Siri's a great way to access whatever tracks you have stashed in your library. Asking for a song or album in Google Assistant would bring up links to either the Music app or YouTube. Tapping the Music App link would take me to Music, but nothing would play unless I searched for that track in the app. Why even bother with an assistant at that point? As for Cortana, it would either find videos — usually of someone showing you how to play that song on a guitar or keyboard — or links to purchasing that song on Grove or Amazon. Winner: Siri. The other two assistants have no ear for music. Getting Directions Your preference here is likely going to come down to which Maps app you prefer. Ask Siri for directions to a locale, and you'll be given turn-by-turn directions in iOS's Maps. (Funnily enough, asking Cortana for directions takes you to Maps, too.) Google Assistant, on the other hand, will send you to Google Maps, assuming you have that app installed on your phone. Google Assistant seems to do a better job at understanding the names and places of where you want to go. I asked Siri for directions to my daughter's elementary school, which is named after the artist Maya Lin; Siri thought I wanted to go to Myland Park Elementary School, plotting out the 2600-mile journey from my house to Morgantown, West Virginia. Using Google Assistant, I could also summon up alternative directions in Google Maps, like taking a different bridge to reach the San Francisco Airport instead of the Siri-mandated Bay Bridge route. MORE: iOS 10 Maps vs. Google Maps: Which Guides The Best? Winner: Google Assistant recognized my speech more accurately, and the Google Maps tie-in negates Siri's home-field advantage on the iPhone. Making Reservations Ask Siri to book you a table at your favorite and more often than not, you'll get an apologetic message that it can book a table right now. To Siri's credit, it will offer to help you call the restaurant to book the reservation yourself. To Siri's detriment, it has a hard time making sense of difficult restaurant names like the nearby German eatery Speisekammer (which Siri hears as "Spice a Comma). Cortana is even more inept at making dinner reservations, flat out refusing to book a table. If it understands the name of the restaurant, it will bring up an information page where you can place a call to reserve your own table. This is where Google Assistant really shines. I asked to book a table at Café Jolie, and it not only understood my horrible French accent, but walked me through the process of making a reservation using Open Table by asking me how many people were in the party and what time we wanted to eat. Winner: Google Assistant. This isn't even close. Reminders & Events Good news if you want your digital assistant to remind you of tasks, deadlines and to-dos. Siri, Google Assistant and Cortana are all equally up to the task. I told each one to remind me to turn in this story at 10 a.m. And at the appointed hour, reminders from all three assistants popped up on my iPhone's lock screen. (That I didn't file the story on time is something I'd like to blame on them but can't.) All three also do comparable jobs at setting up events on your calendar, though Siri was clever enough to know when I created an event for the first Saturday in June that I meant June 3. (This lack of a specific date flummoxed Cortana.) Google Assistant handled my calendar appointments, too, making them in Google Calendar rather than in the built in Calendar app, so your preference here is likely to come down to which calendar app you prefer. Winner: Siri, but only by the slightest of margins over Google Assistant. Other Actions Last fall's iOS 10 release opened up Siri to more third party apps, and Apple's assistant is the better for it. I can — and have — used Siri to book a ride on Lyft, and I could also ask it to send money to friends through an app like Venmo, start a chat on Skype or start a workout on Runtastic. Apple needs to broaden Siri integration to even more apps, but I suspect we'll hear more about that as soon as June's Worldwide Developer Conference. Google is promising more capabilities for Google Assistant, too, and the biggest coming feature is Google Lens integration. That will allow you to use image recognition capabilities to have the assistant summon up various commands, like buying tickets to a concert when you capture a picture of a concert poster. But that feature hasn't come to Google Assistant just yet. Winner: Siri, though it will be interesting to see how Google Lens-powered feature might change this assessment. Bottom Line As noted when we started, being built and maintained by Apple has its advantages when it comes to digital assistants. You can access Siri at any time on your iPhone as opposed to being forced to launch a specific app, and that's an edge that's difficult for either third-party assistant to overcome. Yet, Google Assistant is nearly up to the task, thanks in large part to its ability to both recognize what you're saying and to put that information in context. I particularly like the way Google Assistant can walk you through tasks like making a dinner reservation or creating a calendar event without throwing up its virtual hands and leaving you all on your own. Siri may be the best choice to act as your iPhone's virtual helper for most tasks, but Google Assistant outshines it in some areas. And hopefully, the arrival of Google Assistant on iOS will push Apple to make some improvements of its own.

An anonymous reader quotes a report from The Guardian: Google argued that it was too financially burdensome and logistically challenging to compile and hand over salary records that the government has requested, sparking a strong rebuke from the U.S. Department of Labor (DoL), which has accused the Silicon Valley firm of underpaying women. Google officials testified in federal court on Friday that it would have to spend up to 500 hours of work and $100,000 to comply with investigators' ongoing demands for wage data that the DoL believes will help explain why the technology corporation appears to be systematically discriminating against women. Noting Google's nearly $28 billion annual income as one of the most profitable companies in the U.S., DoL attorney Ian Eliasoph scoffed at the company's defense, saying, "Google would be able to absorb the cost as easy as a dry kitchen sponge could absorb a single drop of water." business money usa ← You may like to read: → A New Amiga Arrives On the Scene -- the A-EON Amiga X5000 Silicon Valley Investors Call For California To Secede From the US After Trump Win Twitters Says It Will Ban Trump If He Breaks Hate-Speech Rules Ask Slashdot: Would You Recommend Updating To Windows 10?

It is also reasonable that Google knows this, or it wouldn't be baulking at providing the data (and exploiting the P.R. benefits of showing "there! we do pay people fairly"). The question is whether Google would consider the odds of getting found out and having to pay people more, AND paying a fine for obstructing some dam' law or other, is worth the effort they are going to, to behave in such a manner.

As with all complex issues, there are two sides. Yes, Google has to provide a certain amount of information to the government, as part of its government contracts. however, they have already provided quite a lot of information. The DoL is now looking for historical information, and wants to interview a wide range of employees throughout the company. This is beyond the usual level of stuff that government contractors have to provide. The DoL claims that this is because they find discrepancies in male/female pay at Google. Now, I have zero knowledge of Google's internal pay practices, but on the face of it, this is extraordinarily unlikely. First of all, the IT industry wage-gap has already been thoroughly debunked: a gap only exists if you deliberately ignore things like years taken off for childcare, which result in less experience and missed promotion opportunities. Second, Google is big enough, and under enough observation, that their HR department will be extraordinarily careful about issues like this. All of which leads me to suspect that there's a hidden motive here. Maybe someone in the DoL is trying to make a name for themselves? Maybe there's a private lawsuit waiting in the wings, hoping for a big settlement? Maybe someone is just hoping to be bought off, possibly via a revolving door?

Spurious correlation with incentive-based pay (Score:3) by shanen ( 462549 ) writes: on Saturday May 27, 2017 @07:24PM (#54499383) Homepage Journal If you study the google a bit, it seems obvious to me (after reading many of those books) that the extreme incentive policies could easily create the appearance of gender discrimination that reflect actual compensation results. To summarize briefly, if a particular googler is involved in an extremely successful project, then that googler will get obscenely more money than others, even though they are doing the same kind of work. I don't think this favors men because they are inherently more skilled, harder workers, or even luckier. The two most likely causes are related to gender, however: Willingness to take extreme risks and prioritization of work over life. On that basis, I think has two primary secrets they are trying to conceal here: (1) How they protect losers from failure because they want to encourage risky behaviors. (And even with that insurance, I think women are more risk averse on average.) (2) That work-life balance at the google is really a lie and the company is dominated in every way (including in compensation) by workaholics. The strong incentive pay just makes it look worse and might make the google look more EVIL than it is. If that is possible. Makes me sad how the unbounded love of money turned the good google into such a monster. The motto of today's google: "All your attention are belong to us." The ultimate threat is when people realize that all of the world's information has been prioritized to the BS info the advertisers are paying the google to shove down our throats by abusing our privacy and by raping our personal information. All in a futile quest to solve an unsolvable problem. There is no biggest number and there is no profit that is big enough to "solve" super-greed. As usual, today's Slashdot has been disappointing, though at least it isn't evil as we measure the google. In particular I lament the lack of funny comments. However I just got the weird idea for units of EVIL measured in googlevils? Should be shorter, but something along those lines.

Liking numbers isn't enough. People using information theory in business these days, people who read Stiglitz, understand that information as a cost. That is why wages stagnate instead of dropping during a bad recession; it would cost money to find out what the new balance of worker supply/demand is. If you go too far you would lose workers; by the time you get that feedback, you've already received the harm. There is no free warning system. Same problem here; wages and worker supply is constantly changing, you'd have to do expensive studies on a continuous basis to ever have this information. No employer does that, and none would. It is just asking too much. Like the summary points out, the actual pay at issue is a tiny amount of money and there is no reason for google to avoid paying it. Which is true; they would certainly prefer to have wage fairness! But they also need to be using a pay system based on perceived merit, so that they have healthy feedback loops. It might actually be better to have government track worker pay across the economy, and provide the wage information that they want businesses to consider in their hiring practices. Each worker is different and has different value, so you need a detailed system to account for what you value in a worker if you're really going to make decisions that would have improved outcomes. It isn't enough to pay based on an underwear check, because the Shapiro-Stiglitz efficiency wage model requires employers to target wages to minimize shirking. In a factory that is easier, but in professional work it requires individualized pay packages. Even if not personalized, you'd need a large number of pay levels that people can be placed at, and so it is effectively the same and will also have the same marginal problems with bias and fairness.

By: Bloomberg | Published: May 27, 2017 6:23 PM Apple Inc. got an early start in artificial intelligence software with the 2011 introduction of Siri, a tool that lets users operate their smartphones with voice commands. (Reuters) Apple Inc. got an early start in artificial intelligence software with the 2011 introduction of Siri, a tool that lets users operate their smartphones with voice commands. Now the electronics giant is bringing artificial intelligence to chips. Apple is working on a processor devoted specifically to AI-related tasks, according to a person familiar with the matter. The chip, known internally as the Apple Neural Engine, would improve the way the company’s devices handle tasks that would otherwise require human intelligence — such as facial recognition and speech recognition, said the person, who requested anonymity discussing a product that hasn’t been made public. Apple declined to comment. Engineers at Apple are racing to catch their peers at Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc. in the booming field of artificial intelligence. While Siri gave Apple an early advantage in voice-recognition, competitors have since been more aggressive in deploying AI across their product lines, including Amazon’s Echo and Google’s Home digital assistants. An AI-enabled processor would help Cupertino, California-based Apple integrate more advanced capabilities into devices, particularly cars that drive themselves and gadgets that run augmented reality, the technology that superimposes graphics and other information onto a person’s view of the world. “Two of the areas that Apple is betting its future on require AI,” said Gene Munster, former Apple analyst and co-founder of venture capital firm Loup Ventures. “At the core of augmented reality and self-driving cars is artificial intelligence.” Improved Performance Apple devices currently handle complex artificial intelligence processes with two different chips: the main processor and the graphics chip. The new chip would let Apple offload those tasks onto a dedicated module designed specifically for demanding artificial intelligence processing, allowing Apple to improve battery performance. Should Apple bring the chip out of testing and development, it would follow other semiconductor makers that have already introduced dedicated AI chips. Qualcomm Inc.’s latest Snapdragon chip for smartphones has a module for handling artificial intelligence tasks, while Google announced its first chip, called the Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), in 2016. That chip worked in Google’s data centers to power search results and image-recognition. At its I/O conference this year, Google announced a new version that will be available to clients of its cloud business. Nvidia Corp. also sells a similar chip to cloud customers. You May Also Like To Watch This: The Apple AI chip is designed to make significant improvements to Apple’s hardware over time, and the company plans to eventually integrate the chip into many of its devices, including the iPhone and iPad, according to the person with knowledge of the matter. Apple has tested prototypes of future iPhones with the chip, the person said, adding that it’s unclear if the component will be ready this year. Apple’s operating systems and software features would integrate with devices that include the chip. For example, Apple has considered offloading facial recognition in the photos application, some parts of speech recognition, and the iPhone’s predictive keyboard to the chip, the person said. Apple also plans to offer developer access to the chip so third-party apps can also offload artificial intelligence-related tasks, the person said. Developer Conference Apple may choose to discuss some of its latest advancements in AI at its annual developer’s conference in June. At the same conference, Apple plans to introduce iOS 11, its new operating system for iPhones and iPads, with an updated user-interface, people with knowledge of the matter said last month. The company is also said to discuss updated laptops with faster chips from Intel Corp. An AI chip would join a growing list of processors that Apple has created in-house. The company began designing its own main processors for the iPhone and iPad in 2010 with the A4 chip. It has since released dedicated processors to power the Apple Watch, the motion sensors across its products, the wireless components inside of its AirPods, and the fingerprint scanner in the MacBook Pro. The company has also tested a chip to run the low-power mode on Mac laptops. In 2015, Bloomberg reported that Apple’s culture of secrecy stymied the iPhone maker’s ability to attract top AI research talent. Since then, Apple has acquired multiple companies with deep ties to artificial intelligence, has begun publishing papers related to AI research, has joined a key research group and has made hires from the field. In October 2016, Apple hired Russ Salakhutdinov from Carnegie Mellon University as its director of AI research. No Comments.

Google Maps v9.54 prepares to add saved locations for your school and gym, notification channels, and what looks like a task list [APK Teardown] Cody Toombs Follow View All Posts 2017/05/26 6:22am PDTMay 26, 2017 38 Plus 1 on G+ 65 Share on Facebook 51 Share on Twitter Total Shares103 APK Teardown Applications Downloads What's Really New Article Contents 1 Teardown 1.1 Saved locations for School and Gym 1.2 The 'Other' Notification Channel 1.3 A few new prompts 1.4 A task list called "Nearby Need?" 2 Download An update to Google Maps v9.54 began rolling out to users through the beta channel yesterday, but it doesn't appear to have any visible changes going live quite yet. However, a teardown of the apk does bring a few hints about what to expect in the future. There are clues about a couple of new saved destinations like the Home and Work slots that have become so useful, the first stirring of support for Android O's notification channels, a few new "promos" to get people interested in various features, and a very curious feature that might turn out to be a task list of sorts. As usual, we've got a link at the bottom to download this update to sideload if you're not interested in waiting for Google to deliver it to your device. Teardown Disclaimer: Teardowns are based on evidence found inside of apks (Android's application package) and are necessarily speculative and usually based on incomplete information. It's possible that the guesses made here are totally and completely wrong. Even when predictions are correct, there is always a chance that plans could change or may be canceled entirely. Much like rumors, nothing is certain until it's officially announced and released. The features discussed below are probably not live yet, or may only be live for a small percentage of users. Unless stated otherwise, don't expect to see these features if you install the apk. Saved locations for School and Gym If you find yourself regularly using the Home and Work saved locations for quick navigation, you'll enjoy this one. The Maps team is expanding the list to include two more common destinations: your gym and your school. <string name="GYM_LOCATION">Gym</string> <string name="SCHOOL_LOCATION">School</string> Since those two strings don't really include any specific telltale signs that they're intended to be default saved locations, I've included the two previously existing lines for Home and Work for comparison. It's pretty obvious that the naming convention matches up. <string name="HOME_LOCATION">Home</string> <string name="WORK_LOCATION">Work</string> There is also a newly added icon for education, which I would naturally assume will go with the School destination. There doesn't appear to be a similar icon dedicated to the Gym slot, but it's not as if Google can't easily color-fill the existing fitness icon. Nevertheless, this one missing icon might be a hint that Google won't make these new destination slots available until a future update includes the missing icon. These two new entries will obviously operate just like Home and Work for the purposes of navigation and quick route selection. And as always, users don't have to actually link these slots to real schools or gyms. I'm sure a lot of people will welcome this simple improvement because so many of us travel to more than just work and home in a typical day. The 'Other' Notification Channel I'll just make a quick mention of this topic since it's not really that interesting. Google Maps is going to have a notification channel on Android O titled "Other notifications." <string name="OTHER_NOTIFICATION_CHANNEL">Other notifications</string> I doubt this will be the only custom channel for Maps. After all, there are several subsections in Settings dedicated to each notification type, so we'll probably see the channel list grow a fair amount in the future. I would assume the Maps team is still trying to decide how to best organize the app's notifications. This "other" channel will probably become a placeholder for most of the notifications until they are organized into suitable channels. A few new prompts I normally skip changes that are meant to advertise existing features, but sometimes the focus of banners and notifications can give a little insight into the features and apps that may not be performing as well as expected or simply need user awareness. The latest Maps update includes three new promos. The first banner is for the Google Trips app. Launched around this time last year, Trips is basically an itinerary management app that's also intended for making local recommendations. Trips probably doesn't have a very substantial user base yet, so it's not hard to imagine why Google is trying to breathe a little more life into it. code <string name="OFFLINE_MAPS_TRIPS_APP_BANNER_TITLE">Take your travel info with you</string> <string name="OFFLINE_MAPS_TRIPS_APP_BANNER_TITLE_WITH_AREA_NAME">Take your %1$s travel info with you</string> <string name="OFFLINE_MAPS_TRIPS_APP_BANNER_BODY">Reservations • Things to do • Day plans</string> <string name="OFFLINE_MAPS_TRIPS_APP_BANNER_DOWNLOAD_LINK">Get Google Trips app</string> <string name="OFFLINE_MAPS_TRIPS_APP_BANNER_DISMISS_LINK">No thanks</string> The next addition is intended to get users to try out the recently launched location sharing feature. It's pretty normal to show prompts to get users only newly released features, so there's nothing unusual about this one, but you can probably expect to see it in your navigation setup soon. code <string name="CAR_TI TLE_JOURNEY_SHARING">Share journey</string> <string name="JOURNEY_SHARING_PENDING_PROMPT_TEXT">Share your trip with %1$s</string> <string name="JOURNEY_SHARING_PENDING_PROMPT_TTS">Sharing your real-time location with %1$s until you arrive.</string> <string name="CAR_MENU_START_JOURNEY_SHARING">Share journey</string> <string name="CAR_MENU_STOP_JOURNEY_SHARING">Stop sharing</string> The final promotional banner will belong to the always familiar Local Guides program. As usual, it's going to encourage users to contribute to Maps for points. The one interesting oddity is that these strings have "v2" in their names. It's possible this just means they are for a new set of promos, or this might hint at a revised version of the points program. I would expect the former, but it's at least worth acknowledging the latter is possible. code <string name="POINTS_V2_PROMO_TITLE">Reach new Local Guides levels</string> <string name="POINTS_V2_PROMO_TEXT">Now earn more points for your reviews, photos, edits, and adding new places.</string> <string name="POINTS_V2_PROMO_GOTO_STATS">SEE YOUR LEVEL</string> <string name="POINTS_V2_PROMO_OPEN_HELP">Learn more</string> A task list called "Nearby Need?" There's very little to go on for this topic, but it looks just weird enough that I suspect there's a feature brewing in there somewhere. A pair of new layouts were added with the name "nearby need," one of which defines the look of a list, and the other is for items in that list. There is also a single string with a related name and just the word "navigate" for text. <string name="NEARBY_NEED_NAVIGATE">Navigate</string> /layout/nearby_need_item.xml /layout/nearby_need.xml Based on this very limited amount of information, it does sound a little like a shopping list of sorts. Perhaps less like a grocery list and more like a list of chores or tasks – e.g. getting new tires on the car, picking up some materials for a weekend project, and buying new clothes. I would assume each item goes into a list and Google Maps will make it easy to navigate to the next nearest place where each of these things can be taken care of. I'm not actually sure if these are related, but there are also three new images to be found in the resources, and they certainly would fit with my theory. The first is for creating new tasks, the second is for completed tasks, and the final one is for "old" completed tasks. I suppose the old one might be for things a user did on previous days but hasn't removed from the list. This is all guesswork right now, but many people have been asking for ways to use Maps to get through chores, and this feels like the first hint of something like that. The one aspect that's not yet hinted at, but I certainly hope to see, is a feature that will sort tasks efficiently so people can choose the shortest (or fastest) route to get everything done. I'll keep watching and follow up when there are more developments.

They are used when you go to Your Contributions -> Check the Facts/Uncover Missing info. I think after all this time those two are still only for lvl 5 local guides... so yeah. Cody Toombs Right, the look of the images aren't new, but the files containing those images are. Or said more clearly, there are now multiple copies of those icons. mmark27 I sure would like there to be a "Work" and then a "Parking for Work" section for those that don't park right next to their office. Point being, if I want walking direction/estimations, give them from my office. If I want driving directions/estimations on time, know that I have to walk to my car, then drive from my parking location. The School addition will be good to finally have pop up automatically now though. Cody Toombs If you're not going to use all four slots for their intended purpose, you might just assign one of the others to be your work parking. Frankly, I would have liked these saved slots to have custom labels, since some people don't fit into this one shape. For example, I know somebody that has to travel to two different sites for the same job, and another friend that was enrolled in two different schools at the same time. It's not like one of these destinations can't go into the "Gym" slot, but it would be nice if the titles could make sense. mmark27 Right. I now have my "Work" location saved as my parking lot, which is silly, but it's the only way to get decent estimations. Your fix is what I'll be doing otherwise unless they fix it. The subtly though in this situation is El Goog knowing that the Work and Work Parking are linked existentially, so they can decipher where my body is and estimate from there, etc. Same can be said for Home and Home Parking if not directly on site. Would seem like Google's apartment-city-dwelling-first mentality would be more amenable to this off the bat. I agree that we should be able to have free labels on places and also as many places as we can stomach estimations/notifications on time to. Google knows where I am at all times....make it actually useful, guys. henleyb I work from home and Google would keep asking me to set my work address which is of course the same as my home address, it was a small but annoying thing. :) Austin Spangrud Sure would be nice if maps got integrated assistant into it. None of the commands and home commands that I have integrate with the Voice button in maps. Oh and In b4 where's my speed limit pop up Cody Toombs Speed limits are still limited geographically. Since I was in the Bay Area last week, I finally saw them pop up for the first time on my phone and in Android Auto. Funny enough, I now have a Speed Limit toggle in settings on one phone, but nowhere else :/ And now I'm probably not going to see the speed limits again for a long time. Paul_Werner Yeah and we used to have them and they disappeared. At least it did for me here in the Milwaukee, WI area. Same for when I travel to Chicago Nicholas Matranga Finally, it was so annoying to have to save my school address as my work address just to get commute updates. mike shwilly Grow up Hamilton Jimenez Vasquez Finally, Im glad that we can save more pinned-saved choices other than the usual Home and Work, although I would prefer to customize them on my own in the same manner we customize the saved list. I could make a really good use of few in my mind like Church, Work2, University, etc. Jon Xuereb Couldn't you use this school one for University Hamilton Jimenez Vasquez I used the word University just an example, the point is that it would be great to customize those pinned saves using our own creations. Taylor Hardy I work from comfort and ease of my property or home, through doing easy gigs that only takes from you a Computer and web connection and I am also joyful than before... After six months time in this project and also i got made in sum 36,000 usd... Basically I make near 80 bucks/hr and work for three to four hours every day.And excellent point relating to this work is that you can easily handle time and effort while you work and for how long as you prefer and you generate a paycheck per week........ learn by clicking here how to do it right now Paul_Werner I can't wait to see that "nearby need" implemented. Your guesswork on it sounds like it could be a really useful feature. h4rr4r Why are these static names? Why can't I add random strings and assign them saved locations? Ken Vincent what ever happened to speed limits? I thought that was on the verge of being a thing more then a year ago. UKTK8 "In the coming weeks" Meaning whenever Google d#$% well pleases. Jon Xuereb Lawyers I'm assuming dmo580 Yet Waze and other GPS apps have no issues. How about just displaying my current speed? Ken Vincent Not only that, but google provides speed limits as a service. I would imagine that is where Waze gets their speed limit info. https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/roads/speed-limits Jon Xuereb Because Google Maps is exponentially larger in terms of user base, and google is a bigger target for lawsuits Ken Vincent Waze is wholly owned by Google. They are not even an Alphabet company, they are Google. Jon Xuereb Still the size of the userbase affects the their risk assessment icyhotmike why not just let us add "Saved" locations such as Home and Work and whatever else we want? Damn Google in control of everything. makapav My God the Google apps and ecosystem are becoming such a clusterfuck with no sources of truth for data points. All the information is spread across random places. Richard Oldroyd I do use home a lot but for the others like gym I save as a contact and nav just as quick. Richard Oldroyd I'd love maps to display my current speed and advise what the speed limit is. Obviously they would have to add a warning saying they can not be held responsible for displaying an incorrect speed limit. I'd also like to see us be able to choose what is displayed underneath where they show destination time and miles to go, it would be useful to see arrival times at all stops not just the one you are currently naving to.

Google Phone v10 enables post-call messages for failed calls, prepares for enhanced incoming calls on RCS and voicemail backup [APK Teardown + Download] Cody Toombs Follow View All Posts 2017/05/23 1:19pm PDTMay 23, 2017 59 Plus 1 on G+ 111 Share on Facebook 54 Share on Twitter Total Shares224 APK Teardown Applications Downloads News Article Contents 1 What's New 1.1 Post-call messages 2 Teardown 2.1 RCS Calling 2.2 Voicemail Backup 3 Download With the dust settling after the deluge caused by I/O 2017, it's time to take a closer look at some of the many other things that came with out last week. Some interesting changes came with a brand new version of the Google Phone app included with Android O Developer Preview 2. There's a new prompt suggesting users send a message after a call fails to connect. A deep dive into the apk also turned up signs that Google is working on new RCS calling features and preparing some kind of backup option for voicemail. What's New Unofficial Changelog: (the stuff we found) Post-call messaging Post-call messages Earlier this month, a teardown of of v9 provided a good hint that the Phone app would begin showing suggestions for messages to send after completing a call. With v10, that feature is now live, but not quite as functional as previously expected. Left: snackbar prompt. Right: new message screen. The post-call messaging feature appears as a snackbar prompt asking why you called, to which you can send a message. The prompt only appears after attempting a call that fails without making a connection. To be specific, the prompt won't show up if you hang up, a voicemail service answers, or anything else occurs that would be considered a connection. Basically, if you hear a sound indicating the other end is ringing, any outcome from that point on is probably not going to trigger the prompt. You're most likely to see this prompt in an area where cellular reception isn't good enough to establish a voice call, but you can also force it to show up by trying to make a call while airplane mode is active. Otherwise, it's probably not going to turn up anywhere else. If you opt to send a message, you'll be taken to a screen with a message box and three pre-written messages with different levels of urgency. Tapping a message will put it into the textbox below, but you can continue to make edits before sending. The exact text of the prompt seems to be a mismatch for the current functionality, which left us wondering if this feature is also intended to work in other scenarios like when the call is redirected to voicemail or disconnects within a second of being picked up. Perhaps this is just the first step and other use cases will be handled in the future. In the meantime, this actually might be handy if you're in the middle of nowhere and staring at a single signal bar with no hope of making a call. Teardown Disclaimer: Teardowns are based on evidence found inside of apks (Android's application package) and are necessarily speculative and usually based on incomplete information. It's possible that the guesses made here are totally and completely wrong. Even when predictions are correct, there is always a chance that plans could change or may be canceled entirely. Much like rumors, nothing is certain until it's officially announced and released. The features discussed below are probably not live yet, or may only be live for a small percentage of users. Unless stated otherwise, don't expect to see these features if you install the apk. RCS Calling It's no secret that Google is working to add fairly extensive RCS support to both its Phone app and Android Messages. Now it's just a matter of which features are going to be added and when we'll get to use some them. This update to the Phone app gives us a bit more insight into some new rich calling features that we'll soon have at our disposal. A stack of new notification strings reveal that Google's developers are currently working on supporting incoming calls with additional data. At this time, it's clear calls can include a location, photo, message, or any combination of those. One line also mentions "attachments," which may suggest other types of data are supported, but not necessarily known in advance. This would make sense for things like URLs or specially crafted data packets can be handed off between other apps. It's also worth noting that these strings are split up for regular and "important" calls, which lines up with the commonly known feature allowing callers to indicate a degree of urgency. code <string name="important_notification_incoming_call_attachments">Important incoming call with attachments</string> <string name="important_notification_incoming_call_with_location">Important incoming call with location</string> <string name="important_notification_incoming_call_with_message">Important incoming call with message</string> <string name="important_notification_incoming_call_with_message_location">Important incoming call with message and location</string> <string name="important_notification_incoming_call_with_photo">Important incoming call with photo</string> <string name="important_notification_incoming_call_with_photo_location">Important incoming call with photo and location</string> <string name="important_notification_incoming_call_with_photo_message">Important incoming call with photo and message</string> <string name="important_notification_incoming_call_with_photo_message_location">Important incoming call with photo, message and location</string> <string name="notification_incoming_call_attachments">Incoming call with attachments</string> <string name="notification_incoming_call_with_location">Incoming call with location</string> <string name="notification_incoming_call_with_message">Incoming call with message</string> <string name="notification_incoming_call_with_message_location">Incoming call with message and location</string> <string name="notification_incoming_call_with_photo">Incoming call with photo</string> <string name="notification_incoming_call_with_photo_location">Incoming call with photo and location</string> <string name="notification_incoming_call_with_photo_message">Incoming call with photo and message</string> <string name="notification_incoming_call_with_photo_message_location">Incoming call with photo, message and location</string> It's not yet clear if attachments will be shown on the screen with incoming calls, but I think it's a pretty safe bet that they will be. After all, knowing there's a photo with the call isn't nearly as compelling as actually seeing it. This was part of the pitch for the Knock Knock feature when Google introduced the Duo app at last year's I/O keynote. The same certainly can be said about locations and messages, as well. So far, there doesn't appear to be an interface for callers to actually attach this type of data, so it's safe to say development is still ongoing. Seeing as most carriers are still stuck on very rudimentary implementations of RCS and intra-network compatibility is moving at a sloth-like pace, I'm sure Google will have this done long before any of us would get to use it. Voicemail Backup Are you the type of person that never deletes voicemails? This one might be for you. It seems that Google will begin asking users if they want to turn on "extra storage" when their voicemail inbox fills its capacity. This allows Google to "manage and backup your voicemail messages" to free up some space. code <string name="voicemail_error_inbox_almost_full_turn_archive_on_title">Turn on extra storage and backup</string> <string name="voicemail_error_inbox_almost_full_turn_archive_on_message">Your mailbox is almost full. To free up space, turn on extra storage so Google can manage and backup your voicemail messages.</string> <string name="voicemail_error_inbox_full_turn_archive_on_title">Turn on extra storage and backup</string> <string name="voicemail_error_inbox_full_turn_archive_on_message">Your mailbox is full. To free up space, turn on extra storage so Google can manage and backup your voicemail messages.</string> <string name="voicemail_action_turn_archive_on">Turn on</string> <string name="voicemail_action_dimiss">No Thanks</string> At this point, I should say that there are a few different things this could be, and I'm at a loss for which one it is. For starters, this could be a new aspect for Project Fi subscribers and the included voicemail service. If so, it might mean Google intends to prompt people with a lot of saved voicemails to push the older ones into their Drive storage. It's a simple explanation, and might be an attempt to squeeze a few bucks out of people that never delete anything, but hardly seems necessary. Another possibility is that this only relates to the voicemails downloaded and stored on your phone, which means it's just a basic housekeeping feature to keep unnecessary audio files out of your local storage or expand the quota to allow for more. I tend to doubt this is the explanation because the text doesn't really line up with that purpose and it seems like the type of thing that should happen automatically, users shouldn't even need to be prompted. Finally, I'm going to take the opportunity to speculate about something a little crazy. Perhaps this is intended for the voicemail service provided by other carriers. If this is the case, I imagine the phone app might detect your voicemail is nearing capacity and offers to manage backups of it. If the user agrees, Google will connect to that provider's voicemail and proceed to back up all of the messages to Drive for the user, then delete them to free up space. Again, this is massively speculative and feels like a long shot... But it's also the type of weirdly cool feature Google occasionally comes up with. There's not much else to go on with this, but it's entirely possible this feature / warning / error message is already live. It may only show up for users connecting to a specific carrier or with special circumstances that aren't very predictable. I'm not really the right person to test it since I only have three voicemails saved, but perhaps readers with a larger backlog will have something to add to this.

John Unfortunately, many features don't work on the patched version. There are older official versions available for non-Nexus devices at apkmirror. Version 9.something is the latest. We will likely never see an official version. Previous official versions that work on non-Nexus phones were mistakes that were pulled. Samsung and others modify their dialers so that Google Phone doesn't work well unless the stock apps are disabled which may require root. Carlos Rodríguez Midly related, but SMS backups are coming to Nexus devices on O. If you toggle the switch of and on in Settings > System > Backup, a new option for SMS backup appears, just like on the Pixel. Cheers! Lynxy Dear lord, you're right! I'll try to test that the next time I reset the phone while on O. Alex I don't see that option. Nexus 6P in the UK. Latest O version. Carlos Rodríguez In phone settings > system > backup, turn off the switch for backup in Google Drive, then turn it back on. You'll see the SMS backup like on the Pixel. Alex Hmm, that requires deleting what's already backed up. I think I'll skip this until it is rolled out properly. Thanks for the help though. Carlos Rodríguez Yes, deletes the backup, but makes a new one as soon you turn it on. No loss of data actually. Fayas Android O on Nexus 5X. can't see that option to backup SMS. Carlos Rodríguez It only appeared for me when I turned backup off and on. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/6e53aa283e8271597b15df245154ecc06126d368853b89fa516c6076dbf49ac2.jpg Fayas Thanks, I got it after turning off and on back. But it shows me as waiting to back up for SMS and Call Log. Don't know why. Carlos Rodríguez It will eventually back up the SMS. The call log is stil waiting. James Well according to Google's implementation of the omtp visual voicemail standard (https://source.android.com/devices/tech/config/voicemail) it's vvm client "Fetches details of voicemail quota (total mailbox size and occupied size)" from the carrier so it's probably for carriers that have implemented the stock omtp vvm standard like t-mobile. James Briano Tangentially related: Anyone else getting errors with the phone app on Dev Preview 2? App keeps crashing when I have an incoming call. Nexus 6P. Cody Toombs I haven't put the SIM card into my 6P for more than a couple of minutes since the developer previews started going on there, so I can't comment to that exact scenario, but it has been working perfectly on my Pixel running 7.1.2. I've had pretty regular issues with Google apps crashing on DP1 and DP2. It may be a coincidence, but it seems especially bad for any app that uses hardware components like GPS and cellular radio. I'm not complaining since we all should know the deal with bleeding edge releases, but I think the O developer previews have been the buggiest I've used since Google started with KitKat. Andy J "It's not yet clear if attachments will be shown on the screen with incoming calls, but I think it's a pretty safe bet that they will be." Yes - yes it is. All the stuff people are left wondering about is covered in a LOT of depth in the Universal Profile spec - in this particular case, selecting a photo to be shown on the receivers screen when the phone call comes in - is specifically detailed in the spec. It's worth also being aware that as it's also specifically in the spec that the phone book must expose which contacts support Universal Profile - that I'd expect both the contacts app and the dialer app to be opened up to all devices on the Play Store before too much longer - otherwise only Messages supports RCS and people will have phones where they can't actually tell if they can make a video call or send someone a file (or their location) - all they can do is send them a message. mike shwilly Can i just have Swipe to Delete sms feature? Manikandan Guru Working fine on my OP3T. aRvInD Instead of this pretty useless idea, I wish Google places Redial button in same place. Which more people will find relevant and useful... hp-fourtwenty double tap the dial button to redial. tap it once to see the last number dialed. aRvInD No you misunderstood context. I wrote about redial only with call doesn't connect or failed without connecting.. After call disconnects then open dialer - double tap dialer, Simple button there to redial wouldve been great.. F4LL0U7 It's really frustrating that with all of these enhancements, there STILL isn't a way to use your Google Voice number by default instead of your carrier number. You can set the option to place all calls through GV, but if I try to send an SMS follow-up to a rejected call, or send an SMS through Assistant, it still uses the carrier number.

[Update: Now $75 Off] Deal Alert: Pixel 32GB (international version) is $50 off on eBay Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/05/26 2:20pm PDTMay 26, 2017 2 Plus 1 on G+ 42 Share on Facebook 56 Share on Twitter Total Shares100 Deals News Pixel Update 1: 2017/05/26 2:32pm PDT It looks like the price has dropped another $25, making this a $75 savings in total. For a device that hasn't seen much in the way of price drops or It's no secret that Google has had some serious supply issues with its flagship Pixel phone. That goes for pretty much any combination of size, color, or storage. Rumors even began to surface alleging that Google had stopped production of the devices altogether. That wasn't the case, but nonetheless, you will still struggle to actually find the Pixel if you wish to buy it. A 32GB Pixel (international version) on eBay for $50 off the list price could be the answer to that problem. This is the entry level 5" Pixel, with 32GB of storage in the color Very Silver - and it's available for $599. That's $50 less than the $649 Google is still charging for it. Beware though, this is the international version of the device. So if you live in the US you'll have to check the bands to see if it works on your network. This version won't play nice with Verizon or Sprint, so if you're on either of those carriers you can rule this out. If you live outside the US then this is definitely for you. Shipping appears to be free in the US, but here in the UK, it's $18.99. That still works out a bargain for me, especially if you account for the exchange rate. You'll have to do the sums from where you are to see if the deal is as good for you. It's worth mentioning that getting your warranty honored might be tough with this type of purchase, so bear that in mind. It's hard to say how many of these they have, other than a "limited quantity," so you'll have to be quick if you want to get your hands on arguably the best Android phone of 2016. Update 1: 2017/05/26 2:32pm PDT It looks like the price has dropped another $25, making this a $75 savings in total. For a device that hasn't seen much in the way of price drops or sales since launch, $75 off isn't bad. Anyone interested in a Pixel that uses a network compatible with this international model should give it a serious think.

Andy What do you mean? jonzey231 If you don't buy the phone from Google, they won't help you. They send you to the manufacturer. I was forced to go to Huawei for my 6P and it was a little over 3 weeks before I got it back....and the problem is still there. Spend the extra $50 and buy it through Google so you're guaranteed to get support through their CS channels. You'll be glad you did in 6 months when something inevitably goes wrong. IMHO get the OnePlus 3T. Costs less but has better overall specs aside from the camera which is still pretty good in its own right. My brother has one and my roommate just got his last week and they both have no intention of going back to a major brand ever again. YaKillaCJ Same happened when I got the OnePlus One. It changed the way I (and many others) view a "budget" device from an unknown brand. needa I felt the same way after using an OPO for nearly three years. Got me an XL in mint condition for $450. Google edition even. Still had 3520 mAh in the batt too. Would have bought the black 3T had they been in stock. Took me three days to hunt down this deal. Andy Got my wife the pixel. Runs great. Just had the microphone problem. Google swapped without question. Wife seems to think it takes horrible selfies. Rod Weird, as it's cameras are regarded among the best currently. Random! @andy maybe you should let her know that the camera isn't the problem... It's actually her face. If you do warn her about this, I promise to visit you at the hospital. Andy Thanks for the tip. VAVAMk_2 Huzzah! Master Yates Agreed with you regarding the 3T. Lets see if the excellent updates and support evaporate when the One Plus 5 is released? That's the real test. IcerC Except in this case Google is the Manufacturer, that might change things. VAVAMk_2 Google didn't make the camera. Uses a Sony made sensor but the camera software is Google's and regarded among the best in post processing, particularly HDR.

Other than that (impossible) scenario, I'd rather get the 3T, Axon 7, or even the LG G5. Gjorgi Lazarovski The Pixel is probably not dropping in price anytime soon. iKon The most overrated smartphone of 2016. Only the camera is decent. Ugly ass design, overpriced and dull with no features compared to competition Roy You mean the best smartphone of 2016, best camera rare band front, best software, best updates. Great battery, great display. xyz No, he means "The most overrated smartphone of 2016. Only the camera is decent. Ugly ass design, overpriced and dull with no features compared to competition." Roy No, I'm sure he/she means "the best smartphone of 2016, best camera rare band front, best software, best updates. Great battery, great display". iKon No I meant what I said. The pixel is a flop and even Google knows it. No matter how much money they put into advertising there are alot of better choices out there.. only hard core Google fanboys try and big it up Roy Yes yada yada and still every reviewer said is the best smartphone of 2016. So.. even David here. In the on of the day it's a lots about the UI and I just don't like Samsung software. Ordeith LOL. You're such a Google sycophant, Roy. Roy You feeling really smart? I'm Imagine your ass all over your face. nirmitlamed Google is so off track in figuring out what customers wants and competing against the other monstrous companies. I would very much like to hear how many Pixels Google sold in the last year since they told us they sold more than they expected. Lawrence I can put my coffee cup on the Bezel David Nowicki I'm a big Nexus fan, but why would you pay $749 for the Pixel XL vs the OnePlus 3T at about half the price ? And soon the OnePlus 5 at $450 or so with S8+ specs will be a steal compared to the Pixel 4Ui812 Supply and demand. Limit the supply and you increase demand. It's like P.T.

Google argued that it was too financially burdensome and logistically challenging to compile and hand over salary records that the government has requested, sparking a strong rebuke from the US Department of Labor (DoL), which has accused the Silicon Valley firm of underpaying women.  Google officials testified in federal court on Friday that it would have to spend up to 500 hours of work and $100,000 to comply with investigators’ ongoing demands for wage data that the DoL believes will help explain why the technology corporation appears to be systematically discriminating against women. Noting Google’s nearly $28bn annual income as one of the most profitable companies in the US, DoL attorney Ian Eliasoph scoffed at the company’s defense, saying, “Google would be able to absorb the cost as easy as a dry kitchen sponge could absorb a single drop of water.” The tense exchanges in a small San Francisco courtroom emerged in the final day of testimony in the most high-profile government trial to date surrounding the intensifying debate about the wage gap and gender discrimination in the tech industry. The DoL first publicly accused Google of “systemic compensation disparities” during a hearing in April, saying a preliminary inquiry had found that the Mountain View tech firm underpays women across positions. The current court battle stems from the DoL’s lawsuit filed against Google in January, accusing the company of violating federal laws by refusing to provide salary history and contact information of employees as part of a government audit. As a federal contractor, Google is required to comply with equal opportunity laws and allow investigators to review records. Labor officials have said they uncovered pay disparities in a 2015 snapshot of salaries and that investigators needed an earlier snapshot and compensation history of the employees to better understand the wage gap. The agency has also argued that it needs contact information of employees so it can conduct confidential interviews.  “This is obviously a very time-consuming and burdensome project,” said Lisa Barnett Sween, one of Google’s attorneys, claiming that the company has already worked 2,300 hours at a cost of nearly $500,000 to partially comply with the government’s demands, which she argued were broad and unconstitutional. “Our courts must act to check this abuse of power.” Google has vehemently denied the claims that it underpays women, claiming that it has closed its gender pay gap globally and that in the US it provides equal pay across races. Google has also argued that the DoL’s data request would violate the privacy of employees and fourth amendment rights against unreasonable search and seizure. In one revealing exchange, Frank Wagner, the company’s director of compensation, admitted in court that if women are paid less than men in the same positions, those salary disparities can persist even if the employees perform at the same level. Asked about a hypothetical, Wagner explained that if a female employee starts at a lower salary than a male colleague in the same job at Google, she may continue to make less even if they both excel in their first year and score the same on evaluations. Wagner claimed that eventually, their wages would likely be adjusted to match each other: “There would be convergence over time.” Eliasoph, the DoL attorney, said that it was outrageous for Google to argue that historical salary data was irrelevant to the government’s audit, considering it is widely understood that discriminatory wages lead to continued disparities as women advance in their careers. “This claim requires putting one’s head in the sand with respect to 30 years of law on pay discrimination.” Kristin Zmrhal, Google’s senior legal operations manager, also testified that the process of compiling data for the DoL has required engineers, lawyers and employees across departments to build new systems, conduct extensive quality reviews of files, redact documents and complete other complex tasks. “It became too burdensome,” she said, noting Google was forced to hire a third-party vendor to help. “The team was bogged down.” Eliasoph pointed out that Google has consistently earned millions in lucrative government contracts and has recently announced “with great public fanfare” that it invested $150m in diversity initiatives. “Google cannot claim ... that it now has no money to comply with a federal agency seeking to ensure compliance with equal opportunity laws on behalf of the public.” He also claimed that Google, with more than 21,000 employees, was trying to present itself as “too big to comply” and that the company should not be able to skirt anti-discrimination laws just because it is large and has a complex compensation model: “Google takes routine requests and makes them sound onerous by emphasizing the number of people involved.”  Sween asserted that Google has complied with the “overwhelming majority” of the government’s demands, adding, “The agency has little if any regard for the fourth amendment rights of its contractors.” Earlier this month, the tech firm’s lawyers also unsuccessfully argued that the case should be dismissed altogether, claiming that a DoL official may have violated ethics rules by talking to the Guardian about the federal investigation. In that interview in April, regional solicitor Janet Herold said that the initial data suggested that “discrimination against women in Google is quite extreme, even in this industry”. Surveys have repeatedly found that women are often paid less than men for the same jobs across Silicon Valley. An account of sexual harassment at Uber earlier this year has also sparked a widespread debate about misogyny and misconduct in tech. Google is one of three powerful Silicon Valley firms to face DoL lawsuits related to discrimination claims over the last year.  Go to MSN Home Go to MSN News Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry!

Jide Remix Mini Android Desktop PC Review: Interesting Software Let Down By Bargain-Bin Hardware Michael Crider Follow View All Posts 2015/12/19 9:00am PDTDec 19, 2015 79 Plus 1 on G+ 35 Share on Facebook 0 Share on Twitter Total Shares114 News Reviews Article Contents 1 Specs 1.1 Hardware 1.2 Software 1.3 Applications 1.4 Performance 1.5 Conclusion Android is many things. A mobile operating system, a tool for smart watches and set-top boxes, and much more. But one of the things it most certainly is not is a desktop OS... at least in its current form. That said, it's also the world's biggest piece of open-source software, so when Jide decided to make what it calls "the world's first true Android PC," they were more than free to do so. Whether or not it's a good idea is a subject for discussion... and this review. Specs Processor 1.2GHz quad-core Allwinner A53 RAM 2GB Storage 16GB, MicroSD card slot Wireless Wi-Fi b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.0 Battery AC Adapter OS Android 5.1 Dimensions 124 x 88 x 26mm Price $69.99 Colors Black Buy Amazon With the Remix Mini, you get a tiny Roku-sized box that, at least technically, works like a desktop PC. Plug in a monitor or television via the standard HDMI port, add a mouse and keyboard (either via USB or Bluetooth), connect it to the Internet via Wi-Fi or a standard Ethernet port, and you're good to go. And as odd an idea as an Android-powered desktop might seem like on the surface, the Remix Mini manages to be much more than the sum of its figurative parts, thanks to some impressive work on the software. Jide has successfully adapted Android into a keyboard-and-mouse interface, or at least much more of one than any previous attempts, like ASUS' Transformer tablets. Unfortunately, the Remix Mini is almost exactly the sum of its literal parts - even for its super-cheap $70 price tag, the performance is objectively terrible. It might do for a guest machine or a somewhat underpowered set-top box... but unfortunately, there are other devices that fill both roles effectively, for comparable prices. Hardware The Remix Mini looks quite a lot like a Roku. Or a Nexus Player, or an Amazon Fire TV, or any of the other vaguely interchangeable hockey pucks that hide behind your TV. The difference is that this one is intended to act like a desktop computer. Around back are an HDMI port, two standard USB ports, a headphone/microphone jack (though audio through HDMI works as well), a MicroSD card slot, and a proprietary power port. There's no power button on the device, at least not at first glance. The printed logo on the top hides a capacitive button - just tap it to power the gadget on or off. Other than that, it's extremely nondescript. You can hide it behind a desk or monitor (with a little tape - there's no mounting solution), or even slip it in a pocket for travelling. You'll have to fill the other pocket with the power and HDMI cords, and since you're bringing a bag for the mouse and keyboard, you might as well put it all in there. Crack open the plastic and you'll find specifications that completely fail to wow. The Remix Mini is based on a 1.2GHz quad-core 64-bit SoC from Allwinner - not the most auspicious start. There are two models advertised on Jide's site, one with just 1GB of RAM and 8GB of storage, and the other with 2GB and 16GB, respectively. The only one being sold on Amazon is the latter, for $69.99, and it's the one we were sent to review. You'll also get Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and Ethernet support. Even for the low price, the specs are underwhelming. With no battery, screen, mobile radio, et cetera, I would have expected some of the more core specs to be better. I understand that Jide was going for the absolute smallest price possible, but it comes at the cost of performance - more on that later. Software Remix OS is what Android would be if you tried to turn it into a PC with a mouse and keyboard UI. And considering that the developers needed to tweak or rewrite very nearly everything at the core of the operating system, it's actually quite impressive. Remix's interface runs on top of Android 5.1, and despite some of the extreme changes, includes full access to the Google Play Store and other Google services. The desktop is, well, a desktop. It's an impressive copy of most of the paradigms that Windows users will be familiar with. Windows is definitely the template here, not OS X, any flavor of Linux, or even Chrome, with the main "start" button on the lower-left corner, a taskbar full of currently-running apps, and a set of tools in the lower-right. Each Android app opens as its own window, which can be dragged around, resized, and generally messed with in a familiar way. My Microsoft keyboard and mouse set played nice with the UI; the Windows key opened the start menu, most of the familiar keyboard shortcuts worked, even the semi-proprietary media controls were functional. Windows can be opened and closed in the usual way, and apps downloaded from the Play Store work as you'd expect them to. Up to a point, anyway - obviously the transition from a touchscreen UI to mouse and keyboard has a few hiccups. Starting up Remix OS for the first time is a bit of a chore. My review unit immediately needed a software update, which took the better part of two hours. And if you have a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse ready and waiting, you might need to grab something else: there's no way to connect Bluetooth accessories before the initial setup for Remix and Google's services, so you must have a USB mouse at the very least. Once you start to actually use the device, everything sort of falls into place. You might almost believe you were using a heavily-skinned version of Google's Chrome OS, but Remix has the advantage of access to the full complement of Play Store apps. Resizing and repositioning, including fullscreen view, is possible in every app. That said, the apps usually launch in their ideal forms (usually utilizing a tablet interface), and manually resizing them is awkward and often results in worse use of space. The intersection between the windowed apps and the total desktop UI can be awkward as well - for instance, clicking the "fullscreen" button in the YouTube app will make the video extend to the edges of the window, but then you have to click the fullscreen button on the window itself to see the video as large as possible. Clicking on the hamburger menu on the far right of the taskbar will open up the notifications in a fashion very similar to Windows 10, though you also get a peek at them as they come in, Lollipop-style. The desktop UI doesn't lend itself well to widgets, which is probably why you can't put any on the main screen - if you want to see them, you'll have to click the Start button, then click the Widgets button, at which point an OS X-style screen used only for the widgets will appear. A final note: at the moment Remix works only at resolutions of 720p or 1080p. That's fine if you're planning on using the Remix Mini with a TV or a cheap monitor, but if you have a 16:10 or 4:3 ratio screen, the image will be stretched out with no real fix. Applications Remix includes only a few apps by default: the Play Store, Play Movies, Docs, Sheets, Slides, Gmail, and Chrome from Google, plus customized versions of a calculator, download manager, file explorer, Settings menu, a user feedback tool, and the aforementioned Widgets screen. There's also an app called simply "RAR" that can compress or decompress files. Other than that, you'll be getting everything from the Play Store or from manual APK installations, even some ubiquitous apps like YouTube and Netflix. And this kind of works, if only because Jide seems to have intentionally made the core operating system as minimalist as possible. Though Remix OS is not too difficult to get into, the usual mishmash of manufacturer bloatware wouldn't help. Performance The Remix Mini runs like its trying to swim through molasses on a high-gravity planet. It's not the only problem with the relatively novel hardware and software, but it's definitely the deal-breaker for me. Just getting Chrome to open a page can be a pain, and just about every action on the device takes several seconds to complete. Video is jittery with errors in sound playback (so forget about using this as a media player), and high-end games simply will not run. Even simple games like 2048 stutter and chug. And keep in mind, this is on the better of the two configurations, with 2GB of RAM - I can only assume that the 1GB version is much worse. The focus on an interface that's more complex than standard Android, and is designed to allow reasonable multi-tasking, is probably the reason for this slow performance. And I don't want to be too hard on the Remix Mini, since it is offering a combination of hardware and software that's fairly unique. But the fact remains that this kind of performance would be damning even for a budget phone, to say nothing of something that bills itself as a desktop PC alternative. Conclusion The Remix Mini is cool. It's like a Raspberry Pi for people (like me) who couldn't program their way through a decoder ring cypher. And Jide deserves points for their software, which expands Android in ways that simply can't be found on any other product. But unfortunately, that software still has a lot of little kinks to work out before it feels like a "real" desktop OS. And on top of that, the bargain bin hardware inside the Remix Mini makes it screech to a halt when it's trying to do, well, pretty much anything. If you're looking for a sub-$100 desktop, you'd be better served by a Chrome-powered gadget like the Asus Chromebit. If you're looking for a set-top box, any of the various Roku designs is an easy pick. If you want a tiny Android-powered desktop machine, you might want to check out Jide's products... in another year or two. The Remix Mini is simply too unfinished and too underpowered to recommend.

Tomasz Kucza For me it would also need a full browser. Mobile Chrome is very limited. sproc $150 can net you a decent win10 box. Problem is, it is win10 :) -Matoro Zeliph- I like the software interface. This is what it should be like when connecting your android phone to a dock and monitor. Eh well, maybe we'll get that someday. Kawshik Ahmed Actually Motorola had such technology called Webtop which turned Android phones into Desktop like OS when connected into a dock. Google removed Webtop after they bought Motorola. Google shouldn't have done this the technology would have improved much by now. Motorola had desktop and laptop dock before MS Continuum -Matoro Zeliph- Yeah. It's a shame. Daniel Marcus Unfortunately, WebTop was removed well before Google bought Motorola Mobility. Roh_Mish The laptop part actually make for a good Raspberry Pi terminal. I have seen a few people using it online. Aabhas I must say, RpiB2 with a preloaded sd card works very well. Only if someone could optimize the remix Android for that. Ubuntu Mate works fine. Android, being lighter, should work much faster. ethd Remix OS would perform worse on a Raspberry Pi 2 than on this. I'm not just being intentionally difficult, either: This Remix Mini has better hardware in every aspect as compared to the Raspberry Pi 2 and still doesn't work well. I think you don't realize just how incredibly lightweight Ubuntu MATE is, even compared to Android. I’jaaz Tello Well, yeah, Android use compiled code and seems to have memory issues. Something that most of Linux doesn't have an issue with. I mean, I ran a box that had ChromeOS + Ubuntu running side by side on 1 gig of ram and 16 gigs of solid state. It worked just fine ethd Not to sound like a jerk, but I don't think you totally understand what you're talking about. Linux uses code compiled ahead of time and has practically since the beginning. Since Lollipop, Android does too. The memory leak issue is definitely real though. I’jaaz Tello You do sound like a jerk. But yes, I do know. I said compiled as in compiled ahead of time.... Lemme quote myself, I said "compiled code" as in past tense code. I do understand how confusing that could sound, but I did mean "compiled" code. Because that is what happens to the code. The runtime compiler stuff is long gone. What I meant was that programmers might have a better understanding of how memory was allocated if they used C to program their applications. As in, what certain programmers do on Linux. I’jaaz Tello Duh!! Brain fart there. Yeah, me knows all that. I've actually compiled some code me self. But the code is more low level, right? I was pretty sure (I could be wrong) that C had more memory allocation control than Java.... Again, dunno what I was thinking. I must have been half asleep. I mean, I compile things on Linux all the time, and I know that Lollipop finally made that happen. Though the main thing I like about Linux is that I can run something like Arch that gives me more control over what runs as a process. That really makes things snappy, y'know? Though you're right about the memory leaks. That's the biggest bummer. Oh, and the crappy skins certain manufacturers put on android. ethd It's true that code in C is lower level, but it's also worth noting that there's nothing stopping developers from using C or C++ on Android, and in fact many game developers do. Java is just an order of magnitude easier than those two languages, especially for apps simpler than games. Michael Carr Part of Android's heft and relative sluggishness in real-world usage comes from the Google apps. They've been getting heavier over the last few years, and phones that were speedy 12 months ago can feel slower now with the same (fully-updated) list of installed apps. ethd The great thing about Remix OS is that it doesn't let any app run in the background by default, including Google's. You have to explicitly enable it. But on the flipside, that means that this computer's shoddy performance isn't because of Google's apps. OhLongJohnson Many of the Amazon reviews point out they were Kickstarter backers. Even if this isn't a power house, I am glad to see a project actually be completed and shipped out to backers. David Onter Yes, there were no delays at all. There was the Kickstarter campaign which I supported and I got my Remix last month, just like announced. ethd This is disappointing, but I kinda expected this. An Allwinner 1.2GHz 64-bit SoC seemed like a recipe for horrible performance - I'm sure it's the CPU more than anything that is causing such disappointing performance. I've been running Jide's official Remix OS on my Nexus 10 for the past few months and it's pretty awesome. I still kinda want to give this a try despite its lousy performance. Tomasz Kucza It may also be flash. Slow flash can kill any device's performance. ethd True enough. I remember my old (now broken and discarded) Nexus 7 2012 with fantastic SoC performance with its Tegra 3 and utterly horrible flash performance that made the device unusable when it was, for example, installing updates from Google Play. Joeyfrombklyn And a fast stable internet connection, I would think help things move a little smoother. ethd It would help Internet-related stuff of course, but it doesn't sound like a lot of the flaws of the Remix Mini are caused by a bad or mediocre connection. Joeyfrombklyn Yes correct, I was struck by the authors complaint of web pages loading painfully slow and thought about hearing people bitch about devices being slow and a lot of times it can be a slow internet connection. Best. Jfb. David Onter The flash is quite fast, installing Apps is very quick (quicker than on my HTC One M8). Slowpoke Allwinner? I thought they were dead. It's even worse than a MediaTek. Still, the UI seems excellent, and it looks very familiar for a Windows 10 user. someone755 Quite honestly I was impressed by the UI from the screenshots. The disappointment came when I read "Allwinner" for the first time in my life though, and it only went downhill from there. I expected a price this low to pack more punch, since most bells and whistles are removed from its phone/tablet counterpart (most notably the display, mobile radios, and various buttons and sensors), but this kind of performance couldn't justify 20€ in my book.

Rolo Nieves MediaTek SoCs at least works decently, but Allwinner... F**k. Faheem Ahmed no gps,gyrsoscope.compass Daniel Marcus Interestingly, that sort of UI is not as rare as you might think. I just got a Cube T8 which is backed by a MediaTek processor. It includes a very similar windowing feature, and the processor on this tablet seems to handle it just fine. Alexander Trust It might be and older version of Remix OS because Cube is one of Remix' partners, cf. http://www.jide.com/en/remixos/devices Daniel Marcus Oh, you might be right! I have the Cube T8. Good to see Teclast on there too. Cube and Teclast are both great budget tablet OEMs. TedPhillips remixOS has been on my todo list check out for a while. they seem to have the best 'productivity' implementation of android so far. iirc their tablet was much more powerful, tegra 4 maybe? need to look into if there is any device i already have i can put it on. probably not though. seems like an adt-1 might be a good fit for a sup'ed up remix desktop, though. TedPhillips remind me, did AP do a review on the Jide Ultra (tablet)? Sebastian Gorgon that software is what Chrome OS needs to be, it's what Pixel C was born to run. TedPhillips i agree, gut check would be that they should offer a build for pixel C owners. beat google to the punch on their own hardware. Niels There are already builds available for Nexus 10 and Nexus 9 (http://www.jide.com/en/remixos/devices), so a build for Pixel C is a real possibility. I don't know how unlockable Pixel C's bootloader is though, is it as easy as a Nexus? Roh_Mish Pixel devices were easy to unlock till now. C should be easy to unlock too Deckard_Cain When I select the individual screenshots on this article, the image doesn't zoom in. Increase the resolution so we can see better the screenshots! Caleb Escamilla IV been rocking the remix mini for over a month and a half and yes the softwear is jittery at times but the company is one that actually listen to its end users and is working on updating the softwear as quickly as the can. They truly understand that with out the end users feed back there nothing. I believe that this mini Android PC is going to become an amazing product and would recommend it to anyone willing to be on the edge of technology and willing to send feed back at stress test to the Jedi team to look at and fix Mi II Lo To me that's a big problem Caleb, people more willing to bitch about spending $60 on what in essence is an experimental device and being disappointed; instead of going straight to customer support with the issue and then calmly waiting for a resolution. Jide has answered my 5 issues (only two relate to a device issue) within what I thought was a reasonable time. One device Issue was fixed with the second patch update before I got a written response! So yeah I spent $100 on two of the 2gb devices and both are working good for me. I am also involved in the community because I am hoping it succeeds! Omar F. Rodriguez Morales Mmm maybe this device was ment for regular use like checking social media, emails and so, not anything pretty demanding, i would definitely use like a kiosk just to show a web app using chrome browser Joeyfrombklyn Agreed I think that's what this is meant for, at this point in time, with a fast stable internet connection it should serve people well enough to do the basics. David Onter It is. Just watch some interviews, etc. Their slogan is also "Finally, less can be more". Omar F. Rodriguez Morales It's not a beast like the nvidia shield, maybe it's in the same level with the nexus player, I like NP for the TV although, this could be a good distraction if I really really need a mouse and a keyboard Tsun_Pooka I like that the interface is really similar to Windows 10, and that's impressive on an Android setup. Is there any way to get Remix OS as a dual boot with Windows 10 then? Joeyfrombklyn I have to agree for the most part concerning performance, but for some on tight budgets this may be a viable option for light web browsing, email, I think the concept is fantastic and as others have commented the UI looks very nice, hopefully someone will ( get it ) and get the hardware a bit more robust 1st one to market will sell a shit ton of them. Paul Maybe it's the review kit you have but I don't have any issues playing catch up video or live streaming from my own DLNA box, Google Movies, NOW TV and YouTube (Play Music doesn't work but they are working on a fix for that. Between my Chromecast (which is being used only for Play Music now) and my Remix Mini I have a great media player device. It is hooked up to my TV and works brilliantly far better than I expected, it's hidden out the way, goes to sleep when not in use a simple move of the mouse wakes it up. I bought two of these via the KickStarter project. Gave one to my mother and she loves it, got to grips with it right away as she has an android phone so 99% of it works the same just on a bigger screen (also helps when she has a tech issue I know how to help her out). For basic stuff like email, web browsing (yes a desktop chrome browser would be nice) playing music, listening to the radio, watching tv and movies it's a great little device and hasn't slowed down once for me even when using multiple windows, for example I have used WPS Office and a browser for research, while listening to YouTube music playlists and having email open I didn't see any issues at all. And not forgetting it's very portable so on away trips I simply plug it into the hotels TV HDMI and I have everything as if at home. EzequielBruni Ok, right now I'm using my laptop to run a pseudo-smart TV. While this might not be a great production desktop, do ya'll think it could run a TV just fine? The desktop interface works from me. I need to use it with a VPN, and also want to stream games from my desktop a la Steam In-home streaming. (Yay for the ethernet port!) Think it would work for all of that? David Onter Nah, keep your laptop. bpcooper14 Fill disclosure. I am one of the kickstarter backers. In my experience with the month I have used the mini, I've been impressed with the updates to address some of the issues users have encountered. I think I've gotten 3 updates thus far. Is it a powerhouse desktop replacement? Nope. I've been able to watch movies, browser the web, work within Microsoft documents, and lite gaming. For the $40 I paid, I got my monies worth and it will continue to improve. Version 2 will no doubt address complement concerns people might have. Great first effort in my opinion. Faheem Ahmed wish they launch a launcher in playstore @androidpolice David Onter Running several apps in windows at the same time is not just a launcher... Faheem Ahmed BUT MAN LOOK AT BRIGHT SIDE....HAVE U USED FIREFOXOS DE FOR ANDORID..ITS A LAUNCHER!! @FIREFOX Faheem Ahmed NO VGA,NO TEGRAX1,NO OPENSOUSCE larry9 I love the concept and it sounds like the software part of this product is very sound. Often a "new concept" product is introduced on very capable hardware, soon followed by a budget version. It seems they could now fairly quickly launch the more capable version. For twice the hardware cost the performance should be way way better. David Onter I also received mine a few weeks ago and was honestly suprised by how decent it is software-wise. The hardware on the other hand is pretty bad. The SoC costs 5$, is advertised as "the most cost-efficient 64bit-chipset on the market" and gets a score of 21363 on AnTuTu. The performance is overall alright, even if some glitches have to be expected. I also noticed that the audio chip the Mini uses is really bad (probably the built-in one), even though there's an "output raw audio signal"-option in the settings which I haven't tested yet. If somebody is curious which version of Android is underneath of Remix OS 2.0, it's Android 5.1. I'm not a native speaker and writing longer texts is a pain for me, so I'll write some more things as a list: *) The "RAR" app that is preinstalled is simply the compression app by WinRar from the Play Store which can be installed on about every device. *) The Mini is supposed to support 4k too, but it currently doesn't reliably work. Jide is working with Allwinner on an Update that should address this. *) Jide's support is great and they're normaly very direct. They also have an own forum and regulary ask questions/involve the community in the development on their social channels. *) There have been no informations concerning root or custom development so far, but at least Allwinner isn't known for their dev support. We'll see. *) The company Jide-Tech is a Chinese-based startup founded by 3 Ex-Googlers. *) Jide has forshadowed that they're working on a "Pro"-model several times and are already asking on Facebook what people would expect from it. Gaurav Arora I think their next hardware model will be the one to look out for! Alex Lees I ordered the 2GB model from Kickstarter. Got charged €19 for customs. Probably wouldn't have bought if that was the case although it does state customs charges may apply. I'm selling mine, I haven't even opened it. They sent it with a european adapter even though I asked them to change it for a UK one, they refused. The UK plug was added as an option after I'd pledged so I originally chose European. Lord_Santa If Jide have any sense, they will port Remix OS 2.0 to the Pixel C. Zan Zac Zac I have exactly the same version. i think that performance-wise it is what i had expected. I have installed Kodi and popcorn time and they work flawlessly. Even 1080p does not stutter. The processor does its job for the purpose i bought it for. Which is not 3d gaming or other power user tasks. In my opinion, with the excellent support taken into consideration, it is worth it. wuafri I already use Android OS. as a dekstop with Vysor . Andrew M. Sheppard You just save me 12.00. I was going to purchase another copy of VMLite's VNC Viewer. I'd rather support Koush. Thanks! Mi II Lo I got to say I just did not have the troubles you did Michael. I mean I understand that it is not all they said it would be, and I admit I was hoping for better, but in my usage I have not come across all the lag and other troubles you are pointing out in your piece. Having said that, the forum has plenty of complaints about many things you wrote about, but just as many folks offering workarounds or other solutions. Jide is still pumping fixes and many would say they did rush out their product before it was fully baked. This is their initial offering however and if they can fix everything for everyone and upgrade their device then this should be very promising! There is also plenty of folks posting apps that work great and peripherals that are working. So as with all new devices and UI's mileage will vary! Said Tahsin Dane This customized Android OS would be a great fit for a cheap laptop. erick just get an intel/windows10 based pc/hdmi stick for the real deal. quad core Pentium with HD/4K graphics. Christopher Holly the only issue that I have had, was that the Kickstart unit I got, the capacitive button doesn't work. Sigh. Waiting still on RMA...But the unit works and seems to be totally usable, cruddy processor or not. It will hang occasionally, but my experience with using it for web browsing has been fairly positive. The OS is really usable for the desktop, compared to simply using the Android OS with HID. Gary Deezy I wonder how this would compare to the $100 intel compute sticks with 2GB of RAM and Win10? Tony i have a problem, when i try to reproduce videos on youtube app or instagram even in the main repro de os crash... help. sorry for my english Gugman ...so forget about using this as a media player... now that is a very bold statement, as I just watched mkv file from usb, nba game at 60fps around 5gb big with no issues at all, using Kodi as a player Titus C I do not care who the builder of the hardware is, remix mini works better as a 'smart' addition to my old plasma TV and now is more usable than my new Samsung Smart TV. I only use use Remix mini for reading emails and browsing and watching video streaming either from hbogo, youtube or my Synology nas located at my office (through DS video) and all of them work flawlessly. So for me is perfectly ok as is. Would have liked widgets - at least usual ones like clock and weather just to make the desktop a bit more friendly but not a big deal that they are mising. Bram Stolk Does it do OpenGL ES3 ? Иван Иванов A lot of crashes, the player does not read all the basic codecs or the video goes cracked. Sensor screen emulation is defective, and often the hero moves himself without doing anything. Honestly, I'm pretty disappointed. True, it's kind of cheap, but still ...

The most significant thing about the handset is that it runs on Android O. The listing the phone on Geekbench suggests that it will be a regular variant of Google's 2016 flagship. As you can see from the image, the model has managed to bag 1631 points on the single-core test, while it has received 3876 on the multi-core test. As we know, the average Google Pixel with Android Nougat scores more than 4000 points on the multi-core test. Also Read: Set of things you can do with Google Play Music Google recently announced the Android O at its I/O 2017 developer conference. During the announcement, Google claimed that the successor of Android Nougat will be more useful and deliver Fluid Experiences with features including Picture-in-picture, Notification Dots, Autofill with Google, and Smart Text Selection. Additionally, Android O will also come with TensorFlow Lite tech, some pertinent security enhancements, new developer tools, and a new programming language. Now, coming back to the Google Pixel phone, other features are still the same. This means that it comes equipped with a Snapdragon 821 chipset along with 4GB of LPDDR4 RAM. Android O will likely launch later this year, and we are assuming that it could feature with the upcoming Google Pixel 2. Rumors have it that it will be officially called the Android 8.0 Oreo. It will be made available first to Nexus and Pixel devices. It will then gradually make its way to other Android handsets from the different brands.

Sergey Brin in Switzerland earlier this year, probably thinking about how cool and important his big ol' airship will be when it's done. Image: GILLIERON/EPA/REX/Shutterstock By Brett Williams2017-05-26 18:17:29 UTC When you're a cofounder of one of the world's most valuable companies, your passion projects tend to take on a more massive scale than, say, simply tuning up an old hot rod in the garage. Take Google's Sergey Brin. Word leaked last month that he has a team working on a secret project in the Google-controlled Hangar 2 at the NASA Ames Research Center: a massive airship, or dirigible, which serves as a spiritual successor to one of the hangar's previous tenants, the USS Macon. Sources close to the project claimed that the metal frame of the craft, which looks like a zeppelin, was complete and taking up most of the space inside the hangar.       More sources "with knowledge of the project" have come forward, claiming to have new insider info about Brin's airship. The leakers spilled their secrets to The Guardian, giving us a better understanding about Brin's mission and exactly what he wants to do with his own personal sky yacht, which is ... go on lavish family vacations that double as humanitarian aid missions.  SEE ALSO: That massive plane that looks like a butt successfully flies now, so that's good news The sources claim Brin wants to use the craft both as a "luxurious intercontinental air yacht" for friends and family — and a vessel for humanitarian trips to deliver supplies and food to remote areas. The airship could wind up costing Brin $100 million to $150 million of his own money, so he can do with it what he wants. But the image of a gigantic vanity project miraculously touching down in an impoverished area, no matter its intentions, seems more than a touch dissonant.    The airship will reportedly stretch to nearly 200 meters (around 660 feet) in length and be "massive on a grand scale,” making it the biggest aircraft in the world right now, twice as long as the Airlander 10, aka the "Flying Bum." Brin's project won't quite measure up to the airships of old he's modeling it after, though. The USS Macon measured in at 239.3 meters (785 feet), and the largest, the Hindenburg class, was a massive 245.3 meters (803 feet). Brin's airship was originally slated to be powered by hydrogen, according to the sources. But the gas still apparently has a bad rep as fuel for airships, what with the legacy of the Hindenburg still fresh in our cultural consciousness after 80 years.  Brin's airship will instead depend on helium for lift and use a system of internal gas bladders to compensate when freight is removed during landings. Sources claim this will allow for off-loading almost anywhere in the world.  Neither Brin nor Google provided comment about any of the rumors about the airship, so until someone spots a massive zeppelin coasting through the California skies, we're likely going to be kept in the dark.  WATCH: Airbus’ new flying car concept looks like it's straight out of ‘The Jetsons' Topics: aircraft, Google, nasa-ames-research-park, Sergey Brin, Tech About Us Jobs Advertise Subscribe Privacy Terms Mashable is a global, multi-platform media and entertainment company.

There are 500 million of them sitting over on LinkedIn, which continues to add two new members at a steady rate. The secret to mastering LinkedIn for sales, however, lies in this helpful (and often ignored) feature hidden inside LinkedIn's powerful internal search engine. LinkedIn = B2B Prospecting Power The best way to go B2B prospecting online right now is to use LinkedIn’s massive internal search engine - like a Google for professionals. Because LinkedIn indexes every piece of content and word published on the site, you can search the platform using keywords and phrases (just like Google) to find what you're looking for. Even better, you can filter your LinkedIn Search results to display people, blog posts, status updates, company names, job openings or other professional topics based around those keywords or phrases you entered. When you understand the power of real-time, 1-on-1 personalization using the data available at any given moment on LinkedIn, that's when your B2B prospecting goes to a whole new level. Feeling Minnesota For example, it could be as simple as entering in a location (Minnesota), seeing someone bemoaning the weather there (a common occurrence) in a status update, and adding a comment to his or her post Even better, if this person seems like a potential sales lead or a good fit for your product or service, you can reach out and connect with him or her using the "Minnesota weather" angle as a personal note in your invitation. From that point forward, you can then begin to move your new connection (whom you've already broken the ice with) through your normal LinkedIn lead generation and sales cycle. How to Search for Posts In order to utilize this approach with LinkedIn Search, it’s important to step into the shoes of your customer and think like he or she would. Ask yourself this question: What would my ideal client or prospect type into Google when looking for content, tips or help related to a specific topic? Try and reverse-engineer the common topics, trends or thoughts your ideal clients have when searching for content or help online, and plug those terms into LinkedIn Search.  Next, filter by "Posts" and see what shows up. You can even try and search for terms like city names, state names or other markers to find people "talking" about those topics on LinkedIn (see the "Minnesota" example screenshot included in this post). It's important to note, the way LinkedIn filters its "post" search results depends on: If any of your 1st or 2nd level connections are sharing posts or status updates that include those search terms It then widens the search to anyone on LinkedIn using those search terms in an blog post or status update. Keep in mind, the "post" search results can return both blog posts others are creating that have your keywords and quick status updates someone fires off. Both are great opportunities to engage someone in their online living room, and use the content of their status update or blog post as context to begin a 1-on-1 conversation. See if you can add to the discussion, ideally by answering a question or adding a dose of your own wisdom that helps demonstrate your expertise in the area. LinkedIn & Real-Time Leads The idea is simple - you engage others around a topic they're talking about, and you do it in a way that isn't sales-y, sleazy or spammy. Rather, you add to the conversation, sharing your thoughts, answering questions or asking additional questions to keep the discussion going. Make sure you take some time today to experiment with LinkedIn Searches that you filter by posts, and be creative with your search terms and topics. If you do, you're likely going to find some warm leads and conversation opportunities waiting for you.

Google is now offering four free months of Google Play Music for new subscribers Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/26 2:17pm PDTMay 26, 2017 70 Plus 1 on G+ 511 Share on Facebook 83 Share on Twitter Total Shares664 Google News Right now it looks like Google is running a special offer for Google Play Music. New subscribers that sign up here can get four free months of service instead of the usual three. No telling how long this offer might last, so if you have been considering subscribing, now might be the time to do it. It could save you an extra $10. Again, this particular offer is only for new subscribers. I've been a fan of Play Music for a long time, though the device removal limit does get in the way when you switch between devices and ROMs as often as I do. Being able to mix your own library with those of a service also comes in handy. That way I can continue to support artists I am passionate about, without eschewing the larger selection of a subscription offering for the purposes of content discovery, all while being able to fill the gaps in that library. There are a lot of different music services out there, but if you're interested combining your curated library with music available via a subscription, then your options are limited. Spotify does allow you to play back locally stored files, which is convenient, but it isn't quite the same. Amazon also allows you to upload your music for playback via Amazon Music, and with Amazon Prime membership, you get a small library of streaming music to go along with that. For $10 a month ($8 for Prime members) you can access their full library as well. But, Google Play Music has a great interface and plugs nicely into all the other Google services we love. Maybe with this new offer, it's time you gave Google Play Music a chance? After all, even if it doesn't end up working out, you still got four free months of music out of the deal.

Carson Saldanha Wait, wdym 3 different countries? Did you share it with others or something? Ailín Ó’S I live in Ireland, so that's my main account. I have a secondary account based in England as part of a mail forwarder service I use, and my bf is Greek so I had him check the code on his account :) Carson Saldanha Oh wow! Carson Saldanha Hey, since I know it worked for you, are you able to use YouTube Red along with this Play Music free trial? Because my YT Red doesn't seem to be enabled for me. Ailín Ó’S No, unfortunately not as I live in the EU and YouTube Red is only available in USA. Carson Saldanha Weird, I'm in the US though. Ailín Ó’S Ooh that is odd. Sign out of the app then sign back in maybe? Carson Saldanha No luck :( I'm in contact with Google support atm Hopefully they can sort this out Mike Worth it alone for Youtube Red MisterAlex Sweet, I wasn't sure if that was included. Thanks. Should mention that in the main blog post. Ben Still no student membership >:( Ailín Ó’S Spotify is a great alternative @€$£5/month. Ben I know that's what I use just because it's half the price. Ailín Ó’S In Ireland Vodafone have a partnership with Spotify whereby it costs €5 standard instead of €10 regardless of if you're a student or not, they even bundle it with some of their plans. Vodafone do the same in some other countries they operate in (not all). Maybe see if any network in your country has a partnership like that? Worth a shot! Ben Oh yeah I'm on EE in the UK and I've got Apple Music for free for 6 months but like iTunes is a massive stinking turd. Ailín Ó’S I'd rather go back to the days of getting music via Bluetooth from friends than use crApple Music 😂😂 Rahul Krishna In india, we have play music for 1.4 usd/month Umang Ladia I'm only seeing 2 months offer in India.?? Rahul Krishna Well I subscribed to it when it launched here (about 2 months ago), so I can't confirm that. But at this price, there is nothing to be disappointed about. aRvInD I wish Spotify launches soon here. I can't keep using that patched version here...!! Rahul Krishna Me too xyz As it should be, you can't charge European or American prices in India. Rahul Krishna Yes true. There are lots​ of people here with a very cheap Android phone. They cannot pay much money. Julian Coronado That's actually what's keeping me away from Play Music. I've used my free months and I loved the Youtube Red too. But as a student, Spotify for $5 / month is too great to pass up on. Emiliejmosley Google is paying 97$ per hour! Work for few hours & have longer with friends and family! !sm141c: On tuesday I got a great new Land Rover Range Rover from having earned $8752 this last four weeks..

Cakefish Spotify ftw ToniCipriani ✓pǝᴉɟᴉɹǝʌ I don't think this is a new offer, got this a while back. In fact my 4 months is expiring next week. Prefer Spotify over it. Song selection a tad bit weaker, and for foreign songs it tries to translate the song names to English and makes it hard to look up. folkrav I like it, it's way cheaper than Spotify for me - my mother, my sister, my wife and myself each pay 30$ a year and we're set - but Jesus do I hate the clients. I don't like the website's interface, I hate the Android app. But yeah, I'll deal with it cause it's cheap, I guess. Carson Saldanha Got it! Yay! Jim I wish I could somehow get it on my Amazon Echo hahaha. I guess if I had paid for a Google Home it would be worth trying out. Forget vega #getEVGA Why google play music isn't available in my country ? Ailín Ó’S Try Apple Music? They seem to be just about everywhere. Iamsecond And this is why Apple continue to dominate, because Apple are truly interested in being an international company whereas Google is just playing at it. Such a shame xyz Because Google sucks. Bartek Juszczak My GPM radio's are so good these days I love that Google is so into AI. Whether It's just "I'm being lucky" or radio from a specific song, band or album they very rarely disappoint me these days. I just make sure to thumbs up if it plays a song I particularly love. I am a student and could go cheaper with spotify but the AI generated playlists have me locked in. If it's £5 cheaper but I'm not gonna enjoy it nearly as much then it's not really a good deal. AndTheWorldMayNeverKnow I used the 3 or 4 months free trial during the holidays then bought the family plan for $14.99 a month. 4 people in my family us it and it works great, the app could use some tweaks but it's really good overall. paev If you listen to main stream music it doesn't really matter what service to use. However, if you like something unusual, weird or other languages then Google is a way to go. I found bands on Google music that Spotify displayed as not found. Google also have new synth bands that Spotify doesn't. I'm for Google too. Daniel I discovered that GPM is kinda like a music label. I once went to a section of Google play explaining how indie artists can use GPM like a music label as long as they own all their rights. Ryne Hager Ultraista (among others) keeps me using Google Play Music as well as Spotify. Carson Saldanha Does anyone else who activated the Play Music trial have YouTube Red working as well? My YT Red doesn't seem to be enabled while my Play Music is. Michael Carr I spotted a similar offer a couple of months ago, and I took it after a day or two's thought. Just last week, I moved directly into a family plan. PewPewYoureDead It's hard to recommend Google Play Music until they revamp the UI. Margaritas Ante Porcos Google Music is the only choice in some markets, like Russia, where no Spotify or Pandora are available. There are too many shortcomings in Google Music and Google never shows interest in making services better than below average. I really wonder why Google refuses to become the best at anything. Real magic here. Pixel syndrome all the way. Yet Google Music is on my phone and I use it because there's no choice whatsoever. Rob You answered your own question. If there's no alternative, then they don't have any incentive to improve the service. SupahNin10doh Stupid Dorito logo... Raymond Berger Huh, I just subscribed to the trial but you youtube red hasn't kicked in yet. Any idea how long it takes? Iamsecond If you live in the UK, about 2 years so far h20ray Google Play Music is currently available in select territories and for select account types. Umang Ladia I'm only seeing 2 months offer in India, anybody can confirm? Mohammad Ovais Yeah, same for me. Maybe it's region limited. Isolde I think you need to open the link in a browser, if you open it in the app it's just the normal 2 months. Manoj | Blogging Triggers Is Google Music really worth to it? We have better alternatives Sathiya Moorthy Karan I came across a great post, it seems to be so cool http://developeit.net/android-news-image-scanner-finder/ Zachariah Mann It only shows up as 2 free months for me. I live in Michigan. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/a19b7e9dddb67bf897c751aedf63c01917048214140db901fd783b2182d8d5c0.png Mikael Jakobsson Should mabye joine premium at Google Music if that coste like $2 max a month dont understand why they should take as mutch as someone some has app or Win32 software to PC so music controllers one they keyboards works. Tab out frome a game for pause music when the round is over is just bad. Arif Gürü And stil isnt available on Turkey xyz "No telling how long this offer might last, so if you have been considering subscribing, now might be the time to do it." No thanks, I'll just use YouTube. Only thing YT needs is an option to play audio only so I can save a wee bit more data when I don't need video.

With its sensing, mapping, and localization capabilities, the Google Tango platform has a lot of promise for robotics. Here’s an update on some of what Google has been working on with it: And here’s the talk that Johnny Lee from the Tango project gave at Google I/O earlier this month. [ Google Tango ] Flyability’s Elios drone has the ability to fly almost anywhere thanks to the clever design of its roll cage. It’s already been deep down inside glaciers, so the next logical place to send it is a cave: Flyability took part in the scientific expedition (ref article from ESA) organized by the La Venta Association and Commissione Grotte Eugenio Boegan, together with the European Space Agency and astronaut Luca Parmitano, in the La Cucchiara caves near Sciacca, Sicily. Part of ESA’s Cooperative Adventure for Valuing and Exercising human behavior and performance Skills course (CAVES-X1), this expedition was primarily meant to train astronauts in an environment replicating extraterrestrial conditions. It has also been the opportunity to deploy Elios in extreme conditions by performing the exploration of an underground abyss. The known part of the cave consists of a gallery that ends in a 100 m deep abyss. This is as far as humans could go in the exploration and that’s where the collision-tolerant drone was used to continue the journey. With an ambient temperature of 37°C, 100% of humidity and continuous rain from condensation, the Flyability team joining the expedition operated the drone to find potential unexplored paths. Using Elios’ thermal camera to detect hidden hot air sources, the team could very quickly and clearly identify openings of various size. [ Flyability ] via [ ESA ] Thanks Adrien! You should probably not try this with your robot: [ Denso Robotics ] Evezor is a SCARA-type robot arm designed to be able to automate tasks using any tool you decide to strap to it: It’s a compelling vision, certainly, but the early bird price is over $3,000, and the project is looking for $250k. If you know this is for you, you’ll probably jump on it, but it’s a big investment for most makers. [ Evezor ] via [ BBG ] One of the desires with robotic systems is to devise easier ways to setup and program the robots. One potential approach to setup is known as “Programming by Demonstration” in which a human trainer demonstrates the task to the robot, and from that demonstration the robot learns the task which can be performed. During her summer internship at Fetch Robotics, Sarah Elliott worked on a web-based programming by demonstration system for the Fetch. [ Fetch Robotics ] Drone behemoth DJI continues to outdo itself with the launch of Spark, a very compact camera drone with a range of autonomous capabilities, including obstacle sensing, hand-gesture recognition, and pre-programmed flight behaviors like following and circling: One of the most impressive things is that you get all this for just $500. [ DJI ] Introducing Daisy, an 18-DOF hexapod walking robot built from X-Series modular actuators. This robot is now on display the the Chicago Museum of Science and Industry as part of their Robot Revolution exhibit. [ Hebi Robotics ] via [ CMU RI ] I’m not sure that I need my toy racecars to make snarky comments (I do just fine on my own, thank you very much), but the amount of sensing and actuation in Sphero’s latest toy is impressive: The car will run at up to 10 km/h, make it 40 minutes on a charge, and there are all kinds of moves and sounds that you can control with an app. But along with all of that intelligence and sensing and actuation comes a price to match: the toy is now on sale for $300. [ Sphero ] Security robots certainly have value, but the bad guys can probably outrun most of them. That’s not a problem for the O-R3, a security ground robot that can deploy an untethered drone to pursue a suspect: [ Otsaw ] via [ Engadget ] Sweep, the alarmingly affordable high quality lidar sensor from Scanse, is now available with an add-on kit that lets you take 3D scans of very large areas: The kit is $350, and the lidar itself isn’t included. But you have one on pre-order already anyway, right? [ Scanse ] Thanks Tyson! Lockheed Martin successfully launched Vector Hawk, a small, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), on command from the Marlin MK2 autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) during a cross-domain command and control event hosted by the U.S. Navy. In addition to Marlin and Vector Hawk, the Submaran, an unmanned surface vehicle (USV) developed by Ocean Aero, provided surface reconnaissance and surveillance. During the Annual Navy Technology Exercise (ANTX) activities in August, the Submaran relayed instructions to Marlin from a ground control station via underwater acoustic communications. Following these instructions, the Marlin launched the Vector Hawk using a specially-designed canister from the surface of the Narragansett Bay. Following launch, Vector Hawk successfully assumed a mission flight track. All three autonomous vehicles—Marlin, Submaran and Vector Hawk—communicated operational status to the ground control station to maintain situational awareness and provide a means to command and control all assets. The four-pound Vector Hawk can fly for 70-plus minutes, at line-of-sight ranges up to 15 kilometers. Operators can recover and re-launch the Vector Hawk in a matter of minutes (including changing the system’s battery). Vector Hawk is built on an open architecture to enable rapid technology insertion and payload integration. Marlin MK2 is a battery powered, fully autonomous underwater vehicle that is 10 feet long with a 250 pound payload capacity, 18-24 hour endurance, depth rating of 1000 feet and weighs approximately 2,000 pounds. [ Lockheed Martin ] Scientists at Scuola Sant’Anna in Italy and EPFL (Ecole polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne) in Switzerland have built a prototype of a smart, light-weight and easy-to-personalize exoskeleton that counteracts the loss of balance and promotes balance recovery after an accidental slip. This is a first in wearable machines, which are normally used to assist or enhance regular movement, instead of preventing an unexpected event like falling. [ EPFL ] The EduExo is a robotic exoskeleton kit that you assemble and program yourself. It contains the hardware that you need to build an elbow exoskeleton. An accompanying handbook contains a tutorial that will guide you through the different assembly steps. In addition, the handbook provides background information on exoskeleton history, functionality and technology. In the end, you will have a good understanding about exoskeleton technology and its application, together with hands-on experience building and programming your own robotic exoskeleton. The Kickstarter is already funded, but you can pledge $180 towards a kit, or $250 if you want a kit that includes muscle control. [ EduExo ] The Acorn team has deployed a Sawyer collaborative robot operating a band saw, where the robot transfers, aligns and cuts pieces of wood to be used as mounts for rubber stamps. Sawyer cuts, drills and inserts the wooden handles for the stamp mounts, effectively automating a complicated, multi-step process. [ Rethink Robotics ] The Office of Naval Research (ONR) TechSolutions-sponsored Mine Warfare Rapid Assessment Capability (mRAC) is a man-portable threat detection and localization system that utilizes an ultra-sensitive magnetometer sensor package installed onboard a small quadrotor platform. [ ONR ] Elad Inbar CEO & Founder of RobotLAB Inc talking with the Learning Counsel about STEM, robotics and the ways in which schools can use technology to reimagine classroom learning.

According to a report in ReCode on Friday, the US Labour Department has sued Google for salary records, arguing it is legally entitled to on grounds that Google is a government contractor. Google has been accused of "systemic compensation disparities against women pretty much across the entire workforce." The search engine giant argued in a US court that it would take 500 hours and $100,000 to fulfil the Labour Department's request. According to Google, the requests from the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP), a section of the Labour Department, were "overbroad in scope or reveal confidential data." "We've worked hard to comply with the OFCCP's current audit and have provided hundreds of thousands of records over the last year, including those related to compensation," the report quoted a Google spokesperson as saying. "However, the handful of OFCCP requests that are the subject of the complaint are overbroad in scope, or reveal confidential data, and we've made this clear to the OFCCP, to no avail." The spokesperson added that these requests include thousands of employees' private contract information which they safeguard rigorously. Refuting the claims of the Labour Department, Google claimed that its own analysis of its data showed no gender pay gap, and that its pay model prevented such discrimination. However, not all former employees agreed on this. --IANS qd/ruwa/bg SEARCH More from Sify: talking point on sify news Latest Features Three years of PR Sarkar! And the award goes to...

"We've worked hard to comply with the OFCCP's current audit and have provided hundreds of thousands of records over the last year, including those related to compensation," the report quoted a Google spokesperson as saying. "However, the handful of OFCCP requests that are the subject of the complaint are overbroad in scope, or reveal confidential data, and we've made this clear to the OFCCP, to no avail." The spokesperson added that these requests include thousands of employees' private contract information which they safeguard rigorously. Refuting the claims of the Labour Department, Google claimed that its own analysis of its data showed no gender pay gap, and that its pay model prevented such discrimination. However, not all former employees agreed on this. --IANS qd/ruwa/bg (This story has not been edited by Business Standard staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)

Google has finally introduced the Google Opinion Rewards app for the Indian market. The app is created by Google Surveys team and allows users to answer quick surveys. The app is now available in India, Singapore and Turkey. The app is available for download from Google Play Store.    The app asks for few surveys, and in turn, users get Google Play credit. The credit can then be used to buy applications or games from Google Play Store. The app is ideal for those who want to buy their favourite games but don’t want to spend real money.      The working of the application is pretty simple. Once you download the app, you need to answer some basic questions about your name, age group, gender and so on. Google will send you surveys around once a week, although it may be more or less frequent. The moment a new survey arrives, you will get a notification on your phone and can receive up to $1.00 ( approx. Rs 64) in Play credit for completing it.   Google is working hard to make the Google Play Store much safer as well. The company, during its annual developer conference, announced a new programme known as Google Play Protect, which safeguard users from malicious and dangerous apps. Play Protect will be built into every device with Google Play and automatically takes action to keep users’ data and device safe. Google says that it scans more than 50 billion apps every day, and the new feature will detect and remove apps that might be harmful.

AFL: Dreamtime at the ‘G was a highlight in its 21st instalment, with over 85,000 packing the MCG for Sir Doug Nicholls’ Indigenous round. The Tigers came out on top in what was a pulsating encounter between these two powerhouse teams. Earlier in the day, the Dees easily accounted for a disappointing Suns after the Suns started brightly in Alice Springs, while the Dogs got back on track with a comfortable win over the Saints. The night ended with a total boilover in Adelaide, with the Crows thumping the Dockers by 100 points. Super Netball: The biggest game of the day lived up to expectation, with the Lightning and Giants playing out a thriller which the Lightning won by the smallest of possible margins. It was a crucial win, which puts the Lightning in the major semi-final against the Vixens, who breezed past the West Coast Fever in the last game of the night, 68-42. Earlier, the Firebirds ended their season on a high with a win over the Swifts. Neither team, however, will play finals this year. Super Rugby: The Rebels were again disappointing, with their loss to the Crusaders compounded by their Wallaby backrower Sean McMahon appearing to break his arm. It’s now 20 matches - including this entire Super Rugby campaign - since an Australian team has beaten a team from New Zealand, heaping more misery on Australian Rugby Union. The Waratahs also lost to the Highlanders, leaving the ‘Tahs second in the Australian conference behind the Brumbies. NRL: The Sharks overran the Bulldogs in the dying minutes, while the Warriors beat a depleted Broncos earlier in the day. Shaun Johnson starred for his side, with two first-half assists and one try to go along with his four conversions. Play of the day: I liked Shai Bolton’s game-saving tackle in the dying minutes of the Dreamtime clash against the Dons. Pressure acts are chronically underrated and this one turned the match. AFL (@AFL) Here's why Tiger fans are enamored with Shai Bolton. #AFLTigersDons pic.twitter.com/wI5bpmm5lV May 27, 2017 Today’s big winners/losers: Hard to go past the Dockers as the big losers of the day. Embarrassing for Ross Lyon who usually prides himself on fielding competitive teams, win or lose. This is clearly tongue in cheek, but David Myers gets a mention for tackling his own team-mate: Andrew McCormack (@_AMcCormack) So...David Myers just tackled his own team mate #AFLTigersDons pic.twitter.com/Gt4HbNjw1s May 27, 2017 The biggest winners were likely the Lightning, with so much on the line in their clash with the Giants. Comeback of the day: Surely the late win by the Sharks over the Bulldogs. As he did for most of the game, Paul Gallen inspired with a 25-metre run in the lead-up to Chad Townsend’s 78th-minute field goal that broke the 8-8 deadlock. rugbyleaguehub.com (@leaguehubcom) #NRLcrocby The run from PaulGallen13. The extra point from chadtownsend10!#NRLSharksBulldogs#NRL pic.twitter.com/jbCbF0jBXX from NRL May 27, 2017 If today were a song: This is not in the usual spirit of this category, but today I kept thinking of Treaty, by Youth Yindi. Hard to believe the song was written in 1991, after Bob Hawke had - in 1988 - promised a treaty by 1990. This week, 27 years later, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander leaders again called for a treaty, as well as the constitutional enshrinement of Indigenous voices in parliament. The call for treaty was made in explicit comparison to the more ‘mainstream’ desire for constitutional recognition that has been featured in the AFL’s Indigenous Round (with players’ jumpers carrying the ‘Recognise’ symbol). As Calla Wahlquist writes, “the statement said that the high rates of incarceration, youth detention and child removal showed the need for a significant practical change, not a symbolic reform”. Thanks very much to everyone who joined me here on the liveblog tonight, in comments below and on Twitter- I really enjoyed your input. Looking forward to seeing you back here next time, and do join Paul Connolly at midday tomorrow for Sunday’s Australia sportwatch.

Ross Lyon has never coached a side that has lost by 100 points or more - until now. The Crouch brothers set the win up for the Crows, as did Rory Sloane. Eddie Betts was at his scintillating best, kicking three goals while Andy Otten bagged four. Ross Lyon looked to have some stern words with his players after the siren. As in the Dreamtime game, most players swapped guernseys with their opponents after the siren. Eddie Betts kicked three goals as the Crows condemned the Dockers to a three-figure loss.

Heaping more misery on the hapless Rebels, their Wallaby backrower Sean McMahon appeared to have broken his arm to end his hopes of playing in Australia’s Test series next month. McMahon was playing only his third game of the season after returning from injury but went down after making a tackle in the 73rd minute and was escorted from the field by medical staff. The loss meant it’s now 20 matches - including this entire Super Rugby campaign - since an Australian team has beaten a team from New Zealand.

They threatened to lose another tight one after failing to capitalise on the many opportunities, they created, but finally held on as the rain trickled down on the Dreamtime clash. That’s their sixth win after they started with five-straight. The Bombers will be proud of their efforts, but will surely be disappointed after such a convincing win against the Eagles last week. Nice scenes after the siren with some of the players swapping jumpers, including captains Cotchin and Heppell. Cotchin put the red and black for a moment before a club official appeared to tell him to take it off. He replaced it with a Tigers jacket. Jack Riewoldt and the Tigers will be relieved to come away with the win after three consecutive losses under a goal.

Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.25am EDT 07:25 NRL: Cronulla Sharks beat Canterbury Bulldogs 9-8 This from Wires on the last-minute win by the Sharks: A powerhouse performance from skipper Paul Gallen inspired Cronulla to a thrilling 9-8 comeback NRL win over Canterbury in front of their biggest crowd in half a decade. Gallen twice came up with critical plays to set up Saturday night’s victory, including a 25-metre run in the lead-up to Chad Townsend’s 78th-minute field goal that broke an 8-8 deadlock. The former NSW State of Origin skipper also turned the game when, with his team down by six points with 13 minutes to play, he picked up a grubber in-goal and just managed to force his way back into the field of play. With four stars away on Origin duty, Gallen - playing in his first club game during Origin since 2010 - finished with a team-high 181 metres and three tackle breaks. The win extends Cronulla’s winning streak to three and consolidates their top-four spot, while the defeat for the Bulldogs is compounded by a shoulder injury to skipper James Graham. Here’s the field goal that sealed the win for Cronulla. Unbelievable chase by Sharks captain Paul Gallen who dragged his team over the line. rugbyleaguehub.com (@leaguehubcom) #NRLcrocby The run from PaulGallen13.

The sides could barely be split all night, and scores were tied at three-quarter-time. A 15-14 final term ensured the Lightning crossed the line by the barest of margins. The win was crucial, as it means the Lightning will finish second and go into the major semi-final against the Vixens. Whoever wins the Major proceeds straight to the grand final, while the loser gets the all-important second-chance. Meanwhile the Giants will now face the Magpies in the minor semi-final. It’s a blow for the Giants, who have lost their last two games. Nonetheless, they took it up to the Lightning, with the game going down to the wire. Stephanie Wood and Caitlin Bassett dominated for the Lightning, with Wood finishing with 17/22 and Bassett with 39/41.

The 29-year-old four-time world champion broke his own lap record late in the session, clocking 1:12.395 to eclipse the time he set on Thursday by three-tenths of a second. In all, four drivers produced laps under the one minute 13 second mark but they did not include Daniel Ricciardo, whose best lap, a 1:13.392, was only good enough for sixth and almost one second off the pace of Vettel. Lewis Hamilton again struggled with his Mercedes and was only fifth fastest at the end of the session. Qualifying begins at 2:00pm on Saturday (10pm AEST).

The Tahs’ hopes of topping the Australian conference dropped on Saturday when they surrendered a 14-13 halftime lead and conceded 17-straight points after the break. The Highlanders scored six tries to four. They capitalised on a one-man advantage early in the second half, when they scored two tries while Waratahs lock Dean Mumm was in the sin-bin. Mumm, who earlier this week announced he would retire at the end of this year, was given a yellow card for a dangerous tackle, but looked a little unlucky. A converted try to replacement halfback Jake Gordon cut the deficit to nine points and lifted the Tahs in their push for a bonus point. Those were quickly extinguished with Daniel Lienert-Brown and Lima Sopoaga touching down for the home team, before Gordon scampered away after taking a quick tap to notch his second five-pointer. The loss leaves the Tahs second in the Australian conference behind the Brumbies, who can stretch that lead by beating the Jaguares on Sunday morning in Buenos Aires. Rob Thompson of the Highlanders dives over to score during the match between the Highlanders and the Waratahs at Forsyth Barr Stadium in Dunedin.

Shaun Johnson starred, with two first-half assists and one try to go along with his four conversions. For the Broncos, a pair of tries to James Roberts within ten minutes put a scare through the Warriors, but James Gavet crossed the line five minutes later to assure the Warriors of the win. The loss sees the Broncos drop from second to third, while the Warriors sit two points outside the eight, with five wins from 12 outings. Shaun Johnson was clearly best on ground against the Broncos.

In the meantime, here’s some reading material in advance of the America’s Cup. The oldest international sporting trophy (dating back to 1851), the America’s Cup is happening in Bermuda this year, and was perhaps one of the most fascinating sources of sporting news this week after claims of espionage ‘like James Bond or the CIA’ emerged. If you know little about the sport (or even if you do), it’s worth reading this feature on how cutting-edge engineering and technology is propelling the sport further into the future. The reigning champions are Oracle Team USA who have Australian Jimmy Spithill at the helm. Another Australian, Nathan Outteridge is steering the hopes of Swedish entry Artemis Racing. The winner of the Louis Vuitton (yes, you read that correctly) Cup Qualifiers will meet Defending Champions Oracle USA. Not sure if it’s just me, but the idea of being out in the water in Bermuda makes me think something extraordinary might happen. For fellow nerds out there, you might want to check out this Guardian article from last year about the ‘mystery’ of the Bermuda Triangle.

In the end it was a comfortable win over the Suns, with Melbourne now sitting at 5-4 (20 points) ahead of their bye next week.

Google announced at I/O 2017 that you can make physical photo books from the pictures you have on its Photos app. Initially users could only do it on the desktop browser. Now, Google updated the Photos app on iOS and Android to make it easier for you to make the books. The softcover 7-inch album will cost US$10 for 20 pages, while the hardcover 9-inch version will cost $20 for 20 pages. The downside is this feature is currently only available in the US and Google hasn’t made any announcements if it’ll bring it outside of the country. We’re hoping it makes its way here.

The tech billionaire's blimp, according to The Guardian, is currently under construction at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA's) Moffett Field in Santa Clara County, California. The space agency leased a hangar to Alphabet subsidiary Planetary Ventures in 2014 for $1.6bn over the course of 60 years. The helium-fed balloon behemoth will reportedly be almost 200 metres long and is expected to cost $100m to $150m. It is said to have been conceived for use with hydrogen, but evidently someone recalled the fiery fate of the Hindenburg. Moffett Field, just down the road from Google's Mountain View, California, headquarters, previously served a now-defunct commercial zeppelin business, Airship Ventures, which operated sightseeing flights from the facility between 2008 and 2012. Lack of sponsorships and a tenfold increase in the price of helium contributed to the firm's demise, according to the San Francisco Chronicle. The failed company's 75-metre airship, Eureka, has since been disassembled and shipped back to its maker, Zeppelin Luftschifftechnik GmbH, in Germany. Igor Pasternak, CEO of airship company Aeros, expressed optimism about the commercial potential of airships in a phone interview with The Register. Past airship efforts, he suggested, focused too much on niche markets. He described airships as a way to make cargo distribution direct, rather than flowing through an inefficient chain of ports and distribution points. He likened the decentralization airships can bring to the way the internet reshaped information distribution. But it may be a while before airships fill the skies. It will take more than five years, he said. "It took a long time to get from America Online to Gmail," he pointed out. Tech billionaires have shown an affinity for airy ventures. Larry Page, Alphabet's CEO and Google's other founder, owns two flying car companies, Kitty Hawk and Zee.Aero. The two startups are competing to design personal aircraft more appealing than ultralights and more affordable than private planes. Amazon's Jeff Bezos and Tesla's Elon Musk have focused their attention on rocketry, though Musk (who also has an affinity for tunneling) has expressed interest in electric planes. The general public too can look forward to personal air transport, which will probably look more like Uber's Elevate project than Brin's floating folly. But don't expect much for a decade or more, according to a paper published earlier this month by researchers at Duke University and NASA. There may be some outliers – like AeroMobil, which has begun taking pre-orders to deliver a commercially available flying car in 2017. But with a price tag of at least $1.2m, the AeroMobil flying car isn't reaching beyond the traditional private jet market. According to the paper's co-authors – Victoria Chibuogu Nneji, Alexander Stimpson, and Mary (Missy) Cummings from Duke, and Kenneth H Goodrich, from NASA Langley Research Center – the technology necessary for on-demand passenger air travel and the requisite regulatory framework won't be ready for a decade or more. As the paper recounts, prior efforts to democratize air travel have struggled with issues of cost and safety. Faced with low public interest and accidents, New York Airways, which offered helicopter transit in New York City from 1949 to 1979, couldn't make enough money to sustain operations. Then there's the Small Aircraft Transportation System (SATS), a $69m initiative between 2001 and 2005, conceived as a joint partnership between NASA and the Federal Aviation Administration to create a market for low-cost regional aviation using jets like taxis. Its impact was blunted by a decline in the number of private pilots, the limited number and locations of airports that handle general aviation, the challenge of air traffic management, and the high cost of aircraft, the paper explains.

One of the features that Google showed off during the event was called Notification Dots, which are small dots that appear on apps when you have a notification. You won’t be able to try notification dots until Android O rolls out later this year, but you can add an unofficial version of the feature to your phone right now. Don't Miss: New report reaffirms the iPhone 8’s most exciting new feature This week, the first beta for Nova Launcher 5.2 arrived on Google Play. Along with some minor fixes and performances improvements, the latest update adds customizable notification dots to the launcher. You can decide where on the app icon they will appear and how large they will be. And just like the real dots, Nova Launcher’s notification dots will match the color scheme of the app icon they appear on. It’s not an exact replica of the notification dots that will appear on Android O, but if you want to take a trial run of the new feature, this might be the best way to do so, other than downloading the Android O beta. Unfortunately, the Android beta is only available on certain phones, while Nova is universal. If you want to try out the latest version of the Nova Launcher, just opt in on Google Play and wait for the update to arrive on your phone or manually download the 5.2 beta from APKMirror.

There is now a new “Personal” tab (via Search Engine Roundtable) on the web and mobile to quickly see these results from your various Google apps, 9to5Google reports. “Personal” is the newest filter in Google Search that helps users fine-tune results by content type, like Images, News, Shopping, etc. Depending on the query, Google usually reorders the tabs to list the most relevant filters first. However, for the moment, it appears that the Personal tab is always the last item in the “More” menu. This is the case through multiple search terms that readily bring up Gmail and Calendar cards in the main “All” tab. The most common result that appears under Personal are messages from Gmail, with around 10 messages appearing in a card. Tapping one will immediately open the full message in a tab, with the option to load in Gmail. Results from Calendar and Photos work similarly, with the latter immediately opening up the image, with a “View all Google Photos results” link at the bottom of the card offering to perform a full search in Photos. Similar to the rest of Google Search, ads do appear in the Personal tab, but at the very bottom underneath cards and results on the web. The Personal tab appears to be widely rolled out, with users first seeing the filter yesterday. Available on the web and mobile, it does not appear in the Google app for Android.

[Update: False alert] Google says gifting in the Play Store is "Infeasible," marks it as "Won't Fix" in the Issue Tracker Rita El Khoury Follow View All Posts 2017/05/26 4:14am PDTMay 26, 2017 15 Plus 1 on G+ 66 Share on Facebook 44 Share on Twitter Total Shares125 Google News Update 1: 2017/05/26 5:03am PDT False alert. Issue was closed in 2013 because it was submitted to the wrong tracker. You know how almost every app or software store lets you buy apps and gift them to someone else? Well, you better put your dreams of ever doing that on Android to rest. Or burying them under 10 feet of disappointment. Someone at Google recently took a look at the Issue Tracker, saw the issue labeled "Implement Gifts within Android Market," which has been added back in 2010 when the Play Store was still the Android Market and which has gathered over 1100 stars and hundreds of comments from users requesting app gifting, and decided to be the bearer of bad news because you know what, this is "infeasible" and Google "won't fix" it. But the writing has been on the wall for a few days; we could have seen it coming if we had been playing closer attention. Credit gifting disappeared from the US Play Store on May 16, and then the support page for Google Play gift cards and promo codes was updated on May 17 to replace the "Google Play credit gifts" section with "Google Play book gifts." That change clearly shows that credit gifting was completely gone, not a glitch, and that from now on, you can only gift music and books, but definitely not credit. Above: Pre-May 17. Below: Current support page. Put 1 and 1 together and you understand that the future of gifting or buying someone credit on Google Play is grim. You better kill your dreams of purchasing apps/games for your friends or employees, gifting a niece or nephew some Play credit for new games educational apps, or encouraging your parents to use a certain app by buying it for them. I still can't wrap my head around the fact that Google, the behemoth that can make AI understand every word I say and predict the news I want to read and the traffic on my way to work, is saying that app gifting is "Infeasible" when other app stores have clearly managed to make it feasible. I'm sure there's a reason, but I can't think of any that would be unsurmountable for Google but not for others, or any that would apply to apps and games but not to books and music. The latter traditionally carry a lot more licensing and legislative limits than apps/games. As a consolation, you can turn to Google Play gift cards and Family Sharing in the countries where they're available to share or send apps and games to others. Update 1: 2017/05/26 5:03am PDT False alert. Issue was closed in 2013 because it was submitted to the wrong tracker. I apologize for the false alert. It looks like the issue was actually marked as "Infeasible" back in 2013 because it was posted to the wrong issue tracker and couldn't be fixed by the AOSP team but had to be submitted to the Google Product Forums instead. The issue has just picked up a lot of comments recently, which brought it to the attention of our tipster and thus our inbox, and with the recent disappearance of the Play credit gifting option, we incorrectly assumed there was a link there. What remains true though is that credit gifting is completely gone and you can only send music and books now. There's no proof that app/game gifting wouldn't make an appearance at some point, so I suppose there's a silver lining somewhere.

Rita El Khoury Yup, as shown in the screenshots, Books and Music gifting is available. But credit buying for others or gifting apps/games is now a dead dream. FaultException It was marked infeasible because it was on the wrong issue tracker, and it was back in 2013, not recently at all. See comment #108 on the issue where it was marked. Suicide_Note Not a big deal, really. demarcmj Agree. Low tech is better... https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/276e854598d2a91aa3a795a84e4ecbec4f4f587c8e3da3c55b968c90ad4ec402.jpg Kristian Ivanov https://gfycat.com/RevolvingEdibleCivet h4rr4r Totally wrong article actually. This issue tracker is not for the play store. Thomas Gladdines If I ever had to implement gifting apps I would make it an in app purchase and then simply show a 100% off coupon.

Nicholas Conrad Witty comment status: won't fix. Kristian Ivanov It was going to be awesome though, it involved old people, polar bears and a skateboard...oh well, at some point in the future when this is in the news again I'll post it :c Daniel But there's a good reason for it, it's not just that Google is evil: https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/36916787#comment108 Status: Won't Fix (Infeasible) This report applies to a mobile Google application or service, and the issue tracker where you reported it specializes in issues within the Open Source source code of the Android platform. We are not able to provide support for Google products in this issue tracker. Please report this issue in the appropriate Google Product Forum at https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!forum/en/ God of chaos It all makes sense now! demarcmj Reading!?! What is this sorcery? Rita El Khoury Ugh... My ctrl+F skills failed me, I admit. Also my little knowledge of how the Issue Tracker works. I could see when or why it was marked as Infeasible so I incorrectly assumed it was now, when the comments flared up again. Nicholas Conrad Don't get down on yourself Rita, we all have days like this at work. Even knowing the premise of the article was mistaken, I'd rather read it again than another JRE video summary article. Rita El Khoury Thanks... I guess?! demarcmj The issue tracker is partly at fault. If you hover over the resolution in that side panel, the mouse turns to the finger like it's a link... but clicking on it doesn't do anything. You would think it would take you to the resolution post for more details. But nope. Rita El Khoury Exactly. I was thinking there's something wrong with Chrome or my connection and restarted it, but clicking wouldn't take me anywhere, so I was like... well, seems like this doesn't show an explanation. demarcmj Doesn't work in Firefox or IE either (haven't tried it in Edge, or whatever they're calling the Windows 10 browser). Do they have an issue tracker for the issue tracker? Mark R. Andrachek, Jr. No. But they might have a product forum. Which nobody at google will ever check, and some "community volunteer" will suggest your reboot your PC. Rita El Khoury Arghhhhh... You're right. Many of us here at AndroidPolice looked at this and we failed to see that it was marked as Infeasible in 2013. I'll edit the post to ad that info. In our defense, many of us at AP looked at this tip and thought the status change was new, especially with the way comments were flaring up on it in the past day and with all the changes to Google Play credit gifting. Daniel No problem! :) Thanks for adding the info FaultException It wasn't marked as infeasble recently, it was marked in 2013, because it's the wrong forum (the tracker is for AOSP/Android itself) See comment #108: https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/36916787#comment108 demarcmj Yup... and most of the comments since then are people bickering about not wanting to receive emails every time someone comments on the issue. Real productive thread they have going on over there [eyeroll] Zomby2D I'm guilty of contributing to the email pollution. I had the issue starred but I haven't been getting email notifications for the longest time from this. I don't even remember noticing that it had been closed all that time ago. I just started receiving notifications again last week and figured that the ticket being closed was the reason why people were suddenly complaining. Having the reason for closing it lost in the sea of comments didn't help. Rita El Khoury Right. Fixing the post to reflect that. Dennis Ulijn I can also see the fact that people buy 100 apps with a stolen credit card and sell them on the black market, like G2A or G2play. You talk about a lot of other stores doing this already, but the uplay and steam store have had a lot of problems with this and still have those problems, without a good way to combat it. Besides that, how will you solve the VAT system? Who pays? I can see how a lot of people want it, and of course i don't mind having the possibility, but there are more problems than 'just implement it'. Carson Saldanha I think it's due to security reasons but that sucks... h4rr4r Read the update! couldn't be fixed by the AOSP team but had to be submitted to the Google Product Forums instead. h4rr4r Good retraction, update! Rita El Khoury "because it was posted to the wrong issue tracker and couldn't be fixed by the AOSP team but had to be submitted to the Google Product Forums instead." Isn't that enough of an explanation? h4rr4r I was at first talking about just the update line. But on reading the full explanation I thought it was pretty good. Ideally the update line at the top would say something about why not when. Rita El Khoury That's an automatically truncated blurb that our WordPress theme does at the top. I'll manually change it to clarify that in a bit, I was just in a rush to update the post before we got more comments telling us how wrong we were. h4rr4r YAY! krazyfrog Apple has had App Store gifting for all content since years now and somehow it's "infeasible" for Google. 🙄 Rita El Khoury Refresh your page ;) Peter World Citizen I had seen people got fired for lesser mistakes. ;) Rita El Khoury We'd be firing half the AP team and Artem. Many of us looked at this and didn't notice. Guess the post I/O haziness hasn't dissipated yet. Mark R. Andrachek, Jr. Google's Issue Tracker recently got a re-vamp. They can control, I'm sure, what the closed states are for things in their own tracker. They really need to have a closed/won't fix state that indicates that the issue has been raised in the wrong venue going forward, if they want to keep the issue tracker limited to just AOSP. These kind of things keep coming up in the AOSP issue tracker and _will continue_ to come up in the AOSP tracker if nothing changes. They don't expose issue tracking for anything else. Finding these product forums at all, much less the right one, is an exercise in madness. And then when you do find them, they're typically staffed by unpaid community volunteers. Chances are high that nobody from Google will actually see your issue, much less respond. It's like shouting into the void. Funem They should just make it so you can purchase an item, then chose to install it or create a sort of promo code which you can then just give to someone to use. They could tie it in to the promo code system they have now. Until its claimed you could still retain the option to install it by using the code yourself. prwnd Dear Community, I suggested this and I apologise because I did not find it was changed in 2013.

At Google I/O 2017, a number of new features were announced for Photos, including suggested sharing based on who's in a certain photo. But for that to work, Google needs to figure out who is who, and now the Photos web app is asking users to identify what they look like. Upon visiting photos.google.com, you may be welcomed by the above screen. Google already uses machine learning wizardry to match faces to people, so all you have to do is select which face is yours. Once you do that, you'll be able to search for "me" in the Photos search to find pictures of yourself. According to a recent teardown, this option should appear at some point in the Photos app as well, but it didn't for me. Presumably, this will be far more useful once the other features announced at Google I/O show up. Let us know in the comments if you have received the pop-up.

I got the pop up just the other day. I can search for "me" in addition to others such as my daughter's name. John Doe I did but for some reason it shows a photo of me from over 6 years ago even though I have plenty of recent photos LoL Corbin Davenport Yep, my picture was an awful photo of me from several years ago. John Doe I was able to change it by going to people then clicking on the picture and even when you choose a picture with a lot of people in it figures out which one is you and zooms in...creepy bozzykid It doesn't matter what photo you choose of yourself. The rest are all linked to you anyways. This isn't replacing your profile pic. John Doe No but some photos it has not figured out its me or at least when I click on me it doesn't show all the pictures of me but it is good enough to find pictures of me when I was a child which is crazy because I changed a lot. Stakoman Is this US only? would be great if you guys made a "how to enable face recognition google photos" post Suicide_Note Use a US VPN to start using the face recognition. Once you get things setup, you can stop using the VPN, though face recognition should still work. rndusrnm479461 You can use a VPN (get tunnelbear cause it's free) for Android, then clear cache, open photos and enable grouping of faces in the settings. Then you can disable VPN. I did this about a year ago and I've had it ever since without any problem both on Android and on the web. bozzykid I believe it uses one of the firsts photos you have stored. It has already linked the rest to you anyways. Régis Knechtel Not always, apparently, cause it used a recent photo for me. I think it's random. Brendapdaniels Google is paying 97$ per hour!

LightofHonor Has been there for me for awhile. Useful since I can search multiple names and it shows all the pictures with those people in it. Defenestratus No. Régis Knechtel "his option should appear at some point in the Photos app as well" It asked to chose my face me today in the android app, while I was setting up a new phone. jcopernicus I accidentally closed the prompt...how to I get it back? Corbin Davenport On the web, go to Settings -> Group similar faces, and there should be an option to pick your face. Yatin No, I'm from India Drakenoid Yes, I'm also from India. Naga Sridhar I am from India too, but are you in India? myssi Pop-up recieved, I'm from Pakistan. Tomáš Petrík And I guess we will be left out in the EU, again :/ Indefinite Implosion I'm in NL and got it a few days ago? A day or two after the announcement maybe (crunch time, so days are a blur). I didn't tip because it doesn't do anything right now so hardly seems worthy of a post. roberto.elena Do you already have "group similar faces" activated? If yes, then you will get this update. Tomáš Petrík No, it is disabled for accounts registered in the EU due to some stupid privacy ruling of the EU. roberto.elena I know, but you can activate it using a VPN (or at least that was possible when they launched Google Photos). Once it's activated, you don't need the VPN anymore, and you get all updates related to face recognition features. Nelson Not correct. I'm in Europe and by using Opera VPN plus Google Photos cache clear the feature appeared Amir Instead of copying and pasting your Debbie Downer response on every single comment, go try it with a VPN. Gosh! Suicide_Note Use a US VPN and you can join the party. Tomáš Petrík It's not about VPN this time. Accounts registered in the EU have facial recognition disabled due to some stupid privacy ruling of the EU. Jens Törnblad That's why you activate the feature with a VPN. Suicide_Note Ah, okay. I wasn't aware of that. Definitely sucks. Mr K Nope. I cleaned data from Google Photos and force closed, activated Tunnelbear (it's free for 500MB but you won't use more than 50) in the US and opened Photos. Configured everything (make sure face recognition" is activated in settings) and everything works fine. I just got the notification in Photos for web about this new feature. And you can of course uninstall the VPN when everything is set up. rndusrnm479461 Get tunnelbear for Android. Choose a US vpn. Clear Google Photos cache -> open it -> enable grouping of faces in the settings. You only have to do this once. I did it a year ago and it has worked ever since on all my devices. Tomáš Petrík It's not about VPN this time, though. Accounts registered in the EU have facial recognition disabled due to some stupid privacy ruling of the EU. rndusrnm479461 Really? I registered mine in EU in ~2008 and activated face grouping in early 2016 without problems. henleyb I got it a day or two ago. Was an old photo but searching for 'me' did bring up correct photos for me so that's something. Looking forward to the sharing stuff next. :) Suicide_Note Haven't seen this popup yet, but on a related note, photo books have gone live for me in the Photos app. Taylor Hardy I work from ease of my residence, with the help of easy jobs that merely usually requires from you a Computer system and even on-line connection and I am also more successful than ever before...

I immediately went to my S7 to see did I have it and nothing. Joao Letelier Ummm... I have been able to search for "me" since last year on the photos app on my phone. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/6ec05347bcd3f095b697a97df58508cf28a8d34b7fc289baa308796bc81cf2b3.jpg Deeco Skynet. slowly, but surely...

As you can see, the new tool enables you to create a GIF using any data points – Google suggests you can use Google Trends data, but the actual input is manual, so you can use any data you want. You fill in the relevant fields, select the colors for each point, enter in a title, then press ‘Launch Comparisons’ and you'll get a sample of your new GIF, like this. The GIF option provides you with an interesting way to present relevant data – you have to experiment with it a bit to get it exactly how you’d like (note the full title is cut off in the Twitter listing in my example), but it’s an interesting option, especially for those looking for new ways to highlight such insights. As you may have noticed, content creators love to add in Google Trends data to underpin their points - though it can sometimes lead to come misleading stats. Here’s an example (as highlighted by Danny Page in his excellent Medium post on the subject), when the Brexit vote was completed, and the subsequent confusion was in full swing, Google Trends published this tweet: "What is the EU?" is the second top UK question on the EU since the #EURefResults were officially announced pic.twitter.com/1q4VAX3qcm — GoogleTrends (@GoogleTrends) June 24, 2016 Which lead to this article in The Washington Post. But as Page points out, their definition of ‘frantic’ may not quite be accurate – when you put that increased search volume in context, matched against other trends, you can see that while the volume had increased, it wasn't getting massive attention. As such, it’s important to put the data in context – but when used well, Google Trends can provide some great visualizations and data accompaniments, which is what Google’s looking to help boost with their new data tool. GIFs can also help boost content engagement – on Twitter, for example, Tweets with GIFs generate 6X more engagement than basic text updates. It’s a small addition, sure, but an interesting one – an easy to use data visualization tools which you can use in your content.  Author Information Andrew Hutchinson @adhutchinson Sign up for the Social Media Today newsletter You'll get a daily email with the latest news, lessons, and insights on: Social Media Marketing Digital Strategy and more Yes, I'd like to receive Marketing Dive's daily newsletter as well.

[Update: Now $75 Off] Deal Alert: Pixel 32GB (international version) is $50 off on eBay Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/05/26 2:20pm PDTMay 26, 2017 2 Plus 1 on G+ 42 Share on Facebook 56 Share on Twitter Total Shares100 Deals News Pixel Update 1: 2017/05/26 2:32pm PDT It looks like the price has dropped another $25, making this a $75 savings in total. For a device that hasn't seen much in the way of price drops or It's no secret that Google has had some serious supply issues with its flagship Pixel phone. That goes for pretty much any combination of size, color, or storage. Rumors even began to surface alleging that Google had stopped production of the devices altogether. That wasn't the case, but nonetheless, you will still struggle to actually find the Pixel if you wish to buy it. A 32GB Pixel (international version) on eBay for $50 off the list price could be the answer to that problem. This is the entry level 5" Pixel, with 32GB of storage in the color Very Silver - and it's available for $599. That's $50 less than the $649 Google is still charging for it. Beware though, this is the international version of the device. So if you live in the US you'll have to check the bands to see if it works on your network. This version won't play nice with Verizon or Sprint, so if you're on either of those carriers you can rule this out. If you live outside the US then this is definitely for you. Shipping appears to be free in the US, but here in the UK, it's $18.99. That still works out a bargain for me, especially if you account for the exchange rate. You'll have to do the sums from where you are to see if the deal is as good for you. It's worth mentioning that getting your warranty honored might be tough with this type of purchase, so bear that in mind. It's hard to say how many of these they have, other than a "limited quantity," so you'll have to be quick if you want to get your hands on arguably the best Android phone of 2016. Update 1: 2017/05/26 2:32pm PDT It looks like the price has dropped another $25, making this a $75 savings in total. For a device that hasn't seen much in the way of price drops or sales since launch, $75 off isn't bad. Anyone interested in a Pixel that uses a network compatible with this international model should give it a serious think.

It doesnt matter how 'high end' a device is, if it doesn't work properly, its worthless. jonzey231 $50 is worth a guarantee that Google will honor the warranty....trust me...I wish I would've gotten my 6P direct. Andy What do you mean? jonzey231 If you don't buy the phone from Google, they won't help you. They send you to the manufacturer. I was forced to go to Huawei for my 6P and it was a little over 3 weeks before I got it back....and the problem is still there. Spend the extra $50 and buy it through Google so you're guaranteed to get support through their CS channels. You'll be glad you did in 6 months when something inevitably goes wrong. IMHO get the OnePlus 3T. Costs less but has better overall specs aside from the camera which is still pretty good in its own right. My brother has one and my roommate just got his last week and they both have no intention of going back to a major brand ever again. YaKillaCJ Same happened when I got the OnePlus One. It changed the way I (and many others) view a "budget" device from an unknown brand. needa I felt the same way after using an OPO for nearly three years. Got me an XL in mint condition for $450. Google edition even. Still had 3520 mAh in the batt too. Would have bought the black 3T had they been in stock. Took me three days to hunt down this deal. Andy Got my wife the pixel. Runs great. Just had the microphone problem. Google swapped without question. Wife seems to think it takes horrible selfies. Rod Weird, as it's cameras are regarded among the best currently. Random! @andy maybe you should let her know that the camera isn't the problem... It's actually her face. If you do warn her about this, I promise to visit you at the hospital. Andy Thanks for the tip. VAVAMk_2 Huzzah! Master Yates Agreed with you regarding the 3T. Lets see if the excellent updates and support evaporate when the One Plus 5 is released? That's the real test. IcerC Except in this case Google is the Manufacturer, that might change things. VAVAMk_2 Google didn't make the camera. Uses a Sony made sensor but the camera software is Google's and regarded among the best in post processing, particularly HDR. Roy Ahh so nice call me when the 1+2 will get Nougat and your friend will get or never get Android O. ddevito #Fail Andy S8 release response? AdMoc Does not ship to Poland as fck always -_- Random! Look for some service like Shipito. I believe they have an EU warehouse. Shakil Shaikh $60 shipping? kristin ANY Pixel made by google is compatible with any provider. It doesnt matter if its international or not. This writer is an odiot. Scott Scrivens https://www.techwalls.com/google-pixel-pixel-xl-model-number-differences/ Kevin Davis "Odiot", lmao. 😂 Oh, and you're wrong, too. kristin I called google about this. It would be up your phone company provider whether it worked or not. So it may not work with att or tmobile either. kristin This may or may not work on any provider. Its up to the provider. You want a pixel? Go to swappa.com and get one used in mint condition for much cheaper. Ive gotten a few phones from them since ive been on project fi and had no issues. Ill never buy a new phone again. Random! $50 off? How cute... If they get to $300 off ($350 final price) within a month, I might even convince myself it's worth to stare at those bezels everyday. Other than that (impossible) scenario, I'd rather get the 3T, Axon 7, or even the LG G5. Gjorgi Lazarovski The Pixel is probably not dropping in price anytime soon. iKon The most overrated smartphone of 2016. Only the camera is decent. Ugly ass design, overpriced and dull with no features compared to competition Roy You mean the best smartphone of 2016, best camera rare band front, best software, best updates. Great battery, great display. xyz No, he means "The most overrated smartphone of 2016. Only the camera is decent. Ugly ass design, overpriced and dull with no features compared to competition." Roy No, I'm sure he/she means "the best smartphone of 2016, best camera rare band front, best software, best updates. Great battery, great display". iKon No I meant what I said. The pixel is a flop and even Google knows it. No matter how much money they put into advertising there are alot of better choices out there.. only hard core Google fanboys try and big it up Roy Yes yada yada and still every reviewer said is the best smartphone of 2016. So.. even David here. In the on of the day it's a lots about the UI and I just don't like Samsung software. Ordeith LOL. You're such a Google sycophant, Roy. Roy You feeling really smart? I'm Imagine your ass all over your face. nirmitlamed Google is so off track in figuring out what customers wants and competing against the other monstrous companies. I would very much like to hear how many Pixels Google sold in the last year since they told us they sold more than they expected. Lawrence I can put my coffee cup on the Bezel David Nowicki I'm a big Nexus fan, but why would you pay $749 for the Pixel XL vs the OnePlus 3T at about half the price ? And soon the OnePlus 5 at $450 or so with S8+ specs will be a steal compared to the Pixel 4Ui812 Supply and demand. Limit the supply and you increase demand. It's like P.T. Barnum said , "There's a sucker born every minute".

By: Bloomberg | Published:May 27, 2017 1:02 pm Apple is working on a processor devoted specifically to AI-related tasks, according to a person familiar with the matter. Apple Inc. got an early start in artificial intelligence software with the 2011 introduction of Siri, a tool that lets users operate their smartphones with voice commands. Now the electronics giant is bringing artificial intelligence to chips. Apple is working on a processor devoted specifically to AI-related tasks, according to a person familiar with the matter. The chip, known internally as the Apple Neural Engine, would improve the way the company’s devices handle tasks that would otherwise require human intelligence — such as facial recognition and speech recognition, said the person, who requested anonymity discussing a product that hasn’t been made public. Apple declined to comment. Engineers at Apple are racing to catch their peers at Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc. in the booming field of artificial intelligence. While Siri gave Apple an early advantage in voice-recognition, competitors have since been more aggressive in deploying AI across their product lines, including Amazon’s Echo and Google’s Home digital assistants. An AI-enabled processor would help Cupertino, California-based Apple integrate more advanced capabilities into devices, particularly cars that drive themselves and gadgets that run augmented reality, the technology that superimposes graphics and other information onto a person’s view of the world. “Two of the areas that Apple is betting its future on require AI,” said Gene Munster, former Apple analyst and co-founder of venture capital firm Loup Ventures. “At the core of augmented reality and self-driving cars is artificial intelligence.” Improved Performance Apple devices currently handle complex artificial intelligence processes with two different chips: the main processor and the graphics chip. The new chip would let Apple offload those tasks onto a dedicated module designed specifically for demanding artificial intelligence processing, allowing Apple to improve battery performance. Should Apple bring the chip out of testing and development, it would follow other semiconductor makers that have already introduced dedicated AI chips. Qualcomm Inc.’s latest Snapdragon chip for smartphones has a module for handling artificial intelligence tasks, while Google announced its first chip, called the Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), in 2016. That chip worked in Google’s data centers to power search results and image-recognition. At its I/O conference this year, Google announced a new version that will be available to clients of its cloud business. Nvidia Corp. also sells a similar chip to cloud customers. The Apple AI chip is designed to make significant improvements to Apple’s hardware over time, and the company plans to eventually integrate the chip into many of its devices, including the iPhone and iPad, according to the person with knowledge of the matter. Apple has tested prototypes of future iPhones with the chip, the person said, adding that it’s unclear if the component will be ready this year. Apple’s operating systems and software features would integrate with devices that include the chip. For example, Apple has considered offloading facial recognition in the photos application, some parts of speech recognition, and the iPhone’s predictive keyboard to the chip, the person said. Apple also plans to offer developer access to the chip so third-party apps can also offload artificial intelligence-related tasks, the person said. Developer Conference Apple may choose to discuss some of its latest advancements in AI at its annual developer’s conference in June. At the same conference, Apple plans to introduce iOS 11, its new operating system for iPhones and iPads, with an updated user-interface, people with knowledge of the matter said last month. The company is also said to discuss updated laptops with faster chips from Intel Corp. An AI chip would join a growing list of processors that Apple has created in-house. The company began designing its own main processors for the iPhone and iPad in 2010 with the A4 chip. It has since released dedicated processors to power the Apple Watch, the motion sensors across its products, the wireless components inside of its AirPods, and the fingerprint scanner in the MacBook Pro. The company has also tested a chip to run the low-power mode on Mac laptops. In 2015, Bloomberg reported that Apple’s culture of secrecy stymied the iPhone maker’s ability to attract top AI research talent. Since then, Apple has acquired multiple companies with deep ties to artificial intelligence, has begun publishing papers related to AI research, has joined a key research group and has made hires from the field. In October 2016, Apple hired Russ Salakhutdinov from Carnegie Mellon University as its director of AI research.

Even today the first generation TPUs beat anything commercially available. But Google now has generation 2 which is just miles ahead of anything else. A TPU pod is able to generate 11.5 peta flops of fp16. No that is NOT a typo. But the key is Google is doing it on a small fraction of the power of any compe or. So Google inference per joule is a tiny fraction of someone like Nvidia. Smart move on Apple to try to copy Google and create something similar. Google shared the details of their generation 1 in a paper that Apple could then just use to build theirs.

But with the profusion of technology, information, websites, apps, and work pressure, staying focused and organized is becoming difficult. To put all the right numbers at the right place, one has to dig through messy spreadsheets or log in to different accounts in the search for your data. There are a lot of distractions out there that are all contending for your attention. With so many distractions, it is easy to get scattered. Everyone wants to get more done in less time, and luckily we have technology tacked to our hands. Over the last five years, smartphones and tablets has helped the masses with banking, social networks, grocery shopping, dating, and pretty much anything you can think of. And do you know what? They can also help you get productive. Here are seven apps that will increase your productivity, help you achieve more, and keep you on track: 1. Wunderlist Compatibility: Web, iOS and Android Cost: Free Wunderlist is an amazing app to manage every area of your life. It is free and extremely easy to use. You can make as many separate lists as you want, and file them according to your ease. The reason why Wunderlist stands out from the crowd is because it allows you to access your lists from any device and anywhere. Once you are signed up, any lists you create are saved in the cloud. You can make a list on your desktop at lunchtime and access it in your phone when you get to the supermarket in the evening. How cool is that? 2. Highrise Compatibility: Web, iOS and Android Cost: Free Highrise is a CRM app that helps you manage your tasks and goals as well as of your team members effectively. This app integrates well with all of your email accounts and calendars, keeping track of all your proposals and leads. The most amazing feature is the ability to link photos to client's profile as well as any Twitter or LinkedIn accounts they may have - it enables quick and easy grouping of contacts. Although, the basic plan is free; there are paid plans which allows you to add more users, extra contacts to your account and increased storage. 3. TickTick Compatibility: Web, iOS and Android Cost: Free TickTick is a cross-platform task management tool that supports repeating tasks, calendar subscription, and shared lists. It provides Gmail integration through which you can easily convert an email into a to-do list with Chrome extension. It allows you to set multi-level priorities for the items in your to-do list and helps you customize notifications so that you can receive reminders to meet deadlines. Another striking feature of TickTick is the knack for sending location-based reminders which can be configured when you leave or arrive at a specific location. 4. Google Keep Compatibility: Web, iOS and Android Cost: Free Google Keep offers a range of tools for taking notes, including lists, text, audio, and images. It enables you to capture quickly what is on your mind and remind you later when required. Through Keep, you can attach photos to your lists, notes and also record a voice memo that gets transcribed. The most interesting feature of Google Keep is the ability to color code the notes enabling you to organize them effectively. Other features are universal device access, the option to turn photos into text through optical character recognition and native integration with other Google devices. 5. Buffer Compatibility: Web, iOS and Android Cost: Free Buffer is a smart social media tool which helps you share and schedule posts to Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Google+, Pinterest and LinkedIn - all from one place. You will get analytics for each update you share: clicks, retweets, likes, shares, repins, mentions and more. Say you found 2 great articles and 5 images you want to share. If you post them in a row, you might flood your followers and friends who are online - and totally miss those who aren't. Instead, add these posts to Buffer and receive great social updates for the next few days. It allows you to customize schedule or 'post now' for specific events or campaigns without worrying about setting a time and date. Just hit "Buffer" and you are all set! 6. RescueTime Compatibility: Web, iOS, Android Cost: Free for Lite, Paid for premium RescueTime is a time-management app that tracks time spent on applications and websites and gives you an accurate picture of your day.

It also shows you the history productivity reports to see your progress and highlight achievements. 7. Evernote Compatibility: Web, iOS, Android Cost: Free for Basic, Paid for premium Evernote is a to-do list app which helps you stay organized about your personal and professional projects in a daily schedule. It allows you to take notes, create to-do lists, record voice reminders, take pictures, and save things you find online. The coolest feature is the ability to record and take notes at the same time. The app is free, but also has pricing plans. By taking a premium plan, you can have access to more features such as: working offline, added security, creating videos with a full screen layout, and sharing and editing your notes between your team members which makes it easier to work together and collaborate on projects. Procrastinating is a tough wall to break. To replace this bad habit, here are some hacks that can really help you to boost your productivity: - Set a timetable for your tasks: Set up all your tools, emails, browser tabs, coffee, internet etc. and yes a small break time. - Whichever task you are dreading the most is perhaps the one you need to complete at first in the morning. Set a specific time to get the things done in a stipulated time frame. - Social media platforms occupy a major part in our everyday lives and at the same time create distractions with our work. Just turn off your phone notifications or you can check these in your break time. - Keep your goals in sight all the time especially when you're working. When you see your goals many times throughout the day, your motivation level will be up to get things done effectively. - Apply two-minute rule to your life. If any task takes less than two minute, then do it now. This rule gives you a sense of satisfaction as well as fuels your productivity. - Set deadlines for your tasks as they are one of the best hacks to get the things done. Setting a finish time helps you do the task more effectively and efficiently. - Take sleep of 7-8 hours and wake up fresh every day. Technology in itself is a great cause of distraction, but also a great way to combat those distractions. All in all, use these apps and hacks to manage your time, eliminating distractions, and strengthen your mind against the affinity to procrastinate.

By: Bloomberg | Published: May 27, 2017 12:37 PM Theresa May, who is leaving the summit a day early to return to London, led the push for the changes in the wake of the bombing.(Reuters) Group of Seven leaders meeting in Sicily on Friday called on Google Inc., Facebook Inc. and other internet companies to do “substantially” more to take extremist material offline. The gathering comes just four days after a suicide bomber killed 22 people in Manchester, an attack “that demonstrates that we must now redouble our efforts,” the leaders said in a statement after the first day of talks. They pledged to tackle the risk posed by fighters as they disperse from the battlefields of Syria, Libya and elsewhere. The show of unity comes as the U.K. is still on the highest alert for further terrorist attacks, with thousands of troops taking to the streets to help keep the public safe. U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May, who is leaving the summit a day early to return to London, led the push for the changes in the wake of the bombing. You may also like to watch: “Against the backdrop of Monday’s cowardly attack in Manchester, we have discussed what more we can do together to address the threat from terror,” May said. “Make no mistake, the fight is moving from the battlefield to the internet.” May had pushed for a statement that would urge companies to develop tools to automatically identify material based on what it contains and who has posted it — and help the authorities identify and catch extremists. “While being one of the most important technological achievements in the last decades, the Internet has also proven to be a powerful tool for terrorist purposes,” the G-7 leaders said in a statement. The called on internet service providers and social media companies “to substantially increase their efforts to address terrorist content.” The G-7 leaders also pledged to help create an industry-led forum to work together on the issues. Speaking to reporters, May said that G-7 ministers would soon meet on the issue. “That is a big step forward,” May told reporters. “We have put our full weight behind the creation of this.” No Comments.

lifehacker Deadspin Fusion Gizmodo Jalopnik Jezebel Kotaku Lifehacker The Root Video Skillet Two Cents Vitals Ditch Apple's Default Keyboard for One of These Alternatives Patrick Lucas AustinFriday 6:00pm Filed to: iPhone Android Keyboards Utilities 62 5 Edit Promote Share to Kinja Toggle Conversation tools Go to permalink Image credit: John Moore/Getty In terms of functionality, Apple’s generic, preloaded keyboard has certainly improved, but even after adding its own App Store, complete with stickers and apps, it’s still a little bland. What I do love about Apple is its support for third-party keyboards. You can ditch the generic offering and download enough keyboards for every conceivable customization option you want. Keep in mind you don’t have to commit. Don’t be afraid to install more than one keyboard! If I’m looking for some particular animated image I’ll use GIPHY Keys more than Gboard, but during normal texting hours or when typing in a note-taking app like Bear, swipe-friendly keyboards are my tool of choice. Gboard (Android, iOS) Google’s keyboard (available for iOS and Android) is packed with just enough features to be useful but not too many to be cumbersome or unwieldy. It’s been my keyboard of choice since its debut, thanks to its simple search integration: In true Google fashion, you can search from the keyboard itself and send links as well as descriptive cards to recipients. Its responsive swipe functionality is great for popping in and out where other keyboards I’ve tried in the past were somewhat sluggish in acknowledging my swiping as spelling. Advertisement You can pull images and GIFs from Gboard to send or save (though the results sometimes differ between its desktop and Gboard searches). Sure, you can type on it like a traditional keyboard, but Gboard also features glide typing—swiping your finger across letters to spell words—just like Swype and Swiftkey, and it learns from your history to improve its predictive search and text suggestion without transmitting personal data to the company. If you’re on a bigger phone, the combination of glide typing and a one-handed typing setting on Gboard is a godsend, and makes texting easier and less stressful on your weak human form. Like talking to your phone? Gboard supports text dictation just like Apple’s keyboard. Gboard for Android packs in a few more extra features than its iOS counterpart, including language auto-detection complete with autocorrect and suggested text, as well as live translation. Word Flow (iOS) Made by a team in Microsoft’s experimental Garage division, Word Flow’s easy one-handed use lets me knock some text off even while straphanging. Its standout feature is its curved keyboard mode: the keyboard sits in the corner of your screen and makes it easy for your thumb to reach every letter. You can even glide type while it’s curved, and see its suggested text (though the curvature reduces the selection choice list). The built-in web search powered by Bing lets you copy and paste images and GIFs, too. If you’re suffering from thumb trouble during your typing sessions or just want to be able to reach your keys without two hands, then this is definitely a keyboard to test. 60 Essential Keyboard Shortcuts Every Office Worker Should Know Of course, you may not need all 60 of these, but knowing them will make you flexible, fast, and…Read more Swiftkey (Android, iOS) With SwiftKey, Microsoft now has two different keyboards in Apple’s app store. Swiftkey just got a much-needed redesign and with it a more minimal, functional look. It’s also more responsive than before, registering swipes quickly enough. It supports swipe typing like Gboard and Word Flow, and custom themes in case you want to add colors to your keycaps. Advertisement Sponsored Hooking Swiftkey up to your Facebook or Google account gives it access to your data (it’s encrypted before leaving your device, and Swiftkey doesn’t have your login information) that it uses to personalize your autocorrect functionality as well as predictive text suggestions. It will even show you how it’s adjusting your typing style and how much time you’re saving by not tapping away at letters. It’s got a few tricks up its sleeve if you’re looking to expand your language options—a recent update boosted support to over 100 languages. GIPHY Keys (iOS) I like GIFs. You like GIFs. We all like GIFs. Why not use a GIF-friendly keyboard? In terms of typing, you won’t find anything revolutionary here. You’ll be tapping away just like before. Giphy Keys isn’t as full-featured as Gboard, nor does it feature glide typing functionality like Swype. It’s cute, though—and it blows the competition out of the water in terms of GIF search functionality. Giphy is the gold standard of GIF integration across the web, especially since it lets you access the Betaworks company’s repository of both pop culture and original GIF content through its slew of categories—or you can search them yourself from the keyboard.

Google is now offering four free months of Google Play Music for new subscribers Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/26 2:17pm PDTMay 26, 2017 70 Plus 1 on G+ 511 Share on Facebook 83 Share on Twitter Total Shares664 Google News Right now it looks like Google is running a special offer for Google Play Music. New subscribers that sign up here can get four free months of service instead of the usual three. No telling how long this offer might last, so if you have been considering subscribing, now might be the time to do it. It could save you an extra $10. Again, this particular offer is only for new subscribers. I've been a fan of Play Music for a long time, though the device removal limit does get in the way when you switch between devices and ROMs as often as I do. Being able to mix your own library with those of a service also comes in handy. That way I can continue to support artists I am passionate about, without eschewing the larger selection of a subscription offering for the purposes of content discovery, all while being able to fill the gaps in that library. There are a lot of different music services out there, but if you're interested combining your curated library with music available via a subscription, then your options are limited. Spotify does allow you to play back locally stored files, which is convenient, but it isn't quite the same. Amazon also allows you to upload your music for playback via Amazon Music, and with Amazon Prime membership, you get a small library of streaming music to go along with that. For $10 a month ($8 for Prime members) you can access their full library as well. But, Google Play Music has a great interface and plugs nicely into all the other Google services we love. Maybe with this new offer, it's time you gave Google Play Music a chance? After all, even if it doesn't end up working out, you still got four free months of music out of the deal.

Carson Saldanha Wait, wdym 3 different countries? Did you share it with others or something? Ailín Ó’S I live in Ireland, so that's my main account. I have a secondary account based in England as part of a mail forwarder service I use, and my bf is Greek so I had him check the code on his account :) Carson Saldanha Oh wow! Carson Saldanha Hey, since I know it worked for you, are you able to use YouTube Red along with this Play Music free trial? Because my YT Red doesn't seem to be enabled for me. Ailín Ó’S No, unfortunately not as I live in the EU and YouTube Red is only available in USA. Carson Saldanha Weird, I'm in the US though. Ailín Ó’S Ooh that is odd. Sign out of the app then sign back in maybe? Carson Saldanha No luck :( I'm in contact with Google support atm Hopefully they can sort this out Mike Worth it alone for Youtube Red MisterAlex Sweet, I wasn't sure if that was included. Thanks. Should mention that in the main blog post. Ben Still no student membership >:( Ailín Ó’S Spotify is a great alternative @€$£5/month. Ben I know that's what I use just because it's half the price. Ailín Ó’S In Ireland Vodafone have a partnership with Spotify whereby it costs €5 standard instead of €10 regardless of if you're a student or not, they even bundle it with some of their plans. Vodafone do the same in some other countries they operate in (not all). Maybe see if any network in your country has a partnership like that? Worth a shot! Ben Oh yeah I'm on EE in the UK and I've got Apple Music for free for 6 months but like iTunes is a massive stinking turd. Ailín Ó’S I'd rather go back to the days of getting music via Bluetooth from friends than use crApple Music 😂😂 Rahul Krishna In india, we have play music for 1.4 usd/month Umang Ladia I'm only seeing 2 months offer in India.?? Rahul Krishna Well I subscribed to it when it launched here (about 2 months ago), so I can't confirm that. But at this price, there is nothing to be disappointed about. aRvInD I wish Spotify launches soon here. I can't keep using that patched version here...!! Rahul Krishna Me too xyz As it should be, you can't charge European or American prices in India. Rahul Krishna Yes true. There are lots​ of people here with a very cheap Android phone. They cannot pay much money. Julian Coronado That's actually what's keeping me away from Play Music. I've used my free months and I loved the Youtube Red too. But as a student, Spotify for $5 / month is too great to pass up on. Emiliejmosley Google is paying 97$ per hour! Work for few hours & have longer with friends and family! !sm141c: On tuesday I got a great new Land Rover Range Rover from having earned $8752 this last four weeks.. Its the most-financialy rewarding I've had.. Follow this link for more information !sm141c: ➽➽ ➽➽;➽➽ http://GoogleFinancialCashJobs431ShopRichGetPaid$97/Hour... ★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫::::::!sm141c:....,..... Cakefish Spotify ftw ToniCipriani ✓pǝᴉɟᴉɹǝʌ I don't think this is a new offer, got this a while back. In fact my 4 months is expiring next week. Prefer Spotify over it. Song selection a tad bit weaker, and for foreign songs it tries to translate the song names to English and makes it hard to look up. folkrav I like it, it's way cheaper than Spotify for me - my mother, my sister, my wife and myself each pay 30$ a year and we're set - but Jesus do I hate the clients. I don't like the website's interface, I hate the Android app. But yeah, I'll deal with it cause it's cheap, I guess. Carson Saldanha Got it! Yay! Jim I wish I could somehow get it on my Amazon Echo hahaha. I guess if I had paid for a Google Home it would be worth trying out. Forget vega #getEVGA Why google play music isn't available in my country ? Ailín Ó’S Try Apple Music? They seem to be just about everywhere. Iamsecond And this is why Apple continue to dominate, because Apple are truly interested in being an international company whereas Google is just playing at it. Such a shame xyz Because Google sucks. Bartek Juszczak My GPM radio's are so good these days I love that Google is so into AI. Whether It's just "I'm being lucky" or radio from a specific song, band or album they very rarely disappoint me these days. I just make sure to thumbs up if it plays a song I particularly love. I am a student and could go cheaper with spotify but the AI generated playlists have me locked in. If it's £5 cheaper but I'm not gonna enjoy it nearly as much then it's not really a good deal. AndTheWorldMayNeverKnow I used the 3 or 4 months free trial during the holidays then bought the family plan for $14.99 a month. 4 people in my family us it and it works great, the app could use some tweaks but it's really good overall. paev If you listen to main stream music it doesn't really matter what service to use. However, if you like something unusual, weird or other languages then Google is a way to go. I found bands on Google music that Spotify displayed as not found. Google also have new synth bands that Spotify doesn't. I'm for Google too. Daniel I discovered that GPM is kinda like a music label. I once went to a section of Google play explaining how indie artists can use GPM like a music label as long as they own all their rights. Ryne Hager Ultraista (among others) keeps me using Google Play Music as well as Spotify. Carson Saldanha Does anyone else who activated the Play Music trial have YouTube Red working as well? My YT Red doesn't seem to be enabled while my Play Music is. Michael Carr I spotted a similar offer a couple of months ago, and I took it after a day or two's thought. Just last week, I moved directly into a family plan. PewPewYoureDead It's hard to recommend Google Play Music until they revamp the UI. Margaritas Ante Porcos Google Music is the only choice in some markets, like Russia, where no Spotify or Pandora are available. There are too many shortcomings in Google Music and Google never shows interest in making services better than below average. I really wonder why Google refuses to become the best at anything. Real magic here. Pixel syndrome all the way. Yet Google Music is on my phone and I use it because there's no choice whatsoever. Rob You answered your own question. If there's no alternative, then they don't have any incentive to improve the service. SupahNin10doh Stupid Dorito logo...

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Saturday, 27 May 2017 | MYT 1:00 PM Google’s employee-run email list tracks bias complaints The “Yes, at Google” newsletter is less than eight months old but has picked up subscribers and interest in the past few months as other companies have faced more public allegations of sexual harassment. — Reuters At most companies, if you think you’ve witnessed sexual harassment, sexism, bigotry or racism, there’s one way to get it addressed: going to human resources.  At Google, there's another way to air your grievance: submitting your complaint to an employee-run message board that's curated into a weekly email.  The list, called “Yes, at Google,” is a grassroots effort to collect anonymous submissions at Google and parent Alphabet Inc and communicate them across the company, according to five current employees who receive the emails.  “Yes, at Google” tracks allegations of unwelcome behaviour at work in an attempt to make the company more inclusive, said the employees, who did not want to be named because they were not authorised to speak about internal company matters. Since starting in October, more than 15,000 employees – 20% of the company's workforce – have subscribed, according to two of those people.  Google management is aware of the list. “We work really hard to promote and preserve a culture of respect and inclusion,” a Google spokesperson said in a statement. “Our employees have numerous ways to raise issues – both negative and positive – with us, including through grassroots transparency efforts like this one. We take concerns seriously and take appropriate measures to address them.”  The list is run by a group of workers across different product areas, according to a person familiar with the list, though it's not clear who runs the list and how or whether the submissions are vetted before being distributed.  Usually, the people in the complaints are not named, though one submission described an instance when, during a large company meeting in late April, Alphabet executive chairman Eric Schmidt allegedly interrupted chief financial officer Ruth Porat when she had a question addressed to her, which the post categorised as a “gender-related” complaint. A person who attended the meeting said Schmidt answered the question to make a joke. Messages sometimes include job titles and other details.  Google, along with other tech companies, is facing growing pressure from diversity advocates and the media to change the gender and racial makeup of its workforce, which is largely white and Asian men. But inside company walls, employees are also speaking up about what they see as unfair treatment. The weekly e-mail – whose title is meant to suggest that yes, these things happen at Google, even if you don't see them – is one way employees are pushing for awareness and change.  Google management doesn't control or influence the content, though the list's organisers sometimes ask teams or particular employees to respond to an item before publication, according to a person familiar with the list who was not authorised to speak about it. Executives have touted the list internally as a way that Google is trying to make its workplace welcome to all kinds of employees.  In February, former Uber engineer Susan Fowler wrote a widely read blog post detailing alleged sexual harassment and other mistreatment at Uber (in response to Fowler's allegations, Uber is conducting an internal investigation into its workplace culture). After her post, a group of Google vice-presidents sent staff an e-mail that listed resources that might help prevent similar things happening at Google. “Yes, at Google” was included as a resource.  A dispatch from early May viewed by Bloomberg listed dozens of alleged incidents. One person reported a manager to HR for allegedly “joking about raping one of his direct reports,” the e-mail said. “He was promoted.”  Another allegation: “A colleague started a meeting off by making a joke that called a woman in the adjacent meeting room '€some random bitch.’”  In another, a writer alleges that a “Noogler” – new Googler – was invited by an engineer to get drinks with a group of colleagues off campus. It was her second week of work. “Upon arriving, discovered there was no group,” the email said. “Subsequently informed by the engineer that she was expected to ‘sleep with everyone' because that's the culture here.”  The message was accompanied by this note from the newsletter operators: “Per the Employee Relations Team, this is an example of the kind of issue that we need and want to look into as this behaviour is unacceptable and contrary to our Code of Conduct and Policy Against Harassment.” The e-mail urged anyone who knows of the identity of the people involved or the time and place it occurred to share it with the company, “so we can look into this matter and address it appropriately.”  The e-mail also refers to some alleged incidents as examples of when employees should formally raise concerns with the company. “A male Googler drank excessively at an offsite event and touched a few different female Googlers in a manner that made them uncomfortable, made inappropriate comments, and followed two women back to their hotel room and told them ‘I'm following you,'” the email said. “Thanks to Googlers who came forward with information about these incidents, we investigated, substantiated the concerns and terminated the Googler's employment.”  Google management will try to respond to some complaints if they are specific enough, according to a person familiar with the list.  A list like “Yes, at Google” introduces business risks, said Peter Cappelli, a management professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton Business School. If a submission were proven libellous, that could be a legal complication for the company. And having a fifth of a company's workforce reading a weekly collection of complaints could amplify discontent among employees, he said.  In 2014, Google became one of the first high-profile tech companies to release employee diversity figures, starting an industry trend. The company's proportions have not improved much in three years – 81% of its technical staff is male, as of last year, and less than 6% are races other than Asian or white. Google runs implicit bias training internally aimed at addressing some of subtle forms of prejudice that persist inside workplaces.  Google is currently under investigation by the US Department of Labour for alleged systemic pay discrimination against its female employees. Google denied the allegations and said that its yearly analysis of pay across men and women found no gender pay gap.  ”Yes, at Google” wouldn't be the first time employees at the search giant organised to raise awareness about perceived inequality. In 2015, Erica Joy Baker, then a site reliability engineer at the company, started a spreadsheet where employees could submit their salaries and titles to compare them against others. She said that she was called into meetings and told that upper managers were not pleased with the spreadsheet's existence. She quit in 2015 for a job at workplace chat service Slack.  “Our policy is not to comment on individual or former employees, but we can confirm that we regularly run analysis of compensation, promotion, and performance to ensure that they are equitable with no pay gap. Employees are free to share their salaries with one another if they choose,” Google said in a statement regarding salary-sharing in 2015.  The “Yes, at Google” newsletter is less than eight months old but has picked up subscribers and interest in the past few months as other companies have faced more public allegations of sexual harassment. Google also faced blowback in February when Uber said it asked for the resignation of Amit Singhal, a senior executive, after discovering he was the subject of a sexual harassment claim when he worked at Google. Singhal denied the allegation.  Not all the complaints in the Google mailing list include allegations of misconduct such as sexual harassment. Other entries allege workplace comments that might not be obviously offensive to everyone but made some employees uncomfortable, said the current employees.  One submission calls out a comment someone wrote in an internal referral that a job candidate "is definite [sic] one of the smartest girls I've met.” Another: “Coworker to me:‘You know why the schools in Pleasanton are so good, right? Because of all the Chinese people.'”  One employee said that the hairdressers who work at the Google campus sometimes say, “I've never encountered hair like yours before,” which the employee said “comes across as code for ‘I'm not trained to cut the hair of people of your race.'"  One employee said that during a one-on-one performance review with a manager, he was told that his rating dropped from “Exceeds” to “Meets” because he didn't get as much done while on paternity leave. In another, a female subordinate said that her manager asked her to do work that he then took credit for when passing on the work to a higher-ranking director. A female employee was allegedly called a “princess” for favouring salad over burgers. Another employee claims that new desks at a particular office location only come designed for right-handed workers.  The mailing list also includes actions or changes that employees found praiseworthy, according to staff that have viewed them. The drinks menu at weekly all-hands meetings were updated to include a wider range of non-alcoholic beverages, and the men's restrooms in the San Francisco offices have menstruation products to accommodate men who have periods. When YouTube rolled out a data tool with a name that some employees outside the US found offensive, the name was quickly changed.   Cappelli, the management professor, said that despite the risks that such a list poses, a collection of complaints from employees is also a valuable resource for management – especially about sensitive topics that employees may be reluctant to talk about.  Keeping an eye on a list similar to Google's “could be a pretty smart thing for an employer to do,” he said. “You can find out stuff that's going on without having to do surveys. Employees don't necessarily trust hotlines, and they certainly don't always trust going to their supervisor with problems.” — Bloomberg Related Stories You May Be Interested GameStop posts strong first-quarter sales, but leaves forecast unchanged Russia’s disinformation efforts hit 39 countries: researchers Vietnam says Google will cooperate in removal of ‘toxic’ content Hackers sought to discredit Russian opposition leader: researchers Startup wants to transform travel enthusiasts into online agents Racing for a better tomorrow Others Also Read More US tourists coming to our shores soon Australia's McMahon to miss June series with wrist injury ‘Maxximising‘ viewing experience advertisement Latest News How technology is changing our art, our world – and even ourselves Seattle startup founder sought a business partner, got a women’s alliance instead These are the most-booked destinations on Airbnb for summer Russia’s disinformation efforts hit 39 countries: researchers Google’s employee-run email list tracks bias complaints Most Viewed in Tech These are the most-booked destinations on Airbnb for summer How technology is changing our art, our world – and even ourselves Seattle startup founder sought a business partner, got a women’s alliance instead Digital wallet services gain rising acceptance Russia’s disinformation efforts hit 39 countries: researchers Face of Facebook returns Fractious politics leads ‘Far Cry’ videogame to US Powered by advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

Anyone with the corresponding app on their device can pay for goods and services with a simple tap of their phone against a compatible point-of-sale terminal with near-field communication, or NFC. Here’s everything you need to know about Android Pay, including the places and banks that support it. PayPal joins Android Pay Android Pay is an excellent replacement for your credit or debit cards but what about your PayPal account? Starting May 24, Android Pay users running version 4.4 or higher of the mobile operating system will be able to link PayPal to their profile. Previously, the only way to use the popular web-based payment platform in-store was through a PayPal debit card, or by inputting your phone number and PIN into one of the few compatible terminals out in the wild. To get started paying with PayPal from your Android device, tap the button at the bottom right like you normally would to add a card, then select “Add other payment methods.” PayPal may ask you to load funds to your account if you have not already. If you do not see the option yet, it may take a little while before the update rolls out to your device. Additionally, it is important to note PayPal support is only live for U.S. users at this time. Android Pay is currently only able to pull from your PayPal balance for transactions but eventually, any cards you have saved on your PayPal account will also be supported. International release Android Pay made its debut on the global stage when it launched in the U.K. in May 2016, and the service has slowly continued to expand since. It’s now available in Japan, Ireland, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, and Poland. At Google I/O 2017, the company announced the service will arrive in at least another five countries before the end of the year: Brazil, Canada, Russia, Spain, and Taiwan. We don’t have details on specific launch partners for each territory but check back for updates as more information becomes available. Canada Android Pay could launch in Canada as soon as May 31, according to MobileSyrup, which cites anonymous sources. At the moment, it’s not officially known which banks and card companies will support the platform when it debuts. However, some clues dating back to late last year hint at support from Interac, one of Canada’s debit payment processing networks. This was revealed by 9to5Google when it investigated the Android Pay app back in December. At the time, some users also reported they were able to add and complete transactions with certain Visa cards through Android Pay. This caused many to believe the service had officially been launched, but Google elaborated shortly afterward, claiming that it wasn’t quite ready for prime time yet. Since then, some of the cards that were working have had support removed. Russia Prior to Google I/O, four banks were named in relation to Android Pay’s Russian launch: Sberbank, Alfa, Raiffeisen, and Tinkoff. These banks could be the first to receive the service when it launches over the coming months. The report comes courtesy of Russian news sites by way of AndroidPolice, which also relays that Visa recently updated its Russian support pages with references to Android Pay, before removing them from the site. In tandem with Google’s confirmation at I/O, this means launch could be imminent. Belgium Google is officially bringing Android Pay to Belgium. The company announced the news in a blog post, which highlights that the service will be usable in as many as 85,000 institutions. It will work with both MasterCard and Visa and supports three major banks — BNP, Fintro, and Hello Bank. Not only that, but the company says that CBC, KBC, and KBC Brussels are all on the way. Japan Contactless and mobile payments are already widely used in Japan, and on December 12, Android Pay becomes the latest option for shoppers. However, it has launched with Rakuten Edy, an eMoney service accepted in more than 470,000 locations, rather than local banks. Operated through the usual Android Pay app, you create an Edy card or use an existing one, ready to use in supporting stores. In 2017, Google says to expect more payment options, including Visa and Mastercard, through its cooperation with local payment specialists FeliCa Networks. Ireland On December 6, Android Pay made its way to Ireland, and it promises compatibility “at thousands of retail locations throughout Ireland that accept contactless payments.” From McDonald’s to supermarket Tesco to book retailer Eason, there are plenty of places in which Europeans can now use Android Pay. Here is a list of places where Android Pay is now accepted in Ireland. New Zealand In November, New Zealand received access to Android Pay, and according to Google, it will be available at a number of common locations, including The Warehouse, Domino’s, McDonald’s, etc. As of right now, it only supports the BNZ Flexi Debit Visa card, but it will expand to more services as time goes on. Poland Poland got Android Pay in November, and Google says it’s available at more than 400,000 retail locations such as Costa Coffee, Carrefour, and Rossman. You can add your Mastercard or Visa debit or credit cards from the following Polish banks: Alior Bank, Bank Zachodni WBK, and T-Mobile Banking Services. Google says support for mBank will come soon, as well as other banks in the coming months. The payment service will also be available in various apps soon, including Allegro, Ceneo, Fancy, iTaxi.pl, and Uber. Hong Kong In October, Android Pay launched in Hong Kong, with a related blog post announcement noting that the service would be accepted “at over 5,000 locations in Hong Kong where contactless payments are accepted, including stores such as at 7-Eleven, Circle K, Fortress, Mannings, Maxim’s Cakes, MX, McDonald’s, Pacific Coffee, ParknShop, SmarTone, Watsons, Wellcome, and more.” Moreover, it also works in several apps including Boutir Collect, Deliveroo, Kaligo, Klook, Snaptee, and coming soon, Uber. You can check here to see all the supported banks in Hong Kong, including Hang Seng Bank, DBS Bank, Dah Sing Bank, the Bank of East Asia, Standard Chartered Bank, and more. Australia In Australia, Google has listed an impressive number of supported banks — more than 25 including ANZ, Beyond Bank, and Macquarie. Unfortunately, ANZ is the only one out of the top four banks in Australia to support the payment service. To see the list of supported Australian banks, check here. Aussies will also soon be able to use Android Pay within select apps such as Catch of the Day, Deliveroo, Domino’s, EatNow, Hotel Tonight, Kogan.com and more. That means speedier checkout times in apps as you won’t have to type out all your credit card information. Singapore In late June, Singapore became the third country to get Android Pay. It’s compatible with any contactless terminal in the country and supports loyalty cards and credit card rewards programs. The service is compatible with MasterCard and Visa cards from many of the country’s largest institutions, including DBS Bank, Standard Chartered Bank, OCBC Bank, POSB Bank, and UOB. You can check the full list of supported banks in Singapore here. United Kingdom Google’s first financial partners in the U.K. are the Bank of Scotland, First Direct, Halifax, HSBC, Lloyds Bank, Nationwide, MBNA, and M&S Bank. The search giant recently added Santander, RBS, Ulster Bank, and NatWest to the list. Both MasterCard and Visa debit and credit cards from co-operating banks will work, and TSB customers should know only selected account types can use the service. Even though it supports Apple Pay, it doesn’t look like Barclays will ever support Android Pay. The second-largest U.K. bank launched its own NFC payments service called Contactless Mobile. You can check this list to see which banks support Android Pay in the U.K. Retailers that will accept Android Pay payments include Costa Coffee and Starbucks, Boots, Waitrose, Aldi, Superdrug, and KFC. Plus, like Apple Pay, transport for London’s ticketing system will support it. Various shopping apps such as Deliveroo, Fancy, Kickstarter, Zara, Takeaway.com, and Hotel Tonight will offer Android Pay as a payment option. The contactless payment restriction of £30 remains in place, but in some situations, you’ll be able to spend up to £100 provided you authorize the transaction using a fingerprint or PIN code. SUPPORT IN THE U.S. All four major banks in the U.S. support Android Pay — that’s Chase Bank, Wells Fargo, Citibank, and Bank of America. Chase Bank grossly lagged behind the rest of the major U.S. banks, but as of September 2016, it has finally added support for Android Pay. Of course, plenty of other banks are also lagging behind, but now the likes of BMO Harris have finally added support for the service. In addition to adding your credit and debit cards to the service, Bank of America is installing NFC-enabled ATMs around the country — this would allow you to access your bank account to withdraw cash just by tapping your phone. Other U.S. institutions, integrations In May 2017, Google announced support for 71 new banks and credit unions, including 1st Constitution Bank, Central State Bank, and more. If your bank or credit union didn’t already support Android Pay, it may well do so now. You can check out the full list of supported banks and credit unions for yourself here. Before that, Google added 46 new banks to its roster, but they are names many will not recognize, except for Fifth Third Bank. Some of the others, according to Android Police, include the Alaska USA Federal Credit Union, Greenfield Banking Company, and the Peoples Federal Credit Union. You can check to see if your bank supports the service here. Most banks that already support Apple Pay will back Google’s service since both use similar NFC technology for payments — other top institutions include PNC, Capital One, TD Bank, HSBC, American Express, Ally Bank, and USAA. In mid-December, the company added support for 31 additional rural banks and credit unions across the contiguous United States. They include Allegacy Federal Credit Union, the Bank of Walterboro, Canyon State Credit Union, First Piedmont Federal Savings, Jackson Community Federal Credit Union, Northeast Georgia Bank, San Francisco FCU, USC Credit Union, Verve, and Washington Trust Bank. The expanded support comes on the heels of 19 additions earlier in December 2016. These include 1st Advantage Federal Credit Union, ACU of Texas, Alpine Credit Union, Alternatives FCU, Bank of the Ozarks, Union State Bank of Fargo, and Valley Federal Credit Union. MasterCard, Visa, American Express, and Discover support Android Pay. Sites that support Visa Checkout and Masterpass will soon be able to handle Android Pay as well, thanks to a strategic partnership. You’ll be able to use your fingerprint to confirm payments as well, and Visa Checkout and Masterpass customers will be able to link their accounts with Android Pay as well. The integration will roll out in early 2017. Mobile banking app integration Android Pay is now integrating with several banking apps around the world to make it a little easier to use Android Pay. Now, many customers will be able to add cards to Android Pay from their mobile banking apps at the tap of a button. At the launch of the new feature, there are a few banks that are supported, including Bank of America, Discover, Bank of New Zealand, mBank, and USAA. In-App and mobile web purchases Although you’ll probably use Android Pay mostly in shops, it will also let you make in-app purchases. When you’re about to purchase something in an app that supports the service, you’ll see a button that will allow you to pay using Android Pay, eliminating the need to get your wallet and pull out your credit or debit card. At the moment, Google has listed more than a dozen apps that support in-app purchases with Android Pay including Lyft, OpenTable, Hotel Tonight, Instacart, and, most recently, Etsy. If you make purchases via the Chrome Browser app on your phone, you’re in luck. Google is adding support for Android Pay for certain sites, making the checkout process less of a hassle. It currently works with a handful of sites such as Groupon and 1-800-Flowers. The integration with Visa Checkout and Masterpass is sure to boost the number of sites that support Android Pay as well. “Just like in stores and in apps, Android Pay does not share actual account numbers with merchants, so users can shop online with confidence, knowing that Android Pay keeps their card number secure,” according to the Android blog. COMPATIBLE DEVICES AND SECURITY To use Android Pay, you’ll need an NFC-enabled smartphone running Android 4.4 KitKat and above. It will work at stores with NFC contactless payment terminals. Like most NFC payment systems, Android Pay comes with all the necessary security, including a way to shut down devices that have been stolen so nobody can use your card. The system uses tokenization, which processes transactions via individual random account numbers, rather than your actual credit or debit card account number. In-app purchases are as safe as its NFC contactless counterpart. Rewards and loyalty As Android Pay is meant to replace your wallet, it’s expanding to include all those other cards you would typically have on you as well — gift and loyalty cards. Google has been expanding its partnerships, and as such the company says Android Pay is the first mobile wallet to “deeply integrate” with Uber’s Payment Rewards program. Walgreens says its Balance Rewards members can now apply their loyalty account via Android Pay at checkout. If you’re a member, all you need to do is add your Balance Rewards card to the Android Pay app. When you’re at the register, hold up your Android smartphone to the NFC terminal to apply your rewards information — when you’re ready to pay, hold the smartphone up again at the same place. You’ll have to add your credit or debit card beforehand to complete the purchase, of course. Stores with NFC terminals support Android Pay Like all other forms of NFC payment, Android Pay will be accepted in more than one million stores across the United States, including Toys ‘R’ Us, GameStop, Subway, Whole Foods, and more. Walmart does not accept contactless payments, yet.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Saturday, 27 May 2017 | MYT 12:00 PM Digital wallet services gain rising acceptance by george avalos The most common mobile-payment activities include paying bills through a mobile phone or web browser, buying items or digital content remotely with a phone, and paying for goods in a store with a phone, according to the Federal Reserve Bank in a report titled Consumers and Mobile Financial Services 2016. — Reuters SAN JOSE: Money and wallets simply aren't what they used to be.  Tech giants' card-less payment services – including Apple Pay, Android Pay from Google and Samsung Pay – aim to ease the path to the truly digital wallet, and researchers project huge growth in adoption by retailers and consumers. Even staid financial giants such as Wells Fargo and Bank of America are behind a push to encourage and enable customers to access ATMs without their debit cards.  Yet the digital wallet business has gotten off to a rough start, said Bay Area-based analyst Trip Chowdhry, managing director with Global Equities Research.  "There have been many false starts in this industry," Chowdhry said. "The current payment methods are intrusive, and they are not seamless."  Even so, card-less payment services are here to stay.  "Mobile proximity payments, enabled though near-field-communications, are projected to vastly increase to US$118bil (RM503.68bil) in 2018, up from US$3.5bil (RM14.91bil) in 2014," according to a report by Statista, a web-based data and statistics company. "Some of the benefits of mobile payments include the speed of payment, the convenience as well as the integration with pre-existing loyalty and coupon programs."  These benefits point to a brave new world of virtual wallets.  The most common mobile-payment activities include paying bills through a mobile phone or web browser, buying items or digital content remotely with a phone, and paying for goods in a store with a phone, according to the Federal Reserve Bank in a report titled Consumers and Mobile Financial Services 2016.  As of December 2016, Apple Pay led the way in North American retailers' adoption of mobile-payment systems, with 36% acceptance, according to Statista. PayPal had 34% acceptance, Mastercard PayPass had 25%, Android Pay had 24%, Visa CheckOut had 20% and Samsung Pay had 18%, the report said.  One of the next steps, analysts say, is to make payments seamless for the consumer, and to make it easy for shoppers to pick up items in stores without lining up at check stands.  This sort of convenience is already available in a different industry that new technologies have disrupted: "Uber and Lyft enable users to simply get out of the car at the end of the journey, while the app seamlessly processes the fare in the background," Sunnyvale-based technology company Rambus noted in a report.  The technology providers also need to overcome consumers' worries about security.  Campbell-based market researcher Creative Strategies recently studied digital wallets to assess barriers to greater adoption of the services.  "We found that fears about security, trusting in the apps, are the primary concerns," said Ben Bajarin, a principal analyst. "Consumers don't quite buy the story that they are secure. They are concerned that anything in a digital form can be stolen."  Bajarin said Apple, Android and Samsung mobile payment technologies all encrypt users' information, securing their credit card details.  "Compared to a physical credit card or physical wallet that can be stolen, digital wallets are secure," he said.  Here is a brief look at some of the technology leaders in mobile payments.  Apple Pay  Apple Pay is a free digital wallet and mobile payment service that can be used to make in-person payments and is compatible with an array of contact-less terminals. The system is live in 15 countries, including the United States and Canada, along with United Kingdom, France, Russia, China, Japan and several other European and Asian countries.  Q: How many retailers accept your service today? A: Tens of millions of customers are now using Apple Pay, and more than 13 million contact-less enabled locations exist in the countries where the service is live, Apple said in a statement. More than 4.5 million locations now accept Apple Pay in the US.  Retailers that support Apple Pay include Best Buy, B&H Photo, Bloomingdale's, Chevron, Disney, Dunkin' Donuts, GameStop, Jamba Juice, Kohl's, Lucky, McDonald's, Office Depot, Petco, Sprouts, Staples, KFC, Trader Joe's, Walgreens and Whole Foods, according to the MacRumors site.  Q: What improvements are you making to the service? A: Apple didn't disclose any upcoming upgrades. But Apple Chief Executive Officer Timothy Cook told analysts during a conference call this month: "Apple Pay is experiencing phenomenal traction. We're seeing strong, growing usage as points of acceptance expand, with transaction volume up 450 percent in the US alone."  Android Pay  Google developed the Android Pay digital wallet platform to power tap-to-pay purchases on mobile devices so customers can make payments with Android-based phones, tablets, or watches. Android Pay uses the near-field communications technology to exchange bank card information so funds can be transferred to the retailer.  Q: How many retailers accept your service today? A: "We don't have this number available to share," said Genevieve Park, a Google spokeswoman. However, some of the retailers using Android Pay are Best Buy, BJ's Wholesale Club, Bloomingdale's, Coca Cola, Dunkin' Donuts, Game Stop, Jamba Juice, Kentucky Fried Chicken, Macy's, Meijer, Panera Bread, Subway, Trader Joe's, Walgreens, Wegmans and Whole Foods.  Q: What improvements are you making to the service? A: A Google alliance with PayPal enables people to tap their PayPal accounts to make payments using their Android phones; Google has teamed up with multiple banks, including Bank of America and USAA Bank, to add bank cards to the Android Pay platform; and Gmail users can send money as an attachment in an email, the company said in a statement.  "Android Pay is a mobile wallet that allows Android users to save their credit, debit and loyalty cards to their phone and pay easily in-store, in-app, and on the mobile web," Google said.  Samsung Pay  Samsung Pay uses near-field communication technology and supports more than 500 banks and credit unions, which together represent more than 85% of the US debit card and credit card market.  Q: How many major retailers accept your service today? A: Samsung Pay works at more than 90% of the top 250 retailers and the vast majority of merchants, including small, local businesses, Samsung said. Because Samsung Pay supports both Near-Field Communications (NFC) and Magnetic Secure Transmission (MST) technologies, Samsung Pay is accepted almost anywhere you can swipe or tap your credit card, it said.  Samsung Pay is driving toward the goal of universal merchant acceptance, which is critical to consumer adoption, Samsung said.  Q: What improvements are you making to the service? A: Samsung has provided new incentives to help customers reach for their phones every time they go through checkout. Samsung Rewards, for example, serves as the loyalty platform for the entire Samsung ecosystem, working much like standard credit card points programs.  "With Samsung Rewards rapidly accelerating consumer adoption of mobile payments, and Samsung Pay's ability to work almost anywhere you can swipe a credit card unlike other solutions, we know that Samsung Pay is uniquely positioned to lead the mobile payments industry into the future," said Nana Murugesan, general manager of services and new business at Samsung Electronics America.  Wells Fargo  Instead of a physical card, customers can now use a mobile Wells Fargo app to choose card-free ATM access and then obtain a one-time token for that session to conduct transactions at the machine.  "Wells Fargo is the first large bank in the U.S. to have card-less ATM technology on our entire fleet," said Ruben Pulido, a Wells Fargo spokesman.  Bank of America  Bank of America focuses on digital wallets for its card-less ATM services.  "The way we deployed card-less technologies is we are accepting all digital wallets, including Apple Pay, Samsung Pay and Android Pay," said Charles Liu, chief of branch transformation, ATM innovation and market strategy. "We have enabled this so all of the digital wallets will work with our ATMs. You simply place your phone near an ATM terminal and they communicate with each other."  This sort of access is available at more than half of the Bank of America ATMs in the US and can be activated by uploading the bank card information to a digital wallet.  Retailers  Macy's and Bloomingdale's both accept Apple Pay, Android Pay and Samsung Pay, said Orlando Veras, a spokesman for Macy's Inc, whose subsidiaries include the two department store chains.  The only digital wallet Walmart accepts is Walmart Wallet, the retailer said in an e-mailed response. — San Jose Mercury News/Tribune News Service  Related Stories You May Be Interested Vietnam says Google will cooperate in removal of ‘toxic’ content Russia’s disinformation efforts hit 39 countries: researchers Google kills recruiters’ recovery with jobs for the bots Google’s employee-run email list tracks bias complaints Hackers sought to discredit Russian opposition leader: researchers Racing for a better tomorrow Others Also Read Chew: Come to us for help Political analyst: Dr M like a father who had tried to sell his 'son' Tourism important for economy advertisement Latest News How technology is changing our art, our world – and even ourselves Seattle startup founder sought a business partner, got a women’s alliance instead These are the most-booked destinations on Airbnb for summer Russia’s disinformation efforts hit 39 countries: researchers Google’s employee-run email list tracks bias complaints Most Viewed in Tech These are the most-booked destinations on Airbnb for summer How technology is changing our art, our world – and even ourselves Seattle startup founder sought a business partner, got a women’s alliance instead Russia’s disinformation efforts hit 39 countries: researchers Face of Facebook returns Google’s employee-run email list tracks bias complaints Fractious politics leads ‘Far Cry’ videogame to US Powered by advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

Meizu M5 Note review: Do not buy this phone Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/01/18 9:15am PDTJan 18, 2017 19 Plus 1 on G+ 43 Share on Facebook 56 Share on Twitter Total Shares118 Meizu News Phone Reviews Reviews Article Contents 1 Specs 2 The Good 3 The Not So Good 4 Design and materials 5 Camera 6 Performance 7 Software 8 Battery 9 Conclusion It would be understandable if you have never heard of Meizu. While it is one of the top electronics companies in mainland China, the company isn't massively popular outside of the country. The M5 Note is the newest device to come out of Meizu, and like many of its recent phones, is being sold internationally. From the spec sheet, the M5 Note looks like a solid device. A Mediatek Helio P10 CPU, 1080p LCD screen, at least 3GB of RAM, a massive 4,000mAh battery. The price is perhaps most impressive, costing just 899 CNY for the base model - roughly $131 USD. For comparison, the Moto G4 Play with a Snapdragon 410, 720p display, and 2GB of RAM costs more at its regular price. With great specifications at an incredibly low price, the M5 Note almost seems too good to be true. Unfortunately, it is. Specs CPU MediaTek Helio P10 CPU GPU Mali-T860 GPU RAM 3/4GB Display 5.5" 1080p LCD Storage 16GB/32GB/64GB Battery 4,000mAh Cameras 13 MP Rear, 5 MP Front Software Flyme OS 5.2 (based on Android 6.0 Marshmallow) The Good Screen The 1080p display is probably the best feature of the M5 Note. Speakers The built-in speakers are firmly in the 'good enough' category. Ports There's a headphone jack. The Not So Good Software There are countless issues with Flyme OS, starting with no Google services being installed by default. Battery life The poor implementation of Google Play Services causes the battery life to plummet, even with light use. Notifications I could not receive notifications through Google Hangouts, among a few other apps. Ports (again) The M5 Note only has a MicroUSB port, not USB Type-C. Design and materials The M5 Note, as the name might imply, is a rather large phone. The device itself is roughly 154mm tall, 75mm wide, and 8mm thick - almost identical in size to the Pixel XL and now-discontinued Galaxy Note7. Besides the physical size, the first thing you might notice when holding the M5 Note is the weight. Whereas my Pixel is just 143 grams (5.04 oz), the Note is 175 grams (6.17 oz). The extra weight is largely thanks to the included 4,000mAh battery, which I'll get to later. Overall, I didn't really mind the extra weight, but it is certainly noticeable compared to most flagship devices. Aesthetically, the M5 Note seems closest to the iPhone 6S. It has the same reflective metal around the home button's edge, the same aluminum back, the same antenna bands, and so on. The speakers and headphone jack are in the exact same position as well. This premium look and feel (even if unoriginal) seems out of place on a budget phone, and it's one of the M5 Note's best qualities. That being said, the M5 Note is not a completely shameless copy. The large camera lens sits in the top center of the back casing, instead of the iPhone's top-left corner lens. Like most Android devices, the power button and volume rockers are on the same side. Annoyingly (or at least for me), the power button is positioned below the volume. Perhaps the strangest design choice on the M5 Note is the navigation buttons - or rather, lack thereof. The home button, much like on the iPhone, serves as the only means of navigating through the operating system. Pressing the button takes you to the home screen, swiping or tapping the button acts as the back button, and swiping up from the bottom of the display brings up recent applications. While this form of navigation is certainly bizarre, I got used to it fairly quickly. I would have preferred software navigation buttons, but I suppose it could be worse. Camera Previous Next The M5 Note has two cameras - a 13 MP rear camera and a 5 MP front camera. Both are unexceptional, as should be expected for a phone at this price point. Outdoor shots with enough light are usually good, such as the first photo, but still appear washed out. Inside/low-light photos often appear blurry and unfocused, even when capturing stationary objects with the M5 Note on a tripod. With many budget devices, a good camera is often a low priority, and it certainly was with the M5 Note. Performance As you may have noticed in the table above, the M5 Note is powered by the MediaTek Helio P10 CPU. The CPU has eight ARM Cortex A53 cores, clocked at 1.81GHz each. Graphics are handled by the Mali-T860 GPU, and depending on your model, the M5 Note has either 3GB or 4GB of RAM. There's also no USB Type-C port to be found - just microUSB. On the Geekbench 4 CPU test, the Meizu M5 Note scores 696 for single-core performance and 2118 for multi-core performance (full results here). The single-core score is dreadful, comparable to the Samsung Galaxy S4 (679) and Neuxs 7 2013 (660). The multi-core score fares a bit better, ranking close to the OnePlus X (2088) and LG G3 (2142). In day to day usage, I would describe the M5 Note as 'acceptable' in performance. Most apps do take a second or two to open, but overall the phone never felt bogged down or especially slow. Again, for roughly $131 USD, you shouldn't expect flagship-level speed. But what about games? Much like the CPU, the GPU is nothing to write home about. The 3DMark Sling Shot test running at 1080p with OpenGL ES 3.0 scored 498 (full results here). This places the phone alongside the LG Optimus G Pro (488), LG Stylus 2 Plus (510), and Oppo R9 (494). This should be enough to power through most games, with my test of GTA San Andreas only dropping frames when setting visual effects to the max. While I'm on the topic of hardware, let's talk band compatibility. Like many Chinese smartphones, the M5 Note does not support the LTE bands in the United States, and doesn't work at all on CDMA carriers like Verizon. On my Project Fi SIM card (only connecting to T-Mobile towers, since I'm using an unsupported device) I often switched between HSPA+ and 3G. Software Previous Next The Meizu M5 Note runs Flyme OS, the company's skinned version of Android 6.0 Marshmallow. While the Note was originally announced to ship with Flyme OS 6 (still unfortunately based on Marshmallow), my review unit shipped with version 5.2.11. As with many Chinese Android ROMs, Flyme OS takes some visual cues from iOS. The notifications panel has a frosted glass background, the launcher doesn't have a separate app drawer, and so on. While I don't mind the overall design, it doesn't share much in common with Material Design. However, Flyme OS seriously cripples this phone. The major problem is that the device ships without Google Mobile Services, which I consider essential to every Android device. GMS not only includes the Google Play Store, but also Google Play Services - essential for most Google applications to even work. This may be acceptable in China, but with the M5 Note being sold internationally, this is a huge problem. Instead of the Play Store, the M5 Note includes the non-descriptive "App Store" and "Hot Apps." The former seems to be a front-end for the sketchy 9APP repository, filled with unauthorized re-uploads from the Play Store and bootleg games. The latter is simply a list of recommended applications, with only an Install button for each item - you can't even view a description. Once you install an application, it vanishes from Hot Apps entirely. Notice how I said the M5 Note "ships" without Google Mobile Services. One of the many sketchy applications visible in 'Hot Apps' is an installer for Google services, which installs everything you need to get the Play Store and your favorite Google apps up and running. If you have ever flashed a gapps package on a custom ROM, this is the same basic concept. However, there is one problem - Meizu is not a GMS partner, which means they are not allowed to distribute Google's library of applications at all. As outlined by David, allowing users to install GMS on uncertified devices could lead to problems down the road. So why does the M5 Note not have GMS installed by default? The most likely answer is that Meizu also ships phones with YunOS (formally known as Aliyun), which is not strictly Android-compatible. The terms for becoming a GMS partner dictate that the given OEM must not ship devices with incompatible forks of Android. So essentially, until Meizu stops selling YunOS devices, they would be blocked from becoming a GMS partner. Flyme OS has some other issues as well. Initially while writing this review, I was unable to change the wallpaper at all - with the error message asking me to "upgrade the system and try again." A recent system update later fixed this problem. Perhaps as not much of a surprise, the M5 Note with GMS also fails SafetyNet, so you won't be playing Pokemon GO on the M5 Note. In addition, during my entire time using this device, I was unable to receive notifications for Hangouts (as well as two other apps). With it being my most-used communication tool, I had to keep my Google Pixel on-hand at all times to ensure I would receive important messages. Battery This is by far the most surprising aspect of this phone, and the primary reason why I cannot recommend the M5 Note to anyone. As explained in the Software section, the M5 Note has not been approved by Google to run Google Mobile Services. Shortly after setting up the device, I used the Google Services installer to obtain the Play Store and related Google services, as I'm sure many other customers will do. Thanks to Flyme OS not being certified for use with GMS, the Google Play Store absolutely tanks battery life on this phone. With a 4,000mAh battery, I was expecting at least a noticeable increase in battery life over my Nexus 5X. What I got instead was the worst battery life I have ever experienced on an Android device. The Play Store regularly consumed 15-25% of my Note's battery in regular use, with Google Play Services always following closely behind. My typical workload on a phone consists of checking various social media applications, some searches and news reading in Chrome, and the occasional Netflix TV episode or short YouTube video. In the time I was able to stand using the M5 Note as my daily driver, I did not see more than three hours of screen-on-time. You might have already scrolled down to leave a comment along the lines of "Corbin, why don't you just uninstall GMS? Then the battery issue would be solved." And while you might be right, I don't consider Android phones without the Play Store or Google Play Services to be usable at all. Searching on F-Droid for long-abandoned alternatives to my favorite applications is not a very enjoyable experience. Conclusion The Meizu M5 Note, put simply, is a bad phone. I wasn't expecting to be blown away, especially at this price point, but the annoyances are not worth the savings. The poor implementation of Google Play Services, the awful battery life, the sketchy included app store, buggy skin, and issues with notifications make the M5 Note unusable as a phone for me - I would take my first-gen Moto G over this any day. While this is clearly designed for the Chinese market, hence the microUSB port and lack of support for US LTE bands, this still has many more problems than other Chinese-aimed smartphones do. Even if you're in a region where the M5 Note is being sold (which isn't North America), you should absolutely not buy this phone. Tags m5 note meizu meizu m5 note subscribe ...

Corbin Davenport USB Type-C is still rare on Chinese Android devices, outside of flagship devices. It's understandable, much like the lack of LTE bands for America, but still a bit annoying. ReallyMen Here in India, a budget phone which is around 250$ are coming up with type C, fingerprint reader and they put the VoLTE feature in bold letters (because it's a new thing) and sell it. I feel type C hasn't grown much. Even the PC are taking such a long time to get them on board. M. Luciano 2015 Meloku The sad truth is, besides flagship phones in the US/Europe, not many devices use USB Type-C yet. Pointing this as a "con" is just misleading, specially for a sub-$200 Chinese smartphone. Georgi Marinov Since having a 3,5 mm audio jack on your phone is literally making you Hitler. Samarth I don't think anyone even consider buying a Meizu phone in the first place. KzX Since when having headphone jack count as a con? :3 Sruly J When did he say headphone jack is a con? Max Johnson When Apple (not Lenovo) decides you can't have it. MJ Who would even consider a phone meant for the Chinese market anyway? Is it even available in Europe? Corbin Davenport Yes, Meizu officially sells its phones online (including the M5 Note) in China, India, Israel, Europe, Brazil, and New Zealand: https://www.meizu.com/en/wheretobuy.html MJ I don't think a non-GMS Android phone will sell outside of China or India but good try Meizu. LOL Sruly J What about people who purposely don't want Google services? They're in a minority, but they still exist based on what I see on Reddit and XDA. Although it's not worth it for companies to bring their devices to the market just for this minority of users. MJ I can think of better phone options than this one could put a custom ROM on it without GApps. Regardless, my understanding is Meizu is a company actually trying to produce phones that will SELL WELL outside of China. This is NOT the way to go about it especially considering the questionable legality of the device itself. Sruly J So can I. And yeah, the things which Corbin mentioned in the article about what this phone does are just fishy. Bewear Those people are usually tech-savvy users which are more than able to install a custom ROM without flashing GApps. Sruly J I know. Besides, then they can have a great phone. Someone like that buying a phone like this just to not have GApps is laughable. Max Johnson Designing a phone to sell specifically to minorities (I mean in term of numbers, not race, so don't get sensitive) and rom flashers only is a strange marketing plan. Saying you can flash a rom to a phone to make it functional is a really bad excuse, especially when roms have issues which they usually do. Matteo Franco Meizus sold in Europe from the official source have Google services! I made a friend buy a M2 Note like 2 years and she's super happy with that :) MJ My understanding is Meizu is NOT A GSM PARTNER so if they are selling a phone with Google services on it the legality of it is in question. I assume you mean by an official source you are talking about a re-seller. They are known to to slap unofficial ROMs on Meizu phones. It's cool she likes it but personally I don't buy knockoff products. http://www.androidpolice.com/2016/12/15/an-obscure-chinese-smartphone-entering-europe-presents-a-sticky-problem-for-googles-android/ Matteo Franco I didn't read that article in particular before. That's kinda shocking... Those I was talking about are not resellers, but "official stores" that are indicated on their european website. BTW, as they state on their specs list on those "official stores" there's a pretty straightforward line affirming that phones are coming with the Play Store preinstalled (as you can see below)... It doesn't seem really correct then. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/33df4dcf05d88d283871db25ec2e111f54eb83a466914aeea809c339e15048fb.png Thomas Gladdines Indeed there wouldn't be any play services issues if you actually buy it from an official seller instead of some shady reseller that installs outdated gapps, adware and some mystery meat on it. Sruly J So... I'm getting the impression that Corbin isn't a fan of the Meizu M5 Note. Jeaninevbeck Google is paying 97$ per hour! Work for few hours and have longer with friends & family! !ud328c: On tuesday I got a great new Land Rover Range Rover from having earned $8752 this last four weeks..

Alexander Bus I hope Chinese phones get way more popular in the West just so I wouldn't have to read "It's understandable if you haven't heard of this company" in the beginning of every single review about one of them. Sruly J Except that most Chinese OEMs will never reach that accomplishment. Alexander Bus Sure, but there's two or three that stand out. Xiaomi is definitely one of them, Meizu is/was on the verge. M. Luciano I hope that they do not become more popular because they are bringing a lot of very bad Hardware with corrupted software and almost no security to these markets and they price them so cheap that people buy them because they don't know any better. I would much rather that they focus on putting out some quality devices and actually getting them up to par on the software and security front prior to releasing anything in the US. Alexander Bus >very bad Hardware with corrupted software and almost no security You buy cheap shit, you get cheap shit. Don't do that. Get a decent Xiaomi, flash your non-MIUI ROM of choice, and you've got yourself a great phone. Xiaomi Mi5 (not Mi5s) is currently a steal at ~230-250$, it's a sick 2016 flagship. m477 Even Xiaomi's bottom of the line is pretty good. Markoff LeEco phones are better value, saying it as happy owner of two Xiaomi or Zuk 2 is steal as well David Berry Id say it's hard to go wrong with a redmi pro from xiaomi . that's a nice phone for the $ & you get amoled. Meizu are like a samsung 2nd. Id rather buy an older or refurbed samsung & get the real thing. Meizus problem is explained above making it just like umi. At least meizu is going back to samsung & mtk now for their soc AsterMK Alright, I won't get into the bad hardware part because it's simply not true for any of the top Chinese OEMs, and into corrupted software because I'm not sure what that even is, but it's funny how you talk about "almost no security" when Xiaomi has the best track record for updates and security patches from any OEM. M. Luciano Xiamoi is beating Google and Blackberry? I didn't know that. But Xiaomi aside, it's only been about 10 weeks since we were reading about OEMs letting third parties access and modify their low level firmware, which resulted in back doors being created. The excuse was "it is used for customer service" and it impacted at least 2 OEMs. AsterMK Yeah they are. Even on budget devices like my Redmi Note 2 they currently have the January patch level. Those backdoors were found on none of the popular Chinese OEM. Not Xiaomi, or Huawei, or Oppo, or OnePlus, or Lenovo and Motorola. M. Luciano Huawei, ZTE and BLU. AsterMK Do you have a source for that? First time I hear about Huawei having the backdoor. M. Luciano Android Police and others from circa Nov 15th Anon lol none of those are actually verified data. even the source has not been verified by an independent 3rd party. want to know some verified ones? google for CarrierIQ. this californian company implemented backdoors into phones from apple, samsung, HTC, LG, RIM, AT&T, Sprint, Verizon. still think you are safe from these known brands? ha. What is Carrier IQ? Carrier IQ logs information about your whereabouts as well as other personal data such as browsing history, application usage and phone numbers. Carrier IQ users are unaware of the software's existence, as it runs hidden in the background and doesn't require authorized consent to function. From a permissions standpoint -- with respect to Android -- the software is capable of logging user keystrokes, recording telephone calls, storing text messages, tracking location and more. It is often difficult or impossible to disable. M. Luciano Carrier IQ is also stupid. Thankfully every phone I've ever bought has been immune to it. Lloyd Bannings Read that article again. I did a search and found no keyword about Huawei in the main article at all. ZTE and BLU, however, are on the list. Huawei is definitely on the better side in terms of quality and security control than those companies. Link: http://www.androidpolice.com/2016/11/15/security-firm-reportedly-finds-spyware-on-chinese-android-phones-including-blu-devices-sold-in-the-us/ AsterMK I didn't find anything about Huawei on those lists. David Berry I read one that mentioned huawei, zte & others. It was definitely there.i remember thinking what nexus lovers would think? I mean i don't think it makes too much difference if china or sth korea have my info.as if samsung don't sell off our info? It's just the other doors that can potentially be opened leave you vulnerabie on cheaper chinese phones Someone That's true, I own the Redmi note 4 and I got the security patch for 1.1.2017 a week ago! And the phone is perfect without any bugs that I noticed so I'm happy especially because the phone was so cheap 😀 Markoff not sure where are you from but Huawei and Lenovo are HUGE in Europe, followed by Asus and few other brands something like HTC is pretty much unknown since nobody buy it, heck even Sony would be dead if not for subsidizing with contracts Bewear Shitty iOS ripoffs? Nope. rockstarr27 Hmm not sure if I should buy this or not, review was unclear on that. Pedro Diego Fernández He basically told that it's not worth because it's not GMS partner so, you install the google apps with a third party and it may not work well and drain the battery... It's cheap, but maybe you can find some better options with little more money like a Xiaomi and wont have problems with the Gapps Markoff they recommend it since only thing they found can be easily fixed by installing clean custom ROM Corbin Davenport This phone has a Mediatek SoC, so custom ROMs will likely never happen for this. TechGuy22 mediatek you say http://s2.quickmeme.com/img/4c/4cbe603c8a9b399d005eb1a57df4ad371e8fba0f05f2e1e60c1bc8cad9317f8d.jpg CasperTFG Exact same thought every time I read specs on a new device. Giorgio Xenofonte Well, it seems an android review made by an IPHONE fan... :D Miku is Best Vocaloid Explain yourself. Jordan Palmer Not entirely sure how you came to that conclusion. Giorgio Xenofonte It is when you do a review seeing mostly what a thing does not do, instead of what it does... "OMG, where is app store? i dont like it.. it is named google play" "OMG, I cant deal with so many tweaks, roms... I just like it simple" Type-C? Meh... Design? Meizu had "iphone" design before apple Play Store? Camon, it is a chinese phone, there is no play store there... AND you can easily install gapps. This is a LOW PRICE PHONE, by a good brand... so, a good review could see all the good things the device has... not just FLYME IT :D Corbin Davenport My last iPhone was an iPhone 3G. Giorgio Xenofonte Just a metaphor. You approached the cellphone with a heavy load. AsterMK "While this is clearly designed for the Chinese market, hence the microUSB port" How are the two related? Rey Dislike of change. Many including corporations still use XP and IE6. AsterMK I guess, but you're not going to find many Type C phones at that price point in any country, not just China. Besides, China had the first USB C phone in the world. Adam Margeson Correct on the first part, but my Corp finally upgraded to Win7 about 2 years ago. Corbin Davenport As I mentioned in another comment, Type-C on phones/tablets is still rather rare in China, besides on some flagship devices. Jesus Martinez ummm, yeeeaah, USB-C isnt even common here in the US. Sure its going to start being adopted by remind me again why I should care? I have a SGS7E. and that comes with a microusb? you telling me my phone is an absolute piece of ****?? have you not read, some foreign countries/companies are suing google bevause they feel google play services are a monopoly, forcing others from not being able to install their apps. Sure, google apps are badass but if this doesnt even work eith LTE in the US, im guessing they dont really care if they sell like hotcakes here or not. also, arent people always bitching that they want a bare stock experience? sure this is a crappy ios clone ripoff, but at least they have a starting base point for less apps. and as for the camera, if people are willing to sacrifice quality and use a camera phone for everything, surely they dont care about its quality. i care, so i bought a Canon 80D and I have an expensive lens that isnt the crappy lens kit. AsterMK Not really true. China had the first USB C phone to begin with and plenty new mid rangers have it. andrew8806 Software: "There are countless issues with Flyme OS, starting with no Google services being installed by default". Battery life: "The poor implementation of Google Play Services causes the battery life to plummet, even with light use." I am confused with this statement. lol. 2×4 the implementation is poor because it is uncertified and not optimized andrew8806 Yes, but you can't say battery life is bad due to installing an application that the manufacture intended to not be installed on (not certified). If no Google services are installed on it, then installing it manually and giving poor review for battery life just doesn't make sense to me. Thats like me installing facebook on my Moto G and giving the phone a bad review because Facebook eats my battery. 2×4 yes you can because they have a GMS installer app EXPLICITLY to CIRCUMVENT GMS certification while still making GMS apps "available" andrew8806 Well that is an interesting way of implementing. Gotcha. jesuguru Fair enough, but the review correctly implies that an Android phone meant to be sold internationally (where Google services are used, unlike China) should be pre-optimized at least enough to not have battery life decimated after many users predictably install Google services on their Android phone. Renan Maybe when/if TWRP becomes avaliable to this phone, OpenGApps can be flashed? I mean, at least I think that their installation of GMS would work better. Jordan Palmer It's an MTK SoC, so I would not hold my breath. Cesar Cardoso "And while you might be right, I don't consider Android phones without the Play Store or Google Play Services to be usable at all. Searching on F-Droid for long-abandoned alternatives to my favorite applications is not a very enjoyable experience." Corbin, a rhetorical question: what about Amazon Appstore? Thomas Gladdines Sorry to say this: Actually it's a crappy review since an original Meizu phone would never ship with google services. So reviewing it based on something it doesn't have is kinda odd. The reseller probably installed the google services before he shipped the device and used some crappy outdated gapps package and didn't check if any other modifications are necessary for gapps to work properly. And to complete the party the reseller probably added some adware for fun :P The Meizu OS skin is actually pretty nice in my opinion, it's very different from stock indeed but there's great attention to detail and has some interesting additions. And this is a budget Meizu device from around $100 so it's obviously has a Mediatek soc, compared to high end Meizu phones with an Exynos soc. Corbin Davenport The phone was sent as a review unit from Meizu, not a reseller. flipp0 Factory reset the phone and install Google services again. Also, make sure that you have the lastest firmware installed. I have owned several Meizu phones and every one of them had great battery life (with Google play installed). My name is…. Why do you even review non Google devices? I already know AndroidPolice people is gonna shit on it, you guys are a joke. Steve Crap article based off a review unit. Buy it from AliExpress and basically everything you read in this article is crap. Got mine a week ago and it's running flyme 6.0 with google services pre installed - via the seller. Haven't had a single crash or issue in the week I have owned it. Battery life is on par with my 7 plus and get 2 days out of it. Diogo Neves Two friends of mine own the thing and they have nothing but great things to say. Amazing battery life even with the GMS installed and amazing performance for the price. Can't agree with this review. Try another unit before you bash the product for flaws that not everyone has. Steve McQueen SOLD! Rawhi Mohammad Meizu probably didn't pay AP enough this time. Alexis Barrientos 7.0 in January 2017... Not 6.0 Martin Only if they was judging the other OEMs that are releasing phones with problems and lack of updates... ! But of course liking Google's a** pays the bills I guess.. :) Tin My Meizu M1 note is still going strong after nearly 2 years of abuse. The battery still endures 1 day easily. I usually do web browsing 3-4-5 hours a day. Still 40-50% of battery left when I plug to charger at night. LG G3 could not hold charge that long. My wife's redmi note2 as well does not hold charge that long after 6-7 months. They have similar capacity battery of 3000 mAh. Flyme is brilliant if you are used to. I find it easier and quicker to use than usual android 3 buttons in LG and Xaiomi. Gesture wake up is briliant. I do not need to use power button at all. Google play installation is a breeze. I use Google Now as home screen so I do not have all the app icons on the screen. I got bored and bought mi max last month. It is too big and not very practical for daily use. Now I switched back to my M1 note. Dmitry Stepanushkin nice title. lol Vivek Rameses No Google services is a great fucking thing. That should be the selling point. Régis Knechtel "With a 4,000mAh battery, I was expecting at least a noticeable increase in battery life over my Nexus 5X"...."I did not see more than three hours of screen-on-time". Well, I don't know if there's something wrong with my Nexus 5X, but I've NEVER got more than 3 hours of screen-on time. It's usually just 2.5 h :( SE.Quence sot depending on your pattern of use, preferred network (wifi/lte) and so on. Greater improvement I got after reflashing to custom ROM. AQ Have you considered that the google apps you installed from this questionable & unofficial source might be maliciously modified & that is whats draining the battery like mad? Corbin Davenport As mentioned in the article and another comment, the GMS installed is made by Meizu, was found the in the Meizu-developed 'Hot Apps', and was recommended for use to us by a Meizu representative. It's as official as it gets, unfortunately. AQ Oh, I missed the part of "former" in the article, I just read it as both pointing to a sketchy third party. John Liu I think most of your problems are caused by the GMS, including the battery problem SE.Quence Moreover, no Qualcomm SoCs, mostly MTK with weak graphics, always locked bootloader so no any custom ROMs, no FM-radio, no IR remote and so on compared to his rival Xiaomi Redmi 3 Pro based on Snapdragon 650 with stronger performance and battery life. Kostas 💪🎩 It's nice seeing reviews of devices from chinese manufacturers. Considering this author's background with development, it would be nice to also see a personal note at the end of the article, regarding 3rd party development support of the device. Corbin Davenport It should run all Android 6.0-compatible apps. likurges god what I would give to have this skin or at least make my nexus 5 look like this. I don't give a shit if it look like an iphone clone or something, I find it to be one of the prettiest looking skins of android. It's just so clean and slick. Yeah I know the software itself is crap, but they can improve! Corbin Davenport Yeah, the UI itself isn't half bad. Certainly better than some of the other skins I've seen. Rob I wouldn't dare signing in to my main Google account on that phone. Did you (I suppose you did)? Moose Shame that the reviewer had such a bad experience with this phone. I have tried two Meizu phones in recent years - the budget M2 Note and the Pro 5. The former came with a global ROM so had no Chinese apps. Google services were already there. I had no problems with this phone, great battery life although the SOC was a bit laggy and the screen was a fingerprint magnet. However, the Pro 5 was a real flagship. Still I had to install Google services myself and the installed apps were all in Chinese and I got some Chinese notifications occasionally. But it was speedy and had fantastic battery life, plus no problems with anything. One thing I really loved about both these phones was the one-touch on the home button to go back so no need for a separate back button. And you could swipe up from the bottom to show recent apps, very convenient. (Lenovo's Zuk phones work in a similar way). I generally like Meizu phones, my only wish is that they would stop using underwhelming Mediatek processors. Now that they have resolved their differences with Qualcomm maybe we will see some improvement in this area. 1977Rider The problem with notifications happens with my meizu M3 (a.k.a Meizu m3 mini) and M3s, they dont appear until you open the app (whatsapp, as a example). I have the same problems you described (Im brazilian, imported my phones from aliexpress). Pokemon go runs on my M3s (with log in problens) but dont work on M3 mini. The notification problems seems "better" when i uninstalled Gapps, but that F***** my experience with the phones... Argh Flipp0 I have had problems with whatsapp notifications on both Meizu M2 Note and Meizu Max. But I managed to fix both of them. On M2 Note I rooted the phone and uninstalled security manager. On Meizu Max I whitelites whats app in the battery and ram settings and disabled linked launch is settings: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEeMTnFk0Ns Bohari Japar I consider myself a Meizu fan after purchasing MX6 last year. A year before that I got myself Nexus 5x (small upgrade from Nexus 5), all I can say is, Ive never been more impressed. Its really cheap. But, I had to get rooted, extract opengapps and placed all the googliess apk manually because flashing the gapps zip files can be a bit tricky. Right now it feels very good. Markoff so your only complaint is that you don't know how to install custom ROM? because i don't see any provided reason why to not buy this phone in article besides complaining that you are lazy to replace ROM with clean custom ROM like Lineage Flipp0 I don't think custom roms is available for M5 Note but the newest firmware version is available here (both Flyme 5 Stable and Flyme 6 Beta): https://forum.meizufans.eu/category/144/meizu-m5-note Flipp0 Poor review. Countless people use this phone with Google Play and no battery life problems at all. You either got a defective unit or something went wrong with Google Play on your device. Factory reset the phone and install Google Play again. When it comes to missing notfications, I am sure that you can solve this issue by tweaking the power management settings. BIG IMPACT ENT This may sound crazy but..does anybody here have an android phone they need to get rid of?..wouldn't mind sending it to Africa. I am enthusiastic about but phones here aren't that affordable, not especially for people in school. Santiago Boscolo Wow a really good review!! Have you seen the agm a2? Eric "Disclaimer: Since Meizu is not a registered Google Services partner, the international M5 Note comes without Google's services preinstalled. Instead, the phone gives you access to an installer which installs them for you hassle free. Other reviewers have been pointing out that these, essentially sideloaded, Google apps and services drain the battery faster than usual, but we assure you this behavior was only found on the reviewers units, which were sent out running an earlier pre-production version of the ROM. With the latest software build we've been enjoying great battery life." - GSM Arena mf1gt3r This review seems biased. Simtopia23 Android Police = no Google implementations? don't buy it!! I've seen and read most of your reviews, and your reviews are misleading and bashing against chinese phones. Don't pretend every Android user uses the full suite of Google apps because i can tell you, this is not the case even in many countries in EU. RIZA YILMAZ Is this website working under Apple's sponsorship? I am using m5 note and device has no battery or performance issues. This is a cheap middle level phone. What are you waiting for? Alex This put simply, is a bad review. I wasn't expecting to be blown away, but the annoyances are not worth the reading... First of all, you cannot compare the weight of a 5.5" budget phone to a 5.0" flagship device. The Google Picel XL which has thas the same screen size weights only 7 grams less. I own a Meizu phone with Flyme OS and it definitely does not cripple the phone. It actually runs smooth and GMS work completely fine. I could go on. Review a unit that is not designated for the chinese market and you will not have these problems... vanaja best post http://www.selfcarinsurance.com Follow Android Police 1.49M 471k 144k 116k Latest Deals 14 [Deal Alert] Several movies and TV episodes on Google Play are on sale for Memorial Day 2017/05/27 6:37pm PDTMay 27, 2017 4 [Deal Alert] Get a 3-pack Arlo Pro security system for $450 ($130 off), if you have Amazon Prime 2017/05/27 12:04pm PDTMay 27, 2017 15 [Deal Alert] Two 6' USB-C to USB-C cables $5 at Amazon w/coupon ($7 off) 2017/05/27 10:52am PDTMay 27, 2017 2 [Deal alert] Get the previous-gen 7" Amazon Fire tablet for $39.99 ($10 off) 2017/05/27 9:52am PDTMay 27, 2017 50 [Update: Now $75 Off] Deal Alert: Pixel 32GB (international version) is $50 off on eBay 2017/05/26 2:20pm PDTMay 26, 2017 Latest Poll Do you use a screen protector on your phone?

Google Maps v9.54 prepares to add saved locations for your school and gym, notification channels, and what looks like a task list [APK Teardown] Cody Toombs Follow View All Posts 2017/05/26 6:22am PDTMay 26, 2017 38 Plus 1 on G+ 65 Share on Facebook 51 Share on Twitter Total Shares103 APK Teardown Applications Downloads What's Really New Article Contents 1 Teardown 1.1 Saved locations for School and Gym 1.2 The 'Other' Notification Channel 1.3 A few new prompts 1.4 A task list called "Nearby Need?" 2 Download An update to Google Maps v9.54 began rolling out to users through the beta channel yesterday, but it doesn't appear to have any visible changes going live quite yet. However, a teardown of the apk does bring a few hints about what to expect in the future. There are clues about a couple of new saved destinations like the Home and Work slots that have become so useful, the first stirring of support for Android O's notification channels, a few new "promos" to get people interested in various features, and a very curious feature that might turn out to be a task list of sorts. As usual, we've got a link at the bottom to download this update to sideload if you're not interested in waiting for Google to deliver it to your device. Teardown Disclaimer: Teardowns are based on evidence found inside of apks (Android's application package) and are necessarily speculative and usually based on incomplete information. It's possible that the guesses made here are totally and completely wrong. Even when predictions are correct, there is always a chance that plans could change or may be canceled entirely. Much like rumors, nothing is certain until it's officially announced and released. The features discussed below are probably not live yet, or may only be live for a small percentage of users. Unless stated otherwise, don't expect to see these features if you install the apk. Saved locations for School and Gym If you find yourself regularly using the Home and Work saved locations for quick navigation, you'll enjoy this one. The Maps team is expanding the list to include two more common destinations: your gym and your school. <string name="GYM_LOCATION">Gym</string> <string name="SCHOOL_LOCATION">School</string> Since those two strings don't really include any specific telltale signs that they're intended to be default saved locations, I've included the two previously existing lines for Home and Work for comparison. It's pretty obvious that the naming convention matches up. <string name="HOME_LOCATION">Home</string> <string name="WORK_LOCATION">Work</string> There is also a newly added icon for education, which I would naturally assume will go with the School destination. There doesn't appear to be a similar icon dedicated to the Gym slot, but it's not as if Google can't easily color-fill the existing fitness icon. Nevertheless, this one missing icon might be a hint that Google won't make these new destination slots available until a future update includes the missing icon. These two new entries will obviously operate just like Home and Work for the purposes of navigation and quick route selection. And as always, users don't have to actually link these slots to real schools or gyms. I'm sure a lot of people will welcome this simple improvement because so many of us travel to more than just work and home in a typical day. The 'Other' Notification Channel I'll just make a quick mention of this topic since it's not really that interesting. Google Maps is going to have a notification channel on Android O titled "Other notifications." <string name="OTHER_NOTIFICATION_CHANNEL">Other notifications</string> I doubt this will be the only custom channel for Maps. After all, there are several subsections in Settings dedicated to each notification type, so we'll probably see the channel list grow a fair amount in the future. I would assume the Maps team is still trying to decide how to best organize the app's notifications. This "other" channel will probably become a placeholder for most of the notifications until they are organized into suitable channels. A few new prompts I normally skip changes that are meant to advertise existing features, but sometimes the focus of banners and notifications can give a little insight into the features and apps that may not be performing as well as expected or simply need user awareness. The latest Maps update includes three new promos. The first banner is for the Google Trips app. Launched around this time last year, Trips is basically an itinerary management app that's also intended for making local recommendations. Trips probably doesn't have a very substantial user base yet, so it's not hard to imagine why Google is trying to breathe a little more life into it. code <string name="OFFLINE_MAPS_TRIPS_APP_BANNER_TITLE">Take your travel info with you</string> <string name="OFFLINE_MAPS_TRIPS_APP_BANNER_TITLE_WITH_AREA_NAME">Take your %1$s travel info with you</string> <string name="OFFLINE_MAPS_TRIPS_APP_BANNER_BODY">Reservations • Things to do • Day plans</string> <string name="OFFLINE_MAPS_TRIPS_APP_BANNER_DOWNLOAD_LINK">Get Google Trips app</string> <string name="OFFLINE_MAPS_TRIPS_APP_BANNER_DISMISS_LINK">No thanks</string> The next addition is intended to get users to try out the recently launched location sharing feature. It's pretty normal to show prompts to get users only newly released features, so there's nothing unusual about this one, but you can probably expect to see it in your navigation setup soon. code <string name="CAR_TI TLE_JOURNEY_SHARING">Share journey</string> <string name="JOURNEY_SHARING_PENDING_PROMPT_TEXT">Share your trip with %1$s</string> <string name="JOURNEY_SHARING_PENDING_PROMPT_TTS">Sharing your real-time location with %1$s until you arrive.</string> <string name="CAR_MENU_START_JOURNEY_SHARING">Share journey</string> <string name="CAR_MENU_STOP_JOURNEY_SHARING">Stop sharing</string> The final promotional banner will belong to the always familiar Local Guides program. As usual, it's going to encourage users to contribute to Maps for points. The one interesting oddity is that these strings have "v2" in their names. It's possible this just means they are for a new set of promos, or this might hint at a revised version of the points program. I would expect the former, but it's at least worth acknowledging the latter is possible. code <string name="POINTS_V2_PROMO_TITLE">Reach new Local Guides levels</string> <string name="POINTS_V2_PROMO_TEXT">Now earn more points for your reviews, photos, edits, and adding new places.</string> <string name="POINTS_V2_PROMO_GOTO_STATS">SEE YOUR LEVEL</string> <string name="POINTS_V2_PROMO_OPEN_HELP">Learn more</string> A task list called "Nearby Need?" There's very little to go on for this topic, but it looks just weird enough that I suspect there's a feature brewing in there somewhere. A pair of new layouts were added with the name "nearby need," one of which defines the look of a list, and the other is for items in that list. There is also a single string with a related name and just the word "navigate" for text. <string name="NEARBY_NEED_NAVIGATE">Navigate</string> /layout/nearby_need_item.xml /layout/nearby_need.xml Based on this very limited amount of information, it does sound a little like a shopping list of sorts. Perhaps less like a grocery list and more like a list of chores or tasks – e.g. getting new tires on the car, picking up some materials for a weekend project, and buying new clothes. I would assume each item goes into a list and Google Maps will make it easy to navigate to the next nearest place where each of these things can be taken care of. I'm not actually sure if these are related, but there are also three new images to be found in the resources, and they certainly would fit with my theory. The first is for creating new tasks, the second is for completed tasks, and the final one is for "old" completed tasks. I suppose the old one might be for things a user did on previous days but hasn't removed from the list. This is all guesswork right now, but many people have been asking for ways to use Maps to get through chores, and this feels like the first hint of something like that. The one aspect that's not yet hinted at, but I certainly hope to see, is a feature that will sort tasks efficiently so people can choose the shortest (or fastest) route to get everything done. I'll keep watching and follow up when there are more developments.

They are used when you go to Your Contributions -> Check the Facts/Uncover Missing info. I think after all this time those two are still only for lvl 5 local guides... so yeah. Cody Toombs Right, the look of the images aren't new, but the files containing those images are. Or said more clearly, there are now multiple copies of those icons. mmark27 I sure would like there to be a "Work" and then a "Parking for Work" section for those that don't park right next to their office. Point being, if I want walking direction/estimations, give them from my office. If I want driving directions/estimations on time, know that I have to walk to my car, then drive from my parking location. The School addition will be good to finally have pop up automatically now though. Cody Toombs If you're not going to use all four slots for their intended purpose, you might just assign one of the others to be your work parking. Frankly, I would have liked these saved slots to have custom labels, since some people don't fit into this one shape. For example, I know somebody that has to travel to two different sites for the same job, and another friend that was enrolled in two different schools at the same time. It's not like one of these destinations can't go into the "Gym" slot, but it would be nice if the titles could make sense. mmark27 Right. I now have my "Work" location saved as my parking lot, which is silly, but it's the only way to get decent estimations. Your fix is what I'll be doing otherwise unless they fix it. The subtly though in this situation is El Goog knowing that the Work and Work Parking are linked existentially, so they can decipher where my body is and estimate from there, etc. Same can be said for Home and Home Parking if not directly on site. Would seem like Google's apartment-city-dwelling-first mentality would be more amenable to this off the bat. I agree that we should be able to have free labels on places and also as many places as we can stomach estimations/notifications on time to. Google knows where I am at all times....make it actually useful, guys. henleyb I work from home and Google would keep asking me to set my work address which is of course the same as my home address, it was a small but annoying thing. :) Austin Spangrud Sure would be nice if maps got integrated assistant into it. None of the commands and home commands that I have integrate with the Voice button in maps. Oh and In b4 where's my speed limit pop up Cody Toombs Speed limits are still limited geographically. Since I was in the Bay Area last week, I finally saw them pop up for the first time on my phone and in Android Auto. Funny enough, I now have a Speed Limit toggle in settings on one phone, but nowhere else :/ And now I'm probably not going to see the speed limits again for a long time. Paul_Werner Yeah and we used to have them and they disappeared. At least it did for me here in the Milwaukee, WI area. Same for when I travel to Chicago Nicholas Matranga Finally, it was so annoying to have to save my school address as my work address just to get commute updates. mike shwilly Grow up Hamilton Jimenez Vasquez Finally, Im glad that we can save more pinned-saved choices other than the usual Home and Work, although I would prefer to customize them on my own in the same manner we customize the saved list. I could make a really good use of few in my mind like Church, Work2, University, etc. Jon Xuereb Couldn't you use this school one for University Hamilton Jimenez Vasquez I used the word University just an example, the point is that it would be great to customize those pinned saves using our own creations. Taylor Hardy I work from comfort and ease of my property or home, through doing easy gigs that only takes from you a Computer and web connection and I am also joyful than before... After six months time in this project and also i got made in sum 36,000 usd... Basically I make near 80 bucks/hr and work for three to four hours every day.And excellent point relating to this work is that you can easily handle time and effort while you work and for how long as you prefer and you generate a paycheck per week........ learn by clicking here how to do it right now Paul_Werner I can't wait to see that "nearby need" implemented. Your guesswork on it sounds like it could be a really useful feature. h4rr4r Why are these static names? Why can't I add random strings and assign them saved locations? Ken Vincent what ever happened to speed limits? I thought that was on the verge of being a thing more then a year ago. UKTK8 "In the coming weeks" Meaning whenever Google d#$% well pleases. Jon Xuereb Lawyers I'm assuming dmo580 Yet Waze and other GPS apps have no issues. How about just displaying my current speed? Ken Vincent Not only that, but google provides speed limits as a service. I would imagine that is where Waze gets their speed limit info. https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/roads/speed-limits Jon Xuereb Because Google Maps is exponentially larger in terms of user base, and google is a bigger target for lawsuits Ken Vincent Waze is wholly owned by Google. They are not even an Alphabet company, they are Google. Jon Xuereb Still the size of the userbase affects the their risk assessment icyhotmike why not just let us add "Saved" locations such as Home and Work and whatever else we want? Damn Google in control of everything. makapav My God the Google apps and ecosystem are becoming such a clusterfuck with no sources of truth for data points. All the information is spread across random places. Richard Oldroyd I do use home a lot but for the others like gym I save as a contact and nav just as quick. Richard Oldroyd I'd love maps to display my current speed and advise what the speed limit is. Obviously they would have to add a warning saying they can not be held responsible for displaying an incorrect speed limit. I'd also like to see us be able to choose what is displayed underneath where they show destination time and miles to go, it would be useful to see arrival times at all stops not just the one you are currently naving to.

Generate Enquiries for your Business by Listing on Economictimes.com List Your Business Find Service Near You By Sreeraman Thiagarajan Looks like Google I/O, their annual developer conference is now likely to stay at their backyard at Shoreline Amphitheatre as opposed to Moscone center in San Francisco where eight of their previous conferences were held. Shoreline Amphitheatre is an open-air venue in the pacific coast of California with abundant sun shine, and Google's CEO Sundar Pichai opened the keynote by urging the 7000 plus members present to apply the sunscreen liberally and declared ''it's on us". The #io17 keynote was two-part series and long enough that we had a lunch break in between; there was a whole bunch of announcements made to please two types of people who matter to Google the most - Developers and Consumers. Gone are the tactics of skydiving glass wearers and giving away of a bounty of laptops and smartphones to attendees. After 18 years since inception, Google has now sobered up and it is a bit boring when I realized they are losing their child like enthusiasm. Nevertheless, they have aged well, and this year's IO clearly focused on driving home one message 'Mobile first world to AI first world'. Here is how they did it. Bragging and show of strength: While Android has crossed two billion users, six other Google products enjoy a billion plus users every month, they are Search, Gmail, Chrome, YouTube, Maps, and Play Store. Pichai and his clique proudly demonstrated how machine learning and AI are being integrated into their products for transitioning from a mobile first world to a AI first world. Gmail gets Smart Replies, something that is borrowed from their messaging app Allo. Upcoming Android O gets Smart Text selection which automatically differentiates between a phone number and a postal address when you select a text, Android phones are now fortified with Google Play Protect, which uses machine learning to scan one billion devices and 50 billion apps each day to protect its users from malware and it even helps in finding lost phones. Pichai also emphasized how voice and image has become an important mode of computing and even showed off a chart that claims their algorithm has lower error rate than humans in terms of image recognition. This was quickly followed by announcement of Google Lens for Assistant, which essentially uses smartphone camera as an input device and reduces the need to search through typing text or giving voice commands. Each of the above is made possible by deploying Machine learning and AI at scale through their advanced TPU deployed on Google cloud. TPU or tensor processing units are much faster and powerful than normal CPU and GPU. By deploying them on cloud and making it accessible for everyone, Google thinks every developer can build next generation products. Collectively they call this as 'Google.ai' which is an ensemble of tools, efforts and research that aims to bring the benefits of AI to everyone. Some of the applied AI areas from Google.AI transcend way beyond just making Google products smarter. From DNA sequencing to helping pathologist diagnose cancer better, Google.AI is on a poignant journey to make the world a better place. With such profound application of technology, the atmosphere around the keynote hit a crescendo of drama but Sundar swiftly brought the geeky mood back by showing a light-hearted application called AutoDraw which uses applied AI to convert our scribbles of a cat into an actual cat drawing. Digital inclusion: Not to be confused with reaching and including people at grassroots level, here we are talking about Google being inclusive of first world citizens and Apple fans. The most compelling use case of AI to make an average users' life better is through Google Assistant. The chatty, natural language assistant that aims to help us in real world was launched during io16 for Google Home and subsequently introduced for Pixel phones, it is now available for iPhone. On both Android and iPhone, Google Assistant will now work in French, German, Brazilian Portuguese and Japanese. And coming soon are Italian, Spanish and Korean But that's not all. Google just opened the Assistant SDK for developers and OEM of any apps and electronic appliances to be Google Assistant compatible. They have already worked with leading consumer appliances brand including LG, Bang & Olufsen, Sony among others and these products are hitting the shelf soon. With this, you can ask your smartphone to turn the AC on or play music in home audio system. Besides Assistant coming to iPhone, Daydream VR is coming to headsets from partners including HTC and Lenovo which will not require a smartphone or PC to power the user's VR experience. Users just put the headsets on and it works. They work on a principle Google calls as 'WorldSense' which is powered by technology from its Tango AR system. Attracting the next billion users: India alone added over 100 million people online last year - this is the highest growth among any country in the world. Google tried to woo Indians with Android One, a bunch of low cost devices launched during 2015, but they did not do very well. Google is now taking off from exactly where they left off from Android One, this time with a strategy that stems from software, an OS called Android Go, and not through price controls through affordable or cheap hardware /smartphones. Google announced Android Go at this IO, a modified OS spinoff from its latest Android O. Android Go is poised to work on cheap smartphones with less than 512MB of RAM and comprises a rebuilt set of Google apps such as YouTube Go, a new leaner version of Google Play Store and more. It is interesting and amusing to see how Google promotes both web and apps, two opposing tech philosophies in same measure. While Android GO helps in delivering leaner apps, Progressive Web Apps and Accelerated Mobile Page (PWA & AMP respectively) helps have better web experiences even in 2G connections and slower devices. While io16 saw Flipkart lite demo their PWA site that even works offline, this year we saw representatives of Ola on stage who booked a cab using PWA which uses just 0.5MB of data on a web browser and requires no app download, as opposed to a 100MB of space Ola app occupies on IOS or 60MB on Android. Pichai also briefly mentioned about how Google Translate is now using neural machine translation technology to translate between English and nine widely used Indian languages in a more accurate way. Beside the keynote, there were dedicated sessions and talks to win in India where internet based products cannot expect continuous internet connectivity! Strengthening their ad business: By knowing their consumers well. Nearly 90% of Google's revenue till date comes from advertising revenues. They are the world's leading media company and in second slot comes Facebook. Facebook has its social graph which plainly knows what places, brands, events and people their consumers 'likes' and who are they related to and how they feel about a given topic. Armed with this information they can show more relevant ads that delivers better ROI for their paying customers. Google lacks such a social graph until now. Microsoft acquired LinkedIn and the benefits of knowing how people are connected and behave in a professional context will lead in huge accrual of insights for a company creating and selling productivity products. Understanding connections and relations between people is where Google has a chink in the armor and they are fixing it in an amazing way with Google Photos and Home - both products work in a way that connects individual users to their friends and family. Let Google learn about 'us' than just know about me basis what I searched or browsed. Google photos has over 500 million users who upload billion of pictures every day and this IO they launched a feature called 'Suggested Sharing' which nudges a user to share pictures with friends or family who is in the picture captured by the user. Another feature announced is the 'Shared Libraries' which can automatically send and receive relevant photos between two contacts. Now imagine the possibilities of creating a contextual understanding of each of its user as a connection to another user. There it is, Google photo is Google's own social graph; and they are taking this so seriously that have launched a physical photo book printing service called 'Photo Books' in US. It starts at $9.99 and all the IO attendees get a photo book for free. Sure, why not start with the developer community to test the new social graph. Though Google does not talk about its enterprise and business solutions such as AdWords or Analytics in IO, it does a follow up event called Marketing Next where new updates and products features that matter to advertiser are announced. Everything else: We saw was not new bets like Allo or Duo that took on competition like last year, but a bunch of innovations that would keep Google on top the game they are already good at. YouTube supports 360-degree video on connected TVs, content creators and artistes get additional means to generate revenue through Super Chat, a feature where fans can pay for their comment to be pinned and highlighted during a live performance on YouTube. The developer community in the amphitheater cheered with an intensity that would shame soccer hooligans when Kotlin, a new age programming language, was declared as officially supported for Android! With Daydream, Google is pushing the boundaries of VR. Not only are the taking smartphone out of the VR headsets but are also making it more useful than just entertainment and games. A new navigational concept called VPS or Virtual Positioning Service was announced, it is an advanced VR based navigation that accurately works in indoor spaces. In the demo video, we saw how VPS can help you find a right tool at the aisle in a massive shopping store. As a conclusion when Pichai came back to stage, he announced the biggest incremental feature that Google Search has ever got - Google for Jobs. A Google's take on simplifying job search for both blue and white collars across skills and experience. They are doing this in collaboration with LinkedIn, Facebook, Monster among others and of course it uses Machine learning to make the job hunt easy for users. Google has realized the shift from mobile to AI, it is not only reimagining each of its product to stay ahead of the curve but is also urging developers to join the journey. The restraint displayed in not launching any more me too products as challengers unlike previous years says volumes about a matured leadership. Every new feature or innovation they are working on ultimately leading to better advertising solution and thus increased revenue is a masterclass in business strategy; something that many new age, cash-burning startups can learn from. After all, greatest innovation happens through collaborations and we see them in plenty at a developer conference aptly names IO which stands for 'innovation in the open'.

PHOTO: AFP A total of 34 artificial intelligence startups were acquired in the first quarter of this year, more than twice the amount of activity in the year-ago quarter, according to the research firm CB Insights. Tech giants seeking to reinforce their leads in artificial intelligence or make up for lost ground have been the most aggressive buyers. Alphabet Inc’s Google has acquired 11 AI startups since 2012, the most of any firm, followed by Apple Inc, Facebook Inc and Intel Corp, respectively, according to CB Insights. The companies declined to comment on their acquisition strategies. A spokesman for Apple did confirm the company’s recent purchase of Lattice Data, a startup that specializes in working with unstructured data. The first quarter also saw one of the largest deals to date as Ford Motor Co invested $1 billion in Argo AI, founded by former executives on self-driving teams at Google and Uber Technologies Inc. The next revolution: artificial intelligence Startups are looking to go deep on applications of artificial intelligence to specific fields, such as health and retail, industry observers say, rather than compete directly with established companies. “What you will see is very big players will build platform services, and startup communities will migrate more to applied intelligent apps,” said Matt McIlwain, managing director of Madrona Venture Group. Healthcare startup Forward, for example, is using artificial intelligence to crunch data that can inform doctors’ recommendations. “For people who really want to focus on core AI problems, it makes a lot of sense to be in bigger companies,” said Forward Chief Executive Officer Adrian Aoun, who previously worked at Google. “But for folks who really want to prove a new field, a new area, it makes more sense to be separate.” Artificial intelligence companies that do remain independent field a steady stream of suitors: Matthew Zeiler, chief executive of Clarifai, which specializes in image and video recognition, said he has been approached about a dozen times by prospective acquirers since starting the company in late 2013. Toyota to use Nvidia’s AI technology for self-driving cars Clarifai’s pitch to customers such as consumer goods company Unilever Plc and hotel search firm Trivago is bolstered by its narrow focus on artificial intelligence. “(Google) literally competes with almost every company on the planet,” Zeiler said. “Are you going to trust them with being your partner for AI?” Tech giants have been locked in a bidding war for academics specializing in artificial intelligence. Startups rarely have the capital to compete, but a company with a specialized mission can win over recruits, said Vic Gundotra, chief executive of AliveCor, which makes an AI-driven portable heart monitor. “They say, ‘I want to come here and work on a project that might save my mother’s life,’” Gundotra said.

PhoneDog Android And Me TodaysiPhone NEW Call T-Mobile at (855) 668-8976 TmoNews Unofficial T-Mobile Blog, News, Videos, Articles and more Navigation Home Submit News 700MHz LTE map Upcoming Phones HOT TOPICS: Samsung Galaxy Note 7 LG V20 Google Pixel Extended Range LTE Android 7.0 Nougat You are here: Home > T-Mobile offers to pay for Verizon switchers’ phones, two-lines-for-one deal also coming T-Mobile offers to pay for Verizon switchers’ phones, two-lines-for-one deal also coming May 24, 2017 Alex Wagner 96 Comments Yesterday T-Mobile CEO John Legere teased that T-Mo had multiple announcements coming up, and today a couple of them have been made. Starting May 31st, T-Mobile will kick off its #GetOutoftheRed promotion to help Verizon customers switch to T-Mo. Verizon customers in good standing with their carrier can get their iPhone or Google Pixel paid off by T-Mobile when they switch to T-Mobile and sign up for T-Mobile One, and they can keep their existing device. The phones that qualify for this promotion include the iPhone SE, iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, Google Pixel, and Google Pixel XL. T-Mobile says that these devices were selected because “phones need certain software to be globally compatible, and some phones don’t yet have that software.” Magenta does say that it’s working with unspecified device makers to make more phones compatible with this promotion. Additionally, Verizon customers switching to T-Mobile must add T-Mo’s Premium Device Protection Plus insurance plan to their device to qualify. This insurance plan costs $15 per month and includes protection against loss, theft, and accidental damage, McAfee ID Protection, McAfee Content Protection, and other features. T-Mobile says that it’ll pay Verizon customers that take advantage of this promotion with a digital prepaid MasterCard card that typically arrives within 15 days. While this #GetOutoftheRed promotion is focused on Verizon customers (because VZW phones are unlocked), T-Mobile is doing something for AT&T and Sprint subscribers, too. Starting on May 31st, AT&T and Sprint customers can switch to T-Mobile and get their existing device paid off when they buy a new phone from T-Mobile on EIP. And unlike Carrier Freedom, those customers won’t be forced to trade in their existing device. Finally, T-Mobile says that starting tomorrow, May 25th, T-Mobile One customers with at least two voice lines can get two additional lines of service for the price of one. The cost of the second line will be offset by a bill credit.

(J²) Right… I’d found that the system doesn’t consistently apply these. TylerCameron Yeah their billng process it’s horrible Steve_NYC So true. I actually considered moving to the T-Mobile One Plan even though it would have cost me more money, just to get away from the insanity of their bill credit process. I finally got things straightened out, but I am sure it will be a problem in the future. It’s gotten to the point that I think it’s deliberate. Mike I had a free line from November that I had to call in every month. to get credit. They finally fixed it to be automatic this month. best part I got extra bill credits for months since last November and my bill is now negative so I didn’t have to make a payment this month. Al William So in order to get the free line, you need to have at least a total of 4 voice lines? Corey Jalette You need to have 2 voice lines to get this promo, which you get 2 lines for the price of 1. So in total you end up woth 4 lines, 1st 2 have to be voice, the 2 you’re adding could be whatever you want. So if you’re on the 2/100 plan right now if you add 2 tablets it would be 120 a month (20 per tablet but 1 is free) or if you add 2 voice lines it would be 140 (40 for adding a 3rd line then 4th is free) Al William Thanks for the clarification! So minimum 2 voice lines and the other 2 could be voice or data. I just wish they get rid of these bill credits. Sometimes it’s such a nightmare. Corey Jalette It can be yes but that’s how pretty much everything is done. Just like they had a free line deal in march it’s listed on my account as a free line on us but I still get the charge on my bill, but it’s auto credited. The only time it wasn’t was the first month because I added it before the end of the billing cycle. Cost $49 but they also credited my account manually that one time. Haven’t had an issue since. AWasserberg7 This article mentions Magenta. What *is* Magenta? Is that some cute term of affection for T-Mobile? kev2684 Are you serious? It’s their brand color. VZW = Red AT&T = Blue T-Mobile = Magenta Sprint = Yellow Nobody Special Cricket (umm, green) lol Genecio MetroPCS= Purple Black&Orange= Boost The Waz Just confirmed by T-Force that if you have a 2 for 100 plus a “this ones on us promo” giving you total 3 lines, you will lose your free line if you take advantage of the promotion of 2 for 1 tomorrow. They stated that they have to move you to a different Tmobile One plan….makes no sense since there is only 1 plan…… Corey Jalette This is ONLY if you’re adding a voice line people. If you’re adding tablet/smartwatch/mobile Internet plans that doesn’t affect your phone plan promo of 2/100. Corey Jalette Add 2 tablets with unlimited data on your plan for $20/month. They frequently have a free tablet promo with qualifying data plan. Snatch those up and you’re golden. The Waz Yes this will affect both. IF you have the 2 for 100 and the “this one is on us” free line….you will lose both promotions…confirmed with t force and John directly. Ben Also why can’t the t force reps do this. Seems very simple. chnage to the 4 plan rate, open the C-2 documentation, search this one on us, ask supervisor to open the page, enter the code on my account to reflect the 4th line as being free. And then add the 1 for 2 lines, or 50 percent off a one more line. This way I keep hookup and this one on us promo. and also eligible for future lines down the road. Yea this is very strange Ben Also why can’t the t force reps do this. Seems very simple. chnage to the 4 plan rate, open the C-2 documentation, search this one on us, ask supervisor to open the page, enter the code on my account to reflect the 4th line as being free. And then add the 1 for 2 lines, or 50 percent off a one more line. This way I keep hookup and this one on us promo. and also eligible for future lines down the road. So yea im wondering is anyone can find a loophole or something Andrew Singleton the reason is that you’re on a 2-line promotional plan paying $20 less than everyone else, and you’ve added a line. since you’re unable to add another line on that plan, you are forced to switch to a 3+ line plan, and that will cause activation-related discounts to drop. Corey below is correct, because internet lines (tablet, watch, syncup drive) are their own rate plan and don’t affect your voice configuration. Ben Also why can’t the t force reps do this. Seems very simple. chnage to the 4 plan rate, open the C-2 documentation, search this one on us, ask supervisor to open the page, enter the code on my account to reflect the 4th line as being free. And then add the 1 for 2 lines, or 50 percent off a one more line. This way I keep hookup and this one on us promo. and also eligible for future lines down the road. J Gerard Yeah! Let’s switch to T-MOBILE because we want to not be able to make phone calls half the time, and not have a signal to look something up when we actually need it. Oh yeah, and to not be able to upload pictures of something fun that we’re doing until we’re at home connected to WiFi later that night or the next day. Before any of you “magenta” fans TRIES to defend them… I’ve been a Verizon customer for about 12 years except for 6 months last year, when I switched because of crappy TMobile’s cheap prices and convincing (misleading) advertising. It was HORRIBLE. I used to get pissed and call them to ask why I could never get a signal. After 6 months, I finally admitted to myself that it was a ridiculous mistake and switched back to The Red! NEVER any issues with Verizon’s service. Never. “Magenta” is only good at talking a big game. If anyone’s thinking about switching to T-Mobile, DON’T DO IT. They are the worst. Go to any other carrier. Doesn’t have to be Verizon. kev2684 It’s all about location, location, location. Just because your area is bad, doesn’t mean everybody will have the same problem as you. J Gerard … EXCEPT that I live in a city. Oh, and Verizon’s coverage is flawless here. I happen to also know (through friends) that AT&T and Sprint are good here, too. Oh, but it’s all about location, location, location. Weak argument. T-Mobile just sucks! There’s a reason it’s so CHEAP! Austin8480 … OK JGerard. Next time, PLEASE use all capital letters to truly get YOUR point across. What I find PATHETIC is that you are a die hard Verizon turd in a TMobile blog. Oh wait, I meant Verizon TURD. Forgot to emphasize that. NOBODY in this room gives a flying —- about your opinion because you slummed it for 6 months and went to Magenta and it was as big of a mistake as…well, I will let you figure it out. J Gerard You were so busy typing a 3rd grade level post that you forgot to make a point. Here’s one for you: T-Mobile is inferior to almost all other carriers. Austin8480 If T-Mobile is so inferior, why are you even giving this blog the time of day. Are you upset that no kids want to hop in your van and eat your chocolate, so you are going to take out your frustrations on the inferior wireless network? thepanttherlady *Tip* Starbursts don’t melt :D theseanteam The hate is strong in this one. Those six months must have really scarred you or something. When you say almost all other carriers, which ones are you referring to? There are only four major carriers after all. And actually, that argument about location is a pretty strong one. T-Mobile’s network is the fastest in many locations, but can be really poor (or even non-existent) in others. The same can be said about everyone–including Verizon. Every carrier has their strong and weak areas. For someone to deny such would have to either be 1) ignorant 2) biased beyond belief or 3) troll. yankeesusa Yea, it still amazes me that people complain about coverage and then lump everyone else in america as having the same coverage, like we all live in the same area. Oh well. People never learn. I’m just happy tmobile works for me and that my data speeds are the highest iv’e ever had. At my house i’m getting close to 100megs almost every time. But hey i guess that’s not good enough for some. thepanttherlady I moved to Crestline a couple of weeks ago. No service. :'( kev2684 I had to google where that is lol :D Yeah it’s rural Ohio but I suppose Band 12 is coming? I’ve seen sightings on Band 12 in Jacksonville, FL lately as well as other parts of the country it’s currently not available. They’re probably working on it at the moment. thepanttherlady Sorry, I should have been more specific. It’s Crestline, CA. I made the same mistake when I called a county office but only Googled Crestline. Guy was really confused as they don’t have my address there. Took me a minute to figure out he was in Ohio. LOL kev2684 You’re literally live in a mountain! Views must be spectacular! thepanttherlady Some of them really are. :) Zacamandapio Verizon here we gooooooo. By the way, we went to Lake Gregory. :) thepanttherlady I’m literally 7 minutes from there. Went there 2 weekends ago to check it out. Water level is a little on the low side. Met a couple that same night that said they’d drained it for some reason and cited “water politics” because I guess the locals aren’t happy about it. Drove up from the Hesperia side this past Saturday and got to see Lake Silverwood. Will have to check it out this summer. Nice drive but hated seeing so many dead trees. :( ETA: I had to get Frontier (Verizon) internet so I could actually use my cell phone. What really sucks is: 1. I literally just got a hotspot through T-Mobile a month ago when they were offering another free line. It’s unusable. 2. I now HAVE to buy phones that have WiFi calling. Blah! thepanttherlady From the day we moved in 5/7: http://imgur.com/UQHsBZF http://imgur.com/t9Z64Q3 http://imgur.com/tm7ReiU And the lake :) http://imgur.com/1YUxwV9 http://imgur.com/tnGMcoq http://imgur.com/zhY16YK http://imgur.com/eaXr58H http://imgur.com/JO9BHJW Sharti24 Who will you be switching to? thepanttherlady I’m not switching. Yet anyway. I lose service 1/2 way up (or down) the mountain so I’ll probably have to get a very cheap pre-paid service/phone for emergencies in case I break down. Not all turnouts have a call box. I still work in Orange County and T-Mobile works fine most places I go. If it starts to be a problem then I’ll have to consider my options. Sharti24 Have tmobile send you a range extender. Not the one you plug into the internet but the one that has two boxes that boosts signal Berzerker Yeah, if you live in Bumblefuck, Montana, don’t switch. Greg Piller Shoot, I just signed up in Montana for TMO. Guess I’m “bumblefucked” lol. I have traveled to every state and been in EVERY U.S. major city multiple times living in every timezone and 11 states. My goodness you have a warped idea of “crap state”. Montana is paradise partner. You have to be from either NYC or California with that f’ed up mentality. He is right & not just in “crap” places but a lot of places like Chicago, IL where I was born and raised. Verizon & AT&T ARE better, Considerably better now in most places but TMO is gaining on them quickly & may reach parity in a few years. When THAT happens if TMO is still competitive, one would have to be a lunatic to stay with AT&T or Verizon. Berzerker …lol. I never said Montana was a “crap state.” It’s the easiest thing to think of when you think of wilderness where you won’t have service for miles. I could have picked a bunch of states, but Montana has, IIRC, the smallest habitation of humans to state ratio, behind Alaska of course. Easy target. Greg Piller To me 4 lines for $120 with TMO is enough of a savings to ditch AT&T. Verizon & AT&T and some of their customers can be arrogant & I think John Legere is one helluva CEO. I can pick up a burner sim with AT&T’s Cricket when I travel a bit and use it until TMO improves in Montana & then it’s sianara to ATT. Happy to be back with TMO. I was formerly a customer since the Voicestream days but when I moved west couldn’t keep them. Their coverage improvement in Montana & the nation as a whole with him at the helm has been nothing short of INCREDIBLE. I hope if the Sprint deal happens Legere is retained as CEO. mreveryphone Hummm… I travel the country for my job and I rarely have issues with T-Mobile… Is it perfect?? No… But no carrier is.. Verizon worked out for you, that’s great. T-Mobile works for millions, that’s also great. But this butt hurt rant is ridiculous and pure comedy! J Gerard “butt hurt rant” is kind of a dumb way to describe what I’m saying. But, I’ll consider the source, eh? Do you know ANYONE who thinks that T is better than V? Nope. So, the difference between us is that I choose to have a better service and I’m willing to pay a little more for it. You are cheap, and you’re willing to have an inferior service because it’s cheaper. That’s it. You know Verizon is better than T-Mobile Francisco Peña Anyone switching carriers should NEVER just switch without taking advantage of the initial return period. I was with VZW for yrs myself. Loved it, with my UDP that was grandfathered. Even went through one wave of price hikes to stay. Then the wife wanted a non-feature phone, and the price hike for her would have boosted out then $108 monthly payment, to $160 once we got a basic data plan, her line access fee (joke) and a new phone. So I looked into TMo. I purposely bought a phone the yr before that worked with Tmo and VZW (moto X DE) and signed up for one line of TMo, switched my Moto to Tmo and reactivated an older LTE phone I had back on VZW. Then I went around for a week doing speed tests everywhere I went. Stuck in traffic? speed test. Both side by side on the seat. Mall? yup, side by side in my hands. Work? yup. Home? yup. I hated VZW at work because my Moto could never get a signal inside the building, which caused my battery to die quickly each day. TMo? got a strong signal. Home, both were weak, but about the same. Driveway? same. So after 10 days, I went in to TMo and switched. Got 2 new phones (had a deal on G4s then) and was spending $140 for 2 lines/10GB each (was the $100/2L/10GB deal) with those phones. Has it been perfect? no. Has it been enough to switch back? no. After some finagling, got a $70 plan with 6GB each for 2 lines. Then have gotten a free line on top of that.. so now I pay $130 for 3 lines, with 6GB each (two don’t come close, mine has Stash so I’m good) and 2 new G6 phones. So for the price, its awesome. Can I deal with some poor service on the outskirts of town? sure. Oh, that Moto X? got it on the 3rd line… theseanteam I don’t think anyone has ever claimed that T-Mobile has better coverage than Verizon, but the point is it has the same quality of coverage in many places. Where I live, T-Mobile has equal coverage and faster speeds. It might not be like that for you, as everyone’s experience will vary. I’m sure if others suffered with bad service, they would switch carriers as well. But your superiority complex is just silly. mreveryphone I know plenty of people that think T-Mobile is better than VW… And I know people that think the opposite, it depends where you live. The service was inferior for you but not for me by any means… I appreciate the cheap name calling, I’ll be cheap all day if it means saving money but getting better service FOR ME… I’ve had service in buildings where others on VW had 0, I’ve smoked people on VW in data speeds tests so I’ll be cheap all day long!! Lol Vazaha There’s an unwritten agreement when you join T-Mobile that you will refrain from living in or going to crappy places. If you live in a decent place T-Mobile is fine. If T-Mobile sucks in your area, you know why :). Vazaha But seriously, I’m always envious of ATT and V when I go to crap places. tranceformer978 Why are you going to crap places? Melissa Cardenas Well what the hell are you doing on this website then? This is a T-Mobile forum obviously most people on here have T-Mobile and they Happy with it so they ain’t gonna listen to you . T-Mobile did not work in my old house so i had Verizon. Now in my new house Verizon don’t work at all and i had to get T-Mobile again because T-Mobile works here fine , So no carrier is perfect. It all depends on location!! J Gerard I get tech news alerts on my phone and things like this come up sometimes and I click on them. I believe that’s allowed! Apparently, what’s not allowed here is proper grammar and punctuation. I almost had to have your post translated in order to read it, but I figured it out eventually. Where did you go to school? Melissa Cardenas What ever im in a hurry and didn’t have time to spell check .But seriously don’t change the subject i don’t get why people like you come talk trash on a T-Mobile forum. ?? Makes no sense haha . And what ever im PRETTY sure you understood fine what i wrote in my first comment. Bull that you almost had to get it translated. Omar Boyer Melisa hes just being an idiot haha i understood perfectly well your first post. And i see they gave u some thumbs up on that first post so others also understood you no need to translate it . Ignore this lowlife with nothing to do. If he wants to stop making an Azz out of himself he should just block the notifications he gets from here. Melissa Cardenas i have better things to worry about ;) omar. And like you said he should just turn off notifications from here then. Eric Harlow Don’t give J Gerard the satisfaction in getting a reaction out of you and allow him to control the situation don’t dumb down to his level Eric Harlow Get off Melissa Cardenas butt about grammar here. This is a forum! Not a college message board or an college English Composition course. T-mobile has improved drastically within the last 3 years. T-mobile works for me out here in San Diego and in my future home in Missoula, Montana. I have mental disabilities that I got serving in The US Navy for twenty years and I dislike your comments towards Melissa Cardenas. This is a T-mobile fan website to discuss peacefully about T-mobile, so get your BIG RED DUMB AND DUMBER ASS OUT OF HERE. Andrew Addison You just made my night with that bomb diggity comment towards that boozo the snow clown filled with stuffy nose, trying to come off as English weirdo professor correcting people on their grammar fool there Bro. Is this guy here serious right now? He had no reason to talk down to someone like that and also talk down on the finest company/carrier, advising everyone to stay away from the best carrier/company which that one being T-Mobile-MetroPCS. We will forever be way Better in USA than any other carrier would have been. Eric Harlow OOH REALLY!!! HOW AWESOME!! Glad I made your night! Haze1nut English is a 3rd language for me, behind French and Portuguese. Correct my grammar for me, will you. It obviously makes you feel superior. Ascertion You think everyone that switches to T-Mobile can’t “Make calls half of the time”? You’re out of your mind! Tony Chen agreed, t mobile has gained millions of customers each quarter. if the drop calls were so bad why would t mobile gain 100% of new customers agaIN? another blockbuster quarter by t mobile. moonoverparma Funny, I’ve never had a problem. Nobody Special Several years ago i had a verizon phone (when the iphone’s came out they were the only one that were selling them with unlimited data at that time) and i had T-Mobile flip phone that i was using to make international calls. I have to admit, Verizon was more reliable than T-Mobile during my cell phone usage. I chose T-mobile over Verizon because of many reasons…. but it was never due to their coverage, because their coverage was horrible… but since then their coverage has improved. But i switched primarily due to the inexpensive international calls. That was a deal breaker for me, i was content with the terrible coverage with anticipation that they would improve their service. and with Verizon i was paying around $89 dollars for unlimited data and text and 450 minutes of voice calls. my tmobile line (from what i can remember) was around $78 dollars for unlimited talk and text and data. But fastforward to today, I have 5 Unlimited Everything (data/text/voice) lines with unlimited international calling (mobile+landlines) and international text for a low cost of $110 plus taxes and fees. Believe me i checked, Verizon or AT&T have nothing in comparison to what i have with T-Mobile. And i am not bashing you or Verizon at all, Verizon does have a more reliable coverage area but in the end i sided with T-Mobile over Verizon. If Verizon ever came up with incredible deals like T-Mobile has been doing almost every month i wouldnt turn down a great opportunity. RECAP: Verizon “Better Coverage” T-Mobile “Better Prices” It all boils down to what are you comfortable with. Im comfortable with crappy coverage. And My T-Mobile calls do drop often, but what i do is (i press redial) GOTCHA :) Gust OK so here’s the deal. In the morning when you wake up if you have T-Mobile you have to get up take a shower have breakfast shave go outside of your house in other to make a phone call. If you have AT&T or Verizon in the morning when you wake up you can reach for your cell phone and make a phone call. It is that simple. But you know what I have T-Mobile because over one year it saves me about $200 as compared to AT&T or Verizon. So I put up with the crap! Timothy Poplaski T-Mobile supports WiFi calling. You don’t have home WiFi? DM725 How do you not have wifi calling enabled? Maybe you need to buy a phone from the last 2 years… (My Motorola Nexus 6 Supported Wifi Calling….) Phone Guy All lies. So funny, yet sad. yankeesusa LOL, not everyone lives where you live and have bad coverage with tmobile. 4 years ago i would have never used tmobile, now i no longer have sprint and got rid of my verizon line because tmobile is great for me where i live and work. I just recently drove across florida,georgia,nc and tennesse and had no issues. I was able to test it side by side with an att phone and the whole time both phones had coverage except up in the smokies near newfound gap where no one has signal. Don’t lump everyone in the same pile just because it doesn’t work for you. DM725 LoL, where the hell do you live? eanfoso The only one after verizon is at&t because we know that sprint and us cellular sucks more than t mobile Andrew Singleton T-Mobile has the lowest churn rate (people trying it and leaving) of all carriers. Could you please explain why? J Gerard Ha! Oh, I promise you I don’t feel like an idiot surrounded by people who work themselves up into a breathless rant trying to defend a crappy service. gmo8492 Crappy for who exactly, churn has gone down to record lows and T-Mobile has over 73 million subs, so if it doesn’t work out you can switch. Brad C It’s not for everyone, but has worked damn well for me for 12yrs.. I *actually* tried Verizon a few months ago, and came back after two weeks after awful LTE performance JG You’re cracking me up reading your comments! I have TMo and put up with their spotty coverage because I’m paying less per month staying with them. I can admit that. There is alot I enjoy about TMo, but dropped calls and dead zones IS a reality. I have a band 12 phone in metro PHX. Not sure why others feel the need to berail someone who doesn’t agree with them just for argument’s sake. Timothy Poplaski Because you aren’t saying, “Bad coverage in PHX”, you’re saying “Bad coverage”. I can drive for at least an hour in any direction and have solid coverage. It all depends on where you live, and you’re phone. Even phones with band 12 won’t all have the same results because some phones get better reception than others. So, I won’t even argue about coverage in PHX. Never been there, likely never will, so it just doesn’t matter to me. My excellent coverage probably doesn’t matter to you. It’s all about where you use your phone. navi harriram Dude you could of tested the network out on a $10 weekly plan or $3 daily. You don’t buy cell phone service every day so do the work. The sales rep just wants a commission check so they’ll say anything to get you to switch. That’s why I don’t work for wireless companies anymore. Too much bull to deal with yankeesusa Not everyone is defending a company that may or may not work depending on where you live. But many people actually do research and pick a company that specifically works for your needs depending on your area. I had verizon and sprint before tmobile and i have never ever gotten the speeds i get now not to mention i have great coverage ‘WHERE I LIVE”, YOU SEE, that’s the important thing, i researched and made sure it worked for me. I don’t just blindly select a company just because their commercial says so. Screamin That’s strange because T-Mobile has been #1 in customer service AND satisfaction for well over 2 years now… and yes, that includes coverage. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) I am thinking about switching to Verizon due to poor coverage. In San Diego area I get one to bars. I moved from Minnesota and T-mobile coverage in MN is excellent there with all bars. In San Diego it’s very poor in some areas. When iPhone 8 is release I am switching to Verizon. I love T-mobile plans but coverage in my area is poor. Sharti24 Agreed. On base (32nd street) forget about tmobile coverage. sprint excels on 32nd. go over to corando island its even worse! just throw your phone over board. no tmobile coverage on the air base at all. im using an iphone 6s Band 12 which is deployed in SD yankeesusa I agree, if in your area tmobile is not good and is affecting productivity or just not letting you use your phone to its fullest your’e better off changing. I have great coverage where I live and work and when i travel over 99% of the time i have no issues. But i got my wife on cricket which is att so for the times where tmobile may not get signal i have the att towers just in case. I’m on an old grandfathered single line plan that allows work discount so i’m keeping as long as i can. Screamin Sometimes it’s not always the cell coverage causing the issue, but the phone itself, especially if it’s an older device that supports fewer cell bands. With T-Mobile’s latest acquirement of spectrum you can expect a huge improvement in cell signal, both in range and structure penetration, within the year. Of course you can switch if you want, but they’re only going to get better. They’ve more than doubled the coverage in the past 2 years and have just as much coverage as Verizon with a network that’s actually futureproof unlike the other guys. DM725 Agreed, I know people that don’t realize they are using a phone without band 12, that doesn’t have wifi calling or Volte support, and has an extremely weak antenna. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) My phone is iPhone 7 and not an old device: Andrew Singleton if you hold an iphone 7 next to a galaxy s8, the s8 will have more bars every time. that’s due to a more powerful signal on galaxies and the fact that bars don’t mean anything with low-frequency spectrum. Patel Nisha You couldn’t pay me to use a iPhone . And why would I switch Verizon to T-unmobile. So I can have a sub par data connection with hardly any coverage…. Andrew Why are you on TmoNews, then? Andrew Addison Lol I was just thinking the exact same thing. Lol DM725 I’m sorry you live in a place that T-Mobile doesn’t prioritize. Here in NY, we have no such issues. Andrew Singleton the offer is also good for pixels, and you don’t know anything about the network. in 1 year, verizon will wish it had t-mobile’s network. browne81 I cavy take this anymore. There is always someone in these forums going miss information. I have to speak up. As awhole some networks are better than others. I’m not going to get into my opinion on which is better nation wide. What I will say is this. The best carrier is the one that works where you frequent the most. No matter what carrier a person loves there is another person out there that thinks it terrible. So all these people saying bad things about T-Mobile should get the facts straight. Lastly I due example I don’t like sprint but I know there are people that have a great time with them. You don’t see me on a sprint site saying how bad they are. Is my spelling perfect no. Is my grammar perfect no. It’s this a college paper? No. So I really don’t care.

Editorial Director at Mobile Nations, analyst at iMore, video and podcast host, you can follow him @reneritchie on Snapchat, Instagram, and Twitter. Google has Tensor cores. Could Apple soon have AI cores of its own? Apple is already driving mobile silicon in a way few if any other companies have been able to keep up with. Now, a new report claims Apple will be using its considerable chipset chops to accelerate artificial intelligence as well. Mark Gurman, writing for Bloomberg: Apple is working on a processor devoted specifically to AI-related tasks, according to a person familiar with the matter. The chip, known internally as the Apple Neural Engine, would improve the way the company's devices handle tasks that would otherwise require human intelligence -- such as facial recognition and speech recognition. If true, this should surprise no one. Arguably, Apple's biggest advantage in computing right now is that the company custom crafts the complete stack, from atom to bit to pixel. That includes an ever-increasing amount of custom silicon. A few years ago, Apple offloaded motion tracking from its main A-series system-on-a-chip to an M-series sensor fusion hub. A few years later, it added onboard natural language parsing to the M-series to enable "Hey, Siri!" in as power-efficient a way as possible. The latest A-series, A10 Fusion, combines two high-efficiency cores with two high-performance cores to try to eek out as much battery life as possible while pushing pixels and bits as fast as possible. Anything that makes sense to offload to increase efficiency and performance, you can bet Apple is working on offloading. Including and especially AI, since it's such a hot topic these days. While Siri gave Apple an early advantage in voice recognition, competitors have since been more aggressive in deploying AI across their product lines, including Amazon's Echo and Google's Home digital assistants. This part reads oddly to me. Nothing against Mark, but it's a particularly bad narrative pervasive across U.S. media. Google Home is a single product. Echo is a growing line of similar, home-based products. Apple has pushed Siri from iPhone to and through iPad, Apple Watch, Apple TV, Mac, CarPlay, HomeKit, and accessories like AirPods. Apple has also expanded Siri across dozens of languages, including Chinese, Hebrew, and Arabic, as well as dozens of regions. It's fair to say no other vendor has yet been as aggressive as Apple in deploying virtual assistants across product lines or to customers around the world. "Two of the areas that Apple is betting its future on require AI," said Gene Munster, former Apple analyst and co-founder of venture capital firm Loup Ventures. "At the core of augmented reality and self-driving cars is artificial intelligence." This also reads oddly to me. Almost everything Apple does already requires AI. AI is going to be everywhere in computing the same way math is everywhere. There's nothing unique about special projects like augmented reality or cars. Machine learning, computer vision, and related technologies are already powering everything from battery efficiency to photo tagging, sequential inference to computational photography. Just because Google made its sound like they invented AI on the I/O 2016 stage, and it's now parroted alongside AR and VR the way mobile/social/local was a decade ago, doesn't mean companies like Apple (and Google) haven't been working on it for years. What's interesting isn't that the big tech giants are working on it; it's how they will use it to solve real problems in the information and computer space and, in Apple's case, how it will solve those problems while protecting our security and privacy at the same time.

Echo is growing line of similar, home based products. Apple has pushed Siri from iPhone to and through iPad, Apple Watch, Apple TV, Mac, CarPlay, HomeKit, and accessories like AirPods." ... except that Google's Assistant is available across mobile devices (Android, iOS), within Chrome I believe, not just through the Home product. And Alexa is present and capable on the Echo products as well as through the Alexa app, the Amazon app, the Fire stick, presumably the Fire TV, and so on. It's a valid comparison, correct? And - pardon my ignorance - is Siri present in Airpods independent of the phone? 0 1 day ago Reply bhatech Yeah smh at google home is a single product. Hello !!! google now, assistant, voice recognition is everywhere. 0 1 day ago Reply cuttheredwire The AirPods have a tap for Siri feature. Viticci mentioned he uses them for Siri in his latest podcast. "While Siri gave Apple an early advantage in voice recognition, competitors have since been more aggressive in deploying AI across their product lines, including Amazon's Echo and Google's Home digital assistants." Rene's point is that the media forgets that Siri is in so many places. Apple has been aggressively implementing Siri, but you would never know it by news coverage. He does *not* claim that Google is less aggressive or in fewer places in any way at all. 0 1 day ago Reply bhatech News coverage is about how Siri sucks, no one complains that's not in many places. They complain because it's bad compared to competition. 0 1 day ago Reply bhatech "This part reads oddly to me. Nothing against Mark, but it's a particularly bad narrative pervasive across U.S. media." Nothing against Rene, but it's just pro apple narrative from you, Gruber and few others on everything Apple does. At least Mark is honest even though he loves Apple products. Pretty much everyone is right Siri lacks and is just dumb compared to google. And, yeah Google does it many languages as well if that's your defense for whatever little Siri can do. On the positive side, I'm excited to see what Apple comes up and see how it can compete with Google given it has no other option other than pushing privacy story and how it can do everything on device. They would love to be like google but given the lack of their ability we have to see how well they can do this AI stuff on device and keeping privacy in mind. "Just because Google made its sound like they invented AI on the I/O 2016 stage, and it's now parroted alongside AR and VR the way mobile/social/local was a decade ago, doesn't mean companies like Apple (and Google) haven't been working on it for years." Really? You are so hurt on this? Even on MacBreak weekly you brought this up. This is what Apple does for pretty much everything in their keynote. Every feature they talk as if they invented it even though it's on competitor's device for years. 0 1 day ago Reply cuttheredwire They all try to make it sound like they invented it. Heck, people have forgotten there were smart phones before 2007. There were, but far fewer people had them. As for the narrative, I am seeing a lot of criticism on the media praising the Echo and viewing the Apple Watch as a flop. Yet I've read on multiple places that the watch sells more in volume and for a profit while the Echo is sold for a loss and fewer are sold. Numbers are not released, so I'm going to dig for the articles (but I believe Above Avalon was one of them). What is interesting is the way the Echo has caught the attention of the media. It's different and it is functional. There is plenty to write about since it is so open (too open for my tastes). The hardware is getting refreshed at a good pace too. As for Siri, yep, it needs work. Actually, it needs a way for me to tell it that, no, it did not understand me. That's really all I want… that and to have more fluid conversations. 0 23 hours ago Reply Jose_Rey Really? The Echo losing money? That seems strange to me. I mean, after all, it's useless if you have no internet. It cannot do anything unless it has access to it. No timers, alarms, nada. At least that's what they said in the reviews. 0 6 hours ago Reply themacbuddha How Apple approaches the digital assistant is predicated on these factors: Security/Privacy, Ubiquity, and Extensibility. Security/Privacy---Data storage and manipulation is best served on the local device when it can be and only stored and manipulated on the cloud if it can be done so at the deepest level. For a photo to be synced to and manipulated in the iCloud and for Apple to do so having excluded their ability to hold any encryption key protecting it is a very, very, very tall order. There is a reason they hired Jonathan Zdziarski. The call to crop and apply a filter needs to happen on all devices AND the cloud without compromising privacy. Keeping customer data encrypted at these levels on their servers is not in Google's best interest or even their wheelhouse. Google doesn't talk the security game. Therefor they keep themselves open to running fast and loose with your data. That means ample blood in the water for any number of bad players to go after. The trope of Google User Data Anonymization is prime for failure. Not a matter of "if" but "when". The continued treatment of end user devices as dumb terminals and the shoving of ever more data and processing power to the cloud leads to laziness on the OEM's part. We've seen this battle before. One can only assume that Samsung is not simply glomming Viv to things but actually following through on the promise of Android as a true open source solution. Don't Hold Your Breathe. Reports that Apple is creating custom silicon for managing digital dossiers should not surprise anyone. Nor should the fact that they are telling Qualcomm to take a hike now be a surprise. That they added Intel as a supplier for cellular modems is quite telling - they are going to make their own modems too. 0 21 hours ago Reply themacbuddha Ubiquity---Though it might seem obvious to most the scale of this can not be understated. The "Internet of Things" is akin to the "World Wide Web" in my mind. Tremendous promise turns into absolute morass of pain. To put some perspective to something that was mentioned in an earlier post regarding the Amazon Echo line: There is plenty of talk about how wonderful Tesla is doing. Yet the Apple Watch has generated more unit sales then Echo and more revenue then Tesla. Apple Watch is primed to leap forward this fall. This is not to belabor those companies' successes but to illustrate that the reach of Apple products and there for Siri (or whatever the overall solution is deemed to be called) exemplifies how far it can go. Apple Watch can be viewed as an accessory to iPhone. And what of any Siri Speaker (hate that name) product. What of a newer wifi system that integrates and amplifies Siri and HomeKit. What of CarPlay and other integrated auto systems. Project Titan is aptly named but probably a **** lot closer than most think to producing fruit. Extensibility---Echo has both language support and security working against it. Amazon is predominately US company. However one must appreciate that it is Walmart and their ilk that Amazon is truly competing against. Don't undersell that. Google's bread and butter on the other hand is in advertising. And they will ride that pony straight in to the ground. Their forte is on the server. Their greatest success found almost exclusively within a web browser. Again...Advertising and the World Wide Web! When combined, the most hated concept in existence. They will have a difficult time assailing that wall. I foresee a lot of WTF results that is far worse the bane of Siri now. And where might Apple fit in this? Yes, yes, yes! Fluid conversation is nice but natural language is better suited. In fact it is absolutely imperative. And never mind about just simple language support. What about muddled accents and mixed languages - Spanglish anyone? Recognize the extent third party support for Siri introduces a set of complexities far, far, far beyond the chicken scratch/Graffiti approach of Google Assistant and Alexa, and is dependant on Apple growing domains instead of leaving businesses to grab at the lowest hanging fruit. Make no mistake it is not about competing against Android/Amazon/Google/Advertising/BuynLarge. It's about creating a platform for communication and commerce that doesn't bank on the gullibility of the end user. It's all my data; what I buy, who I buy it from, what I do with it? Whose to say that a viable solution positively requires that I give up that control. Just remember....the road less travelled. (All Over The Place, I Know!) 0 21 hours ago Reply johnnygoodface That last sentence says it all! Yes indeed, security and privacy are the hole point of making an AI chip in the phone, so that requests are analyzed and decisions are taken locally, and not from a distant server, and this will hopefully makes the response time much faster. 0 12 hours ago Reply delta4s Google and Amazon are into AI for the purpose and goal of increased efficiency in advertising and selling of your data. The promoted benefits to you personnally are a side effect and not the goal. However, Apple really needs to step up. Siri has improved but has a long way to go. Apple doesn't have the cloud infrastructure setup to process AI so it needs to do it not the device. I wonder if that data can transferred to a new device. 0 11 hours ago Reply johnnygoodface "I wonder if that data can transferred to a new device."? That's indeed a very good question, one Apple should take into consideration, since all that the AI chip will have learned will need to be backup to iCloud too ---- sorry I should have replied to delta4s instead 0 10 hours ago Reply Menu Log in or Sign up Search Apple Apps & Games Accessories & Toys Photo & Video Health & Fitness Movies & Music Transport Security Rumors Analysis How To The Best Reviews Deals Newsletter Forums Podcasts Android Central WindowsCentral iMore CrackBerry Connectedly TeslaCentral VRHeads MrMobile Modern Dad About Contact Us Jobs Privacy & Terms Mobile Nations 500M Consumers Reached Yearly Copyright 2017 Mobile Nations Terms and Conditions Privacy Policy Careers: Writer | Dev Licensing External Links Disclosure Advertising Partner

Migraine World Summit’s Tools (Web): A Comprehensive List of Migraine-Fighters The Migraine World Summit is a gathering of some of the world’s leading experts on this disease. It’s a good idea to sign up for this anyway, but what’s cooler is that attendees made a list of tools to fight migraines. The list is divided into sections that target specific parts of the migraine experience, like battling an acute migraine attack or preventing migraines altogether, or factors like sleep, vision, hydration, and so on. You’ll find apps, books, exercises, advice, and a whole lot of other useful tips here. Remember, these are all advised by people who have been suffering from migraines themselves. These are tips you might not see otherwise. For example, some clinical studies have found that the right dose of ginger can abort a migraine, so you might want to eat ginger sweets and candies. 3. Palouse Mindfulness (Web): Free Course for Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction Researchers have found that a particular type of meditation can help some migraine sufferers.

[Update: Now $75 Off] Deal Alert: Pixel 32GB (international version) is $50 off on eBay Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/05/26 2:20pm PDTMay 26, 2017 2 Plus 1 on G+ 42 Share on Facebook 56 Share on Twitter Total Shares100 Deals News Pixel Update 1: 2017/05/26 2:32pm PDT It looks like the price has dropped another $25, making this a $75 savings in total. For a device that hasn't seen much in the way of price drops or It's no secret that Google has had some serious supply issues with its flagship Pixel phone. That goes for pretty much any combination of size, color, or storage. Rumors even began to surface alleging that Google had stopped production of the devices altogether. That wasn't the case, but nonetheless, you will still struggle to actually find the Pixel if you wish to buy it. A 32GB Pixel (international version) on eBay for $50 off the list price could be the answer to that problem. This is the entry level 5" Pixel, with 32GB of storage in the color Very Silver - and it's available for $599. That's $50 less than the $649 Google is still charging for it. Beware though, this is the international version of the device. So if you live in the US you'll have to check the bands to see if it works on your network. This version won't play nice with Verizon or Sprint, so if you're on either of those carriers you can rule this out. If you live outside the US then this is definitely for you. Shipping appears to be free in the US, but here in the UK, it's $18.99. That still works out a bargain for me, especially if you account for the exchange rate. You'll have to do the sums from where you are to see if the deal is as good for you. It's worth mentioning that getting your warranty honored might be tough with this type of purchase, so bear that in mind. It's hard to say how many of these they have, other than a "limited quantity," so you'll have to be quick if you want to get your hands on arguably the best Android phone of 2016. Update 1: 2017/05/26 2:32pm PDT It looks like the price has dropped another $25, making this a $75 savings in total. For a device that hasn't seen much in the way of price drops or sales since launch, $75 off isn't bad. Anyone interested in a Pixel that uses a network compatible with this international model should give it a serious think.

Andy What do you mean? jonzey231 If you don't buy the phone from Google, they won't help you. They send you to the manufacturer. I was forced to go to Huawei for my 6P and it was a little over 3 weeks before I got it back....and the problem is still there. Spend the extra $50 and buy it through Google so you're guaranteed to get support through their CS channels. You'll be glad you did in 6 months when something inevitably goes wrong. IMHO get the OnePlus 3T. Costs less but has better overall specs aside from the camera which is still pretty good in its own right. My brother has one and my roommate just got his last week and they both have no intention of going back to a major brand ever again. YaKillaCJ Same happened when I got the OnePlus One. It changed the way I (and many others) view a "budget" device from an unknown brand. needa I felt the same way after using an OPO for nearly three years. Got me an XL in mint condition for $450. Google edition even. Still had 3520 mAh in the batt too. Would have bought the black 3T had they been in stock. Took me three days to hunt down this deal. Andy Got my wife the pixel. Runs great. Just had the microphone problem. Google swapped without question. Wife seems to think it takes horrible selfies. Rod Weird, as it's cameras are regarded among the best currently. Random! @andy maybe you should let her know that the camera isn't the problem... It's actually her face. If you do warn her about this, I promise to visit you at the hospital. Andy Thanks for the tip. VAVAMk_2 Huzzah! Master Yates Agreed with you regarding the 3T. Lets see if the excellent updates and support evaporate when the One Plus 5 is released? That's the real test. IcerC Except in this case Google is the Manufacturer, that might change things. VAVAMk_2 Google didn't make the camera. Uses a Sony made sensor but the camera software is Google's and regarded among the best in post processing, particularly HDR. Roy Ahh so nice call me when the 1+2 will get Nougat and your friend will get or never get Android O. ddevito #Fail Andy S8 release response? AdMoc Does not ship to Poland as fck always -_- Random! Look for some service like Shipito. I believe they have an EU warehouse. Shakil Shaikh $60 shipping? kristin ANY Pixel made by google is compatible with any provider. It doesnt matter if its international or not. This writer is an odiot. Scott Scrivens https://www.techwalls.com/google-pixel-pixel-xl-model-number-differences/ Kevin Davis "Odiot", lmao. 😂 Oh, and you're wrong, too. kristin I called google about this. It would be up your phone company provider whether it worked or not. So it may not work with att or tmobile either. kristin This may or may not work on any provider. Its up to the provider. You want a pixel? Go to swappa.com and get one used in mint condition for much cheaper. Ive gotten a few phones from them since ive been on project fi and had no issues. Ill never buy a new phone again. Random! $50 off? How cute... If they get to $300 off ($350 final price) within a month, I might even convince myself it's worth to stare at those bezels everyday. Other than that (impossible) scenario, I'd rather get the 3T, Axon 7, or even the LG G5. Gjorgi Lazarovski The Pixel is probably not dropping in price anytime soon. iKon The most overrated smartphone of 2016. Only the camera is decent. Ugly ass design, overpriced and dull with no features compared to competition Roy You mean the best smartphone of 2016, best camera rare band front, best software, best updates. Great battery, great display. xyz No, he means "The most overrated smartphone of 2016. Only the camera is decent. Ugly ass design, overpriced and dull with no features compared to competition." Roy No, I'm sure he/she means "the best smartphone of 2016, best camera rare band front, best software, best updates. Great battery, great display". iKon No I meant what I said. The pixel is a flop and even Google knows it. No matter how much money they put into advertising there are alot of better choices out there.. only hard core Google fanboys try and big it up Roy Yes yada yada and still every reviewer said is the best smartphone of 2016. So.. even David here. In the on of the day it's a lots about the UI and I just don't like Samsung software. Ordeith LOL. You're such a Google sycophant, Roy. Roy You feeling really smart? I'm Imagine your ass all over your face. nirmitlamed Google is so off track in figuring out what customers wants and competing against the other monstrous companies. I would very much like to hear how many Pixels Google sold in the last year since they told us they sold more than they expected. Lawrence I can put my coffee cup on the Bezel David Nowicki I'm a big Nexus fan, but why would you pay $749 for the Pixel XL vs the OnePlus 3T at about half the price ? And soon the OnePlus 5 at $450 or so with S8+ specs will be a steal compared to the Pixel 4Ui812 Supply and demand. Limit the supply and you increase demand. It's like P.T.

New Level 4 Local Guides for Google Maps will no longer receive free 100GB of Drive storage Richard Gao Follow View All Posts 2017/03/03 7:30pm PDTMar 3, 2017 65 Plus 1 on G+ 120 Share on Facebook 71 Share on Twitter Total Shares256 Google News Local Guides is a program by Google Maps in which you "help others explore the world and get great benefits in return" (Google's words, not mine). Well, it looks like those great benefits are about to become merely average benefits, as Google is completely ditching free Drive storage for new Level 4 Local Guides, who currently get 100GB for one year. This removal of free Drive storage as a reward follows a similar event from back in July of 2016, when the promo for new Level 4 Guides was slashed from 1TB for two years to 100GB for one year. When that happened, we assumed that Google Maps was having too many people reach Level 4 too quickly; the same thing is probably applicable here. Here's Google's explanation: As our global community of Local Guides continues to grow, we occasionally make changes to our program. We look forward to offering our most active and consistently-contributing Local Guides more features and perks throughout the year. Not all hope is lost, though; if you're a Local Guide, you'll still receive your free 100GB if you reach Level 4 prior to March 17th at 11pm EST. As someone who's recently gotten into this whole thing, I'm probably going to be adding to my current 63 points (Level 3) quite rapidly in the span of the next two weeks.

Just reached Level 4 last week! :) mchalakov I still have my 1TB for one more year Steven Kelby Me too, but then what do we do? Forced to buy a pixel phone I guess. Or pay $125 per year. Ramon Or delete shit..Storage with expired dates shouldn't be a thing. Steven Kelby Yeah it's a trap. What a scam. JG $125 for a year doesn't sound all that bad... Though your a little high... If you buy a whole year, it's only $99.99 ($9.99/month if you pay per month). Though I really don't need a whole terabyte (right now I'm only using 1.09GBs of my 1TB+19GB)... I may go for the $19.99/year for 100GBs though... Steven Kelby I'm in Australia so it costs more here, that's AUD. I guess it's not too bad but a hard drive is much cheaper. Just need to have it networked off site at a friends house in case the house burns down! Vlad What if there's an earthquake and both your houses fall down? Steven Kelby Hopefully I'll get squashed too so it won't matter. Checkmate. Vlad That's... actually the answer I wanted. mchalakov You are not forced to do anything...your files will not be deleted even when the promo runs out. I'm pretty sure you didn't fill the full 1TB.Also you knew before that the this is a timed promotion. I really don't get the drama around here... Steven Kelby I did fill the full 1tb already, music, pics and video from my phones and cameras. It's good that it won't get deleted, I didn't know that. Đức Thành AFAIK your data won't get deleted when the extra storage expires, but in order to upload new files you'll have to either delete files to free up space or buy new space, which can be quite inconvenient at times. Kevin Brown I do too. Thanks for reminding me. I have unlimited storage through Crash Plan for my home network. I'll download my photos from Drive and upload them to Crash Plan from one of my on-site data servers. I'll write a script to pull down the photos, and let Crash Plan do its thing view every 15 minute back up. Google doesn't stick with ANYTHING, it's like an elementary school Jr Achievement "business." Never count on anything coming from Google to last. mchalakov Why ..a lot of Google services are running and lasting and still last :D Nothing is unlimited. I really doubt that you do need more than 1TB for your photos. For me on the other side - I'm working as a photographer...and I do shoot in RAW. I'm on my 2nd full TB at home :D Besides when the 1TB promo is over next year all the files will still be accessible ,you just can't upload more. Kevin Brown Tell me one service that Google's put out in the past ten years that's still running. Other than search and AdWords.. I will download because Google cannot be trusted to keep those photos. They are not customer focused one whit. I also shoot in RAW with my camera, and I too upload to my home network, which is backed up to Crash Plan. I also have a second backup to a former employer. The Google bit is just phone photos that are spur of the moment. 1639GB used as of today. That includes things like work documents, Titanium Pro backups on top of my photos. Kevin Brown Top 10 of many services Google has killed, and told customers to go eat shit and die. http://lifehacker.com/top-10-services-google-killed-off-1792897076 Andy The expiration made it pretty meaningless to me anyway.

Howard Stern ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Snuck right in since I got level 4 just last month Kevin Davis Damn, almost to level 4, I guess I'd better pick up the pace for the next couple of weeks, as the author mentioned. KingS I'm so glad I reached level last year shortly before they got rid of the 1TB offer. David Hyman Me too! Not that I am anywhere near my 1TB limit, it's nice to have Đức Thành How long does the 1 TB last? Fiorta Just claimed mine two days ago... Just in time it appears Ash The person who works so much to reach level 4, Google should give them atleast 50 GB free for life Samarth I second that! Vratislav Jindra I third that. SimonPieman Works so much by posting shit reviews consisting of "ok" for places they have never been to.. Google would have been better going for quality over quantity. Ash You are right. But not all are like this. I am at level 2 in 4 years and all my reviews are original and detailed plus i upload photos as well. It might take my another 1-2 years to reach level 4 Drakenoid I wrote detailed reviews in a rush last year when 1tb promotion was announced as being removed and got to level 4 and got the promotion but I was downgraded to level 3 for some reason, despite none of my reviews being basic. So it doesn't matter. You can try to do what I did, maybe you'll get this promotion. Ozl I reached level 4 by mostly uploading pictures mchalakov This is a risk of any service using user submitted content. They do review the reviews. kerma frog sound like you did it as well faggot Sushil Singh I have reached level 4 in 2 years and review and add photos only places i personally visit. Đức Thành If someone manages to reach level 4 in less than 4 months, they probably deserve better than 50 GB, but I'd still take what I can get. Too bad it won't even be an option. AOSPrevails I made lv4 a year ago, back when the reward was 1TB, it got so popular that Google had to nerf it to 100GB and now this. exadeci It was planned all along, they just want free workers so they attract you with advantages and make you "special" with event in their HQ but at the end of the day you work harder and for cheaper (even taking in account the advantages and events) than minimum wage workers and now that they got an army of Local Guides they don't need to offer you anything more than a "badge" Leonardo Baez I need 120pts to reach level 5, what would I get? Tizio Caio An applause Đức Thành A notification from Google that says "Congratulations on reaching Level 5 as a Local Guide!" JP How can you reach level 4 quickly? I'm at 3. Morten Ulv The quickest is probably to do quick reviews of places you've been or answer questions about places you've been. You only get one point per business if I remember correctly, so answering one question per place is enough if you really want to power through. R Gerald Saul You get one point per business, but you get a point for a review, a point for a picture, a point for updating detailed information, etc. Nicholas Conrad Airports and malls my friend. Vlad I modified the schedule of all McDonald's in my country with McDrives. They all have non-stop schedule, so I just took the list from their website and changed all of it on Google Maps. For some reason, I got dropped back to level 2 or 3 after a day, but I already redeemed my 1 TB. Drakenoid They do that, even I got dropped to level 3 (it may have been 2 but it's been an year and am on level 3 now at least) abc I've heard that being a loser with a lot of free time is very helpful. Jason Farrell Same here, but I've only reviewed stuff for fun over the years, instead of spamming crappy "OK" reviews for every little dinky place I've been to like some people do. I've got 111 of the 200 points needed to level up to lvl4, but since I'm already paying $20/yr for the 100GB there's not much point. Drakenoid Write as many detailed reviews as you can for the places you've been to, and redeem it as soon as you get to level 4. JG You can get up to 5 points per location: 1. If it's not yet on Maps, add it 2. If any information (hours, website, phone etc) is incorrect out missing, submit corrections 3. Answer some super yes/no questions 4. Write a review 5. Submit a photo You get 1 point for each, regardless if you submit multiple photos or answer multiple questions. But more never hurts. Spend a weekend walking around your local downtown, mall, and anywhere else there are a lot of businesses. If nothing else, snap a picture of each. If you know the place, answer questions about it. If you really know it, leave a review. That'll get you at least one, if not 3 points per location. Đức Thành Though these are not things I don't already have a good idea about, they're very nice and detailed tips regardless. Saved for future references, thanks. Nate Somsen I just might plug my blog, I wrote like two weeks ago, with helpful ideas on how to get those points... http://www.natesomsen.com/blog/your-guide-to-google-local-guides/ exadeci >Level 4 Guides was slashed from 1TB for two years to 100GB for one year. 100 GB for a year costs you $24, trying to get level 4 will consume you more time than it's value. 1TB for 2 years was $240 Marcell Lévai I have 148 points, so I need around 50 to get to level 4. Well, I guess I'll start taking photos everywhere. I am a paying Google Drive customer, but also a student, so not needing to pay for 100 gigs of Drive storage for a year would be nice. :P Ramon Yawn. Like..Why give storage only to take it away. So I fill half of that extra 100 GB. After it expires then what? "You're out of space, please delete. Spare me the stress. PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ The old promos for Moto X for free 1 yr. storage said anything on the drive would stay there, but you couldn't add anything when the year expired. Zorak✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵉᵛᶦˡ And that "anything" includes email attachments, found out the hard way. Vlad No, that includes not being able to receive emails. It's on their FAQ... Zorak✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵉᵛᶦˡ Not sure if you're trying to confirm or contradict, but since you initiated your statement with a negative I'll assume it's the latter so allow me to offer this anecdotal evidence, when my free storage period ran out I kept receiving notifications telling me to delete contents to be able to receive emails. But if in fact you're trying to confirm you should read PixelXLellence's comment and my reply again. Hint: I referenced to the "anything" on the later part of the sentence. Vlad Oops, sorry. PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ +1 for the Zorak avatar https://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/space-ghost.jpg?w=805 Zorak✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵉᵛᶦˡ Heh, thanks. I tried to find someone more Evil™ than Dick Dastardly and who better than Zorak. And it worked. I'm way more evil now and the politically correct bunch finds me unequivocally detestable. https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/b2/Space_Ghost_Coast_to_Coast.png P.S. It's all in the eyes. Morten Ulv If you already pay for it, you save like 20 bucks that year. Oh joy. :P Jesús Cuenca Once i got $20 from google to use on cabify, that was nice :v Impulse_Vigil Dang, I'm at 52 pts, time to get contributing. Đức Thành You can make it. I believe in you. Miku is Best Vocaloid I need to hurry the fuck up, I'm level 3. Đức Thành Same, been contributing since January. How long have you been a Local Guide? Miku is Best Vocaloid Since September, I wasn't very active the last few months. Đức Thành How many points have you got? I had 87 points yesterday, and today I'm at 112. Wanna bet on who will level up first? :D Morten Ulv Oh right. I got level 4 back in november, but wanted to wait to redeeming it. Missed the part about expiration after 30 days. Oh well, not like I really need it anyway, seeing as photos are free and it expires after a year. JPLoureiro I contribute for fun and don't expect much in return except for some geeky stats and badges, though some credit for Google play would be nice as well. Đức Thành Same but this news still makes me upset for some reason. I wasn't even aware of the rewards before this (I was vaguely aware that there were awards for Local Guides but that's it, and I'm not even doing this for the rewards). I wonder what this phenomenon is called. Rok Tur! Another job illuminated by technology the critic LOL Same, I like to give fair reviews etc, and I always read other reviews when I go to places. Google credits or some T-shirts would be nice for every level up Chips N I wasn't aware of the program. I knew I got "points" or gained levels for it, but I thought it was just "pointless" fun, no pun intended. It would always ask me nonstop about places I've driven past or places I go in to for a quick five minutes and then leave (just browsing, etc.) If they gave even a penny for each review (in credit), I'd be a tad more tempted to put some thought into leaving a review, for places I've actually been to, of course. Trent I hit level 5 a while back and just recently passed 5,000 points. I hope and think that the reason for these scale backs is to give people like me more incentive to go for the new tiers when they're announced. Đức Thành Well fuck me, 2017 has been a quite effortful yet unrewarding year so far. Not counting many other things mostly unrelated, I've begun actively contributing to Google Maps for the last three months, and while I've added several places, made edits, posted hundreds of photos (reached over 15.000 views just a few days ago) and written quality reviews and yet this is all I got from Google: https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/b1f85b49be32e63f852423898894791d3b68700553c85aa1791d8352a68cbe1b.png It's just not a very fair system. And now I have to add "getting 87 more Local Guide points in the next 2 weeks" to the list of things to do, if I want to get a reward. Life just doesn't let you catch a break, as it would seem. Maxr1998 Yeah, I also think that's very unfair.. I'm living in the countryside, so it took ages for to reach lvl 3, now I won't even get storage anymore once I finally reach lvl 4. Oh, btw, 87 to 200 is an additional 113 points.. Đức Thành I feel for you man. My problem is mostly a technical one, as I find the whole process of sharing photos to Google Maps from Google Photos to be quite cumbersome (my Nexus 5 has 2-3 GB to store new photos and I back up and delete local photos every 1-2 days or so, so when I get into the mood of actually contributing to Google Maps every few days, I would have to dive into Photos, find photos of places I took few days prior and download them, then upload to Maps; and while this doesn't sound like that much of a problem it becomes a problem for me as I take a *shit load* of photos everyday). 113 points? Well shit, I guess that means more work for me, then. Shon G. I just uploaded about 20 pictures directly from Photos. Đức Thành The problem is I also want to do a review when I add photos, or at least get credited for it, but the way Maps currently implements it, if you add photos directly from Photos via Maps's suggestions it does neither and your contributions stay anonymous. Which is kinda pointless to me. Drakenoid Maps should show your photos from Google photos backup in the app itself, so try that out. Đức Thành I am well aware, what I am complaining about is Maps's current implementation of it. Đức Thành Dunno if you're interested, but I'm here to report on the progress and this is what I managed in the span of one day (going out has been costly and time-consuming and I'm wondering if this is really worth it): https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/6b084860808db2c74a19d67429f11e554a5f1b88fc19f5c0b3d9f9e1c6b308b8.png So um, let's see, 88 points to go? This is getting increasingly harder than I thought. But at the same time if you view this as a game it could be quite a fun challenge. By the way, how many points have you got? I think there are a few things you can do to earn points even if you live in the countryside, like visiting monuments and adding new landmarks and whatnot. Just a suggestion. Maxr1998 Great work! I was at 104 15 minutes ago, but you reminded me to open GMaps and now I'm at 111. I might be able to get to 200 until March 17 if I push myself hard enough, but it still sucks to have to hurry so much. Also, since the promotion is only valid one year, it doesn't help me much since I have 100 GB since March 2018 anyway, because of my HTC phone from last year. Would have loved to be able to continue with a fresh year of 100 GB next year, by then finishing my Local guide lvl, but now I will probably have to pay then (I actually need the 100GB for my photos). Maxr1998 So a little update from my side, I hope that you managed to reach lvl 4, I didn't. I got to around 145, 55 more points just wasn't possible (and I still didn't reach it, currently 152). In the end I didn't even bother anymore, I'll probably just buy a subscription next year when my HTC Promotion ends, as I would have had to do anyway, so no real loss for me tbh.. Đức Thành Sorry for the late reply (thanks to crappy ISPs in my country I have had to use a VPN service every time I want to read any disqus comments and I am just too busy to bother nowadays), but here's some update from me as well. I did actually manage to reach Lv 4 more than a day before the deadline, and I still get emails from Google Maps team notifying me about how many views my photos get (more than 100.000 views the last time I checked), but I never did receive any news about the storage reward. I almost went to post a complaint on Local Guides community, but in the end I decided it wasn't worth it. So here's the funny thing: I was very active in contributing to Google Maps before, and I never really cared about getting the reward and certainly wasn't even aware that there was a reward system before I read this news about Google reducing the reward. But after this whole thing I completely stopped posting anything thanks to a lack of motivation. I think the reward system kinda ruined this hobby for me and turned it into some labor work; and thanks to how badly Google manages the reward system's actual execution, it turned into unrewarded work in the end. Now I don't even bother thinking about this as it leaves a bad taste, and it's ironic that I used to make really good photo posts and reviews before this happened, and it used to be fun. So I guess your not making it is actually a fortune thing, haha. KingS Yeah i feel ya. I got a photo with over 3 million views and it only counts as 1 point, like a photo with only 20 views. Anyways, Id recommend taking a lot of photos when youre out and about, because Google Maps will suggest you add them and they each doing as a point. Also, andere questions about businesses you've been to and keep your reviews short, but detailed. Đức Thành I already do that, maybe much more than I can possibly be expected of, simply because I like to do things properly and thoroughly, but thanks! I will keep it up. Michael D. Local guides are improving Google Maps for free, something that would otherwise would cost lots of money, and this is how Google is thanking us? I'm already a level 4 guide but seeing that there are no real benefits for all the work I've done and the data I've been submitting, I will stop doing so. I've been doing this just for fun, but in reality I've been helping them acquire costly data. Well, that's about what does it. henleyb I do it just to help others and overall hopefully ensure companies improve their services etc. The extra benefits are nice but feel a little shallow with it being for just the year. Especially since if you use it blindly you're then going to have to move all your data before it expires or start paying. Why not give 20GB for life or something, that would be a nice gesture for Google to acknowledge that while we are helping others we're also helping their company too. Either way, I find Google maps incredibly helpful for a vast range of reasons so I'm happy to contribute to 'pay back' and hopefully make it better for everyone without any rewards. Đức Thành Same, I'm a little disappointed in Google tbh but the reason I will keep contributing regardless is going to be because of the community. I was a nerd (still am) who didn't know the street names inside a 1 km diameter around my own area just a year ago, but thanks to people's contributions to Maps I can go out with much more confidence now and I am getting to know way more streets and new interesting places (even helped me with several jobs in the outskirt of my hometown), so being able to contribute back to the community can be seen as a reward in itself. Still disappointed in Google, though. Oh well. LOL Google has been a bunch of cheap little motherfuсkers lately Hamilton Jimenez Vasquez Totally agreed with you, Im level 4, but lately Im losing my inspiration for contributing. Cakefish I'm currently Level 3. It's like an addictive minigame. A clever way of crowdsourcing information. Corey Munns I reached level 4 back in December but still haven't gotten my 100gb. Emily My 100 GB only lasted 4 months anyway. When it prematurely ended, I went round and round with help desk people. In the end Drive people said they couldn't help me because it was a Local Guides thing, and Local Guides people said they couldn't help because it was a Drive thing. x.Ramin What about your data? Does it get deleted too? Đức Thành Carl Sagan Dammit Google, I probably should add this "Drive vs. Local Guides rewards contradiction thing" to the "list of things to resolve when I become the head of Google one day," if that issue still hasn't been resolved by then. (Typing this with a straight face because I'm completely and totally serious.) Light I was working on it. Reviewing everywhere I went and all. Well then, I'll just stop and continue on Tripadvisor. No reward, no help building the platform. At least Tripadvisor is mainstream, so I contribute to something people actually use for reviews at least. Đức Thành TripAdvisor is even worse when it comes to the process of making contributions though. Really inconvenient and effortful, and not as many people get to reap the benefits from your reviews either. Chronos90 Do I have to do something to get this reward? I was close to Level 4 and added another review which took me to Level. Didn't got any notice yet LOL I'm almost level 6 bitchеs Margaritas Ante Porcos People are as greedy as orthodox priests. All good deeds need to be paid, otherwise no reviews. eep2378 Good thing I'm level 4 already...😀 Ailín Ó’S I still have the 1TB of free storage but I'm not sure how I feel about this. On one hand it will help limit people reviewing places they've never been to with a "cool" or "good" or whatever just to get the points but on the other it no longer incentivises people to genuinely contribute to the app and make it better. belac77 I wonder if they'll replace it with another perk? mchalakov Whoa...chill everybody. Even though we as Local Guides are helping Google ,we are also helping each other. Especially in some areas which you don't have any information. The moment you started doing this you knew there is going to be nothing in return or if there is anything it's a limited promotion. So if you want 100GB buy it it's $2 /month. kerma frog how bout no? Maleko Wow... I did a lot to get to Level 4 to redeem that free storage, and I did it with decent photos and decent reviews etc... Firstly it's pointless to have the storage expire, especially when Google don't offer 500GB in their storage tariff. Now to remove the incentive totally... dick move. GarethSargeant 100 reviews since yesterday. Sticking with places I've been to though. My name is…. And thats why they dont offer GB any more. Nate Somsen You'd think that Google would have some kind of algorithm to detect an unnatural increase in contributions in such a short amount of time... Đức Thành Why though? Regardless of the frequency of new photos and reviews, it's the accuracy and quality that matters, right? Some people like to take lots of photos of places but don't contribute right away every time, and when they do it in their spare time just have to batch-process a bunch of new places, I think it should be fair game. Ohid Khan https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/6d2b4544c67bb885685a2487b72f82a4d31c0735e832702b911d6210b1a3a29c.jpg Wendy’s Angels Does she come from a pedophile family? She's another like chelsea handler, with her old slutty self, creaming over Obama. Doby Gillis Your dementia is kicking in. WTF does that have to do with the article? Dirge No worries, I got the 1TB free for 2 years back in July. TheScienceEnthusiast1130 LMFAO Google = $$$ SB Level 5 - 167 photos - over a million views. Geoff Johnson Glad I got in when it was 1TB, which is good through March 2018. Андрей Бельский And what if i have been of 4th level (long ago) and will reach 5th level. will I get this 100gb storage as promotion? Biggles Remember when the Google motto was "don't be evil"? We've done a pile of work for Google for free. It'd cost them a lot of money to either buy the data if they could buy it somewhere, or cost them a lot of money to hire people to do data entry. Either way, it saved them forking out. And it improved their search and maps tremendously, so that it strengthened their grip of the market and they make yet more money. The cost to them was drive space, and probably so little in financial terms that they'd struggle to actual calculate it. People are upset less because of the cost of Drive storage, less because the perks changed, but more because Google made out they cared about their users and having a community of local guides. And it turns out that they don't care. Anthony I'm happy I hit level 4 back when it was 1tb. I didnt know it went down. Anthony https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/18c73e40001f06e7055d333e9d4ad4b7ac0a0c1db1e2b065f1971cce06ae3d02.png Omega192 ITT a bunch of entitled whiners. Oh, you've "done a pile of work for Google for free"? They've been providing many if not most of their services to you for free, Maps included. If you really cba to contribute to Maps unless you're given something in return, then go right ahead and stop contributing. No one is forcing you to continue. Wouldn't be surprised if this was brought on by people leaving low effort reviews just to get to the point they were rewarded. God forbid Google take steps to lessen that rather than just shell out unlimited rewards at a loss. chimichanga I've reached level 4 a few days ago but still haven't seen an increase in Google Drive space. How long does this usually take? Was thinking it would be more or less imminent. chimichanga all good, have actually received it now Vladislav Shumkin so the bonus drive space just arrives later automatically? or you need to apply somewhere to redeem? chimichanga yes, an email to activate the free storage arrived around 3 days after I reached level 4 Anthony C Russano III I was lucky enough to secure the FREE 1TB before they pulled it. I am so stoked on that one. hehehe Follow Android Police 1.49M 471k 144k 116k Latest Deals 14 [Deal Alert] Several movies and TV episodes on Google Play are on sale for Memorial Day 2017/05/27 6:37pm PDTMay 27, 2017 4 [Deal Alert] Get a 3-pack Arlo Pro security system for $450 ($130 off), if you have Amazon Prime 2017/05/27 12:04pm PDTMay 27, 2017 15 [Deal Alert] Two 6' USB-C to USB-C cables $5 at Amazon w/coupon ($7 off) 2017/05/27 10:52am PDTMay 27, 2017 2 [Deal alert] Get the previous-gen 7" Amazon Fire tablet for $39.99 ($10 off) 2017/05/27 9:52am PDTMay 27, 2017 50 [Update: Now $75 Off] Deal Alert: Pixel 32GB (international version) is $50 off on eBay 2017/05/26 2:20pm PDTMay 26, 2017 Latest Poll Do you use a screen protector on your phone?

Pre-order: Surface Laptop | NEW Surface Pro All in on AI Is Microsoft following Google's lead on AI? By Jason Ward Friday, May 26, 2017 at 12:00 pm EDT 52 Comments Jason L Ward is a columnist at Windows Central. He provides unique big picture analysis of the complex world of Microsoft. Jason takes the small clues and gives you an insightful big picture perspective through storytelling that you won't find anywhere else. Seriously, this dude thinks outside the box. Follow him on Twitter at @JLTechWord. He's doing the "write" thing! "Mobile first, cloud first" has been Microsoft's CEO Satya Nadella's guiding mantra for the company since 2014. Things have recently changed, however. Nadella often says mobility is not about a single device but rather the mobility of a user's experiences across many devices supported by an intelligent cloud. Google's CEO Sundar Pichai said in an interview just before Google I/O 2016 that he's "on a journey from mobile to AI." The interview further expounded: "Pichai is also focused on shifting Google's journey from 'mobile-first to AI-first.'" Coincidentally, during his keynote at Build 2017, Nadella shared that Microsoft too is moving from a mobile-first, cloud-first vision to one that places AI at the forefront. So is Microsoft following Google? The future of the PC is a family of devices connected by an intelligent cloud Shift from mobile first, cloud first? Nadella stated the following during his Build 2017 keynote: We're moving from what is today's mobile-first, cloud-first world to a new world that is going to be made of an intelligent cloud and an intelligent edge. [The] user experience is getting distributed across devices. It's no longer just mobile first ... it's not about one device, an app model for one device. The user experience itself is going to span all of your devices ...Your personal digital assistant by definition is going to be available on all your devices. [As] you move between devices it's going to be there helping you gets tasks done. Nadella during his Build 2017 keynote. Oddly, it seems that Nadella is defining mobile first as being centered around one device and a single app model, rather than how he historically defined it. Furthermore, his shift toward an intelligent cloud and intelligent edge vision now adopts the "mobility-of-experiences" definition he historically applied to his mobile-first, cloud-first vision. He further explained this platform shift has an AI focus that benefits from investments in the "edge of the cloud." Serverless computing allows for pieces of logic to exist outside of the bounds of a virtual machine (VM) making that logic mobile. Existing on the "edge of the cloud" where hundreds of gigabytes of data can be processed for tasks such as those associated with an autonomous or connected car, computational power moves to the cloud's edge. Nadella explained that AI in such an environment is more distributed. Clearly, Microsoft's "mobility-of-experiences" vision remains unchanged, though it resides beneath an AI-first umbrella. Furthermore, investments in AI have been a decades-long strategy for Microsoft. Given these facts, one must wonder if Nadella's public setting of a new pole star from mobile first, cloud first to an AI-focused guidance is a reactive measure to Google's clear dedication to and observable success in the same. Google's all about AI Like Microsoft, Google invested in first-party hardware but for different reasons. Microsoft's hardware strategy positions a growing family of Windows 10 devices as an actual and aspirational medium for the Universal Windows Platform (UWP). Google's hardware strategy provides a platform for its AI vision. Both Microsoft and Google are invested in hardware, though for different reasons Google's earlier AI, Google's Now, was founded on the popular industry-leading Google search engine. Its ability to serve and anticipate a range of Android and iPhone users' needs made it a leading personal assistant. Unlike its rivals, Apple's Siri and Microsoft's Cortana, however, it lacked attributes that made it personal. With Google Assistant, which is described as a user's personal Google, the Mountain View company has attempted to reframe the powerful search engine as every individual's personal Google. Ok, Google Assistant Google Assistant is more personal than its predecessor and gets to know users over time. During Google I/O 2016, the Google Home smart speaker, the Pixel smartphones, and Google's new messenger Allo were all introduced as platforms for the Assistant. Truth be told, Google Assistant is as much a defensive move as it is an offensive move for Google. In an app- and AI-dominated world, "search" is no longer just a destination we go to; it's integrated into our apps and digital assistants. Google confronts this challenge to its core (ad revenue) business by making search personal and marketing Assistant as an evolution of the familiar Google search engine. Google wants users to know its AI has the advantage of being based on the world's leading search engine. Rishi Chandra, vice president of product management for Google's living room devices, said: "There is no better engine of answering any question that you have. We fundamentally believe that." Microsoft may fear that this is true given the number two position of Bing and consumers' general lack of awareness of Cortana. Google's AI push This year, Google expanded its AI vision by adding Google Assistant to smartwatches, Android TV, cars and the iPhone (joining Siri and Cortana). The company also expanded the Assistant's ability through Google Home and Chromecast. Visual responses from Google Home can now appear on the TV. Google I/O 2017. Google Lens, the company's AI-driven camera app, allows users to point their phones' cameras at people, places and things to glean information about them based on Google's extensive knowledge graph. Like Microsoft and the 2016 private preview release and recent general release of the Cortana SDK, Google has released the Assistant SDK. Third parties can now integrate Assistant into their hardware as Cortana was incorporated into the Harman Kardon speaker. Microsoft, Cortana and AI In 2014, while the tech world was focused on health platforms, wearables and the rumored bigger iPhones, Microsoft was fine-tuning its AI vision. Cortana was about to make its debut on Windows Phone. Beyond a mere voice assistant, it was obvious then Cortana had potential as an intelligent UI for transient computing across Windows devices. AI, bots and canvases: An evolving view of Microsoft's AI vison In early 2014, few foresaw Microsoft's embrace of the iPhone and Android, however, though by July 2015 it was evident. Nor did I see, then, Cortana as a singular artificial intelligent UI for users' experiences across Windows, iOS and Android bound together by the Microsoft graph, as demonstrated at Build 2017. Former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer gave a forward-looking description of the unifying effects of Microsoft's graph in 2013. His statements are specific to Windows devices but foreshadow Microsoft's Windows-as-a-hub, binding users' cross-platform experiences: The experience we will deliver across all our devices centers on the idea of better connecting people with the things they care about most ... files, documents, photos, videos, notes, websites, snippets, digital history, schedules, tasks, and mail and other messages, combined with real-time information from our devices and services. It is more than what we think of as the shell today, and no current label really fits where we are headed. The shell will support the experiences layer and broker information among our services to bring them together on our devices in ways that will enable richer and deeper app experiences. Microsoft's graph as a unifier of all platforms and experiences is a vital part of the company's AI and platform vision. As a single underlying "super platform," Microsoft's graph enables Cortana to become the UI for experiences for all platforms. This approach to AI in conjunction with Cortana's democratization via the SDK makes Microsoft's strategy a worthy contender to Google's well-positioned Assistant. Are Microsoft's AI efforts following Google's? Microsoft began investments in machine learning, natural language processing, and deep neural networks long before Google became an AI-first company. Ballmer and Gates pave way for Nadella's AI vision In the following video, Microsoft Research's Eric Horvitz talks about the company's investments in AI: During Build 2016, Microsoft introduced Conversation as a Canvas and the Bots Framework. Nadella also described Cortana as a meta-app that would interface with bots. Apps such as Skype, WhatsApp, Line, Slack and others were described as canvases for conversations that would connect with bots and AI, and human language was then identified as the UI. This year's integration of iOS and Android into the Microsoft graph and Cortana's positioning as its UI is the progression of an AI vision at Microsoft that had early roots in Microsoft Bob. So, no, Microsoft is not following Google's AI efforts. I believe, however, that Nadella's statement shifting Microsoft from a mobile-first, cloud-first motto is a deliberate public acknowledgment of his awareness of how important and competitive AI has become and will be. Considering Microsoft's already considerable investments in and previously communicated plans for AI, I believe Microsoft wanted the industry and competitors to know that, like Google, Redmond is all about AI.

Obviously Microsoft has decades worth of investments in AI and is not following Google's very respectable advancements in the area. What I found interesting as I watched Satya Nadella's Build 2017 keynote, however, was his very clear and deliberate departure from the mantra we Windows phone fans know all too well, "Mobile-first, Cloud-first", to an intelligence-driven (AI-driven) guidance. It immediately reminded me of Google's CEO Sundar Pichai's departure from a mobile-first, to an AI-first focus that he articulated a year ago. Clearly, Microsoft has had investments in AI for years, but only now is it placing the emphasis on AI as it's guidance as Google did last year. What do you think? Is Microsoft trying to make sure the industry and competitors know that it's AI strategy is a priority by placing it as the public guidance for the company, rather than Mobile-first, cloud-first philosophy (which Nadella articulates is still part of the company's strategy by the way)? The industry is increasingly AI-driven from IoT, mixed reality, Surveillance Tech and more. Public perception is a part of industry rival battles just technology advancement's and products. I think it was was for MS to "update" it's guiding philosophy to an AI-driven one to match it's investments and the industry's direction. Google's jump on this a year earlier of course, gives it the perception as being more forward-thinking here. What do you think? Was Microsoft being reactive here? Were they to slow to focus thier public message and philosophy with an alignment with it's AI investments allowing Google to position more aggressively as more forward thinking in regards to an AI-driven focus. LET'S TALK! 3 1 day ago Reply salazka AI  is very much Cloud First.  And of course, no, MS is not following Google's  "lead"  however Google is the most populist brand of all, and as such it has better success in marketing terms. More recognizeable. Beating someone in GO, is different than running an entire city with an AI heart, (IBM does that without a making much fuss about it,) or leading in image and voice recognition etc. etc. as Microsoft does. Cortana is not AI, not by a longshot, but it should be empowered by AI if Microsoft wants Cortana to thrive and their hidden deeply undergound marvels to come to the surface.  Last but not least, for AI to work, it needs a lot of data, data that is acquired by users as they go about their daily usage scenarios. And while google  has a "carte blanche" there, Microsoft is constantly a victim of endless ridiculous press bourne witchhunts. Microsoft continues to have a press problem, more conspicuous than before, but still there. Perhaps, unlike google they can't offer much to the various tech websites?  1 1 day ago Reply Joscelin Trouwborst Bingo! It is very much a natural progress and "Intelligent Cloud and Intelligent Edge" only better articulates the path we are following. It is not at all surprising that Google and more are following a like path. 0 5 hours ago Reply Drael646464 Machine learning programs are incredibly narrow. Because of this, various assistants will gain leads in specialised areas. Apple, MS and googles assistants will becomes "better at different things". MS seems to be focusing on natural language interactions. Googe appears to be focusing on expanding search functionality. Apple may also be heading into search IMO - they have invested in dark data AI AND partnered with IBM, to gain use of watson. I think google is smart to be AI first right now, because someone like apple could beat them at their own game with an AI that actually catergorizes content rather than uses markers. MS on on the other hand, like apple, and sony have the potential for AR/VR markets - because they have more powerful hardware under their platforms.  This is another reason why google has to be AI first - phones will not be a profit core of VR/AR. Googles best chance of future proofing itself is the IoT.  0 1 day ago Reply Stephen Townsley Microsoft isnt following Google's lead but heading to a different space. Google is strong in the consumer space. It occupies 80% of the smartphone market and it's devices are available globally. It's leveraging that Google AI is an "ambient presence" everywhere. Amazon is it's main competition with Alexa. Microsoft Cortana is only fully functional in the USA and only really present on the PC for all practical purposes. Microsoft are largely ignoring consumer and are hitting the enterprise sector using their on-premise dominance to move to hybrid and full cloud adoption. The Google consumer has a cheap TV solution in chromecast, a mobile phone solution, an assistant solution. The Microsoft consumer has a $400 Xbox One for movies, Cortana that is only fully enabled in the USA, no mobile platform for 99% of consumers and no home voice control interface. On the latter they are 18 months behind and are waiting for a partner to produce a "US Only" device. There is nothing wrong with being an enterprise company. Nadella's mission was not innovation but shareholder value.  The easiest way to summarise this is that you can get 5 installs for a family edition of Office 365 but Groove music still has no family plan after many years. It's not following Google but rather Microsoft is on a parallel track in which consumer isn't included. -1 13 hours ago Reply Urbautz Then i have a different Cortana than yours. It run's on my Lumia 950, it runs on my Blackberry DTEC50, it runs on my Surface 3. It even runs in my BMW iDrive when the phone is connected.  Also, i control my smart home via Homematic and Phillips Hue (both have 3rd party Cortana enabled apps) And the only piece of addintional hardware i needed for this is the Windows Hello Capable Webcam for my Desktop.    1 8 hours ago Reply Stephen Townsley Cortana is different in different markets. The US has the full feature set whereas the UK, where I am, doesn't support flight tracking from email messages. (Having said that I am flying on holiday at the weekend so I will see if it picks up on that) 0 8 hours ago Reply Sin Ogaris Cortana isn't even close to AI, it's a search engine with a few responses, it doesn't learn at, it just does what it's been programmed to do. 8 1 day ago Reply techiez and it doesnt yet work everywhr 6 1 day ago Reply Whodaboss In general I would agree.  But on my phone Cortana tells me before I leave home or work if the traffic is good or bad and how long it will take me to get there.  So in that sense it has learned how to provide information.  Sure I guess it is somewhat programmed to do that but still it's intuitive to provide feedback even when I'm not directly asking for it.  I still contend the Kinect could have been the precursor to all of this had Microsoft stayed focus on it long enough.  Oh well. 1 1 day ago Reply real0395 There is no actual AI anywhere at least on the consumer level. The point is to start working on developing that. 0 1 day ago Reply Drael646464 Of course, no assistants are primarily machine learning yet.

The article points to a shift some may not have known occurred in Nadella's guiding principal from the well known mobile-first cloud-first motto to an AI-focused one. It then frames that in a slightly broader context including one of Microsoft's main competitors (though there are others) who competes on the broadest range of similar services than any of MS other rivals: cloud, productivity, AI, hardware etc. (Other rivals compete with MS on less fronts.) Also, not all readers here, as MS fans, watch the competition as closely as others, so by providing the context of Googles AI foundations, progress and hardware strategy that is AI focused (whereas Microsoft's is UWP focused) readers can see where MS sits in relation to Google. This provokes critical thinking to see MS in relation to the broader picture rather than in a microcosm. Pointing then to Microsoft's long AI, machine learning, deep neural network history brings a history to the forefront that may be being overshadowed by Google's very public and consumer recognized AI efforts with Google Home, Assistant, ect. Some folks because Google's AI efforts are very consumer facing on the large Android platform may not realize the investments Microsoft has made and is making in AI. This article provides that information and perhaps let's some who think MS is following Google's AI strategy know, (because of thier consumer facing progress), that "No" MS is not following Google. You point out that I open with a question "is MS following Google and close with the response "No" they are not." And you then present that that partial conclusion (you missed the fuller answer as I pointed out at the beginning of this reply) as if a "No" somehow takes away from what is communicated. Would it have been better if, the answer were, "Yes, they are following Google?"🤔 1 1 day ago Reply techiez Neither yes MS is following Google nor No MS is not following google is correct. There was no need to start with a sensational headline. A simple headline that says AI - Ms and competition n than an article that explores what MS n Google are doing should have been enough.

The devices we bring along every day. That we interact most often with. Integration can only go so far if they do not own the platform and currently google is the one who does own it and so they will have a major advantage and give microsoft a hard time. They can only hope that the next big device-trend that will emerge from smartphones will be one, where their positon is stronger. Otherwise they will loose this battle pretty badly imo. 1 1 day ago Reply Lukas Taves I don't think they are following, they are certainly not an year late, Build 2016 was all about Inteligent cloud, Bots and AI for Ms as well, and that's been a trend ever since the Mobile First, Cloud First days.

Right near the article you answer the question. "So, no, Microsoft is not following Google's AI efforts." However, this smacks of yellow journalism. 0 1 day ago Reply ScubaDog It's really this simple (in idea, not necessarily execution): Microsoft needs to develop Cortana into what Jarvis is to Tony Stark.  Maybe not with that personality, but the ubiquitousness and the ability to be proactive as well as reactive.  Cortana still is best on the Windows phones.  But, as I've said many, many times, Cortana is NOT omnipresent.  She is multi-present.  She is a completely separate entity on ever single device you have her on. Which is why I will NOT waste my money on that stupid Harman-Kardon speaker. Yet another piece of hardware battling with my other hardware to hear, understand and react to my commands.  Microsoft's approach to AI will begin to mature when Cortana recognizes ME, absolutely uniquely, and does so as ONE entity regardless of how many devices are within earshot (or, eventually, visual range).  1 1 day ago Reply gchand05 Security however is a concern. The thought is that the more an AI knows about me, the more useful it is but at the cost of my personal security. I think Apple has a slight ACE up their sleave here. They state that security is its utmost importance. Consumers hear this and think that Siri is the the best AI even though it lacks features compared to Google and Microsoft. This could be damaging to microsofts efforts. How will they manage this narrative when to the consumer they are getting hit by malware/infections (ie. Wannacry) regularly and Apple keeps saying they are the most secure. 0 1 day ago Reply bebochek Apple can say whatever they want but that doesn't make it true.

I'm not alone in this opinion, I've read multiple articles stating the same thing. 0 1 day ago Reply Jason Ward Hi unmorphed actually I was comparing Googles Sunadar Pichai's statement from a 2016 interview (and the AI focus of I/O 2016 later in the piece) to Nadella's keynote statements this year, 2017. Excerpt from beginning of article: "Google's CEO Sundar Pichai said in an interview just before Google I/O *2016* that he's "on a journey from mobile to AI." The interview further expounded: "Pichai is also focused on shifting Google's journey from '*mobile-first to AI-first.'"* Thanks for jumping in!🙂 The advantage Google has is their consumer success. Google Now and Assistant have more mindshare than Cortana which from a consumers perspective makes it appear Googles ahead. Computer and cloud i intelligence is far deeper than assistants' as we know and Microsoft's platform position with integrating intelligence in products, Services etc is "invisible" to many consumers. Thanks again! 0 1 day ago Reply Drael646464 I think there might be more money here in enterprise. Farmers, manufacturers, labourers can all use IoT in a way that improves business. For the average person, turning the lights on when you get home, or playing your favourite tune when you get into the bath would be nice, but its more of a luxury, and as such, not as worth the expenditure. By contrast enterprise would spend millions, billions, for the right AI/IoT products.  That's not to say consumers won't use AI or IoT products, just that I doubt they'll have rapid product adoption, or be wildly profitable for quite some time yet. Makers would have to prove some functional or entertainment value. ATM its mostly gimmicky. I think google knows its in trouble. A large company like apple could take dark data (the internet), catergorize it into tags, and use those tags to match topic questions via AI (interestingly apple recently brought the former, and partnered into the later via IBM).   A purely content based search would beat a marker based one hands down. Perhaps thats a machine learning product that would be very hard to create, given its broader and more complex than most such applications, but if anyone ever makes one, and they have mindshare like apple does, they could kill googles core business virtually overnight.  0 1 day ago Reply Drael646464 Just as interestingly Apple also hired a project manager for a "search engine capable of supporting hundreds of millions of users", or at least placed an ad for such, back in 2015. Google ought to be focusing less on hobbies like daydream, chromeOS and android - and instead watching their back. If apple makes a superior search based on AI, it could be very very bad for google.   0 1 day ago Reply Drael646464 Also this -https://www.macrumors.com/2017/05/26/apple-neural-engine-ai-chip/   0 1 day ago Reply vEEP pEEP Google is doing very cool things!  I like Google Lens.

I hope MS extends this to all their machine learning efforts - we really do not want cloud latencies for every machine learning based task. Yes its handy, if your machine (like a phone) doesn't have the juice, but if your machine does - why should we suffer the delays?  0 1 day ago Reply johnh3 We will see. But I think Google and Amazon got a strong start with voice speakers. I am afraid that Cortana will meet the same faith as Windows Phone/Mobile, out to late to compete. Microsoft in general are early in to ideas but very slow to act. Look at Android, Audi and Volvo will built in that system in the car. So Google is much in to IoT, machin learning stuff.  But who know, maybe Nadella will pull it of.

I feel you might be thoroughly versed in Google and Apple's efforts and largely just beginning research on Microsoft's efforts via build or others?    Some AI related questions that might broaden this article.  Why did MS choose the more expensive FPGA option instead of Google going the cheaper route.  How would that infrastructure  affect AI?  Does Google have similar cognitive services available? Tensor-flow how does it compare  Does Apple?  Are they available for all devs to work on or just a feature on their app?  Does Google have an IOT program like MS-IOT, are cognitive services or AI available for them?  What is intelligent edge does their competitors have something similar, how are they different?  We now have cortana skills how is it different from alexa's skills, do other competitors have it as well.  bot framework, what is it, how did it come to be, how is it different from wechat (the first messaging app to employ bots) and how does it use AI?  Then you could wrap it all up.       AI is more than just digital assistants.   0 17 hours ago Reply Jason Ward Thanks for the feedback, Kram.

Free land in OpenSim VR Headsets VR QR Codes Maria's Worlds / VR & AR Creating a Cardboard QR code by Maria Korolov · November 7, 2015 Update: There are now apps you can use that make it easier to create a new Google Cardboard QR Code. One we tried out recently is Sites in VR. Read our review here. I recently ordered Baofeng Small Mojing virtual reality headset from AliExpress. They start at $12, with free shipping, and come in a variety of colors. I got the pink ones. Baofeng Small Mojing in pink and purple.   Unfortunately, they did not come with a Google Cardboard QR code. This is a symbol that you use to calibrate your headset, so that Google Cardboard virtual reality apps and YouTube movies show up as best as possible. Google, unfortunately, was not my friend — apparently, this particular QR code had not yet been uploaded by anyone. But I’m not someone who’s just willing to sit around and wait for other people to do the work. Especially when I can get a blog post out of it. And there’s a QR Code Generator that Google has created for folks to use. Of course, this generator is designed to be used by the manufacturers themselves, but it turned out that it wasn’t too difficult for a mere human to do it, either. Getting started with the Viewer Profile Generator. I loaded up the official website on my computer, then picked up my smartphone — a Samsung Galaxy S6, pulled up a QR code reader app, and scanned the QR code. Or you could also type in the URL provided. It opened up a tool on my smartphone that is synched with the form on my computer screen. The phone loaded the tool and asked me for the “pixels per inch” value of my device. I Googled “samsung galaxy s6 pixels per inch” and got 577. Easy enough. It asked me to touch the screen to switch to full-screen view, then I got a bunch of lines on the screen. Viewer calibration screen. Now, back to the website on my computer. I skipped the part about adding my company name and device name, since I’m not the actual manufacturer — and I still have hopes that the manufacturer themselves will come through and create an official code.   Google’s Viewer Profile Generator for Google Cardboard-compatible headsets. So, first, it asked me for the primary button type. This headset doesn’t have any buttons — but it does allow me to touch the screen. That’s probably as good as having a touch-style button on the headset itself, so I selected “touch.” Then it asked me for the screen-to-lens distance. I’m supposed to use calipers to measure this. Measuring the distance between the viewer’s lenses and the smartphone screen. (Image courtesy Google.) I don’t own a pair of calipers, but I do have measuring tape. I got 55 millimeters. Then they had me measure the distance from the center of one lens to the center of the other. That came out to 65 millimeters. My lenses were adjustable, so, per their instructions, I set them at the middle setting for this measurement. Then they asked me how the phone is aligned. Some headsets — like the FireFly — have the phone positioned so that it’s centered in all directions. As you can see with this particular set, however, the phone is just dropped in and sits at the bottom of the two clips. So I chose “bottom” for the vertical alignment. Then they had me measure the distance from the bottom of the tray — in my case, the bottom of those clips — to the center of the lenses. That came out to 40 millimeters in this particular case. Now comes the tricky part — the distortion coefficients. This is what adjusts for the curvature of the lenses. Here is where the magic happens. Since the online form is synched to the tool running on the smartphone, you can adjust the coefficients — using the little up and down arrows — and see the immediate effect on the phone. I adjusted the k1 value up and down and a value of 0.15 seemed to work the best. Then I did the same for k2, and got 0.22. That was it. I clicked the “Generate Profile” button and got my QR code: Baofeng Small Mojing QR Code qr_viewer_profile I added this code to my QR Codes page, for anyone else to use. I’m going to follow the same process and create QR codes for other headsets in my collection that don’t have official QR codes released yet. Do you have a headset that you created a QR code for?

I’ve generated QRs adapted to my headsets for two positions of the lenses: “centered” position (62mm) and “near” position (57mm). Maybe you want to add them to your QR collection as alternative QRs for this headset… Maria Korolov Could also be because I have weird eyes! This is why I haven’t been making as many QR codes as I could be — I have a different prescription on each eye. Thanks for the QR Codes! Maria Korolov A reader sent me this image, that may be useful for people calibrating their Cardboard-compatible viewers, which you can download here: http://www.hypergridbusiness.com/download/vr-test-image-file/ It’s a 3D image, so I can’t just attach it here. You’ll also need a special app to display it, MPO Viewer for Cardboard: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dmitrybrant.android.cardboardmpo&hl=en Nicolas Eshraghi I have the fiit vr headset and i have made so many profiles and looked all over the internet but no qr codes work for me please help! Maria Korolov What problems are you getting when you use the FiiT QR Code from our QR Codes page? http://www.hypergridbusiness.com/faq/vr-headset-qr-codes/ Are you able to successfully recognize the QR Code with your Google Cardboard app and switch viewers? Do you have a particular kind of distortion of the image? Nicolas Eshraghi I still have double vision when I use it Maria Korolov Double vision can also be caused by the smartphone not being perfectly centered in the viewer. One thing you can try is moving the smartphone to the right or left a little bit, while looking through the viewer, and seeing if that helps the double vision issue. Another reason is that your eyes could be farther apart or closer together than the headset makers planned for. on the FiiT, you should be able to move the lenses closer or farther apart — does that help? Another possibility is that there’s something about the combination of you, your smartphone, the viewer, and the QR Code that just doesn’t work. Can you try the headset using someone else’s smartphone? Can you have someone else try the viewer? And do all the FiiT QR codes cause the same double-vision effect for you? Here are the QR Codes again. Alvin Hey, can you help me to generate the qr code for gruu vr kit? Thanks Maria Korolov This one here? http://www.unomax.com/gruuvr It’s just a rebranded Ritech Riem II.

Devanshu Sharma i got cardboard from http://getcardboard.in/w/product/google-cardboard-virtual-reality-kit-fully-assembled/ I can’t find any Qr code anywhere please help Maria Korolov This looks like a standard Google Cardboard V1 type headset. Here is a code that might work for you. bobo iv recently bought baofeng mojing d 3d and there isnt a qr code that works with google cardboard. Is it possible for anyone to find the qr code for it thanks in advance Maria Korolov Sorry, I don’t have this headset, so I can’t create a QR Code for it for you, and haven’t seen one anywhere online. You can create your own — it only takes a few minutes — like I did in the story above. Or you can do what I do when I get a new headset without a QR Code, and just go through the codes on this page until I find one that works: http://www.hypergridbusiness.com/faq/vr-headset-qr-codes/ Chara Dreemur Hey, so this is my headset. https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01FU98R1E/ref=cm_sw_r_sms_c_api_FkOFxbQR77QQC It does not come with a qr code, but it looks like it’s a rebranded baofang mojing 3, so I need clarification if that QR code would work for it. Thank you! Ananthu can you help me with domo vr7??? I can’t find the QR code Zanov Could you do a qr code for the Allie VR cardboard if you have it if you don’t I can gladly just purchase a standard Google one Thanks! Edward Winslow Please help! I can’t even find a website for mine. I have the Neutab Virtual Reality headset bought off of amazon. Not sure it it came from amazon or a amazon seller! Tried your method and i just cant figure out how to measure well all of it. my lenses move in and out. how do i measure that and the distance from phone to lenses? my goggles have a slide in tray. also with my phone the Lg G4 I can not enter into full screen mode! Maria Korolov Do you mean this one here? https://www.amazon.com/NeuTab-VR-Immersive-experience-Smartphone/dp/B01IE23LME That’s a rebranded VR Box 2. One of the ones below should work for you: Edward Winslow Thank you for the quick response and help! Thank you! Maria Korolov There’s a bunch of things out there called VR Max. Do you mean this one? https://www.amazon.com/VR-MAX-Augmentation-Cardboard-Cellphones/dp/B01EY2I7W2 If so, it’s a rebranded Bobo VR Z3. Here you go: Illtud Any luck with that? I get double vision on my Tiger headset as well and googled for a Profile and got to your post. DanCJ This is the best I managed. To get rid of the double vision in some apps I had to lie to the generator about the distance between the lenses, but it seems to work okay. I printed it out and sellotape it to the inside of my goggles for easy access. Maria Korolov Thanks! I just added it to my QR codes page: http://www.hypergridbusiness.com/faq/vr-headset-qr-codes/ Eduardo Guzmán Do you have the qr code for xiaomi vr??? I dnt find in every internet! Thanks!! Maria Korolov I do! and I’m about to post a review of the headset, which arrived in the mail today. I tried out the code, and it worked well for me.

Maria Korolov I can’t find it on the web — can you send me a link to its purchase page? anand raj Hi, I have Lenovo Vibe K5 plus and VR box 2.0 but while play the VR games it’s not working properly it’s seems multiple display, Can any help me with suitable QR Code Maria Korolov I have a couple of VR Box 2 QR Codes on this page: http://www.hypergridbusiness.com/2016/06/13-open-sided-vr-headsets/ https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/90da10340c177371af00439b33e73111727ce039cee0bb91307263b5524cb38b.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/9b526c623a24b4733a2efbf94e04ed7488b82f48828b8e0bd9e0a28b78446d93.png Eddie Error in parsing url. Maria Korolov That was weird. Here is the QR codes page again: http://www.hypergridbusiness.com/faq/vr-headset-qr-codes/ Gil I’m not very tech savvy but I don’t understand what to do with these QR codes… I have a Samsung S7 and a Gear VR… I used it already without any kind of QR code. Also, I may be getting a Fiit VR 2S to use with non-Oculus VR Apps. How do you use the QR code and how will it affect how the phone works with the Gear VR? Can I go back and forth or do I need to do something with the QR code each time I change headsets? Thanks in advance… Maria Korolov The Gear VR is a separate thing, and talks to the phone via a wired connection. It is totally completely separate from the Google Cardboard ecosystem — uses different apps, different standards, different app store, different sensors, everything. A standard Google Cardboard-type viewer doesn’t have any built-in electronics and can’t talk to the phone, so it can’t tell the phone how the lenses are set up, etc… So the QR Code tells the phone how to adjust the picture so that it looks right in your headset. Here is how to use it: http://www.hypergridbusiness.com/2016/06/how-to-set-up-your-new-mobile-vr-viewer/ Artur Khisamov Flying Tiger shops now sell cheap plastic VR headset (GBP7 in UK) pretty descent for the price.

Arrun Bawa Hi I got the Kellogs Krave VR system do u have the QR code for it? much appreciated Maria Korolov I haven’t seen the QR Code for it anywhere.

You can also try to contact the distributor who sent it to you. DuhDUDE I bought a DVV Dynamic Virtual Viewer. Can u make a QR code for it Maria Korolov Sorry, but I don’t have one of those headsets!

Now that’s changing as multiple assistants proliferate to multiple phones. It sounds like an epidemic case of multiple-personality disorder but it’s actually a step toward a future in which the artificially intelligent entities will take over our gadgets and make them more powerful and easier to use. Google Assistant, the unimaginatively named software that pops up on Android phones when you say “OK Google”, is now available for iPhones. You can’t ask it to take a selfie or perform some other tasks — Apple keeps that functionality for its own Siri — but you are free to enjoy its superior speech-recognition technology. With some technical skill, you can also run Google Assistant on Windows systems alongside the native digital assistant, Cortana (which, in turn, has been available on Android and iOS for a while). Since millions of people are using Alexa, the helpful voice inside the Echo speaker, smartphone maker HTC’s new flagship phone, the U11, responds to both “OK Google” and “Alexa!”. Samsung’s Galaxy S8, for its part, includes both Google Assistant and the Korean company’s own Bixby. In other words, the digital assistants are getting untethered from makers and even operating systems. Soon, they will supersede them: The assistant becomes the primary interface, and the user doesn’t really care about what’s under the hood unless he or she is a determined geek. But that shift is predicated on improvements to voice interaction technology that have eluded developers so far. Whatever the makers of these systems claim about their voice recognition technology, it’s highly imperfect — there are lots of funny examples on Reddit’s r/SiriFail. So Google is adding keyboard input support to Assistant, and camera support will also come soon, the company announced at its developer conference. That means we’ll be able to train the phone’s camera on a flower or a building, and it’ll tell us what it is, or translate text from a foreign language without a special app. The idea is that the digital assistant will do all the work for the user. If you want to post to Facebook, for example, you won’t need to open the app — the assistant will give you a window to do it; if you’re trying to figure out if the restaurant in front of you is worth entering, you won’t need to google it or bring up the Yelp app, just train the camera on the sign and the assistant will give you all the relevant information. The benefits for the user are obvious. Eventually, it may become unnecessary to install apps on a phone — the assistant will just pull the necessary data from various services in the cloud. Digital assistant developers, for their part, can point users toward their own services, something vitally important for Google and Amazon but also helpful for Microsoft and Apple. Sure, that will probably prompt antitrust complaints, but regulators are taking years to consider such cases even with more easy-to-understand technology. In 2010, the European Commission started its investigation of how Google allegedly prioritises its own shopping comparison service in search results; the case is still dragging on. By the time it’s over, new technology will be in place that may take watchdogs another decade to parse, and since the assistants are powered by artificial intelligence, developers will have a new defence: These algorithms have a life of their own, and it won’t always be possible to completely control their choices. Now, people hardly ever use the digital assistants on desktop and laptop computers, very often on home speakers and not that frequently on phones. Talking to a gadget when you’re not driving a car remains a turn-off for many people (and for me, definitely). Only 18 per cent of smartphone users call up the assistants daily. The speakers, however, will be niche products for a long time. Not everyone can think of a use for them. Phones, however, are ubiquitous — and suddenly the whole market is up for grabs for the company that develops the perfect digital assistant and makes it the interface of choice. That’s why Samsung, for example, believes it can get in the game — and why Amazon is already in it. The mission is far from trivial. Artificial intelligence needs training to get better, and that means more interactions with humans. Companies need to entice customers to use highly imperfect products. That takes a lot of hype and some quick improvement, otherwise disappointed phone users will drift away. Google and Amazon appear to be the most determined developers at this point, but there’s still time (not that much) for Apple and Microsoft to catch up. In the end, getting the digital assistants to take over our gadgets is a collaborative effort between developers, users and machine-learning algorithms. It’s not quite clear yet if a complete takeover is even possible; that depends on whether the algorithms ever get as good at giving us what we want as we are at getting it manually (an increasingly relative term). But given the enormous resources being invested into this play, it’s likely to bring about change in the way we use our communication devices even if it doesn’t succeed 100 per cent.

Google is now offering four free months of Google Play Music for new subscribers Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/26 2:17pm PDTMay 26, 2017 70 Plus 1 on G+ 511 Share on Facebook 83 Share on Twitter Total Shares664 Google News Right now it looks like Google is running a special offer for Google Play Music. New subscribers that sign up here can get four free months of service instead of the usual three. No telling how long this offer might last, so if you have been considering subscribing, now might be the time to do it. It could save you an extra $10. Again, this particular offer is only for new subscribers. I've been a fan of Play Music for a long time, though the device removal limit does get in the way when you switch between devices and ROMs as often as I do. Being able to mix your own library with those of a service also comes in handy. That way I can continue to support artists I am passionate about, without eschewing the larger selection of a subscription offering for the purposes of content discovery, all while being able to fill the gaps in that library. There are a lot of different music services out there, but if you're interested combining your curated library with music available via a subscription, then your options are limited. Spotify does allow you to play back locally stored files, which is convenient, but it isn't quite the same. Amazon also allows you to upload your music for playback via Amazon Music, and with Amazon Prime membership, you get a small library of streaming music to go along with that. For $10 a month ($8 for Prime members) you can access their full library as well. But, Google Play Music has a great interface and plugs nicely into all the other Google services we love. Maybe with this new offer, it's time you gave Google Play Music a chance? After all, even if it doesn't end up working out, you still got four free months of music out of the deal.

I have a secondary account based in England as part of a mail forwarder service I use, and my bf is Greek so I had him check the code on his account :) Carson Saldanha Oh wow! Carson Saldanha Hey, since I know it worked for you, are you able to use YouTube Red along with this Play Music free trial? Because my YT Red doesn't seem to be enabled for me. Ailín Ó’S No, unfortunately not as I live in the EU and YouTube Red is only available in USA. Carson Saldanha Weird, I'm in the US though. Ailín Ó’S Ooh that is odd. Sign out of the app then sign back in maybe? Carson Saldanha No luck :( I'm in contact with Google support atm Hopefully they can sort this out Mike Worth it alone for Youtube Red MisterAlex Sweet, I wasn't sure if that was included. Thanks. Should mention that in the main blog post. Ben Still no student membership >:( Ailín Ó’S Spotify is a great alternative @€$£5/month. Ben I know that's what I use just because it's half the price. Ailín Ó’S In Ireland Vodafone have a partnership with Spotify whereby it costs €5 standard instead of €10 regardless of if you're a student or not, they even bundle it with some of their plans. Vodafone do the same in some other countries they operate in (not all). Maybe see if any network in your country has a partnership like that? Worth a shot! Ben Oh yeah I'm on EE in the UK and I've got Apple Music for free for 6 months but like iTunes is a massive stinking turd. Ailín Ó’S I'd rather go back to the days of getting music via Bluetooth from friends than use crApple Music 😂😂 Rahul Krishna In india, we have play music for 1.4 usd/month Umang Ladia I'm only seeing 2 months offer in India.?? Rahul Krishna Well I subscribed to it when it launched here (about 2 months ago), so I can't confirm that. But at this price, there is nothing to be disappointed about. aRvInD I wish Spotify launches soon here. I can't keep using that patched version here...!! Rahul Krishna Me too xyz As it should be, you can't charge European or American prices in India. Rahul Krishna Yes true. There are lots​ of people here with a very cheap Android phone. They cannot pay much money. Julian Coronado That's actually what's keeping me away from Play Music. I've used my free months and I loved the Youtube Red too. But as a student, Spotify for $5 / month is too great to pass up on. Emiliejmosley Google is paying 97$ per hour!

Cakefish Spotify ftw ToniCipriani ✓pǝᴉɟᴉɹǝʌ I don't think this is a new offer, got this a while back. In fact my 4 months is expiring next week. Prefer Spotify over it. Song selection a tad bit weaker, and for foreign songs it tries to translate the song names to English and makes it hard to look up. folkrav I like it, it's way cheaper than Spotify for me - my mother, my sister, my wife and myself each pay 30$ a year and we're set - but Jesus do I hate the clients. I don't like the website's interface, I hate the Android app. But yeah, I'll deal with it cause it's cheap, I guess. Carson Saldanha Got it! Yay! Jim I wish I could somehow get it on my Amazon Echo hahaha. I guess if I had paid for a Google Home it would be worth trying out. Forget vega #getEVGA Why google play music isn't available in my country ? Ailín Ó’S Try Apple Music? They seem to be just about everywhere. Iamsecond And this is why Apple continue to dominate, because Apple are truly interested in being an international company whereas Google is just playing at it. Such a shame xyz Because Google sucks. Bartek Juszczak My GPM radio's are so good these days I love that Google is so into AI. Whether It's just "I'm being lucky" or radio from a specific song, band or album they very rarely disappoint me these days. I just make sure to thumbs up if it plays a song I particularly love. I am a student and could go cheaper with spotify but the AI generated playlists have me locked in. If it's £5 cheaper but I'm not gonna enjoy it nearly as much then it's not really a good deal. AndTheWorldMayNeverKnow I used the 3 or 4 months free trial during the holidays then bought the family plan for $14.99 a month. 4 people in my family us it and it works great, the app could use some tweaks but it's really good overall. paev If you listen to main stream music it doesn't really matter what service to use. However, if you like something unusual, weird or other languages then Google is a way to go. I found bands on Google music that Spotify displayed as not found. Google also have new synth bands that Spotify doesn't. I'm for Google too. Daniel I discovered that GPM is kinda like a music label. I once went to a section of Google play explaining how indie artists can use GPM like a music label as long as they own all their rights. Ryne Hager Ultraista (among others) keeps me using Google Play Music as well as Spotify. Carson Saldanha Does anyone else who activated the Play Music trial have YouTube Red working as well? My YT Red doesn't seem to be enabled while my Play Music is. Michael Carr I spotted a similar offer a couple of months ago, and I took it after a day or two's thought. Just last week, I moved directly into a family plan. PewPewYoureDead It's hard to recommend Google Play Music until they revamp the UI. Margaritas Ante Porcos Google Music is the only choice in some markets, like Russia, where no Spotify or Pandora are available. There are too many shortcomings in Google Music and Google never shows interest in making services better than below average. I really wonder why Google refuses to become the best at anything. Real magic here. Pixel syndrome all the way. Yet Google Music is on my phone and I use it because there's no choice whatsoever. Rob You answered your own question. If there's no alternative, then they don't have any incentive to improve the service. SupahNin10doh Stupid Dorito logo... Raymond Berger Huh, I just subscribed to the trial but you youtube red hasn't kicked in yet. Any idea how long it takes? Iamsecond If you live in the UK, about 2 years so far h20ray Google Play Music is currently available in select territories and for select account types. Umang Ladia I'm only seeing 2 months offer in India, anybody can confirm? Mohammad Ovais Yeah, same for me. Maybe it's region limited. Isolde I think you need to open the link in a browser, if you open it in the app it's just the normal 2 months. Manoj | Blogging Triggers Is Google Music really worth to it? We have better alternatives Sathiya Moorthy Karan I came across a great post, it seems to be so cool http://developeit.net/android-news-image-scanner-finder/ Zachariah Mann It only shows up as 2 free months for me.

Tab out frome a game for pause music when the round is over is just bad. Arif Gürü And stil isnt available on Turkey xyz "No telling how long this offer might last, so if you have been considering subscribing, now might be the time to do it." No thanks, I'll just use YouTube. Only thing YT needs is an option to play audio only so I can save a wee bit more data when I don't need video.

Suggested Sharing is going live in Google Photos for some users Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/25 5:30pm PDTMay 25, 2017 42 Plus 1 on G+ 112 Share on Facebook 75 Share on Twitter Total Shares229 Applications Google News Google Photos is ground zero for the company's crazy machine learning technology. At Google I/O 2017, a number of new features were announced for Photos, including suggested sharing based on who's in a certain photo. But for that to work, Google needs to figure out who is who, and now the Photos web app is asking users to identify what they look like. Upon visiting photos.google.com, you may be welcomed by the above screen. Google already uses machine learning wizardry to match faces to people, so all you have to do is select which face is yours. Once you do that, you'll be able to search for "me" in the Photos search to find pictures of yourself. According to a recent teardown, this option should appear at some point in the Photos app as well, but it didn't for me. Presumably, this will be far more useful once the other features announced at Google I/O show up. Let us know in the comments if you have received the pop-up.

I got the pop up just the other day. I can search for "me" in addition to others such as my daughter's name. John Doe I did but for some reason it shows a photo of me from over 6 years ago even though I have plenty of recent photos LoL Corbin Davenport Yep, my picture was an awful photo of me from several years ago. John Doe I was able to change it by going to people then clicking on the picture and even when you choose a picture with a lot of people in it figures out which one is you and zooms in...creepy bozzykid It doesn't matter what photo you choose of yourself. The rest are all linked to you anyways. This isn't replacing your profile pic. John Doe No but some photos it has not figured out its me or at least when I click on me it doesn't show all the pictures of me but it is good enough to find pictures of me when I was a child which is crazy because I changed a lot. Stakoman Is this US only? would be great if you guys made a "how to enable face recognition google photos" post Suicide_Note Use a US VPN to start using the face recognition. Once you get things setup, you can stop using the VPN, though face recognition should still work. rndusrnm479461 You can use a VPN (get tunnelbear cause it's free) for Android, then clear cache, open photos and enable grouping of faces in the settings. Then you can disable VPN. I did this about a year ago and I've had it ever since without any problem both on Android and on the web. bozzykid I believe it uses one of the firsts photos you have stored. It has already linked the rest to you anyways. Régis Knechtel Not always, apparently, cause it used a recent photo for me. I think it's random. Brendapdaniels Google is paying 97$ per hour!

Defenestratus No. Régis Knechtel "his option should appear at some point in the Photos app as well" It asked to chose my face me today in the android app, while I was setting up a new phone. jcopernicus I accidentally closed the prompt...how to I get it back? Corbin Davenport On the web, go to Settings -> Group similar faces, and there should be an option to pick your face. Yatin No, I'm from India Drakenoid Yes, I'm also from India. Naga Sridhar I am from India too, but are you in India? myssi Pop-up recieved, I'm from Pakistan. Tomáš Petrík And I guess we will be left out in the EU, again :/ Indefinite Implosion I'm in NL and got it a few days ago? A day or two after the announcement maybe (crunch time, so days are a blur). I didn't tip because it doesn't do anything right now so hardly seems worthy of a post. roberto.elena Do you already have "group similar faces" activated? If yes, then you will get this update. Tomáš Petrík No, it is disabled for accounts registered in the EU due to some stupid privacy ruling of the EU. roberto.elena I know, but you can activate it using a VPN (or at least that was possible when they launched Google Photos). Once it's activated, you don't need the VPN anymore, and you get all updates related to face recognition features. Nelson Not correct. I'm in Europe and by using Opera VPN plus Google Photos cache clear the feature appeared Amir Instead of copying and pasting your Debbie Downer response on every single comment, go try it with a VPN. Gosh! Suicide_Note Use a US VPN and you can join the party. Tomáš Petrík It's not about VPN this time. Accounts registered in the EU have facial recognition disabled due to some stupid privacy ruling of the EU. Jens Törnblad That's why you activate the feature with a VPN. Suicide_Note Ah, okay. I wasn't aware of that. Definitely sucks. Mr K Nope. I cleaned data from Google Photos and force closed, activated Tunnelbear (it's free for 500MB but you won't use more than 50) in the US and opened Photos. Configured everything (make sure face recognition" is activated in settings) and everything works fine. I just got the notification in Photos for web about this new feature. And you can of course uninstall the VPN when everything is set up. rndusrnm479461 Get tunnelbear for Android. Choose a US vpn. Clear Google Photos cache -> open it -> enable grouping of faces in the settings. You only have to do this once. I did it a year ago and it has worked ever since on all my devices. Tomáš Petrík It's not about VPN this time, though. Accounts registered in the EU have facial recognition disabled due to some stupid privacy ruling of the EU. rndusrnm479461 Really? I registered mine in EU in ~2008 and activated face grouping in early 2016 without problems. henleyb I got it a day or two ago. Was an old photo but searching for 'me' did bring up correct photos for me so that's something. Looking forward to the sharing stuff next. :) Suicide_Note Haven't seen this popup yet, but on a related note, photo books have gone live for me in the Photos app. Taylor Hardy I work from ease of my residence, with the help of easy jobs that merely usually requires from you a Computer system and even on-line connection and I am also more successful than ever before...

Photo / Getty Images Apple got an early start in artificial intelligence with the 2011 introduction of Siri, a tool that lets users operate their smartphones with voice commands. Now the electronics giant is bringing artificial intelligence to chips. Apple is working on a processor devoted specifically to AI-related tasks, according to a person familiar with the matter. The chip, known internally as the Apple Neural Engine, would improve the way the company's devices handle tasks that would otherwise require human intelligence -- such as facial recognition and speech recognition, said the person, who requested anonymity discussing a product that hasn't been made public. Apple declined to comment. Engineers at Apple are racing to catch their peers at Amazon.com and Alphabet in the booming field of artificial intelligence. While Siri gave Apple an early advantage in voice-recognition, competitors have since been more aggressive in deploying AI across their product lines, including Amazon's Echo and Google's Home digital assistants. An AI-enabled processor would help Cupertino, California-based Apple integrate more advanced capabilities into devices, particularly cars that drive themselves and gadgets that run augmented reality, the technology that superimposes graphics and other information onto a person's view of the world. "Two of the areas that Apple is betting its future on require AI," said Gene Munster, former Apple analyst and co-founder of venture capital firm Loup Ventures. "At the core of augmented reality and self-driving cars is artificial intelligence." Improved Performance Continued below.

Philippines at a grave risk of "contamination" by Isis Ecostore takes legal action against former employee Apple devices currently handle complex artificial intelligence processes with two different chips: the main processor and the graphics chip. The new chip would let Apple offload those tasks onto a dedicated module designed specifically for demanding artificial intelligence processing, allowing Apple to improve battery performance. Should Apple bring the chip out of testing and development, it would follow other semiconductor makers that have already introduced dedicated AI chips. Qualcomm Inc's latest Snapdragon chip for smartphones has a module for handling artificial intelligence tasks, while Google announced its first chip, called the Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), in 2016. That chip worked in Google's data centers to power search results and image-recognition. At its I/O conference this year, Google announced a new version that will be available to clients of its cloud business. Nvidia also sells a similar chip to cloud customers. The Apple AI chip is designed to make significant improvements to Apple's hardware over time, and the company plans to eventually integrate the chip into many of its devices, including the iPhone and iPad, according to the person with knowledge of the matter. Apple has tested prototypes of future iPhones with the chip, adding that it's unclear if the component will be ready this year. Apple's operating systems and software features would integrate with devices that include the chip. For example, Apple has considered offloading facial recognition in the photos application, some parts of speech recognition, and the iPhone's predictive keyboard to the chip, the person said. Apple also plans to offer developer access to the chip so third-party apps can also offload artificial intelligence-related tasks, the person said. Developer Conference Apple may choose to discuss some of its latest advancements in AI at its annual developer's conference in June. At the same conference, Apple plans to introduce iOS 11, its new operating system for iPhones and iPads, with an updated user-interface, people with knowledge of the matter said last month. The company is also said to discuss updated laptops with faster chips from Intel. An AI chip would join a growing list of processors that Apple has created in-house. The company began designing its own main processors for the iPhone and iPad in 2010 with the A4 chip. It has since released dedicated processors to power the Apple Watch, the motion sensors across its products, the wireless components inside of its AirPods, and the fingerprint scanner in the MacBook Pro. The company has also tested a chip to run the low-power mode on Mac laptops. In 2015, Bloomberg reported that Apple's culture of secrecy stymied the iPhone maker's ability to attract top AI research talent. Since then, Apple has acquired multiple companies with deep ties to artificial intelligence, has begun publishing papers related to AI research, has joined a key research group and has made hires from the field. In October 2016, Apple hired Russ Salakhutdinov from Carnegie Mellon University as its director of AI research.

Deals: Drive Around Safely With This Hands-Free Phone Mount Six Ways To Get A Cheaper Deal At JB Hi-Fi Browse These 15 Hidden Netflix Genres Tonight Ditch Apple's Generic Keyboard With These Apps Patrick Lucas Austin May 27, 2017, 1:00pm ⋅ Filed to:  android iphone keyboards utilities Share In terms of functionality, Apple's generic, preloaded keyboard has certainly improved, but even after adding its own App Store, complete with stickers and apps, it's still a little bland. What I do love about Apple is its support for third-party keyboards. You can ditch the generic offering and download enough keyboards for every conceivable customisation option you want. Image credit: John Moore/Getty Keep in mind you don't have to commit. Don't be afraid to install more than one keyboard! If I'm looking for some particular animated image I'll use GIPHY Keys more than Gboard, but during normal texting hours or when typing in a note-taking app like Bear, swipe-friendly keyboards are my tool of choice. Gboard (Android, iOS) Google's keyboard (available for iOS and Android) is packed with just enough features to be useful but not too many to be cumbersome or unwieldy. It's been my keyboard of choice since its debut, thanks to its simple search integration: In true Google fashion, you can search from the keyboard itself and send links as well as descriptive cards to recipients. Its responsive swipe functionality is great for popping in and out, while other keyboards I've tried in the past were somewhat sluggish in acknowledging my swiping as spelling. You can pull images and GIFs from Gboard to send or save (though the results sometimes differ between its desktop and Gboard searches). Sure, you can type on it like a traditional keyboard, but Gboard also features glide typing — swiping your finger across letters to spell words — just like Swype and Swiftkey, and it learns from your history to improve its predictive search and text suggestion without transmitting personal data to the company. If you're on a bigger phone, the combination of glide typing and a one-handed typing setting on Gboard is a godsend, and makes texting easier and less stressful on your weak human form. Like talking to your phone? Gboard supports text dictation just like Apple's keyboard. Gboard for Android packs in a few more extra features than its iOS counterpart, including language auto-detection complete with autocorrect and suggested text, as well as live translation. Word Flow (iOS) Unfortunately Word Flow is not yet in the Australian store, but we figured it still deserved a shout out for its unique design. Made by a team in Microsoft's experimental Garage division, Word Flow's easy one-handed use lets me knock some text off even while straphanging. Its standout feature is its curved keyboard mode: The keyboard sits in the corner of your screen and makes it easy for your thumb to reach every letter. You can even glide type while it's curved, and see its suggested text (though the curvature reduces the selection choice list). The built-in web search powered by Bing lets you copy and paste images and GIFs, too. If you're suffering from thumb trouble during your typing sessions or just want to be able to reach your keys without two hands, then this is definitely a keyboard to test. 60 Keyboard Shortcuts For Popular Office Apps (Infographic) Of course, you may not need all 60 of these, but knowing them will make you flexible, fast, and ready to work with whatever tool you're presented with, whether it's a Windows PC, a Mac, an Excel spreadsheet, or a Powerpoint slideshow. Plus, there are extras in here for Gmail and Chrome to boot. Read more Swiftkey (Android, iOS) With SwiftKey, Microsoft now has two different keyboards in Apple's app store. Swiftkey just got a much-needed redesign and with it a more minimal, functional look. It's also more responsive than before, registering swipes quickly enough. It supports swipe typing like Gboard and Word Flow, and custom themes in case you want to add colours to your keycaps. Hooking Swiftkey up to your Facebook or Google account gives it access to your data (it's encrypted before leaving your device, and Swiftkey doesn't have your login information) that it uses to personalise your autocorrect functionality as well as predictive text suggestions. It will even show you how it's adjusting your typing style and how much time you're saving by not tapping away at letters. It also has a few tricks up its sleeve if you're looking to expand your language options — a recent update boosted support to over 100 languages. GIPHY Keys (iOS) I like GIFs. You like GIFs. We all like GIFs. Why not use a GIF-friendly keyboard? In terms of typing, you won't find anything revolutionary here. You'll be tapping away just like before. Giphy Keys isn't as full-featured as Gboard, nor does it feature glide typing functionality like Swype. It's cute, though — and it blows the competition out of the water in terms of GIF search functionality. Giphy is the gold standard of GIF integration across the web, especially since it lets you access the Betaworks company's repository of both pop culture and original GIF content through its slew of categories — or you can search them yourself from the keyboard.

Chris Jager 27 May 2017 5:00 PM The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) has released its average weekly earnings report which does exactly what it says on the tin. By taking the average weekly earnings and multiplying them by 52, it's possible to work out the average annual wage in Australia. Here's how much you should be earning.

[Update: Now $75 Off] Deal Alert: Pixel 32GB (international version) is $50 off on eBay Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/05/26 2:20pm PDTMay 26, 2017 2 Plus 1 on G+ 42 Share on Facebook 56 Share on Twitter Total Shares100 Deals News Pixel Update 1: 2017/05/26 2:32pm PDT It looks like the price has dropped another $25, making this a $75 savings in total. For a device that hasn't seen much in the way of price drops or It's no secret that Google has had some serious supply issues with its flagship Pixel phone. That goes for pretty much any combination of size, color, or storage. Rumors even began to surface alleging that Google had stopped production of the devices altogether. That wasn't the case, but nonetheless, you will still struggle to actually find the Pixel if you wish to buy it. A 32GB Pixel (international version) on eBay for $50 off the list price could be the answer to that problem. This is the entry level 5" Pixel, with 32GB of storage in the color Very Silver - and it's available for $599. That's $50 less than the $649 Google is still charging for it. Beware though, this is the international version of the device. So if you live in the US you'll have to check the bands to see if it works on your network. This version won't play nice with Verizon or Sprint, so if you're on either of those carriers you can rule this out. If you live outside the US then this is definitely for you. Shipping appears to be free in the US, but here in the UK, it's $18.99. That still works out a bargain for me, especially if you account for the exchange rate. You'll have to do the sums from where you are to see if the deal is as good for you. It's worth mentioning that getting your warranty honored might be tough with this type of purchase, so bear that in mind. It's hard to say how many of these they have, other than a "limited quantity," so you'll have to be quick if you want to get your hands on arguably the best Android phone of 2016. Update 1: 2017/05/26 2:32pm PDT It looks like the price has dropped another $25, making this a $75 savings in total. For a device that hasn't seen much in the way of price drops or sales since launch, $75 off isn't bad. Anyone interested in a Pixel that uses a network compatible with this international model should give it a serious think.

Then I'll get one. shamatuu that will never happen james fuston Looks like we found the one guy still using a Fire Phone. Middlefinger As a back up phone yeah, its not reliable enough to be a daily driver. Its problems seem to be a mixture of hardware bugs, and Googles poor software QC. me me "bargain" JL "buggy" Gladysrcrosby Managing director of Google!, is explaining to users to start off "Work at home" method, that People have been doing for about one year now. These days alone, I generated close to $36,000 until now with no more than my home computer as well as some spare time, despite that i have a fulltime 9 to 5 job. Even everyone not used to this, can make $89/per h easily and the earnings can go even higher over time... This is how i started !so184c: ➽➽ ➽➽;➽➽ http://GoogleFinancialCashJobs474MarketConsultantGetPaid$97/Hour... ★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫::::::!so184c:....,.... abc "bezel" Master Yates After handling a S8, OMG those Bezels. Max Johnson "blacklisted" Taylor Hardy I work from convenience of my residence, via hassle-free tasks which only needs only from you a Laptop in addition to on-line connection and I am just more successful than ever before... After six months with this work and therefore managed to get paid in total 36 thousand dollars... Mainly I make close to 80 bucks/h and work for 3 to 4 hours time daily.And fantastic point regarding this work is that you can easily arrange time period whenever you get the job done and for how long as you may wish for and you achieve a check each week.----->>>> learn by clicking here how to do it right now Middlefinger Even at $99 its not worth the bugs. It doesnt matter how 'high end' a device is, if it doesn't work properly, its worthless. jonzey231 $50 is worth a guarantee that Google will honor the warranty....trust me...I wish I would've gotten my 6P direct. Andy What do you mean? jonzey231 If you don't buy the phone from Google, they won't help you. They send you to the manufacturer. I was forced to go to Huawei for my 6P and it was a little over 3 weeks before I got it back....and the problem is still there. Spend the extra $50 and buy it through Google so you're guaranteed to get support through their CS channels. You'll be glad you did in 6 months when something inevitably goes wrong. IMHO get the OnePlus 3T. Costs less but has better overall specs aside from the camera which is still pretty good in its own right. My brother has one and my roommate just got his last week and they both have no intention of going back to a major brand ever again. YaKillaCJ Same happened when I got the OnePlus One. It changed the way I (and many others) view a "budget" device from an unknown brand. needa I felt the same way after using an OPO for nearly three years. Got me an XL in mint condition for $450. Google edition even. Still had 3520 mAh in the batt too. Would have bought the black 3T had they been in stock. Took me three days to hunt down this deal. Andy Got my wife the pixel. Runs great. Just had the microphone problem. Google swapped without question. Wife seems to think it takes horrible selfies. Rod Weird, as it's cameras are regarded among the best currently. Random! @andy maybe you should let her know that the camera isn't the problem... It's actually her face. If you do warn her about this, I promise to visit you at the hospital. Andy Thanks for the tip. VAVAMk_2 Huzzah! Master Yates Agreed with you regarding the 3T. Lets see if the excellent updates and support evaporate when the One Plus 5 is released? That's the real test. IcerC Except in this case Google is the Manufacturer, that might change things. VAVAMk_2 Google didn't make the camera. Uses a Sony made sensor but the camera software is Google's and regarded among the best in post processing, particularly HDR. Roy Ahh so nice call me when the 1+2 will get Nougat and your friend will get or never get Android O. ddevito #Fail Andy S8 release response? AdMoc Does not ship to Poland as fck always -_- Random! Look for some service like Shipito. I believe they have an EU warehouse. Shakil Shaikh $60 shipping? kristin ANY Pixel made by google is compatible with any provider. It doesnt matter if its international or not. This writer is an odiot. Scott Scrivens https://www.techwalls.com/google-pixel-pixel-xl-model-number-differences/ Kevin Davis "Odiot", lmao. 😂 Oh, and you're wrong, too. kristin I called google about this. It would be up your phone company provider whether it worked or not. So it may not work with att or tmobile either. kristin This may or may not work on any provider. Its up to the provider. You want a pixel? Go to swappa.com and get one used in mint condition for much cheaper. Ive gotten a few phones from them since ive been on project fi and had no issues. Ill never buy a new phone again. Random! $50 off? How cute... If they get to $300 off ($350 final price) within a month, I might even convince myself it's worth to stare at those bezels everyday. Other than that (impossible) scenario, I'd rather get the 3T, Axon 7, or even the LG G5. Gjorgi Lazarovski The Pixel is probably not dropping in price anytime soon. iKon The most overrated smartphone of 2016. Only the camera is decent. Ugly ass design, overpriced and dull with no features compared to competition Roy You mean the best smartphone of 2016, best camera rare band front, best software, best updates. Great battery, great display. xyz No, he means "The most overrated smartphone of 2016. Only the camera is decent. Ugly ass design, overpriced and dull with no features compared to competition." Roy No, I'm sure he/she means "the best smartphone of 2016, best camera rare band front, best software, best updates. Great battery, great display". iKon No I meant what I said. The pixel is a flop and even Google knows it. No matter how much money they put into advertising there are alot of better choices out there.. only hard core Google fanboys try and big it up Roy Yes yada yada and still every reviewer said is the best smartphone of 2016. So.. even David here. In the on of the day it's a lots about the UI and I just don't like Samsung software. Ordeith LOL. You're such a Google sycophant, Roy. Roy You feeling really smart? I'm Imagine your ass all over your face. nirmitlamed Google is so off track in figuring out what customers wants and competing against the other monstrous companies. I would very much like to hear how many Pixels Google sold in the last year since they told us they sold more than they expected. Lawrence I can put my coffee cup on the Bezel David Nowicki I'm a big Nexus fan, but why would you pay $749 for the Pixel XL vs the OnePlus 3T at about half the price ? And soon the OnePlus 5 at $450 or so with S8+ specs will be a steal compared to the Pixel 4Ui812 Supply and demand. Limit the supply and you increase demand. It's like P.T. Barnum said , "There's a sucker born every minute".

Google is working on a solution to the problem. By Martin Pratt 27 May 2017 Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share by email Google updates its Android smartphone operating system every year. Android O is on the horizon, but has your phone even updated to Android N? It takes too long to get updates to Android smartphones and finally Google has a plan to fix that. Google’s answer to the update roadblock is Project Treble, which completely retools the Android architecture making it easier for device manufacturers to update their phones. Just 7.1% of the two billion active Android devices are running Android N, while around 360 million devices are still using Android K, which released in 2013. Project Treble is unlikely to be of any use to anyone still using KitKat, but the changes to the underlying Android architecture could help future phones from HTC, Samsung and LG stay up to date. The chart below shows how the vast majority of Android phone users are on out of date versions. Best Buy smartphones – the best reviewed phones on the market. How does Project Treble work? To understand how Project Treble works it’s good to know why it needs to exist. Manufacturers such as Samsung, LG and HTC use Android in everything from their budget handsets to their flagship ranges. When Google announces a new version of Android the manufacturers begin the long process of adapting it to work with their phones. First off, they need to determine which phones can handle the new OS. The latest phones shouldn’t have any problems, but older, less powerful models may have difficulty running the new features. Our own testing has discovered phones that get worse after an OS update, so slapping a new version of Android onto a manufacturers entire range isn’t a good idea. The sheer amount of time it takes to adapt a new OS to a phone means adding it to older phones just isn’t worth the hassle. Phone manufacturers like to add their own special flavour to the stock Android OS. Samsung has TouchWiz, HTC has Sense, but whichever brand you go for there will be some kind of overlay. It takes time to get these extra features working with new versions of Android. Once the manufacturers have adapted their overlays to work with the new OS there is a period of testing to ensure that there are no problems. Providers like Vodafone and EE run their own tests too, which causes further delays. When the update is finally ready it will be released in selected countries. The staggered push of the update is a final test to see whether the new OS is working. By releasing it to countries with a smaller number of users, the manufacturers and networks can identify any last minute problems before they unleash it onto the millions of smartphones in the UK and America. Being a country of smartphone users we’re too risky for the first wave, but conversely we are a priority once the manufacturers are confident their phones behave themselves after the update. Project Treble aims to cut down how long it takes to roll out updates by separating the Android operating system from the ‘Vendor interface’. This interface handles the mundane, but important, low-level software and drivers. Previously it would be up to device manufacturers to adapt the vendor interface, a laborious process of code rewriting. Project Treble removes this lengthy process, which leaves the manufacturers free to work on the other aspects of the upgrade. We should get quicker updates and manufacturers may be keen on bringing the new software to older handsets in the future now the method is streamlined. When can we expect speedier updates? Here’s the catch to all this good news, only the Google Pixel is compatible with Project Treble, which means the Samsung Galaxy S8, LG G6 and HTC U11 will have the same update woes they’ve always had – bad news if you were looking to upgrade to a shiny new Android handset in 2017. Despite the current crop of state-of-the-art handsets not being compatible, Project Treble is still a step in the right direction to eradicating one of Android most significant issues.

ROS LBoard 1 Kit Siang: To be a top-class nation, follow your own religion FMT Reporters Read More FMT BAHASA FMT BORNEO+ FMT VIDEO CONTRIBUTE NEWS HOME NATION OPINION WORLD LEISURE SPORTS BUSINESS ADVERTISE WITH US Technology, the way forward for businesses Nora Jaswa | May 27, 2017 Google Malaysia advises companies to use technology to the fullest to carve out a niche for themselves in the industry. KUALA LUMPUR: Businesses, especially start-ups, should embrace technology in their everyday operations, says Google Malaysia. Communications head Zeffri Yusof said this would help them leverage on opportunities and assist in managing operations. “Technological software, for example, can help smoothen the gathering of data for a company, and this data can be analysed more accurately to give companies an edge in the market,” he said. Zeffri said a company could be a strong industry player when investments in technology were prioritised. “Take Google Maps, for example. We use layers of data using a global information system, or GIS, to create accurate coordinates and give more information about a place,” he said. He added that using data to create visualisations would give a company a wider overview of its operations and expedite decision-making. It will also eventually optimise a company’s operational cost, he said. Google Malaysia emerged first in a recent survey by JobStreet.com of the top 10 companies Malaysians aspire to work for. The survey involved 10,241 Malaysian employees across all position levels. According to the survey, Malaysians prioritise career development opportunities, citing this as the main reason they would want to work with top companies. Using its technology, Google gathers online data on its candidates to determine the best fit. “With the data, Google Malaysia has derived our own formula to find the best candidate and refine our search,” Zeffri said. The US-based tech giant is not the only company that uses technology as its main enabler. Recently, UEM Edgenta, a company providing asset management services to clients around the world, said it has plans for greater use of technology to streamline its three core offerings. Managing director and CEO Azmir Merican said UEM Edgenta would use technology enablers, develop smart solutions and make full use of the company’s centralised monitoring facility (CnC) to gain efficiency across its operations. “This is to reduce redundancies and operational expenditure and further showcase our business expertise in end-to-end services to our current and potential customers,” he said.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile Get Android O features on any Android phone right now with this free launcher Jacob Siegal @JacobSiegal May 26th, 2017 at 9:01 PM Share Tweet We’re likely still a few months out from the release of Android 8.0, but we got a glimpse at some of its most interesting new features and additions at Google I/O earlier this month. One of the features that Google showed off during the event was called Notification Dots, which are small dots that appear on apps when you have a notification. You won’t be able to try notification dots until Android O rolls out later this year, but you can add an unofficial version of the feature to your phone right now. Don't Miss: New report reaffirms the iPhone 8’s most exciting new feature This week, the first beta for Nova Launcher 5.2 arrived on Google Play. Along with some minor fixes and performances improvements, the latest update adds customizable notification dots to the launcher. You can decide where on the app icon they will appear and how large they will be. And just like the real dots, Nova Launcher’s notification dots will match the color scheme of the app icon they appear on. It’s not an exact replica of the notification dots that will appear on Android O, but if you want to take a trial run of the new feature, this might be the best way to do so, other than downloading the Android O beta. Unfortunately, the Android beta is only available on certain phones, while Nova is universal. If you want to try out the latest version of the Nova Launcher, just opt in on Google Play and wait for the update to arrive on your phone or manually download the 5.2 beta from APKMirror.

Tech Culture by Lynn La May 26, 2017 1:20 PM PDT @lynnlaaa Sergey Brin in 2015. James Martin/CNET Sergey Brin is aiming high. The Google co-founder and current president of Alphabet Inc., is allegedly building the world's biggest airship, according to The Guardian. The craft is supposedly being built in a giant NASA hangar and will measure nearly 650 feet long (or 200 meters). It's estimated to cost around $100 to $150 million dollars. "Sergey is pretty innovative and forward looking," said airship designer Igor Pasternak in an interview with the Guardian. "Trucks are only as good as your roads, trains can only go where you have rails, and planes need airports. Airships can deliver from point A to point Z without stopping anywhere in between." Pasternak worked on the project in its early stages. The airship will deliver food and supplies to remote areas that need humanitarian aid, while at the same time provide luxury air travel to Brin's family and close friends.

Security by Alfred Ng May 26, 2017 2:35 PM PDT @alfredwkng Enlarge Image Thirty-one tech companies are pushing Congress to change the NSA's mass surveillance. PAUL J. RICHARDS/AFP/Getty Images Silicon Valley's giants are tired of US spies standing on their shoulders to see further. In a letter dated Friday and signed by 31 tech companies, including Google, Amazon, Facebook and Microsoft, the firms are asking Congress to make reforms to Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. That's the section that allows the National Security Agency to gather web data of citizens outside of the US -- and in some cases, against Americans. Section 702 was first revealed by whistleblower Edward Snowden in bombshell leaks surrounding the NSA's mass surveillance program. The snooping combed through everything a person did digitally, putting tech companies at odds with the government for years. The section is set to expire by December 31 unless Congress decides to renew the program. Silicon Valley leaders hope the politicians on Capitol Hill choose to change Section 702, instead of renewing it. In the letter (PDF), they offered five recommendations for internet surveillance reform, including greater transparency on how many Americans are swept up in the snooping, narrowing the scope to prevent innocent people from being spied on, and greater oversight on the program. "We are writing to express our support for reforms to Section 702 that would maintain its utility to the U.S intelligence community while increasing the program's privacy protections and transparency," the group wrote. Since 2013, Google has wanted to disclose what data they're legally required to hand over to the government, which the feds prohibit. Apple has faced battles of its own, with the San Bernardino terrorist's locked iPhone and the FBI's order to crack it open. In just the second half of 2016, national security orders for Apple doubled to 6,000 requests since the first half of the year. Apple was not among the 31 tech companies who wrote to House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, a Virginia Republican, on Friday, even while the debate on privacy vs. national security rages on. Apple did not respond to requests for comment on Friday. In March, the Internet Infrastructure Coalition wrote a letter to the Judiciary Committee warning that Section 702 could have "grave economic consequences" if it were not reformed. It's still unclear how many Americans were swept up by the wide-reaching surveillance, but Section 702 is estimated to be behind a quarter of the NSA's snooping in 2014.

Claims that ABC News siphons readers away from Fairfax publications are unfounded. AAP Image/Joel Carrett Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger Fairfax CEO Greg Hywood has been busy. His company’s announcement on 3 May 2017 that Fairfax would sack 125 of its newsroom staff led to Sydney Morning Herald and The Age journalists going on strike, at the worst possible time in the Australian political calendar. Meanwhile, media reports highlighted Hywood’s annual pay of over A$7 million – which at a median reported salary for journalists of just over A$51,000 would comfortably pay for the most of the staff laid off in Hywood’s announcement. This is not to say that Hywood does not deserve a CEO-level salary, of course. But in light of the criticism of the job losses at Fairfax, his defence of executive pay levels was tin-eared, to say the least: We pride ourselves on providing above-market salaries… We need good people to work at this business. You don’t fix the issues confronting the media business by doing the same thing again and again, and expecting a different result. Yet here we are again, with more journalists sacked, and no clear indication of how this is going to make Fairfax’s news outlets more attractive. Faced with such questioning from the Senate inquiry into public interest journalism, Hywood resorted to a familiar trope for commercial media executives – blame market distortion by the public broadcaster: The ABC is creating additional pressure on commercial media by aggressively competing for the same audience that commercial media rely on by providing online content for free, undermining our ability to create a sustainable model. However, this seems to be fundamentally ignorant of the fact that for years now, the ABC has done what few commercial news outlets have been prepared to do: promote the news stories published by its competitors. Promoting the work of others The ABC has long partnered with Microsoft’s Bing search engine to include a block of links to related content from elsewhere on the web alongside its own stories. This recognises audiences’ interest in seeing multiple independent angles on the same story. Sadly, commercial outlets like the Sydney Morning Herald (SMH) still lack this basic feature and link only to (often virtually identical) stories on their sister sites, such as The Age. Related links in a recent ABC News article - including to Fairfax property Australian Financial Review. Screenshot by Axel Bruns Rather than siphoning eyeballs from its commercial competitors, could ABC News be a driver of traffic to them, then? Traffic data from Hitwise, which tracks Australian users’ web browsing patterns, can provide an answer to this question. First, let us put these sites in perspective. In order to compare like with like, we’ll use the numbers for ABC News here, rather than visits to the main ABC site with its multitude of non-news content. Hitwise data report that the SMH consistently attracts a much larger volume of visits than ABC News. In March 2017, for instance, its 38.2 million total visits constitute about a quarter more than ABC News’ 29.9 million. The Age receives around 27.5 million total visits over the same period. Neither can compete with undisputed market leader news.com.au, with 72.8 million total visits that month. Put together, visits to these two Fairfax properties are already more than twice as large as those to ABC News, then – if the ABC is undermining Fairfax’s market position, it’s not making a very good job of it. Traffic patterns But this is not a zero-sum game, of course. Visitors to ABC News, aided by its helpful links to external content, may well find themselves heading to the Fairfax outlets for more information. Even in the absence of outbound links from Fairfax, the same might be true in reverse, too. Here, the upstream websites recorded by Hitwise – that is, the sites visited just before coming to the SMH or ABC News – tell an interesting story. The SMH receives the vast plurality of its inbound reader traffic from Google sites: some 38.9% of its traffic enter via Google Australia, Google (international), Google News Australia, or Gmail. Another 7.8% arrive via Facebook or Twitter. Similar patterns hold for other sites: in March, The Age receives 28.2% of its traffic from Google sites, and 9.2% from Facebook or Twitter. For ABC News, those percentages are 26.9% and 7.9%, respectively. news.com.au gets 32.2% of its traffic from Google sites, and 7.9% from social media. ABC News’ outbound links are necessarily a much smaller factor than the connections provided by these internet giants, but should not be ignored. In March, 2.1% of the SMH’s traffic began with readers coming in from ABC sites. For The Age, the percentage is even greater: 2.9% of its traffic originated from ABC sites. But the ABC does not play favourites amongst the commercial sites: 2.2% of news.com.au traffic arrived from here. Such public service is hardly reciprocated, however: only 0.9% of ABC News’ already lower volume of traffic originated from the two Fairfax sites. Empty corporate rhetoric There are deeper traffic patterns that the Hitwise data cannot reveal. What we see here are only the sites visited immediately before – not pages opened independently in another user session, or arrived at through a more circuitous route. And yes, as quality news publications ABC News and the two Fairfax sites do operate in the same market segment, of course. But Hywood’s, and other media executives’, statements continue to assume that online audiences make a conscious binary choice between one outlet and another, and that public service media therefore distort the market. This fails to understand how serendipitous our news discovery has become in an age of search and social recommendations. It also fails to recognise that serious news followers – the core audience for these sites – will often read multiple stories on the same events, from multiple outlets. Not least perhaps because they know that understaffed newsrooms now regularly struggle to cover major issues in sufficient detail. The traffic patterns we have seen here, at any rate, reveal that audiences lost to ABC News should be the least of Greg Hywood’s worries. The major Fairfax sites consistently outperform the ABC in terms of reader traffic, and the public broadcaster is even a net source of visits to the SMH and The Age. Similarly, when Hywood calls for “a level playing field which allows local media to take the necessary steps to compete with Google and Facebook”, he fails to recognise that these platforms are the single greatest source of traffic to Fairfax’s sites. Fairfax, and other news sites, are not competing with Google and Facebook: for better or worse, they fundamentally rely on them for visibility and visitors. Media businesses that cannot adjust to this fact are doomed to struggle. Data on Australian Internet users’ news browsing patterns are provided courtesy of Hitwise.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « The Case about the Downing of an Air Egypt Flight related to Apple Devices is still ongoing with Apple not Involved | Main | Apple Opened their First Singapore Store Today with 237 Staff and Angela Ahrendts Greeting Happy Customers » May 26, 2017 Apple's advances in AI Continue to Surface at a Record Pace as news of a 'Neural Engine' Chip now Emerges   Even though Apple was the first major tech company to adopt a digital assistant for use in their smartphone natively, progress on this front seemed to be at a snails pace. Then out of nowhere Amazon shocked the market with a smarter digital assistant on a home device called Echo. Google Home rapidly followed and their latest upgrade will offer free phone calls within the U.S. and Canada and deeper connectivity to Android. Now Microsoft, Harman Kardon and many tech companies are jumping on the bandwagon with new smart home digital assistant based devices aimed to land on the market this fall.   Even Samsung has technically jumped into the market with Bixby in the last month on their Galaxy S8 that they promise will be integrated into future devices and appliances as part of their IoT roadmap. In fact a new design patent that surfaced on May 16 shows us that they have an advanced Echo-like device with a full flexible display on the drawing board that could run Android as their patent figures suggest below.   We noted in a report back on May 11 that the AI Wars were almost reaching Fever Pitch levels. Almost ever week if not every day there's an AI story surfacing. On May 14 Apple aquired their third major AI company in three years. On the same day we posted a patent report titled "Apple has designed a new Siri Architecture allowing Two Digital Assistants to Communicate with Each Other." Last month we posted a patent report tiled "Apple Patent Reveals a Visual System to Assist Siri in Future Devices to understand Gestures, Activities, & More"   At the top of this month we posted a report titled "Inventec Lands First Order for Apple's Echo-Like Home Device with Siri." Although it's a supply chain rumor, Apple fans hope that this could be a big moment at Apple's WWDC in June. Some believe it will launch this fall. Yet what matters is that Apple brings a new Siri based device into the home to support their Smart Home project and to keep the competition at bay.   Google is crafting the argument that they are the one's to beat in AI without question. Patently Apple covered Google's vision in two reports titled "The Vision of Artificial Intelligence According to the Gospel of Google" and "The Google Manifesto: The Arrival of the AI Revolution."   Apple supplier TSMC sees some of the sand beginning to shift into new directions. Co-CEO Mark Liu.Mobile let if be known last month that while smartphones will still drive the market for them in the short term, that new and innovative features for smartphones and other mobile devices including virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), context-aware computation, and artificial intelligence (AI) and deep machine learning require support of more powerful computing technology." Translation: new chips are on their roadmap to power new technologies and features like VR/AR and AI.   The hint of new advanced chips coming to market gave way this afternoon to a new report by Bloomberg claiming that "Apple is working on a processor devoted specifically to AI-related tasks, according to a person familiar with the matter. The chip, known internally as the Apple Neural Engine, would improve the way the company's devices handle tasks that would otherwise require human intelligence -- such as facial recognition and speech recognition." So now the chip will have a name.   The timing of this latest leak about the Apple Neural Engine may have been timed perfectly to start cranking up their developers and fans for the WWDC keynote on June fifth.   The news of advances to Siri in the works have been mounting so fiercely in the last few months that it's now time for Team Apple to knock one out of the park and set their developers on fire for the next phase of Apple AI.   On the flip-side, it's always best to not get over-hyped about anything Apple until it actually unfolds. We know positive things are in the works and they'll roll out whenever Apple is ready to unleash them. But I have to admit, I'm definitely pumped-up for next month's event – are you?   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

Google is now offering four free months of Google Play Music for new subscribers Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/26 2:17pm PDTMay 26, 2017 70 Plus 1 on G+ 511 Share on Facebook 83 Share on Twitter Total Shares664 Google News Right now it looks like Google is running a special offer for Google Play Music. New subscribers that sign up here can get four free months of service instead of the usual three. No telling how long this offer might last, so if you have been considering subscribing, now might be the time to do it. It could save you an extra $10. Again, this particular offer is only for new subscribers. I've been a fan of Play Music for a long time, though the device removal limit does get in the way when you switch between devices and ROMs as often as I do. Being able to mix your own library with those of a service also comes in handy. That way I can continue to support artists I am passionate about, without eschewing the larger selection of a subscription offering for the purposes of content discovery, all while being able to fill the gaps in that library. There are a lot of different music services out there, but if you're interested combining your curated library with music available via a subscription, then your options are limited. Spotify does allow you to play back locally stored files, which is convenient, but it isn't quite the same. Amazon also allows you to upload your music for playback via Amazon Music, and with Amazon Prime membership, you get a small library of streaming music to go along with that. For $10 a month ($8 for Prime members) you can access their full library as well. But, Google Play Music has a great interface and plugs nicely into all the other Google services we love. Maybe with this new offer, it's time you gave Google Play Music a chance? After all, even if it doesn't end up working out, you still got four free months of music out of the deal.

I have a secondary account based in England as part of a mail forwarder service I use, and my bf is Greek so I had him check the code on his account :) Carson Saldanha Oh wow! Carson Saldanha Hey, since I know it worked for you, are you able to use YouTube Red along with this Play Music free trial? Because my YT Red doesn't seem to be enabled for me. Ailín Ó’S No, unfortunately not as I live in the EU and YouTube Red is only available in USA. Carson Saldanha Weird, I'm in the US though. Ailín Ó’S Ooh that is odd. Sign out of the app then sign back in maybe? Carson Saldanha No luck :( I'm in contact with Google support atm Hopefully they can sort this out Mike Worth it alone for Youtube Red MisterAlex Sweet, I wasn't sure if that was included. Thanks. Should mention that in the main blog post. Ben Still no student membership >:( Ailín Ó’S Spotify is a great alternative @€$£5/month. Ben I know that's what I use just because it's half the price. Ailín Ó’S In Ireland Vodafone have a partnership with Spotify whereby it costs €5 standard instead of €10 regardless of if you're a student or not, they even bundle it with some of their plans. Vodafone do the same in some other countries they operate in (not all). Maybe see if any network in your country has a partnership like that? Worth a shot! Ben Oh yeah I'm on EE in the UK and I've got Apple Music for free for 6 months but like iTunes is a massive stinking turd. Ailín Ó’S I'd rather go back to the days of getting music via Bluetooth from friends than use crApple Music 😂😂 Rahul Krishna In india, we have play music for 1.4 usd/month Umang Ladia I'm only seeing 2 months offer in India.?? Rahul Krishna Well I subscribed to it when it launched here (about 2 months ago), so I can't confirm that. But at this price, there is nothing to be disappointed about. aRvInD I wish Spotify launches soon here. I can't keep using that patched version here...!! Rahul Krishna Me too xyz As it should be, you can't charge European or American prices in India. Rahul Krishna Yes true. There are lots​ of people here with a very cheap Android phone. They cannot pay much money. Julian Coronado That's actually what's keeping me away from Play Music. I've used my free months and I loved the Youtube Red too. But as a student, Spotify for $5 / month is too great to pass up on. Emiliejmosley Google is paying 97$ per hour! Work for few hours & have longer with friends and family! !sm141c: On tuesday I got a great new Land Rover Range Rover from having earned $8752 this last four weeks..

Cakefish Spotify ftw ToniCipriani ✓pǝᴉɟᴉɹǝʌ I don't think this is a new offer, got this a while back. In fact my 4 months is expiring next week. Prefer Spotify over it. Song selection a tad bit weaker, and for foreign songs it tries to translate the song names to English and makes it hard to look up. folkrav I like it, it's way cheaper than Spotify for me - my mother, my sister, my wife and myself each pay 30$ a year and we're set - but Jesus do I hate the clients. I don't like the website's interface, I hate the Android app. But yeah, I'll deal with it cause it's cheap, I guess. Carson Saldanha Got it! Yay! Jim I wish I could somehow get it on my Amazon Echo hahaha. I guess if I had paid for a Google Home it would be worth trying out. Forget vega #getEVGA Why google play music isn't available in my country ? Ailín Ó’S Try Apple Music? They seem to be just about everywhere. Iamsecond And this is why Apple continue to dominate, because Apple are truly interested in being an international company whereas Google is just playing at it. Such a shame xyz Because Google sucks. Bartek Juszczak My GPM radio's are so good these days I love that Google is so into AI. Whether It's just "I'm being lucky" or radio from a specific song, band or album they very rarely disappoint me these days. I just make sure to thumbs up if it plays a song I particularly love. I am a student and could go cheaper with spotify but the AI generated playlists have me locked in. If it's £5 cheaper but I'm not gonna enjoy it nearly as much then it's not really a good deal. AndTheWorldMayNeverKnow I used the 3 or 4 months free trial during the holidays then bought the family plan for $14.99 a month. 4 people in my family us it and it works great, the app could use some tweaks but it's really good overall. paev If you listen to main stream music it doesn't really matter what service to use. However, if you like something unusual, weird or other languages then Google is a way to go. I found bands on Google music that Spotify displayed as not found. Google also have new synth bands that Spotify doesn't. I'm for Google too. Daniel I discovered that GPM is kinda like a music label. I once went to a section of Google play explaining how indie artists can use GPM like a music label as long as they own all their rights. Ryne Hager Ultraista (among others) keeps me using Google Play Music as well as Spotify. Carson Saldanha Does anyone else who activated the Play Music trial have YouTube Red working as well? My YT Red doesn't seem to be enabled while my Play Music is. Michael Carr I spotted a similar offer a couple of months ago, and I took it after a day or two's thought. Just last week, I moved directly into a family plan. PewPewYoureDead It's hard to recommend Google Play Music until they revamp the UI. Margaritas Ante Porcos Google Music is the only choice in some markets, like Russia, where no Spotify or Pandora are available. There are too many shortcomings in Google Music and Google never shows interest in making services better than below average. I really wonder why Google refuses to become the best at anything. Real magic here. Pixel syndrome all the way. Yet Google Music is on my phone and I use it because there's no choice whatsoever. Rob You answered your own question. If there's no alternative, then they don't have any incentive to improve the service. SupahNin10doh Stupid Dorito logo... Raymond Berger Huh, I just subscribed to the trial but you youtube red hasn't kicked in yet. Any idea how long it takes? Iamsecond If you live in the UK, about 2 years so far h20ray Google Play Music is currently available in select territories and for select account types. Umang Ladia I'm only seeing 2 months offer in India, anybody can confirm? Mohammad Ovais Yeah, same for me. Maybe it's region limited. Isolde I think you need to open the link in a browser, if you open it in the app it's just the normal 2 months. Manoj | Blogging Triggers Is Google Music really worth to it? We have better alternatives Sathiya Moorthy Karan I came across a great post, it seems to be so cool http://developeit.net/android-news-image-scanner-finder/ Zachariah Mann It only shows up as 2 free months for me. I live in Michigan. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/a19b7e9dddb67bf897c751aedf63c01917048214140db901fd783b2182d8d5c0.png Mikael Jakobsson Should mabye joine premium at Google Music if that coste like $2 max a month dont understand why they should take as mutch as someone some has app or Win32 software to PC so music controllers one they keyboards works. Tab out frome a game for pause music when the round is over is just bad. Arif Gürü And stil isnt available on Turkey xyz "No telling how long this offer might last, so if you have been considering subscribing, now might be the time to do it." No thanks, I'll just use YouTube. Only thing YT needs is an option to play audio only so I can save a wee bit more data when I don't need video.

Reuters/Eric Gaillard Google announced a new system that can track credit card purchases made offline. The tech giant can already track online shopping and declared it will launch a tool designed to track how much money people spend in merchants’ brick-and-mortar stores. The combined ad clicks of individuals who are logged into Google services will be matched to perform the analysis. Ponemon Institute privacy research firm chairman Larry Ponemon said aggregated data can be translated to data that can identify users. Google’s senior vice president of ads and commerce Sridhar Ramaswamy assured that “incredibly smart people” were consulted in creating the system, which he described it as “secure and privacy safe.” The internet company said it has access to at around 70 percent of US credit and debit card sales via its partnerships with some companies that monitor data. It is unclear how much access Google has to Australians’ credit card details. It clarified it would not be able to examine the specific items that people are purchasing or how much a specific individual spends. But what Google can do is it can alert merchants automatically when their digital ads convert into sales at a brick-and-mortar store. Previously, an advertiser may conclude that the ad is a waste of money when people clicked on it, but does not buy anything online. Therefore, the program can possibly influence merchants to further their digital marketing budgets. Ponemon recognised that Google has good intentions but pointed companies and governments in the future might not. Miro Copic, a marketing professor at San Diego State University, also expressed concern of the new tracking device’s safety, saying the kinds of data that Google collects might be targeted by hackers. “The privacy implications of this are pretty massive, so Google needs to tread very carefully,” news.com.au quoted Copic  as saying.  Meanwhile, Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, told The Washington Post that what he found fascinating was that while companies become ever more intrusive as far as data collection is concerned, they also become more “secretive.” Google already has the ability to determine what their users like through the searches they make as well as the videos they watch. Online advertisements are targeted to those interests. The new program carries tracking into offline stores, with the company explaining that its computers largely depend on login information like email addresses in order to spot people clicking on ads.

Resold Pixel phones originally purchased from Project Fi are having their IMEIs blacklisted Richard Gao Follow View All Posts 2017/05/25 5:30am PDTMay 25, 2017 59 Plus 1 on G+ 141 Share on Facebook 58 Share on Twitter Total Shares258 Google News Pixel Pixel XL Project Fi Back in November, when the Pixel was slowly beginning to ship to customers, there were numerous reports of people getting their Google accounts banned for purchasing Pixel and Pixel XL devices with the intent to resell them. It turns out that this issue hasn't exactly been laid to rest, as it seems that Pixel phones purchased from Project Fi for this purpose are now getting blacklisted via their IMEI numbers. As an overview, people originally bought Pixels from both the Google Store and Project Fi to sell them to a New Hampshire-based reseller. Why New Hampshire, you may ask? There's no sales tax. Both parties here were supposed to make a profit, but Google ended up banning a ton of accounts for a violation of their terms of service.. Considering how important Google is in our lives (Gmail, Google Photos, YouTube, Play Store, etc.), a lot of people were obviously not happy. In the end, Google did restore many of these accounts, but it was obviously enough for a good scare. However, it seems that Google still hasn't completely forgiven people for violating their ToS. Kyle Bennett, the editor-in-chief and founder of the HardOCP website, had his Pixel XL's IMEI blacklisted just yesterday. IMEIs are typically blacklisted by carriers when phones are lost or stolen, but that's clearly not what happened here. Calling T-Mobile didn't do anything, as their staff told him that they could not reverse the blacklisting. His communication with Swappa support was more interesting, though; here's what they told him: "Sorry to hear of the complaints. We have seen a great number of Pixel devices becoming blacklisted the past two days. We are still trying to figure out why this has happened to so many devices. We are working to find out the cause of this widespread issue. It would be best for both of you to keep on top of Google and pressing them for an explanation. In one other case, I saw this morning Google agreed to send the buyer a replacement device so that might be an option to look into. Seller please work with the buyer and Google to see if they can get to the bottom of it." Kyle then contacted Google support, with the first representative claiming that he had simply received a spam message. When he showed a second rep how his IMEI had indeed been blacklisted via Swappa's ESN/IMEI checker (useful tool if you're buying a phone, by the way), he was told that his Pixel XL hadn't been reported as stolen, but that it had been originally purchased through Project Fi. Kyle was also once again told that his phone hadn't really been blacklisted, but a quick rescan of his IMEI in Swappa proved otherwise. His case was escalated to Project Fi's support team, but the customer service rep refused to give him a reference number and told him that he'd receive it via email. After contacting a third representative, Kyle was informed that his phone had indeed been blacklisted, but that Google wasn't responsible for doing so. This lends further credence to the Project Fi explanation, as it's the carrier and not the manufacturer that has the ability to blacklist devices. The situation is still ongoing, but that's all we know for now; we'll update with more information as we get it.

Okay. NeverrKnowsBest You can sell a Project Fi phone. You just buy them in bulk and try to make a profit off Project Fi. Stupid that the customer is being punished for this, though. Green Dog Is it clear that this is one of the phones that was bought in bulk from that retailer? From my reading, it was just a resold phone. I mean obviously, it's not happening to all phones, but the fact that it's still happening is a concern. NeverrKnowsBest The IMEIs are being linked to one particular reseller in New Hampshire. celestre Do you have more information than is present in the article on this? NeverrKnowsBest I'm just going off what the article said. I would love to read more, but I highly doubt they are just flipping the switch on every resold Project Fi phone. That just isn't very plausible, at least to my knowledge. datkidpatrick you misunderstood the article... they referenced a time where a bulk reseller's phones were black listed... but now it is happening to a bunch of random sellers that decided to sell the phone... Richard Gao The bulk reseller's phones weren't blacklisted at that time. It is entirely possible that these are the same phones. datkidpatrick i purchased mine straight from project fi... sold it 3 months ago and the seller told me the other day it was blacklisted... and yes my mistake.. the bulk resellers email's were blocked or something like that... Cael Did you pay off the phone before you sold it? datkidpatrick yes i did... Corey Kinard So they're punishing someone that fully paid for a device from you, who fully owned the device? They're legally allowed to just fully break something they've already sold and have no right to? This is worse than when carriers wouldn't unlock phones... datkidpatrick im still giving google the benefit of doubt that it was a mistake... they just need to fix it PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ You'll easily win in small claims court if you have to refund and take the phone back. PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ What kind of financing plan did you have? They were first sold in Oct. 22 2016 and this is only May 2017. I seem to remember 24 month financing or 12 month financing. You paid your phone off three months ago and already had sold it on Swappa for some time? datkidpatrick ya youre allowed to pay it off early... PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ Maybe that's what caused the error at Fi in blacklisting by accident. datkidpatrick ya that doesn't make any sense... but it got fixed this morning by google... NeverrKnowsBest I see that now. Thanks for the clarification. In any case, there has to be something in common with these blacklisted phones, I don't think Google/Project Fi would blacklist all second hand phones, I don't think that's very plausible. Corey Kinard Do you really need to think straight when you are in competition for largest company in the world? They probably got algorithms looking for shit and those algorithms mess up. 4Ui812 That's pretty shitty Google. David Bowline Is it really? What's shitty is the people buying in bulk just to make an easy buck and therefore screwing people over. Swappa needs to go after these people. jonzey231 Yeah but if I bought a Pixel LAST YEAR and wanted to sell it no in preparation for the next Pixel or the OP5, for example, my customer may get screwed even though it was just an innocent buy and resell. Max Uh? That's not what happened here... so far this situation seems to be the result of a reseller elaborate plan to evade tax and sell the scarce phone for a bigger profit. This wasn't an individual reselling his/her own phone. jonzey231 Uh? I know that it was originally caused by the douche bags in NJ, but now it's affecting regular people. 4Ui812 That's called capitalism. No one is forcing you to buy it. What Google needs to do is fix all the reported issues with that shitty phone. As for the limited supply of said phone , again that's Google's fault (hell , I wouldn't be surprised if Google intentionally limted the supply ... That's a play out of nintys handbook) Duder12 I have a pixel. There is nothing wrong with my phone. I love it. SirCanealot But I have a Pixel and it is broken. Surely this is not possible to exist in reality? :O :O :O A Person It may suck, but who is to decide how my money is spent? kbbl Caveat emptor. SeanPR11 Or.... don't buy your phone from a New Jersey Douchebag. If people don't buy from them, they will stop doing this bullshit. It sucks that regular people are caught in the middle (which happens all too often). It seems Swappa should have known these phones were out there (given the business they are in) and flagged them with the IMEI checker. Alex Excuse them for doing whatever they like with a product they purchased. Pfff SeanPR11 Amen. Ryan from GroupTweet Yes, its shitty. If anything Google should go after the reseller, not the innocent legitimate customers that bought the devices and who are now punished because their phones are blacklisted. Alexander Z Great Swappa can't GO after anyone. Maybe suspend/revoke their account but that's it. My trusted seller hasn't been any help at all with the blacklisted pixel I bought. It's so messed up!! T4rd Saw the site/forum owner of a site I frequent get hit with this on his Pixel this week too. Crazy how the Pixel is being plagued with all sorts of extraneous issues. They can't stay in stock, forcing people to buy second hand, then they get black listed because of some weird policy Google has with Project Fi phones. Max Well being out of stock has nothing strange coming from a Google phone, that's been their main issue for a few years now (Nexus), and it happens even to Apple on launch but the difference is that they're a lot better ramping up production afterwards. This blacklisting is really weird, but so far it seems to be potentially related to a shady reseller so we'll have to wait and see if we get more clarification soon. Geoff Johnson As someone from New Hampshire, it's weird to see my state in an AP article, since nothing interesting ever happens here lol. This sucks though because buyers who bought their Pixel 2nd hand months ago now suddenly might get it blacklisted? J.J. Holy f. That is terrible. So random guy buys a second hand pixel (because Google was out of stock) later gets blacklisted by Google/fi. Gets no help from Google. Never buys a Google phone again. Real smart. Green Dog This on top of the seeming shaky quality of the phones may force me to an iPhone. J.J. I feel ya there but, i just can't do the iPhone thing. Loving this s8+ right now. Duder12 When consumers say this its just sad. Why when you have a difficult time with one android manufacturer immediately think its all Androids and switch to the iPhone? This is how Apple gets tons of customers. Everyone that had a bad time with Samsung just assumed their only other option was iPhone bc MARKETING. Green Dog Because I don't want to have to deal with OS updates through the carrier or a limited phone in terms of LTE bands, as is common for Android phones? People like other phones and I've played with some of them, but I like the Pixel/Nexus lines. But this does give me pause. blenderboy Well, the only offering that competes with iPhone in the world of android is the pixel phone. Samsung displays(hardware in general) are great but software experience can't be compared with iPhone or pixel. It is just sad that they can't keep up with Apple or Google. Google is trying really hard to reach there. I am still using Android because of the platforms openness. Duder12 Fair enough but you know what I mean. You are an exception but A LOT of consumers act this way. Honestly I bought my Pixel through the Google Store last fall and its been solid. I love it. Google needs to sort out the second hand market but these are growing pains. Hardware is still new to them bc the nexus line had help from the OEMs. Now they dont. marcusmarcus2 His comment does not address all Androids. He is only speaking of this one phone. It could be he was between using phones by Google and iPhones and he choose to go with Google's phone. Now with this situation, he decided to go to his second choice. I'm not defending switching to an iPhone over another manufacturer, just pointing out his statement you criticized did not say what you thought it was saying and you were the one to actually apply his statement to all Androids. Just playing the devil's advocate here Alex Because when you pay 7-8-900€ (the price of an iPhone) on an Android phone you expect it to be flawless. And that's normal! However, in real life, regardless if you pay 300 or 800€, Android remains Android, with its notoriously inconsistent battery life, inexplicable wakelocks, unfixed bugs (don't get me stored on the "low priority" bugs with thousands of stars), 2 year updates, etc, etc. tekfr33kn That seems a little dramatic considering that iPhones are far from flawless. You also pay that amount for your average laptop and they aren't flawless. It seems you, or someone else, is holding Android phones to an unrealistic standard. Alex Please don't compare a laptop with an Android phone. It makes absolutely no sense. Isn't it rather that manufacturers (Google being the first of them) increase the prices each year to hallucinating levels with little to no innovation or improvement in user experience. Take the S8 line. Beautiful phones, remarkable design, but a fraction of the cost you pay goes to that crap Bixby that nobody wants tekfr33kn I'll agree with you that Google is artificially raising the price far beyond what it should be but that's basic capitalism and market forces. If the market doesn't want those kinds of prices or can't support it, it won't sell. The issue is that people are actually willing to pay that. iPhones are the primary example. There's about $400 - $500 worth of stuff put in a phone that goes for $800 - $1000 and they still sell like hotcakes. I also agree with you about the S8's and Bixby but again, the market says that the S8 is a hot seller and so Samsung isn't about to change that trend. That kind of makes your argument moot. As for comparing a smartphone to a laptop - if you can't see the comparisons, it's either willful ignorance or you just don't know a thing about electronic devices (specifically smartphones or laptops). In either case, I can't help you with that. The fact is that they share more in common that differences. It's one of the many reasons that development strategies (hardware and software) often translate quite well between them. xyz Uhm, because the phone in question is the overpriced Google phone that is intended to compete with the iPhone and which Google fanboys insist is the greatest Android phone of all time. psychic99 It costs about the same to make a Pixel XL as it does an iphone 7, so why would you expect Google to make less margin than Apple? I will say their ecosystem and support SUCKs compared to Apple, so yeah it should be hundred less because the lifecycle experience of a Pixel will be much worse than Apple and the fact that they artificially end support after 2 years is atrocious. I have 4+ year old Nexus that operate just fine on custom ROMs. And BTW I don't think it is worth it either and happily keep my Nexus 6p for less than 50% the cost. I can't rationalize the price they are asking. Google's support is not consistent. Either they will go over the top to help, or tell you go away you are screwed, There is nothing in the middle, and until you engage them you have no idea if you are going to get help or the hand. Yet another reason they should be hundreds less. Merrill Sampson Just FYI, Google announced at IO a few days ago that they're extending the support cycle on the Pixel from 2 year to 5. marcusmarcus2 Do you have a source for that? https://support.google.com/nexus/answer/4457705?hl=en#nexus_devices Android Version updates: October 2018 Security updates: October 2019 Duder12 Dont forget that apple blocked iPhones that had their fingerprint sensor replaced. Also, dont forget Apple is trying to get a bill banned that will allow consumers to have 3rd parties fix phones. PS: My Pixel is fucking awesome. NexusKoolaid "Dont forget that apple blocked iPhones that had their fingerprint sensor replaced." And this in and of itself was a good thing. With the sensor and the CPU being paired, the sudden appearance of a new sensor having a new signature was deemed to be a security breach. I'm not standing up for Apple here, just calling a spade a spade. And I don't know what information Apple could have shared with 3rd party repair houses (if they were inclined to play nice with them) without compromising security. "PS: My Pixel is fucking awesome." I wish I had one. But they were so hard to get hold of for so long that at this point I'll hang on to my 6P until the Pixel2 is out. psychic99 On Android if you reinstall the O/S or make major modifications they simply invalidate the fingerprint then you have to enter the password manually as a failback. Then you can enrol your fingerprint again. In fact every few days you have to manually enter your pin on N to get into the phone. Sounds like a reasonable method, rather than locking the phone forever. Apple went one step farther. You should go watch youtube... Apple is on a mission to make 3rd party repair a thing of the past. They even specifically make it hard to repair. They want control of the supply chain and dispose of equipment as fast as possible. NexusKoolaid On your first point, there is little control over hardware used to support the platform, so core design decisions are prone to fall back to a software solution. Apple on the other hand has tight control of their hardware and have the option for hardware based solutions, whatever the motivation might be, such as better security or to maintain control of their platform (probably a mix on the two). On your second point, I've read the headlines and seen videos on Youtube (like Louis Rossman). Yeah - their crusade against 3rd party repair sickens me to no small degree. Not just because it would prevent me from seeking out more economical and timely repair of my phone (if I had an iPhone), but because this type of precedent could trickle down to other things I might want to tinker with. Jay Hate to say it but that is the risk people run when you don't buy your devices brand new. J.J. True. But they exasperate said risk artificially for the perceived end goal.... More Profit. The truth is they are doing the exact opposite. This news definitely makes me pause on buying a pixel at all. The Second hand market is real and if i have a bad experience do to Google on a second hand device i will probably not buy new from them when i have the funds. james fuston If you (or the person who sells you a phone) violates the terms of service, you're gonna have a bad time regardless of manufacturer. blenderboy Real question to ask, did Apple ever had similar issue with many devices? hunter2 Probably not since Apple realizes that the perceived strong resale value is a determining factor for many people. Even people who may have never sold a product second hand gain some comfort from the knowledge that they could potentially recoup a lot of their costs if they ever needed to sell. ericshmerick Do the TOS say you can never ever resell the device? Serious question. ekana_stone No the TOS is that you resell as soon as you bought it, so like if you bought from fi cuz it's cheaper and the resold it a little under asking. It's only those phones that were black listed ericshmerick What defines "as soon as?" 5 minutes after purchase? 1 week? 2.8 months? 3 years? marcusmarcus2 Do we have confirmation that it is only those phones that were black listed? Could they have inadvertently black listed other phones from fi? EarlyMon The TOS say that commercial resale is not allowed and lots of them were resold by a private company in a scheme that tried to avoid sales tax. Santos Chavez It actually does say that isn't allowed, hence why they initially banned several accounts the first time. It was a breach of their TOS, and it still is. It's likely Project Fi saw these phones as stolen and blacklisted them. james fuston "You may only purchase Devices for your personal use. You may not commercially resell any Device, but you may give the Device as a gift." So if you purchase the device and resell it in New (unopened) condition, yeah. Fi could also pretty easily make the case that if you purchased the phone and turned around to sell it before the expiry of the original installment plan that you had purchased it with the intention of reselling. MisterAlex That's still not a commercial sale. If I go to the store, buy a Nintendo Switch, and immediately list it as a brand new Switch on Craigslist, I'm not a commercial seller. I'm still an individual selling something that's fully within my "first sale" rights to sell. james fuston Yeah, that's true if you're reading the second, and only the second, sentence there. The first one pretty clearly states "You may only purchase Devices for your personal use" MisterAlex If you think that reselling a personally owned item goes beyond the bounds of personal use, you're kidding yourself (and so is anyone who thinks that line of thinking would hold water, legally speaking). First Sale is a very broad consumer protection, my friend. Once you buy something of your own, you can do whatever you want with it, including sell it. (Edit: in the States, anyway.) james fuston Yep! Totally fine for you to sell it. Also totally fine for Google to deactivate your phone when you've done something you agreed not to do at the time of purchase. It's then legally on you to prove that they overstepped. MisterAlex You're clearly not parsing what I'm posting. Selling privately owned property is within the bounds of "personal use." james fuston Seeing as Google specifically included a clause about gifting, I'd venture to say they disagree with you. MisterAlex That's fine. Sony also disagreed that it had done anything wrong by removing Other OS. james fuston Cool! So we agree that whether or not you believe Google's terms of service to be legal, it's entirely on the customer to take action after being penalized for a violation of said terms of service. MisterAlex It's always up to the wronged party to seek litigation against a wrongdoer. james fuston In that case, I have no idea why you started commenting on legality when I was discussing terms of service violations. Rather, I would have no idea why if this weren't the comment section. MisterAlex A TOS is not a legally binding agreement. You defended enforcement of a TOS when that enforcement went contrary to law. That's why I brought up the comparison to Sony's PS3 lawsuit (which it lost). james fuston I'm not discussing whether terms of service are legally binding. I'm discussing whether or not the action being described (selling the phone) violates the ToS. It does. MisterAlex And my counter was to point out that putting something in a TOS doesn't make it hunky-dory. In fact, it's quite possible for a TOS to violate law. As I've illustrated. bekifft This is where America is so great. Even if the TOS is unenforceable by law, it is technologically enforceable, obviously. So they do it anyway, and now the onus is on you the little guy to get the multinational corporation to knock it off. Vape John most likely carrier issues the blacklisting... so project fi is the culprit psychic99 More profit? The sell them $150 below market rates. That is not free. I don't know what is actually going on but I would suspect that the original owner did something wrong or unethical. To be honest Google's systems are weird. I ported out my nexus5x and it took them almost 3 months to Bill me for the remainder. So maybe the original person cancelled their card, played games with DPP, activated it for one day and did it again. And again. xyz Fortunately, you can just buy an iPhone and get top notch support. hunter2 So the answer is to buy everything new and toss the old device in the landfill? Kind of sad to see how people just roll over and let over-reaching companies basically decimate the second hand market so they can increase their profits. Jay Never said that and you know it. I said this is the risk you take.. It's as simple as that. trixnkix637 That's the risk you take for not buying from reputable sources. Buying used has risks. Sucks he found out the hard way. jb0nez But the article says it's not Google, it's the carrier who blacklisted. Whatever that means... hunter2 That makes no sense. The carrier technically blocks that IMEI on their network, but only after another carrier submits it to the blacklist. It would be like if you SWATTED somebody and then said "it was the police who came to your house with guns not me". pfmiller On top of that this seems like an abuse of the blacklisting system. The system is intended to discourage theft, not as a means for companies to get revenge on their customers. psychic99 That's not true. Companies have been blacklisting devices for years if tos wasn't met. I have bought 3 phones through fi and they are heavily discounted. Google doesn't do that for free they expect you to activate them on fi for more than one day. Also if you are buying a phone from an individual and not a dealer you are taking a risk straight up. I have had friend have their phones blacklisted when they have bought phones from people and then they turned around and reported them as stolen. Swappa is a marketplace not a arbitrator. They are facilitating a sale. You guys need to know the difference. PayPal is your friend. hunter2 That's dumb. The whole point of cancellation fees is to re-coup the cost of subsidies if you break the contract. By going a different route, the only people who are getting punished are the people buying these phones. psychic99 Lots of people don't pay them and I have seen numerous accounts where friends have bought phones and have told me they got a "deal of a lifetime" to find their devices blacklisted and guess what they were people who never paid off their termination fees or have sold them then reported them stolen. And as an individual you need to take responsibility, if you purchase anything through a private transaction you should ask for poof of sale, do they own it, have it put in writing, etc. That way if the seller does something illegal then you have a remedy. This doesn't derisk anything tho. This is good education for people, to know where responsibility lies and the risks of buying from an individual versus an established dealer. In the case of Swappa, you should buy via Paypal, so there is a remedy. You can chargeback your loss if this happens within 6 months (I have done this will unethical sellers), so they are not being punished they are being inconvenienced. But that is the RISK you take buying from an individual. hunter2 I know you want to see Google as the good guy here, but within these comments there are accounts from people who bought outright, and months later sold their Pixel's and now months after that sale are being contacted by the seller about the device being blacklisted. bekifft I think you're missing his point. It's not about Google being the good or bad guy, it's that buying something third party is inherently risky and he's right, you should ask for a chain of evidence that proves the device is legit. Maybe I'm also just tired of people claiming they can find things so cheap online, when most of it is scams like this, and just devalues the whole market. hunter2 You need to look through these comments. There are people here who bought their phones directly from Fi and after switching carriers their fully paid off phones have been blacklisted. They were the original owners and these phones were never sold. There are also people here who bought phones, used them for months, and sold them after they were fully paid off. These people are saying that the proper they sold the phones to are now coming back and telling them they're blacklisted. bekifft In that case that is indeed disturbing. I am a Fi subscriber though I bought my phone direct from the Google store. Sounds like someone made a big mistake on the back end. Lance Biddle I bought my phone from Project Fi, and it has become blacklisted after changing to another carrier. Google is definitely the bad guy right now IMO pfmiller Just because other companies have been doing it, doesn't mean that it's not an abuse of the system. It's clearly not what the blacklisting system was intended for. Lance Biddle How about when you buy the phone from Project Fi, decide to switch carriers and the phone you outright own becomes black listed. I cannot connect to the Verizon service I'm paying for. And Verizon cannot do anything about. And Google/Project Fi isn't. I've wasted way too much time on the phone trying to get this resolved. They have told me it could be 2-5+ days to get it fixed. WTF!! Never Google again. Never. J.J. I'm sorry. That sucks hard. ProductFRED Considering the original seller probably isn't going to pay people back, all Google did was fuck over a bunch of legitimate customers. iPhone reselling is also a big issue, especially on new releases, but you don't see Apple doing this. J.J. Agree 💯. Most of these customers involved (who probably have had hardware and software issues already on top​ of this) will never buy a pixel again! Cassidy James Blaede Just for the record, the majority of Pixel users likely never have hardware or software issues. I, my mom, and a couple of my friends have Pixels and haven't had any issues. You probably hear about issues on Reddit a lot because the only reason to visit the Pixel subreddit is to complain. 🙃 Jordan L no issues here too. J.J. Not a redditer lol, but many other sites show the issues(as low as they may be) and if you were on the fence about spending that kind of money, these stories alone may sway many Duder12 Yep. Just like iphone touch disease and early shutdowns. Tr3ple Never had those issues. xyz That's true. I personally don't know anyone who has been murdered. Therefore, no one gets murdered. Cassidy James Blaede I'd wager that the majority of people don't get murdered. 😉 Written Description My Pixel XL has performed flawlessly since its purchase and it's my first Android phone after using every iPhone from the first generation on. Google's AI is better, its cloud storage is infinitely better, and I don't see going back to Apple anytime soon. J.J. I'm glad you have not had issues.... Others however have Duder12 Not me. Corey Kinard 3rd Np. Duder12 Mines been great... atl3630 great here too. Cael Apple is not a "carrier". ProductFRED Neither is Google. They just use other carriers' networks. Either way, that isn't justification for what they're doing. Unless they plan on replacing everyone's Pixel (which looks like a hard no), they fucked over a lot of legitimate customers. I buy my devices off of swappa most of the time. Tell me how I would get this fixed if neither the seller nor Google want to take responsibility. marcusmarcus2 Google is an MVNO. Per https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-an-mvno-cell-phone-carrier-578673 "An MVNO is a cell phone carrier (such as a prepaid wireless carrier) that typically does not have its own network infrastructure and licensed radio spectrum" Apple is not even an MVNO carrier. drksilenc fi is a carrier... JD With Fi Google is a Carrier. Mitch Gray This just happened to my fiance's phone. I bought it on swappa for her birthday months ago because Google store didn't have any in stock and this morning it is blacklisted. I'm so furious. I have had every Google phone since the Galaxy Nexus and because of this policy I will never buy another phone of theirs. She is now stranded without a phone and has no way of using it for work at the busiest time of the year for her (she is a teacher and it's graduation week). Who do I contact about this? We shouldn't be punished because someone gamed the system. J.J. I feel so bad for you. I hope you get it resolved. This is an atrocity! J.J. Should definitely hassle fi/Google and let them know if they don't resolve you will never buy and tell everyone you know not to buy and so on jibust No, stop don't tell them that, they might not withstand the shock of loosing them. /S T4rd I would contact the seller of the phone and/or Swappa if they're the service you went through. If they're no help somehow, then contact Paypal if that's how you paid for it. Google isn't going to unblacklist the phone regardless of what you say to them. It's virtually impossible for a phone to be unblacklisted once it has happened, so you're going to have to just get a refund and buy another phone. A Person Good luck with that. I am hesitant to ever buy again from Swappa.. and I used to love, love, love them. I purchased a device that was blatantly not as described. I then contacted Swappa and they instructed me that it is now between me and the seller. So I contacted the seller via the sale page and was basically told: "ummmm, nah". datkidpatrick at that point you could have went thru paypal and filed a claim... T4rd That's why you buy from reputable sellers. The few minor issues I've had on there were resolved quickly. atl3630 yes, same here. To date I've never had a swappa problem that didn't get resolved and the people have been very helpful. Don't blame swappa for shitty sellers. Buy from reputable sellers (like me). yankeesusa Swappa only helps communicating. To resolve any issues you must file a PayPal claim. datkidpatrick contact the seller and see if they can contact project fi/google... King_Android Ijs, BBB is an extremely powerful tool in order to get your voice heard from Corporate asap...... Stephen Hicks If the phone is under warranty still, file an RMA claim and state the bluetooth isn't working correctly on the device and that you've already tried factory resetting the phone as well as reconnected all the bluetooth devices with no improvement. Might work? njn There is no warranty for second hand phones. JRock I purchased a bootlooping 6P off eBay for cheap, erasing/flashing firmware had same result, RMA'd to Huawei and they promptly sent me a brand new one. Mark Depending on the credit card you used to buy the phone, you might have an extended warranty that might cover this. atl3630 You can get your money back. Contact the seller through swappa and tell them the issue. They will likely tell you it's been to long, I don't care, etc. If so, then file a PayPal claim. You have six months PayPal protection. Document that the phone no longer works and send it back to the seller with tracking. Then PayPal will refund you money, no matter what the seller says. M3D1T8R But doing this will just end up screwing over the seller. PayPal will simply take the money from their account and refund it to the buyer. So that's not fair to the seller either. PayPal's "seller protection" is a fraud. And their customer service is a total joke. They should be boycotted. atl3630 How does that screw over the seller? The seller screwed himself when he sold the phone. His beef is with ProjectFi, not the buyer. Frankly the buyer shouldn't have to deal with this crap since buyers have no way to determine the history of a phone. The seller sold a phone that stopped working. That's on them. M3D1T8R Because, obviously, the seller doesn't necessarily know the history and every previous owner of every phone. What if it's a phone someone bought previously used. They used it for a while just fine, and resold it. Then this IMEI block thing happened. atl3630 Yeah, that would suck. But still, it's not the buyer's fault. If something happens and somebody gets cheated out of $500+ then you better bet people are going to exercise whatever option they can to recover their money. PayPal protection would do that for them in the first 6 months. ericshmerick So anyone who sells a phone is on the hook for its functionality until the end of time? GTFO of here with that. It's ridiculous and you know it. atl3630 Six months, moron. PayPal protection is 6 months. Like it or not, facts. Stop being a little bitch. Roh_Mish What if the seller had bought directly from google. AP mentioned about the trains but there doesn't appear to to be a link between this and that fraud. Also there are many cases where buyer on PayPal will request a reverse and never return the product, screwing over the seller. And PayPal won't do anything about this. vn33 That really sucks .. .especially to someone near and dear to you. I would be beyond furious! Hope everything works out!! Duder12 Swappa will cover you here. You are fine. Get the ball rolling. Anwar Imraan Lucas To me it seems that the original buyer had reported his credit card lost or stolen and is disputing charges on his card which in terms maybe blacklisting those devices as stolen.. blindexecutioner You do Google the service of endless beta testing their software on a way overpriced phone and they blacklist you. Nice. Lawrence Good, that is what you get for buying the Bezel XL ericshmerick OH YOUUUU!!1 theadamsegal Yet another reason I will not buy a Google device again. Tiberian For the record: Kyle Bennett is the owner and founder of HardOCP, not just a simple writer for the site. ;) Richard Gao Did not know that. Thanks! datkidpatrick this happened by to me as well... i sold my pixel 3 months ago and the buyer just informed me it was blacklisted... i had no clue project fi was doing this and legit thought the buyer was trying to scam me... i contacted project fi support and was advised it was escalated to be removed from the blacklist... i paid off the phone before i sold it... this is definitely a mistake by google/project fi... they should be correcting this soon... Jordan L Can a carrier just randomly blacklist IMEIs?! I guess so. I was reading this thread thinking 'well, people probably just bought a stolen Pixel unknowingly' but your case proves this wrong. Navneet Suresh Shitty move Google ! :/ Jay If this happened to me, I'd just return the phone to the seller, get refunded, and make them have to deal with this. Swappa made a huge fucking deal about refunding buyers after the Note7 debacle and it should be the same thing here. freshprince_87 I hope that Kyle guy reads your comment. This may help him Jay Honestly, Swappa needs to be pushing this harder. I sold my Note7 last year and despite the fact that the buyer could have gone and gotten the refund from T-Mobile themselves, they chose to take Swappa up on their suggestion of getting the refund from me. (Add to this that Swappa said if I didn't agree to the refund, they'd "suggest" the buyer take the issue up with PayPal as the device was not sold as advertised. Seriously..) datkidpatrick it isn't the sellers fault... and its something that can be fixed... Jay I fail to see how this isn't the seller's fault for trying to game the system and make a profit. This sure as hell isn't Google's fault.. so who do you want to blame then? The unsuspecting buyers? datkidpatrick it is googles fault... the point they referred to in november is completely separate from the issue happening now... the issue happening now is many pixel phones that were sold and originated from fi is getting blacklisted... i sold my pixel after paying it of legit and it just got blacklisted... now please tell me how i tried to game the system... Jay For all I know, you could be one of those shady scalpers too who tried to make a profit by gaming the system. The burden of fixing this issue should still lie on the sellers. If someone wants their money back, they have every right to make you do the legwork of figuring out how you'll make your money back. datkidpatrick I contacted project fi for the buyer and it is escalated... again the point is it wasn't my fault... marcusmarcus2 If you are just trying to sell 1 phone that you got and paid for without trying to "game the system" it is not your fault, but it is your responsibility as the seller to try and resolve the issue, which it sounds like you are doing. Who's fault is it? Hard to tell until Google releases a comment about why this is happening. Did they block these by mistake? Then it is Googles fault. Are they doing it to block the bulk buyers that were "gaming the system" and just went over board and blocked some extra phones that were not part of those that gamed the system? Then it would be the fault of Google and those that gamed the system that caused Google to make the choice. hunter2 I wouldn't say it's his responsibility. He's selling a device. If the maker of that device decides to flip a kill switch in 18 months and disable every device out there then why blame him. Google is flipping a kill switch an all kinds of devices (just below there is a comment from a guy who bought and paid for his phone, then later switched carriers and had his originally bought phone killed). Trying to blame middle men here is crazy. marcusmarcus2 I'm not blaming the seller. Please re-read. I said the fault is with Google if they are the ones that decided to black list them. It is the sellers responsibility to try figure out why a device they sold is blacklisted. If they did nothing wrong, then they should be able to get it unblacklisted by working with Google. From the looks of some of the comments on here, it looks like the buyer would not be able to get the device of the black list but the seller should be able to. Again, I'm not blaming the middle man. There is a difference between fault and responsibility. Fault sounds like it is fully on Google. Responsibility goes across everyone though with some having more responsibility. Buyer has some responsibility to report the issue to the seller instead of just reporting it to paypal. Seller has more responsibility than the seller because they would be the one who would be able to work with Google/fi to get it off the black list. Google/fi would have even more responsibility to explain why devices are being blacklisted and getting devices off the black list if they should not be on there. Max As a somewhat frequent seller/buyer on Swappa and Ebay I can say that this is definitely the sellers responsibility to fix the problem or promptly accept a return for a refund otherwise this isn't so different from a bait and switch situation. datkidpatrick how is it a bait and switch if i paid off a phone legit and decided to sell it after... 3 months later it gets blacklisted... this is a mistake by google and its their responsibility to fix... Max If you paid off the phone legit and didn't do anything shady then it wouldn't have been blacklisted and if it was you, as the original buyer, are the one with more authority to contact Google, not the second hand buyer, therefore it's your responsibility to fix it. The buyer with a blacklisted phone has zero reasons to believe that you were truthful in your description even if you were. datkidpatrick well i did contact project fi for the buyer and it is escalated... Max Then you're doing the right thing (taking responsibility) and hopefully this gets resolved quickly by Fi! Although I don't know if they can just un-blacklist a phone? Hopefully they can. ericshmerick If I buy a product from a retail store and 92 days later it has an issue, guess what they will tell me when I show up barking for a refund? Yeah, pound sand kid. That's what they will say. So why do Swappa sellers suddenly have the responsibility to refund forever ala Costco? I get people are pissy at the situation, but the seller isn't responsible for Google's shadyness here. Max We're not talking about "an issue" here because that's what warranties are for, we're talking about a phone reported as lost/stolen after being sold this could potentially mean a fraudster that didn't fully pay the phone or a thief that sold a stolen phone, I doubt any serious retailer would do that... By the way that's what buyer protections are for, Paypal has six months of protection and credit card providers can be very flexible if you explain your case well and you're in the right. If a retailer pull something like this they would never win a chargeback. Max We're not talking about "an issue" here because that's what warranties are for, we're talking about a phone reported as lost/stolen after being sold this could potentially mean a fraudster that didn't fully pay the phone or a thief that sold a stolen phone, I doubt any serious retailer would do that... By the way that's what buyer protections are for, Paypal has six months of protection and credit card providers can be very flexible if you explain your case well and you're in the right. If a retailer pull something like this they would never win a charge back and the manufacturer and distributor would never be involved in the original transaction or charge back, it would be up to the retailer to go after the manufacturer or distributor. ericshmerick But nothing shady or illegal is going on here. If I and the original buyer and I use it on project fi for two months, then decide to sell it. How does that suddenly implicate me as being some sort of shady criminal? I would simply be selling a legally purchased piece of hardware that was paid in full. Max Can you please elaborate how the buyer knows that you sold "a legally purchased piece of hardware that was paid in full" if he has a blacklisted phone reported as lost/stolen in the hands? Good luck convincing the buyer, Paypal and a Bank that you're in the right in such a situation... Luxferro If they sold you shady (stolen or not legal) products you'd be dealing with them. tnt These are not devices being bought from an official retailer. There's no need to question the history of a device bought from Costco. Swappa (and Ebay and Craigslist for that matter) are not the same type of market. It's the seller's responsibility to know the history (as much as possible anyway) of the devices they're selling. freshprince_87 I guess it's safer to buy a Verizon Google Pixel instead if you intend on reselling it later. So the future buyer isn't screwed by Google. That is such a ridiculous policy drksilenc have to have a line with verizon to do that though. Wendell Brown Apparently not, this dude says his WERE Verizon phones that were locked.... https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/6d2yse/2_of_my_3_google_pixel_phones_blacklisted_on_the/ Me Google is just shooting themselves in the foot at this point with the Pixel Yan Qin I just sold my Pixel XL and switch to Galaxy S8, I do think I was out of my mind that I actually bought Pixel at full price. Jordan L anyone resell a project fi phone NOT through Swappa and have it blacklisted? maybe ProjectFi blacklisted only Swappa phones(still a strange move if it was on purpose) Jagermeister 2 of my 3 Pixel phones showed up blacklisted 2 days ago. I made a reddit post yesterday of my issue. I though it was part of an insurance fraud scam. https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/6d2yse/2_of_my_3_google_pixel_phones_blacklisted_on_the/ I had originally though our phones were from Verizon not Google Fi. We were happy Pixel customers that are now considering purchasing different phones because Google can report as stolen whenever they feel a Google Fi device was not transferred to a new owner per their TOS. How can any user purchasing a pre-owned or "new" Google Pixel be sure that it isn't a Google Fi device and won't be blacklisted in the future? Max Johnson Note to self, don't buy second hand Google devices. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Note to everyone: Don't buy first hand Google devices. Max Why? Mine works perfectly fine and so far it's the best phone I've ever owned. Dana Yeah, it's fine as long as you don't get it from Project Fi because you can't sell it if you want to upgrade to a new device. Max LOL, what? I simply bought it directly from store.google.com, no issues here and I can provide proof. This is something related to phones sold through Fi. hunter2 Congrats, scroll up one comment and you'll find a guy who's phone is blacklisted despite him being the original owner and being fully paid off. To answer your question of "Why", it's because not everyone is as comfortable gambling with their money as you are. Max 1) It was blacklisted by the carrier, not the manufacturer. 2) It was blacklisted after it was resold, sucks but as far as we know it doesn't affect the original seller, there's a difference there. 3) We don't know yet why this really happened. 4) Even with all of the above, I don't see how it fits in a "Don't buy first hand Google devices." statement. Maybe if you tell me "Don't deal with Project Fi service" I could somewhat agree. hunter2 http://disq.us/p/1iz7ts3 Sorry, should have permalinked the comment since the order is moving per votes. That guy was the original owner and claims to have been paid off. Moved to Verizon at some point and had the device he originally bough directly from Google blacklisted. Max Well that negates my point 2 and sucks even more. But still the blame here points 100% to Project Fi and not the phone itself nor Google as the manufacturer of the phone. Something really strange is happening with Project Fi devices and hopefully they will find out soon if it's an error, incompetence, sabotage or maybe even hacking. hunter2 I guess it depends on how willing you are to absolve the parent company of things a specific branch is doing. It would be like saying "don't blame MS, it's the IE team who makes the browser" during the IE6 days. Max Legally is evident that the responsibility is on Google but if you think that the group in charge of designing and manufacturing the Pixel has any minimal clue about what happens inside the group of the MVNO Project Fi then you're frankly clueless about how such a huge company works. By the way IE and Edge sucks but Visual Studio rocks and I'm liking more Windows 10 recently but I guess I should avoid using everything Microsoft because IE really sucks, right? hunter2 If a decisions like these can be made without going far enough up the chain of command that you're dealing with some higher ups, then I don't really want to know how this company runs. It's enough to tell me that I can't really trust them because you can't really depend on a company keeping in line with their corporate ideals when individual units can work with this much impunity. Avoiding/disliking MS was never about IE sucking. It was about IE being openly hostile and damaging to the web. This complaint was obviously projected at Microsoft themselves since no one believed that the IE team was working in a bubble. I don't know how old you are so maybe you weren't around when all this was going on. It's not about disliking a company because one or some of their many products are inferior. It's about disliking them because they employ user hostile tactics and you don't feel like you can support that (or at the very least want to punish them in the tiny way you can by voting with your wallet). Max So you already got an official response from Google about this? Can you share it? Because so far I have only read guesses about what is happening and nothing official yet. I'm old enough to have used MS-DOS 5 & 6 as well as Windows 3.1. That doesn't change the fact that saying "don't buy anything from a company" based on one division issues is just silly. If Google officially says that all of this was planned then maybe you could have a point, until then you're just stretching facts to prove a weak point. hunter2 I don't need to fill in the facts. I'm saying either way it's bad. The facts are that this happened. Additional facts about why it happened are irrelevant Max Well, if you're happy thinking like that be my guest, I guess some people is unable to see the colors and think the world is black and white. hunter2 For people whom this isn't a mundane thought experiment but are actually in a position where they need to buy a new device (not everyone is able to be without their phone until Google ultimately resolves this); the shades of gray in this scenario don't change their circumstances. The facts are that they have a phone that was remotely disabled. I'm assuming your shades of gray are the how's and why's of that? How is that of any consequence to these people? Steve_Jobroni Shut up, troll. DanSan got em! Matt This will be great for their resale value. ericshmerick Swappa comments: I GEEVE U $200 BUY NOW FINAL OFFERS!! JD Wooooo! Go Pixel, I'm definately not going near any Google hardware with a 1000ft pole now.I may use my 1001ft pole. In Many states, and at least in Canada this is not legal, you can't blacklist a phone for ToS violation. There's a very narrow list of reasons for a device to be blacklisted. Cuong This is a really shitty move from Google. At least sent a notification few days in advance and offer a way to appeal. What if a person was in an emergency situation? Imagine the lawsuit for that, Google. Why customers have to suffer because Google can't control their resellers? ericshmerick 911 always works. segag Thats Fuck all! Snowsky Mountain This may seriously make me rethink my use of Google hardware (especially phones). Stevie Do no evil Google. Do no evil. My Dixie Wrecked Yeah, they got rid of that mandate years ago. Seriously. Look it up. mxwp lol, yeah it was pretty funny. but i give Big G props for being somewhat honest about that. "hmm, we're huge now and so just cannot help to do some evil" Corey Kinard Just looked​ it up. Looks like it's still in place for Google. Alphabet's is different l though. It's "do the right thing." Sruly J Bought an unlocked Pixel yesterday for $334. Before I send it in to get checked and fixed by Google, I really should check the IMEI (normally I'd have the IMEI first, but the seller didn't give it to me). Michael D’Ambrosio "Someone with an answer." That'll get you far with Tech support. Smh vn33 Does the blacklisted phone works out of US, say in Canada? I assume yes, if it's the carriers that are doing the blacklisting. that said, it would really dampen my desire for a phone from Google. Stevie I am crossing my fingers that they don't come after my Nexus 6. Already bought and activated. There's no going back right? speedy1979 So to clarify google is randomly blacklisting any google pixel that is resold. I actually considered buying a ProjectFi device sometime ago; so glad I didn't go through with it. Kris Crowley I have fi service. When you buy a phone through fi you got a discount or a phone that you can't get through the Google store if you want. There is a disclaimer that if you buy it and never activate it that you will be charged additional Monies within 30 days. Now without knowing isn't possible that A the phone was bought at a discount and B the additional fee was levied but never paid? trixnkix637 Know the risks of buying used people. Do your homework. Asking where the seller bought the phone originally could've prevented all of this. Can't blame Google because someone tried to game the system both ways. marcusmarcus2 Know the risks of not using commas, people. You should never buy people, whether they are used or new. Rony Hmmm, is there a difference between a new and a used person. I've scoured the forums and haven't got a clear answer. marcusmarcus2 You would have to ask them before you buy them. They usually know when they've been used. But again, you should not buy any people. Def Ref But if you try to rent people, you start hearing words like "solicitation" and that's no fun. marcusmarcus2 Don't rent them either. While we are at it. Do not borrow, loan or steal people. Def Ref Is enticement allowed in your no fun world? Asking for a friend. marcusmarcus2 I don't see a problem with enticement as long as that enticement does not lead to stealing people. "No fun world"? You mean my world where I think people should not be viewed or treated as items/property? If yes, then yeah, I guess it is a no fun world. Def Ref Lighten up, Francis. marcusmarcus2 Lighten up, Francis? https://38.media.tumblr.com/39ef7347a58e308e67a5bd01cd124431/tumblr_nsld6lafvE1qh124lo1_500.gif Def Ref https://youtu.be/0OnpkDWbeJs That the title is misspelled AND mispunctuated is bonus. trixnkix637 Didn't NY and NV allow for the renting of people or is that wishful thinking? Asking for a friend. Rod This was so good, I had to sign into Disqus to upvote. trixnkix637 Buying people has been around for ages. Can't just stop now because of commas. marcusmarcus2 Buying used has been around for ages. trixnkix637 And so has it's risks. ericshmerick Wow I feel bad for the Swappa sellers who are getting PayPal charge backs right about now. Alexander Z Great This was the response I received. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/948da6656e25823e8dc529c4571fbc2d347f5e820ee9b7c91844d48c9745a112.png DanSan owner of the device ≠ person who purchased. way to go google. InnocentEd News flash this could happen with any phone from any manufacturer on any network that is resold used. I've had it happen with 2 iPhones and Apple could have cared less. You buy used, you take the risk. It's amazing how even credited tech journalists assume devices on Swappa are always going to be 100% safe. If Project Fi were not allowed to be resold via T&S then it's no diff than blacklisting a resold stolen phone...they had every right. Bewear This is why we can't have nice things. Rony Honestly this makes total sense. Its technically stealing the phone if you buy it for a discounted price and you dont activate it and sell it again. I think they made the right move. raffr It's not "technically" stealing. If you purchase a product at the price requested, you did not steal it. IF, big IF, in your purchase agreement it states you cannot resell the phone without activating it first, then google has a case. Serge Cebrian if you are paying for the service ... you are still paying for it even if you keep your older phone or a better phone if you want to unless you stop paying then its stealing ... but not if you keep the service// marcusmarcus2 They could have blacklisted these phones for that reason. But they could have also been overzealous when blacklisting devices and blacklisted numerous other devices that people did not do that with. It may have been the right move to block those that did do that, but if they inadvertently blocked additional devices, then hopefully they make the right move and unblock those devices that should not have been blocked. newtonfb Not new. Wife got a 5x on swappa. Phone was originally on FI but never taken off the account. We tried to activate it on FI but they did we couldn't until the owner released the phone? It worked fine on any other carrier. Had to get a new 5x Lance Biddle I paid off my pixel through project fi. I recently switched to Verizon. Yesterday Verizon notified me that my phone had been reported as stolen! When I awoke this morning my service had been disabled by Verizon. The support from Project Fi has been abysmal. What do I do to fix this? Corey Kinard Go to Reddit. Get ready for talks with the Better Business Bureau. Keep contacting Fi, keep screenshotting all the correspondences, you get all the buyers info in order to prove you are the original device owner. You don't fix this, you didn't cause it to break. Google fixes this. Everyone affected just has to light a fire under their ass. tnt Keep pushing / escalating with Project Fi. Ryan from GroupTweet I bought a Pixel from Tradeport USA (NH based company, shit!) about 3 months ago. The phone is on T-mobile right now and still currently working (fingers crossed). From my interpretation this appears only to be affecting Pixels bought through Google Fi - and perhaps not ones bought via Google Play store unlocked? Is that correct? Is there anyway I can check to see if my pixel was in fact sold via Google FI vs Google Play? Really hoping I don't wake up to a bricked phone in the next couple mornings... Sruly J You could contact Google, provide them with the IMEI, and they could let you know if it was bought through Google Play. Ryan from GroupTweet Thanks - but don't want to risk tipping them off that my phone should be on the blacklist :( Sruly J But wouldn't they know anyways if it should be blacklisted? I mean, how else would they have blacklisted so many phones this week? lauriedesautels So I have the Pixel and was planning on selling it via Swappa after my credits end from another phone. They ended up giving me a brand new Pixel XL but their service has become horrible where I live. So please correct me if I am wrong but if the Pixel is paid off and I switch carriers/ my Pixel is a paperweight? (I don't plan on using the phone on another carrier after 3 mo). ericshmerick According to this place, you can never sell it. You must carry it with you to your grave. Robert Montoya I have a Pixel that is currently blacklisted as of 5/23/2017 I bought it from Swappa... Google says they will lift the ban in 24 to 48 hours... That was 24 hours ago.. Phone still Blacklisted Wendell Brown I must have missed where it was shown that these deactivated phones were on Project Fi. As best I can tell, the only link to Fi is from an OLD article about the guy reselling phones several months ago. Is there any proof that this is in any way Fi related? MadJoe I have to say, if Google ever blacklisted my phone in a misguided sour-grapes attempt to punish the person who sold it to me, and without compensating me for it I would be rather angry. It would also be the absolute last Google product I ever purchased. As it is, this story has me glad I don't own anything more than a $25 Chromecast that I never use. I was seriously considering the Pixel 2 as my next phone, but not any more. If they were going to be such babies about the phones being resold, they should have vetted their buyers a little better. Corey Kinard It doesn't look like they were making any money off of you in the first place... Second-hand buyers/ bargain hunters rarely go out and pre-order $800 phones. Maybe you're different. They're definitely fucking up, but considering how little the pixel one sold and how much money they make I'm not sure they'll care about this any which way the wind blows. Same way Apple can just outright tell their customers to go fuck themselves over certain problems. MadJoe The problem is that too many people will ignore a company's unscrupulous behavior. If more of us would punished them by taking away access to our wallets, they'd think twice about trying to screw us. But people are lazy and lack commitment. So you're absolutely right, Google won't feel any hit by my deciding not to buy any more of their shit because a shit-ton of blind lemmings will gladly line up to jump off that spot on the cliff I chose not to use. And when a couple of them get screwed, they will cry "why isn't anyone else interested in helping me?" as the rest of the heard ignore them. On the bright side, the cycle will continue ad nauseum until I'm in a hole in the ground. Bruce Considering the ridiculous amount they are charging for the phones (Apple pricing without the Apple level support), this just about kills the resale value for a Pixel. Who the hell is going to buy a used phone for $500+ (because the original cost is so high) if their phones get blacklisted months later. And who the hell is going to buy the phones at the original price, when resale value will drop like a rock. And this doesn't even take into account all the BS that comes with the phone to begin with. 2 years of guaranteed OS updates. Hardware issues (Bluetooth, speakers, water resistance...) which don't get acknowledged amid finger pointing. Insufficient inventory even if they were open to replacements. The 128GB version (the 32GB is too little and the 64 GB doesn't exist) costs almost a $1000. The first time they tried this with the Nexus One, it didn't go well. This doesn't seem to be going much better. The Galaxy Nexus couldn't be upgraded because of drivers. The only real hits have been the Nexus 5 and the 6P. UniBroW *clutches iPhone 7 plus despite it's inferiority to android* Tj Hariharan Wait, do we actually KNOW that the phones that are blacklisted were originally purchased for reselling for profit? All i got from this article was that the phone was originally purchased from Project Fi.. RTNDO128 My phone was effected by this. I've been having issues with no T-Mobile service for the past couple of days on Project Fi. After reading this article, I used the Swappa IMEI checker and what do you know, my phone is reported "lost/stolen". I bought my Pixel on eBay at the beginning of January. Now I'm beyond their 30 day gaurentee. What an absolute clusterfuck. RTNDO128 My phone was effected by this. I've been having issues with no T-Mobile service for the past couple of days on Project Fi. After reading this article, I used the Swappa IMEI checker and what do you know, my phone is reported "lost/stolen". I bought my Pixel on eBay in the middle of February. Now I'm beyond their 30 day guarantee. What an absolute clusterfuck. Y2J You have 180 days in Paypal. RTNDO128 Thanks, I filed a claim with them. Hopefully this situation is covered. Max Did you contact first the seller? Otherwise it's a dick move to file a claim without first giving the seller the opportunity to see if he collaborates... RTNDO128 Thanks for your opinion. As stated, I'm beyond the 30 day eBay guarantee window. I created a "dispute" through the PayPal Resolution Center, which sends a message directly to the seller. PayPal is totally uninvolved with the dispute until I choose to escalate, which will only happen if I cannot get this resolved with the seller first. I just want to have our conversations documented in the event that the seller does not want to deal with this situation. Ken Kinda weird Google said that IMEI can't be blocked by manufacturer, I'm sure that's true. But what when manufacturer is also technically the carrier? Da_James Are you saying that "buying" a device in the USA doesn't mean you own it? Just SUE. Steve_Jobroni > as it's the carrier and not the manufacturer that has the ability to blacklist devices Do people not read the full article anymore? There seems to be a lot of Jabroni's blaming Google when it's the carrier that can only do the blacklisting. Sir_Brizz But that carrier is Project Fi, aka Google... Aleksandr Ivanov Change IMEI, problem solved! AbdulB1 lol Cassidy James Blaede I'd be interested in hearing how widespread this actually is, and a response from Google. My mom bought a Pixel from Swappa because Google was out of stock, and she's been loving it. I'd hate for her phone to become a brick because of this. Leonardo Baez I see a class action demand on the horizon? Đức Thành I'm a die-hard Google fan, but wow does Google need some fixing. justmy2pennies2012 There is one simple way Google can prevent the second hand market from making a profit. 1. Provide enough stock for all those who want to purchase the device! :) Bonus: Price the device accrodingly!! I gave up trying to buy one new from VZW and the Play Store. MisterAlex Did getting a Pixel phone through Fi require signing away your rights regarding "first sale?" And is that enforceable? RayNeverLearns You are Android Police. You might want to stay more up to date on this story and keep your readers updated, especially one that has a big impact on one of the purest Android flagships. http://www.techspot.com/news/69452-pixel-phones-project-fi-showing-up-blacklisted.html datkidpatrick happy to announce the phone i sold has been taken off the blacklist after communicating with project fi... so if you're affected by this contact google or more specifically project fi support... RayNeverLearns I believe Project Fi has done this for all affected Pixels. I didn't contact the person who sold it to me (Craigslist 7 months ago... wouldn't know where to even start) yet my phone was whitelisted earlier today. A little pain and it took almost 3 days, but a good resolution. datkidpatrick thats great... happy it's fixed... Amir What an idiotic move by Google. That's suicide.

Image Credit: Robbie Shade Google has reportedly launched a new program to support promising AI ventures. The initiative will provide services ranging from mentorship to workspace, according to Axios. The most promising startups or projects may receive co-investments from the new initiative and Google Ventures ranging from $1 million to $10 million. A Google spokesperson declined to comment. The new initiative could have something to do with Google’s recent acquisition of Kaggle, a data science startup that hosted competitions in which data scientists solve challenges provided by other companies. A series of new AI initiatives were recently announced at I/O, the annual Google developer conference, including the unveiling of a second-generation tensor processing unit for AI processing in the cloud and an invitation for mobile developers to use TensorFlow Lite. As part of its initiatives to democratize AI, Google also recently introduced the TensorFlow Research Cloud, a free AI computing service for top researchers and organizations like Harvard Medical School who are willing to share the results of their work in an open source environment.

Google is now offering four free months of Google Play Music for new subscribers Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/26 2:17pm PDTMay 26, 2017 70 Plus 1 on G+ 511 Share on Facebook 83 Share on Twitter Total Shares664 Google News Right now it looks like Google is running a special offer for Google Play Music. New subscribers that sign up here can get four free months of service instead of the usual three. No telling how long this offer might last, so if you have been considering subscribing, now might be the time to do it. It could save you an extra $10. Again, this particular offer is only for new subscribers. I've been a fan of Play Music for a long time, though the device removal limit does get in the way when you switch between devices and ROMs as often as I do. Being able to mix your own library with those of a service also comes in handy. That way I can continue to support artists I am passionate about, without eschewing the larger selection of a subscription offering for the purposes of content discovery, all while being able to fill the gaps in that library. There are a lot of different music services out there, but if you're interested combining your curated library with music available via a subscription, then your options are limited. Spotify does allow you to play back locally stored files, which is convenient, but it isn't quite the same. Amazon also allows you to upload your music for playback via Amazon Music, and with Amazon Prime membership, you get a small library of streaming music to go along with that. For $10 a month ($8 for Prime members) you can access their full library as well. But, Google Play Music has a great interface and plugs nicely into all the other Google services we love. Maybe with this new offer, it's time you gave Google Play Music a chance? After all, even if it doesn't end up working out, you still got four free months of music out of the deal.

Carson Saldanha Wait, wdym 3 different countries? Did you share it with others or something? Ailín Ó’S I live in Ireland, so that's my main account. I have a secondary account based in England as part of a mail forwarder service I use, and my bf is Greek so I had him check the code on his account :) Carson Saldanha Oh wow! Carson Saldanha Hey, since I know it worked for you, are you able to use YouTube Red along with this Play Music free trial? Because my YT Red doesn't seem to be enabled for me. Ailín Ó’S No, unfortunately not as I live in the EU and YouTube Red is only available in USA. Carson Saldanha Weird, I'm in the US though. Ailín Ó’S Ooh that is odd. Sign out of the app then sign back in maybe? Carson Saldanha No luck :( I'm in contact with Google support atm Hopefully they can sort this out Mike Worth it alone for Youtube Red MisterAlex Sweet, I wasn't sure if that was included. Thanks. Should mention that in the main blog post. Ben Still no student membership >:( Ailín Ó’S Spotify is a great alternative @€$£5/month. Ben I know that's what I use just because it's half the price. Ailín Ó’S In Ireland Vodafone have a partnership with Spotify whereby it costs €5 standard instead of €10 regardless of if you're a student or not, they even bundle it with some of their plans. Vodafone do the same in some other countries they operate in (not all). Maybe see if any network in your country has a partnership like that? Worth a shot! Ben Oh yeah I'm on EE in the UK and I've got Apple Music for free for 6 months but like iTunes is a massive stinking turd. Ailín Ó’S I'd rather go back to the days of getting music via Bluetooth from friends than use crApple Music 😂😂 Rahul Krishna In india, we have play music for 1.4 usd/month Umang Ladia I'm only seeing 2 months offer in India.?? Rahul Krishna Well I subscribed to it when it launched here (about 2 months ago), so I can't confirm that. But at this price, there is nothing to be disappointed about. aRvInD I wish Spotify launches soon here. I can't keep using that patched version here...!! Rahul Krishna Me too xyz As it should be, you can't charge European or American prices in India. Rahul Krishna Yes true. There are lots​ of people here with a very cheap Android phone. They cannot pay much money. Julian Coronado That's actually what's keeping me away from Play Music. I've used my free months and I loved the Youtube Red too. But as a student, Spotify for $5 / month is too great to pass up on. Emiliejmosley Google is paying 97$ per hour! Work for few hours & have longer with friends and family! !sm141c: On tuesday I got a great new Land Rover Range Rover from having earned $8752 this last four weeks.. Its the most-financialy rewarding I've had..

Cakefish Spotify ftw ToniCipriani ✓pǝᴉɟᴉɹǝʌ I don't think this is a new offer, got this a while back. In fact my 4 months is expiring next week. Prefer Spotify over it. Song selection a tad bit weaker, and for foreign songs it tries to translate the song names to English and makes it hard to look up. folkrav I like it, it's way cheaper than Spotify for me - my mother, my sister, my wife and myself each pay 30$ a year and we're set - but Jesus do I hate the clients. I don't like the website's interface, I hate the Android app. But yeah, I'll deal with it cause it's cheap, I guess. Carson Saldanha Got it! Yay! Jim I wish I could somehow get it on my Amazon Echo hahaha. I guess if I had paid for a Google Home it would be worth trying out. Forget vega #getEVGA Why google play music isn't available in my country ? Ailín Ó’S Try Apple Music? They seem to be just about everywhere. Iamsecond And this is why Apple continue to dominate, because Apple are truly interested in being an international company whereas Google is just playing at it. Such a shame xyz Because Google sucks. Bartek Juszczak My GPM radio's are so good these days I love that Google is so into AI. Whether It's just "I'm being lucky" or radio from a specific song, band or album they very rarely disappoint me these days. I just make sure to thumbs up if it plays a song I particularly love. I am a student and could go cheaper with spotify but the AI generated playlists have me locked in. If it's £5 cheaper but I'm not gonna enjoy it nearly as much then it's not really a good deal. AndTheWorldMayNeverKnow I used the 3 or 4 months free trial during the holidays then bought the family plan for $14.99 a month. 4 people in my family us it and it works great, the app could use some tweaks but it's really good overall. paev If you listen to main stream music it doesn't really matter what service to use. However, if you like something unusual, weird or other languages then Google is a way to go. I found bands on Google music that Spotify displayed as not found. Google also have new synth bands that Spotify doesn't. I'm for Google too. Daniel I discovered that GPM is kinda like a music label. I once went to a section of Google play explaining how indie artists can use GPM like a music label as long as they own all their rights. Ryne Hager Ultraista (among others) keeps me using Google Play Music as well as Spotify. Carson Saldanha Does anyone else who activated the Play Music trial have YouTube Red working as well? My YT Red doesn't seem to be enabled while my Play Music is. Michael Carr I spotted a similar offer a couple of months ago, and I took it after a day or two's thought. Just last week, I moved directly into a family plan. PewPewYoureDead It's hard to recommend Google Play Music until they revamp the UI. Margaritas Ante Porcos Google Music is the only choice in some markets, like Russia, where no Spotify or Pandora are available. There are too many shortcomings in Google Music and Google never shows interest in making services better than below average. I really wonder why Google refuses to become the best at anything. Real magic here. Pixel syndrome all the way. Yet Google Music is on my phone and I use it because there's no choice whatsoever. Rob You answered your own question. If there's no alternative, then they don't have any incentive to improve the service. SupahNin10doh Stupid Dorito logo... Raymond Berger Huh, I just subscribed to the trial but you youtube red hasn't kicked in yet. Any idea how long it takes? Iamsecond If you live in the UK, about 2 years so far h20ray Google Play Music is currently available in select territories and for select account types. Umang Ladia I'm only seeing 2 months offer in India, anybody can confirm? Mohammad Ovais Yeah, same for me. Maybe it's region limited. Isolde I think you need to open the link in a browser, if you open it in the app it's just the normal 2 months. Manoj | Blogging Triggers Is Google Music really worth to it? We have better alternatives Sathiya Moorthy Karan I came across a great post, it seems to be so cool http://developeit.net/android-news-image-scanner-finder/ Zachariah Mann It only shows up as 2 free months for me. I live in Michigan. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/a19b7e9dddb67bf897c751aedf63c01917048214140db901fd783b2182d8d5c0.png Mikael Jakobsson Should mabye joine premium at Google Music if that coste like $2 max a month dont understand why they should take as mutch as someone some has app or Win32 software to PC so music controllers one they keyboards works. Tab out frome a game for pause music when the round is over is just bad. Arif Gürü And stil isnt available on Turkey xyz "No telling how long this offer might last, so if you have been considering subscribing, now might be the time to do it." No thanks, I'll just use YouTube. Only thing YT needs is an option to play audio only so I can save a wee bit more data when I don't need video.

Suggested Sharing is going live in Google Photos for some users Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/25 5:30pm PDTMay 25, 2017 42 Plus 1 on G+ 112 Share on Facebook 75 Share on Twitter Total Shares229 Applications Google News Google Photos is ground zero for the company's crazy machine learning technology. At Google I/O 2017, a number of new features were announced for Photos, including suggested sharing based on who's in a certain photo. But for that to work, Google needs to figure out who is who, and now the Photos web app is asking users to identify what they look like. Upon visiting photos.google.com, you may be welcomed by the above screen. Google already uses machine learning wizardry to match faces to people, so all you have to do is select which face is yours. Once you do that, you'll be able to search for "me" in the Photos search to find pictures of yourself. According to a recent teardown, this option should appear at some point in the Photos app as well, but it didn't for me. Presumably, this will be far more useful once the other features announced at Google I/O show up. Let us know in the comments if you have received the pop-up.

I got the pop up just the other day. I can search for "me" in addition to others such as my daughter's name. John Doe I did but for some reason it shows a photo of me from over 6 years ago even though I have plenty of recent photos LoL Corbin Davenport Yep, my picture was an awful photo of me from several years ago. John Doe I was able to change it by going to people then clicking on the picture and even when you choose a picture with a lot of people in it figures out which one is you and zooms in...creepy bozzykid It doesn't matter what photo you choose of yourself. The rest are all linked to you anyways. This isn't replacing your profile pic. John Doe No but some photos it has not figured out its me or at least when I click on me it doesn't show all the pictures of me but it is good enough to find pictures of me when I was a child which is crazy because I changed a lot. Stakoman Is this US only? would be great if you guys made a "how to enable face recognition google photos" post Suicide_Note Use a US VPN to start using the face recognition. Once you get things setup, you can stop using the VPN, though face recognition should still work. rndusrnm479461 You can use a VPN (get tunnelbear cause it's free) for Android, then clear cache, open photos and enable grouping of faces in the settings. Then you can disable VPN. I did this about a year ago and I've had it ever since without any problem both on Android and on the web. bozzykid I believe it uses one of the firsts photos you have stored. It has already linked the rest to you anyways. Régis Knechtel Not always, apparently, cause it used a recent photo for me. I think it's random. Brendapdaniels Google is paying 97$ per hour!

Corbin Davenport On the web, go to Settings -> Group similar faces, and there should be an option to pick your face. Yatin No, I'm from India Drakenoid Yes, I'm also from India. Naga Sridhar I am from India too, but are you in India? myssi Pop-up recieved, I'm from Pakistan. Tomáš Petrík And I guess we will be left out in the EU, again :/ Indefinite Implosion I'm in NL and got it a few days ago? A day or two after the announcement maybe (crunch time, so days are a blur). I didn't tip because it doesn't do anything right now so hardly seems worthy of a post. roberto.elena Do you already have "group similar faces" activated? If yes, then you will get this update. Tomáš Petrík No, it is disabled for accounts registered in the EU due to some stupid privacy ruling of the EU. roberto.elena I know, but you can activate it using a VPN (or at least that was possible when they launched Google Photos). Once it's activated, you don't need the VPN anymore, and you get all updates related to face recognition features. Nelson Not correct. I'm in Europe and by using Opera VPN plus Google Photos cache clear the feature appeared Amir Instead of copying and pasting your Debbie Downer response on every single comment, go try it with a VPN. Gosh! Suicide_Note Use a US VPN and you can join the party. Tomáš Petrík It's not about VPN this time. Accounts registered in the EU have facial recognition disabled due to some stupid privacy ruling of the EU. Jens Törnblad That's why you activate the feature with a VPN. Suicide_Note Ah, okay. I wasn't aware of that. Definitely sucks. Mr K Nope. I cleaned data from Google Photos and force closed, activated Tunnelbear (it's free for 500MB but you won't use more than 50) in the US and opened Photos. Configured everything (make sure face recognition" is activated in settings) and everything works fine. I just got the notification in Photos for web about this new feature. And you can of course uninstall the VPN when everything is set up. rndusrnm479461 Get tunnelbear for Android. Choose a US vpn. Clear Google Photos cache -> open it -> enable grouping of faces in the settings. You only have to do this once. I did it a year ago and it has worked ever since on all my devices. Tomáš Petrík It's not about VPN this time, though. Accounts registered in the EU have facial recognition disabled due to some stupid privacy ruling of the EU. rndusrnm479461 Really? I registered mine in EU in ~2008 and activated face grouping in early 2016 without problems. henleyb I got it a day or two ago. Was an old photo but searching for 'me' did bring up correct photos for me so that's something.

By: Tech Desk | New Delhi | Updated: May 28, 2017 10:29 am Artificial intelligence and machine learning are increasing becoming important, with players like Google, Amazon and Microsoft pumping millions of dollars. Apple might be developing a new custom chipset for artificial intelligence (AI) processing, reports Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman. The chipset, internally known as Apple Neural Engine, will be used to handle AI-related tasks like speech and facial recognition. The chipset could in incorporated into Apple’s upcoming devices such as iPhone and iPad. Gurman writes Apple’s current devices are equipped to handle artifical intelligence processes with two different chipset: the main processor or microprocessor, and the graphics chipset, or “GPU”. The custom chipset would allow Apple to offload some processing done by the main chipset and by the GPU, allowing the company to improve battery performance on its devices. The report goes on to say that Apple plans to integrate the chip into other devices, and has even tested prototypes of iPhones with the built-in chip. That said, it makes sense for Apple as its competitors in the tech industry are increasing betting on artificial intelligence (AI) for future growth. Google, for instance, has developed its own chipset for machine learning, called “TPUs”, the second-generation version of which was announced at this year’s I/O. Similarly, Qualcomm’s latest flagship processor, Snapdragon 835, has a dedicated module for an artificial intelligence (AI). According to Apple analyst Gene Munster,”Two of the areas that Apple is betting its future on require AI. At the core of augmented reality and self-driving cars is artificial intelligence.” Over the past few years, Apple has acquired a number of companies having expertise in artificial intelligence and machine learning. In 2016, Apple hired Russ Salakhutdinov from Carnegie Mellon University as its director of AI research. Most recently, Apple released its first AI research paper, which focused on machine vision technologies. Artificial intelligence and machine learning are increasing becoming important, with players like Google, Amazon and Microsoft pumping millions of dollars. It is possible that Apple could share more information about the chipset at WWDC , the annual developer conference to take place June5-9 in San Jose, California. Apple will unveil iOS 11, the latest mobile operating system, along with a new version of macOS, its computer operating system For all the latest Tech News, download Indian Express App now © IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd Tags: Apple No Comments.

A phone leaker, Evan Blass, last week, put on Twitter that the most awaited version of Android Wear will at last come. The second version of the watch, according to cnet.com report, looks to completely revamp the operating system and help make watches less reliant on phones. Aside from that, the next version will add an on-watch app store and built-in keyboard. As if it isn’t cool enough, the firm will also includes support for both Android Pay (mobile payments) and the Google Assistant, Google’s intelligent voice assistant that debuted on the Pixel smartphone. The report noted that earlier, it was already confirmed that not all Android watches will get the updated version. The original Moto 360 and LG G Watch won’t be upgraded to Android Watch 2.0.

A product called "Google Attribution" was unveiled at a marketing conference this month in San Francisco by the internet giant. Google has long been able to determine when users click on an ads and make a purchase, but linking online and offline habits takes its analytics a step further. Google senior vice president Sridhar Ramaswamy, who announced that Attribution is in test mode with a limited number of partners and will be rolled out to more advertisers in coming weeks, touted the tool as being able to answer the long-challenging question of whether marketing campaigns are working. "Google Attribution makes it possible for every marketer to measure the impact of their marketing across devices and across channels," Ramaswamy said. "Data-driven attribution uses machine learning to determine how much credit to assign to each step in the consumer journey -- from the first time they engage with your brand for early research down to the final click before purchase." Real-world customer email addresses or loyalty plan information can be woven with Google data from services such as AdWords, Google Analytics and DoubleClick Search to provide "a complete view" of marketing performance, according to the company. Using artificial intelligence, or machine learning, to better analyze and understand consumer behavior to target ads and promote sales was a major theme of the conference. - Ad 'holy grail' - For several years now, AdWords has enabled advertisers to measure visits to real-world stores stemming from online campaigns, Ramaswamy noted. "Still, measuring store visits is just one part of the equation," Ramaswamy said. "You also need insights into how your online ads drive sales for your business." Real-world transactions matched back to Google ads are handed in "a secure and privacy-safe way," with store sales information reported in aggregated and anonymized forms to protect individual privacy, according to the company. Tying online activity to offline shopping decisions has been a "holy grail" for advertisers for quite some time, and comes with worrisome privacy implications, according to ACLU senior policy analyst Jay Stanley. Attribution threatens to intrude on a core tenant of privacy, that people can have dealings with one party not spill over into affairs with other parties they interact with, Stanley contended. "This is an evolution, not a revolution; another step toward increased monitoring of individuals," Stanley said. "Each step raises the question 'Where does this all stop?'" Stanley expected Google to be on its best behavior when it came to handling the growing trove of information about users, but that even the best of intentions could crack under the "enormous hydraulic pressure of the profit motive." "We have the full fury and genius of the capitalist system being driven toward monitoring people in ever increasing detail and companies are competing to do so," Stanley said "It will not stop without some sort of rules in which we as a society express our values through legal protections." - More tempting ads? - Google and Facebook dominate the online ad world, and what one does to prove its worth to advertisers is likely to be copied by the other, according to Silicon Valley analyst Rob Enderle of Enderle Group. Attribution promised to give Google a way to assure advertisers they are getting their money's worth at the firm's online venues. "The big problem is that showing conversion from ad consumption to purchase has been horrible," Enderle said of online marketing. "This has been a problem for a long time. Google is trying to make a metric so they get credit for it when you do purchase after viewing an ad." Data showing which ads are translating into real sales should mean that the relevance of ads people see online will improve as marketers abandon mis-aimed or ineffectively tailored messages, the analyst reasoned. "You are going to be hit with ads for things that you might actually want to buy, so you are going to spend a lot more money," Enderle predicted. Worries about privacy sparked by linking offline and online activities are a decade or so late, because the time to protest was when collection began of the troves of data about people, the analyst argued. "There really is no downside to this application," Enderle said while discussing Google's marketing metrics move. "This is the good side of collecting data; it is what else is being done with the data that should be unnerving and that we really don't know."

White Share Share Tweet Comment Email Print advertisement For a company whose embrace of mobile work predates the internet and even the personal computer, IBM's decision to recall employees back to the office has human resources experts warning that the move could make it harder for Big Blue to compete with the likes of Google and Apple, along with hot startups, to recruit and retain the best people. "I think it is going to be a talent problem," said Jennifer Glass, the Barbara Bush professor of liberal arts at the Population Research Center at the University of Texas. "It's very clear in the literature that autonomy is something talented workers want, especially millennials." The back-to-the-office movement could work if management is clear about the benefits working in an office will provide. Shutterstock A survey by Flexjobs.com found that 80 percent of respondents said that flexibility was a top consideration when considering a new job, and a third reported leaving a job because it didn't offer the flexibility they needed. "People work from home for a lot of different reasons," Sara Sutton Fell, founder and CEO of Flexjobs.com, including accommodating childcare, eldercare and disabilities. "They need it. They don't just want it." Related: Researchers Say This Is the Key to Being Happy at Work Some experts say the rollback of telecommuting reflects a more seismic shift as IBM struggles to adapt to rapid changes in an industry it once dominated. "When technology companies change priorities or shift focus, there can be a change as well to how and where employees work," said Scott Dobroski, community expert at Glassdoor.com. "This is is a sign of something much bigger," said Dave Carvajal, CEO of Dave Partners, a technology-focused recruiting firm. "IBM is struggling to compete in the competitive tech marketplace that has become significantly more agile and nimble over the past decade." IBM's quarterly report last month had higher-than-expected earnings but missed analyst expectations on revenue — marking five years straight of year-over-year quarterly revenue declines. Company executives say making people work together will help reverse its fortunes. At a conference last fall, CFO Martin Schroeter talked to investors about "get[ting] the teams back together as opposed to so spread out," saying the relocation would make them "more agile." It Didn't Work for Yahoo But not everyone agrees that proximity can foster performance gains. "I'm personally a little skeptical," Sutton Fell said. "It didn't really help Yahoo." The news of IBM's reversal on telecommuting drew many comparisons to Yahoo. When CEO Marissa Mayer eliminated Yahoo's work-from-home perk in 2013, it provoked a backlash from those who said the shift placed an unfair burden on working parents — especially since the news was coupled with reports that Mayer had a nursery constructed adjacent to her office so she could bring her then-infant son to work with her. Given IBM's performance struggles, some observers suggested that the shift away from remote work could be a way to shed workers through attrition without resorting to layoffs. Related: Some Companies Encourage Employees to Disconnect During Vacation "IBM has been bringing teams like these together for several years, across many areas of the company: software development, digital marketing, Watson, design, and IBM's CIO teams, just to name a few," IBM spokeswoman Laurie Friedman said via email. She did not respond to a question about how many employees ultimately would be affected but said workers could reapply for other jobs — around 5,000 in the U.S. — with the company, and added that some workers would be able to continue working remotely. "I'm highly suspicious of this idea that if you corral everybody into the same room you're going to get magic," Glass said. "I think it's an attempt to exert more managerial control when business is down and they're under pressure to turn things around." Collaboration May Need to Be Relearned Some experts do see the potential for a positive outcome as IBM expands its work in areas like cloud computing and artificial intelligence. "We know it's an added focus on innovation," Dobroski said. "That's very enticing to today's tech talent." By making people come into the office, managers will be able to focus on more hands-on mentoring and training — benefits that attract ambitious millennials but are harder to execute with a far-flung workforce. "This is the generation that says, if I'm not learning, I'm gone," said Dayna Fellows, president of consulting company WorkLife Performance, Inc. The back-to-the-office movement could work if management is "really smart and clear" about the benefits working in an office will provide, she said. Related: Three-Day Weekends, Free Vacation Money? Taking Job Perks to the Max But to achieve this, experts say IBM will need to invest in restructuring its work environment and culture. "If they simply bring people in and expect them to work exactly the same way in a crowd situation, it will fail," Fellows said. "That would be the mistake, is if everything stays the same but people come in." "Collaboration is helped by being together, but it has to be on purpose. You have to create a culture... It doesn't just happen by bumping into each other," said Ellen Galinsky, senior research advisor at the Society for Human Resource Management. "If the problem is collaboration, that probably needs to be addressed directly. You can't just assume that if people are in the same space, they are going to collaborate and work together," she said. "Holistic change at that level requires real leadership," Carvajal said. Martha C.

Digital Trends Home > Mobile > 5 solutions to fix your Huawei P10’s… 5 solutions to fix your Huawei P10’s problems and get it back to normal By Kyree Leary — Updated May 25, 2017 1:20 am Subscribe Share Inez del Prado Photography Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: The Huawei P10 and P10 Plus are an impressive pair of smartphones, which aim to compete with the current offerings from Samsung, Google, and Apple. The devices haven’t been around for very long, and they’re currently unreleased in the United States, but that didn’t stop us from putting our ears to the digital ground to hear the complaints of the masses. You may have seen a couple of these Huawei P10 problems already, especially if you’re considering upgrading, but it never hurts to know what the big issues are, find out if they’re actually problems, and see whether solutions are available now or coming soon. Problem: Slow memory speeds This particular problem has been noticed by Chinese owners and reported on by both Engadget and Android Central. It’s not something most people would notice, but the basic issue is this: The Huawei P10 and P10 Plus should have decent flash memory speeds, or speeds that outperform older Huawei phones like the Mate 9. However, some of the company’s new handsets have not met expectations, which prompted many to wonder if something was wrong with their new smartphones, or if Huawei wasn’t being as truthful about their device’s technical specs. Official solution: The Huawei P10 and P10 Plus can have one of two chips, the older eMMC 5.1, or the newer UFS 2.0/2.1. Due to supply shortages, Huawei had to substitute the UFS chips with the eMMC, resulting in the aforementioned slower speeds. It’s unclear if newer batches of the phone will all have the UFS chips, but for right now, either you got lucky and your phone has the latest chip, or you were unlucky and have to deal with the eMMC chips. Problem: Device doesn’t work after unlock After unlocking the Huawei P10 using the fingerprint sensor, the phone will occasionally cease to function correctly. The user can still swipe on the home screen, but cannot open apps, navigate menus, or even lock the phone. Instead, the screen can just be turned off. Temporary solution: Restarting the phone has been said to briefly fix the problem. After an unspecified amount of time, however, the problem will return. Potential solutions: Wipe the cache partition: Start by turning your phone off completely. Press and hold the Volume Up and Power keys until the Huawei logo appears and the screen turns black. Release the keys and “EMUI” should appear, meaning you’ve triggered the phone’s recovery system. Use the Volume Down key to highlight wipe cache partition and use the Power key to select it. Confirm your selection, and wait for your phone to finish the wiping process. Afterward, it should restart automatically. Factory reset: If you’re still able to navigate through your phone’s menus, go to Settings > Advanced settings > Backup & reset > Factory data reset > Reset phone. Be sure not to tap “Erase internal storage,” as this will wipe all of your music, photos, and videos. If you wish to back up your data before the reset, go to Backup > Internal storage > Next. Then, choose what you want to save and tap Back up. You can also connect your phone to your PC using a USB cable, if you want to back up your data. If you’re unable to navigate the menus, Huawei has a program for the PC called HiSuite, which can be used to back up your phone, restore your data, update the firmware, and even factory reset it. Boot phone into Safe Mode, as a third-party app could be causing the issue: To boot into Safe Mode, start by turning your phone off. Press and hold the Power key. When the Huawei logo appears, release the Power key, then hold down the Volume Down key. If done correctly, you should see “Safe Mode“ on the screen. If your phone can be unlocked and functions normally, it’s possible that a third-party app is the cause of the malfunction. Delete other third-party apps one by one until you discover the culprit. Contact Huawei Support. Annoyance: Device asks for PIN/password instead of fingerprint Threads on the XDA Developers and Android Central forums have people asking about a scenario in which the Huawei P10 asks its user to unlock the device using a method other than the fingerprint sensor. According to both threads, every three days the device will require a PIN or password to unlock, instead of the set fingerprints. Official solution: This is a feature built into the EMUI software running on Huawei phones, and is meant to act as a security measure. The user manual for the P10 even states that you can only use a fingerprint to unlock the phone “when the unlock method is set to PIN or password.” So, while PIN or password security is always on, you’re just being allowed to use the fingerprint sensor for a time. Should you ever restart your device, or the fingerprint scan fails, you’ll always have the PIN or password as a backup. For now, however, there doesn’t seem to be a way to extend how long you can go without using the PIN or password. B. Diddy, an Android Central forum user, notes that this requirement also happens on Nexus phones, so it’s not something exclusive to Huawei. Issue: Volume unusually loud for app notifications, alarms, and media A handful of people on the XDA Developers forums have all run into the same issue involving their P10 and P10 Plus’ volume levels. Users are able to adjust the volume for the phone’s ringer as intended, but are unable to control how loud sounds are for other aspects of the device, such as app notifications, alarms, video calls from apps like WhatsApp, and more. For some, sounds still play, even when they’re supposed to be muted, or when the phone is in Silent Mode (Settings > Sound > Silent Mode). Potential workaround: If sounds — other than those tied to your phone’s ringer — are too loud, simply turning them off via the “Do not disturb” feature may provide some peace and quiet. Enable and configure the feature in Settings > Do not disturb, and toggle Do not disturb on. Afterward, tap Do not disturb mode and you can configure settings for incoming calls and messages, and adjust which alarms are allowed to play when this mode is enabled. Potential solutions: A future update issued by Huawei for EMUI may fix this issue, or perhaps a future Android update. Restart your phone and head to Settings > Sound > Volume to adjust your phone’s system volume. Here, you’ll find volume sliders for alarms, ringtones, media, and calls. Reset your phone to its initial factory settings and see if you can adjust the various volumes to your liking. Reach out to Huawei support. Glitch: Fingerprint sensor not working For one reason or another, some Huawei P10 owners have found they’re suddenly unable to use the fingerprint sensor, and the option found within the phone’s menus is gone as well. It’s unclear what causes the issue, and whether Huawei is aware of this problem, which seems to be afflicting a small number of people. Temporary solution: A factory reset has been said to bring sensor functionality back. Potential solutions: Restart your  phone and try the fingerprint sensor again. Boot your phone into Safe Mode and see if the problem persists. If not, a third-party app may be causing the issue, and you may have to find and delete the app to resolve it. To boot into Safe Mode, start by turning your phone off. Press and hold the Power key. When the Huawei logo appears, release the Power key, then hold down the Volume Down key. If done correctly, you should see “Safe Mode” on the screen. Reach out to Huawei Support to ask about a replacement phone, or to have your phone repaired, as your fingerprint sensor may be faulty.

Google officials testified in federal court on Friday that it would have to spend up to 500 hours of work and $100,000 to comply with investigators’ ongoing demands for wage data that the DoL believes will help explain why the technology corporation appears to be systematically discriminating against women. Noting Google’s nearly $28bn annual income as one of the most profitable companies in the US, DoL attorney Ian Eliasoph scoffed at the company’s defense, saying, “Google would be able to absorb the cost as easy as a dry kitchen sponge could absorb a single drop of water.” Read the full story › Share on Facebook Share on Twitter ShareEmail  Print Note: Read our discussion guidelines before commenting.

Personal tab added to Google Search for individualized results from Google services Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/27 10:13am PDTMay 27, 2017 10 Plus 1 on G+ 29 Share on Facebook 45 Share on Twitter Total Shares84 Google News Google has just added a new Personal tab for results to search. Now if you toss in a term that might not otherwise trigger the personalized search results feature, you can manually move over to the Personal tab and make sure that compatible results appear. Results there can be easily limited to the content of your Google account across the company's various services. Searching for calendar appointments or emails just got a little bit easier. If you don't see the tab on a given search, it should appear under the More button. To smooth over any paranoia it provides the same message that personalized results did previously, only you are able to see the results displayed in the Personal tab. The change is live on desktop and mobile, though on your phone it is a bit harder to find. You have to scroll over quite a bit to get to it. I was able to pull up a good variety of personalized results from both, including emails, calendar appointments, and images in Google Photos. Searching for content from other Google services like Keep or Drive, unfortunately, didn't work. But, perhaps support will be expanded in the future.

Cepeda &#x2022; San Diego Union-Tribune Webpass technician Adam Larnach installed an upgraded millimeter wave radio atop a high rise condo unit in San Diego. Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on: Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink: Purchase: Order Reprint Cord cutting has taken a bite out of the number of pay-TV subscribers for cable and telecommunications companies. But it hasn't significantly reduced high-speed internet subscriptions — in part because there aren't many alternatives for over-the-top streamers. Webpass, now owned by Google, wants to be that alternative — even though today it's a niche internet service provider with a small footprint that is limited to apartments, condos and a handful of commercial buildings. The San Francisco company is trying to elbow its way into the broadband business where others — including Google Fiber and Verizon FiOS — have had mixed results luring away customers from established cable and telephone company providers. But unlike these wireline, fiber optic deployments, Webpass delivers broadband wirelessly. Founded in 2003, the company uses a daisy chain of point-to-point wireless radios on the rooftops of apartment and condo buildings to serve up bandwidth. It also can tap into fiber optic lines coming into the building from the street. From there, Webpass taps copper ethernet cabling behind the walls to deliver speeds ranging from 100 megabits per second to a 1 gigabit per second to customers. The cost is $60 a month. "Regardless of what speeds you're getting, it is the same price because we are giving you the fastest speeds your building will accommodate," said Charles Barr, founder and president of Webpass. Webpass operates in more than 800 multitenant buildings in San Francisco, Oakland, Calif., Miami, Denver, Boston, Chicago and San Diego. It serves even more buildings nationwide. Webpass eventually wants to expand its service not only to additional cities but also to single-family homes, Barr said. But regulations need to change and technology needs to advance before that will be possible. "I would love to serve single-family homes," he said. "It's a matter of technology and business processes that have to come together for us to be able to do it. But we are very focused on it."

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Our Report covers Major Patent Troller Uniloc Filing 3 Lawsuits against Apple and a Video taking a Peek at the 'Patent Scam' Industry | Main May 27, 2017 Major Tech & Industrial Companies Race to Acquire AI Startups as the AI Revolution Draws Nigh   It was just yesterday that we posted a report titled "Apple's advances in AI Continue to Surface at a Record Pace as news of a 'Neural Engine' Chip now Emerges." Two weeks ago we posted a report titled "AI Wars are almost reaching Fever Pitch with new Home Devices and Apple Fans look to WWDC 2017 for Apple's Response." One of Reuters latest reports makes the same point about the activity surrounding AI in the tech sector.   A new Reuters report quotes a statement by research firm CB Insights about the AI frenzy: "A total of 34 artificial intelligence startups were acquired in the first quarter of this year, more than twice the amount of activity in the year-ago quarter. Tech giants seeking to reinforce their leads in artificial intelligence or make up for lost ground have been the most aggressive buyers. Alphabet Inc's Google has acquired 11 AI startups since 2012, the most of any firm, followed by Apple, Facebook and Intel respectively."   The companies noted in the report declined to comment on their acquisition strategies. A spokesman for Apple did confirm the company's recent purchase of Lattice Data, a startup that specializes in working with unstructured data.   Apple is focused mainly on the retail/consumer sector while AI is ripping through all sectors of technology. Nvidia's Tesla P100 AI GPU was just adopted by IBM who see's this GPU as a game changer for the AI revolution.   Intel is going full tilt into into AI and made one of their largest acquisitions ever to gain Israel's Mobileye for autonomous vehicles. And the Reuters report today points to Ford Motor spending a billion dollars on Argo AI, founded by former executives on self-driving teams ag Google and Uber Technologies.   Large acquisitions aside, Apple never talks about their plans or projects. We know for a fact that they have a Project Titan team resides in Ottawa Canada in an industrial park that houses a research team from BlackBerry developing an autonomous vehicle OS and Apple is hiring as many of BlackBerry engineers that they can for their carOS efforts. You can't be developing an carOS for autonomous vehicles without a connection to AI. So while we don't know at what stage Apple is at, it's assured that one of their AI projects is related to Project Titan. One of their major AI acquisitions was Vocal IQ, a company that had a major focus on a digital assistant designed for the autonomous car.   I remember the unveiling of Apple's iPhone in 2007 which set off the mobile revolution which was an amazing time to see unfold. The AI revolution is not yet here. All we see is the preparation for the AI revolution, but for now it's just tiny baby steps coming to market in the form of Home devices and elementary digital assistants.   So many industries are banking on the coming 5G networks to help ignite the revolution and that's only three years away. So time will tell if that's when the starting gun for the AI Revolution truly fires.Yet whenever it does, we'll get to behold one of the most interesting times in history unfold. The AI revolution will of course dwarf the mobile revolution in shear scope covering every major market sector from the consumer, to the enterprise, to vehicles, to home automation, robotics and far beyond. It's a wonderful time to be alive.  For more on this, read the new Reuters report titled "Acquisitions accelerate as tech giants seek to build AI smarts."   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

The Android app for ASUS' upcoming Lyra mesh Wi-Fi network system is already available Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/26 5:11pm PDTMay 26, 2017 8 Plus 1 on G+ 30 Share on Facebook 53 Share on Twitter Total Shares91 Applications ASUS News Everyone's getting into the mesh Wi-Fi business these days. Google Wifi was released last year, Samsung is working on a mesh router, and a handful of other products from Netgear, Linksys, Ubiquiti, and others are on the market. Now ASUS is preparing to launch its own mesh network system, called 'Lyra,' and the Android control application is already live on the Play Store. The short product page for the Lyra doesn't reveal too many technical details, but the feature set sounds similar to the Google Wifi. You can view and control each family members' internet connection, track network usage, change prioritization, and so on. Creating a separate guest Wi-Fi network will also be supported, as well as more technical router functions like port forwarding and IP binding.    You can't really do anything with the app right now, given that Lyra isn't actually out yet, but it does give a peek into how the system will operate. The app will be compatible with the ASUS Lyra (MAP-AC2200) and Lyra-mini (MAP-AC1300), whenever they are released. Download QR-Code ASUS Lyra Developer: ASUSTeK Computer inc.

But it's better than repeaters and having tons of the same SSIDs! Needs to work with Fios though. And I'm not adding a new Mesh Network Router AND buying a network switch. If I buy any N Switch the N stands for Nintendo. epsiblivion none of these are startups: Google, Asus, Netgear, Linksys, Ubiquiti, Samsung Grey I'm not dumb. But they are new product lines and new products and I'm not getting in on the ground floor. dizel123 Sounds like you wouldn't really like to get a mesh network then. Grey This is a stupid statement. dizel123 Yes, your comment is a stupid statement, but all of your comments have been. Keep up the good work.

Aaron "Creating a separate guest Wi-Fi network will also be supported..." Yeah, Asus can't even get that working on my AC1750 router that they've sold for years. Pass. Christopher Bement Working on mine just fine. Aaron Can't get mine to show an SSID or let me log in to it. And over the last couple weeks I've been seeing a random issue where WiFi just drops out. I've been doing a hard reboot on the router to get my WiFi back. Nick Mrak D-Link had they feature out of the box with the 860L ac1200 ctk4949 I hope its compatible with my ASUS AC88U :) Mace Moneta I'll wait until either they ship OpenWRT based firmware, or OpenWRT supports installation and mesh functionality on one of the existing brands. I'm not going to be throwing away my router every few years when these guys decide to stop supporting them. Which bring me to the question all mesh router reviewers should be asking: how long will they be providing updates? Updates pushed by the manufacturers is a major feature; but it's not defined. 2 years? 5 years? 10 years? For a router, 10 years is a reasonable life (especially those that can easily run OpenWRT).

Google Play promo codes are now available in 8 more countries Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/05/26 7:05am PDTMay 26, 2017 11 Plus 1 on G+ 80 Share on Facebook 40 Share on Twitter Total Shares131 Apps/Games Development News If a developer wants to give some paid content away, usually the best way for them to do this is with a Google Play promo code. This has always been dependent on where you live, as they're supported in some regions but not others. Now, Google has added 8 further countries to the list of those that support the codes. They are as follows: Belgium, Finland, Greece, Ireland, Netherlands, New Zealand, Portugal, and South Africa. Play Store promo codes can be used to purchase content or add funds to your credit balance. They are a handy tool for developers who want to gift IAPs or whole apps to certain users without having to alter their pricing structure. With the new ones added, here's the full list of countries able to make use of promo codes: Austria Belgium Brazil Canada Denmark Finland Greece Hong Kong Ireland Italy Japan Mexico Netherlands New Zealand Norway Poland Portugal Singapore South Africa South Korea Sweden Switzerland Turkey United Kingdom United States Source: Google Play Help Tags developers Google google play promo codes subscribe ...

I don't know why my country isn't listed by Google. Kristian Ivanov Wait, when did that happen? O_o yo_asakura I don't know but there's a section Radeem in Google Play app, and I have used it before. Also I see other people from other countries comment that they have the option and still their country isn't listed. Apparently this list is not correct. Rita El Khoury Do you mean redeem promo codes or issue them as a dev? yo_asakura Both Tomáš Petrík If you buy a coupon in one of the supported countries and then travel back to your home country where it is not officially supported (and to where your Google account is being financially tied), will you be able to use the code? Giampi Probably not like you can't use the recharge cards purchased on a street country then yours Mohammad Ovais Promo codes are available in India too. Rita El Khoury You mean redeeming them or issuing them as a dev? Mohammad Ovais I am not a dev so I don't know if you could issue them, but I could definately redeem them. Taylor Hardy I do the job from comfort of my place, via doing quick activities which only demands from you a Home computer and even connection to the internet and I am also pleased than ever before... After six months in this project and also i got paid out in total 36 thousand dollars... Normally I earn roughly eighty bucks/hour and work for three to four hours every single day.And overwhelming point about this task is the fact that you can organize your time whenever you work and for how much time as you like and you earn a check weekly........ learn by clicking here how to do it right now Ailín Ó’S I live in Ireland and I've been able to use this for well over a year now, it is definitely not new at all. Rita El Khoury The support page was *just* updated to add Ireland. We keep an eye on that page as there's no other way for us to know when exactly a feature is added in a country, short of us living in every country on earth and keeping an eye on every feature - this is why we actually accept tips from readers, they help us with that. As a side effect of relying on the support pages, we have to wait for Google to say something is changing in a country. Sometimes that's way after a feature is live, sometimes it's before. /shrug Though, now that I'm thinking about it, I can use promo codes in Lebanon too... so that list of countries, maybe it's about where devs can ISSUE them and not where users can redeem them. The support page isn't very clear on that. To be investigated. So do you mean you can redeem promo codes or you can issue them as a dev in Ireland? Ailín Ó’S Hmmm, that's odd. Cheers for the clarification Rita :) DopeJam Bosnia and Herzegovina here. I have the option to redeem codes for very long time now. xyz Another unnecessarily geo-restricted feature from Google.

Andy Rubin's Android startup 'Essential' has a Twitter account, will announce new phone on May 30th Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/05/25 2:13pm PDTMay 25, 2017 27 Plus 1 on G+ 106 Share on Facebook 59 Share on Twitter Total Shares192 News Once upon a time, Andy Rubin created Android. Then one day, Google bought Android and let Andy play with robots for a few years. Now, Rubin is at the helm of a mysterious startup called Essential. He teased the company's bezel-less phone back in March, and now it's going to be revealed in just a few days. There's also a new Twitter account for Essential with more teasing. Hi, welcome to our Twitter page. We're here to let you know something big is coming May 30th! Stay tuned... — Essential (@essential) May 25, 2017 The big day is May 30th, which is this coming Tuesday. All we can say for sure is that the phone will have very narrow bezels. Well, the top right part of the phone will have a narrow bezel. That's the only part we've seen. The new Essential Twitter account also tweeted a weird silhouette of the phone today—it has a hump. We heard you @renan_batista - here's something to hold you over until next week: pic.twitter.com/QSIeXyjKNq — Essential (@essential) May 25, 2017 So, it will definitely be phone-shaped overall, but there's something attached to it up there at the top. A previous rumor claimed there would be a hardware accessory connector on the device. So, perhaps this is some sort of external sensor or camera plugged into said connector. I guess we'll find out on Tuesday. Tags andy rubin essential subscribe ... Previous Story Lyft introduces new Lyft Lux and Lyft Lux SUV black car service ...

I'm preordering right now! teh Jax Andy posted a photo of somebody working on a 360-degree camera. Additionally, if you lighten the new photo up a bit, you can tell that the addon is a bit spherical-shaped. Pretty much definitely a 360-degree camera. https://twitter.com/Arubin/status/852198868255199232 Phoenix I agree chandrizzle Additionally, from that lightened photo there looks to be a LG G5-style bezel at the bottom of the device teh Jax I initially thought so too but I came to the conclusion that while you can definitely tell the spherical nature of the camera add-on, the effect on the bottom bezel could easily just be light tricking us.

Need to use the camera? Just pop it out! Need privacy? Put it back in. teh Jax I have a version where I over-exaggerated the lightening and upped the contrast. It looks like crap but it pulls attention to a couple more potential pieces of details, like the bottom bezel that @chandrizzle:disqus was referring to. You can see it in yours, although just barely. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/e9ba98c881bf1fddf82f1f61cedf85a9eaa381c7d2466ed0311e090d60ea9b24.jpg PVL_93_RU a Camera attachment? cadtek91 Power and Volume are on the same side, why? Good_Ole_Pinocchio Because that's how it should be. Right handers with thumbs. Cael TELL HIM! DragoCubed T.T I like power being on the right and volume on the left. m477 Power on top is ok only on sub 4 inch devices. Good_Ole_Pinocchio That's that awkward Samsung set up people seem to be used to. But it's awkward Ian Santopietro Not really. You get Volume with your index/middle finger and power with the thumb. Lets you take screenshots one-handed. IMO, the biggest negative thing with my 5X vs the N5 someone755 Or you hold the phone as you normally would and don't need to reposition the entire planet to change the volume. That's how it is on my Xperia, my old Nokia, my mom's Xperia, her old Nokia, her old old Nokia, my sister's Xperia, my dad's Sony Ericsson, everyone's HTC etc. I just find it more comfortable I guess. If I'm tapping around the screen with my thumb and using it for the power button, all while supporting the phone with my index and middle finger so that it sits in the palm, it only makes sense that the two extra volume buttons don't impose their own regime on me. DragoCubed Awkward. Uh huh... My name is…. Yes, how else can you mistake Vol down with Power button? cadtek91 I am right handed. With them on opposite sides, screenshots only take one hand. Plus, I don't adjust volume that much. Azurael Specifically, the power button should be above the volume control to meet my exact preferences 🤣 I didn't mind them on the back like my old G2/G3 either. I very rarely use the power button on my 6P anyway. I wake it with the FP sensor and I have Lineage installed and tend to turn the screen off with a status bar double tap. I have my volume keys set to adjust media volume too, I've never quite gelled with Android's default volume control behaviour. Ring volume is either full or off for me. Ignore my long rambling senten Yu sylvain I thought the same Then I looked at my nexus 6 and realised they were also on the right, for 2 years i didn't even notice that lol not a big deal imo Good_Ole_Pinocchio From the linked Corbin article - Proprietary you say Andy? "But having no bezels likely won't be the phone's only trick. A proprietary connector that allows for charging the device and attaching hardware accessories, similar to Motorola's Moto Mods, is also in development. The report claims that one add-on will be a sphere-shaped camera capable of capturing 360-degree photos." vzwuser76 Where I see this working better than Lenovo's Moto Mods is that these add-ons don't appear to be a full back that snaps on like Moto's do. Doing it Moto's way means that their follow-up devices will need to have the same physical footprint for previously purchased Mods to work. But with Essential's design, follow-up devices won't be committed to the same footprint or design, it only needs the smart connector to be in the same position for add-on mounting. dogerRodger Is there really a market for phone hardware accessories? I could see a standalone item that is controlled via Bluetooth and an app. Not something that has to connect in a special way to a single device. Mel Torme Verizon exclusive? lomsha Hope not Mel Torme /s lomsha You never know lol Ryuuie Still probably won't work on Project Fi. Ugh. Daniel In order to work with Project Fi, a phone needs to have a GSM radio, a CDMA radio, and some other tech created by Google that switches between radios. And you probably have to license that tech created by Google. And all this costs extra money which is why you haven't seen companies like Samsung and LG make phones that work on project Fi. Gjorgi Lazarovski IIRC the Moto X Pure worked on Fi just fine and Motorola didn't even boast about it, so I don't think it's that difficult to have a Fi compatible device. Probably some preinstalled Google software and that's it. Daniel I'm pretty sure that phone was released when Motorola was still owned by Google. And every phone since the Nexus 6 has had those radios Daniel Marcus Pretty much any unlocked phone will work on Fi, as long as you're OK with it "only" using T-Mobile's network. In other words, you won't get all the fancy wifi-call-switching-magic, but you'll get solid service at Fi prices. Daniel Actually, that isn't true. Project Fi is has to switch between Sprint, T-Mobile, and U.S cellular's towers (I remember hearing AT&T, but I'm not sure if it's true). Project Fi will give you mobile data if you pop your SIM chip into your phone though. NeilR Plot twist: It was actually a teaser for the jeans Andy was wearing. The brand new Essential Jeans with XL pockets for your XL phones. Zorak✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵉᵛᶦˡ I buy one..as long as it can adequately accommodate all my XLs 😎 John Doe Andy Rubin also worked at Apple then created Danger which created the sidekick for T-Mobile (one of the first smartphones, it even had an app store) then he made Android and Google bought it and turned it upside down to make it compete with the iPhone. I believe he has a degree in robotics so that is why he wants to work on robots. Probably the only thing I dislike about him is that he is from Chappaqua, New York Lmao So this is his THIRD smartphone to make and TWO maybe three mobile operating systems and he got the title "big, arrogant fuck" bestowed upon him by Steve Jobs :) vzwuser76 Steve Jobs calling someone a big, arrogant fuck. That's the definition of pot calling the kettle black. theProffer But coming from Jobs, could also be seen as a compliment... lol David Stock Android? Benjamin Lehto All for the modest price of $_____? Ozl 1 bitcoin StockAndroid Essential should have gone the Samsung galaxy s8 way in terms of top bezel. Minimal black bezel but enough to house the sensors, camera and speaker. Otherwise good to know there is no gimmicky curved display. ThePublisher It's a flip out magnifying glass, like on a Swiss army knife. Definitely a magnifying glass...

Gadget Hacks Android WonderHowTo Gadget Hacks Next Reality Invisiverse Driverless Null Byte Android Basics Glossary of Terms Galaxy S8 Info HTC 11 Rumors Everything Pixel Rooting Guide Gaming Roundups Forum Stay Secure How-Tos News Not Hotdog: Try the Silicon Valley SeeFood App on Android By Dallas Thomas Fri 1:20 PM Gadget Hacks Not Hotdog: Try the Silicon Valley SeeFood App on Android If you're a tech enthusiast, there's no way you're not watching HBO's Silicon Valley. So you surely know the Pied Piper crew's latest shenanigans involve an app that uses a phone's camera to find facts about food items — a sort of Shazaam for food, if you may. What originally started out as Jian Yang's eight favorite recipes for octopus has now become a meme, to the point where HBO even decided to release the app in the real world. But even though the characters are clearly testing the app using a Google Pixel in the show, HBO has only made the app available for iPhone users. Since we all know the tech geeks of Silicon Valley would be using Android if they were real people, developer Aniruddh Chandratre stepped in to make things right. His new app is unofficial, but it captures the actual spirit of Jian Yang's app by using your phone's camera to determine what category a food item falls into. Try 'SeeFood' on Android Chandratre's app is called SeeFood just like the one in the show. The name kind of makes you worry about lawsuits from HBO considering it's unofficial, but the dev is just a college student, so we certainly hope HBO's not feeling litigious. At any rate, you can try it out by downloading SeeFood straight from the Play Store. Download SeeFood for Android from the Google Play Store After that, just open the app and grant the permissions it asks for (they're all reasonable things like "Camera" and "Storage"), then you'll be ready to try it out. It's really simple, too — just tap the blue floating action button in the bottom of your screen to open the camera, then snap a quick pic of some food and press "Use Stillshot." The app will process your image, though it might be a little slow at times since Chandratre is running the food-identifying algorithm on his personal server for now. Once it's done, though, the app will identify your food as being from one of 11 categories while providing information about what the algorithm found. Not hotdog! If the app identified your food correctly, make sure to tap the blue check mark near the top of the screen, because Chandratre certainly doesn't have a classroom full of Stanford students helping him identify foods. In the future, the developer hopes to offer more analysis about the food items his app sees, but for now, at least we've finally got a solid SeeFood app for Android!

The firm found a total of 41 apps from the same Korean company that contained the malware, as well as a few apps created by other entities that inexplicably had the malware in them. All of those apps have since been reported to Google and removed from Google Play, but at least one of the apps had last been updated in April of 2016, meaning that the bug has been lurking on the Play Store for over a year. The malware itself is named Judy because of the series of games that it’s hidden in. The malware itself is rather simple in its execution. It begins with a phone home to a control server from an app that a user downloads from the Play Store. The action doesn’t actually happen inside the app code that’s in the Play Store, which helps to get the apps past the Bouncer protections. Once the app phones home, the control server sends in a JavaScript payload that starts the actual malicious process. It controls the phone beneath the surface, directing it to URLs in the control server, where it seeks out ads from Google, then gives them repeated anonymous clicks to generate ad revenue for the attacker. The Korean company that put the Judy games on Google Play is known as Kiniwini, and is registered under the name ENISTUDIO corp. on Google Play’s developer listings. A cursory glance at the company’s website makes it seem like just another freemium mobile developer, with games on both iOS and Android. The otherwise unassuming Judy series checks all the normal mass-produced freemium game series boxes; fashion, animals, food, and the like, but contains malware that generates fradulent revenue by using an infected device without a user’s knowledge. The other apps that have the malware come from scattered developers, and most of the apps don’t even have English names, meaning that one would be hard-pressed to find them on most countries’ Play Stores. Along with the Judy series, the list of apps with English names includes Dog Music (Relax), Spring-It’s stylish, it’s sexy, and Crafting Guide for Minecraft. These apps don’t look malicious on the surface, and may even have millions of downloads and good reviews.

Many online platforms now offer two-step verification, making it harder for attackers to gain unauthorised account access. One form of two-factor authentication is a Universal 2nd Factor (U2F) security key, which is a physical key used to unlock your online accounts. Hardware In order to use a hardware key for authentication, you will need to ensure it complies with the open U2F standard from the FIDO Alliance. These keys are used to authenticate your account by connecting to your device using a USB connection or NFC. It is important to note that you can still access your account without a key, you will just need to use your previous form of authentication. FIDO U2F keys are available for below R500 for a device that supports both USB and NFC connectivity. You can use a FIDO-compliant key to unlock your account by inserting it into your PC’s USB port and pressing the button, or tapping it on an NFC reader. U2F keys are currently only supported by the latest versions of Opera and Google Chrome. The keys can also be used with smartphones, depending on their communications features. A brief explanation of how to set up FIDO U2F authentication on a number of popular platforms is detailed below. Google To add a security key to your Google account, navigate to Sign-In Settings under the My Account menu. Ensure your security key is not connected to your device and click Register, then insert your key into a USB port. If your security key has a button, press it and it should register as connected to your Google account. When logging into Google from Chrome or Opera, you will not be prompted to insert your security key after entering your login details. Facebook To set up your security key for Facebook, navigate to the Settings menu and select Security. In the Security menu, navigate to the Login Approvals page, which lists your current authentication methods and allows you to add new ones. Click the Add Key option and connect your security key to your device when prompted. Ensure that you have two-factor authentication enabled in your settings in order to activate the security key protection. Dropbox To activate your security key for Dropbox, navigate to the Security page under Settings and enable two-factor authentication. Before adding your security key, you will need to set up a backup authentication method, such as SMS or Google Authenticator. After this is done, you can add a security key by clicking on the appropriate option and following the prompts. GitHub GitHub’s two-factor authentication functions similarly to Dropbox, and will require you to set up a backup authentication method before adding a security key. In the Security menu, navigate to the two-factor authentication page and click the Register New Device option under Security Keys. After deciding on a nickname for your security key, follow the prompts to connect your key to your GitHub account.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Cars TECH Android Apple Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable MORE Entertainment Science Health Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Cars Tech   Android Apple Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable More   Entertainment Science Health Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search Google’s AlphaGo AI to retire after beating world’s best player Adam Westlake - May 27, 2017 0 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Earlier this week in China, AlphaGo, the artificial intelligence from Google‘s DeepMind division, defeated Ke Jie, the world’s number one Go player, in a three-part match. Now the company has revealed that the AI will be hanging up its gloves, so to speak. As the 3-0 win over Ke Jie marks “the highest possible pinnacle for AlphaGo as a competitive program,” DeepMind co-founder and co-CEO Demis Hassabis says the bot will be retiring from competitive play. This monumental achievement for the AI comes just over a year after AlphaGo beat South Korea’s Lee Se-dol, another of the game’s top players, 4-1 in a series of matches. This result was highly unexpected to computer scientists, as Go, an ancient Chinese board game, is seen as much more nuanced and complex than something like Chess, and it was believed human-level intuition would best the AI at the professional level. This week’s match was held at the Future of Go Summit in Wuzhen, hosted by both Google and the China Go Association as an event for professional players to come together with AI experts. AlphaGo’s win over Ke Jie not only proves that the AI can master the game’s complexity, but that it’s arguably now the world’s greatest player. Hassabis says that the research team behind AlphaGo will now devote their efforts into applying the AI to one day assist scientists with challenges like curing diseases and reducing energy consumption. “If AI systems prove they are able to unearth significant new knowledge and strategies in these domains too, the breakthroughs could be truly remarkable,” he added. DeepMind has no plans to release AlphaGo to the public, but it will soon publish a research paper on the latest version of the AI that beat Ke Jie, with Hassabis hoping that other companies and programs will be able to benefit from their research.

The shooting in the province of Minya on Friday, as the Coptic Christians were travelling on a bus to a monastery, was the latest in a series of attacks by IS that have killed more than 100 Copts since December. “A security detachment from the Islamic State carried out an attack yesterday in Minya,” the group’s self styled Amaq news agency reported. Egyptian fighter jets yesterday continued their air strikes on camps in Libya, which Cairo claimed had been training the militants who carried out the attack. President Abdel-Fattah el-Sisi said he had ordered strikes against what he called terrorist camps, declaring in a televised address that states that ­sponsored terrorism would be punished. Egyptian military sources said six strikes took place near Derna in eastern Libya, hours after masked gunmen attacked the Coptic Christians travelling to a monastery. “The terrorist incident that took place today will not pass unnoticed,” Sisi said. “We are currently targeting the camps where the ­terrorists are trained.” He said Egypt would not hesitate to carry out further strikes against camps that trained people to carry out operations against Egypt, whether those camps were inside or outside the country. Egyptian military footage of pilots being briefed and war planes taking off was shown on state television. East Libyan forces said they participated in the air strikes, which had targeted forces linked to al-Qaeda at a number of sites, and would be followed by a ground operation. A resident in Derna heard four powerful explosions, and said the strikes hit camps used by fighters belonging to the Majlis al-Shura militant group. The terrorist incident that took place today will not pass unnoticed. We are currently targeting the camps where the ­terrorists are trained President Abdel-Fattah el-Sisi Majlis al-Shura spokesman Mohamed al-Mansouri said in a video posted online that the Egyptian air strikes did not hit any of the group’s camps, but instead hit civilian areas. At a village near Minya, thousands attended a ­funeral service that turned into an angry protest against the authorities’ failure to protect Christians. “We will avenge them or die like them,” mourners said, while marching with a giant wooden cross. Witnesses said masked men opened fire after stopping the Christians, who were in a bus and other vehicles on a desert road. ­Local TV channels showed a bus apparently covered in bullet holes and smeared with blood. Clothes and shoes could be seen lying in and around the bus, while the bodies of some of the ­victims lay in the sand nearby, covered with black sheets. According to witnesses, three vehicles were attacked. First hit was a vehicle taking children to the monastery as part of a church outing. The gunmen boarded the vehicles and shot all the men and took all the women’s gold jewellery. They then shot women and children in the legs. When one of the gunmen’s vehicles got a flat tyre they stopped a truck carrying Christian workers, shot them, and took the truck. One of the gunmen recorded the attack on the Copts using a video camera, some witnesses said. US President Donald Trump said his country stood with Sisi and the Egyptian people: “This merciless slaughter of Christians in Egypt tears at our hearts and grieves our souls.” Pope Francis, who visited Cairo a month ago, described the attack as a “senseless act of hatred”.

The Android app for ASUS' upcoming Lyra mesh Wi-Fi network system is already available Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/26 5:11pm PDTMay 26, 2017 8 Plus 1 on G+ 30 Share on Facebook 53 Share on Twitter Total Shares91 Applications ASUS News Everyone's getting into the mesh Wi-Fi business these days. Google Wifi was released last year, Samsung is working on a mesh router, and a handful of other products from Netgear, Linksys, Ubiquiti, and others are on the market. Now ASUS is preparing to launch its own mesh network system, called 'Lyra,' and the Android control application is already live on the Play Store. The short product page for the Lyra doesn't reveal too many technical details, but the feature set sounds similar to the Google Wifi. You can view and control each family members' internet connection, track network usage, change prioritization, and so on. Creating a separate guest Wi-Fi network will also be supported, as well as more technical router functions like port forwarding and IP binding.    You can't really do anything with the app right now, given that Lyra isn't actually out yet, but it does give a peek into how the system will operate. The app will be compatible with the ASUS Lyra (MAP-AC2200) and Lyra-mini (MAP-AC1300), whenever they are released. Download QR-Code ASUS Lyra Developer: ASUSTeK Computer inc.

Aaron "Creating a separate guest Wi-Fi network will also be supported..." Yeah, Asus can't even get that working on my AC1750 router that they've sold for years. Pass. Christopher Bement Working on mine just fine. Aaron Can't get mine to show an SSID or let me log in to it. And over the last couple weeks I've been seeing a random issue where WiFi just drops out. I've been doing a hard reboot on the router to get my WiFi back. Nick Mrak D-Link had they feature out of the box with the 860L ac1200 ctk4949 I hope its compatible with my ASUS AC88U :) Mace Moneta I'll wait until either they ship OpenWRT based firmware, or OpenWRT supports installation and mesh functionality on one of the existing brands. I'm not going to be throwing away my router every few years when these guys decide to stop supporting them. Which bring me to the question all mesh router reviewers should be asking: how long will they be providing updates? Updates pushed by the manufacturers is a major feature; but it's not defined. 2 years? 5 years? 10 years? For a router, 10 years is a reasonable life (especially those that can easily run OpenWRT).

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Mellow is a Bluetooth speaker, powerbank, and table in one By Rei Padla - May 27, 2017 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter A smart home will not be complete without those smart speakers. We only know Google Home and the Amazon Echo products as the more popular ones but their voice assistant systems are already integrated with a lot of the devices. The smart home industry will only expand in the coming years as more companies and OEMs have started to consider the technology. Starting with Bluetooth speakers, the start home has slowly transformed into smarter versions that can talk back to you, provide information, and do some simple tasks for you. There are many models to choose from already and most of them come in the form of Bluetooth speakers. When you see them inside a home, you would know them immediately. Most of them come in boring, black design but good thing there are those people who’ve been trying to produce more attractive and useful versions like this Mellow. Mellow is a new Kickstarter project. It’s a Bluetooth speaker that comes in the form of a table. It’s a table and speaker in one that offers clear audio in your living room, bedroom, or the patio. It’s also a side table that you can position anywhere to complete the look of the room and at the same time, work as a Bluetooth-connected speaker. The Mellow speaker can last up to seven hours of music playback within a 10-meter range. Specs include a 6600mAh batter, two USB ports so you can charge multiple devices, and playback buttons on the side. It looks stylish with its modern design—something that we know interior designers will consider. The Bluetooth speaker-table is designed by Creatio while the audio technology is by Blueman. The project is now on Kickstarter with a $15,000 fund goal. With only five days to go before deadline, Team Creatio already raised about $55,000. Feel free to support this project by making a pledge and sending your support.

Previously available to Pixel phones, Google Assistant lets users talk to his phone in a conversational way, providing answers to questions about weather, flight information and appointments. Yes, it’s like Apple’s Siri. LG was one of the first smartphone makers to reveal it would feature the assistant on its new device, the G6. In its blog post, the assistant will be rolled out this week in the US, while users in Canada, Australia, Germany and the UK will get the feature soon as well. “With this update, hundreds of millions of Android users will now be able to try out the Google Assistant,” Gummi Hafsteinsson, product lead for Google Assistant, said. To use this (if you have Nougat or Marshmallow operating system), just long press the Home button and say “Ok Google” to get started. And now, you can ask things such as ‘What’s my confirmation number for my London flight,’ ‘Take me to Museu Picasso,’ ‘Do I need an umbrella today,’ and many more. According to its blog, there is no need to download the update because Google Assistant will be usable on phones running Nougat and Marshmallow with Google Play Services. “Our goal is to make the Assistant available anywhere you need it. It came to Android Wear 2.0 – via new smartwatches – just a few weeks ago and, as we previewed in January, the Assistant is also coming to TVs and cars,” Hafsteinsson said.   Facebook Comments Website Comments free pron March 6th, 2017 Reply ab5Pn3 My brother suggested I might like this website.

Eliminating fears That is thus as the first-step generally deals with acknowledgement. It will take humility to tell the truth about these things, and getting rid of them becomes extra. You think about now on what you’re to get rid of the said concerns in your life as being a leader, and you also do this by being alert to the cases where these doubts overrule your thoughts and judgment as being a leader. Show patience with yourself if you learn yourself not able to beat your anxieties immediately. Hence, it sometimes becomes an effort and problem and perseverance is a great characteristic that you’re mastering while you cope with the anxieties. In working with your concerns, you’re increasing strength and intelligence like a boss. For you to carry on carrying out a superior occupation, you must also make time to reward oneself to be a better boss.

(Reuters/Stringer) Share Written by Selina Cheng Obsession Machines with Brains May 27, 2017 This is the face of desperation. Ke Jie, the world’s best human Go player, lost two games against a new version of Google’s AlphaGo on May 25. This means AlphaGo has already secured victory in the three-part match. The third game will take place Saturday (May 27), during the ongoing “Future of Go” summit in Wuzhen, China, where the game was born. The 19-year old Chinese player looked exasperated during his second match against Google’s artificial intelligence player. After 156 moves, Ke Jie was forced to give up. He had lost the first match by just a half point. “Last year, I think the way AlphaGo played was pretty close to human beings, but today I think he plays like the God of Go,” Ke said to a summit audience after the game, Reuters reports. He previously claimed that AlphaGo would not be able to beat him, but now, he believes “the future belongs to AI.” (Reuters/Stringer) Last year, AlphaGo beat South Korean Go master Lee Sedol in a five-game series by 4-1. Lee’s single victory showed that the artificial intelligence program was still fallible when countering unexpected moves. Google has since managed to take Ke by surprise: “There was a cut that quite shocked me, because it was a move that would never happen in a human-to-human Go match,” he said. Earlier this year, Google secretly let the improved AlphaGo play unofficially on an online Go platform. The AI won 50 out of 51 games, and its only loss was owed to an internet connection timeout.

Demis Hassabis, whose Google-owned artificial intelligence lab DeepMind built this historic machine, tells WIRED he will now move AlphaGo’s designers on to other projects. “These are some of the top people in the company,” says Hassabis. “The idea is to really explore what we can do in other domains.” Considering the world-shaking success of AlphaGo, those explorations promise some very powerful possibilities. Related Video Google’s AlphaGo Notches Another Win for AI Last March in Seoul, South Korea, AlphaGo became the first machine to beat a top player at the ancient game of Go when it defeated Korean grandmaster Lee Sedol—a feat that most researchers didn’t consider possible just a few years before. In the year since, Hassabis and his team significantly improved the machine. Today, in Wuzhen, China, AlphaGo won its third game against Ke Jie, and much as in the other two, the contest held little drama, even as the machine’s peerless play sent the usual ripples across the worldwide Go community. When DeepMind first unveiled AlphaGo, serious students of the game questioned whether it was skillful enough to challenge the world’s best players. When it topped Lee Sedol, many lamented that a machine had eclipsed the powers of humanity, somehow mimicking the intuition required to play this enormously complex game. But as the DeepMind team continued to improve this surprisingly powerful system, the top Go players couldn’t get enough of its unique and sometimes transcendent style of play. They’ve repeatedly called on DeepMind to release the countless games that AlphaGo has played behind closed doors, seeing the machine as a window into the future of Go.

Today, during the press conference following the game, Hassabis and DeepMind announced they will publicly release 50 games AlphaGo played against itself inside the vast data centers that underpin Google’s online empire. “Some of the great games in history may be played on these servers,” Hassabis says. Quite literally, AlphaGo learns to master the mysteries of Go by playing game after game against itself. Though it typically does this under strict time limits—seconds or milliseconds for each move—DeepMind has released games that played out over several hours, much like professional matches. “These are beautiful games, with moves no one has seen,” says Fan Hui, the European Go champion who helped train AlphaGo. But even as DeepMind made the announcement, some Go players complained that those 50 games were a mere pittance, considering that the machine has played hundreds of thousands of games against itself over the past several months, if not millions. They believe they have so much more to learn from the machine they once viewed with so much skepticism and fear. The evolution of AlphaGo is just one demonstration of the way artificial intelligence can not only replace human skills but advance them. So many of the top players have changed their play after watching AlphaGo, particularly since a new version of the machine won 60 online matches under an online pseudonym in January. This week in Wuzhen, Ke Jie opened the first game with the rather unusual strategy, “3-3 point,” that AlphaGo used time and again during those 60 matches. Related Video AlphaGo Wins First Go Game in China with New AI Architecture Hassabis and other researchers believe that AI will soon have a similar impact in the worlds of healthcare and scientific research, pushing humans to places they couldn’t travel on their own. And that’s no idle prediction. Underpinned by technologies that are already reinventing the world’s most popular internet services while rapidly pushing into driverless cars and robotics, AlphaGo is very much a proxy for the near future of AI as a whole. According to Hassabis and lead DeepMind researcher David Silver, the new incarnation of the machine is something the DeepMind team can apply to a myriad of tasks beyond the game of Go. After the match in China, DeepMind is disbanding the team that worked on the game, freeing top researchers like Silver and Thore Graepel to spend their time working on the rest of AI’s future.

AlphaGo defeated brash 19-year-old world number one Ke Jie of China on Saturday to sweep a three-game series that was closely watched as a measure of how far artificial intelligence (AI) has come. AlphaGo last year become the first computer programme to beat an elite player in a full Go match, and its successes have been hailed as groundbreaking due to the game's complexity. Go has an incomputable number of moves, putting a premium on human-like "intuition" and strategy. But this week's contests in the eastern Chinese city of Wuzhen were its last, said DeepMind Technologies, the London-based AI company that developed AlphaGo and which Google acquired in 2014. In a blog post, DeepMind founder Demis Hassabis said AlphaGo's developers will turn to "the next set of grand challenges, developing advanced general algorithms that could one day help scientists as they tackle some of our most complex problems". These could include "finding new cures for diseases, dramatically reducing energy consumption, or inventing revolutionary new materials," he said. "If AI systems prove they are able to unearth significant new knowledge and strategies in these domains too, the breakthroughs could be truly remarkable. We can´t wait to see what comes next." Go involves two players laying black and white stones on a grid, trying to capture the most territory. Invented nearly 3,000 years ago in China, it is played worldwide but most popular in East Asia. Top players have been mesmerised by AlphaGo, describing its play as groundbreaking and opening up new ways of approaching the game. Likewise, AlphaGo's feats have fuelled visions of AI that can not only perform pre-programmed tasks, but help humanity look at complex scientific, technical and medical mysteries in new ways. AlphaGo's "thinking" is powered by millions of connections similar to neurons in the brain. It is partly self-taught, having played millions of games against itself. This week's matches received considerable build-up in China, where it is popular. But Chinese authorities abruptly banned live coverage before the first match on Tuesday, prompting anger and scorn on Chinese social media. The ban was not explained, but quickly fueled speculation that it was linked to Google's tense history with Beijing. Google shut down its www.google.cn website in 2010 in a row over cyberattacks and Chinese censorship, and most of its offerings have remained blocked by authorities.

After beating Ke Jie, the world’s best player of the ancient Chinese board game Go, for the third time today at the Future of Go Summit in Wuzhen, Google’s DeepMind unit announced that it would be the last event match the AI plays. In a statement, DeepMind co-founder and co-CEO Demis Hassabis said the reason was that this week’s summit represented “the highest possible pinnacle for AlphaGo as a competitive program.” AlphaGo rose to prominence a little over a year ago when it unexpectedly defeated legendary player Lee Se-dol 4-1 in a match held in Seoul. Most computer scientists expected the feat of beating a top Go player with artificial intelligence to be decades away due to the game’s complexity and nuance, but with this week’s comprehensive defeat of Ke Jie the matter has been settled. “We can’t wait to see what comes next.” “The research team behind AlphaGo will now throw their considerable energy into the next set of grand challenges, developing advanced general algorithms that could one day help scientists as they tackle some of our most complex problems, such as finding new cures for diseases, dramatically reducing energy consumption, or inventing revolutionary new materials,” Hassabis says. “If AI systems prove they are able to unearth significant new knowledge and strategies in these domains too, the breakthroughs could be truly remarkable. We can’t wait to see what comes next.” AlphaGo’s success has brought profound change to the world of Go, most obviously seen this week in the way Ke Jie used previously unorthodox moves that the AI had employed itself and forced human players to reevaluate. And although AlphaGo has played its last competitive match, DeepMind will release the data from 50 games of the AI playing against itself for the Go community to study. DeepMind is also working on a teaching tool based on AlphaGo to be released sometime in the future. Ke Jie will collaborate with DeepMind on the tool, which Hassabis says should give “all players and fans the opportunity to see the game through the lens of AlphaGo.” Related Why Google's Go win is such a big deal “We have always believed in the potential for AI to help society discover new knowledge and benefit from it, and AlphaGo has given us an early glimpse that this may indeed be possible,” Hassabis says. “More than a competitor, AlphaGo has been a tool to inspire Go players to try new strategies and uncover new ideas in this 3,000 year-old game.” DeepMind doesn’t plan to give AlphaGo itself a wide release, however. Hassabis told The Verge earlier this week that while there were “complications” in doing so, he’s more than happy for others to make use of DeepMind’s research themselves. Programs like Tencent’s Fine Art and Japan’s DeepZenGo have used similar deep-learning techniques to achieve around 9th-dan level, according to Hassabis, which is the highest ranking a human can attain and represents a far stronger degree of play than the previous state of the art. DeepMind will soon publish another paper on how it architected the latest version of AlphaGo, AlphaGo Master, and Hassabis expects other companies to learn from the new research. AlphaGo has quite literally been a game-changer; now it’s up to humans to see how they can make use of it, and DeepMind to find out where it can go from here.

Photograph: Taylor Hill/FilmMagic Spotify The Observer Spotify hopes going public will cement streaming as music's future As music industry celebrates second straight year of growth, service hopes to buck trend of tech industry disappointments on Wall Street Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close Edward Helmore in New York Saturday 27 May 2017 06.00 EDT Last modified on Saturday 27 May 2017 17.00 EDT The world may love the services they provide, but the new generation of tech companies haven’t found much love on Wall Street recently. Spotify, the leading music streaming service, is hoping to change that with a share sale could lead another round of “unicorns” to try their luck on the US stock markets. Founded 11 years ago in Sweden by Daniel Ek, 34, Spotify currently has more than 100m monthly active users, of which 50m are paying subscribers. A successful debut for Spotify, valued at least $8.5bn, will officially crown streaming as the future of the music industry. The company’s closest rival, Apple Music, counts 20 million paying users; Tidal, fronted by the rap superstar Jay Z, a little over one million. Amazon and Google are also in the game, with Facebook a likely entrant. Music industry goes to war with YouTube Read more Ek, a serial entrepreneur who started his first company at age 14, owns a stake in Spotify valued at $1.8bn. But while he will leave this share sale a rich man, streaming will probably never make the sort of money for the music industry that CDs and vinyl did. Even so, after more than 15 years of disruption that kicked off with industry revenues eviscerated by illegal peer-to-peer file-sharing, the music business is currently celebrating its second straight year of growth. In 2016, streaming revenue increased 60%, while the overall global music industry grew 5.9% – the fastest rate of growth since 1997. According to a global music report issued by the industry group IFPI, music revenues hit $15.7bn in 2016, up from $14.8bn in 2015. Fifty per cent of that came from digital sales. A Goldman Sachs research note, Music in the Air, projects that streaming will help revenues double to $104bn by 2030. The industry’s begrudging acceptance of technology has proved its salvation. “This is the triumphant return of innovation,” says Les Borsai, music-tech entrepreneur behind the business-facing music platform SongLily. Instead of fighting consumer preferences, the labels “have come around to realizing that consumer demand for innovation drives the business”. “It’s not so long since we had to walk into Virgin Records to buy the physical product. Back then, we thought people would hate losing that experience. Download kills retail, but that becomes archaic. So we go to the streaming model that gives instant gratification, which is now the model for everything.” As recently as three years ago, artists were still sharing their doubts that music subscription services would ever be widely accepted. Taylor Swift pulled her music from Spotify in 2014. She later explained she was “not willing to contribute my life’s work to an experiment”. But significant hurdles remain. One is Google-owned YouTube, which dominates music streaming with a free, ad-supported model. While YouTube points to $1bn it paid back to the industry in advertising last year, payments to artists have not kept pace. Part of the issue, says Greg Barnes, general counsel of the Digital Media Association, is that copyright laws have lagged behind technology. “We want to make it easier to licence vast quantities of songs in an efficient manner. We need to make the system more efficient and more transparent.” While it may be hard to imagine a time when one hit single could sell 18m copies of a Twisted Sister album, today’s numbers are nonetheless impressive. Take the Canadian rapper Drake: last year, Spotify streamed his songs more than 4.7bn times. But music label executives also urge caution. They note that neither Spotify or its rivals have reported a profit. Cary Sherman, CEO of the music industry’s US trade group, noted in a blogpost that the improvement in revenues “does not erase 15 years of declines, or continuing uncertainty about the future”. Ek is listening. Last week, Spotify announced it had added four new board members, including the former Walt Disney chief operating officer Tom Staggs; Shishir Mehrotra, YouTube’s former head of product; Padmasree Warrior, who heads of the US unit of the Chinese electric auto firm NextEV; and Cristina Stenbeck of the Swedish investment firm Kinnevik. The appointment of Staggs, a 26-year veteran of Disney, was widely interpreted to signal that Spotify is looking to enter into the video-streaming market. The company previously added Netflix’s chief content officer, Ted Sarandos, to the board. It may not just be streaming that Spotify makes mainstream. The company is considering a direct listing on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), an unusual tactic that avoids millions in underwriting fees and could help attract other tech unicorns – companies valued at over $1bn – to follow suit. Tech companies have traditionally favoured an initial public offering (IPO) in which the company offers investors shares before it goes public. A direct listing only allows investors to buy shares through the open market. The move saves a fortune in fees but also – potentially – makes the sale highly volatile as long-term investors, like pension funds, who could have bought into the pre-sale of an IPO, will only decide whether to buy in once shares start trading. If approved, the Swedish streaming service could go public later this year, marking the first tech listing since the disappointing launch of Snap Inc, which lost $2bn in value after releasing disappointing results earlier this month. If the IPO is successful, other hot startups, such as Airbnb and Uber, could follow swiftly in Spotify’s wake.

According to a report in CNBC on Friday, the invitation-only summit is part of an initiative for advertisers called “Facebook Health”, run by a small team reporting into former Google Director Meredith Guerriero. The summit primarily focuses on gearing marketers in the pharmaceutical industry. “It is expected that Facebook Health may unveil tweaks to the ad product, so pharma companies can more easily plug themselves on the platform. It could focus on mobile video, as that’s been a major focus for the team,” the report quoted an anonymous source as saying. According to reports, Guerriero is hosting a session in late June with Carey Reynolds, a marketer with the drug maker Allergan, to discuss how pharma companies can form “stronger connections between patients” through Facebook. “Our source said that Google and Twitter hired large teams to work with pharmaceutical companies on ad campaigns, but Facebook hasn’t had a real seat at the table until the past year,” the report added. The pharmaceutical industry in the US works under strict regulations when it comes to promoting its drugs on social channels. A drug company might target a person who has “liked” an advocacy page, or fits a certain demographic profile. “But it would not be allowed to target ads to specific people based on a disease that Facebook knows or suspects they have,” the report added.
