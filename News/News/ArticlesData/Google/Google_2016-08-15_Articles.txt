Hugh White 10:41 AM ET Donald Trump's Conflicts of Interest: A Crib Sheet Jeremy Venook 7:00 AM ET Adrienne Green Aug 16, 2016 Business Share Tweet … LinkedIn Email Print Text Size When today’s tech employees were growing up, the most advanced technology in their households might have been a graphing calculator or a basic computer. Today, millions of people walk around with far more advanced devices in their pockets. Dave Chen, a senior manager on one of Google Play’s engineering teams, has been there to see that rapid change, and to be a part of it. For The Atlantic’s series of interviews with American workers, I spoke with Chen, who has worked in software engineering in Ohio, Maryland, and California, about how Silicon Valley differs from other tech hubs, the quickening pace of industry innovation, and his experience as an engineer. This interview has been lightly edited for context and clarity. Adrienne Green: What inspired you to start working in technology and engineering? Dave Chen: I grew up in Columbus, Ohio, and I always enjoyed programming and coding. In eighth grade, I was taking a geometry class and it required the use of a graphing calculator. We were lower-middle-class, but my parents got me one. It was really my first experience with coding; it was engaging and exciting to create something. I experimented with coding all the way through to college. I ended up being selected for the freshman engineering honors program at Ohio State, and we had to build a robot for our final capstone class. I worked on a team of four people, and we built an autonomous robot that ended up being very successful. During the first year of college, I had a few odd jobs: I worked at a grocery store as a bagger making minimum wage, and then at CompUSA, a computer store, as a cashier. In the summer after my freshman year, I was working at CompUSA again. The professor of my engineering class asked me, “Why are you working here?” He asked me to come work for him at his design center for a startup in Cupertino, California. I worked for him on a part-time and full-time basis for my remaining three years of college. That was my first real professional job being paid for coding. Green: How did you end up at Google? Chen: I got job offers from a couple of different companies after college: IBM and Lockheed Martin. I picked Lockheed Martin because it included a three-year, rotational program that allowed me to get my master's degree in computer science from John Hopkins. After four years at Lockheed, I came over to the Valley. When I got my job offer at Yahoo, I later found out that my hiring manager had a big stack of resumes, pulled one out, decided to interview that person and hire him or her—and that person happened to be me. I worked for Yahoo for two years. At the end of 2008, I interviewed at Google during the height of the financial crisis. After two years of working as a software engineer, I started managing others as an engineering manager at Google Play. Green: What exactly do you do as a software engineer? Chen: I'm an engineering manager at Google. On a day-to-day basis, my job revolves around both short- and long-term strategy for Google Play to build internal-testing tools. If we're successful, that means that the next feature we launch be faster than the past features that we launched. In tech, the goal is to move fast. “I often feel like people who have had minimum-wage jobs have a different sort of flavor.” Green: How is working in Silicon Valley different than working in Ohio or Maryland? Chen: In Ohio, I was technically working for a company in the Valley, but it had this Midwestern feel. In Silicon Valley, the pace is a quicker. Compared to Maryland, the value systems and pace, and drive for innovation might be a little bit different. I think Silicon Valley attracts this very interesting sort of person. Coming from the Midwest, I always tell people my first job was a minimum-wage job, and I often feel like people who have had minimum-wage jobs have a different sort of flavor. In the Valley, everywhere you look there are people pushing for crazy amounts of success. In Maryland, people look at a job as a job and are less concerned about career, whereas in Silicon Valley people are very concerned about their careers. The Valley can be very grounded, but it can also be this place of wild and crazy expectations where people push themselves because they want to be part of that next thing. I don't see that quite so much in Ohio and in Maryland. Green: How do you think working a minimum-wage job and then becoming an engineer has affected how you see work culture? Chen: I was a bagger at a grocery store and we pushed carts around. This was the 1990s and you still put pride in the job. At least I did. I worked with people everyday and their value system was very much focused around who you were outside of work. Who you are in the Midwest largely depends not on your job, but on your family, friends, and hobbies. There are really good opportunities in Ohio, but I think the opportunities in Silicon Valley—that dream of getting there and trying to make it—consumes some people a little bit more. Especially in tech, people are always chasing that next big thing. It can, in many cases, become “This is my purpose in life or my singular purpose.” There are lots of people that are very grounded in the San Francisco Bay Area, but there's always that looking over your shoulder, keeping up with the Joneses kind of feeling: You see those stories or the status symbols or the people. I think in Ohio, that may be looked upon as less of an ideal than it is here. Dave Chen working outside on Google’s campus Green: You talked about the fast pace of your current job a lot. Do you ever feel stressed because of that? Chen: I have friends who work at startups in Ohio, who experience that same sort of stress and fast pace. At Lockheed Martin, there was a strong focus on doing things the right way. When you're in a startup, you're basically looking to survive to the next month or the next quarter. When you look at all the internet companies, it's very easy to see how many have come and gone. Google, or any company, could very well be that next has-been. I think the pace is born out of innovation. We're trying to bring that same sort of development and discipline to software engineering that industries like manufacturing and architecture have achieved. Our job is to focus on how we improve software engineering and make it better, faster, easier for engineers to actually deliver amazing experiences to our users. We could look at it in terms of the competitive nature of Company A versus Company B. I think that's there, too, but for me it's more about, how can we make it so that the next coder in any part of the world can come along and say, “Wow, I have really, really amazing tools to help me create things that never existed before”? Green: What motivates you as an engineer? Chen: For me it's about making a difference. My foundational focus is around the people on my team. Am I doing a good job for them? Am I putting them in the best position to succeed? I went into management primarily because, from a people perspective, if I can help somebody grow and advance to the next thing, or open up more doors and opportunities, that's exciting for me. Secondly, Google Play is a really enormous platform for impacting people. It encompasses both apps on Android phones as well as digital content. If we can do a great job, and focus on the user, then I think we can do great things and that's where I find that motivation. Green: You just mentioned that opening doors for others is important to you, and the lack of diversity in the tech industry is widely known. What has your experience as an Asian American man in Silicon Valley been? Chen: In Ohio, Asian Americans are a minority in the workforce. I guess it’s less so in D.C. and in the Bay area. I think part of what drives me is the motivation to be inclusive. When I was in D.C., I never felt like it was ever a bad thing being a minority. One thing I really advocate for in my personal work is, how can I encourage minorities to get involved in STEM? This is how I got involved in the Society of Asian Scientists and Engineers. I was very passionate about seeing how I could help Asian Americans succeed in STEM fields. I wish that I had these stories, or the same opportunities to connect with somebody in the industry who had faced some of these challenges—someone who had learned what was important and how to navigate corporate America. If you look at the different companies I’ve worked at—a startup, Lockheed Martin, which has a more traditional corporate culture, and then Yahoo and Google—they’re actually significantly different culturally. Green: In Silicon Valley, it seems as though Asian Americans are the most highly represented minority. How has that affected the way you mentor other Asian American students? Chen: My parents had immigrated to the U.S. when I was three or four years old. Growing up in the Midwest, where I was  definitely a minority, I remember being bullied. It was challenging growing up as a minority. I'm really passionate about making sure that minorities from whatever background or gender can find a home and can be included and contribute ideas. If we're going to really build products and build a discipline around engineering and around software engineering that incorporates the best of all ideas, we need everybody. Efforts around diversity and inclusion and unconscious bias are critical to the success of not just people in tech but people in industries worldwide. The volunteering is a big part of giving back. I think I’ve been very lucky in my career. Tech exploded, and it was my interest area. So I was lucky to have been part of that. This interview is a part of a series about the lives and experiences of members of the American workforce, which includes conversations with a voice of OnStar, a cartographer, and a medical illustrator.

Spencer saluted more than 200 attendees on Saturday, gathered at the Ronald Reagan Building in Washington, D.C., for the annual conference of the National Policy Institute, which describes itself as “an independent organization dedicated to the heritage, identity, and future of  people of European descent in the United States, and around the world.” Spencer has popularized the term “alt-right” to describe the movement he leads. Spencer has said his dream is “a new society, an ethno-state that would be a gathering point for all Europeans,” and has called for “peaceful ethnic cleansing.” For most of the day, a parade of speakers discussed their ideology in relatively anodyne terms, putting a presentable face on their agenda. But after dinner, when most journalists had already departed, Spencer rose and delivered a speech to his followers dripping with anti-Semitism, and leaving no doubt as to what he actually seeks. He referred to the mainstream media as “Lügenpresse,” a term he said he was borrowing from “the original German”; the Nazis used the word to attack their critics in the press. Continue Reading Frederick Carl Frieseke / Wikimedia The Running Conversation in Your Head Julie Beck What a close study of "inner speech" reveals about why humans talk to themselves Language is the hallmark of humanity—it allows us to form deep relationships and complex societies. But we also use it when we’re all alone; it shapes even our silent relationships with ourselves. In his book, The Voices Within, Charles Fernyhough gives a historical overview of “inner speech”—the more scientific term for “talking to yourself in your head.” Fernyhough, a professor at Durham University in the U.K., says that inner speech develops alongside social speech. This idea was pioneered by Lev Vygotsky, a Russian psychologist who studied children in the 1920s and noted that when they learned to talk to other humans, they also learned how to talk to themselves, first out loud, and eventually, in their heads. Continue Reading Mike Segar / Reuters The Electoral College Was Meant to Stop Men Like Trump From Being President Peter Beinart The founders envisioned electors as people who could prevent an irresponsible demagogue from taking office. Americans talk about democracy like it’s sacred. In public discourse, the more democratic American government is, the better. The people are supposed to rule. But that’s not the premise that underlies America’s political system. Most of the men who founded the United States feared unfettered majority rule. James Madison wrote in Federalist 10 that systems of government based upon “pure democracy … have ever been found incompatible with personal security or the rights of property.” John Adams wrote in 1814 that, “Democracy never lasts long. It soon wastes, exhausts and murders itself.” The framers constructed a system that had democratic features. The people had a voice. They could, for instance, directly elect members of the House of Representatives. But the founders also self-consciously limited the people’s voice. Continue Reading Yamada Taro / Getty What’s So Great About American World Leadership? Hugh White The U.S. voters who rejected decades of bipartisan foreign-policy consensus might be on to something. How has America come to elect a president who so starkly repudiated decades’ worth of the largely bipartisan vision of U.S. global leadership? And if that vision won’t be the basis of American foreign policy in the 21st century, what will replace it? The big message of 2016 is that large numbers of American voters, Democrat and Republican, do not buy what their political leaders have been selling for so long, and that includes foreign policy. The evidence of this from Trump’s victory is reinforced by Senator Bernie Sanders’ remarkable showing in the Democratic primaries, and by years’ worth of public-opinion surveys showing the widespread view that the United States “does too much in helping solve world problems.” It is also reinforced by the high poll numbers of an outgoing president who has mounted his own quiet campaign against key elements of Washington’s foreign-policy orthodoxy. Continue Reading Carlo Allegri / Reuters Donald Trump's Conflicts of Interest: A Crib Sheet Jeremy Venook A semi-comprehensive list of the business concerns that may influence the president-elect as he prepares for the nation’s highest office Though several previous presidents have entered office with private fortunes to their names, none has done so with a business empire nearly as large or complicated as that of President-elect Donald J. Trump. Estimates of Trump’s wealth vary substantially: While he self-reports a net worth of $10 billion, independent agencies have arrived at valuation generally between $3 billion and $5 billion. The unprecedented nature of Trump’s business interests, coupled with the many precedents that Trump broke throughout his campaign—not releasing his tax returns, for example, which severely limits attempts to understand his financial situation—has provoked speculation that his presidency may bring about equally unprecedented opportunities for conflicts of interest. Trump’s response—provided on Twitter—only reinforces concerns that he will make little effort to avoid entangling his business and personal interests, and will instead attack those who point that out.

Here’s why the race between Governor Pat McCrory and Democrat Roy Cooper isn’t over yet. DURHAM, N.C.—It’s been two weeks since Election Day, which means that in 49 states, residents know who their governor will be next year. North Carolinians, however, are still waiting to see. At the end of balloting on November 8, Democrat Roy Cooper, the current state attorney general, had a lead of a few thousand votes over Governor Pat McCrory, a Republican. Cooper promptly declared victory, but McCrory has not conceded the race, and the state has not been able to declare a winner. On Monday, Cooper announced a transition team, while McCrory accused him of “circumventing the electoral process.” Cooper’s lead fluctuated throughout the day on Tuesday as more counties returned their final canvass, but as of writing it was a little more than 6,000 votes out of roughly 4,700,000. (The most up-to-date results are here.) Continue Reading Carolyn Kaster / AP The Trump Takeover The Editors After a shocking upset, the president-elect and his party prepare for next year.

Every day in June, the most popular wedding month of the year, about 13,000 American couples will say “I do,” committing to a lifelong relationship that will be full of friendship, joy, and love that will carry them forward to their final days on this earth. Except, of course, it doesn’t work out that way for most people. The majority of marriages fail, either ending in divorce and separation or devolving into bitterness and dysfunction. Of all the people who get married, only three in ten remain in healthy, happy marriages, as psychologist Ty Tashiro points out in his book The Science of Happily Ever After, which was published earlier this year. Social scientists first started studying marriages by observing them in action in the 1970s in response to a crisis: Married couples were divorcing at unprecedented rates. Worried about the impact these divorces would have on the children of the broken marriages, psychologists decided to cast their scientific net on couples, bringing them into the lab to observe them and determine what the ingredients of a healthy, lasting relationship were. Was each unhappy family unhappy in its own way, as Tolstoy claimed, or did the miserable marriages all share something toxic in common? Continue Reading Etienne Fabre / SSAC A Shocking Find In a Neanderthal Cave In France Ed Yong A rock structure, built deep underground, is one of the earliest hominin constructions ever found. In February 1990, thanks to a 15-year-old boy named Bruno Kowalsczewski, footsteps echoed through the chambers of Bruniquel Cave for the first time in tens of thousands of years. The cave sits in France’s scenic Aveyron Valley, but its entrance had long been sealed by an ancient rockslide. Kowalsczewski’s father had detected faint wisps of air emerging from the scree, and the boy spent three years clearing away the rubble. He eventually dug out a tight, thirty-meter-long passage that the thinnest members of the local caving club could squeeze through. They found themselves in a large, roomy corridor. There were animal bones and signs of bear activity, but nothing recent. The floor was pockmarked with pools of water. The walls were punctuated by stalactites (the ones that hang down) and stalagmites (the ones that stick up). Continue Reading Ricardo Moraes / Reuters The Average 29-Year-Old Derek Thompson Forget media archetypes of older Millennials as college-educated singles living in cities. The typical 29-year-old is living with a partner in the suburbs—without a bachelor’s degree. What is the typical life experience for an American on the verge of turning 30? This is a hard question to answer, no matter who is asking. But it’s become especially difficult for an industry responsible with providing the answers: the national press. An irony of digital media is that the Internet distributes journalism, but it concentrates journalists. Jobs at media sites like The Atlantic, BuzzFeed, or Gawker are five-times more likely to be located in New York or Washington, D.C., than television-news jobs. The clustering force is only getting more centripetal: The share of reporting jobs in Los Angeles, NYC, and DC increased by 60 percent between 2004 and 2014. It’s easy to imagine many downsides of this agglomeration, like the dissolution of local reporting, but a subtler risk is that well-educated journalists in these dense cities wind up with a skewed impression of the world, a “majority illusion” based on the extremely unrepresentative cross-section of the country that’s immediately around them. To be fair, being a reporter in Des Moines or rural Nebraska, while it provides a better view of Des Moines and rural Nebraska, doesn’t offer a universal window into the average experiences of all Americans, either. For that, one needs something else, like a national survey.

Russia to reduce crew on ISS Reports from Russia's TASS news agency indicate that the Roscosmos space agency may reduce the number of Russian crew on the International Space Station from three to two (Ars Technica). Roscosmos's director of human programs, Sergei Krikalev, has reportedly said that the move would allow the space agency to reduce the cost of resupply missions to support its crew members. US space agency and ISS partner Nasa has confirmed that Russia is considering a crew reduction, but has indicated that "any questions about the near-term Russian Space budget or Russian ISS expedition size should be directed to the Roscosmos press office."

Google launches Duo secure mobile video calling Google has officially launched its new Duo video calling app for Android and iOS, first announced earlier this year at the Google I/O conference (VentureBeat). Duo is a mobile-only one-to-one video calling app that's built for speed, simplicity and security, with integrated end-to-end encryption. The app is being rolled out worldwide over the next week, and Android users can pre-register to automatically download it from the Play store as soon as it becomes available in their region. 3. FCC filing reveals partial spec for new HTC Nexus phones The USA's Federal Communications Commission (FCC) telecoms regulator has published data which appears to confirm that HTC will be making the forthcoming Google Nexus smartphones, dubbed Marlin and Sailfish (The Verge). The filing, made by HTC, indicates that documentation for the devices will be hosted by Google and includes information on the communications and networking standards the phones will support. So far, we know they'll support 802.11ac Wi-Fi, Bluetooth LE and NFC, but there are no further insights to be gleaned about their specification from the available data. 4. Artificial black hole provides strong evidence for Hawking radiation Israeli experimental physicist Jeff Steinhauer has produced the first strong evidence in support of Stephen Hawking's 1974 prediction that black holes shrink because they emit radiation (WIRED). Prof Steinhauer of the Israel Institute of Technology in Haifa has created an acoustic model of a black hole – from which sound, rather than light cannot escape – to observe Hawking-like radiation, which has thus far been impossible to observe in astronomical black holes as it's too weak to detect using current techniques. Steinhauer studied the behaviour of particles behave on the edge of his "black hole" and found that pairs of phonons – particles of sound – appear spontaneously in the void at the event horizon. One of the phonons travels away from the black hole as Hawking radiation, and the other partner phonon falls into the black hole.

Archaeologists reveal wooden 'Superhenge' near Stonehenge Archaeologists excavating a site near Stonehenge, dubbed 'Superhenge' when it was discovered last year, have found that, rather than standing stones, the great structure was made with huge timber posts (Motherboard). Situated a few kilometres northeast of Stonehenge, early radar scans led researchers to expect a structure of 90 stone monoliths. Instead, the Bronze Age site appears to have been made using wooden posts and to have been hastily deconstructed in a manner the could indicate political or religious upheaval 4,500 years ago. Nick Snashall of the National Trust said that "what we've discovered are that there are two enormous pits for timber posts. They have got ramps at the sides to lower posts into. They did contain timbers which have been vertically lifted out and removed at some stage. The top was then filled in with chalk rubble and then the giant henge bank was raised over the top." 6. Pokémon Go cheats to be banned for life Niantic Labs has updated the terms of service for augmented reality hit Pokémon Go to introduce new penalties for cheating (TechCrunch). Accounts found to be "falsifying your location, using emulators, modified or unofficial software and/or accessing Pokémon GO clients or backends in an unauthorized manner including through the use of third-party software" can now receive a lifetime ban from the game, although affected users can appeal against bans. The moves follow Niantic's crack-downs on third-party tracking services and, most recently, "farming" services that automate certain gameplay elements by simulating movement, creating serious gameplay imbalances for honest players. 7. Nvidia packs desktop-grade graphics into its new laptop GPUs Nvidia has launched its latest range of laptop graphics chipsets and, like the laptop version of the company's GTX 980, they're effectively indistinguishable from their desktop counterparts, bar the absence of features such as voltage adjustment (Ars Technica). The newly released graphics processors are already available in new heavy-duty gaming laptops from MSI, Asus, Alienware, Lenovo and Razer. The full range of new GPUs includes the GTX 1060, GTX 1070 and, most impressively, the hugely powerful GTX 1080, complete with 16nm Pascal architecture, 2560 CUDA cores and 8GB of GDDR5X graphics memory.

Minecraft is out for the Oculus Rift Microsoft-owned Minecraft creator Mojang has announced that the block-crafting hit is now available on the Oculus Rift virtual reality headset (Popular Science). You'll need both a Rift and a copy of Minecraft for Windows 10 Edition beta, which is still available free to anyone who already has the standard Windows/Linux/macOS Java version. While this isn't the first VR version of Minecraft – that honour goes to the Samsung Gear VR mobile edition – it's the first to take advantage of the power of a desktop virtual reality system, and comes equipped with PC-friendly features, including mouse and keyboard support, and the option of switching from full immersive VR to a "virtual living room" that displays the game on a virtual reality rendition of a standard flat panel monitor. 9. Hidden Figures trailer looks at brains behind Nasa's space race 20th Century Fox has released a trailer for Hidden Figures, a film that tells the often-neglected stories of Nasa mathematicians and computers Katherine Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan and Mary Jackson, black women who carried out the critical calculations that fuelled the success of the US space programme during the 1960s (The Verge). The film stars Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer and Janelle Monáe, and is due out in January 2017. 10. Video: Monster Boy is a perfect spiritual successor to Wonder Boy in Monster Land The GamesCom trailer for Monster Boy and the Cursed Kingdom showcases what looks to be a perfect successor to beloved Sega platform/RPG hybrid Wonder Boy in Monster Land (Eurogamer). Developed by US studio Game Atelier USA and Ryuichi Nishizawa, one of the driving forces behind the original Wonder Boy series, the new trailer shows six different playable character forms, from a lion to a frog, each with unique abilities required to navigate specific challenges in different parts of the game world. The game is due out on Xbox One, PS4 and PC later this year. Popular on WIRED Sushi-making robot creates artful snack using motorised arms – and even adds wasabi It can take Japanese chefs years to master how to make sushi, which is considered an art form as well as a nutritious meal. But now there’s a robot that can create a perfect plate of sushi, adding fish and wasabi to sticky rice, before presenting it professionally on a board in next to no time. The robotic chef, created by Kawasaki – the world’s largest manufacturer of automation robots – uses its arms to manipulate the food and is the latest in a line of mechanical foodies, including a pancake-flipping android and biscuit-dunking machine. Kawasaki adapted a double-arm Scara robot to make the unnamed sushi bot, which was put through its paces at its Kawasaki Robo stage showroom in Tokyo.

Google In a bid to take-on Apple's FaceTime, and Skype, Google has launched its own video calling application. ADVERTISEMENT Duo, which was originally announced in May at the company's I/O developer conference, is being made available for anyone to download. The software is a "1-to-1 video calling app" that's being made available on both iOS and Android devices at the same time. Read more Google's AI just created its own universal 'language' Google's AI just created its own universal 'language' By Matt Burgess "Duo calls are in crisp HD video (up to 720p) and audio," Google said when it announced the app earlier this year. According to the company the quality of calls "adjusts" as the local network conditions change. When there's a low signal, or poor Wi-Fi connection, the video quality will be reduced. For those wanting to use the app, a Google account isn't needed. The firm says it works through a person's phone number and accessing contacts stored on a device. ADVERTISEMENT Read more Google is helping Full Fact create an automated, real-time fact-checker Google is helping Full Fact create an automated, real-time fact-checker By Matt Burgess Duo, Google says, has been built with privacy in mind. As such, all video calls made across the app are protected by end-to-end encryption – one of the mathematically stronger forms of cryptography. FaceTime is also encrypted in the same way. Google says: "For video calls on the go, Duo will switch between Wi-Fi and cellular data automatically without dropping your call." ADVERTISEMENT One feature – Knock Knock – lets a person with the app "see live video of your caller before you answer". This is intended to show the recipient where the person is, and what they're doing, before you pick-up the call. The roll out of the app has started and Google says it will be available worldwide in the next few days. At the time of writing the app isn't showing in the UK's iOS store.

Four years ago, I was one of the few die-hard BlackBerry owners left, as the company began to derail. Today, the company thinks Android can get it back on the tracks. Its debut Android smartphone was a flop, but it hopes that it can redeem itself with its reinvented BlackBerry DTEK50, which it bills as "the world's most secure Android smartphone" today. That largely unchecked and untested claim was enough to grab our attention, given that many still don't believe that "Android" and "security" in the same sentence can be anything more than a contradiction. After two weeks of scrutinizing those claims, here's what we learned. BlackBerry's DTEK50 is a passable smartphone that was in most cases able to match the security features of other similarly secure devices, like Apple's iPhone and Google's Nexus. But the DTEK50 was not able to outperform or raise the security bar in any meaningful way. In part because of that, we dispute the company's claim that this is "the world's most secure Android smartphone." Rapid security patching is good -- when it works Ask anyone in security, and keeping to a regular patching schedule is by far the most effective way of nixing most known security issues. That's why, in the wake of the "Stagefright" vulnerability last year, Google began to offer monthly security patches. Top ZDNET Reviews Dell Latitude 11 5000 7.9 Apple iPhone 7 Plus 9.3 Amazon Echo 9.0 Google Pixel XL Phone 8.0 Google's own-branded Nexus devices would be given the patches first, and other companies would follow in the coming days and weeks -- though, some wouldn't keep to a schedule at all. BlackBerry promised that it will similarly provide same-day patches for security issues (which was described as "zero day" patching to some, a confusing echo of a common malware descriptor), once they are released by Google or its partners. SECURITY Need a secure smartphone? Answer is simple This is what the foremost security experts and privacy-minded people say. Read More BlackBerry said if it can fix issues that are disclosed outside of that schedule, it will. There's no real way to test this, but we struck lucky -- for want of a better term -- when we found that the DTEK50 was already vulnerable, straight off the manufacturing line, to one of four new security flaws, dubbed "Quadrooter" -- despite being up-to-date with Google's monthly patching schedule. Three of the flaws were already fixed and were rolled out as part of July's monthly batch of security patches. Qualcomm, which was charged with making a fix for the fourth, has released an emergency patch, but it won't be widely released until September. At the time of writing this review, BlackBerry hadn't patched the Quadrooter flaw, and a BlackBerry spokesperson didn't respond to repeated emails requesting to comment. (Update: After this security analysis was posted, BlackBerry confirmed it released a patch for unlocked phones, but those tied to a carrier will not receive the patch until carriers' give their approval.) By delivering patches faster and on a regular basis, Android's patch schedule is arguably better than Apple's, which is erratic and usually only released when bundled with other software improvements. But good patch management only works when it's put into practice. Hardware root-of-trust and secure boot: Welcome, but not new You might not know about the phone's hardware root of trust or the secure boot process, but it's a vital part of ensuring that your phone maintains its security integrity. Every process of the phone's switch-on procedure is cryptographically signed. In other words, if a hacker has tampered with anything in the boot process, the codes will not match up, and the process stops dead. For instance, if malware's found, the phone just won't boot, which prevents your data from being decrypted. Think of it as a dead man's switch (and BlackBerry documents this in detail in a deep-dive blog post). (Image: ZDNet/CBS Interactive) It's why Apple has included these features in its iPhone for many years, as do modern Samsung phones that come equipped with its Knox technology. Android comes with this feature baked in, but it'll become a strictly enforced feature when Android Nougat, the latest iteration of the operating system, is rolled out. When the DTEK50 gets the new software in the months after its launch, executives said, that'll make verifying the phone's boot process far stronger. In the meantime, it's a good start, but it doesn't nudge the security needle forward. Encryption as standard, but questions over Android "hardening" Encryption has become a controversial topic in the past year. Apple got it out of the gate first, largely because the company controls the hardware and software package. Android stumbled because of performance and fragmentation issues. Just as all modern iPhone and Android Marshmallow devices and later, the DTEK50 comes with full-disk encryption -- an increasingly commonplace smartphone feature. BlackBerry also touts its Android "hardening" effort, which it argues makes it tougher for attackers to extract data or take control of a device. One of those features includes "improved random number" generation, which we wrote about in more detail here. The short version is that, according to cryptographers who spoke to us about this, BlackBerry's hardening efforts "doesn't meaningfully change the security of the phone," because the company is trying to fix something that isn't broken. And because BlackBerry used a largely secret and proprietary method to try to improve the cryptography -- which can't be inspected or verified by security experts -- the phone may be secure, but until we know how and why, we can't (and shouldn't) fully trust the phone. DTEK's app will pacify and inform, but not block My biggest gripe with the phone's flagship app, which first debuted with the Priv, was that it didn't do anything -- and it still doesn't. In case you missed it, the phone is named after its flagship app, DTEK, a play on "detect." The app sits on your home screen, acting as a gateway health dashboard for your phone. It tells you how secure your device is, such as if a strong passcode has been set, and even when apps use your phone's features. If a malicious app triggers your camera or your microphone, it'll tell you -- but it won't block it. (Image: ZDNet/CBS Interactive) BlackBerry said that the app hasn't changed since it was first rolled out to the Priv, despite a promise from David Kleidermacher, chief security officer, who said the app would be "constantly" improved. We had some harsh words for the app the first time around -- all of which still stands today. "DTEK isn't much more than an information app in that it tells you when things are happening, unlike a privacy app which actively mitigates against data-slurping incursions [...] It doesn't prevent your data from being slurped up by the various apps you use, nor does it give you an option to do much about it -- except uninstall the apps." Now both the Priv and the DTEK50 are running Android Marshmallow, and both phones now come with iPhone-style app permissions by default, so you have greater granular control over your apps and what they can access. I'd put that down as a win for Android, over any worthwhile improvement on BlackBerry's part -- though it nevertheless puts the DTEK50 on a par with other devices that run Android Marshmallow, as well as the iPhone. Bottom line: Security, take two, but no lessons learned Android already has a bad rap when it comes to security and privacy. Anything to boost that impression could be a boon to business -- if done right. But BlackBerry hasn't learned any lessons from its first Android incarnation, and by its own admission hasn't improved the phone's security in any consequential way. Case in point: Alex Thurber, the company's global device sales chief, told us at a meeting that the Priv and the DTEK50 are "the two most secure smartphones," because the Priv is "as secure" as the DTEK50. The reality is that when you cut through the marketing fluff, you're still faced with an unremarkable phone, which, like any other product or service, takes one hole in the security facade to bring the entire thing down. Granted, the company didn't know about Quadrooter ahead of time. Its so-called privacy app doesn't block or mitigate, and only passively advises. We can welcome its hardware improvements, but it's not enough to nudge it past that already-high security bar to achieve status as "the world's most secure Android smartphone." Marketing and selling this phone as more secure than other phones that are equal or better in the security space is going to give people false hope, and that's dangerous for those who think this phone will defeat hackers and attackers at every hurdle. Security researchers will tell you that the most secure smartphones will be the least useful to most people. But in absence of perfection, many will choose an iPhone over anything else. Tried and tested, the iPhone was able to withstand government demands for customer data -- and, though not perfect, Apple's closed in-house duopoly of hardware and software makes it far tougher to crack than most other devices. So what's the most secure Android phone available now? Your best bet is a Nexus smartphone, which researchers believe are the least vulnerable to flaws and issues because of rapid vulnerability patching.

 Russia fails to reach settlement with Google in Android case Reuters Aug. 16, 2016, 10:39 AM 35 facebook linkedin twitter email print Android mascots are lined up in the demonstration area at the Google I/O Developers Conference in the Moscone Center in San Francisco Thomson Reuters MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia's state anti-monopoly watchdog FAS said on Tuesday it and Alphabet Inc's Google had failed to reach an out-of-court settlement in a case over Google's Android operating system, Interfax news agency reported. The watchdog last week imposed a 438 million ruble ($6.85 million) fine on Google after ruling last year that the firm was abusing its dominance by requiring the pre-installation of certain applications on mobile devices using Android, following a complaint by Russia's Yandex. Google had appealed the ruling while FAS said an out-of court deal was possible should Google admit to violations of antitrust laws and pay a fine. "The talks with Google on the issue of the settlement agreement have come to nothing. Now it's up to the court to draw a line under this case," Interfax quoted Elena Zaeva, head of FAS's Department for Regulation of Telecommunications and Information Technology, as saying. Zaeva was quoted as saying a court would hear Google's appeal on Wednesday. Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Android 7.0 Nougat: 6 helpful new features to try first Video Rapid review: Hasselblad True Zoom Moto Mod During an hour-long Hangouts web chat for the media and select IT professionals, Google today provided a glimpse of some of the new security features in its upcoming mobile OS, Android 7.0 "Nougat," which should be available on Google Nexus devices "in a few weeks," according to the company. The online briefing wasn't meant to be exhaustive. Instead, it provided a top-level look at a set of new security and management tools in Android Nougat and Android for Work. Here's a breakdown of some of the most notable security improvements in Nougat, for Android users and IT administrators. Android Nougat 7.0 platform-security enhancements 1. Direct boot and stronger encryption Android Nougat users who encrypt their phones will no longer have to enter a security code after a reboot and then wait for their devices to restart in order to use core native features. Google apps including the phone and alarm will work on encrypted phones after a reboot, but the passcode will be required to access data using those apps, such as a phone contact list. Google New file-based encryption works at a more granular level to better isolate users and profiles in Android. And hardware-backed encryption keys are required for all new Android phones that run Nougat. 2. Stronger MediaServer and platform hardening  Google caught a lot of flack related to flaws in its Android MediaServer components that enabled the Stagefright attacks earlier this year, and it says it strengthened the MediaServer in many ways. For example, Android 7.0 Nougat gives attackers who might breach MediaServer access to fewer permissions, according to Google. [Related: Android, iOS bug bounty biz is booming] Android Nougat also requires that all devices support verified boot, so corrupt phones or tablets won't start at all, or will only grant access to "safe" apps and services after they start, Google says.  3. App security and abuse prevention Apps on previous Android versions used to be able to share user-granted permissions with other apps much more easily, according to Google. In Nougat, the company cracked down on permission sharing between apps. And apps with device admin permissions in Android Nougat can no longer prevent users from uninstalling them or change users' PIN, passwords or codes to lock them out of their devices. 4. 'Seamless' Android updates  When Nougat software updates are available for new phones, users can choose to download and install them in a separate on-device partition, so they don't need to stop using their phones or tablets during the process. The next time they reboot their phones, the new software will auto-install much more quickly than in the past, according to the company. Unfortunately, only new phones optimized for Nougat will have access to this feature.  Google also says it removed the annoying "app optimization" step of the Android upgrade process, so Nougat devices won't be useless for 10 minutes or more after a new OS patch is applied, while apps optimize for the changes. Android Nougat 7.0 corporate-security enhancements Google didn't provide as many specifics about the IT security features in Nougat, but it did offer a glimpse of some of the most interesting improvements. 1. Nougat's 'always-on VPN' An enhanced "always-on VPN" feature lets IT force certain business apps to use a VPN to connect to the web. If a VPN isn't available or can't connect, the apps won't work or share any data.  2. Android 'work security challenge' A "work security challenge" feature lets IT set separate, complex passcodes on users' devices to protect specific work data, using Android profiles, and users can employ simpler PINs or codes to access their personal data. IT can set lock restrictions for specific apps, and admins can choose to use different looking login screens so users visually know when they log into corporate services. 3. 'Work mode' in Nougat A new "work mode" icon in the Android Nougat dropdown menu, which looks like a briefcase, lets user disable all work related apps after hours or when they don't want to be distracted. Google 4. Nougat phone and dialer tweaks The Android 7.0 Nougat dialer component further integrates with corporate systems and directories, according to Google, and users can search both work and personal contact lists from one place. If a business user receives a call from someone in their work directory, their caller ID can be set by admins to notify them that the call is likely work related. Call logs can be separated into business and personal lists. And other UX modifications aim to make it clear when calls or contacts are personal or work related. Google Google also said many of the work-versus-personal changes are meant to serve as a "foundation for a second phone line for business" in addition to a personal line on a single device. In fact, APIs already exist that enable certain VoIP apps to create separate phones lines within a single dialer in Android Nougat, according to Google. 5. QR code provisioning in Nougat A new Nougat feature lets IT admins provision devices that don't support the NFC "Android bump" feature, using a QR code. 6. New remote bug reports and process logging Enhancements to Android's remote diagnostic tools in Nougat give admins more options to request remote bug reports, though in many cases, users must approve the requests for access to potentially sensitive information. Google said it will provide additional details on Android 7.0 Nougat and Android for work when the new mobile OS is released in the coming weeks.

The latest Samsung smartphone currently runs on Android 6.0 Marshmallow.  ( Samsung ) Advertisement The Samsung Galaxy Note 7 could get Android 7.0 Nougat software update as early as October this year. It is very likely that Google will launch and release its 2016 Nexus phones, code-named Marlin and Sailfish, in October. These devices will be the first ones to come running on Android 7.0 Nougat. Google normally releases its latest mobile operating system to other Nexus devices. The update is then rolled out to international models of smartphones followed by devices on individual carriers. Koh Dong-jin, the president of Mobile Communications at Samsung Electronics, has disclosed that beta testing of Android 7.0 Nougat for the Galaxy Note 7 will begin soon. "It is very important for us to offer up-to-date information with the new OS, but what's more crucial is to build a stable and seamless platform for users," said Koh. "That's why we are planning to do enough beta testing before any OS updates." Market experts believe that Samsung will roll out Android 7.0 Nougat for the international variant of the Galaxy Note 7 in Korea during the software's early rollout stage. The Galaxy Note 7 in other regions including the United States may have to wait longer, probably until 2017, to receive the software update. Some customers in the United States may also have to wait even longer as some carriers release software updates swiftly while others take their time. For instance, the Galaxy Note 5 and Galaxy S6 edge+ were launched in August 2015 running on Android 5.1.1 Lollipop. Although Google released Android 6.0 Marshmallow in October 2015, AT&T customers who have those smartphone models had to wait until June this year to receive the update. Sprint and Verizon Wireless rolled out Android 6.0 Marshmallow to its Galaxy Note 5 a bit earlier in March. Meanwhile, Android 7.0 Nougat is expected to bring a number of new features to the table. Customers will be able to install apps faster on their devices running on the OS. Users will also find better battery management features in the software. New security patches will be automatically downloaded silently in the background and they will be ready to use when the device is restarted. Samsung has many smartphones that are expected to receive the Android 7.0 Nougat update, but the company has not confirmed the rollout date for the software. The Galaxy Note 7 being the latest handset should be one of the first Samsung phones to get Google's upcoming update. At this point, it remains to be seen how swiftly Android 7.0 Nougat makes its way to the Galaxy Note 7 and other Samsung devices.

Home construction in the U.S. accelerated in July to the fastest pace in five months. While housing starts were up 2.1 percent nationally, new construction was up 15.5 percent in the Northeast, led by a surge in new apartment and condo construction.

Barnes & Noble ousts CEO Struggling bookseller Barnes & Noble says its chief executive officer is departing after just a year. The company's board says it determined Ronald D. Boire was not a good fit for the company and it is in the “best interests of all parties” for him to step down. The company did not give specifics. Executive chairman and former CEO Leonard Riggio, who was scheduled to retire Sept. 14, will postpone his retirement. A search for a new CEO will begin immediately. Barnes & Noble is working on a turnaround plan involving cutting costs and closing stores after years of weak results. Boire previously worked as CEO of Sears Canada. Ford eyes 2021 for fully autonomous car Ford Motor Co. says it will have a fully autonomous vehicle ready to provide ride-hailing or ride-sharing services by 2021. Ford CEO Mark Fields announced the goal Tuesday at the company's Silicon Valley campus in Palo Alto, Calif. Ford said its vehicle won't need a steering wheel or gas and brake pedals. That's a break from many other companies, who plan to gradually add self-driving capability to traditional cars. Ford's vehicle will be specifically designed for commercial mobility services, such as taxi companies, and will be available in high volumes. Ford said self-driving cars for standard consumers will be offered later. Google Duo app joins video calling market Google's video chatting app has arrived. The app, dubbed Duo, represents Google's response to other popular video calling options, including Apple's FaceTime, Microsoft's Skype and Facebook's Messenger app. Duo isn't much different from the other video chatting services, except that it gives a glimpse at who is making the call, helping the recipient decide whether to answer. Google calls this feature, “Knock, knock.” The app is a free service for phones running on Google's Android operating system as well as Apple's iPhones. Like FaceTime for iPhones, Duo only requires a person's phone number to connect. Many other services require both participants to have account logins to use their video calling options. Shell subsidiary to build link to cracker A subsidiary of Royal Dutch Shell plans to build a 94-mile pipeline system to deliver ethane from three shale gas processing plants in Pennsylvania and Ohio to the petrochemical facility it will build in Beaver County. Shell said it will move about 100,000 barrels per day on the so-called Falcon Ethane Pipeline System once it is operational between the facility in Potter and Center, and processing stations in Houston, Pa., and Scio and Cadiz, Ohio. Construction is expected to begin in late 2018. Shell Pipeline Co. this month began acquiring rights of way on land. Next year, Shell plans to start building its plant, which will convert liquid ethane from shale gas wells into the building blocks of plastics. Home construction jumps in July Apartment construction in the Northeast fueled a jump in home building in July as the pace of housing starts nationwide reached the strongest pace in six months. The rate of overall construction rose 2.1 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.21 million from 1.19 million in June, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. That was the highest level since February. Most of the gain was from an 8.3 percent acceleration in the construction of multi-family buildings. Construction of single-family houses edged up just 0.3 percent. Washington County mall sold for $20M A Washington County shopping center has been sold to an undisclosed buyer for $20 million. Philadelphia-based real estate investment trust Preit announced the sale of the Washington Crown Center on Tuesday. The mall, about 25 miles southwest of Pittsburgh, has anchor stores including Bon-Ton, Macy's, Gander Mountain and Sears. Preit CEO Joseph Coradino said his company is focused on developing a strong portfolio of assets. Preit also owns Beaver Valley Mall in Monaca, which is for sale. U.S. consumer prices unchanged in July Consumer prices were unchanged in July as a big drop in gasoline and other energy prices kept inflation under control. The Labor Department said Tuesday that the flat reading for overall inflation followed a 0.2 percent gain in June. Energy prices fell by the largest amount in five months. Core inflation, which excludes volatile energy and food, edged up 0.1 percent in July, the smallest increase in four months. The Federal Reserve has an inflation target of 2 percent annual increases. Core inflation has risen 2.2 percent during the past 12 months, but overall inflation still is well below the Fed's target, rising just 0.8 percent in the past 12 months. The Fed has left interest rates unchanged after a single rate hike in December. Airbnb tries concierge role with app for dining, city guides Airbnb Inc. is pressing ahead with plans to expand into new travel services such as restaurant reservations and city tours, transforming the company from a single-minded home-rental service to a multipurpose trip planner. The company is testing a stand-alone mobile app for finding and organizing travel plans, highlighting the importance of the initiative to the company. A test version of the software is called Airbnb Trips, according to an Android app listing on the Google Play Store. The app offers access to personal itineraries with information about upcoming Airbnb rentals, city guidebooks, and dining and happy hour events. A person familiar with the matter said the app's name and features could change before its release. Hedge-fund manager Cohen settles with commodities agency Billionaire hedge-fund manager Steven A. Cohen, who was accused of failing to prevent massive insider trading at his firm, has agreed in a settlement with the government not to engage in any activities overseen by federal commodities regulators until at least Dec. 31, 2017. The settlement, announced Tuesday by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, follows on the action brought against Cohen by the Securities and Exchange Commission over insider trading at his firm, formerly called SAC Capital Advisors. In an agreement with the SEC in January, Cohen was barred for two years from managing other people's money. He wasn't fined under the agreement and neither admitted nor denied the SEC's allegations. The SEC had alleged that Cohen ignored red flags and failed to prevent one of his SAC portfolio managers, Mathew Martoma, from illegally reaping profits. Factory output jumps 0.5 percent for biggest gain in year U.S. factories cranked out more vehicles, machinery and chemicals in July, lifting production by the most in a year. The Federal Reserve said Tuesday that factory output grew 0.5 percent in July, following a 0.3 percent gain in June. The figures suggest U.S. manufacturing might be turning a corner after struggling to overcome the impact of a stronger dollar, slower overseas growth and falling oil prices. Still, factory output is just 0.2 percent higher than it was a year ago. And even as output ticks up, manufacturers aren't adding many jobs. Overall industrial production, which includes utilities and mining, expanded 0.7 percent. That is the biggest increase since November 2014. Utilities output jumped 2.1 percent as hotter-than-usual weather boosted air conditioning use. Mining activity rose 0.7 percent, its third consecutive gain.

Now it's the No. 1 form of electronic correspondence in the U.S.  But as traditional e-mail falls out of favor with a growing sliver of the population, Google has struggled to release newer messaging tools that resonate widely.  Now Google is trying again with a new video chat application called Duo. The app works with mobile devices running Google’s Android operating system and Apple Inc.’s iOS. It runs on Wi-Fi and cellular networks, automatically switching between different types and speeds of connection and adjusting video quality. Duo also uses phone numbers, rather than a Google account or Gmail address, making it easier to call friends, family and other people already stored on smartphone contact lists. The company’s existing video calling and messaging app, Hangouts, requires a Google account which limited adoption, especially in emerging markets. Facebook Inc.’s WhatsApp and Messenger, Skype -- now owned by Microsoft Corp. --  and Apple's FaceTime used phone numbers to grow faster. A confusing array of communication options has held Google back. It has two e-mail services -- Gmail, which is the top e-mail service in the U.S. based on unique visitors, according to ComScore, and Inbox; three text offerings, Hangouts, Messenger and the upcoming Allo; and now two video chat services, Duo and Hangouts (which offers texting and video calls). This scattershot approach, and Google’s late start, is becoming more costly for the Alphabet Inc. division as messaging evolves from a simple way to communicate quickly into one of the next big technology platforms supporting digital commerce, advertising and new services powered by artificial-intelligence. "Google missed it because of the requirement that you needed a Google ID to communicate with others," said Ankit Jain, a former Googler and executive at SimilarWeb Inc., which measures website and mobile app usage. Hangouts ranked 84th among Android apps in the U.S. in July, based on installs and usage, according to SimilarWeb. That lagged Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp and Snapchat. Nick Fox, a 13-year Google veteran, was tasked by Google Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai 18 months ago with fixing the sprawl. Soon after, his new team formulated a strategy and started building Duo and Allo. "Google sees communication as this essential human need, whether that’s through text, a picture, calling someone or doing a video call." Fox said in a recent interview. This insight is a decade old and has guided Facebook’s strategy since its creation in 2004. Asian companies, like Tencent Holdings Ltd.’s WeChat and Line, have grown into tech powerhouses by connecting people through communication apps and offering related services on top of their networks. Skype, founded in 2003, became a leading video chat app on a similar foundation. So how is Fox going to catch up? Job number one is clearing up the bloated smorgasbord of Google communications services. Hangouts will be a workplace service, offering group video conferencing mostly via desktop computers and office laptops, Fox said. It will be integrated more with Google’s work software, such as Docs, Sheets and Slides, which will be easier to share. Duo is a mobile app and only allows one-to-one video calling, limiting it as a consumer offering. Allo, a messaging service coming out later this year, will also target consumers, Fox said. Google’s Messenger is a basic text system, part of a group of services provided to wireless carriers that work closely with Android. The second tactic: Bringing what Fox says is better technology to the new services to catch up with rivals.  Duo constantly performs "bandwidth estimation" to understand how much video can be delivered. If Wi-Fi weakens, it switches to a phone’s cellular network. If a cellular signal drops as low as 2G, Duo will automatically cut video and maintain audio. Allo will use Google’s expertise in AI to automatically understand texts and provide useful suggestions. Google will also let third-party developers create chatbots that will interact with Allo users through messages. That’s already being tried by other companies such as Facebook and Microsoft, but Google has been working hard on AI for about a decade, so it may be more advanced. "First build a great product," Fox said, repeating a common Google mantra. "Once you get people to love it, they will share it with friends and co-workers and it grows."  Google was late in other technology and caught up, Fox noted. Gmail started in 2004, more than six years after Yahoo Mail, but Google’s offer of mountains of free storage won over hundreds of millions of users. Google’s Chrome emerged in 2008 -- over a decade after Microsoft’s Internet Explorer -- and is now the most popular web browser partly because of speed and frequent updates. Better technology may not be enough to catch up, Jain said. WhatsApp and Snapchat offered something useful enough to persuade many people to switch away from their existing communication service where all their friends already were. Duo’s promise of video calling for everyone on Android and iOS is something that Hangouts already offers, but that didn’t move the needle enough, he noted. "It’s worth another shot, but having better tech can’t be the only thing," Jain said. Print reprints Favorite EMAIL Tweet Please Log In or Register to post comments.

However, by the second half, the US adjusted and the gap in talent proved to be too much. This US team had a second gear when things became dicey, Japan did not. This game was not the cakewalk that the 110-64 final score would suggest it was, but by the end the US team clearly showed why they’re the heavy favorites. And that will do it for our live coverage of USA women’s basketball, but the Guardian will continue to have literal around-the-clock coverage of the Olympics until the closing ceremonies.

Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.35pm EDT 18:35 The question is: how could Japan pull off an upset here. Well, it’s partly to keep up the same level of intensity while also continuing to keep the US away from the free throw line. And then continue to have the same success from beyond the three point line. In other words: there’s a way to do it. But it’s a lot to ask a team. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.31pm EDT 18:31 Hey Swin Cash!

Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.28pm EDT 18:28 Halftime thoughts A lot more entertaining first half than what I was expecting. I would normally say that the US should probably put some distance between them and Japan fairly quickly in the third but I’m not entirely sure that Japan’s going to go away that easily. I still don’t see the US losing here, but it’s now officially on the table.

Not a lot of free throw shooting this game, which is probably not good for the US but I’m not complaining as a viewer.

After that, Spain beat Turkey 64-62. I wouldn’t expect our game’s final score to be this close. After our game, Canada will face off against France around 9:15pm EST. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.58pm EDT 16:58 Preamble This sounds like it should be hyperbole, but it’s just the truth: the US women’s team might be one of the greatest collections of basketball talent ever. Obviously, this statement will end up looking foolish should they somehow fail to win the gold but, unlike their peers on the men’s team, they have yet to show any signs of vulnerability. While both teams are currently undefeated heading into the knockout rounds, the men’s team has played three straight closer-than-expected games, while the women’s team has been completely demolishing their competition. Their point differential during the preliminaries has been a ridiculous +204 while the men’s team has put up a comparatively underwhelming +117 after winning their games against Serbia and France by only three points. So, it’s not entirely certain that there’s a team out there that could possibly knock the US women out of this tournament. It’s definitely difficult to imagine this Japanese team pulling off the shocking upset. Japan has only familiar to US fans, Ramu Tokashiki, who plays for the Seattle Storm, where she received an All-Rookie nod in her debut season. Japan went 3-2 during the preliminary stage, squeaking into the quarterfinals as the fourth seed in Group A. (Oh, and for comparison their point differential so far in the Olympics has been +8). So it’s a bit of an understatement to say that the US are the favorites in this matchup, but, well, there’s a reason they play the games. That’s the beauty of these Olympics: there’s a 80% chance we’ll witness a dominant performance, a 19% chance we’ll have an entertaining game and a 1% chance of one of the most surprising upsets of the year. In any event, it should be fun. And, as always, we encourage your feedback. We’ll post your emails (you can address those to Hunter.Felt@theguardian.com) and tweets (to @HunterFelt) throughout today’s game. Opening tip is scheduled at 5:45pm EST but I’ll be back well before then.

Google Duo, a 1-to-1 video calling app, launched this week to as fast and reliable answer to Apple's FaceTime that works on both iOS and Android. A successful run for Duo, along with messaging app Allo, could mean that users never leave the Google ecosystem that's already popular for email, calendars, and master sign-ins, said Max Wolff, chief economist at Manhattan Venture Partners. It comes as video and text messaging apps, like Google's new Allo and Duo, increasingly play the role of the one-stop shop that was once the job of the operating system, Wolff told CNBC's "Closing Bell" on Tuesday. Google originally announced the app at its developer conference earlier this year, where the artificially intelligent connections between the new apps was the highlight of the event. "Google's making sure they don't get left behind in a world dominated by the WhatsApp, and the Snapchat, and the FaceTimes and the Apples, who are basically their major competitors," Wolff said. Despite the competition, Wolff said it's dangerous to count out Google too soon. Google's apps are among the most popular across both iOS and Android operating systems, Wolff said. "With ... 85-plus percent market share in the developing market where new users are just coming on, they have a pretty good chance of being the first app you use for a couple of tens of millions of people in the next six months," Wolff said, noting that Duo does well in low-bandwidth environments that are common in some developing markets. "That will be the real test if they can have legs and run with this."

On Tuesday, the search giant released Duo, its new video calling app. Google designed Duo to be like FaceTime — easy to use. As with Apple’s app, users can simply tap on a friend’s name from their address book and connect. “Video calling is the next best thing to being with someone in person, but too often it can be a frustrating or complicated experience,” Justin Uberti, a principal software engineer, wrote on Google’s company blog site. “Duo takes the complexity out of video calling, so that you can be together in the moment wherever you are.” Duo has one big advantage over FaceTime — it allow Android users to place video calls to iPhone owners and vice versa. FaceTime only works on Apple devices. Google also added a cool feature not present in FaceTime to Duo. Dubbed Knock Knock, it offers a kind of preview of the video call. Knock Knock allows the recipient of a call to see a live view of the person placing the call to get a sense not only of who is calling but why. And Duo has a simpler initial view than FaceTime. Where FaceTime’s home screen offers a list of contacts users have recently called, Duo show users a view of themselves and a big “video call” button. If users tap on that button, they’ll see a list of friends who they can call on the app. If they’ve placed calls recently, they’ll also see thumbnail pictures of the friends they’ve contacted on the homescreen. Those pictures act as buttons that allow them to make a quick follow-up video call. But in general, the app works much like FaceTime. Like Apple’s app, it’s only used for calling; users can’t send text messages through it. As with FaceTime interactions, Duo encrypts calls made through it, so users don’t have to worry about someone spying on their conversations. And as with FaceTime, Duo automatically identifies people in users’ address books who can be reached through the app. On Tuesday, I did a quick test of Duo, which Google announced in May at its annual developer conference. It worked mostly as advertised. My wife was able to easily place a call from her iPhone to mine using the app. I was able to return her call quickly by simply tapping on a thumbnail picture button on the Duo home screen. The video was generally smooth, although there was a hiccup in it. The app is supposed to be able to keep a video call going even if your phone switches from a WiFi to a cellular network. But while talking with my daughter, the video of me cut out when I turned off my WiFi radio. I was able to see her, but she could only hear me. My video resumed when I turned my WiFi radio back on. Google is no stranger to video calling. Users of Google Talk could place video calls on their PCs eight years ago. Google Hangouts, which the company launched three years ago, allows users to connect on PCs and mobile devices and can be used for video conferences involving multiple people. And users of Google’s Android operating system have numerous choices for video calling apps, including Skype, Facebook Messenger, and WeChat. Cell providers Verizon and T-Mobile also offer video calling features for Android phones. But until now, Android users haven’t had something as easy and ubiquitous to use for video chats as FaceTime. While Hangouts comes pre-installed on most devices, it’s a much more complicated app that can be difficult to use. With Skype, Facebook and other apps, users can typically only place video calls to people who are using the same app. And in some cases users have to know a person’s often idiosyncratic log-on name to connect. And the cell phone video services generally allow users to place video calls only to other users who have certain phones that are connected to the same cellular network. While Duo may be aimed at FaceTime, I’m not convinced it’s going to convince iPhone users to switch to Android. But if it gets enough of a following, it could make it easier for iPhone users to at least consider making the move. Still, FaceTime, which debuted with Apple’s iPhone 4 back in 2010, retains some advantages over Duo. Apple offers it for Mac computers, while Duo isn’t available for the Mac or Windows PC’s. FaceTime allows users to place audio-only calls, while Duo is focused on video ones. And FaceTime users can connect to people even if they don’t know their phone number; FaceTime also recognizes their email address. Photo: Google Duo.

Google calls this feature “Knock, knock.” The app, announced in May, was released Tuesday as a free service for phones running on Google’s Android operating system as well as for Apple’s iPhones.

Many other services require both participants to have account log-ins to use their video calling options. Google has been offering video calling through its Hangout feature for several years, but the Internet company is now tailoring that service for business meetings. Duo is being billed as a simpler, more reliable way to see friends and family as you talk to them. It is the first of two new mobile apps that Google, owned by Alphabet Inc., has planned for this summer. The Mountain View company also is preparing to unveil a new messaging app called Allo featuring a robotic assistant that will suggest automated responses to texts.

GOOGL owned online search engine giant Google is scheduled to unveil its new video calling app, Google Duo today that has been developed exclusively for mobile phones running on Android or iOS operating platforms. The new app will be free to use and will compete with other video calling applications such as Microsoft Corporation’s MSFT Skype, Apple Inc.’s AAPL FaceTime and the Messenger app from Facebook.   ALPHABET INC-A Price ALPHABET INC-A Price | ALPHABET INC-A Quote What Sets Google Duo Apart? Knock Knock: The one differentiating factor that sets Google Duo apart from all the other video calling apps is that it has a feature called “Knock, knock” that lets the recipient have a glimpse of the person making the call even before picking it up. However, this feature doesn’t work on an iPhone because Apple doesn’t allow access to the lock-screen and one has to manually unlock the phone before taking the call. Simplicity: Duo has been created keeping ease of use and simplicity in mind. Therefore, it doesn’t require any account logins from its users to use its features. Just like FaceTime, it requires just a phone number to make a video call. Automatic Network Switching: The app is compatible with both Wi-Fi as well as cellular networks and switches seamlessly from one network to the other based on the best signal strength. Unbroken Communication: If the Wi-Fi network is weak, Duo will sense it and seamlessly switch to the phone’s cellular network. In the event, the cellular signal is low such as a 2G network, Duo will switch from video to audio automatically without cutting off the communication. What’s Next? Apart from Duo, Google is planning to launch its other new mobile app called Allo this summer. This app will make use of a robotic assistant that will suggest responses to text messages automatically. Our Take We note that Hangouts, Google’s already existing texting and video calling app, requires the users to create a Google account first. This proves to be an entry barrier for many users in the emerging markets. With the Duo requiring none of those formalities and some additional smart features such as Knock Knock, this app to gain popularity in the coming years. Moreover, while Hangouts will continue to address the requirements of an enterprise with its group video calling features, Duo is just a simple video calling app designed to meet day-to-day requirements of consumers.   Zacks Rank At present, Alphabet has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Resend activation e-mail Law & Disorder / Civilization & Discontents Privacy lawsuit over Gmail will move forward New plaintiffs hope to push ahead with a class of people who never used Gmail. by Joe Mullin - Aug 16, 2016 11:10 pm UTC Login to bookmark 113 cinefil_ Thanks to a judge's order, Google must face another proposed class-action lawsuit over its scanning of Gmail. The issue is a lingering headache for the search giant, which has faced allegations for years now that scanning Gmail in order to create personalized ads violates US wiretapping laws. In a 38-page order (PDF), US District Judge Lucy Koh rejected Google's argument that the scanning takes place within the "ordinary course of business." "Not every practice that is routine or legitimate will fall within the scope of the 'ordinary course of business'," Judge Koh wrote. Koh noted that while Google has to scan for other reasons, like virus and spam prevention, the company didn't have to scan for advertising purposes. She noted that in April 2014, Google "ceased intercepting, scanning, and analyzing, for advertising purposes, the contents of emails transmitted via Google Apps for Education." According to Koh, that shows that Google is able to provide Gmail, at least to some users, without scanning email for ad purposes. The order was published on Friday and first reported earlier today by Courthouse News. The ruling means that Google won't be able to get the lawsuit, which was filed in September, thrown out at an early stage. However, the plaintiffs are a long way from seeing a payday. Google will likely fight hard to defend the way it has long run its Gmail service. The plaintiffs still have yet to pass key hurdles, including forming a class, which proved impossible in an earlier lawsuit. Koh's order reviews the history of those earlier privacy cases, the first of which was filed in 2010. They were filed in various districts and ultimately consolidated in Koh's court as In re Google Inc. Gmail Litigation. While Google wasn't able to get that suit thrown out either, the individual plaintiffs all dismissed their cases with prejudice after they failed to form a class. In that case, Koh ruled that the question of whether the plaintiffs had provided consent to scan their Gmail needed "individualized inquiries" and couldn't be addressed as a class action. In the case Koh ruled on Friday, Matera v. Google, the plaintiffs are seeking to represent only users who do not use Gmail and have never had a Gmail account, but have still had the content of their emails scanned because they interacted with Gmail users. The plaintiffs in Matera say the scanning violates both the federal Electronic Communications Privacy Act and California state privacy laws.

CHEN Duo, Google's video-calling app, is an alternative to Apple's FaceTime Aug. 16: Google and Apple have battled each other for years for primacy over mobile users. Apple has proferred its superior devices, like the iPhone. Google has fought back with its Android operating system and a series of mobile apps that are more flexible and compatible with a broader set of devices than Apple's apps. Today, Google underscored that strategy with the release of its latest mobile app: Duo, a video-calling app that is a direct alternative to Apple's FaceTime. The app fits squarely into Google's playbook in mobile. Over the last few years, Google has increasingly offered its important software and internet services, including Google Maps, Google Photos and Google Docs, to iPhone customers. All those apps were compelling alternatives to Apple's proprietary apps, like Apple Maps, Photos and Notes, because they work on a wider variety of devices, including Macs, Windows PCs, Android devices and iPhones. Duo is no exception. People can only use FaceTime to call others who have Apple devices. But Duo lets you place video calls between Android and iPhone users, and sizeably increases the universe of people with whom you can hold a video conversation. "You shouldn't have to worry about whether your call will connect, or if your friend is using the same type of device as you are," Google said in a statement, in a veiled jab at Apple. "It's no wonder that nearly half of US adults never make video calls on mobile." All this feeds into Google's strategy to attract iPhone users over to Android. Google's apps generally work better on Android devices than on iPhones, so the more that people get hooked on Google's core apps, the less incentive there is to stay loyal to Apple. Nick Fox, Google's head of communication products, said the top priority with Duo was to build a great product and to increase the use of video calling among Android users. But he added that making Android more attractive to iPhone owners was a secondary motive. He said that Duo's appeal was that it was simple to use, fast and more widely accessible. "Our view is video calling should work for everybody," he said. "If you can only call half the people you know, that's very limiting." Apple does not profess to be worried by Google's moves. When the iPhone maker reported falling sales last month, Timothy D. Cook, Apple's chief executive, repeatedly highlighted that the rate at which people were switching from Android-based devices to iPhones was the highest the company had seen. "Our year-to-date iPhone sales to switchers are the greatest we've seen in any nine-month period," Cook said in the call. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment beyond Cook's comments. I decided to test Duo to see how the new app plays into the debate about whether iPhone users should consider switching to Android devices. After trying an early copy of Duo and comparing it side by side with FaceTime, I found that Duo was just as intuitive and fun to use as FaceTime, but that it was too early to tell which service was more reliable. First, a little context about Duo and where it fits into the universe of Google apps. The Silicon Valley company announced in May at its annual developer conference that Duo would be coming. The app is solely dedicated to video chats between two people, the company said, to make video calling simpler to access. This is not the first time Google has provided video calling. Google started offering mobile video calling several years ago inside its Hangouts app, which also includes messaging and voice-calling capabilities. The video-calling feature in Hangouts will remain intact. Crystal Dahlen, a Google spokeswoman, said the name Duo conveyed that the app was designed for one-to-one video calling on mobile devices, in contrast to Hangouts, which lets groups of people make video calls over mobile devices and computers.

STOCKFISCHTampa Bay Times Tuesday, August 16, 2016 9:47pm Print 0 My Edition I want to see more articles tagged I'm already following articles tagged ZACK WITTMAN | Times Mayor Bob Buckhorn and Google’s regional expansion lead, Brien Bell, spoke with students from the University of Tampa Business school in October after they announced Google Fiber was coming to the city. Those plans are now on hold. ﻿ TAMPA — Google Fiber's decision to target Tampa as a city to install its coveted high-speed internet service had the town abuzz when it was announced in October. Related News/Archive Google Express delivery service launches in Florida and Tampa Bay today 4 Weeks Ago Faulty router causing internet service disruptions for South Tampa Frontier customers 6 Months Ago Bright House customers: You now belong to Spectrum for cable TV, phone and Internet service 1 Week Ago Mayor Bob Buckhorn and local economic development officials hailed the gigabit-per-second offering, roughly 30 times faster than the U.S. average, as potentially boosting the area's attractiveness to tech companies, entrepreneurs and millennial talent. Now, Google's high-speed internet business is on hold. The Wall Street Journal reported on Monday that Google is reconsidering how to provide the service after initial rollouts proved more expensive and time-consuming than anticipated. "We're continuing to work with city leaders to explore the possibility of bringing Google Fiber to Tampa," Google said in a statement emailed to the Tampa Bay Times. "This means deploying the latest technologies in alignment with our product road map, while understanding local considerations, which takes time." Tampa is among a handful of U.S. cities being considered for the high-speed service. Russell Haupert, the city's chief technology officer, said Google is continuing its engineering review in Tampa and is still in the exploratory phase. The Journal reported that Google is now hoping to use wireless technology to connect homes, rather than cables. The search-engine giant's ultimate decision on whether to provide the ultra-fast service depends on a review of Tampa's permitting regulations and city and state rules that govern utility providers. Cities are also judged on factors like the ability to use existing infrastructure and the topography of an area. Tampa also will have to provide sites for "fiber huts," a shelter for communication equipment on city land. "We're in a holding pattern … but City Council has moved forward with the hut site locations, and we look forward to Google finalizing their exploratory phase in the very near future," said city spokeswoman Ashley Bauman. The council has approved four hut sites and has another up for consideration next month. That approval would fulfill the city's responsibility for providing the sites, Haupert said. Brien Bell, Google's regional expansion lead, came to the University of Tampa in October 2015 to announce that the city was among those chosen for further evaluation from 1,000 applicants for the near light-speed service. He said at the time that Google's interest in Tampa was due to its thriving entrepreneurial sector and because the city is working to bring connectivity to its poorest residents. Kansas City, Mo.; Austin, Texas; Provo, Utah; Nashville; Atlanta; and Charlotte, N.C., were the first cities to receive the high-speed service. Tampa is among 12 cities listed by Google as having the potential to receive the service. The super-high speed allows users to stream high-definition video content with little to no delays or buffering; improves online experiences for multiple users and devices connected to a network; eliminates disconnects and frozen images during videoconferencing, and cuts times to upload high-quality images to social networks or the cloud from hours or minutes to seconds.

Ford CEO Mark Fields announced the new goal Tuesday at the company's Silicon Valley campus in Palo Alto, California, sparking rumours it could sell the cars to Uber - which is already testing its self driving systems using the firm's vehicles in Pittsburgh. Scroll down for video  The car will initially be used for commercial ride-hailing or ride-sharing services; sales to consumers will come later, Ford CEO Mark Fields announced. However, he declined to say whether Ford plans to partner with Uber or Lyft in the ride sharing venture, saying 'all options are open and on the table.' 'This is a transformational moment in our industry and it is a transformational moment for our company,' Fields said. Ford's approach to the autonomous car breaks from many other companies, like Mercedes-Benz and Tesla Motors, which plan to gradually add self-driving capability to traditional cars.  Instead, Ford is taking the same approach as Google, which supports moving directly to self-driving cars once the technology is perfected.

Share this article Share 54 shares 'We abandoned the stepping-stone approach of driver-assist technologies and decided we were going to take the full leap,' said Raj Nair, Ford's chief technical officer. Nair says Ford will continue developing driver-assist systems, like automatic emergency braking or lane departure warning.  Ford President and CEO Mark Fields said the move was 'a transformational moment in our industry and it is a transformational moment for our company' as he revealed the firm will have a fully autonomous vehicle ready to provide ride-hailing or ride-sharing services by 2021. But making personal cars more autonomous is dangerous, he said, because Ford hasn't figured out how to make sure drivers stay engaged and ready to take back the wheel when the car encounters an obstacle.  Removing the driver solves that problem. Ford's vehicle will be specifically designed for commercial mobility services, like taxi companies, and will be available in high volumes.  UBER'S SELF DRIVING CAR PLANS  Google's self-driving car may own the streets on the west coast, but Uber has staked its claim on the east - meaning its nearly half million drivers may need to look for other work. The ride-sharing pioneer announced it will begin testing autonomous vehicles around Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in the coming weeks. The hybrid Ford Fusions, complete with Uber logos, will soon be seen mapping Steel City and testing its self-driving capabilities on public streets. Uber announced that in the next coming weeks it will be testing autonomous vehicles around Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in a car that 'should be driven by a superhero'. A hybrid Ford Fusions with the Uber logo will soon be seen mapping data of Steel City and testing its self-driving capabilities on public streets Included in the announcement is a photo of an all black hybrid Ford Fusions that is fully equipped with a variety of sensor, radars and high-resolution cameras. Not only does the San Francisco- based firm believe self-driving cars are the way of the future, it says this technology has the potential 'to save millions of lives and improve quality of life for people around the world'. '1.3 million people die every year in car accidents — 94% of those accidents involve human error,' Uber shared in today's press release. 'In the future we believe this technology will mean less congestion, more affordable and accessible transportation, and far fewer lives lost in car accidents.' Ford says personal ownership of self-driving cars will come later. The Dearborn, Michigan-based company also says it plans to double the staff at its Palo Alto research center by the end of next year to nearly 300 people.  It will buy two more buildings next to its current building in order to expand its campus, Fields said. Ford said it will make several investments and partnerships to speed its development of autonomous vehicles. 'Ford has been developing and testing autonomous vehicles for more than 10 years,' said Nair 'We have a strategic advantage because of our ability to combine the software and sensing technology with the sophisticated engineering necessary to manufacture high-quality vehicles.  'That is what it takes to make autonomous vehicles a reality for millions of people around the world.' THE RACE TO SELF DRIVING CARS: WHO IS UBER'S COMPETITION? One of Google's self driving prototype 'bubble' cars Google's self-driving car In 2009, Google started the self-driving car project.  The testing fleet includes both modified Lexus SUVs and new prototype vehicles that are designed from the ground up to be fully self-driving.  Google's prototype two-seater 'bubble' cars have buttons to begin and end the drive, but no other controls. An on-board computer uses data from sensors, including radar, a laser and cameras, to make turns and negotiate its way around pedestrians and other vehicles. Under the vision unveiled by Google, passengers might set their destination by typing it into a map or using commands. Apple's iCar A concept video reveals ideas for a futuristic-looking Apple car, with a wide dashboard display and smart capabilities. The video from ConceptsiPhone boasts that the 2020 vehicle design is 'more than a car,' with connectivity to other Apple devices. The concept by Luca Wrede shows a build that mirrors the minimalist design common to Apple products. A wraparound dashboard screen shows speed, traffic predictions, and answers calls. The vehicle can pull up Apple Maps, Safari, and Siri, which are indicated all on the interactive dashboard. The concept car can even connect to the Apple Watch.  LEECo's LeSEE China's LeEco has unveiled an electric autonomous vehicle that it says will surpass Tesla's Model S in 'all aspects of performance'. Dubbed LeSEE, the sleek pearly white sedan has memory foam seats, Knight Rider-style voice activation, an automatic driving mode and a steering wheel that folds toward the dash when the car is set to autopilot. This futuristic concept car was engineered to be a 'smart', 'connected' and 'automated self-driving car' and the firm hopes it will set the stage for a fleet of autonomous taxis.  Although Uber's competitor Lyft stated it is dabbling in self-driving taxis, it won't have anything to show for it until next year. The program will use Chevrolet Bolt electric taxis and 'included customers in a yet-to-be disclosed city' General Motors & Lyft's autonomous Taxis General Motors announced a $500 million investment in Lyft earlier this year as a joint effort to develop a fleet of self-driving taxis. Although the idea seemed like a distant dream, the duo has announced plans for a testing program on public roads by 2017. The program will use Chevrolet Bolt electric taxis and 'include real customers in a yet-to-be disclosed city'.   In addition to the testing program, Lyft is working on a new app that will be used for the autonomous cars.  The app is still a prototype, but will list the option for an autonomous car and there is a GM OnStar assistant to answer questions or report issues while you're en route to your destination.  This year, Ford will triple its autonomous vehicle test fleet to be the largest test fleet of any automaker – bringing the number to about 30 self-driving Fusion Hybrid sedans on the roads in California, Arizona and Michigan, with plans to triple it again next year. Ford was the first automaker to begin testing its vehicles at Mcity, University of Michigan's simulated urban environment, the first automaker to publicly demonstrate autonomous vehicle operation in the snow and the first automaker to test its autonomous research vehicles at night, in complete darkness, as part of LiDAR sensor development. Ford and Chinese search engine company Baidu will each invest $75 million in Velodyne, a company that makes laser sensors that help guide self-driving cars. Velodyne, based in Morgan Hill, California, says it will use the $150 million investment to expand design and production and reduce the cost of its sensors. Laser sensors — called Lidar, which stands for light, detection and ranging — can also be used in conventional vehicles as part of driver assist systems such as automatic emergency braking. Ford also said it has acquired Israel-based computer vision and machine learning company SAIPS for its expertise in artificial intelligence and computer vision.  It has also formed a partnership with Nirenberg Neuroscience LLC, a machine vision company that has developed devices for restoring sight to patients with degenerative eye diseases. UBER'S HIGH RESOLUTION MAPS  Most Uber riders know the pain of watching the tiny car in the app drive around in circles before reaching the blue dot. Now, the ride-sharing giant is teaming up with DigitalGlobe, a vendor of space imagery and geospatial content, 'to help identify and improve pickup and drop-off locations'. Using constellation sensors, the duo will access imagery and location intelligence to create high resolution maps of the area - giving drivers the ability to see exactly where you are.

Play it now! more GADGET REVIEWS Google's Daydream: The $79 headset that could bring VR to the masses Google's $79 headset is superb in terms of hardware - but is currently let down by a lack of apps. However, it has absolutely huge potential to finally bring VR to the masses. Welcome Home: Google's $130 smart speaker Google's smart Home speaker still has a lot of learning to do, and loses out to Amazon's Echo in some areas - but has incredible potential 'Not quite an iPhone replacement': Google's Pixel phone Google's Pixel handset is good, and boasts an amazing camera and smart assistant. It's the king of the Android handsets - but still not great. Xbox One S review: Console that will make your 4K TV shine Microsoft's Xbox One S has shrunk the giant console by 40%, and is stunningly designed console with 4K HDR capabilities - but comes with some caveats. The $1,000 wireless speaker that really IS worth the price: Naim Mu-so Qb review Naim's incredible Mu-So Qb takes you back to the good old days - where the music captivates and enthralls, rather that simply being something in the background.

Speaker that looks as good as its sounds: B&W Zeppelin Wireless review It's not cheap, but the $699 (£500) Zeppelin Wireless is perfect for the design conscious music fan. The iPad grows up: Apple's iPad Pro The iPad Pro is, for many, a real laptop replacement - and a way to combine work and play in a gadget that will last all day and won't break your back to carry. 'A glimpse into the future of the living room': The new Apple TV Apple says apps are the future of TV, and while its new $149 box does have some issues, its combination of streaming services, games and other apps make it the best way to make your TV smart. The end of wonky wifi: Google's OnHub It's incredibly simple to set up, and we found it tripled the speed of our home wifi connection - but at $199 is expensive.. The best all in one wireless speaker you'll ever hear: Naim Mu-so review It might not be a name familiar to the US market, but Naim is a legendary British brand hoping to make a splash with the American launch of its $1499 Mu:So speaker.

Google set it up to operate around your existing phone number. Unlike Apple’s FaceTime, Google Duo doesn’t care if you’re on iOS or Android. It also has an interesting feature called Knock Knock that allows the callee to see the caller’s live video feed before you answer. The video below demonstrates Knock Knock. Google Duo is “free,” and is available at the App Store and Google Play. [Update: as noted by @grempe on Twitter, Google Duo calls are encrypted end-to-end, an important privacy element to protect users from prying eyes far and wide. – Bryan] Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn Reddit 5 Comments Add a comment geoduck August 16, 2016 Might have to check it out. I end up using Skype most of the time because either the person I want to call isn’t on macOS or iOS, or even if the other person is on an Apple device FaceTime just won’t work. Since MS bought Skype I’d like to find another option and maybe this might be it. August 16, 2016 at 6:57 EST PM CudaBoy August 16, 2016 Again, Google leading the way with agnostic simplicity. Poor Apple can never think this way because of it’s own limited “sandbox”. As far as that tired pathetic “you are being data based without your consent” I say get a life. Every call you make on any device is captured by at least one party if not more. Do your research. If you have cable TV, every time you switch channels, every show you watch, all of your viewing habits can easily be traced. If you buy an item in a store via credit card, you are a piece of recorded data. If you think Apple doesn’t have a full bio on YOU who makes purchases from the App store or Apple Store or iTunes then drink some more drone-juice. Google seems to use their data to make better products just as Apple uses your purchasing habits to tailor product to you. August 16, 2016 at 7:27 EST PM furbies August 17, 2016 For the moment at least, it’s not available in the Australian iTunes store August 17, 2016 at 9:30 EST AM Imagestealer August 17, 2016 Also not available in Canada. Kinda strange that these major corporations (both Google and Apple) claim to be global in scope, but can’t seem to see past the U.S. border. August 17, 2016 at 3:01 EST PM Paul Goodwin August 18, 2016 “Every call you make on any device is captured by at least one party if not more.”. FALSE “Poor Apple can never think this way because of it’s own limited “sandbox.” The sandbox is their strength, not their limitation. Google makes some fine products. You just have to understand that they excel in part by being the nosiest company on Earth. August 18, 2016 at 7:45 EST AM Add a Comment Click here to cancel reply.

Related: new 16GB iPhones shouldn’t be a thing in 2016. Oh, and I specify iPhone owners because the popup window at the heart of the ad’s gag is iOS. Besides, Google knows the best customers use iPhones. Anyhoo, Google has a solution for this problem, the Google Photos app. With this app, your photos and videos are uploaded to Google’s cloud storage (where Google then pilfers them for information it can sell to advertisers). The company left that parenthetical bit out of the ad, but the ad is really good. Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn Reddit One Comment Add a comment jhorvatic August 9, 2016 Free until they change there plan on you. Why would I want to when there is plenty of room in the iCloud and my information is not pilfered and plastered all over the web. Also if Google is advertising this as free just wait 6 months to a year and they will be asking for a lot of money for you to keep those photos up there. Every free storage cloud that I ever tried would do this so I gave up on all of them and will not take that free bait anymore. So everyone don’t fall for it or you will be sorry.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    Google Tuesday released its new Duo video-calling app that seeks to compete with Apple Inc.'s Face Time. Duo allows users to place video calls between Android and iPhone users, effectively increasing the number of people with whom callers may have video conversations, The New York Times reports. Apple makes the iPhone, while Google created the Android operating system. "You shouldn't have to worry about whether your call will connect, or if your friend is using the same type of device as you are," Google said in a statement. "It's no wonder that nearly half of U.S. adults never make video calls on mobile." With the Duo app, Google seeks to attract iPhone users to Android, the Times reports. Google's apps generally work better on Android devices — in moves that seek to undermine loyalty to Apple and its products. Nick Fox, Google's head of communication products, told the Times that the company's objectives with Duo were to build a quality product and to increase video calling among Android users. However, making Android more attractive to iPhone owners was a secondary motive, Fox added. Duo's attributes are that it was simple to use, fast and more widely accessible. "Our view is video calling should work for everybody," Fox told the Times. "If you can only call half the people you know, that's very limiting." Apple seems to publicly remain nonplussed by Google's efforts, according to the report, based on CEO Timothy Cook's insistence last month that more people are switching to iPhones from Android devices than ever before. "Our year-to-date iPhone sales to switchers are the greatest we've seen in any nine-month period," Cook told reporters in an earnings conference call. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment further, the Times reports.

Now it's the No. 1 form of electronic correspondence in the US. But as traditional e-mail falls out of favour with a growing sliver of the population, Google has struggled to make its messaging tools relevant or introduce new ones that resonate with younger users. Now, Google is trying again with a new video chat application called Duo. The app works with mobile devices running Google's Android operating system and Apple's iOS. It runs on Wi-Fi and cellular networks, automatically switching between different types and speeds of connection and adjusting video quality. Duo also uses phone numbers, rather than a Google account or Gmail address, making it easier to call friends, family and other people already stored on smartphone contact lists. The company's existing video calling and messaging app, Hangouts, requires a Google account, which limited adoption, especially in emerging markets. Facebook's WhatsApp and Messenger, Skype - now owned by Microsoft - and Apple's FaceTime used phone numbers to grow faster. A confusing array of communication options has held Google back. It has two e-mail services - Gmail, which is the top e-mail service in the US based on unique visitors, according to ComScore, and Inbox; three text offerings, Hangouts, Messenger and the upcoming Allo; and now two video chat services, Duo and Hangouts (which offers texting and video calls). This scattershot approach, and Google's late start, is becoming more costly for the Alphabet division as messaging evolves from a simple way to communicate quickly into one of the next big technology platforms supporting digital commerce, advertising and new services powered by artificial-intelligence. "Google missed it because of the requirement that you needed a Google ID to communicate with others," said Ankit Jain, a former Google employee and executive at SimilarWeb, which measures website and mobile app usage. Nick Fox, a 13-year Google veteran, was tasked by Google Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai 18 months ago with fixing the sprawl. Soon after, his new team formulated a strategy and started building Duo and Allo. "Google sees communication as this essential human need, whether that's through text, a picture, calling someone or doing a video call." Fox said in a recent interview. This insight is a decade old and has guided Facebook's strategy since its inception in 2004. Asian companies, like Tencent Holdings's WeChat and Line, have grown into tech powerhouses by connecting people through communication apps and offering related services on top of their networks. ENTER THE DUO The app works with mobile devices running Google’s Android operating system and Apple’s iOS Duo also uses phone numbers, rather than a Google account or Gmail address, making it easier to call people whose numbers are already stored on smartphone contact lists Duo is a mobile app and only allows one-to-one video calling, limiting it as a consumer offering It constantly performs “bandwidth estimation” to understand how much video can be delivered So how is Fox going to catch up? Job number one is clearing up the bloated smorgasbord of Google communications services. Hangouts will be a workplace service, offering group video conferencing mostly via desktop computers and office laptops, Fox said. It will be integrated more with Google's work software. Duo is a mobile app and only allows one-to-one video calling, limiting it as a consumer offering. Allo, a messaging service coming out later this year, will also target consumers, Fox said. Google's Messenger is a basic text system, part of a group of services provided to wireless carriers that work closely with Android. The second tactic: Bringing what Fox says is better technology to the new services to catch up with rivals. Duo constantly performs "bandwidth estimation" to understand how much video can be delivered. If Wi-Fi weakens, it switches to a phone's cellular network. If a cellular signal drops as low as 2G, Duo will automatically cut video and maintain audio. Allo will use Google's expertise in AI to automatically understand texts and provide useful suggestions. Google will also let third-party developers create chatbots that will interact with Allo users through messages. That's already being tried by other companies such as Facebook and Microsoft. "First build a great product," Fox said, repeating a common Google mantra. "Once you get people to love it, they will share it with friends and co-workers and it grows." Google was late in other technology and caught up, Fox noted. Gmail started in 2004, more than six years after Yahoo Mail, but Google's offer of mountains of free storage won over hundreds of millions of users. Google's Chrome emerged in 2008 - over a decade after Microsoft's Internet Explorer - and is now the most popular web browser partly because of speed and frequent updates. Better technology may not be enough to catch up, Jain said. WhatsApp and Snapchat offered something useful enough to persuade many people to switch away from their existing communication service where all their friends already were. Duo's promise of video calling for everyone on Android and iOS is something that Hangouts already offers, but that didn't move the needle enough, he noted. "It's worth another shot, but having better tech can't be the only thing," Jain said.

Soon after, his new team formulated a strategy and started building Duo and Allo. "Google sees communication as this essential human need, whether that's through text, a picture, calling someone or doing a video call." Fox said in a recent interview. This insight is a decade old and has guided Facebook's strategy since its inception in 2004. Asian companies, like Tencent Holdings's WeChat and Line, have grown into tech powerhouses by connecting people through communication apps and offering related services on top of their networks. ENTER THE DUO The app works with mobile devices running Google’s Android operating system and Apple’s iOS Duo also uses phone numbers, rather than a Google account or Gmail address, making it easier to call people whose numbers are already stored on smartphone contact lists Duo is a mobile app and only allows one-to-one video calling, limiting it as a consumer offering It constantly performs “bandwidth estimation” to understand how much video can be delivered So how is Fox going to catch up? Job number one is clearing up the bloated smorgasbord of Google communications services. Hangouts will be a workplace service, offering group video conferencing mostly via desktop computers and office laptops, Fox said. It will be integrated more with Google's work software. Duo is a mobile app and only allows one-to-one video calling, limiting it as a consumer offering. Allo, a messaging service coming out later this year, will also target consumers, Fox said. Google's Messenger is a basic text system, part of a group of services provided to wireless carriers that work closely with Android. The second tactic: Bringing what Fox says is better technology to the new services to catch up with rivals. Duo constantly performs "bandwidth estimation" to understand how much video can be delivered. If Wi-Fi weakens, it switches to a phone's cellular network. If a cellular signal drops as low as 2G, Duo will automatically cut video and maintain audio. Allo will use Google's expertise in AI to automatically understand texts and provide useful suggestions. Google will also let third-party developers create chatbots that will interact with Allo users through messages. That's already being tried by other companies such as Facebook and Microsoft. "First build a great product," Fox said, repeating a common Google mantra. "Once you get people to love it, they will share it with friends and co-workers and it grows." Google was late in other technology and caught up, Fox noted. Gmail started in 2004, more than six years after Yahoo Mail, but Google's offer of mountains of free storage won over hundreds of millions of users. Google's Chrome emerged in 2008 - over a decade after Microsoft's Internet Explorer - and is now the most popular web browser partly because of speed and frequent updates. Better technology may not be enough to catch up, Jain said. WhatsApp and Snapchat offered something useful enough to persuade many people to switch away from their existing communication service where all their friends already were. Duo's promise of video calling for everyone on Android and iOS is something that Hangouts already offers, but that didn't move the needle enough, he noted. "It's worth another shot, but having better tech can't be the only thing," Jain said.

Google Duo Aims to Make Video Calling Super-Easy By Richard Adhikari Aug 16, 2016 1:09 PM PT Google on Monday launched Google Duo, a one-on-one video calling app that runs on iOS and Android. The app will be available worldwide in the next few days, said Justin Uberti, principal software engineer at Google. Duo switches from cellular service to WiFi, and transitions from high-speed to lower speed wireless service smoothly, promising to let users continue video calls irrespective of their location and service speeds, although video degradation may be apparent on slower services. A separate account isn't necessary to sign up for the app -- a phone number will suffice. Duo users can begin a video call with a tap. A preview feature called "Knock Knock" lets Android users preview incoming calls even when Duo is not open. It also allows them to preview outgoing calls. However, it works on iOS only if the Duo app is open, and it doesn't give iOS users previews of outgoing calls. All Duo calls are encrypted end to end. Jumping Feet First Into the Video-Calling Pool Duo is a barebones app, running only on mobile phones. It doesn't run on the Web via browsers or other desktop tools. "Generally, it's better to keep something like this very simple at the start," suggested Rob Enderle, principal analyst at the Enderle Group. "That way you can deliver something that works reliably, and then build up features gradually without breaking the platform," he told TechNewsWorld. Also, a simple app will "be easy to learn." In contrast, Skype runs on PCs, smartphones or tablets, as well as on the Xbox One, PlayStation Vita and several smart TVs. Google Hangouts -- which reportedly has upwards of a billion users -- runs on Windows, OS X, Linux and Chrome. It has an add-on for FireFox. It runs on iOS andAndroid, and it supports both one-on-one and group video calls. It also supports text, IM and SMS; integrates with Google Voice and Project Fi; and allows video overlays and effects. Video chat and IM client ooVoo links contacts from Facebook and users' phones, and lets them include up to 12 friends in the same session. It runs on Microsoft Windows, Windows Phone, OS X, Android, iOS and Facebook. Facebook Messenger's features include video calls worldwide, as well as photo and video sharing, voice messaging, group chats -- and in the United States, money transfers. "None of these apps are ubiquitous, and the best -- FaceTime -- doesn't work cross-platform," noted Enderle. "This provides an opportunity for a firm like Google -- with the right product -- to steal the market with some marketing." Where Duo Might Shine Skype is "a pain to use," noted Michael Jude, a program manager at Stratecast/Frost & Sullivan. "I would think Duo would be a lot more friendly ... for casual users," he told TechNewsWorld. "This could be a real challenge to Skype." Users who only want to make video calls might prefer Duo, because additional features offered by other services "complicate the interface and, if you're simply into one-to-one video, you don't want all of that anyway," Jude said. Further, Duo is platform agnostic, while Facetime runs only on iOS devices, he pointed out. "Conceivably, [Duo] would be appealing to totally mobile users who aren't keen to use something like Skype for video calling." Video-Calling Prospects Video calling may not become consumers' preferred means of communication any time soon, however. The technology was first demonstrated in the 1950s, was first showcased in the 1960s, and became very inexpensive in the 1990s, noted Enderle, but it isn't commonly used for three reasons: People are concerned about being spied on; They feel they must adjust their appearance before making or taking a call; and Systems still don't talk to each other very well or at all. "Two of these three things aren't technical, and Google is only partially addressing the last -- so I wouldn't hold my breath," Enderle said. "What we don't really need is another discrete video-call app -- we need universal video calling," said Jude. "I'm waiting for an operator-provided video exchange that will route video calls from any device to any device," he said. "Until video is a ubiquitous service that's platform and OS agnostic, it will continue to be essentially a toy with a lot of overhead." Richard Adhikari has written about high-tech for leading industry publications since the 1990s and wonders where it's all leading to. Will implanted RFID chips in humans be the Mark of the Beast?

Linux: Making the jump from Photoshop to GIMP Ubuntu 16.04: A desktop for Linux diehards Video How IBM's Watson will change cybersecurity How to make GIMP look and work like Photoshop The GIMP has long been an important app for those who need to create and edit images, and now there’s a way to make it look and work like Photoshop. Joey-Elijah Sneddon reports for OMG Ubuntu!: For FOSS purists it must sound like a heresy, but there is a method in the madness of trying to make Gimp look like Photoshop by installing the GIMP 2.9 Photoshop Tweaks theme. It certainly helps those switching to open-source tools. If a designer has spent several years using Photoshop they’ll be used to its layout, its app shortcuts, its tools. Skinning GIMP to look (and work) more like Photoshop helps switchers feel more comfortable, and lowers the learning hurdle that (naturally) exists in transitioning. On a more minor note it may be that some simply prefer the aesthetic of Photoshop, like its monochrome toolbar icons and simple window layout. Whatever the reasoning behind wanting to adopt the look, DeviantArt user DoctorMo has made it easy. He’s packed up some of best known GIMP Photoshop tweaks into one ready-to-roll bundle. More at OMG Ubuntu! News about the theme pack spawned a large and passionate thread on the Linux subreddit. Here’s a selection of comments from that discussion: Itsneverlupus: “I’ve never used Photoshop. But considering the endless complaints about the Gimp UI vs the lack of complains about the Photoshop UI, I think there must be fundamental differences. So I don’t believe a theme pack will bridge them…” Killallnarcissists: “I have mixed feelings about this. It could ease transition from PS to GIMP, but GIMP already gets heat because people expect it to be a PS clone, this would fuel those expectations while doing very little to actually make it more like PS.” Inactiveaccount: “I feel GIMP tries to fill the specific role that Photoshop operates in. I find people give it heat because they think it doesn’t fill that roll nearly as well.” Torontohatesfacts: “When it is being touted as the alternative to Photoshop and when claims are being made of it being able to replace Photoshop, the expectation from Photoshop users is that it would be a clone. No professional or heavy duty amateur designer or photographer is going to spend 4x the time to do what they can in Photoshop just so they can use GIMP for free.” Australianaccent: “GIMP doesn’t get heat because people expect it to be a PS clone that’s something people made up to defend a crappy product. GIMP gets heat because it’s a…product that misses several essential features for a raster editing tool such as something as basic as CMYK colours and nondestructive editing.” Comrade Jim: “I prefer GIMP over photoshop. The company that I work for makes all the GDs use gimp because they had to pay over $600 on licensing fees to use photoshop+windows (per machine). Pretty much every job recruiter I see online for GDs lists GIMP right next to photoshop as if they’re interchangeable. I’m a networked applications programmer my self so I never really have to use it. I feel sorry for people who are forced to use proprietary software.” Freetux: “SWEET! Damn, it looks beautiful and it is so easy to install this thing. I recommend it to everyone, this guy is amazing. The github repo is here : https://github.com/doctormo/GimpPs” Agent Squirrel: “GIMP isn’t Photoshop. Why is this so hard for people to understand, stop expecting it to perform like PS. It’s a different piece of software, noone is complaining that Corel X7 is not Photoshop are they?” Mgoerlich: “So, what is GIMP then? Sure, it is not Photoshop, but it’s the same type of application and in my filter bubble its biggest competitor in that field. Everytime when Photoshop is not an option, GIMP is the first thing people will recommend, at least as far as my experience goes. So it’s not that unfair to compare them. The unfair part is to expect a project developed mainly by unpaid contributors in their spare time beeing as professional designed as a project planed and designed by a big company like Adobe. If you take that into account, I’d say it’s pretty much a draw. I also want to say, that I think that all thoose people bitching about GIMP are just a prove of its success. If nobody would bitch about it, probably nobody would be using it.” Myworkreddit: “I see nothing wrong with the GIMP UI; it’s six in one, ½ dozen in another.” More at Reddit Google releases Duo video calling app for Android Apple has had much success with its FaceTime video calling app, and now Google is following in its footsteps with the Duo video calling app for Android. The official Google blog has details about Duo: Video calling is the next best thing to being with someone in person, but too often it can be a frustrating or complicated experience. You shouldn’t have to worry about whether your call will connect, or if your friend is using the same type of device as you are. It’s no wonder that nearly half of us never make video calls on mobile*. Today, we’re releasing Google Duo — a simple 1-to–1 video calling app available for Android and iOS. Duo takes the complexity out of video calling, so that you can be together in the moment wherever you are. Duo is simple from start to finish. To get started, all you need is your phone number and you’ll be able to reach people in your phone’s contacts list. No separate account is required, so you can sign up in just a few steps. From there, you can instantly begin a video call with a single tap. We designed Duo to feel warm and inviting, focused on just you and the person you’re calling. To make calls feel more like an invitation rather than an interruption, we created a feature in Duo called Knock Knock which lets you see live video of your caller before you answer, giving you a sense of what they’re up to and why they want to chat. Knock Knock makes video calling more spontaneous and welcoming, helping you connect with the person before you even pick up. More at the Google Blog The Wall Street Journal reviews Duo Hot on the heels of the release of the Duo video calling app for Android, the Wall Street Journal has a full review of it. The WSJ appreciated the simplicity of Duo, but wondered if people would want to install yet another messaging app on their Android phones. Nathan Olivarez-Giles reports for the WSJ: Duo, which is available for iOS and Android, has a single purpose: one-on-one phone video chats. There are no video filters, no group chats, no texting and no GIFs. Duo’s interface and setup are as bare bones as the app’s purpose. You sign up with just a phone number. On the main screen, there is one option. Tap “video call” to scroll or search your contact list for someone to call. That’s it. Duo has one feature called “knock knock” that sets the app apart from its competitors. If someone calls you using Duo, a notification shows you a video preview of the caller before you pick up. Seeing a video stream of your friend waiting for you to pick up is fun, but it wasn’t a compelling enough feature for me to try to convince dozens of people I care about to download another app. Duo likely won’t keep you from juggling multiple apps, either. Being freed of the myriad features packed into other messaging apps was refreshing for a time—when I wanted to make a video call. Without text messaging and group chats, though, Duo just isn’t as useful as its rivals that offer that combination. Google is expected to introduce a “smarter” text-messaging app this summer called Allo for iOS and Android, which together with Duo pretty much make up Hangouts. Google has done this before, breaking up its Drive cloud-storage service into separate apps including Docs and Sheets, for example. It doesn’t help that Duo can only be used on phones. I use a tablet daily, and I have laptops for work and personal use. If I want to video chat with a colleague at work or a friend while lounging on my couch with my tablet, Duo isn’t an option. Even if I wanted to convert to Duo exclusively, I’d need to keep around Hangouts and FaceTime (or both). If you absolutely desire a stripped-down video-chat app, and think you can convince others to download one more messaging app, Duo is good enough for a look. Just don’t expect it to replace your other messaging apps. More at the Wall Street Journal Did you miss a roundup?

Elyse Betters16 August 2016Apps Google Duo is a new iOS/Android app from Google It enables 1-to-1 video calls with people in your contacts Must verify your phone number to make calls All videos calls are end-to-end encrypted Facebook Twitter Pintrest LinkedIn Google+ Mail Comment Google is going after FaceTime and WhatsApp and other video-calling apps with its own solution called Duo. Duo is free to use and enables 1-to-1 video calls. It relies on your number, lets you reach people in your phone’s contacts list, offers end-to-end encryption, and has nifty features like Knock Knock, which lets you see live video of your caller before you answer. And it's super easy to use, because the app's interface is ridiculously simple. Here's how Duo works, including details about how to get started and whether its safe to use. Google Duo: What is Duo? Google unveiled Duo at its Google I/O developer conference in May 2016. It has described Duo, which is free and available for iOS and Android devices in the US as of 16 August 2016, as a "simple video calling" app for everyone. It's basically a FaceTime/WhatsApp/Skype competitor. Google Duo: How does Duo work? Getting started First, download the app for your iOS or Android device. Once you open Duo, you'll have to agree to Google's Privacy Policy and Terms of Service. From there, you can designate whether Duo can send you notifications and access your microphone and camera. Once all that is done, enter your phone number. Google will send you a one-time code via SMS that you'll need to enter into Duo in order to verify your number. You must verify your number because your Duo contacts will use it to video call you, which is similar to how WhatsApp works. You'll then be brought to the app's main interface: a screen that is split into two, with the top half showing you what your camera sees, and the bottom portion offering up a large video call button. When you first see this screen, you'll be asked to give Duo access to your contacts. Pocket-lint Video calling Every time you open Duo, you'll see the camera view/video call button screen. To start making a video call, tap the video call button on this screen (when you use the app later on, you'll also see quick-hit buttons for your recent and frequent contacts next to and below the video call button). A contacts screen will then pop up, from which you can search for contacts by name or number as well as invite friends to Duo. Your friends will need to install Duo for them to be able to video call you using Duo - which sounds obvious but is worth mentioning. OK, so once a friend has Duo installed, hit the video call button, then find your friend on the contacts screen, and tap his or her name. The first time you call, Google will tell you "Smile! Knock Knock is on", along with a notice that says your friend - if he or she has you as a contact - will see you appear on their phone while you're ringing. In other words, don't assume your friend can't see you while you're ringing them, because they can, and that could lead to some embarrassing situations. (Your friend can't see you while ringing you, though.) So, whenever you video call a friend, you'll see a screen that warns your video is a visible, then you'll see the name or the number of the person you're video calling, and an end button, all of which is superimposed onto a view of whatever your camera sees (likely you). When a friend calls you, and you happen to be using your phone, you'll see an incoming video call screen, which includes a view of whatever his or her camera sees, a name or the number of your friend, and buttons to either answer or end the video call. If you're not using your phone, you may simply get a notification that says a video call is incoming, but that depends on your notification preferences. Once you answer a video call, or if your friend answers your call, you'll see the actual video call screen, which includes a view of whatever his or her camera sees and five buttons. These buttons include a button to change audio source, a button to toggle between your front and rear-facing cameras, a mute button, a button/round thumbnail of your camera view (which you can tap to enlarge and thus minimise your friend's camera view to the round thumbnail), and an end call button. It's all pretty straightforward, to be honest. When you or your friend end a call, you will be brought back to the camera view/video call button screen, where you'll then see quick-hit buttons for your recent and frequent contacts next to and below the video call button. Keep in mind if you don't have someone in your contacts, the quick-hit buttons for your recent and frequent contacts will simply show their phone numbers, and tapping any of these number buttons will prompt you to either add the number to your contacts, start a video call, remove it from this list, or block the number. Pocket-lint Manage preferences While on the app's main interface (the camera view/video call button screen), tap the three-vertical-dots button in the upper right-hand corner. You'll then see options to go to Settings, Help, and Feedback. Tap the Settings option. Under this menu, there are several settings you can change, including the ability to turn off Knock Knock. You can also limit your mobile data usage, enable your phone to vibrate while ringing (Android only), unregister your phone number, and block numbers, among other things. Google Duo: Is Duo free to use? Yes. Duo is completely free to download and use. Google Duo: Can you disable Knock Knock? Yes. Duo has a feature called Knock Knock that lets you see live video of your caller before you answer. You can disable this feature under the Settings menu within the app (which we explain above in Manage preferences). Google Duo: Can you do group video calls? No. Duo is a 1-to-1 video calling app. Google Duo: Can you sign up without a phone number? No. Duo needs your phone number. The app lets you reach people in your phone’s contacts list. No separate account is required. Google Duo: Is Duo fast and reliable? Supposedly. Here's what Google has to say: We’ve built Duo to be fast and reliable, so that video calls connect quickly and work well even on slower networks. Call quality adjusts to changing network conditions to keep you connected - when bandwidth is limited, Duo will gracefully reduce the resolution to keep the call going smoothly. For video calls on the go, Duo will switch between Wi-Fi and cellular data automatically without dropping your call. You can start your call at home, and continue seamlessly even when you head out the door. Google Duo: Is Duo safe? Yes. Duo video calls are end-to-end encrypted. Want to know more?

See next articles See previous articles Site Navigation Site Mobile Navigation Advertisement Supported by Tech Giants Gobble Start-Ups in an Antitrust Blind Spot Deal Professor By STEVEN DAVIDOFF SOLOMON AUG. 16, 2016 Continue reading the main story Share This Page Continue reading the main story Photo Credit Harry Campbell Walmart’s $3.3 billion acquisition of Jet.com can be expected to sail through antitrust review, eliciting barely a peep of objection from the federal government. Like Facebook’s acquisition of WhatsApp, the Walmart deal will probably end up being another example of an upstart internet company being swallowed up to preserve the stranglehold of a giant. This happens because antitrust regulators are stuck in an outdated view of the world, while the internet giants are more attuned to their nascent competitive threats. The deal for Jet.com is just the latest defensive internet acquisition of an emerging start-up that will preserve the hegemony of a select few. Jet.com was created to take on the dominant force in internet sales, Amazon.com. Although traditional brick-and-mortar retailers like Sears are dying slowly, unable to adapt to the internet, Jet.com — founded by Marc Lore, who sold the parent company of Diapers.com and other sites to Amazon for $545 million — has been different. Continue reading the main story Advertisement Continue reading the main story Opening for business just about a year ago, Jet.com was able to achieve scale remarkably quickly, reportedly increasing revenue to more than $1 billion, with more than 3.5 million registered shoppers. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Yes, Jet.com has been losing money on every shipment, but remember that Amazon went years without turning a significant profit. Jet.com is still a minnow — Amazon clocks in $100 billion in annual revenue — but it is, as Investor’s Business Daily put it, “one of the few e-tail companies in the U.S. that’s openly challenging Amazon’s dominance.” And now it is being swallowed up by Walmart. This could be seen as a victory for competition. Walmart will now have a more dynamic management and brand to buttress its own internet sales operation, which trails Amazon by quite a distance. This will allow it to better compete against Amazon. The likely result is that competition in online retailing will eventually be a slugfest between Amazon and Walmart with everyone else thrown by the wayside. The problem with this narrative is that it cements the positions of Walmart and Amazon as the only players in town. This is the modus operandi of the big internet behemoths. They live in fear of new technology disrupting their businesses and killing them off. Antonio García Martínez’s recent book about Silicon Valley, “Chaos Monkeys,” tells how Facebook operates on the model of “we might die any day.” Mr. García Martínez was a Facebook product manager when the company faced its greatest threat: Google Plus. Facebook won because it enforced an ethos of all work, all the time, spurred by constant fear of extinction. Facebook and its elite brethren will do anything to make sure they are not the next Yahoo or Radio Shack, killed by disruption and failure to innovate. This translates into paying obscene sums for technology that might challenge their dominance one day. Video Walmart’s New E-Commerce Strategy Marc Lore, left, the chief executive of Jet.com, and Doug McMillon, the chief executive of Walmart, are teaming up against Amazon. By CNBC on Publish Date August 9, 2016. Photo by CNBC. Watch in Times Video » embed If you don’t believe this, there is a poignant passage in “Chaos Monkeys” where Mr. García Martínez notes that Mark Zuckerberg saw that there were two companies with “hockey stick growth” that matched Facebook’s own: Instagram and WhatsApp. Both were amassing users at an amazing rate and both were an existential threat to Facebook. Journalism that matters. More essential than ever. Subscribe to the Times Did Mr. Zuckerberg rev up the Facebook machine to try to outcompete them? No. Instead, he bought Instagram for about $1 billion and WhatsApp for an astounding $21.8 billion. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Today, Facebook is dominant, with more than 1.7 billion monthly active users. WhatsApp has more than 1 billion monthly active users and Instagram, more than 500 million. This is par for the course in Silicon Valley. Google bought Waze for $1 billion in part to prevent Facebook from getting it and in part to buttress its own dominant map technology. The result is that Google remains dominant with only Apple as its main competitor. For a time, the only other competitor to these two was Nokia’s Here maps, which was sold to a group of car companies in 2015 for use in driverless cars and has disappeared as a competitor. The result is a duopoly in map technology. Another Google example is YouTube, which was bought for $1.65 billion in 2006 and is now a constant stream of users for Google. Indeed, YouTube, with more than one billion active monthly users, is a top driver of Alphabet’s user growth. Billions of dollars are made in Silicon Valley by selling nascent upstarts to the giants. And the dominant players pay eagerly to remain dominant. That is what is going on with the Jet.com acquisition and perhaps even the $26.2 billion purchase of LinkedIn by Microsoft. Where are the antitrust authorities in all of this? The guiding standard under the law is that no acquisition should be allowed if it would “lessen competition.” Under the traditional view of antitrust, when Facebook, for example, tries to buy a company like Instagram, it can argue that anyone can start such a website. And there are other competitors like Google and Snapchat. And so this gets past the antitrust authorities, who seem more concerned with how the data will be used rather than the accumulation of users. Both United States and European Union regulators examined the WhatsApp deal, but it passed muster because WhatsApp was viewed as a messenger service, something where there was alternative competition. This misses the point that domination is all about users and views. Those companies with users and page views can dominate, and accumulating those users is everything, something only an infinitesimally small number of companies can find the key to doing. The antitrust system results in the increasing oligopoly that we have, where a few companies dominate major industries, accruing the wealth and power that go with it as potential disrupters are swallowed at birth, the way Cronus, the titan in Greek mythology, ate his young to prevent their uprising. Advertisement Continue reading the main story No one knows what might happen to Jet if it remained independent. Perhaps it would fail. Amazon is dominant and Walmart may truly be the only real competitor. The same could be said of any of these acquisitions of high-growth companies. So preventing this acquisition may result not in creating a competitor to Amazon but in the eventual death of Jet. This of course would leave its founder and investors much poorer, a true cost. The flip side of this risk is that the big tech companies continue unchallenged in their dominance. Perhaps it is time to rethink antitrust enforcement, and take the risks associated with a different view of antitrust that looks at potential dominance and at breaking up oligopolies. Rhea protected Zeus from Cronus, which eventually led to Cronus’s destruction. If antitrust authorities do not adapt and emerging competitors continue to be bought up, we should not be surprised of the continued dominance of a very few companies like Facebook, Google, Amazon and Walmart.

Club MacStoriesWeekly Extras MENU ABOUT CONTACT NEWSLETTER ADVERTISE SECTIONS APP REVIEWS LINKED STORIES iOS 10 WWDC 2016 Six Months with CarPlay The In-Between Macs My New iPad Pro Keyboard: The Razer Mechanical Keyboard Case This week's sponsor Daylite a business productivity app for Mac and iOS. Google Duo Launches By John Voorhees At Google I/O in May, two related mobile products were announced – Duo, a FaceTime-like video calling app, and Allo, an instant messaging client. Earlier today, Google began rolling out Duo worldwide to iOS and Android users. Duo is available in the US App Store now and, according to Google's blog, will appear in other countries over the next few days. I've only just begun to try Google Duo, but it seems to fulfill the promises made onstage at Google I/O, though with a few launch-day hiccups. Duo is limited to one-to-one calling and is tied to your phone number. As a result, unlike FaceTime, you won't be able to use Duo on anything but your phone. However, because Duo is on iOS and Android, you will be able to make calls to people on both platforms. Setting up Google Duo. Duo is extremely easy to set up and start using - all you have to do is verify your phone number and grant the app access to your contacts and camera. The app starts with a live view from the front facing camera. There’s a button to start a call and another that shows your most recently called contact. Settings are available from the familiar three dots in the top right-hand corner of the screen. Google says that video quality will adjust automatically based on the quality of your network connection. The most unique feature of Duo is ‘Knock Knock,’ which displays your video stream to the recipient of your call as it rings on their end. In my brief tests, Knock Knock worked as advertised, but if you don’t like it, the feature can be turned off in settings. I have only used Duo a couple of times. It worked as advertised on strong WiFi, but my subsequent attempts to make calls have failed, probably because the rest of the world is simultaneously trying Duo too. Given Google's infrastructure, I expect connection issues should settle down over time. Google Duo is available on the App Store as a free download. You can watch Google’s promotional video after the break.

Japanese consumers who don’t have credit or debit cards can participate in the mobile economy.” “Carrier billing represents another battlefield between Apple and its chief rival Google, and one where the tech giants are taking very different approaches. Google Play, the app store on Android devices, has been signing up as many global carriers as possible and now has mobile billing availability in 45 markets, including deals with Japan’s top three phone companies,” Levy reports. “By contrast, Apple has been quite deliberate in its expansion, starting in Germany with Telefonica’s O2 in late October, followed by VimpelCom’s Beeline unit in Russia five weeks later. On Monday, the rollout hit Switzerland through a deal with Swisscom and Far EasTone in Taiwan.” “Having seen positive results from its initial deals, Apple has several more countries in the near-term pipeline, sources said,” Levy reports. “Carrier billing has distinct advantages over plastic. Consumers are already paying their phone bills every month, so it’s much easier to add items with the simple tap of a button than it is to type in information from a credit card or link to a PayPal account.” Read more in the full article here.

Here's what's going on with Chromebooks in education today and how to pick the right one for you and the students in your life. By Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols for Linux and Open Source | August 16, 2016 -- 20:18 GMT (13:18 PDT) | Topic: Hardware Chances are the students in your family are already using a Chromebook. According to Futuresource Consulting, Chromebooks accounted for 56 percent of K-12 school market sales. It's not just elementary and high schools. IDC reports that Chromebooks sales are now well ahead of Apple Mac sales. Chromebooks are great laptops for school kids from four years to 40 years old. Why? Because Chromebooks are cheaper, safer, and faster than Windows 10 laptops and Mac laptops. For example, laptops are stolen every day. If your school work is in there, you're out of luck. But, if you use a Chromebook, it's no big deal. By default, all your papers, email, and notes are safe on the Google cloud. You can get your work back by buying a new Chromebook, then signing into your Google account, and you're back to business again. If you got your Chromebook from a school, Google has made it easy to disable stolen or lost Chromebooks. This makes them a useless target for any thief. Schools also have other reasons to prefer that students use Chromebooks. Google offers a suite of programs just for schools, called Google Apps for Education Suite, as well as a class-specific ChromeOS and Android apps, called Google Play for Education, and Chromebooks that come with Google Play for Education at prices ranging from $199 to $227. In addition, with a $30 management fee, schools can manage Chromebooks. By Google's count, for schools, Chromebooks have a 61 percent lower total cost of ownership over Windows PC. They also take 91 percent less time to deploy. Based on my experiences with both Windows PCs and Chromebooks, those numbers sound right to me. Why? Because, for example, Chromebooks require no anti-virus programs and automatically update with the latest patches without any trouble. The upfront price is right. Valerie Truesdale, technology chief for North Carolina's Charlotte-Mecklenburg school system, was quoted in The Journal: "HP came in with a bid that is about $220 per device, which is significant when you're trying to provision 32,000, price is key." Those same advantages work as well for you as they do for schools. For example, Chromebooks boot-up in less than 10 seconds. Generally speaking, they have great battery life. And, as the cash-strapped school systems have noticed, Chromebooks cost far less than equivalent Windows laptops, and let's not even talk about MacBook prices. Some people are still under the illusion that Chromebooks can't be used when they're offline. That's not true. I write documents, answer emails, read ebooks, listen to music, and watch movies on my Chromebooks without a Wi-Fi signal to be found. I'm just as productive on my Chromebooks when I'm offline as I am when I'm using Linux, Mac OS X, or Windows desktop without an internet connection. Besides, as a work colleague in New Zealand told me, "The schools here in New Zealand are heavy consumers of Chromebooks. They perform really well; no one has complaints, and the more adventurous students install Crouton [which enables you to run Linux on a Chromebook] and compile silly demo apps they download from wxPython, FLTK, or any given open-source framework site." In addition, on some newer Chromebooks, you can now run Android apps. With 1.5 million Android apps, I think we can safely say now that Chromebooks will do just fine for almost any use without a Wi-Fi connection. So, which is the best Chromebook for your school use? My recommendations are in the gallery below, but you might want to consider getting a used Chromebook instead of a new one. You see, it doesn't take much of a processor, RAM, or storage for Chromebooks to run well. Top five 2016 Chromebooks for school and... SEE FULL GALLERY 1 - 5 of 6 NEXT PREV Until recently, I was still using my June 2011 Samsung Series 5, the first commercial Chromebook. I only got rid of it because I didn't need it anymore. It's still working just fine today. While I wouldn't recommend getting a Series 5, even used 2014 models such as the Acer Chromebook C720P or HP Chromebook 11 cost only about $150 and run as well as ever. You see, unlike Windows PCs or Macs, Chromebook don't get cluttered with junk software or the remains of old, uninstalled programs. Additionally, Chrome OS is very lightweight. It doesn't require the latest hardware to work well. When considering a used Chromebook, you should also keep in mind that while clearing personal data off a Mac or Windows PC can be a titanic struggle, getting rid of personal information on a Chromebook is a snap. Just take the following steps: Sign in to your Chromebook. Click the status area where your account picture appears. Click Settings > Show advanced settings. In the Powerwash section, click Reset. Click Restart, and then don't sign in with your Google account. Whoever logs into the Chromebook next is its new primary owner. That's all there is to it. That means you can trust a used Chromebook to not have malware hiding on it. It also means that it's safe and easy to move on to another Chromebook when the one you're currently using doesn't meet your needs anymore. So, what should you be looking for in a Chromebook? Generally speaking, RAM isn't a problem: 2GB is enough, though 4GB is better but not necessary. The processor also doesn't have to be that fast. If all you're going to do is light web work, say Google Docs and email, even the slowest CPU will be fine. That said, if you want more oomph, you'll want to avoid ARM processors and look to the faster Intel CPUs. One thing you will want is 802.11ac Wi-Fi. Chromebooks can work without Wi-Fi, but they show to their best advantage with a fast Wi-Fi connection. Of course, if your school only still supports 802.11n Wi-Fi, you don't need to worry about it. Like on all networks, you can only go as fast as the slowest link. In this case that would be the 802.11n Wi-Fi's real-world maximum of 100Mbps. Storage? Don't worry about it. True, Chromebooks don't come with much storage. They average 16GB to 32GB of solid state drive (SSD) storage or up to 500GB of hard drive space. Don't worry about it! Chromebooks store almost all your data on Google Drive. And, by the way, whenever you buy a new Chromebook, you get two years of at least 100GBs of free Google Drive storage. You also can't run Windows PC or Mac-specific programs on a Chromebook. You can, however, run Microsoft Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) applications, such as Office 365, in a Chromebook. If you absolutely must run a Windows or macOS specific program, you can run them remotely with Chrome Remote Desktop or Chrome RDP. If your school uses Citrix for virtual Windows desktops, you can also run Windows apps from your Chromebook with Citrix Receiver. If you're going to take any of these paths, you want to use a Chromebook with a fast x86 processor and not an ARM CPU. The bottom line is Chromebooks are great for students and they are none-too shabby for any users. I've largely replaced my use of high-end Lenovo ThinkPads with Chromebooks, because they cost less and work better for my purposes. Give one a try, and you may become a Chromebook fan too.

Home Top 50 How To Magazine Franchise Events Subscribe 6 min read Marketing Bootcamp 10 Free SEO Resources Every Marketer Should Use Image credit: Shutterstock Jayson DeMers Contributor Founder and CEO, AudienceBloom Marketing Bootcamp 21 Simple Ideas for a Successful Small Business Saturday Marketing Bootcamp 5 Business-Blogging Mistakes -- and How to Fix Them Marketing Bootcamp Beat the Marketing Competition With Data Analysis ON-DEMAND EVENT STRATEGIES TO GROW YOUR BUSINESS Watch Now August 16, 2016 Search engine optimization (SEO) requires special attention to a number of moving parts, all at the same time. You need to know your goals, your priorities and your progress in each of a dozen or so different areas. And those targets are constantly moving due to internal and external pressure. It’s a stressful position, but fortunately, you don’t have to do all the work yourself. SEO is, at its core, a way to use technology to your advantage, and there are lots of technologies that exist to make that route easier and simpler to follow. Some of these exist as paid platforms, but there are plenty of free options for the frugal marketers and entrepreneurs of the world -- and they happen to be some of the best tools, regardless. These 10 tools are free, easy to use, beneficial and available to everyone: 1. Google Analytics. Google Analytics is the granddaddy of all free SEO tools -- and you can tell it’s good because it’s offered by Google itself. Completely free to manage dozens of different websites, all you have to do is install a custom generated analytics script on your site to start tracking tons of detailed information about your traffic, including where your traffic is coming from, the behavior it takes on site and even monetary factors like your conversion rates. It’s one of the best tools for figuring out how effective your campaign really is and ways you can improve in a number of different dimensions. 2. Google Webmaster Tools. Google Webmaster Tools is a nice complement to Analytics, providing you with more in-depth and technical information about your site’s current performance (as well as recommendations for changes within the search console). With Webmaster Tools, you’ll get warnings if your site is down or broken, or if you’re in violation of any Google policies. You’ll also be able to access information like how Google is indexing your site and recommendations on onsite SEO factors like your title tags and meta descriptions if they aren’t in order. Related: These 9 SEO Tips Are All You'll Ever Need to Rank in Google 3. Open Site Explorer. Moz’s Open Site Explorer has a more specific function than analytics, specializing in the analysis of inbound link profiles. Sometimes professed as the “search engine for links,” Open Site Explorer exists to help you uncover and analyze all the links currently pointing to your site. This is incredibly valuable for determining your domain and page authority growth, as well as spying on competitors to determine what SEO tactics they’re using. It’s best used as a way to weed out bad links and identify your strongest potential paths for backlink development. 4. Google Keyword Planner. Google’s Keyword Planner is meant for use with AdWords, but it works just fine for organic keyword research too. With it, you can generate tons of new ideas for target keywords and phrases, discovering information like search volume and competition level for your prospective targets. 5. Moz's Keyword Explorer. While it is beneficial, Google’s Keyword Planner isn’t perfect. Moz’s Keyword Explorer attempts to bridge the gap with a number of extra keyword research tools, such as more accurate information about factors like search volume and more concrete recommendations for which keywords to go after.

The free version of BuzzSumo doesn’t have all the bells and whistles of the full version, but it is worth using for your content strategy. Here, you can investigate the popularity of various content topics and discover influencers who can help support your campaign. 7. SEMRush. Again, SEMRush has both a free and paid version, but the free version is still helpful. Here, you’ll be able to investigate your relative SEO positions and your competitors’ positions, guiding your tactics in more competitive directions. SimilarWeb deserves an honorable mention here for these capabilities as well. 8. QuickSprout. QuickSprout offers the best free SEO audit tool on the web, so it deserves a place in this list. Use it to analyze your website’s SEO, traffic and competition metrics with the click of a button. 9. Spider View Simulator. Google indexes sites in its search engine through the use of spiders, or web crawling bots that scour the Internet for information. These spiders can be directed in a number of ways, both positive and negative, to form an impression of your site. For example, they may skip over an entire section of your site if you accidentally block it. Spider View Simulator allows you to see your site the way a spider would, so you can identify and prevent these problems proactively. Related: 6 Essential SEO Strategies to Incorporate in 2016 10. SERPs Rank Checker. Just a decade ago, search rankings were the number one indicator of SEO success, but thanks to Google updates like Panda and Hummingbird, keyword-based rankings aren’t quite as predictable, linear, or reliably valuable as they once were. Still, it’s helpful to see your ranking patterns for your target keywords over time, and since Google won’t offer you that information directly, your best bet is a tool like SERPs Rank Checker. Here, you can monitor your rankings for a number of keyword terms and phrases, and see how you stack up to the competition. Together, these tools can help you plan, execute, measure, and refine your SEO strategy in easier and more productive ways. There’s a learning curve with most of them, to be sure, and not all of them are going to suit your brand or your personal preferences, but each of them has something unique to offer, and since they’re free to use, there’s no risk in trying them all out. Experiment with these tools to see how they can best fit into your strategy, then use them regularly for the best effects.

New video calling app can ‘stay up’ on poor net connections; no separate account is needed Google Duo arrived on Tuesday, with the promise of simplified ‘one tap’ video calling on Android and Apple iOS platforms, and the ability to work better on low bandwidth connections. The application, which is being rolled out worldwide over the next few days, will compete with Microsoft’s Skype and Apple’s FaceTime. “All you need is a phone number,” Justin Uberti, principal software engineer at Google, said in an official blog post. No separate account is needed to use Duo. A distinct feature on the app — Knock Knock — allows people to see live video of a caller who is in their phone book, before answering. Early reviewers said this would help people look presentable before taking a call. The feature can be disabled totally, or callers blocked. Also, for video calls on the go, Duo switches between Wi-Fi and cellular data seamlessly, without dropping the call. Google had announced the coming launch of the app three months ago at its I/O developer conference, part of a set of apps to be released. Duo has been built with an emphasis on privacy and security, and all calls are end-to-end encrypted, the company said. “Video calling is the next best thing to being with someone in person. We have designed the interface to be simple, easy and welcoming. In places like India, it has been designed to adapt to network connectivity conditions,” Google group product manager Amit Fulay said in a statement. “Duo has been built to be fast and reliable, so that video calls connect quickly and work well even on slower networks. Call quality adjusts to changing network conditions to keep you connected – when bandwidth is limited, Duo will gracefully reduce the resolution to keep the call going smoothly,” the company said.

Follow TechnoBuffalo Google released Duo, its new video-calling app designed to compete with Apple’s FaceTime and Microsoft’s Skype, on Tuesday. Duo is set to roll out around the world over the next few days, but we managed to get it running and decided to give Google’s latest app a try. Here’s a quick breakdown of what to expect and our first impressions. Everything about Duo is designed to be as simple as possible, including the setup process. Beyond granting a few simple permission requests, the app also requires a phone number to work. That shouldn’t be an issue for most people, but if you don’t have a set number, you’re out of luck. There’s no way to link Duo to your Google account instead, at least not for now. Once you’ve created an account, you’ll be dropped you into a simple home screen dominated by a live view from your front-facing camera, along with two big circular buttons at the bottom of the display. The first is labeled “Video call” and pulls up a list of contacts already using Duo, along with the option to invite other people to download the app. The second button shows the name of the last person you talked to if you want to quickly call them back and bypass the contacts menu entirely. Of course, the most important part of Duo is the actual video chat, which seemed to work pretty well when I tested it with my colleague Todd. The audio sounded great, though the video on my end was definitely a little grainy (Todd said the video on his phone looked good so maybe it was an issue with my Wi-Fi). There’s also an option to switch from selfie mode to your phone’s rear camera. Tapping on the display brings up that option, along with volume controls and a mute button. Finally, there’s “Knock Knock,” Duo’s special feature that lets you see what the person who’s calling you is doing before you accept the call. We actually had a little trouble getting it to work. Todd said he just saw a black screen when I called, but when he tried calling me it worked perfectly. It’s possible Knock Knock still needs some improvement, but it’s pretty cool when it works. I could see it coming in handy if you get an unexpected video call and aren’t sure what to expect. This way you’re not going in totally blind. If you’re looking for a dead simple option for video calls, Duo is a solid choice. It’s easy enough to use that pretty much anyone should be able to pick it up without much help, and it’s fun too. The app will be available for everyone within the next few days, but if you know someone who already has it, you can ask them to send you an invitation now.

NYC Google manager killed on jog in Massachusetts Hundreds of people, including a busload of her Google co-workers from New York, tearfully gathered at Our Lady of the Lake Roman Catholic church Tuesday morning to say their goodbyes to Vanessa Marcotte. Leah Abrahams, her college pal from Boston University, eulogized her tragic friend — highlighting Marcotte’s volunteer work and her uplifting spirit, according to The Boston Globe. “You epitomize grace, light, humility and absolute magic,” Abrahams said. “You are the stuff dreams are made of.” Marcotte, who lived in the Big Apple and was in Princeton last weekend to visit her parents, was found beaten and burned about seven hours after she disappeared following an afternoon run on Aug. 7. Police discovered her body about half a mile from her mother’s home. Vanessa MarcottePhoto: Instagram Investigators said her bruised body, which was riddled with scratch marks and cuts, showed signs of a struggle and they have been looking for a male suspect with similar marks. “Her death should not be the headline story. The headline story the entire world needs to see and read is the love that she lived every day of her life,” Rev. Dennis J. O’Brien told mourners Tuesday. He continued, “Vanessa was living — living the dream that God had for her. A dream that did not include hate or violence or even death itself. She was living the dream in a superlative way to be all love in the heart of the world.” There have been no arrests in her violent murder, which came less than a week after a 30-year-old Queens woman was similarly slain. The NYPD is still hunting for the killer who raped and murdered Karina Vetrano, whose lifeless body was found by her distressed dad just off a running path near their Howard Beach home.

WordFlow worked very nicely on the iPhone, it had everything you would expect to see on a general keyboard — for example, it had a pretty sweet one-handed mode and a lot of customization options. Since then, the keyboard didn’t really get a lot of new features. Following Microsoft, Google also launched its own keyboard app for the iPhone — called the Gboard. Google’s Gboard was very different from Microsoft’s WordFlow, and it wasn’t a run-of-the-mill third party keyboard app. It had Google Search built-in, which allowed you to easily search for things like nearby places, GIFs, emojis and share them very easily — without having to open any other app. It was that simple. Microsoft is now getting ready to take on Google’s Gboard. The company is currently testing a major update for its WordFlow keyboard on the iPhone with a group of testers. The major update will introduce a number of new features to the app, which will put WordFlow ahead of Gboard pretty easily. In fact, the next update for WordFlow could possibly make you use it as the default keyboard on your iPhone. With the next update for WordFlow, Microsoft is adding all the search-related features which you’ll find on Gboard — this includes GIFs, images, and even emojis. Additionally, you will also be bale to look up nearby places, videos, facts, weather forecasts, and a lot more. Needless to say, most of these Search features are powered by Bing. There is also some other features such as the ability to search for contacts and share phone numbers very easily, which can be very useful. WordFlow will also support one of the best features of 3D Touch on the newest iPhones: the ability to move the cursor with 3D Touch. This is one of the main reasons why I didn’t use WordFlow as my default keyboard when Microsoft launched it back in April. And if you still want more customization features, Microsoft has some new themes coming with the next update, too. So, to recap, here’s the full list of features coming to WordFlow: Search for GIFs, images, and emojis to better express yourself Find Contacts – when you need to share that person’s phone number Look up restaurants, news, videos, facts, weather forecasts, and much more New predictions, including GIFs: icons that show up as you type along with word suggestions that can help you express yourself better. Control the cursor placement with 3D Touch Accuracy improvements, particularly around space bar, and in arc mode Support for iOS Text Replacement function New themes! Microsoft’s WordFlow keyboard certainly is one of the best third-party keyboards available on the iPhone. As for Android users, the company still doesn’t seem to have anything share for those using Android. And if you are on Windows Phone, you probably won’t be getting any of these new features on WordFlow anytime soon. Some links in the article may not be viewable as you are using an AdBlocker.

Google on Tuesday launched Google Duo, pitting it directly against Apple Inc.'s FaceTime, which allows video calls only between Apple devices. Duo will also compete with Microsoft Corp.'s video-calling app Skype, Facebook Inc.'s Messenger and even its own Hangout app. Duo comes with a unique feature called "knock knock", which lets a person to see live video of a caller before answering.  Google said video calls would work even on slower networks by "gracefully" reducing the resolution to keep the call going smoothly. "For video calls on the go, Duo will switch between Wi-Fi and cellular data automatically without dropping your call," Justin Uberti, principal software engineer, wrote in a blog post. Google, owned by Alphabet Inc., said the app would be live worldwide in the next few days.

Home Top 50 How To Magazine Franchise Events Subscribe 6 min read Marketing Bootcamp 10 Free SEO Resources Every Marketer Should Use Image credit: Shutterstock Jayson DeMers Contributor Founder and CEO, AudienceBloom Marketing Bootcamp 21 Simple Ideas for a Successful Small Business Saturday Marketing Bootcamp 5 Business-Blogging Mistakes -- and How to Fix Them Marketing Bootcamp Beat the Marketing Competition With Data Analysis ON-DEMAND EVENT STRATEGIES TO GROW YOUR BUSINESS Watch Now August 16, 2016 Search engine optimization (SEO) requires special attention to a number of moving parts, all at the same time. You need to know your goals, your priorities and your progress in each of a dozen or so different areas. And those targets are constantly moving due to internal and external pressure. It’s a stressful position, but fortunately, you don’t have to do all the work yourself. SEO is, at its core, a way to use technology to your advantage, and there are lots of technologies that exist to make that route easier and simpler to follow. Some of these exist as paid platforms, but there are plenty of free options for the frugal marketers and entrepreneurs of the world -- and they happen to be some of the best tools, regardless. These 10 tools are free, easy to use, beneficial and available to everyone: 1. Google Analytics. Google Analytics is the granddaddy of all free SEO tools -- and you can tell it’s good because it’s offered by Google itself. Completely free to manage dozens of different websites, all you have to do is install a custom generated analytics script on your site to start tracking tons of detailed information about your traffic, including where your traffic is coming from, the behavior it takes on site and even monetary factors like your conversion rates. It’s one of the best tools for figuring out how effective your campaign really is and ways you can improve in a number of different dimensions. 2. Google Webmaster Tools. Google Webmaster Tools is a nice complement to Analytics, providing you with more in-depth and technical information about your site’s current performance (as well as recommendations for changes within the search console). With Webmaster Tools, you’ll get warnings if your site is down or broken, or if you’re in violation of any Google policies. You’ll also be able to access information like how Google is indexing your site and recommendations on onsite SEO factors like your title tags and meta descriptions if they aren’t in order. Related: These 9 SEO Tips Are All You'll Ever Need to Rank in Google 3. Open Site Explorer. Moz’s Open Site Explorer has a more specific function than analytics, specializing in the analysis of inbound link profiles. Sometimes professed as the “search engine for links,” Open Site Explorer exists to help you uncover and analyze all the links currently pointing to your site. This is incredibly valuable for determining your domain and page authority growth, as well as spying on competitors to determine what SEO tactics they’re using. It’s best used as a way to weed out bad links and identify your strongest potential paths for backlink development. 4. Google Keyword Planner. Google’s Keyword Planner is meant for use with AdWords, but it works just fine for organic keyword research too. With it, you can generate tons of new ideas for target keywords and phrases, discovering information like search volume and competition level for your prospective targets. 5. Moz's Keyword Explorer. While it is beneficial, Google’s Keyword Planner isn’t perfect. Moz’s Keyword Explorer attempts to bridge the gap with a number of extra keyword research tools, such as more accurate information about factors like search volume and more concrete recommendations for which keywords to go after.

The free version of BuzzSumo doesn’t have all the bells and whistles of the full version, but it is worth using for your content strategy. Here, you can investigate the popularity of various content topics and discover influencers who can help support your campaign. 7. SEMRush. Again, SEMRush has both a free and paid version, but the free version is still helpful. Here, you’ll be able to investigate your relative SEO positions and your competitors’ positions, guiding your tactics in more competitive directions. SimilarWeb deserves an honorable mention here for these capabilities as well. 8. QuickSprout. QuickSprout offers the best free SEO audit tool on the web, so it deserves a place in this list. Use it to analyze your website’s SEO, traffic and competition metrics with the click of a button. 9. Spider View Simulator. Google indexes sites in its search engine through the use of spiders, or web crawling bots that scour the Internet for information. These spiders can be directed in a number of ways, both positive and negative, to form an impression of your site. For example, they may skip over an entire section of your site if you accidentally block it. Spider View Simulator allows you to see your site the way a spider would, so you can identify and prevent these problems proactively. Related: 6 Essential SEO Strategies to Incorporate in 2016 10. SERPs Rank Checker. Just a decade ago, search rankings were the number one indicator of SEO success, but thanks to Google updates like Panda and Hummingbird, keyword-based rankings aren’t quite as predictable, linear, or reliably valuable as they once were. Still, it’s helpful to see your ranking patterns for your target keywords over time, and since Google won’t offer you that information directly, your best bet is a tool like SERPs Rank Checker. Here, you can monitor your rankings for a number of keyword terms and phrases, and see how you stack up to the competition. Together, these tools can help you plan, execute, measure, and refine your SEO strategy in easier and more productive ways. There’s a learning curve with most of them, to be sure, and not all of them are going to suit your brand or your personal preferences, but each of them has something unique to offer, and since they’re free to use, there’s no risk in trying them all out. Experiment with these tools to see how they can best fit into your strategy, then use them regularly for the best effects.

Share Tweet Share Tags : iOS-iOS+ Apple-Apple+ Editorials-Editorials+ The idea that artificial intelligence is the next big thing in computing is pretty well established at this point. All major software companies around have said as much and we've seen the visions of big guns like Google, Microsoft and Facebook for the future of AI. Apple, however, has been a little more hesitant about making big proclamations about AI until now.  In an interview with the Washington Post, Cook made it clear that he understands the value of AI and also made it clear that he sees Apple as being a major player in terms of AI. When I saw the interview, I had to read it a few times to make sure I had read it correctly, because the idea of Apple as a major player in AI is completely incompatible with the privacy-focused version of Apple that Tim Cook has built.  At its most basic level, AI is a way to glean novel and interesting information from the huge amounts of data that we all generate constantly. Given this, it makes perfect sense that a company like Google -- whose stated goal is to organize the world's data, and a company built on gathering as much data about you as possible -- would make a big push into AI. Apple has consistently placed itself as the antithesis of that idea.  Privacy vs AI Apple's reputation is built on privacy. Cook has boasted time and again about how Apple either doesn't gather your data or doesn't gather it without multiple notifications and opt-in messages. Cook's Apple was even poised and ready to take on the FBI in order to protect user privacy. This idea of privacy cannot exist in a world of AI.  Apple is obviously going to try. It showed off Differential Privacy at WWDC as a way to collect data on users while still respecting privacy and this will work to a certain extent but in very limited ways. Differential Privacy will allow Apple to use some AI to make general keyboard predictions and autocorrections better and maybe even general predictions in terms of navigation for Apple Maps. But, that's the real issue -- anonymized data can only lead to general predictions.  The best promises of AI and the most exciting things we've seen for AI come from hyper-individual recommendations and learning. At Google I/O, the promise of Allo was to be able to instantly suggest relevant information or allow for searches based on what you had typed. The only way this would be possible is by allowing Google servers access to read that data (although Google will instantly delete the chat records). If you turn on the privacy focused end-to-end encrypted Incognito mode of Allo, those special features disappear.  At its best, AI can take data including your preferences, location, interests, habits, and history, mix in those same findings from others and offer you something that is either unexpected and interesting or helpful and timely, while being automated and seamless. At its best, AI churns through the huge amounts of data we create -- intentionally and unintentionally -- to find patterns that make every process easier, faster, and filled with added value.  Tim Cook may want Apple to be a part of that revolution, but Apple will be handicapped in the AI race as long as the company stands by its identity as the anti-Google that holds up user privacy by not gathering all of that data. Cook can certainly pivot and take Apple down the path of data gathering and AI, but that will be a hard sell to the hundreds of millions who have bought iPhones under the promise that their data was private even from the eyes of Apple.  Featured stories   LG V20 camera tips and tricks   When will my phone get Android 7.0 Nougat?   Best high-end Samsung smartphones you can get right now (November 2016)   iPhone 7 Plus vs $1600 camera: which takes better portraits?   Nokia's return to smartphones confirmed for 2017   Bezelless Galaxy S8 and iPhone 8?

Well-Manicured-Man (Posts: 342; Member since: 16 Jun 2015) I challenge this view. Artificial intelligence is about data interpretation and data presentation to the user but it doesn't mean that AI needs to know everything about you and it does not mean that Apple needs to have access to this data neither. Google wants to have access to this data because they want to make money out of you this way. Firstly, a good artificial intelligence delivers exactly what you ask her to do. For example showing certain information in a well structured way from the internet to the user. Secondly, of course this AI can gather data about you but it is not necessary that Apple has to know this data. What would be the value add if Apple knew this data? Why would this make the AI better? Privacy and AI do not exclude each other. posted on 17 Aug 2016, 01:12 2 Reply 11. Leo_MC (Posts: 1666; Member since: 02 Dec 2011) Exactly my opinion. Making a rudimentary comparison, think about fingerprint scanner in iPhones: the data is stored locally without acces from anywhere; the same could be true for other data: it could be stored locally or in an encrypted iCloud (where no one - not even Apple - except AI, has access). posted on 17 Aug 2016, 04:46 1 Reply 12. shahrooz (Posts: 763; Member since: 17 Sep 2013) " it doesn't mean that AI needs to know everything about you and it does not mean that Apple needs to have access to this data neither" that's why it won't be as good as other AIs. the more it knows, the better it works. "AI can gather data about you but it is not necessary that Apple has to know this data." google claims the same but apple mocks it, is it gonna be okay when they do this? Dude I'm restating the article again, did you even read it? posted on 16 Aug 2016, 15:34 4 Reply 2. Finalflash (Posts: 3169; Member since: 23 Jul 2013) I honestly don't know what Cook is smoking there. They're going to be absolutely worthless in AI. Under Tim Cook, there is no uniform direction for Apple or its various products. All he cares about is money and margins, which under him have been amazing, but so far the products have been meh and the sales and goodwill from Jobs' time are pretty much sustaining Apple and their growth. Once again, he claims that AI is their focus, but until Google showed their efforts at Deep Learning at IO (which was an amazing/scary demo), they weren't even talking about AI at a high level. So it seems to be more a "me too" reaction like MS last decade rather than their own inspiration (which is Apple as of late). They tried to buy their way into unique hardware advantages like sapphire and failed miserably. They're going to try that again with AI and probably have the same results. They just got around to opening up Siri to become useful, until now it was and still is sub-par. They have a "focus" on privacy but want to be huge players in AI, which is pretty much half assing it. They will apparently deliver something with the iPhone 7 that we "need" and cannot live without, but it isn't hardware because this year's iPhone is turning out to be the worst release yet. They're trying to flog the iPad "Pro" (and its 10 000 variants), with a keyboard, that makes it more bulky than a Macbook as a solution for the replacement of that Macbook. Haven't updated their laptops in years so they can push their most idiotic fans into buying the higher margin iPad "Pro" most likely. Haven't touched their Mac Pro for years but apparently they're focused on the Pro market. What is Apple under Tim Cook other than a headless chicken/cash milking machine? Once their cow (iPhone) dries up and their iFans wisen up (no where to go but up), will they be able to sustain their BS? posted on 16 Aug 2016, 16:39 3 Reply 3. kiko007 (Posts: 3074; Member since: 17 Feb 2016) Techie would be proud :D. posted on 16 Aug 2016, 16:49 0 Reply 5.

TechieXP1969 (Posts: 10535; Member since: 25 Sep 2013) Proud of what. I'm not familiar with Google IO that he spoke of. But I had plan to research why Tim Cook talked about AI, when PA first posted it. I won't comment on Apples hardware because I share some of his sentiments. I don't know ow what Apple is doing. First Cook says the next iPhone is going ro have thibgs you never thought you could be without, which I assets are software improvements, b3cause so far the leaked hardware has not shown pro.ise, other than the dual camera. Then Apple was a TV, and they want to be in cars, then the iPad Pro is suppose to be able to reach a laptop, yet they claim the Surface was tweeible at being a tablet and a laptop, while the iPad is the one actually terrible at it. Yet they raised the price. If Verizon didn't sell me the Pro model for the price of the Air 2, I wouldn't even have gotten it. It is a waste of money. I should have followed by first intention which was to get a Surface Book. IVE is doing nothing with design. I don't know how you can improve AI with to little.of data. Sorry it isn't going ro work. Apple does need an alternative to the iPad and iPhone because those are going ro drop every year. By 2020 Apple will.probably be selling less than 100M iPhones a year at this rate. They need to make some shear over to provide another fad product. posted on 16 Aug 2016, 23:04 1 Reply 9.

Are you sure? While I'm not an Apple walled garden fan, I was a fan of their FBI privacy stance. Normally I would agree with your article but I feel like it is lacking some basic framework for the argument. In your mind AI exists in the cloud and data sent to the cloud in any fashion is unsafe. But who says AI can't be on your device? I would welcome a more private approach to AI that is local. I would also argue that when you do your own search for whatever it is you need, that information is also being transmitted in a similar fashion as with AI to the internet to return you a result. In some cases having a massive cloud based AI that communicates with thousands of anonymous clients over a secure connection may serve to further protect individual users as long as the AI is essentially a VPN with intelligence. Design it to only work once the device sending the data has sent a key and destroy the key after processing the request. I think there are ways to do this securely and I would hope Apple and Google could both find better ways to implement and improve AI. posted on 18 Aug 2016, 01:27 0 Reply 14. roscuthiii (Posts: 2225; Member since: 18 Jul 2010) The "I" in AI stands for "intelligence"... a learning computer. If you destroy the data after every use, there is nothing learned. You don't have AI - All you've achieved is a basic tokenized Google search. I suppose having all the learning done locally would be an option... someday. But, to my knowledge, no personal computer comes evenclose to that capability yet. You'd need a supercomputer, which resemble server farms, or some kind of sci-fi quantum computer. posted on 16 Aug 2016, 22:27 1 Reply 8. tedkord (Posts: 12153; Member since: 17 Jun 2009) Always good to see Mr. Heller here.

The roll-out began on Tuesday and should be available in India over the next few days, says Google in its blog. Google’s catchline is that the Duo will take the “complexity out of video calling.” Explaining what this means to India, Amit Fuly, Google’s Group Product Manager, had this to say: “In places like India, it has been designed to adapt to the network connectivity conditions.” The blog says the video calls through Duo will work well even on slower networks. “Call quality adjusts to changing network conditions to keep you connected. “When bandwidth is limited, Duo will reduce the resolution to keep the call going smoothly. For video calls on the go, Duo will switch between Wi-Fi and cellular data automatically without dropping your call.” To get started, all that is required is a phone number. All the people in the phone’s contacts list across device types and platforms could then be reached without creating a separate account. A video call can be instantly triggered with a single tap, the blog post explains. Knock Knock feature A key feature of the app is ‘Knock Knock’ that allows people to see live video of the caller before they answer, helping users connect with the person even before they pick up. Knock Knock will make calls “feel more like an invitation rather than an interruption.” On the Play Store, the app window currently shows a “Coming Soon” notice. But users could ‘pre-register’ Google Duo to get notified once the application is available in India. Globally, the app will go live in 78 languages. Going the WhatsApp way, Google says it has incorporated end-to-end encryption of all Duo calls to ensure privacy and security. Both the caller and receiver will have to download the app on their smartphones to make the video call work. The app lets you to mute your voice. Besides, you could see how you look to the other person, a feature that is also available in Skype. There is a shortcut feature in Duo. A call is initiated by just tapping on pictured circles that represent contacts who were recently called. Google had first made an announcement about Duo at its I/O developer conference three months ago.  A market for video-calling and messaging feature in apps is still evolving since data charges are high and networks remain unstable, notably in India.

According to a report stemming from Engadget, Hangouts is set to still be around following the rollout of Duo, though the app’s focus will shift to enterprise users. This is in line with a statement the search giant made during an interview with Business Insider, wherein a spokesperson for Google said the company will continue “to invest in Hangouts and it will remain a standalone product.” With Google+ slowly becoming less important to Google’s apps — at one point the Facebook and Twitter competitor acted as the central hub for most of the tech giant’s apps — the company’s chat app strategy increasingly continues to make less sense. The live version of Hangouts, however, called Hangouts On Air, will be phased out of Google+ and transition to YouTube Live starting September 12th. Because Hangouts is available on iOS and Android, as well as desktop, the chat platform still holds a significant advantage over mobile-only Duo and Allo, though with the launch of two more platforms, Google’s app ecosystem is even more confusing. Duo is currently rolling out worldwide and should be available in Canada soon. SourceEngadget, Business Insider ViaAndroid Authority TomsDisqusted Very relieved to hear that. Hangouts does so much more then Allo/Duo – for one thing, it’s the best quality VoIP app I’ve found, that just happens to allow VoIP calls to regular phone numbers for free. deltatux Will be keeping Hangouts until Google kicks me off. Don’t see why I would want Allo or Duo. Hangouts does what both already do minus the chatbots which I honestly don’t care about. Even if Google kicks me off Hangouts, I can easily stick with Wire, WhatsApp and Skype. There’s really no reason to go to Allo and/or Duo. Ipse Same here…but knowing Goobble they will screw up Hangouts. God, does this company focus ON ANYTHING? They shift direction faster than the confused users can follow.

Starting Tuesday, customers of KDDI, Japan's second-largest mobile phone company, have the option in the Apple App Store to pay by mobile, said the sources, who asked not to be named because the deal hasn't been announced. Japanese consumers who don't have credit or debit cards can participate in the mobile economy. Carrier billing represents another battlefield between Apple and its chief rival Google, and one where the tech giants are taking very different approaches. Google Play, the app store on Android devices, has been signing up as many global carriers as possible and now has mobile billing availability in 45 markets, including deals with Japan's top three phone companies. By contrast, Apple has been quite deliberate in its expansion, starting in Germany with Telefonica's O2 in late October, followed by VimpelCom's Beeline unit in Russia five weeks later. On Monday, the rollout hit Switzerland through a deal with Swisscom and Far EasTone in Taiwan. "Something previously reserved for Android users is now available to millions of Apple customers via Swisscom," the Bern-based carrier said in a press release. "As a result of an extensive collaboration, they can as of now easily pay for digital content in the App Store and on iTunes, Apple Music, iBooks and Apple TV via their mobile phone bills." Having seen positive results from its initial deals, Apple has several more countries in the near-term pipeline, sources said. With iPhone sales slowing, Apple is touting its growth opportunity in software and services, and the revenue potential from games, music subscriptions, books and cloud storage. Apple carrier billing deals Market Carrier Date Subscribers (mlns) Germany Telefónica O2 Oct. 2015 9.4 Russia VimpelCom Beeline Dec. 2015 57.7 Switzerland Swisscom Aug. 2016 6.6 Taiwan Far Eastone Aug. 2016 7.4 Japan KDDI Aug. 2016 46.6 Source: Company reports Japan is a critical market for Apple because it's among the countries where consumers are most comfortable with mobile payments. According to research firm Ovum, carrier billing accounts for 70 percent of purchases on Google Play in Japan and South Korea. Only in those two countries has carrier billing reached far beyond digital goods and into physical products for "low-value items such as snacks, drinks and phone accessories," Ovum said. But games are the key. Japan is the world's biggest mobile gaming market, with consumers flocking to apps like Puzzles & Dragons from GungHo Online Entertainment, Fate/Grand Order from Aniplex and, of course, Pokemon Go. Games on phones produced about $6.2 billion in revenue last year, according to SuperDataResearch, $1 billion more than in China. With 46.6 million subscribers, KDDI is bigger than SoftBank in Japan and smaller than NTT Docomo. KDDI didn't immediately respond to a request left before the opening of business in Tokyo. CNBC.com also put in requests for comment to SoftBank and NTT Docomo to see if they too are rolling out carrier billing, but we haven't heard back. Apple hasn't yet offered a comment. Carrier billing has distinct advantages over plastic. Consumers are already paying their phone bills every month, so it's much easier to add items with the simple tap of a button than it is to type in information from a credit card or link to a PayPal account. For app makers, musicians and other content creators, that means more completed transactions. show chapters No headphone jack? Here's what we know about the iPhone 7    Tuesday, 9 Aug 2016 | 9:00 AM ET | 02:33 Apple has a separate page on its website, describing how to set up mobile billing on an iPhone, iPad or iPod touch, or in iTunes from a computer. "If your carrier supports it, you can pay for your iTunes Store, App Store, and iBooks Store purchases and your Apple Music membership through mobile phone billing," the web page says. It also notes that "mobile phone billing is currently available with select carriers in Germany, Russia, Switzerland and Taiwan." The rates that carriers charge per transaction are higher than the average credit card fee, but they've come way down in recent years into the single digits. In the top markets, carrier billing adds enough volume to make up for the loss in margin. Like other big platforms, Microsoft has been bolstering its roster of global carrier partners. Last week, the world's biggest software maker said that carrier billing is available across Windows 10 devices in the U.K. with O2 and in Italy with Wind. Meanwhile, Google made a big splash in May, signing its first carrier deal in India with Idea Cellular. As Apple plays catch-up, expect to hear of several more rollouts in the coming weeks and months.

New app aims to make video calling easy; also works in poor network conditions in India. Tech giant Google has launched its video calling app, Google Duo, for Android and iOS users, which will compete with apps like FaceTime and Skype. The video calling app, which was first announced by Google three months ago at its I/O developer conference, aims to take the “complexity out of video calling”. “Video calling is the next best thing to being with someone in person. We have designed the interface to be simple, easy and welcoming. “In places like India, it has been designed to adapt to the network connectivity conditions. We hope to make the experience of video calling more personal, inviting easy and smooth,” Google Group Product Manager Amit Fulay said in a statement. The rollout of Duo for Android and iOS starts today, and it will be live worldwide in the next few days. To ensure privacy and security, all Duo calls are end-to-end encrypted. Duo allows users to connect using their phone number without a separate username/account. Google has introduced a new feature ‘Knock Knock’ that allows people to see live video of the caller before they answer, helping users connect with the person even before they even pick up. “Duo has been built to be fast and reliable, so that video calls connect quickly and work well even on slower networks. “Call quality adjusts to changing network conditions to keep you connected when bandwidth is limited, Duo will gracefully reduce the resolution to keep the call going smoothly,” Google said. For video calls on the go, Duo can switch between Wi-Fi and cellular data automatically without dropping the call. The app like FaceTime for iPhones, only requires a person’s phone number to connect. Many other services require both participants to have account logins to use their video calling options. Google has been offering video calling through its Hangout feature, but the internet company is now tailoring that service for business meetings.

This latest offer from the tech giant is focused on simplicity. The app only supports video calls between two people and does little else. With the market already saturated with similar services, it will be interesting to see whether Google will be able to get this one to stick. Here’s how Duo stacks up against its rivals: Google Duo Availability: The Google Duo app can be downloaded for free on Android and iOS devices. Convenience: You just need to input a phone number and give the app access to your address book. It isn’t connected to any of Google’s other communication services, and because it’s so new you’ll likely have to request that a friend download the app before you can call them through it. Performance: If you’re moving around it will automatically switch between Wi-Fi and cellular data without dropping the call. There is also a “Knock Knock” feature that allows you to see the caller before you answer. FaceTime Availability: Available for free on Apple products—iPhones, iPads, iPod Touches, and Mac computers. Convenience: Using this feature requires an Apple ID and an email address which, if you’re using an Apple product, you likely already have. It works with your address book rather than having to make a call through a separate app. If you receive a call, you can answer on any one of your Apple devices. Performance: You can easily switch between voice calls and video calls, and adjust the view from portrait to landscape or from front camera to rear camera. Skype Availability: Skype can be downloaded on most mobile devices—Android, iPhone, Windows Phone, BlackBerry, Amazon Fire Phone, and iPod Touch. It’s also available on various tablets, Android Wear, Apple Watch, and Xbox One. Convenience: You can link your Skype account to Outlook and GroupMe. Skype-to-Skype calls, group calls, and instant messaging are free. You can either pay as you go or buy a subscription to access other features including calls to mobile phones and landlines. Performance: You can add up to 25 people to a group call and, unlike Google Duo and FaceTime, can instant message during a video session. Skype also offers screen sharing, call forwarding, voice messages, and a translator. Facebook Messenger Availability: Video calling is available through Messenger to anyone with a Facebook account. It works on three browsers—Firefox, Google Chrome, and Opera. Convenience: Video calling works both on a web browser and through Facebook’s mobile Messenger app. Performance: Unlike FaceTime and Google Duo, Facebook recently announced that group calls of up to 50 people are now available through the service.

Google Duo is just a creepier FaceTime Written by Ananya Bhattacharya Obsession Messaging August 16, 2016 Nobody's home, Google. (Reuters/Morris Mac) Share Written by Ananya Bhattacharya Obsession Messaging August 16, 2016 Google’s FaceTime killer seems more like a rip-off than an innovation. Today (Aug. 16) Google announced a new video-calling app called Duo that doesn’t seem all that different to its predecessors. The app opens with a split-screen of your image and a button to initiate calls, with your recently called contacts listed next to it. Unlike Apple’s FaceTime, Duo works across Android and iOS devices. “You shouldn’t have to worry about whether your call will connect, or if your friend is using the same type of device as you are,” the company writes in a blog post. Google’s main innovative feature is “Knock Knock ,” which lets you see live video of your caller before you answer, unlike Apple’s FaceTime. Google calls this “more like an invitation rather than an interruption” and “spontaneous and welcoming.” The Snapchat-esque live video calling feature is actually pretty creepy. There’s little added value in someone seeing you before they answer your call since the only people who can utilize the feature are people in your contact list. Apple blocks the Google app from accessing its devices’ screens, so iPhone users only get an incoming call notification without the video. Android users can opt out of the feature via the app’s settings. Google says Duo is “simple from start to finish” because it can directly access people in your phone’s contacts list. FaceTime also does this. Google also says the app is “fast and reliable” and allows people to seamlessly transition from wifi to cellular networks. However, that only matters in poor conditions. Google’s approach came to light at this year’s I/O conference in May, when the Mountain View, California, giant announced Duo alongside chat-focused app Allo, which is yet to be released. Even if Apple users are enticed by the cross-platform functionality–they can only make Apple-to-Apple FaceTime calls– Google still has to win over Android consumers—that’s over 80% of the worldwide smartphone market—who can use Microsoft’s Skype and Google’s own Hangouts. Plus, these platforms offer file transfers, text messaging and group calling, in addition to one-on-one calls, so “Knock Knock” won’t be enough to convert them to Duo users.

Google is developing a new, non-Linux based operating system Google is working on a new operating system called Fuchsia, designed for devices on the Internet of Things (Android Police). The project's description on its own GitHub page is enigmatic: "Pink + Purple == Fuchsia (a new Operating System)". Unlike Android and ChromeOS, it's not based on Linux. Further investigation reveals a lightweight operating system built for 32-bit and 64-bit ARM CPUs of the sort used by almost every mobile and IoT device, that can also run on standard PCs. Google's Travis Geiselbrecht has also confirmed that it'll soon be out for the ARM-based Raspberry Pi 3.

Sage customers hit by data breach British accounting software firm Sage, which provides cloud-based as well as desktop versions of its enterprise financial packages, reports that it has suffered a data breach that may have exposed the personal details of staff at 280 businesses across the UK (BBC). Police are investigating and the Information Commissioner's Office, responsible for enforcing the Data Protection Act, has been informed. A representative from Sage said that "we are investigating unauthorised access to customer information using an internal login." 3. Airlander's first flight delayed The maiden flight of Hybrid Air Vehicles' Airlander 10 airship, set to be the longest aircraft ever to take to the skies, has been delayed following a "technical issue" (Evening Standard). Due to have taken off yesterday from Cardington Airfield in Bedfordshire, the organiser of the test flight told the Evening Standard that, once the issue had been resolved, there wasn't enough time left to complete the test before dark. A new test flight date has yet to be confirmed, but Hybrid Air Vehicles tweeted that "the weather window is against us over the next few days, so First Flight will not be for a number of days yet." 4. SpaceX notches up another perfect landing SpaceX has successfully landed a sixth Falcon 9 rocket on a drone ship at sea, following the launch of a Japanese communications satellite (The Verge). The landing was particularly challenging, due to the great height and large amount of fuel required to get the geostationary satellite into orbit, leaving the rocket with little left to control its descent. SpaceX has now landed six of its 11 Falcon 9 boosters, although it has yet to reuse any of them: a key element of its future business plan.

Temporary tattoo turns your skin into circuitry Working with Microsoft Research, a team of MIT researchers, led by Cindy Hsin-Liu Kao, have developed an attractive and non-invasive form of biohacking that lets you control electronic devices using your own skin (Motherboard). DuoSkin's fabrication technique involves printing circuits using gold leaf to create surprisingly beautiful temporary tattoos that can be used as functional user interface devices, including "buttons, sliders, and 2D trackpads". The technology uses NFC to take power from and communicate with hardware such as mobile phones. 6. Apple has plans for augmented reality Speaking in an inteview with The Washington Post, Apple CEO Tim Cook has confirmed that the company is working on augmented reality projects (VentureBeat). He didn't go into detail, noting only that "I think AR is extremely interesting and sort of a core technology" and that "yes, it’s something we’re doing a lot of things on." Cook also discussed Apple's future use of artificial intelligence and its implications for user privacy. 7. The Great Barrier Reef will cost £4.8 billion to save A new report from the Queensland Water Science Taskforce in Australia concludes that it's still possible to save Australia's Great Barrier Reef, even after a bleaching event earlier this year that affected up to 90 per cent of the reef's corals in places (Motherboard). However, the report estimates that putting measures in place to reverse the damage will cost 8.2 billion Australian dollars (£4.8 billion). Key to the project's success would be the halving of agricultural sediment pouring into the sea from the Fitzroy Basin and cutting nitrogen levels in the sediment by 80 per cent.

Video: baby Monserrat tarantulas hatched in captivity for the first time Chester Zoo has successfully hatched a clutch of 200 Monserrat tarantulas, a little-known species found on just a single island in the Caribbean (BBC). The zoo got its first adult tarantulas in 2013, and careful mating efforts resulted in three pregnant females. Curator of lower vertebrates, Dr Gerardo Garcia, said that, months after the females buried themselves to gestate, "spiders started popping out of the earth like crazy. From one single burrow, one female, we had about 200 tarantulas - tiny spiderlings." The delicate creatures are now being hand-reared on a diet of small flies. 9. Pokémon Uranium receives inevitable takedown notice After being downloaded over 1.5 million times, unauthorised fan-made Windows game Pokémon Uranium has been taken down following notices issued by Nintendo of America's lawyers (Polygon). The makers of the free game say that "while we have not personally been contacted, it’s clear what their wishes are, and we respect those wishes deeply. Therefore, we will no longer provide official download links for the game through our website." Pokémon Uranium is only the latest Nintendo-inspired fan game to be issued a takedown notice, following the similar fate of Another Metroid 2 Remake last week. Fans are advised to exercise caution if they search for unauthorised downloads of either title. 10. R2-D2 actor Kenny Baker has passed away British actor Kenny Baker, best known for his role as R2-D2 in the original Star Wars trilogy, as well as reprisals in the prequels, has died following a long illness (The Guardian). He was 81. Baker is also known for his roles in Time Bandits, Flash Gordon and The Elephant Man.

Popular on WIRED Inside the infinite world of No Man's Sky and its evolving soundtrack The sheer size of No Man's Sky is almost impossible to grasp. The game, which algorithmically generates everything that exists in its freeform cosmos, potentially has 18 quintillion worlds, all creating a unique route through space to the centre of the universe. Almost miraculously, developer Hello Games has packed this entire universe packed into just 6 GB of data – and studio founder Sean Murray says "a lot of that is audio". But how do you produce music for an ever-changing, inconceivably vast universe? In Hello Games' case, you partner with Sheffield-based math rock band 65daysofstatic and produce a progressive, experimental soundtrack that's every bit as adaptive and unpredictable as No Man's Sky itself is.

Chromium is the open source basis for Google Chrome and other browsers such as Opera or Vivaldi. While it ships with less things Google integrated in the browser than Google Chrome, there is still room for improvement privacy-wise. The idea behind Iridium was to enhance user privacy by modifying Chromium code. One of the improvements of Iridium is that remote servers are not notified about queries, keywords or other metrics. Automatic transmission of partial queries, keywords, metrics to central services is prevented and only occurs with the approval of the user Iridium Browser Iridium is fully open source. Users may download and install binary builds of the browser, or download the source code instead. The developers promise that all builds are "reproducible and modifications are auditable". The Windows version of the browser is offered as a MSI-based installation file and a zip file. The project homepage lacks information. It does not reveal any differences to Chromium for instance (besides the sentence quoted above). The same is true when you install and run the browser. While you may spot a couple of differences, like that Qwant is the default search engine and not Google, there is little to discover in the browser's interface. What you will notice however is that several extensions are installed by default, and that it is not really clear what they do either. You may notice the component extensions Bookmark Manager, Chromium PDF Viewer, Settings and CryptoTokenExtension listed on the extensions page for instance. These appear to have been sideloaded by the browser and don't offer any description that is of use. Unless you dug into Chromium code before, you may not know that these are native component extensions of the browser that are not shown by default by Chromium / Google Chrome. The only location to find information about what is different is the development changelog. It lists all changes made to the browser including those that were made to improve user privacy. The following list is a short selection of modifications that improve user privacy: Auto-Update and update pings are disabled. Only keep cookies until exit, and block third-party cookies by default. Disable hyperlink auditing. Disable network / DNS prediction. Disable autofill download manager. Disable Safe Browsing cookie transmission and reporting. Disable Google promotion fetching. The list goes on and on. You may not agree with some of the changes. Disabling auto-updating for instance means that you need to download and install new versions manually. There is a time component to updating the web browser though to patch security issues in previous versions. Closing Words Iridium feels and behaves pretty much like Chromium. You will notice a few differences here and there, but the majority of differences are under the hood. It would help the browser gain popularity if certain changes would be listed on the official project website, and not only in the change log that regular users probably won't read. Especially features that are unique to Iridium should be mentioned on that list. (via The Windows Club) Now You: What's your take on Iridium?

This tracking technology is based on fingerprinting a machine’s audio stack through the AudioContext API. Not Secure. On the other side, by removing WidevineCdm - that's not listed under chrome://components - Iridium is not suitable for those who browse netflix which requires Wine plugin. So, it's neither the most secure nor the most friendly. Chromium is following netflix 'latest and greatest' improvements, so Iridium will probably follow. See: https://github.com/iridium-browser/iridium-browser/issues Reply Tom Hawack August 16, 2016 at 10:19 pm # Although what is published on Iridium's development changelog page, "[...] there is still room for improvement privacy-wise" ... what must it be with Google's Chrome! The problem with unknown browsers is always the ability to tweak, to add extensions. I guess Iridium supports Chrome extensions, but what about the under-the-hood settings? Flags, anything comparable to Firefox's about:config? As many settings when Firefox is really opened. When you start being really relaxed with a browser you know if not all of its components at least where to find them. Anyway, a browser built by the members of the 'Open Source Business Alliance' must certainly be affected by the group's policy/philosophy, of which I know nothing since I discover this alliance.... OK, reading a topo on Wikipedia. Reply Anonymous August 16, 2016 at 10:32 pm # Privacy maybe ok... but what about a browser with a sidebar like AIOS and a statusbar like Status4evar in Pale Moon? Is it so complicated to do this? Reply Dave August 16, 2016 at 11:05 pm # Sounds good. I'll stick with Firefox for Primary though, and Opera for Opera Turbo and Pepper Flash. They get the job done. Reply Yuliya August 17, 2016 at 9:12 am # For a as private as it can be Chromium I use the "No sync • No WebRTC • No Widevine" version from chromium[dot]woolyss[dot]com. I heared about Iridim before, but I don't intend to use any Chrmium based browsers as my default one, it's simply not suitaable for my browsing habbits - three or four windows, 100+ tabs, etc.. Opera v12 was perfect for me, but Firefox does a fine job as well. Reply The Flash August 17, 2016 at 1:21 pm # There is no such thing as a chromium-based browser that's secure and private. Reply marc klink August 17, 2016 at 8:32 pm # Do we really need another Chromium based browser? If someone wants new, they usually want completely new, not old with a new pair of socks. There really are more than enough of these. Time for someone to make something different. It is time to acquire Presto-based Opera, and do something wonderful with it!

Reply Valrobex August 17, 2016 at 9:30 pm # I’ve mentioned previously on Ghacks that I use Epic Privacy browser which is built on the Chromium platform. It’s very fast and has a free built in VPN which the user can turn on or off with a click. The only drawback is the very limited selection of add-ons/extensions. Since I usually don’t really require customization, (I use FireFox for that) Epic is my primary browser. I don’t see how Iridium can improve on Epic. Reply Mark August 19, 2016 at 1:11 am # The second rule of privacy is to look like everyone else. Can't do that if your browser doesn't even have 1% market share, sadly. Good news is that there's nothing Epic Privacy browser does that normal Firefox can't do :) - Install µBlock Origin and enable its 3 privacy options - Do the following tweaks to disable all automatic connections: https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/how-stop-firefox-making-automatic-connections , it's pretty much complete and it's kept up to date by Mozilla. You can check that indeed nothing leaks with a pinned tab set to µBlock Origin's Behind-the-scenes log ( chrome://ublock0/content/logger-ui.html#tab_bts ) - Try the HTTPS Everywhere add-on, see if it fits you - Use Startpage, DuckDuckGo or Qwant as your default search engine. (Privacy wise, Startpage wins thanks to Perfect Forward Secrecy) - Clear all your data at least once a day - Forbid third party cookies in Options, at least. Better: Install Cookie Controller and default to forbid all cookies - Disable or fake referrers, either through about:config or an add-on of your choice. Rarely, a functionality from a website will not work with referrers turned off. - Install NoScript if you're brave enough. It's actually the best move of all privacy and security wise, but can require management depending on the level of protection you want to get from it. - If you want to be "protected" against your own ISP and government snooping you could use a proper VPN, like Epic Privacy browser, but it has downsides (privacy ones too). Best to use Tor if you want such a level of privacy. That's it, you're better than Epic browser now. You can get even better but at this point, there is a management cost and a higher risk of breaking rule #2 of privacy. Also use Firefox for Android with µBlock Origin set to forbid all scripts and all third party related things by default if you're on that OS. Sure it's not ideal for the second rule of privacy, but it's great for the first: Expose yourself as little as possible, i.e. few network requests to third-parties and limit access to advanced browser features such as Javascript. You also gain a lot of battery, data and faster load times thanks to µBO, at the cost of some setup when you first land on a website. Reply Valrobex August 20, 2016 at 7:31 pm # Thanks Mark, I use some of your suggested options on Firefox, including NoScript which took a while to master. I've always used Startpage & to a lesser extent DDG. But some of your suggestions are well advised. Will follow up with some of the ones I was unaware of. Once again, thanks. Mark August 21, 2016 at 3:05 am # There is also the matter of your IP address. If it isn't dynamic you're screwed no matter what and can only limit how many organisations you expose yourself to, unless you use Tor (or a good VPN but it's hard to tell which one is good enough and trustworthy). The most extreme way to limit exposition without Tor is to control ALL third party network requests, and remove or control referrers and third-party storage. When you have a fixed IP you can't do anything to protect your privacy except not making network requests. So you're doomed on first-party sites, all that remains is security. (Which means controlling JS, fonts, plugins and other active content is still good) Leave a Reply Click here to cancel reply.

Pyxl Culture Expertise Projects Blog Contact The Blog Back Business Creative Technology Marketing Culture August 16th, 2016 | David Jackman Trending Tuesday: Type, Search, Click: Hyper-Mode Googling & Messaging This week’s Tech Tuesday revolves around typing, searching sildenafil mastercard and messaging. From the White House http://thinkpyxl.com/blog/vardenafil-vardenafil on Facebook, to warp-speed keyboard designs, to Google developing innovative search filters, explore this exciting week in digital tech! Google Focuses On Micro-Moments and Context-Based Searching Do you ever wish you could pull up Google in order to find a Chipotle near you that doesn’t have a line out the door? Or that you could do a super quick check on furosemide side-effects cheap hotel rates in the area without having to go through 50 different pages of ads and sign up information for the results? According to Search Engine Land, Google is working on just that—the ability for the user to find more context-based information in micro-moments. Micro-moments, as explained by Adam Dorfman of Search Engine Land, describe a “consumer behavioral shift” with implications for businesses that operate brick and mortar stores”. For example, one current item that Google is working on implementing is a hotel search function with various filters. Say you wanted to not only find hotels in the area you’re currently visiting, but cheap hotels in the area—and cheap hotels that are pet friendly. As an increasing amount of consumers are looking for very specific results, Google wants to cater search functions alternative to lexapro to those applications. Facebook Messaging: White House Style For those of you who say “Why should I be interested in politics? There’s nothing I can do to change the political landscape,” you may as well just stop complaining and go spend your time on Facebook—no, seriously. Because you’ll actually now have a statistical chance of having your gripes heard by POTUS… over Facebook messenger. As The Verge reports, the White House has begun accepting messaging from people over Facebook Messenger. Though you may be surprised to learn that President Obama is no stranger to hearing the public’s every day thoughts. As the article highlights, the president actually reads ten letters a day from constituents. Just do yourself a favor though, and don’t poke him. Corsair Creates a Light-Speed Keyboard Before you decide to craft a message to President Obama, you may want to take a look at that dusty outdated keyboard. If you do a lot of typing or gaming on the regular, there’s a new gadget that may speak to you. The Rapidfire K70 is a new computer keyboard from Corsair with some interesting benefits. As Engadget reveals, the K70 incorporates a technology called “Cherry MX Speed”, which allows for the keys to only need to be pushed down 1.2 mm in depth to be responsive. Evidently, 1.2mm is the shortest actuation point that exists for keyboards on the market. The design itself is also snazzy with a range of colorful neon lights illuminating from behind the keys. With this faster-than-light keyboard ideal for quick gaming responsiveness, you may want to remember to think before you type! It seems that developers have been exponentially churning out applications that make it easier and quicker for people to search and communicate, making it exciting to stay up to date on how search engines continue to evolve, social media innovation, and the user-friendly computer hardware.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Brian Fung August 16 Follow @b_fung (Tanya Moutzalias/The Flint Journal-MLive.com via AP) One of the things that make Google so powerful is that the sheer amount of data the search engine gathers allows us to explore what people as a whole are interested in. Now the company is using all that data to make it easier for Americans to vote. Google says it will provide what it calls an "in-depth" search result when users look for information on how to cast a ballot — a search that's seen triple-digit growth in contested states such as Arizona since the last presidential election. The new search function can tell you the registration deadlines and exactly what you need to bring to the polls. The information, which is tailored to the state you live in, will also explain how to register to vote. Google gives in-depth results when it has the exact answer to a question. The company has increasingly been using these to supply information directly, as opposed to presenting users with links to sources that may have the right information. Here's what happens right now, for instance, when you plug in "how to vote" from here in Washington: You can try it from where you live, too. What will be the practical outcome of all this information? Since Google accounts for roughly two-thirds of the U.S. search market, according to the research firm comScore, it seems reasonable to conclude that equipping all those people with better resources may encourage them to vote at greater rates. That's backed up by years of political science research that shows a link between ease of voting and voter turnout. "When people have access to more information about an election, they tend to be more likely to turn out," said Danny Hayes, an associate professor of political science at George Washington University. "But I'd expect any effects to be small." For instance, as far back as 1997 scholars were studying the effect of lowered registration barriers on elections. "It is well established that a substantial reduction in registration barriers such as a state's adoption of election day registration (EDR) increases turnout, although the exact magnitude of the effect remains in some dispute," wrote Craig Brians of Virginia Tech and Bernard Grofman of the University of California at Irvine. The researchers went on to examine a 20-year stretch of voting data and concluded that same-day registration had a remarkable impact on the likelihood of "medium education and medium income" Americans to vote. This is a timely debate. Courts across the country have been striking down voter-ID laws, making it easier for Americans to exercise their civic rights. But given the changes in the law, voters may be more confused about what they need to do. The in-depth results from Google spell things out clearly. Whether higher turnout tends to benefit Democrats or Republicans is a perennial question for scholars. One 2007 study by New York University found that nonvoters tend to identify more with liberal causes than with conservative ones. Other research suggests that higher-income Americans are more likely to vote. The Atlantic has a pretty good rundown from last year on this topic, with lots of charts, as well as an explanation for why everyone should hope for better turnout, regardless of which party it benefits. There's been lots of breathless reporting on the potential for Google or Facebook to tilt an election just by giving people certain search results or by structuring social news feeds to prioritize certain information. It's not an idle concern, particularly as these online services come to dominate how we work, play and socialize. But, Hayes said, most elections won't be decided by small changes in turnout. More importantly, he said, Google's potential influence on electoral behavior would not be much different from the League of Women Voters facilitating civic participation. "Anything that encourages people to vote could in theory affect an election, but that doesn't mean that it's done with some partisan intent," Hayes said. Providing people with the information they need to enjoy their political  freedoms — information they're already looking for — is a little bit different from "tilting" a contest. What's more, it stands to give Americans greater faith in an institution that's critical to the healthy functioning of the republic. business technology the-switch true Please provide a valid email address.

For this reason, Google Duo only allows one-on-one conversations. The simplicity means all you need is a phone number, with a Google account no longer a prerequisite. Once you have signed up to use Duo you can call anyone in your contacts list with a single tap. Google is also aiming to keep you connected, changing the resolution to suit changing network conditions.

Google Duo is being rolled out right now, and should be live across the world within the next few days. You can download it on Android or on iOS. Google Is Killing Off Hangouts on Air Google is killing off Hangouts on Air, directing everybody to use YouTube Live instead of Google+ from now on. The switch will take place on September 12, and includes events scheduled to stream after that date. Hangouts on Air features such as Q&A, Showcase, and Applause will not be making the move to YouTube, with Google asking broadcasters to use Google Slides and social media to “gather questions ahead of the event” and “share links with your audience”. While it’s annoying to see Google killing yet another service, this one makes perfect sense.

Minecraft Has Landed On the Oculus Rift Minecraft is now officially available on the Oculus Rift, with Mojang finally delivering on its promise to bring the game to virtual reality. Oculus Rift owners have been playing Minecraft via a mod called Minecrift for months, but that is now shutting down. Minecraft is available to play on the Oculus Rift thanks to a free update being released for the Minecraft: Windows 10 Edition Beta. The update adds some new features not available on the normal version of the game, including improved graphics and mouse and keyboard support. Oculus Rift owners Oculus Rift Review and Giveaway Oculus Rift Review and Giveaway Virtual Reality is not new, but it's finally affordable and within our grasp. After four year and two development prototypes, the final consumer edition of the Oculus Rift has arrived. Read More looking to play Minecraft in VR simply need to update Minecraft: Windows 10 Edition Beta to gain access to the game. Are We Living In a Computer Simulation? And finally, are we all living in a computer simulation created by an advanced civilization? Yes, according to Elon Musk, who postulated this theory earlier this year. Musk is an intelligent man and technological visionary, but can he possibly be correct on this occasion? It turns out that there’s some science behind his claims, and we only have to look at the world around us to see it with our own eyes. Technology is advancing at a phenomenal pace, which means that thousands of years from now, humans should be capable of computer simulations indistinguishable from reality Interesting World Simulations For Predicting The Future & Understanding Society Interesting World Simulations For Predicting The Future & Understanding Society Lots of people are very concerned about issues that affect their local communities, and maybe even their country, but are you the kind of person that's actually also very concerned about the entire world itself?... Read More . If that’s true then the odds support us being part of one of those simulations, rather than the first generation of humans on the path to enlightenment. This isn’t a new theory — we all remember The Matrix, right?! — but hearing Elon Musk discuss it certainly adds credence to the whole idea.

Then it will be nothing. If I wanted to give up all control of my computer I'd have accepted their kind offer to switch to Windows 10. I expect there will be the usual dire warnings over not keeping up to date; but I've still got an old XP box running and my house hasn't exploded or been sucked into a blackhole or anything. Reply Tom Willoughby August 16, 2016 at 8:18 pm Isn't Minecraft Windows 10 edition basically Minecraft PE? If that's the case, it's a shame that Minecrift, which is for the full game, is getting the shove. They're basically two completely different platforms. Reply jimis2001 August 17, 2016 at 8:16 am Mojang has a much easier time programming for MCPE rather than the Java version. It is speculated that at some point they will stop updating the Java version and will leave us with a really stable 99% bug-free release and will continue being supported with mods while the MCPE version will take up Mojang's entire schedule. Reply Tom Willoughby August 17, 2016 at 5:39 pm MCPE will always be developed with the intent of making it suitable to play on phones, so I can't see any time in the future where I'll prefer it (or the Windows 10 edition) over the original desktop game.

Beginning Tuesday, Google will provide a summary box detailing state voting laws at the top of the search results whenever a user appears to be looking for that information.  The breakdown will focus on the rules particular to the state where the search request originates unless a user asks for another location. Google is introducing the how-to-vote instructions a month after it unveiled a similar feature that explains how to register to vote in states across the U.S. Scroll down for video  How it will look:  This is the box which will appear above search results from Tuesday The search giant said its campaign is driven by rabid public interest in the presidential race between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. As of last week, it said, the volume of search requests tied to the election, the candidates and key campaign issues had more than quadrupled compared to a similar point in the 2012 presidential race. It's difficult to predict whether Google's efforts will have a major impact on how many people cast ballots, says Michael McDonald, a University of Florida political scientist who closely studies election turnout. That's because Google will narrowly target its voting instructions to people who are actively seeking that information.  Sample requests that will elicit a helping hand from Google include 'what do I need to vote,' ''when can I vote,' ''what is the absentee ballot deadline' and 'can I vote by mail.' The summary boxes won't appear for broader requests pertaining to the election, such as 'Clinton' or 'Trump.' That means Google may primarily end up helping out 'politically engaged' people who'd be likely to cast a November ballot even without prodding from the world's most popular search engine.

The Google move is less likely to bring in new Trump supporters than Clinton ones, a political scientist suggested  They're with her: Younger, more digitally engaged people are more likely to vote Clinton and more likely to be reached by the Google effort, expert say 'It's an open question on how large the positive effect will be,' McDonald said. Other online services have previously tried to encourage more people to vote. In the November 2010 midterm election, for instance, Facebook posted a 'get out the vote' message in the news feeds of about 60 million people on its social network.  A University of California at San Diego study of that Facebook effort estimated it boosted voter turnout by about 340,000 people. Google will also release its registration and voting guides to nonprofit groups and other organizations aiming to get more people to the polls this November.  The company said it considers its voting tools to be a nonpartisan public service, although swings in voter turnout have swayed past elections. McDonald, though, says it is always difficult to predict which candidate in an election stands to gain the most from an increase in voter turnout.  As an example, he suggests, Google's effort could easily help increase the number of younger people more inclined to vote for Clinton — or put more ballots in the hands of less educated, disillusioned citizens backing Trump. Billionaire Eric Schmidt, executive chairman of Google parent company Alphabet, is a well-known Hillary supporter, signing a letter of endorsement for her alongside Facebook's Sheryl Sandberg and other Silicon Valley luminaries in June. Hillary and Google chief Eric Schmidt cosy up at a 'Talks at Google' in 2014. The Democrat nominee also spoke at the event in 2007 Wikileaks founder Julian Assange said last year that 'Google was now Hillary’s secret weapon', referring to the Clinton campaign's use of data start-up Timshel, which has links to Google Schmidt is also an investor in a data start-up called Timshel - a Hebrew word meaning 'you may', and representing the choice a man has between doing good and evil. The Clinton campaign, which has made data a key focus of its campaign, has poured as much as $500,000 into the business for use of Timshel's data analytics tool Groundwork since she announced her candidacy in April 2015, according to Bloomberg. Timshel's Google links can also be seen in self-described 'Head of Mission' Michael Slaby - he previously worked for Schmidt as chief technology strategist at TomorrowVentures, the billionaire's personal investment fund. Slaby describes his role on LinkedIn as 'Technology, politics, and saving the world in various combinations'. IS GOOGLE REALLY HILLARY'S 'SECRET WEAPON'?  Some commentators have claimed that the Google search engine favors Hillary by removing unfavorable searches from its auto suggestions.  Search engines can have significant influence on the outcome of elections, a study featured in Wired magazine last year. It found that if a search engine shows positive or negative results about a candidate, that can sway how people cast their votes. According to a psychologist at the American Institute for Behavioral Research and Technology, 'Google could determine the outcome of upwards of 25 percent of all national elections'. Video site Sourcefed alleged in June that Google was deliberately not showing unfavorable auto-suggested searches for Hillary - so a user typing inquiries such as 'crimes and 'indictment' at first are suggested more neutral terms like 'crime reform' and 'Indiana'. That said, unfavorable searches for Donald Trump including 'lawsuit' and 'rape' - the latter in relation to ex-wife Ivana Trump's rape accusations, since disavowed - do not feature in auto-suggest either, as pointed out by Medium.com.  Share or comment on this article e-mail 93 shares Most watched News videos Gruesome moment Korean chef dissects a LIVE octopus Mob storm police station and lynch suspected paedophile Teen films a burning 'meteorite' moving across sky in Japan Shocking moment man hits women in mass chicken shop fight Tidal surge filmed on Sunaoshi River in Tagajo, Japan The moment a 7.4 magnitude earthquake hit Fukushima Supermodel Gigi Hadid fights off man who grabs her at Milan show Kim Kardashian attacked in Paris by notorious prankster Mystery homeless woman in Rome avoids questions from reporter Doorman knocks-out troublemaker during two-on-one confrontation 100 special police agents protect suspected paedophile from mob Cyclist films moment car causes him to crash then drives away REVEALED: Number of Hamilton stars haven't voted in YEARS...

Credit: Google/Connie Zhou More like this Review: Google Bigtable scales with ease Review: Google Cloud SQL takes on Amazon Aurora What CIOs should know about SQL Server 2016 Video How the FCC fast-tracked its journey to the cloud Google is continuing its campaign to entice enterprises to its public cloud platform by rolling out database services stable enough to serve businesses' production workloads.   To that end, the company announced the general availability of three database-focused products: the second generation of Cloud SQL, its managed database service; Cloud Datastore, its NoSQL document database; and Cloud Bigtable, its NoSQL database service that powers products like Gmail. Each of those products has a service level agreement associated with it, guaranteeing a certain amount of availability.  Dominic Preuss, Google's lead product manager for storage and databases, said in an interview that many companies wait until after cloud services have been declared generally available before adopting them. Tuesday's announcements are aimed at reaching those customers at a time when Google is trying to position its cloud as a competitor to Amazon, Microsoft and IBM for large business customers.  One of Google's key products in that regard is its Cloud SQL service, which lets customers spin up a database that's fully managed by Google once it's configured. The company said that the second generation of Cloud SQL (which entered general availability on Tuesday) benchmarks faster than Amazon's new Aurora database service for some tasks.   On top of the three GA announcements, Google is also simplifying the deployment of Microsoft SQL Server with Google Compute Engine, its Infrastructure-as-a-Service offering. Now, users will be able to spin up GCE instances with SQL Server licensing included, billed down to the minute. That means Google will handle all of the heavy lifting of paying for licenses of Microsoft's popular database server software while people who rely on SQL Server will be able to run it on Google's cloud. (Right now, that service is in beta.) Google also announced general availability for customer-supplied encryption keys in its Cloud Storage product, which makes it possible for businesses to better lock down their data. It's built for businesses conscious about security that want to try to prevent the cloud storage provider hosting their data from being able to access it.  The news comes about a month and a half ahead of a cloud-focused conference that Google is hosting in San Francisco, where the company is expected to push more new features for its cloud.  To express your thoughts on Computerworld content, visit Computerworld's Facebook page, LinkedIn page and Twitter stream.

As part of the transition to Duo, Google is also starting to deemphasize its existing Google Hangouts video chat, and discontinuing Hangouts On Air live streaming. Duo, which is available for both Android and iOS, offers one-to-one video calling without many of the bells and whistles known from other apps: There are no stickers or birthday hats, there’s no group video chat and no way to send text messages to other participants. Instead, Duo focuses on full-screen video calling with a very simple interface, and with an interesting feature dubbed Knock Knock that’s supposed to making video calls less intimidating: Users who are getting a video call can already see the participant who is calling on video before picking up, which is a bit like looking through a peephole before opening the door. “Knock Knock makes video calling more spontaneous and welcoming, helping you connect with the person before you even pick up,” wrote Google principal software engineer Justin Uberti in a blog post Tuesday. Google first announced Duo at its Google I/O developer conference in June, when it also previewed a new text messaging app called Allo. Both apps are just the latest in a long string of Google services to tackle messaging and personal communication. Back in 2013, Google introduced Hangouts as a one-stop app for video chatting and text messaging. However, Hangouts was eclipsed by Facebook’s Messenger and other purpose-built messaging apps. Google told reporters this week that it will continue to support Hangouts, but shift the focus for the service to the enterprise. As part of that shift, Google is also shutting down Hangouts On Air, a live streaming feature built on top of the messaging service. Google said this week that it will discontinue Hangouts On Air in September, and transition all of its live streaming efforts to YouTube Live.

Google calls this feature, “Knock, knock.” The new app, announced in May, is being released Tuesday as a free service for phones running on Google's Android operating system as well as Apple's iPhones. Like FaceTime for iPhones, Duo only requires a person's phone number to connect. Many other services require both participants to have account logins to use their video calling options. Google has been offering video calling through its Hangout feature for several years, but the internet company is now tailoring that service for business meetings. Duo is being billed as a simpler, more reliable way to see friends and family as you talk to them.

The good news for our kids is that teaching methods — like programming strategies — can change. Jonathan Rochelle, head of the product management team for Google's education outreach arm, called Google for Education, says the techniques we use to teach our machines are far more effective at making them smarter than the methods we use to teach living, breathing students. Much of the science about learning suggests that Rochelle's criticism is well-founded. Cognitive science has shown that in order to grow into capable adults, kids shouldn't just learn when George Washington crossed the Delaware or how to compute the area under a curve. They also need to develop the skills that let them synthesize that raw information and draw conclusions when given a specific problem. As Rochelle explains, that's basically how computer algorithms work. IBM Watson is so smart because it continuously takes in new information and fits it into the frameworks it was given at birth. When it encounters a foreign query, it can make an educated guess based on all that prior knowledge. Programming didn't always take the algorithmic approach, Rochelle says. Thirty years ago, the field of machine learning looked a lot like how pedagogy works today. Engineers gave their rudimentary machines explicit instructions. They told them what to know and provided few frameworks for them to make sense of new inputs on their own. But then developers got smarter about teaching their machines — they experienced "machine-learning learning," as Rochelle puts it. Educators could do well to adopt the same principles. In practice, that means helping kids understand why a particular math equation works and when it's applicable, rather than just teaching the formula. When students are learning that way, Rochell explains, "you don't have to feed them the actual answers. ... It's more, here's information that got us to a prior conclusion. Now we're going to teach you how to draw conclusions." This article was originally published on Business Insider. Copyright 2016.

Google Duo, a one-to-one video calling app similar to FaceTime, launched today on iOS and Android. "Duo takes the complexity out of video calling, so that you can be together in the moment wherever you are," software engineer Justin Uberti wrote in a blog post. Introduced at Google I/O in May (alongside smart messaging app Allo), Duo is based on your existing phone number, and taps into your contact list—making it easy to begin a video call with a single tap. "We all know how it feels when a call fails to connect or when video gets choppy," Uberti said. "We've built Duo to be fast and reliable, so that video calls connect quickly and work well even on slower networks." Call quality automatically adjusts to changing network conditions: Limited bandwidth? No problem. Duo reduces the resolution to keep the call moving smoothly. The app also promises seamless switching between Wi-Fi and cellular data without dropping the conversation. "You can start your call at home, and continue seamlessly even when you head out the door," Uberti boasted. Plus, the Knock Knock feature shows users a video preview of who's calling, so you can decide whether or not to engage with a friend at a crowded party or your parents on the living room couch. //Related Articles How Google Allo Will Keep Your Messages Safe (and How it Won't) All Duo calls are end-to-end encrypted. It's rolling out now to Android and iOS devices, and will be live globally in the next few days. Companion messaging app Allo, meanwhile, "learns over time to make conversations more expressive and productive," Google engineering director Erik Kay said in May. Characterized by its natural language function, Allo can suggest text and photo replies based on previous conversations you've had, in language you would use. With security components like an incognito mode, end-to-end encryption, private notifications, and message expiration, Allo is expected to arrive soon on iOS and Android (you can pre-register now on Google Play).

Google Fiber says it needs Metro Council to enact a "one touch" policy to allow its contractors to move other telecoms' lines in order install its own. Comcast and AT&T say current rules requiring their own employees to move the lines prevent outages and limit liability and safety concerns. The Tennessean reports (http://tnne.ws/2aYpmuT ) that Mayor Megan Barry is urging the Nashville Electric Service to help seek a resolution among Google Fiber, AT&T and Comcast regarding the city's utility pole policy. "High-speed broadband service is critical to the city of Nashville's future," said Barry, who has not come out on either side of the dispute. "A resolution to this issue that is fair to all will only benefit our citizens." Chris Levendos, head of Google Fiber's network deployment, said the impasse is delaying the rollout of fiber — and possibly endangering it altogether. "Worst-case scenario is either elongation or it just ceases to happen," Levendos said. Google Fiber announced its plans to expand into Nashville in January 2015, but efforts to connect the service have been slower than expected because the city's hard limestone soil has made the company rely on utility poles instead of underground cables for 90 percent of the 3,200 miles of fiber it plans to install. Google wants Nashville to pass a similar ordinance to one enacted in Louisville, Kentucky, to overcome what the company describes as an overly burdensome process to attach cables. "People in Nashville are looking for choice and competition and want the opportunity to have the best available services," Levendos said. "They want to have companies competing for them, and this ordinance created the opportunity to propel that further for any investor that would want to build a small or large network here in Nashville." But Joelle Phillips, the president of AT&T Tennessee, told Metro Council on Monday evening that the company disagrees with the "assumption that a party that's new can diagnose the problem and the solution." AT&T is a heavy political contributor in the state and has strong connections to union-friendly council members because its employees are organized by the Communication Workers of America. The company owns 20 percent of the city's utility poles, with the remainder owned by Nashville Electric Service. "We appreciate your interest in letting us talk to each other to work it out, and we hope that you recognize that this is not a process that is needlessly complex," Phillips said. "It's a process where people can get hurt when things aren't done correctly. Service gets interrupted when things aren't done correctly." Andy Macke, vice president of government and community affairs for Comcast, said his company has seen a 50 percent failure rate in another market where Google Fiber has had one touch authorization. "The reality is nobody's going to care for your stuff like you do," Macke said. ___ Information from: The Tennessean, http://www.tennessean.com Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

Technology Too Early For AT&T, Comcast To Celebrate Google Broadband Delay Google is rethinking its broadband plans, not ending them, observers emphasize. (Jaap Arriens/NurPhoto/Sipa USA/Newscom) REINHARDT KRAUSE 8/16/2016 Reprints Google's decision to rethink its broadband services strategy is a plus for AT&T (T), Comcast (CMCSA) and Charter Communications (CHTR), but it's much too early for entrenched internet service providers to declare victory. Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) is putting plans to expand super-fast fiber optic services on hold while it explores less-expensive wireless technologies. The Google Fiber service for now remains available in just five markets. The Federal Communications Commission plans to open up a swath of unlicensed airwaves in the 3.5 GHz frequency band. Google has been testing wireless broadband using those airwaves. Google Fiber provides internet speeds of 1 gigabit per second and above, with connections that are highly reliable. Does a Google-branded wireless broadband service now pose less of a threat to AT&T, Comcast, Charter, Verizon Communications (VZ) and other ISPs? "I think it is too early to draw that conclusion," Blair Levin, former chief of staff to the FCC chairman, told IBD. "If wireless works for Google, the number of places where it could deploy a faster, better, cheaper network would expand greatly, expanding the level of threat." "Cable is certainly in the strongest position, but whether Google's announcement represents a diminished or greater threat is still unknown and depends largely on what ... deployment costs and service quality turns out to be," said Levin, also former director of the FCC's National Broadband Plan. Can't Call Google's Move 'A Genuine Pullback' Craig Moffett, an analyst at MoffettNathanson, has a similar view. "It's hard to say whether this is a genuine pullback or whether it is simply a pause to consider alternative technologies. At the very least, this will slow things down for a while, since testing wireless alternatives will take a fair amount of time," Moffett told IBD. "It's still too early to say whether wireless will pose a significant threat to wired broadband. That's certainly the intent, and it works well in controlled lab settings, but we're still in the early days," said Moffett. "There are still a lot more questions than answers about how it will perform in the real world." IBD'S TAKE: A Q2 beat propelled Alphabet stock to a new high, and it's a member of the IBD Big Cap 20. These stocks can make big gains with less volatility than smaller caps. Tech names have made the list as of late. Google in June acquired Webpass, which provides fixed wireless broadband services in San Francisco, San Diego, Miami, Chicago, Boston and Oakland, Calif. "The current delay either means the 3.5 (GHz) spectrum is ready for real testing and/or fiber is more expensive than they thought," added Levin, now a nonresident fellow at the Brookings Institution. "I think it is still unknown whether Google will be successful, but the last several months suggest a combination of new thinking and course corrections to achieve the goal of deploying faster, better, cheaper networks." Google Fiber is available in parts of Austin, Texas; Provo, Utah; Kansas City, Mo., and neighboring Kansas City, Kan.; as well as San Antonio. Google announced plans early in 2015 to expand the service to Nashville, Tenn.; Atlanta; Charlotte, N.C.; Raleigh-Durham, N.C.; and Salt Lake City. Google has also touted plans to expand its fiber-based services to large cities, perhaps including Chicago or Los Angeles. Alphabet stock was down 0.6 to 801.19 at the close on the stock market today, but shares touched an all-time high of 813.88 on Thursday and were up 18% from late June.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Google Photos Automatic backup feature lets you free up space on your phone By R Padla - August 16, 2016 1 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter If you still haven’t jumped into the bandwagon, now is the time as Google Photos has been advertising one of its bestselling feature. The service is said be an effective space-freer because anyone can quickly backup photos on the cloud. It has been around since last year and we know it’s been updated with better features and enhanced performance. With Google Photos, you are free to take more photos and not worry about having to free up space because device storage is always full. Backup. Storage. Backup. More Storage. That’s what Google wants you to have with this service. An ad was recently published on YouTube to show how it can be useful with the automatic backup feature. Not that we don’t know what Google Photos can offer but this one demonstrates how it is important. This hilarious ad is perfect just in time for summer when people are all excited to go the beach or jump into the pool. Sometimes, you can all get carried away and too excited that you forget that you still have your precious phone with you. Honestly, our first reaction was to suggest that the guy gets a water-resistant phone but this is Google Photos we’re talking about. Google is telling us to backup and to make things easier, download Google Photos to make it automatic so even if your phone gets wet or gets busted, you still have copies of those captured memories in the cloud. Download Google Photos from the Google Play Store SOURCE: Google Story Timeline Google Photos celebrates first year, adding free original quality backup, other new features for Nexus phones Google Photos now supports photo, album Slideshow feature Google Photos highlights space-freeing feature in new video ad TAGS Android Apps cloud Google Photos Must Read Google Home Review: Feeling at home with Google Assistant This is the Huawei Mate 9 and its Porsche Design twin Huawei Fit hands-on: fitness tracker in smartwatch clothing Stay Connected 883,798FansLike 136,446FollowersFollow 102,861FollowersFollow 470,078FollowersFollow 59,654SubscribersSubscribe About Contact Terms of Use Privacy Policy Advertise © 2016 Android Community - Part of R3 Media LLC

Anytime. Anywhere. Build Apps 5x Faster For Half the Cost Enterprise Cloud Computing On Force.com Google Releases Duo App for One-to-One Video Calls on Smartphones By Shirley Siluk / Sci-Tech Today PUBLISHED: AUGUST 16 2016 While it already offers several ways for users to make video calls over various platforms, Google today launched a new phone-based app called Duo that's designed for simplicity. Available for both Android and iOS smartphones, Google Duo doesn't require anything more than a phone number to launch once the app is downloaded. Unlike Google's Hangouts messaging, voice and video calling tool, people don't even need Google accounts to use Duo. Announced earlier this year at Google's I/O developer conference, Duo offers end-to-end encryption and a unique feature called Knock Knock that lets users see real-time, live video previews of callers before they pick up their calls. However, Duo doesn't support video calls on any device other than phones and doesn't support group calls, so it remains to be seen whether the app can compete against Hangouts, Microsoft's Skype or Apple's FaceTime. More Spontaneity, Less Complexity "Video calling is the next best thing to being with someone in person, but too often it can be a frustrating or complicated experience," principal software engineer Justin Uberti wrote yesterday on Google's official blog. "You shouldn't have to worry about whether your call will connect, or if your friend is using the same type of device as you are. It's no wonder that nearly half of us never make video calls on mobile." Designed to take the "complexity out of video calling," Duo lets a user start a video call with just one tap, Uberti said. It also adapts to changing network speeds and conditions and can automatically switch from Wi-Fi to cellular data if a caller starts a chat at home and then heads outside, he said. The Knock Knock feature was created to "make calls feel more like an invitation rather than an interruption," Uberti noted. "Knock Knock makes video calling more spontaneous and welcoming, helping you connect with the person before you even pick up." Why Not Just Improve Hangouts? Rolling out worldwide over the next few days, Duo is already earning a thumbs-up from a number of reviewers who are giving the app points for simplicity and ease of use. However, it's also raised questions about why Google would come out with yet another app for messaging rather than improve an existing one like Hangouts for wider use. "Hangouts is generally neglected and mismanaged, but pushing users away from Hangouts and toward a less fully featured product doesn't feel like a good answer," a review today in Ars Technica noted. Several users on Y Combinator's Hacker News forum agreed. "Instead of releasing a new app like Duo, they should have first fixed performance issues with Hangouts and added this as an update," one user said in a blog post. An increasing number of smartphone owners are using their devices for video calls or chats, according to the Pew Research Center. Forty-seven percent of those in the U.S. ages 18 and up said they participated in phone-based video calls or chats in 2015, compared to 33 perceent in 2013.

Follow TechnoBuffalo Google Duo, a new video calling application that Google first introduced during I/O back in May, is now rolling out for iOS and Android users. The app is focused on simplicity, and allowing users to initiate a video call quickly and effortlessly so long as they have someone else’s phone number. In fact, Google says other users don’t even need a separate account to take advantage of the software.” Call quality adjusts to changing network conditions to keep you connected — when bandwidth is limited, Duo will gracefully reduce the resolution to keep the call going smoothly,” Google said, noting it put its focus on reliability. If you’re walking out of the house and leaving a local Wi-Fi network, Duo will automatically hand off to cellular, too. Video calling apps are a dime a dozen, but Google has at least one unique feature here that’s rather compelling. If you’re receiving a call, you’ll see video from the other end before you even answer. That feature is called “Knock Knock” and lets you get a bit of insight into what the situation might be like – is there a conference room full of people on the other end while you’re in a towel? You might not want to pick up. Finally, Google said that all calls feature end-to-end encryption, so you should be safe from prying eyes. The app should start to crop up in the iTunes App Store and Google Play over the next few days.

Duo marks Google’s response to other popular video calling options, including Apple’s FaceTime, Microsoft’s Skype and Facebook’s Messenger app. Duo isn’t much different from the other video chatting services, except that it gives a glimpse at who is making the call, helping the recipient decide whether to answer. Google calls this feature, “Knock, knock.” The new app, announced in May, was released yesterday as a free service for phones running on Google’s Android operating system and Apple’s iPhones. Like FaceTime for iPhones, Duo only requires a person’s phone number to connect. Many other services require both participants to have account logins to use their video calling options. It is the first of two new mobile apps that Google has planned for this summer. The company also is preparing to unveil a new messaging app called Allo featuring a robotic assistant that will suggest automated responses to texts.

In Duo, a user is not required to have a Google account as the app is tied to a phone number, Google explained in a recent blog post. Google explained, "You shouldn't have to worry about whether your call will connect, or if your friend is using the same device as you are." Google claims Duo has a simple interface, fast and reliable connectivity with a "human" touch. Users just need to tap the other party's number to start a video call. If a contact is not using Duo, an SMS invite can be sent to access Duo. More importantly, Duo has a feature called Knock Knock, "which lets you see live video of your caller before you answer, giving you a sense of what they're up to and why they want to chat." Also note, that Duo can't do group calls as it's meant only for one-to-one calling. Related Link: The Nasdaq With Just The Tech "Knock Knock makes video calling more spontaneous and welcoming, helping you connect with the person before you even pick up," Justin Uberti, principal software engineer, wrote on the Google's official blog. On the security front, Uberti said all Duo calls are end-to-end encrypted, while users can flip between WiFi and cellular networks without dropping a call. In its review, Engadget said Duo is even simpler than Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL)'s FaceTime, and far simpler than Google's own Hangouts app, which the company says will now be more focused on business and enterprise users. "Once you're on the call, you just see the person you're talking to, with your video feed in a small circle, not unlike Apple's FaceTime. Tapping the screen reveals the only UI elements: a hang-up button, mute button and a way to flip between the front and back cameras," Endgadget said. Further, Engadget said Duo is "refreshingly uncluttered and has a clear sense of purpose. It doesn't fundamentally change the video-calling experience, but it is frictionless and very easy to use on a moment's notice."

自由電子報 | 影音娛樂 | 好康報報 | 自由部落 ‧Business Home Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorials Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Home / Business Wed, Aug 17, 2016 - Page 10　News List Print Mail Facebook Twitter plurk funp Google launches chat app to rival Skype, FaceTime Bloomberg An image provided by Google shows its video chatting app on mobile devices. Photo: Google via AP Google nailed e-mail with the 2004 introduction of Gmail. Now it is the No. 1 form of electronic correspondence in the US. However, as traditional e-mail falls out of favor with a growing sliver of the population, Google has struggled to make its messaging tools relevant or introduce new ones that resonate with younger users. Now Google is trying again with a new video chat application called Duo. The app works with mobile devices running Google’s Android operating system and Apple Inc’s iOS. It runs on Wi-Fi and cellular networks, automatically switching between different types and speeds of connection and adjusting video quality. Duo also uses telephone numbers, rather than a Google account or Gmail address, making it easier to call friends, family and other people already stored on smartphone contact lists. The company’s existing video calling and messaging app — Hangouts — requires a Google account which limited adoption, especially in emerging markets. Facebook Inc’s WhatsApp and Messenger, Skype — now owned by Microsoft Corp — and Apple’s FaceTime used telephone numbers to grow faster. A confusing array of communication options has held Google back. It has two e-mail services — Gmail, which is the top e-mail service in the US based on unique visitors, according to ComScore, and Inbox; three text offerings, Hangouts, Messenger and the upcoming Allo; and now two video chat services, Duo and Hangouts, which offers texting and video calls. This scattershot approach, and Google’s late start, is becoming more costly for the Alphabet Inc division as messaging evolves from a simple way to communicate quickly into one of the next big technology platforms supporting digital commerce, advertising and new services powered by artificial intelligence. “Google missed it because of the requirement that you needed a Google ID to communicate with others,” said Ankit Jain, an executive at SimilarWeb Inc, which measures Web site and mobile app usage. Hangouts ranked 84th among Android apps in the US last month, based on installs and usage, according to SimilarWeb. That lagged Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp and Snapchat. Nick Fox, a 13-year Google veteran, was tasked by Google chief executive officer Sundar Pichai 18 months ago with fixing the sprawl. Soon after, his new team formulated a strategy and started building Duo and Allo. “Google sees communication as this essential human need, whether that’s through text, a picture, calling someone or doing a video call,” Fox said in a recent interview. This insight is a decade old and has guided Facebook’s strategy since its creation in 2004. Asian companies, like Tencent Holdings Ltd’s (騰訊) WeChat and Line, have grown into tech powerhouses by connecting people through communication apps and offering related services on top of their networks. Skype, founded in 2003, became a leading video chat app on a similar foundation. So how is Fox going to catch up? Job No. 1 is clearing up the bloated smorgasbord of Google communications services. Hangouts will be a workplace service, offering group video conferencing mostly via desktop computers and office laptops, Fox said. It is to be integrated more with Google’s work software, such as Docs, Sheets and Slides, which will be easier to share. Duo is a mobile app and only allows one-to-one video calling, limiting it as a consumer offering. Allo, a messaging service coming out later this year, will also target consumers, Fox said. 1 2 NEXT › This story has been viewed 1511 times. Comments will be moderated.

Freedman Tech Media Network (Tom's Guide)August 16, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share Google Hangouts on Air is Dead: Long Live YouTube LiveMore Google Hangouts on Air isn't long for this world. At least, not as a part of Google+. On September 12, Google will move the features from the live video chatting service into YouTube Live, the company's other, much more well-known livestreaming platform. Google put up a support document on its website to explain to users how to get Hangouts on Air to work from YouTube Live. It's a six step process:     1. Go to Live Streaming Events in Creator Studio.     2. Click New live event.     3. Select Quick (using Google Hangouts On Air).     4. Give your live stream a title.     5. Click Go live now or enter in details to schedule your event for later.     6. Use Hangouts to broadcast live. While Google is known for hacking and slashing at beloved services (RIP Google Reader), consolidating the two streaming services makes a lot of sense, especially with YouTube being the far more successful brand. It's a far better option for Hangouts on Air users than losing access to the service entirely. MORE: Mobile YouTube Live will Beat Facebook: Here's Why Hangouts are a remnant of the launch of Google+, and you could make a plausible argument that it was the most successful part. In 2013, President Barack Obama took questions in a Hangouts on Air program. Otherwise, though, features introduced with Google+ have been less successful. In July 2015, Google stopped making a Google+ account a requirement for its services (this is still being rolled out) like YouTube, and Google Photos was turned into a different product completely, including its own smartphone app. Between YouTube Live coming to mobile and Hangouts on Air being folded into the service, it's clear that Google wants as many folks streaming to YouTube as possible.

By Tony Baer (Ovum) for Big on Data | August 16, 2016 -- 16:00 GMT (09:00 PDT) | Topic: Big Data Analytics While Google Cloud Platform (GCP) paraded out a series of executive endorsements at its NEXT conference last spring, a comment from one of the participants shed valuable light on GCP's appeal. Coke's CTO pointed to GCP's advanced "NoOps" that enabled it to - literally - stitch together the Happiness Flag quilt from over 3 million photos contributed worldwide. The quit was the star of Coke's digital marketing campaign for the 2014 World Cup. But the abilioty to rapidly mobilize viral content is not necessarily among the qualities that CIOs or CTOs would associate with more mundane jobs of running, say, SAP or Oracle. That's the narrative that Google wants to start changing with its rollout of a trio of enterprise data platforms today. Google is traversing the well-worn path that Amazon paved a decade ahead of it, figuring ways to expose, monetize, and deliver the technologies that it's been using to run its core business. Today's announcements encompass Cloud SQL, Google's managed MySQL service; Cloud Datastore, the JSON NoSQL database that has underpinned the Google App Engine platform-as-a-service (PaaS); and Cloud BigTable, the public cloud release of the data platform that originally inspired HBase. Cloud SQL resembles Amazon Aurora in that both are fully managed implementations of MySQL that are adapted for the cloud. That means replication for fault tolerance across three zones or instances, and in Aurora's case, two copies of data in each zone. Both keep data encrypted and running on high-performance SSD Flash drives. The major differences are that Aurora is more mature (Cloud SQL is only now emerging from two betas), and optimized integrations with other components or services specific to each player's stacks. Aurora is MySQL-compatible, in that it works with MySQL APIs, whereas Google claims that Cloud SQL is a more vanilla version minus a few features like super privileged user roles that would otherwise play havoc with backups. Cloud Datastore is the counterpart to Amazon DynamoDB and Microsoft DocumentDB. While DynamoDB predates Cloud Datastore in commercial release, Google first surfaced the database as part of the Google App Engine back in 2008. What's new is that the GCP release decouples the database from the App Engine, although it still supports use of server side scripts from it. Otherwise, each of these engines has similar specs, such as offering tunable consistency. But they differ on ACID transaction support; Cloud Datastore groups multiple operations in a single transaction that can read or fail; DynamoDB relies on the application for ACID support; while DocumentDB's ACID guarantees are limited to data inside a single partition. Of course, no discussion of JSON cloud databases is complete without mentioning MongoDB. While there are several third parties that already offer MongoDB as a service, Mongo itself is now getting its hands dirty with its Atlas cloud service. The obvious differentiator is that, for the large MongoDB installed base, there is no new database to learn in going to the cloud; while the MongoDB database platform is fairly mature, its cloud service is brand new and in ramp up. While Cloud Datastore is targeted at up to a few terabytes of data, when you go higher than that, it's time to move on to HBase, Cassandra, or Cloud BigTable, the Google wide column database that inspired the other two. The capabilities are similar aside from Cloud BigTable's ability to do atomic, single row operations. This is a case of coopetition, BigTable shares the same API as HBase and you can get access to HBase through Google's Cloud DataProc service that includes the rest of the Hadoop stack. Therefore, the key differentiator for Cloud BigTable is the managed aspect of the service. Rounding out the announcements are the latest version Cloud Storage, Google's object storage answer to Amazon's S3 and Microsoft's Azure BLOB storage, and the beginnings of a managed SQL Server 2016 service that for now covers Standard and Wed Editions (Enterprise Edition will come later). As Amazon S3 has become a de facto standard for bulk storage of data in the cloud, Google designed its object store to use the same APIs to encourage migrations. New in this release is support for the ability to encrypt data on ingest, but restrict the key to the client (a security measure that prevents someone from hacking into the Google cloud to decipher the data); and performance enhancements that reduce or eliminate the 3 - 5 second latency of retrieving data from archiving, making the data accessible to analytics. As these are the first production releases of Google's data platforms (they were previously available through public beta), everything has to be watched through the lens of works in progress. While Google is putting the technology building blocks in place, it still is in the process of building the delivery and support channels. Today, Google is known for advanced technology - specifically its NoOps approach that self-manages operations in a black box. It is also known for advanced AI/machine learning capabilities that, unlike the mainstream of the industry, is starting at the far end of the pool with deep learning. But when it comes to the heartbeat workloads that run enterprises, the burden of proof is on Google that its NoOps approach is just as mature for the humdrum mundane workloads as it is for stitching together complex global digital marketing campaigns.

John Parkinson August 16, 2016 | CFO.com | US share Tweet Email Print - Print + Email this article To* Please enter your email address* Subject* Comments* We have all become rather blasé about the ability to see detailed imagery of the earth’s surface from space. Ever since Google acquired the technology developed by Keyhole in 2004, the use of satellite imagery in business has grown steadily. Today, it’s about more than mapping and navigation (which tells you where you are) — the focus is on interpreting the imagery, about understanding what you see. Getting meaningful intelligence from imagery has been a focus of governments and the military intelligence analysts ever since the invention of the camera. Businesses have leveraged the skills of image analysts too — but static image analysis is limited to ‘snapshots” — images that are only representative of the moment they are taken. So Google Earth gets updated only a few times a year. That’s fine of you are interested in identifying events or changes that are seasonal or annual in frequency. But what if you were able to look at the data much more frequently — several times a day, for example? With that level of “granularity” in time, you could see much more detailed patterns of change, identify the drivers of those changes, and plan (or invest, or not) accordingly. That’s never really been possible before, but that’s about to change. Advances in materials, software, electronics, and optics have made it possible to build ultra-small satellites (weighing less than 5 kilograms — compared with more than 2,000 kilograms for traditional Landsat-class vehicles) that can be launched into a variety of low-earth orbits (LEOs), scanning the earth and capturing images and video on an almost continuous basis. Given that it costs around $5,200 per kg to launch a satellite to LEO, this is a huge cost advantage as well as improved coverage. A constellation of 100 or so of these satellites can provide close to 100% coverage, reporting back to earth periodically (to conserve power — always a consideration for small unmanned devices that depend on solar energy). That’s the vision of Planet Labs, founded by former NASA scientists; their “Dove” satellites are ready to go, and there could be 100 or more in orbit by 2018. Now all we need is some imagination in what to do with the image data. Some of the first consumers of this data could be hedge funds — using analytics on retail parking lot activity, oil storage levels, mining activity, and agriculture to predict the health of various economic sectors and their businesses. While this is probably possible (I am not sure all the correlations work or that spoofing won’t occur), it barely scratches the surface of what might be possible as an accumulated picture of close to real-time human activity becomes available. All sorts of innovative analytics could be be applied. Changes in vehicular traffic might predict a shift from suburbs to city centers or vice versa. Time-of-day activity analysis could help optimize staffing at retail, leisure, and hospitality businesses, or influence flexible work hours options. Congestion pricing could be adjusted in real time; tidal flow traffic systems could be more highly automated. Almost any business could combine customer location data (increasingly available via vehicle or smartphone geo-tags) with macro pattern analysis to suggest better times to eat, watch a move, or shop for special offers. This ability to not only know your customer, but to help them avoid congestion and inconvenience has almost limitless possibilities – if you’re ready to integrate the new satellite imagery into existing customer relationship systems, operating infrastructure, and strategic thinking. Is your business ready for the big picture?

First announced at Google I/O in May, the one-to-one video calling application allows users to contact others using their phone numbers. Once users enter and verify their own phone numbers, they can invite other users to video calls by typing their phone numbers or by selecting them from their contacts lists. If a contact hasn’t tried Google Duo, users can send them a text message invite to download the app instead. As users receive calls, the app’s Knock Knock feature will allow them to see live videos of their callers before they answer. All calls on Duo are end-to-end encrypted. While on a call, Google said Duo will adjust the call quality automatically in response to “changing network conditions.” The app will also switch between WiFi and cellular data automatically without ending calls. Google Duo is now rolling out on the iTunes App Store and Google Play. < Previous Article Next Article > Advertisement Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

There’s a new video chat app in town. Google today launched Duo, it’s latest foray into the world of video calling. Google is billing the new app as a simplified alternative to video chat apps already on the market, saying it “takes the complexity out of video calling.” The internet search giant has already been in the video calling business for some time with its Google Hangouts App. How to Find Out What Google Knows About You Google's Search Engine Directs Voters to the Ballot Box Google Reveals the Top Misspelled Word in Every State However, at its Google I/O conference in May, the company said that it would be launching the video app as well as a text messaging app dubbed Allo, to compete with the likes of WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger. Allo has not yet launched, and Google has not set a date. The apps identify users based on their phone numbers, rather than an account with Google, making the experience more similar to that of WhatsApp rather than Facebook Messenger and Apple’s iMessage. Also setting it apart from other apps is a feature Google is calling “Knock Knock,” which shows the call’s receiver a live video of the incoming caller. While Duo is available for both Apple and Android devices, it does not allow users to communicate with desktop users -- another factor differentiating it from Facebook Messenger and iMessage. Google also claims that its new video app is optimized for the mobile experience, and can seamlessly switch between Wi-Fi and cellular connections without the call dropping. Further, the company claims that the video quality will “gracefully reduce” to maintain the call. Another feature worth noting is encryption. Google, which has championed encryption despite concerns that encryption technologies could be used for criminal or terrorist activity, has said that all calls on Duo will be encrypted end-to-end. Duo is available in the United States now, and Google says that it will be available worldwide “in the next few days.” 0 Shares Email Star Comments " Google Launches 'Duo' App in Bid to Make Video Calling Simpler Gov't Wants Phone Makers to Lock out Most Apps for Drivers In a Pond Called Wreck, a New Creation Helps Fish Breed Germany's Top Court Rejects Yahoo Case Over News Royalties A Squirt at 6 Feet: Baby Giraffe to Debut at Los Angeles Zoo In Shift, Trump Says Humans May Be Causing Global Warming Turkey, Football Headline Thanksgiving for 6 Astronauts Zika-Caused Birth Defect May Become Clear Only After Birth Volkswagen Bets on New Technology to Bounce Back From Crisis Get Used to Heat Records; Study Predicts Far More in Future " Trump Walks Fine Ethical Line to White House, Experts Say " Trump's 100-Day Agenda: Experts Examine if It Can Be Done " Wayne State Police Officer in 'Very Grave' Condition After Shooting " Facebook Built 'Censorship Tool' as Part of Chinese Expansion Effort: Report " Thanksgiving Travel Rush: What to Expect Today " Man Injured in Philly Explosion Thought Package Contained Meds: Authorities " Trump 'Seriously Considering' Ben Carson for HUD " Trump 'Leaning' Against Renewed Probe of Clinton, Sources Say " House Republican Criticizes Trump Over Business Conflicts of Interest " Jared Kushner Defends Steve Bannon in Interview, Calls Him an 'Incredible Zionist' " A Look at Gen.

And that could be a boon for Chicago real estate. Google Fiber is fast. Insanely fast. According to tests, Google Fiber can reach download speeds of one gigabyte, or 1,000 megabytes, per second; that is roughly 100 times faster than what most Americans enjoy, and allows users to download large files (a movie, for instance) in less than two minutes. High-speed Internet and homebuyers Having access to that high-speed Internet has become the goal of every big-city mayor in America (Google has been selective in where it installs the service), and for good reason – along with the obvious benefits to the technology sector, there is compelling research that high-speed Internet is good for real estate. A survey from ISPreview found that 71.9 percent of homebuyers would pass on an ideal property if it lacked high-speed broadband, while 22.8 percent said they would negotiate a lower price; only 5.1 percent said they are not bothered by a home’s Internet performance. The “last mile” problem All of that sounds great for Chicago’s economy. Google installs its high-speed Internet, people use it en masse, and then the access to that system becomes as appealing a selling point as convenience to the lakefront and proximity to the L. Except, it’s not quite that simple. The wifi service Google wants to pursue does not have an official name yet because it does not technically exist. Google Fiber, in its current form, it a classic wire-based Internet, meaning it requires running fiberoptic wires to every house and business that wants to utilize it. As Fortune magazine explained, that installation of wiring (called the “last mile” problem) is very expensive, and there is an enormous graveyard of failed Internet companies that were unable to absorb that cost. Google does not release the specific finances behind Fiber, which is part of the fuzzy “other bets” segment of the company’s budget. “Other bets,” though, did run at an operating loss of $859 million in just 2016’s second quarter. Thus, as the Wall Street Journal reported, Google is looking for ways to cut down on its costs, and its new embrace of wifi Internet is part of that initiative. In addition, it has suspended earlier efforts to install Fiber in San Jose and Portland, Ore. The wifi solution, though, will not be immediate. Fortune noted that high-band signals do not travel far, and that historically, they have experienced problems traveling through large buildings. So once Google figures out the next step in its high-speed Internet rollout, the impact will be considerable in Chicago – the big question is when.

Unlikely, but it’s entirely possible, especially if Google’s latest patent for Glass is anything to go by. The company filed for a patent that sees a number of pretty major changes to the design of Google Glass, not only changing the source of the device’s power, but also changing how users would control it. Related: Google Glass lives! And the FCC just leaked photos of the next version As part of the newly filed patent, Google Glass would have a control panel mounted on one of the arms. The panel, according to the patent, is basically a touchpad that would house an electronic circuit and a power source. On the end of the arm would also be found another parts housing. This housing may also contain other components, such as a processor, communications devices, Bluetooth chip, and so on. It would also provide a little more balance to the arm, shifting some of the weight off the nose and onto the ear. Perhaps even more interesting is that the housing includes the ability to connect batteries of multiple forms — whether they be AAA, AA, or even 9-volt. The batteries can be easily replaced and recharged, so if you had multiple sets, you could potentially keep your headset going for as long as you want. Of course, neither of these options necessarily feel like a step forward for Google in the development of Glass. It’s unlikely we’ll ever see a version of Google Glass that uses replaceable batteries — instead, hopefully Google will simply focus its efforts on developing battery tech more. The concept of using a touchpad to control the device is an interesting one. Google Glass was a little difficult to control when it was first released, however it would be nice to see the device have more gesture control and some of the bulk of the headset removed.

Google search now includes info on how to vote Posted Aug 16, 2016 by Sarah Perez (@sarahintampa) 0 SHARES Next Story Facebook fights Messenger spam with Asimov’s three rules of bots Google has rolled out an update to search aimed at helping U.S. users find out how they can vote in the upcoming November election. This includes information on what sort of ID you need to bring with you to your polling places, voting deadlines, details on early voting and mail-in ballots and more. The added guides will appear in Google search when certain phrases are googled, like “how to vote,” for example. The update follows a similar effort released by Google earlier this summer, which was aimed at helping web searchers get registered to vote ahead of the election. In that case, Google began providing information on voting requirements, as well as how to register by mail, online and in person. These guides were also customized based on the user’s location. Similarly, the new “how to vote” information is also specific to the web searcher’s current location. Instead of just posting general guidelines, Google has rolled out state-by-state guides. If need be, you can change the state that appears – based on the location detected by the browser – by selecting a different state from the drop-down box. The new guides will appear in Google search results, and include tabs across the top that let you browse through the “how to” info, requirements, and details on when to vote. This will show you both the early voting dates, as well as the poll hours on Election Day. This section also links you to information on how to get registered. However, Google does not have your individual street address, so it can’t direct you to your exact polling place.   Google notes that since it rolled out the voter registration information last month, it has seen millions of users turning to search for help with this topic. Plus, searches for voter registration are up 190 percent nationwide compared with four years ago, the company says. In addition, Google says it will make the data powering its “how to register to vote” and its “how to vote” search results publicly available, so nonprofits and other organizations focused on voter education and outreach will be able to take advantage of the insights it gains. These groups can fill out a form to request access. Other resources, like this interactive map showing search interest in voter registration over the years, is live now. As we noted previously, Google has been helping web searchers with voting information for some time. It launched an Online Voter Guide a few years ago and has offered web searchers similar voter registration information in years past. More recently, it has worked to help people figure out who to vote for, by introducing real-time responses from the candidates in its search results. The difference between its prior efforts and now, however, is that Google’s voting information is today better formatted for access from mobile devices than before. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Google Founded 1998 Overview Google is a multinational corporation that is specialized in internet-related services and products.

For the past few years it has been working with third-party manufacturers to develop Nexus smartphones and tablets which it directly sells and prioritizes for software updates. A new report claims that the company’s first Google-branded smartphones are going to be released next month. A report out of India claims that Google’s own-brand smartphones are going to be released next month and that too in a handful of countries including India. It also claims that Google will introduce two handsets with 5 inch and 5.5 inch display sizes. Both are said to be running Android Nougat, with 32GB and 128GB storage options. No additional specifications have been confirmed at this point in time. These handsets will reportedly not be marketed under the Nexus brand, rather Google is said to slap its own name on the handsets. It’s unclear who the company’s manufacturing partner is for these devices but it’s speculated that the partner might be HTC. Google hasn’t confirmed or denied anything about this report so take it with a grain of salt until there’s more evidence to suggest that it’s going to release own-brand smartphones in the very near future.

Here's what we think 2016 remains the year that virtual reality came to store shelves. Options like the cost-effective Google Cardboard, the console-specific Playstation VR and the bank account-ruining HTC Vive and Oculus Rift mean there are more options than ever for escaping base reality. And then there was Samsung’s brand of virtual reality: a headset based around inserting your smartphone into the visor that supported Oculus apps and—best of all—cost $99. For many people, especially Samsung owners, this is the most accessible and a good VR option. And with the new version of the Gear VR, the South Korean electronics company is making their offering just a bit better. Xavier Harding Samsung Gear VR Larger trackpad, and a dedicated home button come to the Gear VR 2016 What is the Gear VR? For the uninitiated, Samsung’s Gear VR can be seen as a step above Google’s ultra-affordable Cardboard offering. Both require you to insert a smartphone into an apparatus that you wear on your face. Both use biconvex lenses to let you see your smartphone screen up close and have it look normal—allowing you to enter an environment or even a watch 360-degree video and pan around using just your head. The two headsets offer buttons on the side to let you navigate in virtual worlds. Though anyone who has used both knows that’s where the similarities end. Google Cardboard works with a variety of devices, including Apple’s iPhone. Samsung Gear VR only works with Samsung’s latest phone devices. Devices which, along with usually packing more raw power than a modern iPhone, were created by Samsung with some virtual reality uses in mind. This leads to apps and experiences that are closer to the gaming-like VR headsets than Google Cardboard-brand VR. You won’t get full games like EVE: Valkyrie on the Gear VR, like you will on Oculus and Playstation VR. But the smaller, yet still capable, EVE: Gunjack properly depicts the comparison of what type of games you can get on Gear. Xavier Harding Samsung Gear VR The 2016 edition offers a wider field of view What’s New About This Gear VR? Most of what you’ll find about this Gear VR is very similar to the last. Same design and same features all for the same $99 price. Then what has changed? The most obvious change to the Gear VR is the new darker body. The new Gear VR is best described as dark blue, not quite black. But despite not being as dark as possible, the new dark blue color is already better than the original’s white interior and exterior. While on the outside this makes little difference, the darker insides greatly improve viewing VR content in brightly lit rooms. Before, light from the outside would distract from the game-playing or movie-viewing experience. Samsung has also improved what you’ll see when wearing the Gear. The field of view has increased to 101 degrees, up from 96 previously. Meaning you’ll be able to see a bit more on screen. Another change, most noticeable for owners of the previous Gear VR is a change in port support—a USB C connector and charging port has been swapped for the legacy micro-USB standard, which speaks to the larger point of this device: the Gear VR, along with supporting Note 5, S6 devices and S7 devices, will also be the Gear to support the new Note 7. If you plan on buying this phone, the choice of which Gear VR device you’ll need is an obvious one. Charging the phone while inside the VR headset is possible with the port on the side, but you’ll want to use the Samsung provided cable. Those using older Samsung phones can make use of the micro-USB adapter included in the 2016 Gear VR’s packaging. Xavier Harding Samsung Galaxy Note 7 and Gear VR 2016 The Gear VR 2016's best feature: the Galaxy Note 7 powering it Should I Toss My Current Gear VR And Line Up For This One? Not necessarily. The new version of Samsung’s Gear VR is objectively better than last year’s model—if only for the darker body and increased field of view. But users of both Gear VR units old and new can make use of the same Oculus software (provided they have a relatively new Samsung device). Meaning you can still enjoy Samsung’s great, but not excellent brand of VR. For $99, you won’t be able to walk around video games by moving around your room like the HTC Vive, or play Star Wars Battlefront in VR like on Playstation. But watching Netflix in a personal movie theatre or flying through space shooting aliens adds value to owning a Samsung device. And the price of admission may be worth it alone for the look on your friends' faces when they first enter virtual reality. The most notable change to this Gear VR only takes effect if you have the latest and greatest Samsung device: the new Note 7. Samsung's Note 7’s improved internals like the 5.7-inch AMOLED screen with 518 pixels per inch, 3,500mAh battery and 4GB of RAM are most important to delivering a solid virtual reality experience. Knowing this, the only Samsung buyers that should feel compelled to opt for the new Gear VR are first time Gear VR buyers or new Note 7 buyers. Those currently with a functioning Samsung VR helmet won’t find enough new features to sway towards an upgrade. Though if a better field of view and darker paint job is worth it to you, $99 is a drop in the bucket compared to most virtual reality price tags.

Google recently began work on a new operating system called Fuchsia that isn't based on the Linux kernel. However, it's unclear how it will be used. By Conner Forrest | August 16, 2016, 6:56 AM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus Image: iStockphoto/jessicahyde Pink + Purple == Fuchsia (a new Operating System) So far, the above text is almost all the information available on Google's new Fuchsia OS project, which was recently posted on Google Git and GitHub. But Google hasn't said anything further about the project's intended purpose. The biggest aspect of Fuchsia is the fact that it isn't based on the Linux kernel, which is a foundational piece of both Android and Chrome OS. This fact could point to Google developing a new ecosystem for certain devices, or it could mean the company is gearing up to move away from Android and Chrome in the future. Instead of the Linux kernel, Fuchsia is built on the Magenta kernel, which Android Police pointed out is based on the LittleKernel (LK) project. According to the LK GitHub page, it is described as: "An SMP-aware kernel designed for small systems." Although, according to Google, there are three core differences between Magenta and LK: Magenta has first class user-mode support. LK does not. Magenta is an object-handle system. LK does not have either concept. Magenta has a capability-based security model. In LK, all code is trusted. SEE: Mobile app development policy template (Tech Pro Research) According to Google documentation: "Magenta targets modern phones and modern personal computers with fast processors, non-trivial amounts of ram with arbitrary peripherals doing open ended computation."

However, Fuchsia also supports 64-bit PCs, and seems to be focused on scaling more efficiently across more types of devices. It could even have Raspberry Pi 3 support in the future. This all, in turn, raises the question of just what is Google doing with this new Fuchsia OS? An OS that could span IoT and embedded devices, but also work well with PCs and smartphones seems logical, but it also seems very similar to what Google tried to accomplish with Brillo and Weave a little while back, which was derived from Android. But, there do seem to be some marked differences between Fuchsia and the Brillo/Weave/Android project. Another possibility is that Fuchsia could be the replacement for both Android and Chrome OS, instead of the company merging the two, as has been rumored for years. Although that also seems like a conflicting idea, due to the fact that Google just made a bunch of Android apps available on Chrome. The only thing certain about Fuchsia right now is that nothing is certain. This could just be an experiment that gets shuttered next week, but it also could be something big. Update: A Google spokesperson said that the company wasn't sharing any details on Fuchsia at this time. However, they did say "this is a new open source project that is NOT at all related to Android or Chrome OS (which you may have seen the rumors). As you know, we have many revolving open source projects at Google." What do you think? What do you think Google will do with Fuchsia? Tell us in the comments or on Twitter. The 3 big takeaways for TechRepublic readers Google recently began working on a new OS named Fuchsia, that is not based on the Linux kernel like Chrome OS and Android are. Fuchsia is based on the Magenta kernel, and seems to show signs of being used in IoT and embedded devices, but also scalable across some smartphones and PCs. Fuchsia could end up replacing Android and Chrome, or complement them as an additional OS, or it could just be an experiment that gets shut down before it sees the light of day.

Nashville Mayor Wants Google, Comcast, AT&T To Sit Down And Make Nice Over Fiber Plans Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Nashville Mayor Wants Google, Comcast, AT&T To Sit Down And Make Nice Over Fiber Plans Image courtesy of Adam Fagen August 16, 2016 10:59 am EST By Kate Cox@kcoxdc now shake hands google fiber comcast at&t broadband competition nashville Incumbent cable and telecom companies push back hard when Google wants to come to town with Fiber service. But while corporations file legal challenges and yell at each other by proxy, residents are stuck in the middle without competitive service. That’s what’s going on in Nashville right now, more or less: Google Fiber is trying to come to town, and to support building infrastructure, Nashville’s local government is considering a new regulation about utility pole access. AT&T and Comcast both came out swinging against any new rule, with Comcast specifically saying, “We believe that the appropriate next step would be to conduct a meeting of stakeholders” before any new legislation gets made. It seems Nashville mayor Megan Barry is calling them on that bluff. As The Tennessean reports, following a contentious city council meeting Barry has called for all the stakeholders to convene to find a resolution. Under existing law, the Tennessean explains, AT&T and Comcast would have to move their lines before any competitor’s lines can be added — something they are probably not terrible interested in doing. The new proposal would give anyone seeking to add lines (in this case, Google Fiber) permission to hire an approved vendor to move all the lines at once. AT&T and Comcast do not want the policy changed; Google does. In fact, the internet giant says, the ability to bring service to Nashville as promised hinges entirely on it. “Worst-case scenario is either elongation or it just ceases to happen,” a Google official told the city council. If Google doesn’t get access to the utility poles it will, indeed, drastically slow down the company’s ability to come to town. As The Tennesseean reports, 90% of the city is built on top of hard limestone soil that makes it difficult to put cables underground and so utility poles are the best alternative. Barring that, it seems Nashville could find itself on the ever-growing list of potential Google Fiber cities waiting for the invention of new wireless tech instead.

News & Analysis Google Partners with Pharma Giant on 'Bioelectronic' Meds Peter Clarke 8/16/2016 09:36 AM EDT 2 comments NO RATINGS Login to Rate Tweet LONDON—The company formerly known as Google Life Sciences LLC and GlaxoSmithKline plc (Brentford, England) have agreed to form a joint venture to develop bioelectronics including such technologies as implanted neurostimulators. Galvani Bioelectronics Ltd. will be headquartered in the UK and GSK will own 55% and Verily Life Sciences LLC, previously Google Life Sciences, will own 45%. The two parent companies are contributing existing intellectual property and plan to invest up to $700 million (about £540 million) in Galvani over the next seven years subject to the company meeting discovery and development milestones, GSK said. GSK has been active in bioelectronics since 2012 and said it believes that chronic conditions such as arthritis, diabetes and asthma could potentially be treated using electronic stimulation of nerve pathways. Initial work will focus on establishing clinical proofs of principle in inflammatory, metabolic and endocrine disorders, including type 2 diabetes, and developing associated miniaturised, precision devices. Moncef Slaoui, GSK’s Chairman of Global Vaccines, who was instrumental in establishing GSK’s investments in the field of bioelectronics, will chair the board of the new company. He said: "Many of the processes of the human body are controlled by electrical signals firing between the nervous system and the body’s organs, which may become distorted in many chronic diseases. Bioelectronic medicine’s vision is to employ the latest advances in biology and technology to interpret this electrical conversation and to correct the irregular patterns found in disease states, using miniaturised devices attached to individual nerves. If successful, this approach offers the potential for a new therapeutic modality alongside traditional medicines and vaccines." Galvani Bioelectronics will be fully consolidated in GSK's financial statements and headquartered within GSK’s global R&D centre at Stevenage in the UK, with a second research hub at Verily’s facilities in South San Francisco. It will initially employ around 30 expert scientists, engineers and clinicians. The deal is expected to close before the end of 2016. Article originally published on EE Times Europe.

Apple has proferred its superior devices, like the iPhone. Google has fought back with its Android operating system and a series of mobile apps ,” Brian X. Chen reports for The New York Times. “On Tuesday, Google underscored that strategy with the release of its latest mobile app: Duo, a video-calling app that is a direct alternative to Apple’s FaceTime.” “People can only use FaceTime to call others who have Apple devices. But Duo lets you place video calls between Android and iPhone users, and sizably increases the universe of people with whom you can hold a video conversation,” Chen reports. “All of this feeds into Google’s strategy to attract iPhone users over to Android. Google’s apps generally work better on Android devices than on iPhones, so the more that people get hooked on Google’s core apps, the less incentive there is to stay loyal to Apple.” “Last month, Timothy D. Cook, Apple’s chief executive, repeatedly highlighted that the rate at which people were switching from Android-based devices to iPhones was the highest the company had seen,” Chen reports. “‘Our year-to-date iPhone sales to switchers are the greatest we’ve seen in any nine-month period,’ Mr. Cook said in the call, without disclosing precise figures.” “For now, FaceTime is just as intuitive as Duo so I see no compelling reason to use Duo over FaceTime to call iPhone users,” Chen reports. “But if I had to video call an Android user, I would use Duo over other video-calling services like Skype or Facebook Messenger, which have more cluttered interfaces than Duo’s single-button approach.” Read more in the full article here.

My kid has an old cheap alcatel android phone, total POS but he is only 10 and loves the idea that he has a *cell phone* even though it only works on home wireless. This should make it easier to chat with him when i’m away. At the least he’ll get a kick out of it. Predrag Tuesday, August 16, 2016 - 11:06 am · Reply I’m not sure how smart that is. I totally understand the reasoning behind spending minimum on a cheap phone for a 10-year old (and I don’t want to go into the debate regarding the appropriate minimum age for a smartphone), but for me, being a father of two girls, I have serious misgivings about giving an Android to a child. The device has no built-in parental controls, not to mention there is no way for me to ensure (s)he won’t side-load apps of very questionable origin, bringing in malware of all sorts. When my daughters reach the age I consider appropriate for a smartphone, they will get an iPhone (perhaps a used one, three model-years old, such as 5s today), which I can completely control. I can then disable app download without my explicit approval, restrict content ratings in Safari and elsewhere, and make their initial smartphone experience a bit more controlled one. Even without ANY parental controls and restrictions, iPhone is still a much safer choice, as it doesn’t allow side-loading of apps from problematic sources, which prevents inadvertent installation of malware. In my school, kids (5th grade through high school) all get MacBook Airs. In my friend’s school, they get Windows. Our kids are of similar age, and while mine has had her MBA for the past four years, she has yet to encounter malware, while my friend has battled all sorts of Windows viruses over the past three years, re-formatting that laptop twice already. Android isn’t much better in the hands of kids when it comes to malware. I would rather not take that chance, just to save $50 over a used 5S. silverwarloc Tuesday, August 16, 2016 - 12:14 pm · Reply I started my two girls with iPhones when they came out.

Apple (Jobs) promised Facetime would be an open standard, then reneged. Chas Tuesday, August 16, 2016 - 11:02 am · Reply The answer is spherical, and in the plural. =:~) Predrag Tuesday, August 16, 2016 - 11:14 am · Reply Nothing will ever be able to approach the simplicity of FaceTime, due to its deep and complete integration into the iOS. You don’t facetime people by opening FaceTime ap and looking up their names. You intuitively do that from your phone app. It is the natural thing to do: you want to call someone, you open up your phone; there, you have your speed-dial list, your last call list, and your contacts. From any one of these, you can find the person you want to call and instead of dialing their number the old-fashioned way (by tapping the phone icon), you simply tap on the FaceTime icon and the call is made. Even the ringtone (for the recipient) is the same as when getting a phone call. To use this ‘Duo’, you’d have to go into a different app, and that makes it no different from Skype, Viber, ooVoo, Tango, Peer, Google Hangouts… And all of those already have a long and well-established track record.

Those ANALyst never learn. I am not saying this google feature won’t work, I am just saying that 99.99% some one predicts something will kill something from apple and they are wrong, but when ever apple release a new device or feature that will kill some other device or even a company, those poor brainless bastards predict apple will fail. I won’t ask “when are they going to learn” because I just learn that they won’t ever. Gotcha Tuesday, August 16, 2016 - 1:22 pm · Reply Well that was a doozy of disinformation. I’ll pick just one… “Google’s apps generally work better on Android devices than on iPhones” More fully featured maybe but work better? My standard test of processing muscle is Google’s own highly capable photo editing app Snapseed. Any time someone says “look how fast my Amdroid phone is” I get them to download the app and do the same Save an editable copy with some heavy processing. My iPhone 6 wins hands down sometimes by half a minute or so. It never takes more than 5 or 6 seconds. My son-in-law’s new Sammy S7 can’t match Apples two year old processing capability.

But in a Quora thread, Matt Cutts, who is now with the U.S. Digital Service team, but the former Google web spam lead, said it was a United Airlines employee that may have triggered him into that role. He said: I had read a book called The Cluetrain Manifesto that included a story of an employee at United Airlines answering questions and helping people. Later I saw a few people discussing Google on a webmaster forum, including a few conspiracy theories like “If you buy Google ads, you’ll rank {higher, lower} on Google.” I asked Google’s PR team if it would be okay if I occasionally answered some questions or debunked misconceptions on that webmaster forum, and they said yes. So I registered an account as “GoogleGuy” on Oct. 8, 2001 and started replying and answering questions in my free time. I think I eventually chalked up 2800+ posts on that forum. I had already helped the PR team with a couple Google stories, and I was working in an area (webspam/search) where I could often assist on incoming questions. So between knowing the area and getting a lot of communications practice online, I kind of backed into the role. From posting on that webmaster forum, I started my blog in 2005 so I could answer questions with a permalink under my control. Then eventually we started doing webmaster videos. External communications became my unofficial 20% project, even though search quality and webspam were always my highest priorities. The person behind GoogleGuy was a mystery for years. That all changed when Google became more public and transparent about search. Now there is are teams at Google devoted to do what Matt Cutts did in his 20% time. Overall, I think we are better off now. I will say it again, I do miss Matt Cutts. Don't get me wrong, I love the webmaster trends team but I do think we have a bit of a void with Cutts gone. Having John, Gary, Maile and others with Matt Cutts is much better than without Matt Cutts. Forum discussion at Quora. Image credit to Thos Ballantyne who I also miss seeing.

Art Enke 08/16/2016 09:37 pm Terry - Google has created wealth for billions of people, including your crappy little agency in S. Africa. Show some respect man. noneya 08/16/2016 11:37 pm how old are you sir? because in your pic you look like over 60 but your post reads like a freshman in college majoring in philosophy who's about to fail the semester because of spending too much time on reddit PandaBalls 08/17/2016 05:38 am "Bit of a void". Understatement. All we get is one liners and wise ass little quips. PandaBalls 08/17/2016 05:39 am Get help son. Seriously. Call a helpline or something you are one angry misinformed being.

John 08/17/2016 08:13 am Matt Cutt done good job in his life, no one can blame to Matt Cutt. you can blame to muller but i think you should not blame to Matt Cutts , Google was doing best that time when Matt cutts was working..... @disqus_MJxbd6VqKm:disqus John 08/17/2016 08:15 am Barry, is their filter in comment ? or anyone can comment anything here? i noticed that mostly comments are just like TERRY. no one talk about seo, mostly comment about Google lie.... John 08/17/2016 08:26 am No one earned so much respect than to Matt cutt in Google. after going Matt Cutts but one thing that if Google is going this path then Google will certainly out of market because Google is screwing to bloggers, article sites. article,blog were main reason which made Popular to Google and now Mostly Bloggers and Article sites are not earning. if NO Article SITES = NO GOOGLE.......... and Google is slowly going on that path...

Jerry B. 08/17/2016 11:59 am So sad and angry because of your own delusions. This is what happens when you fill your head with myths and conspiracy theories instead of facts, people. Jerry B. 08/17/2016 12:01 pm Please do. I'm sure it will be hilarious when everyone points out all the reasons you failed (which have nothing to do with some big evil boogie man.) Nick Ker 08/17/2016 03:01 pm That's Cyber sauce. Sorry. I just get a chuckle out of anyone who says cyber-anything and expects to be taken seriously. I mean, even clueless TV anchors stopped saying "cyber" about anything other than maybe when they want to scare people about intergovernmental hacking from Iran or China. Yet here's cyber-Terry and his cyber-SEO agency fighting Google's Cyber Beasts. Terry 08/18/2016 04:38 pm That's why Google filtered your crap site in the begging, its pure spam and full of crap, thin content fill of nonsensical crap comments like the one you just gave Barry Schwartz 08/18/2016 04:40 pm Mistakes happen.

News Technology Google Duo: Tech giant releases new video chat app to rival FaceTime Tom Powell Tuesday 16 August 2016 11:31 BST Google Duo is designed to rival FaceTime Google Google has launched its own video chat app to rival FaceTime, Skype and Messenger. Google Duo, released today, is a free app available for Android phones as well as iPhones. The new app is similar in many ways to the highly popular FaceTime, which is only available on iPhones, except the “knock, knock” feature will allows users a look at the person making the call before answering. Calls are encrypted and the video resolution changes depending on the connection speed. Read more How to free up space on your iPhone without deleting your apps Google embroiled in Palestine 'airbrush' maps row Google employee Vanessa Marcotte found dead after going jogging in woods A Google statement said:  “Video calling is the next best thing to being with someone in person, but too often it can be a frustrating or complicated experience. “You shouldn’t have to worry about whether your call will connect, or if your friend is using the same type of device as you are. It’s no wonder that nearly half of us never make video calls on mobile.” Google has been offering a video call service through Hangouts since 2013, but that is now being specifically tailored for business meetings. Duo is the first of two new mobile apps from the American firm, with a messaging app called Allo set to be released over the next few months. Allo features a robotic assistant who suggests automated responses to messages, or even pictures, sent by friends.

Note: At the moment, SMS verification seems to only work in the US, so if you don’t have a US number, you will likely have Google announced the Duo video chat app (and the messaging app Allo) at Google I/O this year, saying only that we’d see the final release later this summer.

The Note 7 is a direct successor to the Note 5, with Samsung opting to skip the '6' to bring the Note series in sync with their 'S' line of devices. Priced at Rs. 59.900, the Note 7 is one of the costliest devices available in the market today. Just like previous generations, the Note 7 is loaded with top notch specs, with the Indian version getting Samsung's home-grown Exynos 8890 chipset, 4GB of RAM and 64GB of inbuilt storage. The device does have expandable storage however. Samsung's famed S-Pen makes a return with even more features, including the ability to record a GIF of a selected part of the screen, and this time around the device is waterproof as well. The company has also given the Note 7 an edge screen and an iris scanner for rapid and secure unlocking. Google working on new operating system According to Google's online code and GitHub, the Mountain View-based search giant may be working on a new operating system, called Fuchsia. Details are scarce at the moment, but the big takeaway is that the new OS is not based on Linux, making it different from Android and Chrome OS, the two major offerings from the company. Based on available information, Fuchsia seems designed to run on all kinds of devices and be scalable for any task required of it. This has led to many speculations, ranging from one that says it could power Google's push towards enhancing the Internet of Things (IoT), and power devices like their OnHub router, to another which assumes Fuchsia may one day replace both Android and Chrome OS and serve as a single unified ecosystem. The team behind it say that Fuchsia will also be completely open-source, so we are bound to hear more sooner rather than later. MIT students create smartphone-controlling tattoo Designs etched onto the body that can be used to control devices are now a reality. Students from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Media Lab teamed up with researchers from Microsoft Research to create DuoSkin, a temporary tattoo that can work like a touchpad. It can be made in different designs and peeled off whenever the wearer wants. The tattoo can also be designed t ochange its colour based on temperature. Trending online: No Man's Sky The Pokemon Go fever has barely stabilised, and the Internet already has a new game to discuss and dissect. Indie developer Hello Games has been ruling the headlines this week with No Man's Sky, a game that throws players into a sprawling, procedurally-generated galaxy with one mission: get to its centre. Players start on an isolated planet (the developers claim the game universe has over a quintillion planets, meaning all the players in the game may go through the entire game without finding one another), and have to craft, survive, trade and fight their way to other worlds. Initial reviews have expressed awe at the scale and diversity of the game, though it's repetitive mechanics and unpolished interface have also come under fire. If you're looking for a new title to play, No Man's Sky definitely seems worth a look.

Google begins the how to vote feature in Google Search on Tuesday, Aug. 16, 2016, pulling another lever on its influential search engine in an effort to boost voter turnout in November's U.S. presidential election. (Google via AP) .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... ..........SAN FRANCISCO — Google is pulling another lever on its influential search engine in an effort to boost voter turnout in November’s U.S. presidential election. Beginning Tuesday, Google will provide a summary box detailing state voting laws at the top of the search results whenever a user appears to be looking for that information. The breakdown will focus on the rules particular to the state where the search request originates unless a user asks for another location. Google is introducing the how-to-vote instructions a month after it unveiled a similar feature that explains how to register to vote in states across the U.S. The search giant said its campaign is driven by rabid public interest in the presidential race between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. As of last week, it said, the volume of search requests tied to the election, the candidates and key campaign issues had more than quadrupled compared to a similar point in the 2012 presidential race. Advertisement Continue reading TURNOUT EFFECTS It’s difficult to predict whether Google’s efforts will have a major impact on how many people cast ballots, says Michael McDonald, a University of Florida political scientist who closely studies election turnout. That’s because Google will narrowly target its voting instructions to people who are actively seeking that information. Sample requests that will elicit a helping hand from Google include “what do I need to vote,” “when can I vote,” “what is the absentee ballot deadline” and “can I vote by mail.” The summary boxes won’t appear for broader requests pertaining to the election, such as “Clinton” or “Trump.” That means Google may primarily end up helping out “politically engaged” people who’d be likely to cast a November ballot even without prodding from the world’s most popular search engine. “It’s an open question on how large the positive effect will be,” McDonald said. ONLINE PRODDING Other online services have previously tried to encourage more people to vote. In the November 2010 midterm election, for instance, Facebook posted a “get out the vote” message in the news feeds of about 60 million people on its social network. A University of California at San Diego study of that Facebook effort estimated it boosted voter turnout by about 340,000 people. Google will also release its registration and voting guides to nonprofit groups and other organizations aiming to get more people to the polls this November. The company said it considers its voting tools to be a nonpartisan public service, although swings in voter turnout have swayed past elections. McDonald, though, says it is always difficult to predict which candidate in an election stands to gain the most from an increase in voter turnout. As an example, he suggests, Google’s effort could easily help increase the number of younger people more inclined to vote for Clinton — or put more ballots in the hands of less educated, disillusioned citizens backing Trump.

The app was first announced in May of 2016, but officially launched in both the Google Play Store and iTunes App Store this week. The app works with the user’s contacts list and phone number, so users don’t need a separate Google account to use it. The app has a feature called “Knock Knock” that lets the person receiving the call see a live video preview of the person calling to quickly get a sense of the nature of the call. Video calling is the next best thing to being with someone in person, but too often it can be a frustrating or complicated experience. You shouldn’t have to worry about whether your call will connect, or if your friend is using the same type of device as you are. It’s no wonder that nearly half of us never make video calls on mobile*.

WIRE Google Video Calling Is Here: What You Should Know The high tech giant's Duo app is joining a crowded video calling field. By Associated Press WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement Knock, knock,  Google's video chatting app has arrived. The app, dubbed Duo, represents Google's response to other popular video calling options, including Apple's FaceTime, Microsoft's Skype and Facebook's Messenger app. Duo isn't much different from the other video chatting services, except that it gives a glimpse at who is making the call, helping the recipient decide whether to answer. Google calls this feature, "Knock, knock." The new app, announced in May, is being released Tuesday as a free service for phones running on Google's Android operating system as well as Apple's iPhones. Like FaceTime for iPhones, Duo only requires a person's phone number to connect. Many other services require both participants to have account logins to use their video calling options. Google has been offering video calling through its Hangout feature for several years, but the internet company is now tailoring that service for business meetings. Duo is being billed as a simpler, more reliable way to see friends and family as you talk to them. It is the first of two new mobile apps that Google, owned by Alphabet Inc., has planned for this summer. The Mountain View, California, company also is preparing to unveil a new messaging app called Allo featuring a robotic assistant that will suggest automated responses to texts. --Associated Press Published on: Aug 16, 2016 Advertisement

The app offers up a basic video calling experience, but is compatible across iOS and Android, allowing users of mobile’s two most popular operating systems to communicate with one another via simplified Facetime/Skype-like calls. Unfortunately, Duo does not connect with Google’s other popular apps like Google Chat, Hangouts, Spaces or even Google’s upcoming messaging platform Allo. This means that users will have to create their contact list from scratch with Duo. It’s also worth noting that, according to reports, Duo’s marquee ‘knock knock’ feature, shown off at I/O, doesn’t work in the iOS version of the video calling app. In the Android version of Duo with Knock Knock enabled, when a contact calls via Duo, you’re able to view a live video preview of that individual before answering. This feature doesn’t work on iOS because Apple does not allow third-party developers access to the iPhone’s lockscreen. The app’s user interface is reportedly barren, though that seems to be the company’s intention; creating a simplified video calling app without fancy features. Duo does, however, make Google’s already muddled messaging app ecosystem even more confusing, with its various chat apps operating independently of each other. Additionally, since users have to start using the platform from scratch, some people may be more inclined to continue using more established chat services like Skype or Facetime instead. With the launch of Duo, it seems Google is pivoting Hangouts to be more focused on enterprise services. While Hangouts was once one of the best messaging platforms roughly five to six years ago, it’s been eclipsed by countless other services, including Facebook-owned WhatsApp and Messenger. In many ways, Google launching Duo this late in the video chat game is the tech giant playing catch up. Duo will soon be available globally on iOS and Android for free. We’ve confirmed with Google Canada that the iOS and Android version of the app is currently rolling out across Canada. While nothing has been confirmed yet, it’s likely that Allo, Google’s new messaging app, will launch in the near future as well. SourceGoogle danbob333 Useless. Hangouts supports video calls just fine. Google is shooting itself in the foot. thereasoner Hangouts is reportedly going to change its focus to business use. Jon Moore Doesn’t work very well, is difficult to get non-googlers to use, has a ton of issues with latency, even in Canada when both parties are on business grade high speed. Minh umm… it’s not coming… it’s here……… Patrick O’Rourke For some users perhaps, but we haven’t been able to download it yet. John W Available to side load from Apkmirror… I downloaded this but I don’t see myself using it… I don’t video chat much and Facebook messenger works just fine when I do. Daniel Lui It’s not in the Canadian App Store yet. It’s currently only in the US App Store. Even on the Google Play store, it’s listed as coming soon with the option to pre-register for the app if you’re interested. Josh Brown Download on apkmirror. Works perfect. Minh ah, I have two accounts linked to my phone; a Canadian and a US one. Got it from the play store…US I guess Brad Fortin “While Hangouts was once one of the best messaging platforms roughly five to six years ago” Except Google officially launched Hangouts during the Google I/O conference on May 15, 2013, 3 years ago. Might want to revise that timeline. craig0r But it’s technically existed for much longer, as Google Chat, or GChat. Maybe that’s what they’re talking about… but I agree, at the very least, the wording isn’t quite accurate. gommer strike But a key difference was this. GChat had a full windows client(I loved it) which supported many chat-centric functions such as being able to flag yourself as “away” and stuff we’ve all grown to love from desktop chat clients. It was fast, lightweight, and everything I loved. Sure there were a lot of things it didn’t support, but it was fine. Then they moved over to hangouts which had a much worse Windows UI, and overall a pretty cludgy interface. While technically hangouts is a superior product, the UI left a bit to be desired. And now they’re breaking hangouts up so to speak? sigh. Brad Fortin I don’t think those two are interchangeable, though. Google Talk used the XMPP protocol, which was an open standard, whereas Hangouts uses a proprietary protocol that isn’t compatible. Mikie what do you expect from mobile syrup.. lol.. fresh out of journalism school .. lol or poached from sun media FlamesFan89 I am still baffled why Duo and Allo exist at all. It seems very backwards to me, to have multiple clients like this. Even if they were unhappy with Hangouts, and wanted to replace it, why not a single app that has text and video messaging rolled together, and while you are at it, include sms… Oh wait, we had that with Hangouts until they decided to screw it all up. Again, I really don’t get this move. I wish someone could put together some sort of line of reasoning that makes any sense at all. MeHow Very good point. Google surprises me – they are pedaling back for some time now. Video calling exists in Hangouts thou. Why another app? It’s Me Mostly agree with you, but we don’t know what was happening behind the scenes. It’s very possible that the Hangout’s code base was such a mess that it was decided it would be better to just start from scratch, possibly also with a PM decision to scale back on a holistic service and go with better implemented discrete services. Also, Google is well known for being a bit cowboy with products and services, almost to the point of being rash or premature. This might just be more of that. FlamesFan89 Like I said, even if you need to make a new app, that’s fine, but why separate it all out. If you ask me, Apple nailed it with iMessages (or whatever it is called). When a user messages someone, if they have the app, it goes through as an iMessage, but if they don’t, it goes through as an SMS. As I understand it, it is nearly invisible to the end user, as it should be. Is Facetime built into iMessages? or is it a separate app? I honestly have no idea. I don’t know, I just get the sense that this is very poorly planned. My experience is that if you try to tell people, especially non-techie people, “Hey, there is a new video messaging app” they will respond by saying they already use such-and-such app, and basically forget that you ever even brought it up, and go on their merry way. That is just exacerbated by the fact that Google is now saying there are TWO new apps, one for messages and one for videos. Seems like they are making the hill to adoption, both taller and steeper at the same time. It’s Me FaceTime is a separate app and service from iMessage, but a FaceTime call can be initiated from within iMessage. Like I said, I mostly agree with you. There is often a strong argument from a more holistic approach, trying to be more and do more. But at the same time, that can often be a problem. Sometimes it’s better to do fewer things well than to do lots of things poorly. Jack of all trades and master of none type of thing. At some point, as feature bloat gets out of control, you just need to step back, start over and be disciplined in controlling bloat. Separating core features into their own apps in one way of doing that. I’m not saying that was the case here, but to me it sure looks like that was the thinking. FlamesFan89 Yeah, that all makes sense. I like that option to open Facetime from within iMessage. That makes perfect sense. I think what massively helps is that those are core apps that come on every single iPhone. Contrast that to Android. Some come with Hangouts, but I don’t think all do. But aside from that, they all have one app or another for SMS. They may or may not have a video chat app, but certainly nothing standard. I get (and like and appreciate) that with Android the idea is that the emphasis is on choice, but I think that if Google wanted to hit these apps out of the park, they would make Allo and Duo be absolutely standard/core on Android, so that every phone has them, making it really easy to get people using them. As it is, I see these dying on the vine in short order. hunter2 Going beyond that; if they really, really needed to make a new app that was more simple and stripped down, why not use the same protocols so that a Duo user could contact a hangouts user and an Allo user could message a hangouts user? If you need to make a new app because you think the old one is too confusing for users, why do you need to also change the back end server side stuff that is completely invisible to users? Orage42 Maybe they could’ve implemented it – maybe not – the main difference is that you can register through DUO with your phone number instead of a google account. stevedion I agree, had to explain this to my non techy son whom I had just installed Hangouts on his iPhone a month ago . So which app do I use now? Roger Hangouts and Skype is fine enough for me. No need for another app. eszklar The Duo APK is already on the APKMirror website. I installed it on my Zenfone 5 an hour ago. Edit: What John W has already posted below. RjPiston I liked it when hangouts had SMS integration… video, chat, sms, mms all in one multi platform app(only thing missing was sms syncing to desktop app)… now they are all different apps, different contact lists, attached to a phone number….why did they want to change this!? Moosen My guess as to why this exists is that Allo is being primed to work as a total replacement for SMS amongst carriers. Since Allo (or Duo for that matter) don’t really have a shot against rival apps on their own, it would seem that replacing SMS completely would be Google’s way of shoehorning itself in as a contender in communication. With that completed they can run Duo alongside Allo for more usage and/or success. Again, just my guess. theycallmeWat? Possibly. But why when they released Messenger <2 years ago. Why not just improve Messenger or build whatever functionality Allo will have into it? I agree with others here that it seems Google keeps releasing multiple apps that in one way or another do the same thing. Yes it's great for choice but I'm guessing for most it just adds confusion, and even frustration. Moosen Definitely confusing. Hangouts + SMS integration seemed to have confused people, prompting the release of Messenger. Many Android oems named their own messaging app “Messenger,” further confusing folks. If this SMS replacement deal happens I assume a branding “clean slate” was called for. GQDRU The app is not rolling out across Canada. I registered for Google Duo months ago on 3 separate Android devices and it does not show available for download! theycallmeWat? Same here… my guess is that registration was for Google to gauge interest in the app rather than to grant early access Cormango I hope these new apps help with my contact list mess. One thing I miss about my Windows Phone was that Microsoft took care of linking all my contacts. My Android device’s contact list is an absolute mess. Does Duo and Allo just add to the mess? Ratue i don’t know what all the fuss is about. It just simply works, and works quite well. Bobby Russelo It’s now available! First impression is meh… Doesnt appear to be anything special RambleMan Duo was originally announced as being encrypted end-to-end, but I see no mention of that in the App listing on the Play Store. One would think if it existed, they’d mention it. Is it encrypted? Shawn End-to-end encryption is available if you make a ‘secure’ conversation. Otherwise, it’s encrypted in transit, and on Google’s servers. You cannot have bots in an end-to-end encrypted conversation. Only regularly secured and encrypted-on-the-wire conversations. Mawhayden I still would have preferred, it be intergrated within Google Hanouts. I have a feeling that Google is doing the same thing as Breaking out Facebook messaging. At this point, I will continue with Facebook and or FaceTime. By the way, not a great fan of talking and showing your face at the same time…. Mikie Useless indeed.

Featured Story: Amazon's Best Black Friday Tech Deals 2016—TVs, Phones & Tablets Smartphones: help for cell phones, pdas, iphones, android, and more — WonderHowTo News: Google Finally Launches Duo—Here's Why You Should Give the New Video Chat App a Try Dallas Thomas 3 months ago Google Finally Launches Duo—Here's Why You Should Give the New Video Chat App a Try Google's new cross-platform video chat app, Duo, is finally making its debut today, following a long waiting period that began in late May. The app was heavily teased during the keynote speech at Google I/O, but was not made available for download until now, so any early hype Google managed to whip up has died down quite a bit. But don't let the poorly-timed release ruin all of the fun, because Duo actually has a lot to offer. The cross-platform video calling app just might have the best picture quality you can get when making video calls between an iPhone and Android device—and now that the app is finally available for Android and iOS, it's certainly worth a download. Duo Explained Duo's headlining feature is definitely the video quality—perhaps the best you'll see with a cross-platform mobile app. It's packed to the brim with software optimizations that will keep the feed going in crystal-clear HD quality, to an extent that has only been seen with Apple's exclusive FaceTime app in the past. This was made possible by Google's own WebRTC video framework, which can maintain HD quality even when you only have a 2G data connection. But Duo has another trick up its sleeve with a feature called "Knock Knock." When you receive a video call, you'll see a live feed of the other user's camera before you even answer, giving you a glimpse of the conversation to come. Google hopes this will make the service more engaging for users, but that remains to be seen. But, of course, this isn't a perfect app. For starters, it's yet another app that you'll have to convince your friends to install, which is always a struggle. But at least there's no signup involved, since the service relies only on your phone number to identify you. And aside from the call quality and Knock Knock, there really aren't many standout features. No fancy video filters, overlays, or face swapping is involved here, as Google intentionally built Duo to be as simple as possible. Google's new Duo app features high-quality video, previews of incoming calls, and an intentionally simple interface. Images via Google Install Duo on Android or iOS Duo will begin rolling out to all iOS and Android users on August 16, but it may take a few days before the download link goes live in your area. So to try the new service, simply head to the install page for your phone's operating system linked below, and if it's not available yet, just keep checking back. Install Google Duo for iPhone from the iOS App Store Install Google Duo for Android from the Google Play Store As an alternative, impatient Android users can sideload the app right now. But before you grab the APK, you'll need to find your device's CPU architecture and DPI value. With that information in hand, just head to the link below, then download and install the right version—but as a note to international users, Duo is only allowing U.S. and Canada phone numbers to register for the first few days. Sideload Google Duo from APKMirror One final note—there's no word yet on Allo, the other app Google teased at I/O. The new messaging service features deep Google Assistant integration, and it may take a while before this AI-powered framework is ready for prime time, so that's probably what's keeping Allo on the shelf until further notice.

T Published: 17:10 August 16, 2016 Reuters   SMALL MEDIUM LARGE Bengaluru: Google on Tuesday launched Google Duo, pitting it directly against Apple Inc's FaceTime, which allows video calls only between Apple devices. Now, all you need is a phone number to start a video call with any contact who uses an Android- or iOS-based smartphone. Duo will also compete with Microsoft Corp's/svideo-calling app Skype, Facebook Inc's Messenger and even its own Hangout app. Duo comes with a unique feature called "knock knock", which lets a person to see live video of a caller before answering. (http://bit.ly/2bv08Un) Google said video calls would work even on slower networks by "gracefully" reducing the resolution to keep the call going smoothly. "For video calls on the go, Duo will switch between Wi-Fi and cellular data automatically without dropping your call," Justin Uberti, principal software engineer, wrote in a blog post. Google, owned by Alphabet Inc, said the app would be live worldwide in the next few days.   More from Technology UAE e-tailers slash prices to boost sales 04:32 pm UAE, Saudi Arabia top video consumption charts 03:42 pm Extradition of Russian hacker sought 03:09 pm Cybercrime cost UAE Dh5.14b this year Mideast ICT spending to grow 3.6% Lenovo launches first AR-enabled smartphone Symantec to buy LifeLock for $2.3 billion Alibaba-Meraas opens Dubai data centre tags from this storyGoogle follow this tag on MGN filed underGulfNewsBusinessSectorsTechnology tagsGoogle follow this tag on MGN+ MGN Also In TechnologyUAE e-tailers slash prices to boost sales Business Gallery Highlights: Guangzhou Auto Show 2016 Kish island turns to be a major tourism hub Business Videos PlayStrata UAE leads aerospace manufacturing Video: Electronics fiesta as Gitex opens FOLLOW US Most Popular ViewedCommentedVideosPictures 01Cybercrime cost UAE Dh5.14b this year 02$81m cyberheist: 5 bankers charged 03Alibaba-Meraas opens Dubai data centre Play Strata UAE leads aerospace manufacturing Oct 25, 2016 Play Video: Electronics fiesta as Gitex opens Oct 01, 2016 Play Emirates Group announces record profits May 10, 2016 Play Emirati who created 2 successful companies Jan 02, 2016 13Images Gold bars that can be used as emergency payment Dec 26, 2012 8Images Fujairah’s new supertanker jetty Sep 26, 2016 10Images Top ten tallest buildings in the world Dec 30, 2009 10Images Apple unveils Nike+ smartwatch Oct 29, 2016 Currency Converter first-currency currencyAEDDinarRupee= first-currency currencyINRDinarRupee Most Popular on Gulf News Tiger attacks girl in Saudi Arabia Dubai: Get ready for National Day sale UAE announces public, private sector holidays Manager summoned for holding passport Look: Mohammad, son Zayed out for lunch Couple burnt charcoal to kill themselves Number 1 plate sold for Dh31m in Abu Dhabi Rain forecast in UAE over next few days Accidents slow down traffic in Dubai Close Recommended For You Prepare for the driverless-car revolutionPUBLISHED ON Nov 23, 2016 People would still find fake news ...PUBLISHED ON Nov 23, 2016 Wife confronts husband, lover in hospitalPUBLISHED ON Nov 23, 2016 Feedback Get The Paper Our Apps Mobile friendly version Our location Advanced Search Sitemap MY GULF NEWS GulfNews.com is the most widely read newspaper, and online site in English in the Middle East.

 Google's top education expert says we teach machines better than we teach our kids Chris Weller Aug. 16, 2016, 9:45 AM 1,997 facebook linkedin twitter email print SoftBank humanoid robot known as Pepper dressed as a waiter moves its hand at Pepper World 2016 Summer during SoftBank World 2016 conference in Tokyo, Japan, July 21, 2016 REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon Computers may be getting a better education than students, according to one expert at Google. Jonathan Rochelle, head of the product management team for Google's education outreach arm, called Google for Education, says the techniques we use to teach our machines are far more effective at making them smarter than the methods we use to teach living, breathing students. Whereas machines learn algorithms and systems for building knowledge, kids get facts and equations jammed down their throats, he says. "We're not teaching them how to learn," Rochelle tells Business Insider. Much of the science about learning suggests that Rochelle's criticism is well-founded. Cognitive science has shown that in order to grow into capable adults, kids shouldn't just learn when George Washington crossed the Delaware or how to compute the area under a curve. They also need to develop the skills that let them synthesize that raw information and draw conclusions when given a specific problem. As Rochelle explains, that's basically how computer algorithms work. IBM Watson is so smart because it continuously takes in new information and fits it into the frameworks it was given at birth. When it encounters a foreign query, it can make an educated guess based on all that prior knowledge. The good news for our kids is that teaching methods — like programming strategies — can change. Programming didn't always take the algorithmic approach, Rochelle says. Thirty years ago, the field of machine learning looked a lot like how pedagogy works today. Engineers gave their rudimentary machines explicit instructions. They told them what to know and provided few frameworks for them to make sense of new inputs on their own. But then developers got smarter about teaching their machines — they experienced "machine-learning learning," as Rochelle puts it. Educators could do well to adopt the same principles. In practice, that means helping kids understand why a particular math equation works and when it's applicable, rather than just teaching the formula. When students are learning that way, Rochell explains, "you don't have to feed them the actual answers. ... It's more, here's information that got us to a prior conclusion. Now we're going to teach you how to draw conclusions."

Hongkiat.com Main Menu Design / Dev Technology Inspiration Social Commerce All Deals Search Hongkiat for: Reveal Search Form Reveal Off-canvas Navigation How to Validate Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) Published by Thoriq Firdaus,in Coding In our last AMP tutorial, we have shown you how to adopt AMP (Accelerated Mobile Pages) to gain a significant speed boost as well as better exposure in Google’s mobile search result for your website in the mobile environment. Having seen AMP‘s potential, I assume you might have started or have plans to start making changes to your websites to comply with AMP. Carefully follow the guidelines on the Docs and compose your CSS to style the AMP pages to fit your visual appetite. Beginner’s Guide to Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) Beginner’s Guide to Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) Accelerated Mobile Pages is Google's initiative that intends to solve the biggest problem of the mobile web –…Read more Now, there is one last thing to do: validating those pages. AMP Validators There are several ways to validate your AMP pages: Add in the #development=1 trail at the end of the AMP page URL. The report will be projected in the Console tab under DevTools. Alternatively you can use the online AMP validator. You can also use the Chrome AMP extension. How To Customize Google Chrome DevTools Theme How To Customize Google Chrome DevTools Theme For most people, the current color scheme in DevTools probably looks fine but the white and gray combination…Read more These tools will produce a report listing errors or warnings within the pages. Based on this, you can choose what to fix. Pin it AMP error report in DevTools Console. AMP validation primarily governs the use of HTML elements, the s, and the style declarations. Make sure that these things in the page are all AMP-compliant, and that nothing that violates AMP guidelines are left in there. Otherwise, your AMP page will not appear anywhere. Data Structure AMP also requires the Schema data structure. This data is laid out within the head tag of the page in JSON format. It contains contextual informatiom of the page including the title, the publisher logo and name, the date it was published and modified, etc. <script type="application/ld+json">
{
  "@context": "http://schema.org",
  "@type": "NewsArticle",

</script> Depending on the purpose of the page, the data to include may vary: Articles, Reviews, Recipes, Videos, etc. You can refer to Google Data Types Documentation for details on data type. There is some data required which will produce errors if not supplied; a few other types of data are optional and will only produce warnings. These type of errors however will not appear in the aforementioned AMP validators. Instead, they will appear in the Google Structured Data Testing Tool as well as in your Google Webmasters account. Pin it AMP consumers or a client that supports AMP, such as Google Search and Twitter Moments, may use this set of data to present AMP content in their result page. Pin it AMP carousel in Google SERP So, aside from following AMP guidelines with their proprietary custom HTML elements, the required Schema data have to be in place as well. Overlooked Errors Most errors are noted in the Docs explicitly and can be easily picked up in a glimpse. A few errors however are contextualized with variables that we may fail to notice such as the “Invalid attribute value”, which says "The attribute '%1' in tag '%2' is set to the invalid value '%3'.". This error report does not mention or list precisely which value is invalid . But what I do know is that we cannot set the width and the height of <amp-img> element to 100% or auto. These attribute values have to be the exact size of the image to preserve the image ratio. Pin it This is just one example. There are a number of custom elements – amp-img, amp-iframe, and amp-ads – with their own sets of validation rules against the use of an attribute and its value. This could make validating AMP Page a daunting task, especially if we take hundreds or (perhaps) thousands of legacy content published years ago into account. Final Thought AMP is still in its early stage. It is in very active development with communal efforts from Google and the web development community. But AMP will certainly evolve. Similar to HTML5, there might be elements, attributes, and some practices that will deprecate in the future. So make sure that your AMP pages are constantly validated from time to time based on the latest changes to the guidelines. More Load More Posts © 2007‐2016 Hongkiat.com (HKDC). All Rights Reserved.

Beginning Tuesday, Google will provide a summary box detailing state voting laws at the top of the search results whenever a user appears to be looking for that information. The breakdown will focus on the rules particular to the state where the search request originates unless a user asks for another location. Google is introducing the how-to-vote instructions a month after it unveiled a similar feature that explains how to register to vote in states across the U.S. The search giant said its campaign is driven by rabid public interest in the presidential race between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. As of last week, it said, the volume of search requests tied to the election, the candidates and key campaign issues had more than quadrupled compared to a similar point in the 2012 presidential race. TURNOUT EFFECTS It’s difficult to predict whether Google’s efforts will have a major impact on how many people cast ballots, says Michael McDonald, a University of Florida political scientist who closely studies election turnout. That’s because Google will narrowly target its voting instructions to people who are actively seeking that information. Sample requests that will elicit a helping hand from Google include “what do I need to vote,” ”when can I vote,” ”what is the absentee ballot deadline” and “can I vote by mail.” The summary boxes won’t appear for broader requests pertaining to the election, such as “Clinton” or “Trump.” That means Google may primarily end up helping out “politically engaged” people who’d be likely to cast a November ballot even without prodding from the world’s most popular search engine. “It’s an open question on how large the positive effect will be,” McDonald said. ONLINE PRODDING Other online services have previously tried to encourage more people to vote. In the November 2010 midterm election, for instance, Facebook posted a “get out the vote” message in the news feeds of about 60 million people on its social network. A University of California at San Diego study of that Facebook effort estimated it boosted voter turnout by about 340,000 people. Google will also release its registration and voting guides to nonprofit groups and other organizations aiming to get more people to the polls this November. The company said it considers its voting tools to be a nonpartisan public service, although swings in voter turnout have swayed past elections. McDonald, though, says it is always difficult to predict which candidate in an election stands to gain the most from an increase in voter turnout. As an example, he suggests, Google’s effort could easily help increase the number of younger people more inclined to vote for Clinton — or put more ballots in the hands of less educated, disillusioned citizens backing Trump.

As great as the service can be, Allo and Duo duplicate its functionality and even add on to it with more features. Until now Google hasn’t said much regarding the service’s future except that Allo and Duo wouldn’t be replacing it. Today we’ve learned more about Google’s plan for the service through Google’s VP of communication products, Nick Fox. Talking to Engadget, Fox revealed that after the release of Allo and Duo, Hangouts would shift its focus to the enterprise user with Allo and Duo taking over the consumer market. Because Hangouts is built on a Google account, because it’s deeply integrated with Google apps, the Apps suite [things like Drive, Docs, etc.], Gmail, Calendar and so on, it’s seen much more success in the enterprise. It will increasingly focus on that kind of group collaboration enterprise productivity space. Google is likely taking this approach because while Hangouts ties itself to a Google account, Allo and Duo both use phone numbers. Fox further said that Google realized that it didn’t really make sense to have a single app to do everything. He says that with these two new apps Google wanted to create focused experiences that do what they are intended to do and do them very well. This, of course, makes sense. Most consumers today spend their time on mobile only, pretty much only on a single smartphone, so the desktop and tablet clients on Hangouts aren’t utilized by those users. Meanwhile, enterprise users would need access to desktop clients, access on multiple devices, and many of the other features that Hangouts offers. As Allo and Duo gain traction, they will likely replace Hangouts entirely for the average consumer, but we’ll just have to wait and see.

Otherwise, they may only display older content in search result pages. You need to be aware that search engines probably don’t explore your entire website, because of crawl budget limitations. Also, if your website publishes new content regularly (like e-commerce marketplaces, news publishing websites, classifieds websites, forums) your most important content may not be discovered fast enough, not in full – or neither. Here are some important questions you should ask yourself to make sure you are not missing key traffic opportunities on your new pages: How Much of Your New Content Does Google Explore? To get an answer, we need to do two things: Get the inventory of new pages, with a crawler set to explore the website periodically (weekly or daily for instance) to track changes, Find out which of these new pages are explored by search engines. Web server log files are the only source for this information: they record every single hit on the website, wherever it comes from – a user or a search engine robot. A report that combines both aspects sheds light on Google’s behavior on your new pages. Let’s take a look at the example of an e-commerce website. The first chart details the website as discovered by the website crawler, showing only new pages (those not found in the previous report, one week earlier). Only those in blue were explored by Google. The search engine’s behavior will vary depending on the type of page (product lists, product pages, etc.), so each type of page is shown in a separate bar. Does your website aim to generate significant traffic from mobile devices? Then, you may also be interested in finding out which bot explored your new pages (Google’s generic bot used for desktop search traffic or its mobile bot), as shown in the bottom chart. Do New Pages Start Generating Traffic Right Away? Among new pages explored by Google, some start generating traffic while others don’t. Which are bringing in traffic? Those that do – a subset of pages crawled by Google – are called active pages in the chart below (in green). If the website crawler has visibility over the date the page was added to the website, for instance by extracting the publication date from article pages on a publishing website, then you can get even more insight by looking at the delay between each step in the organic traffic conversion funnel: publication date vs. date of first crawl by Google vs. date of first visit generated from Google results. Does Your Website Structure Promote Your New Pages the Way They Deserve? Some of your new pages weren’t even crawled by Google. Why is that? Their depth in the website structure (how many clicks are necessary to reach them from the home page), and the number of internal links they receive influences search engine crawl heavily. Here is, for our previous example, the distribution of incoming links to new pages. The blue line indicates the number of links by percentile for the whole website (pages in the top percentile receive on average close to 10,000 links each, while those in the lower percentiles receive a single link on average). The distribution of new pages in the different percentiles is shown in yellow. If we look only at pages that were crawled by Google (top chart), and only at pages that were not crawled (bottom chart), the impact of internal linking is pretty obvious: most pages that receive a significant number of links are crawled, most of those with few incoming links are ignored. What About Content? Internal linking is about page accessibility to crawlers. Another potential reason for pages not being crawled may be poor content quality. If a certain type of page tends to have thin content or little unique content – which Google will know, based on pages of the same type crawled previously –  it does not provide an incentive to try to crawl more of these pages at every opportunity. Poor content quality may also be one of the reasons why some new pages are crawled by Google, but don’t generate traffic: they are not good enough to rank.

Duo is widely seen as part of Google’s business strategy to make apps compatible with a broad set of devices, providing iOS and Mac users alternatives to Apple apps. Google hopes to attract users through a simple and easy to use interface for Duo which enables calls to anyone on a user’s phone contact list without needing a separate account. Analysts said Google’s previous video calling and messaging app Hangouts had limited adoption because it required both users to have a Google account. The switch to using phone numbers rather than a Google account or Gmail address brings Duo in line with Facebook’s Messenger and WhatsApp, Skype and FaceTime, making it easier to video call friends, family and other people already stored on mobile phone contact lists. Google also claims to have built Duo to be fast and reliable even on slow networks by adjusting picture resolution automatically to ensure connections are maintained. Due is also designed to switch between Wi-Fi and cellular data automatically without dropping calls. Read more about Google Google claims it is notifying customers of the 4,000 state-sponsored cyber attacks a month amid security concerns about Pokémon Go, developed by Google spinoff Niantic. As Google faces a fine of around $3bn for anti-competitive practices in Europe, Russian authorities have ordered the internet giant to pay $6.8m for abusing its dominant position. Google Fiber plans to expand tests of wireless broadband to accelerate the roll-out of low-cost superfast internet across the US. “To make calls feel more like an invitation rather than an interruption, we created a feature in Duo called Knock Knock which lets you see live video of your caller before you answer, giving you a sense of what they’re up to and why they want to chat,” Google said in a blog post. Google is also hoping to win competitive advantage by emphasising the Duo has been built with attention to privacy and security, with Duo calls being encrypted end-to-end. Duo is aimed at the consumer market, which means it will not replace Hangouts, which will continue to be developed for enterprise users and become more integrated with Google Apps.

Google is reportedly working on a new OS, that moves the company away from its dependence on Linux Japanexperterna dot se flickr Tentatively called 'Fuchsia', the OS will power smart devices, including phones, TV, and home devices. The home devices bit is the clincher - Google is moving into futuristic home tech, Internet of Things terrain. The name was revealed on software repository Github :“Pink + Purple = = Fuchsia (a new Operating System)." Till date, Google has depended on Linux for ChromeOS and Android.  The name comes from the new software on which Fuchsia may be built - Magenta. Android Police report claims that Google may replace Android and Chrome OS. With Google already working to push Android apps to Chrome OS device, a unified approach seems like Google's long term strategy. facebook twitter reddit Comment Here ADVERTISEMENT Follow @indiatimes Next on Indiatimes Lifestyle: Google Launches Video Calling App 'Duo' To Take On Apple's Facetime And Skype Spotlight PARTNER 6 Ways Your Bridesmaid Can Help You Keep Calm On The Big Day PARTNER 7 Things That People Who Are Always Lost In Their Own Thoughts Will Relate To The 'Hum Paanch' Team Had An Epic Reunion & Their Pictures Will Definitely Make You Nostalgic!

New CyanogenMod 13 build could be the answer If your handset hasn't received the latest Android security patches from Google, it might be time to consider running the Android Marshmallow 6.0-based CyanogenMod, which does offer them. By Liam Tung | August 16, 2016 -- 13:00 GMT (06:00 PDT) | Topic: Security CyanogenMod developers say this release offers all Android security bulletins up to the most recent patch level. Image: CNET Cyanogen Inc may have reined in its ambitions to take control of Android from Google, but Cyanogen developers are still rolling out regular updates to CyanogenMod for dozens of Android handsets. Wileyfox unveils three Cyanogen OS-powered smartphones UK startup plans to hit the two-million handset milestone in the next 12 months. Read More The latest release is the CyanogenMod 13 snapshot, the most stable version of the firmware. It includes a number of new features, but the most notable are its security updates. Google has now been providing monthly Android security patches for Nexus devices for a year and has encouraged Android handset makers to do the same. But while Samsung and LG have adopted monthly patches for premium handsets, many handsets still don't receive them. CyanogenMod developers say this release incorporates all Android security bulletins that Google has released up to the most recent patch level of August 5, 2016. However, it appears CyanogenMod was not able to fully address the four Qualcomm driver bugs revealed by security firm Check Point last week, known as Quadrooter. "Of the four reported CVEs, we've been able to plug the ones that affected OSS code (ie the kernel), specifically CVE-2016-2059 and CVE-2016-5340. However, some of the reported vulnerabilities lie within OEM binary blobs, meaning we don't have source access to resolve them," CyanogenMod developers wrote. The developers believe these bugs will persist indefinitely as it is unlikely OEMs will release the code necessary to address them. As a result, the only action users can take is to be cautious about which apps they download. Android devices can be infected if an app with Quadrooter exploits is installed. After the Quadrooter bugs were revealed, Google said Android devices with the latest patch level of August 5, 2016, were protected against three of the four vulnerabilities. It plans on releasing a patch for CVE-2016-5340 in a future Android security bulletin. Also, Google said its Verify Apps security feature would help block apps that exploit these bugs. CyanogenMod developers have made available a more detailed list of feature updates for the latest snapshot build.

The apps can be seen as great alternatives to Apple’s iMessage and FaceTime, respectively, as they’ll also going to work on iPhone, not just Android. Meanwhile, Google finally released one of them, Duo, which is available for download right away from the App Store and the Google Play store. DON’T MISS: iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus compared in new high-quality 4K video Google describes Duo as a seamless way of initiating and enjoying video calls with friends and loved ones. All you have to do is tap on a contact’s phone number to start a video call. There’s no account setup necessary and no burdensome process to get started. However, you do need to let the person you want to video chat with that they also have to install the app on their devices. Google says that video calls will be “fast and reliable” on Duo and that they’ll “work well even on slower networks.” It all happens thanks to an automatic resolution throttling to keep the call going. The app can seamlessly switch between Wi-Fi and cellular without dropping your call, which is one other handy feature to consider. One of the cool features of Duo is called Knock Knock that lets you see video from the caller before answering, which might come in handy in case you want to avoid certain calls. As for security, all Duo calls are end-to-end encrypted, Google says. Will Duo be a FaceTime killer? It’s likely that iPhone fans who are already using Apple’s video call service will not ditch it for Duo anytime soon. But they should still install it as this app will let them video chat with Android users as well – download links are available at the source links below.

Skype, truly the pioneer in video calling, has become a household name for us. Especially for those who have family staying abroad. A number of others came with their own rendition of what an ideal video calling app should be like. Apple came up with Facetime that allowed Apple users connect with each other through video via WiFi or cellular networks. Google too, came out with Hangout but they were still lacking a simple, mobile-only video messaging app until now. Welcome, Duo.  Google What is it? To put it in the simplest way possible, Google Duo is a 1-to-1 video calling app only available for Android and iOS. Keeping the UI (user interface) as clean as possible, Google takes pride in claiming that Duo takes the complexity out of video calling, keeping it as basic as possible.  Google How does it work? Launching today and being rolled out in app stores worldwide over the next few day, Duo is pretty basic to set-up and use. When a user signs up, the app checks your phone number from the SIM and sends you confirmation text. That's it. Done. You would now be able to reach everyone on your phone's contact list. No separate account required, no remembering password nonsense either. Its simple interface might be exactly what attracts people. In fact, the app itself is a very simple and basic one that's meant to carry out one function, and do it well. You cannot use it for anything apart from your phone. You cannot make conference calls, or make funny Snapchat like faces.  Google It also claims to solve a major issue we face regularly. No matter how advanced a video app is, one problem that's been constant, even in the most sophisticated of apps, is the issue of choppy video and call drops. The apps aren't to be blamed here. Our local internet and cellular connections are generally so bad that call drops and lags are something we have learnt to live with over the years and this is exactly what Duo promises to tackle. According to Google, Duo is built to be fast and reliable which makes sure the video works well even on slower networks like Indias. Even when the network connection is patchy, Duo reduces call resolution making sure the call goes on smoothly. It also switches from your cellular to WiFi seamlessly without automatically dropping your call. Claims that can be verified in India only after its official launch.  Google Knock Knock Knock Knock is a standout feature of the app. In order to make video calls less of an intrusion and more of an invitation, Knock Knock lets Duo users see a live video of the caller even before you answer their call. Just to give you a sense of what they are up to or why they are calling. I can totally see this becoming a source of entertainment in the near future, however.  As the world talks about personal information being encroached on, Duo has taken the WhatsApp route as far as privacy and security are concerned. All calls exchanged on Duo are meant to be end-to-end encrypted. 1.3k facebook twitter reddit Comment Here ADVERTISEMENT Follow @indiatimes Next on Indiatimes Lifestyle: Audi Cars Will Soon Come With A New Feature, Will Be Able To Communicate With Traffic Signals Spotlight PARTNER 6 Ways Your Bridesmaid Can Help You Keep Calm On The Big Day PARTNER 7 Things That People Who Are Always Lost In Their Own Thoughts Will Relate To The 'Hum Paanch' Team Had An Epic Reunion & Their Pictures Will Definitely Make You Nostalgic!

And if you wondering what happens to Google Hangouts after Allo and Duo chat apps, the company says that it will aim Hangouts at business customers. But before you get alarmed, Google Hangouts will also continue to exist alongside for general users. According to a report from Engadget, Google's vice president of communication products, Nick Fox said that since Hangouts is more deeply integrated with users' Google accounts and with services like Drive, Docs, Sheets and more, it would make more success in the enterprise section. Google is working on a new operating system, Fuchsia The OS is based on Magenta, which is a “medium-sized microkernel” that itself is based on a project called as LittleKernel. "Because Hangouts is built on a Google account, because it's deeply integrated with Google apps, the Apps suite [things like Drive, Docs, etc.], Gmail, Calendar and so on, it's seen much more success in the enterprise," said Fox. "It will increasingly focus on that kind of group collaboration enterprise productivity space," he said. He even added that the search giant believes that keeping one single app for everything is not a good idea. "We've historically tried to do a lot in a single app, but the reality is that [video and text] are pretty different types of communication," he said. "We see them differently, and we think we'll be able to build the best experiences by building focused experiences that do what they're intended to do really, really well," added Fox. Google's video-calling app Duo: All you need to know Announced at its I/O developer conference earlier this year, Google has finally made its video calling app – Duo, available to the general public. The app boasts features like end-to-end encryption and claims to deliver a great user experience. Duo is set to take on the likes of WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp. Almost two months after unveiling its one-to-one video calling app Duo at I/O conference, the search giant has finally started rolling it out to Android and iOS users across the world. The app is set to take on its competitors from Microsoft, Facebook and Apple such as Skype, Messenger and FaceTime. Allo is a standard chatting app, which works a lot like WhatsApp and is expected to arrive soon.

The error will show in the search result snippet and be a hyperlink to the help documentation on how to fix the error. Google is aggressively pushing AMP adoption for webmasters, recently announcing they are expanding AMP into the core mobile search results. Jon Henshaw posted this screen shot of the AMP error notification he saw in the desktop search results: Google also offers site owners warnings if their site is not mobile-friendly, so this is an obvious extension of that. The AMP warnings to site owners read “Your page has AMP implementation errors.” Google has confirmed this is not a test.

Aug 16th 2016, 1:54 PM 11,695 Views 13 Comments Share3 Tweet Email1 Image: Google/YouTube GOOGLE’S ANSWER TO popular video chat apps like Apple FaceTime and Skype has started rolling out today. Duo was originally announced back in May, alongside new chat app Allo, as a way to replace the old Hangouts app, the standard Google app for messaging. Available for both iOS and Android, it’s Google’s attempt to not only simplify its messaging apps for users but signal a new start for its messaging service. The app started rolling out today, and will be available worldwide over the next few days, but it’s dealing with a tough market, and a tougher audience to win over. Its problems can be boiled down into three main points. Video (http://www.youtube.com/watch=CIeMysX76pM&t=) Source: Google/YouTube It makes Google’s messaging range more confusing Google already has a number of chat apps and services including Hangouts, Messenger (for SMS), Spaces (for groups), Gchat, and Google Voice (a US service which makes calls through Gmail). Adding Allo and Duo makes things more confusing. Not to mention the general messaging apps the likes of Samsung and Huawei include on their own phones. Despite being around for three years now, Hangouts has been all but forgotten by Google and releasing Messenger wasn’t exactly a vote of confidence for it. Either way, Google would do well to phase out Hangouts or if rumours are correct, turn it into an app for businesses. Hangouts Live has already been changed into YouTube Live so that process may well be underway. Duo’s best feature is limited to one platform One of the major features included – but only available for Android users – is called Knock Knock. When someone calls you, you will see them (or wherever their camera is pointed) before you accept and turn on your own camera. The idea is you can use this moment to do something like make faces, show off something, or wave at the receiver. It’s clear that this is the feature Google expects to pull people in – it’s front and centre of its main promo video. Source: Google Except on iOS, it only comes up as a general call icon. The reason for this is because Apple doesn’t allow third-party apps to use the lock screen for anything other than notifications. That’s a blow to it as it’s one of the few unique features Duo can offer. The other two things Google says makes Duo unique is a simple interface – you only need a phone number to sign up and you can make calls with one tap – and fast and reliable calls, with quality adjusting if a connection or reception quality dips. There’s nothing wrong with either, but it’s unlikely people will become regular users based on simplicity. Concept is usually better than execution – just look at Snapchat and how popular it is despite its interface being unconventional – and that’s difficult to nail. As for video call quality, it might not be as good as Google made it out to be. Allo and Duo being announced at Google I/O back in May. Source: AP Photo/Eric Risberg It’s entering a very crowded market Up against Duo are a couple of apps that have been around for years. Skype and Apple Facetime are two of the most popular examples out there and those aren’t apps that are used too often for video calls. Each one includes voice-only calls which offers some variation, but Duo doesn’t have this. Since Google focused on simplicity – keeping the focus on doing one thing well – it means Duo will find it harder to gain traction. Everyone texts and makes calls but how often do you make video calls? If both Duo and Allo become the standard messaging apps for Android – similar to how iMessage and FaceTime are the standards for iOS – then it will have a good chance of gaining traction. Yet there might not be enough here for people to ditch FaceTime or Skype, no matter how much people may criticise them. If it arrived two or three years ago, Duo might have been able to make a dent in the market, but people’s habits are difficult to change. And arriving late to the game certainly won’t help it.

A one-to-one video calling app “for everyone,” Duo allows iPhone users to call their Android-toting friends, and vice versa. After signing up with your mobile phone number, you can place video calls to contacts who also have Duo installed on their device. According to Google, Duo for Android and iOS began rolling out today and will be live worldwide in the next few days. Knock Knock Duo includes a feature, called Knock Knock, which lets you see live video of your caller before you answer, giving you a sense of what they’re up to and why they want to chat. Once the call is accepted, the video continues uninterrupted. Google claims Knock Knock helps make the video calling experience “more spontaneous and welcoming, helping you connect with the person before you even pick up.” The company, however, did not specify whether Knock Knock is available on iOS and in which form given iOS does not permit video to be shown before the user unlocks the handset and answers the call. Duo’s minimalist user interface strives to take the complexity out of video calling and the underlying technology was designed to connect video calls quickly and work well even on slower networks by adjusting quality to changing network conditions. When bandwidth is limited, Duo will “gracefully reduce the resolution” and/or switch between Wi-Fi and cellular data automatically, without dropping the call. “We built Duo with an emphasis on privacy and security, and all Duo calls are end-to-end encrypted,” says the company. As mentioned, no separate account is required to use Duo—all you need to sign up is your mobile phone number. Grab Duo for free from the App Store.

Google photo’s unlimited backup has no match. nirmitlamed Google does already has a lot of apps but i wouldn’t be so sure about those new apps that will make an impact on the rest of the messaging apps. Google due has a unique feature but not powerful enough to make people abandon their other apps. The same about Google Allo. Whatsapp and other Chinese messaging apps have to many users and more usable features than Google allo has. Not to forget the messaging apps can be updated to support the same Allo features if only the company wants to. Rowan09 Google photos has no match? Flickr gives you backups as well and more popular, there are tons of other and better options. None of Googles apps besides maps and YouTube is a huge success if you ask me. Hangouts failed, Google + failed, Google voice failed, drive is like every other services, etc. Samsung users has their own built in video calling service. Abhinav Chaudhary I had Flickr in my mind while typing but how almost everyone uses gmail as email service it’s no surprise Google photos will gain popularity at a fast pace, of course I may be wrong but after using google photos I’m in love with that app. I never worry about backing my photos no more like I used to every week a year ago. And the fact Google being the largest search engine it’s artificial intelligence algorithms will develop faster than any other algorithm. Rowan09 I tried it but couldn’t get it to upload some videos I had so I stopped using it, plus the fact Google can use your photos is a no go for me. Gmail offers nothing over any other popular mail service, I use it along with live and live works more consistent than gmail. Abhinav Chaudhary If you are worried about your online privacy then I must say nothing is private online. Everything can be hacked. And in this age with Facebook, Google and tons of other clouds nothing is safe unless you go old school and backup your data in a hard drive and put it in a bio metric safe buried 10 feet under ground on some remote location. Did you ever thought how almost your entire life is online from your bank accounts to that check in at some movie, if a hacker decides to specifically target a person that person is so fuked. I bet world war 3 will be a digital one. Rowan09 I use my own WD cloud storage and it’s 2 TB which is perfect for me. I also don’t have anything crazy on the cloud. Blip dude It’s not even a privacy concern, but man cloud storage just outright sucks. It’s always either the data or just the service itself. Also, by having on a solid flash drive it’s already there. I feel bad for the kids on campus whenever servers go down and can’t access their assignments because apparently flash drives are now obsolete (hahaha), yet complain because they didn’t have a plan B to access their stuff. I tried Google Photos, and yes I enjoyed it but it still came down to crappy connections and waiting hours to restore my stuff back so just like all other cloud storages, I had to pass. Mike I’m a college student and servers rarely go down.. plus when you are working with a big company like google the chances of servers going down is close to none. The benefit of have cloud backup is that if you have a 2tb hard drive and if your house burns down, HD breaks, or etc. all your pictures will still be backed up. @Rowan09 Also for the people that are so worried about google using their pictures are straight up stupid… Think about this… There’s millions of people in the world that use Google photos. Just on android there’s 500 million downloads… Now pretend each person has 10 pictures so the number of pictures would be 5 billion… So the chances that your picture would be picked is 10/5,000,000,000. Just I only have over 500 pictures backed up. jalexcarter no…Amazon’s unlimited everything backup has no match. ravinigga True also the have a lot of power on our private info Syed Google did mention this but: Incoming calls will not automatically show the Knock Knock preview on iOS. iOS users will not receive a Knock Knock video preview from incoming calls unless Duo is already open. Outgoing calls will show a video preview to Android contacts only. All users can disable Knock Knock at any time. Abhinav Chaudhary This app is not available in India and I really want to try it. And yes I do have a state iTunes account but switching deletes all your Apple Music. racerhomie2 dont worry ,they said they will launch it worldwide within a few days Kiran Bhavikeri It is available in India…look up Google Duo in App Store. oo.p previewing the video before picking up the call is a terrible idea Bill I disagree and liken it to screening a call on an answering machine. If you don’t know what I mean- I’m referring to a land line phone with a physical answering machine. When someone would call and you let the machine pick up, the caller would start to leave a message. If it was someone you didn’t want to talk to you let them leave the message. If you did want to talk to them you picked the phone up and did so. This was before caller ID was a thing, mind you. At any rate, I think knock knock is a novel idea. Blip dude I wouldn’t call it a bad idea, but I can see scenarios where it could go terrible. John Smith “Unable to register”. Their servers are overloaded and in the error message they blame my connection. Robert Martin same here. diggitydang Not available in Canada yet… 🙁 Abdullah Safdar I want a Huawei Nexus 6p…. Sebastián Junca  It looks nice, bit it drains your battery more than facetime or even Skype.

Resend activation e-mail Gear & Gadgets / Product News & Reviews Google launches Duo, a barebones video calling app Is a fancy incoming call screen enough to make people switch? by Ron Amadeo - Aug 16, 2016 12:38 pm UTC Login to bookmark At Google I/O 2016, Google announced two new and separate communication apps: Allo, a new instant messenger app, and Duo a video calling app. Today Google announced Duo is finally rolling out to the masses on Android and iOS. Google Duo is a video calling app and just a video calling app—it does one-to-one video calls and nothing else. It's also only available for mobile phones—there are no Web, Chrome, or desktop clients. It doesn't even require a Google Account—Google says that "all you need is your phone number and you’ll be able to reach people in your phone’s contacts list." Duo has two features. The first is that the video calling is claimed to be "fast and reliable" even with limited bandwidth. It can switch between Wi-Fi and cellular data without dropping the call and can "gracefully degrade" the video when bandwidth gets low. The other feature is called "Knock Knock," which shows live video from your contact on the incoming call screen before you even answer the call. Knock Knock doesn't work on iOS right now. On the security side of things, Google notes that "all Duo calls are end-to-end encrypted." What about the billion+ users of Hangouts? Google's other video calling app (and instant messaging app), Google Hangouts, isn't going away. With the advent of Duo and Allo, Google has maintained that Hangouts will be transitioning to an "enterprise" product. Google hasn't talked about what will happen to the existing users of Google Hangouts, however. When Google made the transition from Google Talk to Google Hangouts, Hangouts was an in-place upgrade to the Google Talk Android client. Just look at the URL of Google Hangouts on the Play Store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.talk. Hangouts took over the Google Talk package name—"com.google.android.talk"—so everyone that was on Google Talk got automatically upgraded to Hangouts. Google Talk/Hangouts has been Google's default instant messenger since Android 1.5—that's six years of user accumulation by being a default app. According to the Google Play Store, Hangouts has over a billion users. Allo and Duo have their own package names, which means Hangouts users won't be upgraded to them, and Google has yet to reveal a plan to upgrade the billion+ users of Hangouts. It also hasn't said whether Allo and Duo will become default apps on Android. The Duo/Allo plan didn't make a ton of sense when it was announced, and it doesn't make a ton of sense now. Hangouts works on Android, iOS, Chrome OS, the Web, and through Chrome extensions, on Windows, macOS, and Linux. It supports one-to-one video calling and group video calling, along with video overlays and effects. Hangouts supports instant messaging and SMS and integrates with Google Voice and Project Fi. Hangouts is generally neglected and mismanaged, but pushing users away from Hangouts and toward a less fully featured product doesn't feel like a good answer. Forget about the rest of the world, Google has a lot of work to do if it even wants to win its own users over. The rollout for Duo starts today, and it will be available worldwide "in the next few days." Expand full story Reader comments You must login or create an account to comment.

In recent years, the Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning (MSIP) has called for Google, handset manufacturers and mobile carriers to stop non-essential apps from coming bundled with phones as pre-installed apps, as the regulator identified the move as a monopolistic scheme hurting users' rights. As part of its hard-line policy, the media watchdog said in May that it plans to revise a law to allow Android users to delete Google's non-removable, pre-installed apps. The move earned favorable market responses, as customers here have voiced complaints over some non-removable preinstalled apps that gobble up a fair amount of storage for their handsets. But the government ignited another controversy last week over its "Government 3.0" application recommended for installation in the Galaxy Note 7. The app is not non-removable, nor is it pre-installed for Samsung's new flagship handset. Critics, however, voiced concerns over why the government made the decision to promote policy by introducing its app at a time when it is taking a hard-line stance on unnecessary apps from Google and Android platform business operators. The Government 3.0 project is a mainstream policy initiated by President Park Geun-hye, pushing for more active data sharing among relevant state-run bodies to provide more convenient online and mobile services for the public. "The government is making fun of the public by introducing the app while setting up Galaxy Note 7," the Green Consumer Network, a local civic group, said in a statement, Tuesday. "Users can download tens of hundreds of government apps by going to mobile app markets, but the apps are unpopular as they are unnecessary for users' lives," it added. The civic group expressed regret that the government violated the gist of its own policy, and called for regulators ― including the MSIP and the Korea Communications Commission (KCC) ― to stop hurting users' freedom to choose apps. Over the controversy, Samsung Electronics stressed last week that the Government 3.0 app was "not pre-installed" and users can choose whether to download it or not. Samsung Electronics Mobile Communications President Koh Dong-jin said in a Galaxy Note 7 launch event here: "Customers can decide whether to download it or not." He stressed that the Government 3.0 app is not a pre-installed app, and the company is only introducing the app. "Users can make their own choices over installing the app while setting up the Galaxy Note 7," he said. mhlee@ktimes.com   'Romantic Doctor' tops 20 percent view...
