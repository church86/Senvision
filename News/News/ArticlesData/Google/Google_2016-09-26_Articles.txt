With the router, Google will compete with devices which are rented or sold by platform operators such as cablers, telco’s and others. Chromecast Ultra will, which Android Police is all but certain is the name of Google’s upcoming 4K version of Chromecast, will retail at $69.

Rumours suggest a new VR headset and upgraded 4K Chromecast are in the offing as well as a device for your smart home which will be something like the Amazon Echo. Frankly it's kind of nuts they don't have one of those out already. But the one they're teasing most is definitely their latest smartphone upgrade. We're hearing that the 'Nexus' name is being dropped in favour of calling it the Google Pixel, which brings it into line with their premium laptop range. Now, the Venture Beat folks have a very high quality look at a render of the new phone. It looks like a smartphone, and a fairly basic design at that. The word is there'll be a headphone jack (!) at the top and a USB-C port on the bottom, while Google and manufacturers HTC have opted to place their fingerprint scanner on the rear. We're not mad about that positioning as it's impossible to unlock with a single touch while lying on a flat surface. Leaked specs suggest a 5 inch screen, 4 gigs of RAM and a 12 MP rear camera. So far it doesn't sound like there's anything here to set it apart from the crowd, which makes it all the more alarming when we hear that this will be Google's most expensive phone when it launches. And that the larger Pixel XL will be even pricier still. Hopefully Google has some surprises in store at their October 4th event.

By Stephanie Ritenbaugh / Pittsburgh Post-Gazette Google has launched its Express online shopping service in Pennsylvania as the search engine giant continues to expand the program across the country — joining rivals like online retailer Amazon in the push to get goods into the hands of online shoppers more quickly. Google Express aims to connect customers with fast delivery from big name retailers like Whole Foods, Costco, PetSmart and Sur la Table. The idea is to make it “easy for shoppers to get the things they need in one convenient place, from multiple stores,” the Mountain View, Calif.-based company said. Deliveries can be overnight or two-day shipments. In addition to Pennsylvania, Google is adding the service throughout the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic, estimating that about 70 million more people will now be able to use Express — a calculation based on population and ZIP codes. “About 75 percent of the U.S. population will have access” after Wednesday’s roll out, said Brian Elliott, general manager of Google Express. “We expect to bring it to the rest of the continental U.S. in a couple of months.” Google has not disclosed the number of users of its express service. According to comScore, a Virginia-based firm that measures media audiences and consumers, Google Express had about 1 million unique visitors in the U.S. as of August. Google sites have about 240.7 million unique visitors overall, comScore data. Mr. Elliot said bringing the service to the Pittsburgh region is personally exciting because a team in Google’s Bakery Square office has been part of developing the project for years. “It’s about time we bring it to them,” he said. Google first launched its delivery service in 2013, putting it in competition with Amazon Prime and Prime Now, the Seattle-based online marketplace’s speedy delivery service. Amazon Prime offers two-day shipping, along with access to movie and TV streaming for $10.99/​month or $99 for the year. Prime Now offers members same-day deliveries in select metro areas from grocery and home stores and restaurants, in addition to what is offered at Amazon.com. For Google Express, membership costs $95 the year or, for those who want to pay as they go, $4.99 per order. “They have a long hill to climb in this part of the sector,” said Neil Begley, a senior vice president for Moody’s Investor Services’ telecommunications/​media team. “That said, Google is hardly a Johnny-come-lately company. They’re extremely well recognized and have integrated their services to mobile and desktop, and their pricing is competitive with Amazon. However, Amazon has added benefits with its membership with movies, TV, and books.” As Google evaluates how it will claim market share in the delivery space, it has shelved plans for a similar service that would deliver fresh groceries, a program that it experimented with on the West Coast in February. “We’ve been testing a lot of types of services,” Mr. Elliot said. “It worked well, but we can’t really scale that to the entire United States. “What we’re trying to accomplish is to create a platform that will be available to everybody,” he said. “That’s hard to do with refrigerated and frozen goods, for a lot of reasons, including the packaging and the service being too expensive for some customers.” So far, Google Express-affiliated merchants include Costco, Kohl's, L'Occitane, PetSmart, Stop & Shop, Giant, Sur la Table, Ulta Beauty, Payless, Adorama, Road Runner, Vitamin Shoppe and Whole Foods. The company plans to add more merchants, Mr. Elliot said, and make the service available to smaller retailers and independent merchants over time.

The search company had started bringing Wi-Fi to railway stations in India last year in partnership with RailTel and Indian Railways; expanding that rollout to cafes, shopping centres and other public places appears to mark the second stage of Google Station. The current rollout covers 53 railway stations across India with Google citing ambitions to scale that number up. “The goal is to give people many hot spots within a few minutes walk from their home, university, or workplace, unified by a simple login process that works across all of them,” said Caesar Sengupta, Vice-President of the Next Billion Users programme at Google. India’s Internet Despite being a country with one of the largest population in the world, India’s rapid growth over the past few decades has led to a divide between wealthy middle-class with Internet access and poorer people who have a poor or no Internet access. Projects like Google Station and Facebook Internet.org, which aims to provide free Internet connectivity in India and other regions where a connection is not widely available, look to fill in the divide between those who have Internet access and those who do not. It could be argued that Google and Facebook’s seemingly philanthropic endeavours are perhaps means of getting more people to use their services in return for free Internet services. However, the Internet is pretty much the great enabling tool of our generation, giving people a voice, status and access to the wider world, be that through social platforms or access to online marketplaces; either way it offers opportunities that narrow the gap between the rich and poor. With Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg committed to Internet.org and its ambitions to bring wireless broadband to Africa via satellites, we can expect access to the Internet on a global scale to expand significantly in the near-future.

PERSONAL TECH BIZ TECH FUTURE TECH SCIENCE LIFE TECH TV Advertisement hot newsNES Classic Edition: Nintendo Will Restock for the Holiday Season, Where to Buy it Follow Us Home PERSONAL TECH Software & Apps Google Announces 'YouTube Go' App for Offline Video Streaming and Sharing By Angel Soleil, | September 27, 2016 Google has launched its "YouTube Go" app in India. "YouTube Go" is a new app launched by Google in Delhi which enables mobile users to stream videos in areas with limited or no connectivity at all. The app is part of the "Next Billion" program which aims to connect India's next billion people to the internet. Like Us on Facebook Google CEO Sundar Pichai wrote in The Economic Daily that "[in] an increasingly mobile-first world, India gives us early insights into the future of the Internet." India is one of the countries that suffer from data constraints due to slow or limited internet connectivity, and "YouTube Go" is designed to address the issue, at least in terms of video streaming. By default, streaming a video online could be near to impossible with a network as slow as 2G, but Google promises that the features offered by the app can reach devices even if it seems to be off-limits. First of all, "YouTube Go" offers users with video recommendations on the home screen based on what is trending and popular. A video preview is then loaded with a choice to select the video resolution and identify the file size to help users decide if they would opt to watch the video or download save it for offline viewing. The app also allows video sharing via Bluetooth, to save users the hassle of needing the internet. Users in India can now sign up to test "YouTube Go," but Google has not made a formal announcement about when the app will be rolled out, or if it plans to make it accessible across the globe.

Looking at the issues people face and the lengths people go to in order to view videos on YouTube, international tech giant, Google has come up with Youtube Go, inspired by India. Google will be launching Youtube Go next year in India. Google had earlier launch YouTube Offline in the country that was very popular among the users. For the new product, YouTube Go, Google has mainly worked on four important aspects connectivity, cost, relatable and social. Here’s how the product works and why it makes sense for India. In terms of connectivity, it is designed to work in areas with low or no connectivity. Users can choose whether they want to view the videos on Youtube Go in low and standard resolution. With the new product that is designed for India, users can also save videos for later on YouTube Go and share the downloaded videos with just one click. In order to make the product reach all across the country, Google will also make YouTube Go available in 10 different Indic languages. The page is going to be a lot simpler with just 10 videos on the home page. YouTubers can go on YoutubeGo.com/signup and experience the product. YouTube Go is inspired by India but it will be made available across many markets for Google. The product does touch on many key issues YouTube users face in India starting from poor connectivity to high data cost to language barriers.

Photo: Google Google is launching a new YouTube Go app that will finally allow users to download videos for offline playback. You’ll be able to choose the quality of the video you save, and the app will tell you exactly how much storage space is required for each clip. Google has long been fighting against YouTube video downloads for obvious reasons, and it comes down hard on third-party apps and tools that provide this option. However, the company recognizes that there’s a genuine need for it in places. YouTube Go is designed for those who live in areas where data coverage is limited. It gives users the option to download videos they know they’re going to want to watch later, and to share videos to friends’ devices locally without using any data.   YouTube Go builds upon the Smart Offline service that Google launched in India back in June. This downloads the latest videos from your favorite channels automatically overnight when your device is connected to Wi-Fi, allowing you to enjoy them throughout the day while offline. “YouTube Go is a brand new app to help the next generation of users share and enjoy videos,” said YouTube product management VP Johanna Wright. “YouTube Go was designed and built from the ground up with insights from India, in order to bring the power of video to mobile users in a way that is more conscious of their data and connectivity, while still being locally relevant and social.” The new app will be tested in India first before a wider rollout. Users can sign up to test the app now, but there’s currently no word on when it will be available in other countries.

Featured Story: How to Root Android: Our Always-Updated Rooting Guide for Any Phone or Tablet Android Gadget Hacks: Unchaining Android to enable tomorrow's features today — WonderHowTo Rumor Roundup: Andromeda, Pixel & More Coming at Google's Oct. 4 Announcement Carib Guerra last month Rumor Roundup: Andromeda, Pixel & More Coming at Google's Oct. 4 Announcement Are we about to witness the future of Android OS? Of Google? Of the entire smartphone ecosystem?! Google has just turned 18 today (right?), Android just had its 8th birthday, and the rumor mill is firing on all cylinders in the lead-up to the October 4 launch event where they'll announce their latest hardware and software products. As it goes with all rumors, nothing is certain and everything is subject to change. However, there are a few big things we strongly suspect will be announced. Pixel & Pixel XL It's practically guaranteed that Google is launching two premium smartphones on the 4th of October. If you took the massive outdoor ads, the teaser site, the minimalist video spot, and the sculpture in Brooklyn and shook them all together in a figurative Magic 8 Ball, all signs would point to yes. It's expected that the new devices will drop the Nexus moniker and will be branded as the Pixel and Pixel XL, despite being manufactured by HTC under the codenames Sailfish and Marlin, respectively. The Google Pixel (left) and Pixel XL (right). Images via VentureBeat As far as specs go, we aren't holding our breath for a revolution. Even if they're powered by the new Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 instead of the Snapdragon 820 that Samsung, LG, et al. have used this year, the performance boost will only be around 10 percent. And while that's not likely to blow your mind, it's enough to put Google's debut handsets solidly ahead of the pack in the US—at least for a while. Then again, a 10% bump over a chip that was designed as a gateway to the next generation of immersive experiences would mean that the Pixel and Pixel XL could be the first phones on the market that are truly "Daydream-ready"—a term that Google revealed (but didn't much elaborate on) to the world back in May. Which brings us to… Daydream First announced at Google's I/O 2016 in May, Daydream is Google's followup to Cardboard, the portable virtual reality headset made out of... you guessed it. Like Cardboard and the Samsung Gear VR, but quite unlike high-end VR headsets like Oculus Rift and HTC Vive, Daydream won't require a fully loaded PC. Users will simply slot their "Daydream-ready" phones into a headset and the whole virtual experience is handled by the device. Google Daydream VR. Image via Google By building the Daydream headset and limiting compatibility to devices certified as Daydream-ready, Google will be able to control every aspect of the mobile VR experience on Android. Additionally, Google has stated that only developers enrolled in their Daydream Access Program (DAP) will be allowed to publish apps for the new platform, at least until 2017. Don't Miss: Google's Daydream SDK Is Available Now—Here's How to Try It Out All things considered, with Google's power behind it and a suite of awesome applications, Daydream could be the tipping point for mobile VR into the mainstream. That's a big deal for all of us. An Unnamed Wi-Fi Router Another rumor, surfaced by Android Police, and now corroborated by Droid Life, is that Google is planning to unveil a new Wi-Fi router. The new device, known for now only as Google Wi-Fi, is expected to go beyond last year's OnHub router—far beyond. It seems that users will be able to maximize the reach of their wireless networks by installing additional modules that will extend the reach of the base router, forming a "mesh network" around their home. And speaking of that… Home Don't Miss: Google's New Home Assistant Is an Amazon Echo Killer Google Home is positioned to be a competitor to the Amazon Echo, bringing Google's voice assistant... home... to assist you. On October 4, Google will likely announce availability of the device as well as pricing, which is expected to undercut the Echo by around $50. While Amazon's virtual assistant has proved a runaway success, the suggestions and recommendations game is decidedly Google's forte. It will be an interesting battle, to be sure. According to The Information (subscription), Google Home is essentially just "a dressed-up version of Chromecast." Of course, it's also true that a nice outfit can make all the difference. Google Home. Image via Google Chromecast Ultra Fancy clothes or no, the Chromecast is already a slam dunk product for Google. Not much to report here. Android Police claims that the "Ultra" stands for 4K, which is great for early adopters of the ultra HD display technology, but won't mean much for most of us. With a generous bump in resolution comes a significant bump in price. The Chromecast Ultra is expected to be available alongside the standard $35 Chromecast at a price of $69. Image by Evan Blass/VentureBeat Andromeda What the heck is Andromeda? Much like the spiral galaxy itself, speculations are swirling. So far, it's assumed that Android + Chrome = Andromeda, a hybrid operating system possibly intended to power a whole suite of devices. What started as a vague murmur that Google might tease Andromeda at the October 4 event reached a fever pitch on September 24 when Hiroshi Lockheimer, Senior VP of Android, Google Play, and Chrome, tweeted: We announced the 1st version of Android 8 years ago today. I have a feeling 8 years from now we'll be talking about Oct 4, 2016. — Hiroshi Lockheime (Twitter) Image by Adam Evans/Flickr As The Wall Street Journal reported in October of 2015, Andromeda could be the culmination of years of work by Google engineers to merge the Android and Chrome OS into one. This would have obvious advantages over the current state of things. For one, Google would finally have a real contender in the PC market. This would give Android (or whatever it would be called) users a cohesive experience such as they've only leered at through the plate glass windows of Apple's walled garden. Whether "Andromeda" will be a wholly new OS or simply an extension of either Android and Chrome, along with the dissipation of the other, remains to be seen. Honestly, we don't even know if this will come up at Google's event. Then again, yet another report from Android Police has presented specs for a fairly impressive sounding laptop codenamed "Bison," or "Pixel 3," purported to be the first device running the hybrid Android/Chrome OS. So it's possible that Andromeda really is on the horizon, and not instead light years away. Nexus 7 While Google is rebranding their Nexus phones Pixel, word is that they will be keeping the Nexus name for the upcoming rumored Android tablet. Though, it's entirely possible it will end up being a Pixel. We think it could go either way. Names aside, this is great news for all of you forgotten about Nexus 7 users, since the tablet is suspected to sport a 7-inch display. Evan Blass said it will be made by Huawei—with twice as much RAM as the last Nexus 7. And 9to5Google thinks it might even be running Andromeda out of the box (at least, for developers). What Do You Think Is Coming? Fishing for facts amid internet rumors is never easy, especially when faced with the furor surrounding announcements from companies like Google. All the information here is compiled based on our best judgement and absolutely subject to change. Still, it's fun to wonder, isn't it? What do you think Google is scheming up on October 4 this year?

Google is planning a major event for 4 October, when it is expected to launch two new flagship Pixel-branded phones and other hotly-anticpated hardware like the Google Home voice-activated speaker and 4K-capable Chromecast Ultra. So, naturally, there has been no shortage to leaks and rumours approaching launch day, with the latest example yet being a clear look at the Google Pixel XL, thanks to an image from VentureBeat. This year, Google looks to be dumping the Nexus programme for smartphones and pushing Pixel devices instead. There are said to be two Pixel handsets, the larger of which, pictured here, offers a 5.5-inch QHD display. As you can see from the leak, the XL simply looks like a larger version of the Pixel, which Venture Beat also published a leaked image of on Tuesday. The two devices have the same icons and launcher. They also have the same navigation buttons, but the Pixel XL obviously has its own gradient wallpaper. These leaked images - the most crisp yet - appear to corroborate previous rumours and leaks, and their design reflects recent HTC handsets too, in the shape of the speaker and the front sensor.

Now thanks to a new post on VentureBeat, a rendering of the Google Pixel XL smartphone has been revealed, although like we said yesterday, since both phones are more or less identical in terms of design, it’s hard to tell which is which just from the renders alone. However in case you didn’t know, or could surmise from its name, the Google Pixel XL is rumored to be the bigger of both phones. The Pixel is said to sport a 5-inch Full HD display, while the Pixel XL is said to feature a 5.5-inch display QHD. Other than that, both phones will be identical in design and specs. What this means is that under the hood, both phones are rumored to pack a Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 chipset which has a quad-core processor clocked at 2.0GHz. We’re also looking a 4GB of RAM, 32GB of storage, a 12MP rear-facing camera, an 8MP front-facing camera, a fingerprint scanner on the back, and it is also expected to come with Android 7.1 Nougat preinstalled. Its battery size will be 2,770mAh for the Google Pixel, and 3,450mAh for the Google Pixel XL. In any case more details should be revealed on the 4th of October, so check back with us then for the official rundown. Filed in Cellphones >Rumors. Read more about Android, Google and pixel xl.

However there are parts of the world that aren’t so fortunate, and as you might have heard, companies such as Google are looking to change that by providing them with free access to internet. Google’s efforts in India have recently undergone a rebranding and will now be known as Google Station, and it seems that they won’t just stop there. Along with the rebranding, it seems that Google has plans to bring Google Station to other parts of the world in which it will provide users with high-speed WiFi. Right now Google Station is limited to India’s railroad stations, about 100 of them across the country. However Google is working with local companies such as RailTel and Indian Railways to bring WiFi to 300 more stations over the course of the next year. As we said, Google has plans to expand beyond India and are looking for international partners to help bring the service to other countries. Chances are for now Google will continue to focus on emerging markets since developed countries like the US already have public WiFi in certain areas, such as Starbucks, not to mention for the most part, internet is readily available.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Mail Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple Google’s slimmed-down YouTube Go app tailor-made for India’s unstable internet Kyle Wiggers Digital TrendsSeptember 27, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share Cellular networks in the developing world are notoriously unreliable, and that’s especially the case in India. Partly to blame are the country’s restrictive telecom regulations, which limit operators in the country to a narrow band of 3G spectrum — or just enough to deliver a maximum download speed of 21 Mbps. Unfortunately, the situation is unlikely to improve anytime soon. According to a report published by research firm HSBC Global Research, 4G adoption faces “significant technical challenges” — including internet speed, interference, poor coverage, and shortage of bandwidth — that threaten to prolong 4G deployment for years. Related: Pichai: India projects inspire improvements to Google services ‘around the world’ In the meantime, content platforms that depend on reliable connections are making due with stopforgaps. Social behemoth Facebook launched Facebook Lite, a bare-bones, slimmed-down networking client, in June of last year. Mobile messaging service Line rolled out a lightweight app last August. And in much the same spirit, Google unveiled YouTube Go, a new mobile client for YouTube, on Tuesday morning at an event in Dehli. Google describes YouTube Go as a new app “built from scratch” to bring YouTube to “the next generation of viewers” — folks saddled, in other words, with unstable internet. “We realized that for the next generation of YouTube users to fully discover all that YouTube has to offer, we had to reimagine the YouTube mobile app from the ground up,” YouTube’s Vice President of Product Management Johanna Wright wrote in a blog post. “[Indian viewers’] experience is not great on slower connections and less powerful mobile phones.” To aid in development, Wright and a team of “engineers, designers, and researchers” enlisted the help of YouTube users across India. “We have been traveling to India, collecting ideas and testing prototypes with hundreds of people across 15 cities,” she said. The culmination of that work, YouTube Go, is designed to work offline and on networks with “low connectivity,” and makes a concerted effort to reduce the amount of data consumed while video is being streamed or downloaded. Related: Google Station aims to offer fast, reliable Wi-Fi in public venues on global basis Not all of YouTube Go’s features are new, per se. In 2014, Google launched YouTube Offline, a setting within the YouTube app that lets users download videos. Smart Offline, which launched earlier this year, automatically schedules downloads on days and times when networks are least congested. youtube_goMore YouTube Go inherits both data-saving features and introduces new ones. A “preview” option lets users see a digest of videos before committing to a download, and new offline options include the ability to choose the resolution — and the amount of data, subsequently — of videos before they’re saved. YouTube Go’s other highlights, though, are of a decidedly more social flavor: A “find and discover” tab surfaces videos that are popular and trending nearby, and a “share nearby” tool allows users to send friends and family videos offline, without using any data. Read More Related: Everything you need to know about Google Assistant YouTube Go was one of several connectivity projects Google announced Tuesday. Another, Google Station, provides a set of tools that allows partners to deploy and monetize public Wi-Fi hot spots. An expanded Data Saver mode in Chrome for Mobile intelligently compresses webpages to speed up browsing. And an updated Google Play client will improve download speeds. All are scheduled to launch in India in the coming months. “In an increasingly mobile-first world, India gives us early insights into the future of the Internet,” Google CEO Sundar Pichai wrote in an op-ed for The Economic Times on Tuesday. “Moreover, we learned the issues Indians may have with connectivity and data constraints can be universal.” YouTube Go will make its public debut in the next few weeks, Google said, but interested testers in India can sign up for a beta program by visiting youtubego.com/signup.

Google has been aggressive in India to capture the mobile market that also has players like Microsoft among others. The new products were announced at the second edition of its signature ‘Google for India’ event. Google also plans to train two million mobile developers on Android. Over 1,20,000 students have already enrolled in the Android Fundamentals course, and by next college semester, 200,000 engineering students will be learning how to develop Android applications. Google is also funding the installation of Google Developers Codelabs at major state technical universities in India. “Our goal has not just been to help more Indians get online — but also help Indians create the online experience they want — one that serves their needs and enables them to have an impact on the entire world,” said Caesar Sengupta, Vice-President, Next Billion Users, Google. YouTube Go A new app designed that allows users to control over how much data they consume on videos. A user can preview videos first and later choose the video’s file size before they save it offline to watch. They can also share videos easily with friends nearby, without using any data at all. “Soon testers in India will be able to use YouTube Go before the the product becomes widely available,” said Johanna Wright, YouTube Vice-President for Product Management. Google Play on 2G: It allows fast browsing, uses preloading on Wi-Fi to load the most popular parts of Google Play quickly. And when a user on a low-bandwidth connection chooses to install an app, Google Play will offer a new “Wait for Wi-Fi” option where the app will only install when the phone next connects to Wi-Fi. Google Station: This new platform will work with partners to roll out Wi-Fi hotspots, offering carriers, system integrators (SIs), and venues an easy way to set up high-quality, user-friendly Wi-Fi. This will provide more people in India and around the world fast, reliable, and safe Wi-Fi in more of the places where they spend time, like malls, transit stations, and cafes. Google data Chrome: It reduces the amount of data, Chrome uses on Android mobile devices, computers, and Chromebooks. It will now support MP4 videos, saving up to over two-thirds (67%) of video data. Chrome on Android will now also automatically optimize pages to their essentials when 2G-like networks are detected. These simplified pages load up to 2X faster, saving more than 90% of data usage.

Resend activation e-mail Gear & Gadgets / Product News & Reviews Google Allo’s limitations explained in one word: “India” Allo isn’t built for a multi-device, connected world, but that’s probably on purpose. by Ron Amadeo - Sep 27, 2016 11:16 pm UTC Login to bookmark 114 The Google Logo for India Independence Day 2014. Google Doodles Google's new instant messaging client Allo doesn't seem like a compelling product. Allo is missing many of the basic features you might expect in an instant messaging app: it only works with one device at a time, it doesn't work on a desktop or laptop computer, it doesn't support tablets very well, it doesn't use a Google account, and it doesn't support SMS. Allo has had a curiously incomplete product launch, and many Google users are left wondering what the company was thinking. Allo's limitations are deal breakers for many people in the hyper-connected developed world who are accustomed to multiple devices and a few GBs of Internet connectivity. But what if you're not in a developed country? Google hasn't explicitly come out and said so, but Allo's features and Google's actions around the launch of Allo all point to it being targeted at developing countries, and one developing country in particular: India. When viewed through the lens of the average person in India, Allo's "incomplete" launch, odd design decisions, and missing features suddenly make sense. Google <3 India Google's love affair with India is no secret. Google is all about scale and having huge numbers of users, and if you look at a list of countries by population, China is first with 1.38 billion people; India is second with 1.32 billion people; and the United States is third, with 324 million people. Google would love to go to China, but that would mean dealing with the censorship-happy Chinese government, so India is the biggest country in the world where Google can freely do business. India is also the home country of Google CEO Sundar Pichai. Plenty of Google projects have targeted India. India was the first country to get the Android One phone, Google's program for cheap, high-quality Android phones. The company started a free Wi-Fi program in India by installing high-speed access points in the country's most popular train stations. Google just launched a custom version of YouTube for India called "YouTube Go." Google says the new YouTube Go app is designed to be "offline-first." It lets users download videos for later and share them to friends over a local network. If that's not enough evidence, Pichai just published an op-ed in The Economic Times of India explaining how Google is heavily targeting India. Google loves India. We're going to use India as our primary example to offer a theory on the design decisions around Allo and Duo, but our theory could probably apply to plenty of developing countries. Google Duo: A companion app to Allo, but also a companion to WhatsApp The weirdness in Google's current instant messaging strategy started right off the bat. Instead of announcing a single app that supports texting, voice, and video calls, Google split the video calls off into a separate app called "Duo." Allo and Duo would be "companion" apps, and users that want a typical instant messaging feature set would have to download both. Why have a split between Allo and Duo? Probably because Google was targeting WhatsApp users. With over a billion monthly active users, WhatsApp is the world's most popular messaging app. It's also the dominant form of communication in India, capturing 69 percent of Indian Internet users in Q4 2014, according to Statista. "WhatsApp Envy" is probably driving many of the decisions behind Allo and Duo—Google tried to buy WhatsApp in 2014 but was outbid by Facebook. WhatsApp doesn't support video calls, which could explain the split between Allo and Duo. Duo isn't just designed to be the video companion app to Allo—it might also be designed to be WhatsApp's video companion app. Isn't it weird that Duo supports video calls but not voice calls? It's less weird when you consider WhatsApp already supports voice calls, so that would be a redundant feature in the WhatsApp/Duo pairing. Duo launched a full month before its supposed "companion app," Allo, which is suspicious timing. Allo was clearly the more exciting app, so why get Duo out the door first? Probably because WhatsApp has a video calling feature in beta testing, and Google wanted to beat WhatsApp to the punch.

Here's How Google Plans To Bring Faster Wi-Fi To The World By Karen Tumbokon On 09/27/16 AT 7:14 PM Close Google has been working with RailTel and Indian Railways to bring Wi-Fi to railway stations across India. Today, the company announced Google Station which will bring fast Wi-Fi service to more locations around India and around the world. Google Station is looking to expand those partnerships to places like cafes, malls and transit stations. In an official statement, Google’s vice president of Product Management, Caesar Sengupta said the company’s goal isn’t just about getting more Indians online, but giving them the “online experience they want; one that services their needs and enables them to have an impact on the entire world."  Google claims the service is currently live in 52 stations and more than 3.5 million users use it every month. Google also claims that 15,000 Indians access the internet for the first time using free Wi-Fi service. On its website, Google encourages people to connect with the company to see how they can bring the internet to more people. “We’ll be partnering with large venues and organizations, network operators, fiber providers, system integrators and infrastructure companies.” Related Stories 18 Things Google Can Do Now That It's 18 At an event on Tuesday, Google’s vice-president for Indian and Southeast Asia Rajan Anandan also talked about training more than two million mobile developers on Android.

By Ben Rosen, Staff September 27, 2016 Save for later Saved Voters cast their ballots in the Illinois primary in Hinsdale, Ill., March 18, 2014. As various social media platforms push for voter registration, some states say they are seeing record registration rates. M. Spencer Green/AP/File View Caption About video ads View Caption of Facebook, SnapChat, and Twitter are rocking voter registration. The social media networks are part of a national voter registration campaign that has seen records set in numerous states since Facebook first started to nudge its users on Friday. “Going back to 2008, we’ve been reminding people on Facebook to vote on Election Day and directing them to information on where to vote,” said Samidh Chakrabarti, who manages civic engagement products for Facebook. “ This is the natural next step.” Recommended: How is money reshaping American politics? Take our quiz. And what a next step it’s been. Georgia’s online voter registration system, for instance, recorded a 2,500 percent increase in the number of requests it received over the same day last year. As results continue to come in from different states, #NationalVoterRegistrationDay has shown web and social media platforms are a powerful tool to combat the fact that a third of eligible Americans do not vote on Election Day. Test your knowledge How is money reshaping American politics? Take our quiz. Photos of the Day Photos of the Day 11/18 The idea for the campaign, whose 4,000 partners also include Google, Tumblr, and Reddit, was born in 2008, when about 6 million people were unable to vote because they did not register, either because they didn’t know about or missed a deadline, according to NationalVoterRegistrationDay.org. " We want everyone to celebrate," Matt Singer, founder of the movement, told CNET. "A lot of web platforms are known for having a young audience, like Tumblr, but ... I think everyone in America uses Google." Facebook kicked things off Friday, displaying a reminder at the top of newsfeeds. The pinned post showed users above the age of 18 how to vote and which of their friends have already registered. Google has also been offering a tool that includes options for registration, as well as deadlines in your state. This year, the search engine also added voter registration in Spanish. Twitter rolled out the official #iRegistered hashtag complete with an emoji of an American flag top hat over 2016. #NationalVoterRegistrationDay was also trending on Twitter, according to USA Today. All the sites participating directed users to a federal website that linked them to voter registration pages for their home states. In addition to Georgia, 47,000 Minnesotans updated their registrations or registered for the first time over the weekend, according to the Minnesota Secretary of State. On just Friday, almost 27,000 users accessed the system, nearly four times more than the previous one-day record. More than 25,000 residents in both Kentucky and in Indiana updated their registration or registered for the first time, according to The Hill. Almost 200,000 registered voters in California created or updated their records on Monday alone, the second most active day since the state’s online registration was created, according to Secretary of State Alex Padilla. More than 60 percent of these Californians were under the age of 35, and a third were under 25, according to The Hill. These statistics stand in stark contrast to the 35 percent of US citizens eligible to vote in 2012 that were not registered, according to census data. It also shows the evolution of voter registration efforts, since social media platforms have used their sites to encourage voters to turn out. “While politically active citizens have for years tried to track down unregistered, yet eligible, voters and coax them to the polls by knocking on doors or setting up informational booths, the presence of more subtle nudges on social media could help to determine Facebook’s influence on voting behavior,” writes Amanda Hoover for The Christian Science Monitor. Before today, the social media platform had estimated that its reminders influenced 1.5 million people to register when it started the notifications during the primaries, according to USA Today.    Facebook and other sites also have a proven record of persuading voters to turn out to the polls. A study by published in Nature found that in the 2010 congressional elections, 340,000 additional people voted because of Facebook reminders. “While the network’s push helped, users who saw that their closest friends had clicked an 'I voted' button on the site were even more likely to vote,” writes Ms. Hoover. Other states are still sifting through the weekend data, according to The Hill. But many expect to set similar one-day records. Next up Test your knowledge How is money reshaping American politics?

Language Log Home About Comments policy Google Translate is even better now September 27, 2016 @ 5:59 pm · Filed by Victor Mair under translation « previous post | next post » According to these two articles, Google Translate is taking a quantum leap forward in the quality of its services, starting with Mandarin to English: "Google says its new AI-powered translation tool scores nearly identically to human translators" (Quartz, 9/27/16) "An Infusion of AI Makes Google Translate More Powerful Than Ever" (WIRED, 9/27/16) Below are two letters that I received from China last week.  The English translations are unretouched.  You be the judge. 1.

Lǐ Yán, fā zì Běijīng 梅维恒教授： 您好！我是北京《新京报·书评周刊》的记者李妍，《新京报·书评周刊》是中国一家非常有影响力的文化副刊，关注各学科领域的新书、好书，采访过各国著名的作家、学者等。 您主编的《哥伦比亚中国文学史》中译本今年7月由新星出版社出版，对于这样一本厚重的、重要的海外文学史著作，我非常关注和喜悦。我本人在学校学的专业是中国文学，《哥伦比亚中国文学史》的架构、分析都让我感到新鲜和有启发。 不知您是否愿意就《哥伦比亚中国文学史》接受我们的邮件采访？主要关于这本书的编写和内容。如果您同意，我会在一星期左右发去我的采访问题，您可以在方便的时间作答。 以及，这封邮件我冒昧使用了中文，如果您更愿意用英文交流和回复，我下次会在邮件中使用英文。 期待您的回复，祝健康、顺利！ 李妍，发自北京 Professor Mei Weiheng: Hello! I am a reporter in Beijing, "Beijing News Weekly" reporter Li Yan, "Beijing News Weekly Review" is a very influential Chinese cultural supplement, concerned about the subject areas of the book, a good book, interviewed the famous Writers, scholars and so on. You edited the translation of "History of Chinese Literature in Colombia" published in July this year by the Rising Star Publishing House, for such a heavy, important overseas literature history books, I am very concerned about and joy. I am in the school of professional Chinese literature, "Colombian Chinese literature history" of the structure, analysis makes me feel fresh and inspiring. I wonder if you would like to receive an e-mail interview on "The History of Chinese Literature in Colombia". Mainly on the preparation and content of this book. If you agree, I will send my interview questions in about a week. You can answer them at your convenience. And, I take the liberty of using this message in Chinese, if you prefer to communicate in English and reply, I will use the next message in English. Look forward to your reply, I wish healthy, smooth! Li Yan, from Beijing One thing I can say for sure is that Google Translate for Mandarin is much better than this human being, who just keeps smiling through the debacle of his inept interpreting. [h.t. Ben Zimmer, Michael Carr; thanks to Mark Swofford] Sharing: Tweet September 27, 2016 @ 5:59 pm · Filed by Victor Mair under translation Permalink 36 Comments maidhc said, September 27, 2016 @ 6:30 pm "I wish healthy, smooth" is not idiomatic in English. I'm guessing this is some kind of conventional phrase in Mandarin? There are a few awkward spots but it is quite understandable. Tim Martin said, September 27, 2016 @ 6:51 pm Eh. I believe them if they say Google translates better than it used to (I have no idea how good the English/Mandarin translations were before), but these translations certainly aren't as good as human translations, and they have obvious grammatical errors and nonsensical parts. I'll be interested to see what the new Japanese/English translations were like, since I am more qualified to judge those, and they were pretty abysmal before! Thorin said, September 27, 2016 @ 7:46 pm Well, at least for the time being I still have a job. Rubrick said, September 27, 2016 @ 10:58 pm Based solely on the quality of the English (I don't know MSM), I'd say that Google might well have achieved the quality of an average translator (whatever that means), but still has a substantial way to go to reach the level of a truly good translator. Whether the remainder falls quickly or slowly is hard to predict. (I was among those who mistakenly thought top human Go players would hold out a while longer.) Regardless, these results are very impressive — mind-bogglingly so, really, except that we've sort of become numb to Clarke's Law. (When's the last time you were properly dumbfounded by Google search?) Victor Mair said, September 27, 2016 @ 11:32 pm @Rubrick I am both dumbfounded and grateful every single time I do a Google search. I simply cannot comprehend how the Google search engine works so quickly and so well, even to the point of helping me figure out what questions I want to ask it! Ivan said, September 28, 2016 @ 2:22 am Google says its new AI-powered translation tool scores nearly identically to human translators -> Google стверджує, що її новий AI-електрорегулювання бали інструмент перекладу майже ідентично людини перекладачів (Google affirms that her new AI-electric-regulation grades instrument of translation almost in identical manner to the human of translators) Nope, still mostly nonsense. E.T. said, September 28, 2016 @ 3:14 am I work as an English->certain European language translator, and mostly I work for Chinese companies. I can attest that these translations are on par with the source material I have to work with. Ari Corcoran said, September 28, 2016 @ 4:57 am @Ivan said. Thus far only available in Mandarin>English, with more to follow so your comparison is yet to be tested. I use Google to translate Italian>English and English>Italian, and find it, at best, good to get a fast general sense when I don't have time to go through it myself in detail (and I am not very good). Have given up on "correcting" as none of my suggestions have apparently been taken up. For example, in a recent statement from the Mayor of Palermo, clearly about an anti-Mafia campaign, Google insisted "il pizzo" should be rendered as "lace", instead of corrupt payment, with no alternate translation available (though if you enter the word "il pizzo" by itself, it does give alternatives). What Google will never be able to do is translate crap from one language to the other. Both the Quartz and Wired articles have sentences which are gibberish. Ralph Hickok said, September 28, 2016 @ 6:43 am I do quite a bit of online editing through a website called Upwork. I frequently see people looking for someone to edit Google translations and I've taken on a few of those jobs. It takes more work than does writing by a native English speaker/writer. Over the last five years or so, I've done a lot of ESL editing and editing a Google translation is comparable. It takes some effort. I should probably add that most of the ESL editing I've done has been for Europeans, although I have done some for Asians, whose writing typically takes a little more effort. I think the big difference is that Asians writing in English tend to misuse articles or omit them entirely. Christian Saunders said, September 28, 2016 @ 8:39 am I agree, totally indistinguishable from human translation. I wish you all healthy, smooth. languagehat said, September 28, 2016 @ 8:39 am "Google says its new AI-powered translation tool scores nearly identically to human translators" Why do they feel compelled to engage in this hype? If they simply said "Google says its new AI-powered translation tool has made a vast improvement," I would have been impressed and, based on the samples provided, agreed. To say it's comparable to human translators is ludicrous, and I'm shocked Rubrick said "Google might well have achieved the quality of an average translator" — he must have a very low opinion of the average translator! Seriously: "so take the liberty to write to ask"? "If you are convenient"? "concerned about the subject areas of the book, a good book, interviewed the famous Writers, scholars and so on"? " for such a heavy, important overseas literature history books, I am very concerned about and joy"? "I will use the next message in English"? If I'd paid a human to produce that gibberish, I would not only never use them again, I would demand my money back. Can't we be content with Google doing a good job for a free service and not leap straight to "Welp, professional translators had better start looking for new lines of work"? Christian Saunders said, September 28, 2016 @ 9:16 am Just used it on some English > Spanish text. Bad! ORIGINAL ENGLISH It's lunchtime for one little girl, but she's just not hungry. A visiting crocodile, bear, and wolf, however, are starving. It's just as well that children taste revolting. SPANISH Es la hora del almuerzo para una niña, pero ella no es sólo hambre. Un cocodrilo de visita, oso, lobo y, sin embargo, se mueren de hambre. Es igual de bien que los niños sabor repugnante. SamC said, September 28, 2016 @ 10:01 am I use Google translate often at work for materials I get from our German office – and will sometimes even use it to double check clumsy English translations. Even for a language very close to English, Google translate is not at the level of an actual translator. It's very close to the level of comprehension & accuracy I get from colleagues who are not professional translators, and who speak English as a second language fluently enough for business but who would struggle at a dinner party. Google is also still terrible at anything resembling jargon, I think. The examples above use very general language, but try a text on manufacturing and see what happens. GH said, September 28, 2016 @ 12:24 pm @Christian Saunders, SamC: Again, this is about the quality of Google's new translation technology, which is reportedly significantly better than what they currently offer. Past experience and tests with any language pair other than English–Mandarin are not relevant. @languagehat: If you read the Quartz article, it is clear that they are referring to some specific test, and saying that the new technology scores almost as well as a human. The exact test is not specified, but Wikipedia has an article on various evaluations of machine translations. The article also doesn't describe which human translators the automatic translation are being compared to, or under what conditions they produce the translation. Clearly the result is not as good as what you should expect from trained translators working carefully with unlimited time, but it seems plausible that it could be comparable to what you get from bilingual speakers doing a single-pass translation. If the human translations were produced by Amazon Mechanical Turk workers ("turkers"), for example, I am surprised they were even as good as this. languagehat said, September 28, 2016 @ 1:07 pm If you read the Quartz article, it is clear that they are referring to some specific test, and saying that the new technology scores almost as well as a human. That may very well be, but the headline is still ridiculous hype; it clearly implies "GT is just about as good as human translators now!" Hype is not straight-out lies, it is misleading exaggeration based (usually) on a layer of fact. K. Chang said, September 28, 2016 @ 3:20 pm Argh. The two samples reminded me of compositions I wrote in the first year I started learning English. Basically, I was writing Chinese but in English . E. T. said, September 28, 2016 @ 4:41 pm @languagehat It's certainly not as good as a qualified translator, no. Unfortunately, the general quality level in the business is very low, especially when it comes to Chinese->English. Hardly anyone bothers to pay for a native English speaker, even if just for proofreading. People are indeed paid (pitiful amounts of) money to produce translations that are comparable to what Google Translate now offer. I see these translations every single day. There are of course many very qualified translators doing excellent work, but in terms of the massive volume of text that is translated from Chinese to English every day, the standard is astonishingly low. languagehat said, September 28, 2016 @ 4:49 pm E.T.: I understand that. If you think "Google says its new AI-powered translation tool scores nearly identically to human translators" is intended to imply "Google's new AI-powered translation tool is about as good as the very worst nonprofessional human translators," you're entitled to your opinion, but I will continue to disagree. Frankly, it's astonishing to me how many people insist on giving the benefit of the doubt to a Google press release. Thorin said, September 28, 2016 @ 5:00 pm @languagehat I'm also concerned by the implication in the headline that the quality provided by the update is on par with a human translation. I've been a full-time translator for eight years now, and don't really like seeing my profession compared to the low quality of the translations that came out for Victor. E. T. said, September 28, 2016 @ 5:49 pm I am basing my evaluation on the examples that prof. Mair posted. Certainly, the Silicon Valley hype is ridiculous; I don't think anyone is arguing otherwise, and I certainly did not mean to say what you appear to have read into my words. Still, and this is all I wanted to get across, I believe you would be astonished to see the texts that Chinese->English translators turn in every day. Given that numerous companies find these translations acceptable and agree to pay for them, these translators are not nonprofessional (one could argue they are unprofessional). These translators' jobs could conceivably be replaced by machines in the near future. languagehat said, September 28, 2016 @ 7:12 pm Certainly, the Silicon Valley hype is ridiculous; I don't think anyone is arguing otherwise, and I certainly did not mean to say what you appear to have read into my words. Well, then, we're in agreement. I'm sure I would be appalled by the kinds of human translations you're talking about! Jim Breen said, September 28, 2016 @ 7:26 pm I'll certainly be waiting with interest to see how the revised GT works with other language pairs. especially Japanese-English. Certainly the Chinese-English samples Victor posted are impressive, as are the ones quoted in Google's own announcement (https://research.googleblog.com/2016/09/a-neural-network-for-machine.html). Getting an LSTM-based system to this stage is quite a feat. GH said, September 28, 2016 @ 8:49 pm I do not agree that the headline is "Silicon Valley hype" (nor is the article, as far as I can tell, a press release); I think it's a perfectly defensible journalistic summary of the results of their tests. The evaluation in which the algorithm nearly matches human translations is clearly stated to be a score on standardized tests (which implies all kinds of limitations), and nowhere does it suggest that the human translators whose work they compared it against were trained experts. The details are presented in a Google Research blog post and a paper on arxiv.org. They seem to have run two rounds of comparison against human translations. One used the newstest-2014 parallel text corpus for an English-to-French translation (without downloading the dataset, it's not immediately clear where the translations in this parallel corpus come from). Another (which appears to be the one depicted in the graph on the blog) tested a number of language pairs, and used "500 randomly sampled sentences from Wikipedia and news websites" as the test set, with the human translations prepared specially. The translators in this second task and the translation raters in both tasks are described only as "humans fluent in both languages." Since no further details are given, I think it's safe to assume they were not professionals in the field. (I tend to think such details really ought to be reported, along with more information about the rating procedure, how many raters took part, inter-rater agreement, etc. But I guess it's a paper written by engineers…) maidhc said, September 29, 2016 @ 1:43 am I tried running an article from the Irish Times through Google (An cúl báire). The translation was terrible. It didn't really come up to the level of being called a translation at all. The Mandarin examples were much better even though they were awkward and ungrammatical. At least you could more or less figure out the meaning. I suppose they have a much bigger corpus for Mandarin and they spend more time on it because it's a more widely spoken language. Jon said, September 29, 2016 @ 1:53 am If Google can acheive that level of accuracy with Latin to English, I would be delighted. I research early medical texts (scanned thanks to the Internet Achive and Google), many in Latin. The current translations are not completely useless – you can often get some idea of the topic under discussion – but no idea of the sense. Jim Breen said, September 29, 2016 @ 2:07 am @maidhc The new version of GT is only running with Chinese-English.What you're seeing with Irish is the old system. I guess the availability of Irish-English parallel corpora may be a bit limited. Tommi Nieminen said, September 29, 2016 @ 4:25 am The quality seems very impressive for MT, I just wish Google hadn't mentioned the blatantly flawed human/machine translation comparison, since that's obviously going to be the focus of the press coverage. We can see from professor Mair's examples that the translations are nowhere near as good as those produced by a professional translator, but in the comparison almost 3/5 of the machine translated sentences were judged perfect translations (same proportion as for human translation). This indicates 1. that the translators were substandard and 2. the criteria for a perfect translation were very permissive. Would be nice to see this test performed with conventional expectations for translator competence and translation quality. GH said, September 29, 2016 @ 4:55 am Here are some examples from their actual test data (English to French): Original: "The reason Boeing are doing this is to cram more seats in to make their plane more competitive with our products," said Kevin Keniston, head of passenger comfort at Europe’s Airbus. Machine Translation: "La raison pour laquelle Boeing fait cela est de créer plus de sièges pour rendre son avion plus compétitif avec nos produits", a déclaré Kevin Keniston, chef du confort des passagers chez Airbus. (6/6) Human Translation: "Boeing fait ça pour pouvoir caser plus de sièges et rendre ses avions plus compétitifs par rapports à nos produits", a déclaré Kevin Keniston, directeur de Confort Passager chez l’avionneur européen Airbus. (6/6) Original: Martin told CNN that he asked Daley whether his then-boss knew about the potential shuffle. MT: Martin a dit à CNN qu’il avait demandé à Daley si son patron d’alors était au courant du remaniement potentiel. (6/6) HT: Martin a dit sur CNN qu’il avait demandé à Daley si son patron d’alors était au courant du remaniement éventuel. (5/6) Original: She was spotted three days later by a dog walker trapped in the quarry MT: Elle a été repérée trois jours plus tard par un traîneau à chiens piégé dans la carrière. (2/6) HT: Elle a été repérée trois jours plus tard par une personne qui promenait son chien coincée dans la carrière (5/6) (Note that this last example is ambiguous and confusing if not outright wrong in its original English version.) Ralph Hickok said, September 29, 2016 @ 8:31 am I can't help wondering how classic literary translations would fare on that test. For example, Constance Garnett's translations of Dostoyevsky, Gogol, and other Russian writers, or the Muirs' translations of Kafka. John Frier said, September 29, 2016 @ 11:42 am Why choose formal letters for checking the quality of translation? Here is a random sample from Chinese Wikipedia: 另有一說，在14世紀時中葉期的歐洲，正被黑死病壟罩著，威尼斯也不例外，當時因世紀黑死病死亡者多達威尼斯三分之一的人口，屍體的快速暴增，只好藉由貢多拉運送，政府也嚴禁奢華浪費風氣，而用黑色表對黑死病的哀悼，一直沿用至今。 Google "translation": Another one said that in the mid-14th century Europe, is being covered by the Black Death Ridge, Venice is no exception, because the death of the Black Death of the century up to one-third of the population of Venice, the rapid explosion of the body , Had to transport by gondola, the government is strictly prohibited luxury waste of culture, and black table with the black death of the mourning, has been in use ever since. Huh??? maidhc said, September 29, 2016 @ 3:15 pm I tried another experiment, this time with Spanish. I used another newspaper article, 6 platillos que NO son comida mexicana. It is mostly understandable. Considering that it is talking about food, mostly the names of various dishes are handled properly. But there are some problems: "Este platillo le encanta a Donald Trump y hasta asegura que en el restaurante de la Trump Tower de Nueva York preparan el mejor del mundo." This dish loves Donald Trump and even says that in the restaurant Trump Tower New York prepared the best in the world. Misses prepositions and the synthetic verbs. "Y cómo no, no porque sean verdes significa que se pueden juntar con el aguacate." And of course, not because they are green means that can be combined with avocado. If you didn't speak any Spanish, it's much better than nothing. And I did learn the Spanish for "Yuck"–guácala. I hope. I understand that the improvements have not yet been applied to Spanish, so I will be interested to see whether the translation will improve in the future. Eidolon said, September 29, 2016 @ 5:40 pm The new system works only for Mandarin Chinese->English, from what I understand, so I put it to the test on what should be the most obvious use case: news translation. "本报北京9月29日电 （记者杨晔）国家主席习近平29日在人民大会堂同白俄罗斯总统卢卡申科举行会谈。两国元首决定建立相互信任、合作共赢的中白全面战略伙伴关系，发展双方全天候友谊，携手打造利益共同体和命运共同体。 习近平指出，中白是肝胆相照的好朋友和真诚互助的好伙伴。当前两国交流合作的紧密程度超过历史任何时期，双边关系发展正在迈向更高层次。中方愿意同白方一道，维护好中白关系发展的强劲势头，抓住共建“一带一路”带来的难得机遇，为两国关系发展注入新的强劲动力，更好造福两国人民。 习近平强调，中白要加大相互支持力度，筑牢政治互信基石。两国应该保持高层交往势头，在涉及彼此核心利益问题上坚定相互支持。双方要实现各自发展战略对接，拉紧共同利益纽带。要加快共建“一带一路”，并共同推进“一带一路”建设同欧亚经济联盟建设有效对接。要加强经贸投资合作，促进双边贸易平衡发展，深化机电、高新技术、质检和标准化领域合作，争取交通、物流、能源、信息技术、机械制造等领域合作实现早期收获。要加快中白工业园建设，拓展地方合作，实现优势互补和协同发展。双方要加强安全合作，维护共同安全利益。要深化人文交流，促进民心相通。中方支持在白俄罗斯开设更多孔子学院和孔子课堂，鼓励两国青年学生开展交流互访。要进一步便利双方人员往来，希望双方规划好明年中白建交25周年庆祝活动。双方要加大在国际和地区事务中的协调和配合。中方愿意同白方在联合国、上海合作组织、亚信等多边框架内深化合作，推动国际秩序朝着更加公正合理的方向发展。" "BEIJING, Sept. 29 (Xinhuanet) – Chinese President Xi Jinping held talks with Belarussian President Lukashenko here Tuesday at the Great Hall of the People. The two heads of state decided to establish a comprehensive strategic partnership of mutual trust, cooperation and win-win situation, to develop all-weather friendship between the two sides, to work together to create a community of interests and the fate of the community. Xi Jinping pointed out that the white is a good friend in good faith and mutual assistance in good partner. At present, bilateral exchanges and cooperation are closer than any other time in history, and the development of bilateral relations is moving towards a higher level. China is ready to work with White to safeguard the momentum of the development of China-Belarus relations and seize the rare opportunity brought about by the "one-way-all-the-way" approach to inject new and powerful momentum for the development of bilateral relations and better benefit the two peoples. Xi stressed that China and Belarus should increase mutual support and build a solid foundation for political mutual trust. The two countries should maintain the momentum of high-level exchanges and firmly support each other in their core interests. The two sides should realize their respective development strategies and link up their common interests. To speed up the build "along the way", and jointly promote the "all along the way" construction and Eurasian economic alliance building effective docking. We should strengthen cooperation in economic and trade investment, promote the balanced development of bilateral trade, deepen cooperation in electromechanical, high-tech, quality inspection and standardization, and strive for early harvest in the fields of transportation, logistics, energy, information technology and machinery manufacturing. To speed up the construction of the White Industrial Park, expand local cooperation and realize complementary advantages and coordinated development. The two sides should strengthen security cooperation and safeguard common security interests. We should deepen cultural exchanges and promote people's hearts. The Chinese side supports the opening of more Confucius Institutes and Confucius Classrooms in Belarus to encourage exchange of visits between young students of the two countries. It is necessary to further facilitate personnel exchanges between the two sides and hope that both sides will plan for the 25th anniversary celebration of diplomatic relations between China and Belarus next year. The two sides should increase coordination and cooperation in international and regional affairs. China is willing to deepen cooperation with White in multilateral frameworks such as the United Nations, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and AsiaInfo, and promote the international order towards a more just and rational direction." My conclusion: the English translation is, in fact, *much* improved over the previous version of translate, though unfortunately Google has taken that version down, so it is difficult to put them side by side. The most obvious area of improvement is that the translation appears more, now, to be a coherent group of sentences, rather than a sequence of disconnected words. I am excited for the future of this technology and what it can do for other languages. Greg said, September 29, 2016 @ 6:43 pm Mostly @VM but really for anyone: Does anyone have a substantial text (full letter or several paragraphs, like your examples) you Google-translated in the past (original + translation)? I'd love to see the progression over time. What sorts of things were mistranslated in the past, but better now? Anything come out worse? Have you done this before? John Frier said, September 29, 2016 @ 8:59 pm News about political visits, formal letters etc are extremely clichéed. The sad fact is that beyond this Google fails. Does anybody think that "the rapid explosion of the body , Had to transport by gondola, the government is strictly prohibited luxury waste of culture, and black table with the black death of the mourning" can be called a translation? Francis Boyle said, September 30, 2016 @ 10:10 am It's strikes me that complaining that these translations (the one in Professor Mair's post that is) aren't up to the standard of a good professional translation is like objecting that extemporaneous speech is up to the standard of a professionally edited text. (Insert your own Trump joke here.) @John Frier The text makes a lot more sense (in fact, is completely understandable to me) once you know that it is explaining why Venetian gondolas are black. Which is not surprising really given Google's top down approach. languagehat said, September 30, 2016 @ 10:23 am It's strikes me that complaining that these translations (the one in Professor Mair's post that is) aren't up to the standard of a good professional translation is like objecting that extemporaneous speech is up to the standard of a professionally edited text. Is anyone complaining about that in this thread? I'm certainly not, and in fact I've frequently countered such complaints with fervent gratitude that such a service exists at all, that translations from languages I don't know are made freely available. As long as I can get even a general sense of what the original says, I'm not going to gripe about the quality. What I'm complaining about is the implication in the Quartz headline cited above, and presumptively in the Google press release that lies behind the news stories, that the New! Improved! GT is pretty much as good as (not stated, but left for you to imagine) professional human translators. Of course if you click through and read the actual study you'll realize that's not what's being said, but readers should not be compelled to go to such lengths to figure out the news. I don't like being lied to, directly or by implication; it's the business of flacks to lie, and it should be the business of news reports to counter such lies.

It’s the latest in a wave of natural-language chatbots and “assistants” that have been rolled out by big tech companies over the last few years — think Apple’s Siri, Amazon’s Alexa, Microsoft’s Cortana, and Facebook’s M. To hear futurists, developers, and investors talk, the chatbot (and its associated technologies, voice recognition and natural-language processing) is the future of computing, and the way we’ll be interacting with our phones, computers, and even our homes. So far, though, the chatbots we use have only been successful in a limited way. Actual conversational bots trip up, get words wrong, misunderstand, and often times offend. Siri has an incredibly hard time understanding accents; “clever” lines from the always-listening Alexa become inadvertently creepy when their timing is off. Conversation and common sense, which run on experience, empathy, intuition, and emotional understanding, are hard to teach and encode. Humanity is hard to program. Nevertheless, the companies that make these bots want you to think of them as human. They’re named and gendered; they have personality traits and serve up pithy prewritten responses. This kind of anthropomorphization is a specific design decision intended to create an implied interaction pattern: conversation. But you’re not really talking to the bot, are you? Anything that Cortana or Siri says in response to a person has been vetted by lots of people at Apple and Microsoft; Facebook’s M similarly has someone behind the curtain. As a designer with bots and AI, I wonder why we insist on interaction paradigms that require so much maintenance, and still seem so likely to fail. When we give bots freedom, but still demand they follow the rules of conversation, the results can be disastrous. Microsoft’s attempt to create a Twitter bot that could respond and interact like a teenage girl, was a great example of trying to leap forward toward human conversation and utterly failing. “Tay,” as the bot was called, was extremely “smart.” It could learn and expand its vocabulary very quickly through interacting with other Twitter users. It could understand basic grammar: A sentence consists of a noun and verb and maybe some other words. But Tay’s intelligence only went so far. It didn’t understand what words meant. “I love food” was, as far as Tay was concerned, identical to “I love Hitler.” People — 4channers — were able to use Tay’s intelligence against it, and Tay, in less than 24 hours, was spewing genocidal, misogynistic bile. Contrast Tay to the now-defunct BBC Weather bot. Users could tweet a location and a date — something like “Westhampton tomorrow” — and the bot would respond with the weather. The bot did what bots do best, which is quickly and effectively parse information to return a very relevant response. Instead of trying to be “human,” it was just “botty” — and it worked well, and never once advocated for genocide. Artificial intelligence doesn’t mean higher intelligence, and it certainly doesn’t mean human intelligence. I think we have trouble creating great bots that work on their own because we continue to insist that they act more like cheery, witty humans than like the mechanical automatons they are. Why should I be obligated to speak with Google’s Allo as though it’s another person? Why does Alexa need zingers, and why does Microsoft want a bot that sounds like a teenager? What’s wrong with images, menu options, or even adorable R2-D2 noises? Why not create a botlike version of something as fantastic as terrapattern — a website using machine learning to show patterns in Google image data sets. Bots could be extensions of ourselves, the human creators, to help augment our processes, instead of personified service AIs. Computers are really great at processing information, of holding a lot of data, but really bad at understanding intention and empathizing with users. Those qualities are what humans do really well. The design researcher Alexis Lloyd has spoken about this idea of “bottiness,” most recently at the Eyeo Festival. “Bottiness,” she says, is “about a bot expressing itself in a way that is keeping with its processes and functions […] when I think about how bots express themselves, they don’t speak English, but they present themselves in a way that sets them apart from the expectations we bring to human conversation.” Lloyd brings up R2-D2, who “speaks this language everyone can interpret even if you don’t necessarily literally understand it.” Actual conversations involve a lot of nuances — on the linguistic level, on the cultural level, even on the physical level. Human conversations are hard enough for humans! So why are we so eager to see bots excel at something that many people are themselves barely competent at?

You can stay abreast of friends’ shenanigans, watch funny cat videos, or check your latest bank statement — and that’s just scratching the surface. But it’s difficult to do anything of those things if you’re stuck with an unreliable cellular or Wi-Fi connection, and that’s why Google is doing the best it can to mitigate such circumstances. At a press conference in Delhi, India, on Tuesday, it announced a new version of Chrome for Android with features focused on connectivity. “We want to make Chrome a better place for all our users to enjoy the mobile web,” said Rahul Roy-Chowdhury, Chrome’s vice president of product and data minimalist. “Chrome’s new features on Data Saver, downloads, and content discovery were designed to help you do more on the web, no matter what phone or network you may have.” First up: an enhanced Data Saver. The mode, which debuted on Chrome last year, speeds up web browsing by compressing the content of web pages via dedicated Google servers. Images are converted to the highly efficient WebP format, and text is rendered at a lower fidelity. Related: An Android and Chrome OS merger may be in the works The new and improved Data Saver is more versatile. It can compress video, and quite efficiently: A typical MP4 file with Data Saver enabled takes up to 67 percent less data. And Web Light, a feature which intelligently strips pages of unnecessary images and background elements, has been folded into Data Saver after launching in Indonesia last year. The improvements together result in page loading times up to two times faster than average and a reduction in data usage of up to 90 percent, Google said. The improvements aren’t all technical. Offline Downloads, a feature that made an appearance in the developer edition of Chrome in early September, lets users download images, videos, and web pages for offline viewing in a designated Downloads section within the Chrome menu. Downloads pause if the internet connection is interrupted and automatically resume when a new connection’s established. google_chrome_featuresMore Related: Get multitasking: Chrome 54 for Android plays videos in the background The “new tab” experience in Chrome is changing. Currently, opening a new tab surfaces suggestions for websites to visit — an interface that will soon be supplanted with a personalized list of pages, articles, and “the latest buzz from the web.” Suggestions will improve over time, Google said, based on preferences like sports team and favorite websites. The improved Data Saver is live on all versions of Chrome, Google said. Offline Downloads and the revamped “new tabs” screen are coming a bit later — they’ll launch on the beta version of Chrome before hitting the stable channel. The Chrome announcements were a part of a Google event in India focused on connectivity. The others were YouTube Go, a slimmed-down YouTube client optimized for unstable internet connections; Google Station, a platform that allows partners to deploy and monetize public Wi-Fi hot spots; and an updated Google Play client with improved download speeds. google_chrome_download_sectionMore Read More Related: Google reaches for the stars with rumored do-it-all laptop running new ‘Andromeda’ OS Most are debuting in India first, a strategy Google CEO Sundar Pichai explained in an op-ed piece in The Economic Times. “[We] learned the issues Indians may have with connectivity, and data constraints can be universal,” he wrote. “We dreamed up Maps Offline for India, but people in the United States and Europe are finding it just as useful.

The company has not only updated the app to an include an incognito mode, but it is also taking steps toward making those searches more secure. For example, the company is letting you lock up private searches with Touch ID, essentially meaning that if someone else gets their mitts on your phone, they will not be able to access the private, incognito tabs you opened. Related: Google’s Pixel phones get more details, fun color names ahead of launch The change will make using incognito tabs a lot more convenient. Currently, Google does not close incognito tabs when you leave the app, so by requiring users have their fingerprint read by Touch ID, Google is removing one of the only drawbacks of incognito tabs — the possibility that friends can easily open up your phone and see what you have been doing. It is important to keep in mind that there are a few limitations to incognito mode — your internet service provider, and possibly your employer if you are using the internet at work, can still see what you are searching. If you are searching for things through the Google search engine, Google will be able to see what you search too, so keep that in mind. Along with these new features, Google also updated the app to allow for YouTube videos to be watches in Search. All you have to do is search for a video and it will show up, then you can hit the play button. Last but not least, Google tweaked the code of the app to make it less likely to crash — a nice change for those that use the Google iOS app a lot. 15 useful Google Maps tips and tricks you need to know about 5 awesome web browsers for Android 25 iPhone 6S problems and how to fix them Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share What to Read Next Best Buy’s pre-Black Friday 2016 sale is live right now – here are the 20 best deals BGR News iOS 10 Hidden Feature: The Magnifier Yahoo Tech China astronauts return from monthlong space station stay Associated Press New hybrid console takes Nintendo on the go Yahoo Tech AirSelfie drone is small enough to stow away in a phone case Digital Trends This smart crib will help your baby sleep safely through the night Yahoo Tech Russia has now officially blocked LinkedIn BGR News Privacy |Terms |About our Ads |Suggestions Brought to you by Yahoo News Network

The latest to benefit is Translate with a new Google Neural Machine Translation (GNMT) system that reduces errors by 55% to 85%. The system is already in use 18 million times per day with the notoriously hard language pairing of Chinese to English. Compared to the previous phrase-based production system, GNMT reduces translation errors by 55% to 85% on several major language pairs. Google tested the system by conducting side-by-side comparisons of sampled sentences from Wikipedia and news websites with the help of bilingual human raters. While GMNT is a huge leap forward, machine translation in general still suffers from notable errors that a human translator would never make, including dropping words and mistranslating proper names or rare terms, and translating sentences in isolation rather than considering the context of the paragraph or page. Until recently, neural networks were not even fast enough for real world deployment in products used by actual people. However, machine learning toolkit TensorFlow and Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) hardware made it possible for Google to begin using the new system. Both advancements provide enough computational power to deploy the GNMT models while meeting the stringent latency requirements of Google Translate. The Google Translate mobile and web apps are now using GNMT for 100% of machine translations from Chinese to English. Over the coming months, GNMT will be rolled out to the other 10,000 language pairs that Translate supports.

(Christie Hemm Klok/For The Washington Post) By Elizabeth Dwoskin September 27 Follow @lizzadwoskin PALO ALTO, Calif. — Jim Andrews is in a medical office wearing just a hospital gown, staring at his doctor of 11 years, who is staring back at him through the sleek, metallic lens of Google Glass. As the doctor examines Andrews, a new kind of medical scribe is watching the examination, transcribing everything he sees. The scribe, named Rahul, is thousands of miles away in India, and he is viewing the office visit live through the pint-size, WiFi-connected camera attached to the doctor’s glasses. “When was his last physical?” the doctor, Albert Chan, asks as he listens to Andrews’s breathing and checks his reflexes. Rahul’s nearly immediate answer pops up in a text bubble display in the right corner of the doctor’s field of vision. “June 3, 2014!” [What it was like to get examined by a doctor wearing Google Glass] The entrepreneurs behind the technology — which could one day morph into something as tiny as a contact lens — say it is more than a transcription tool: It’s the first step to supercharging doctors with instantaneous information that transforms how medical decisions are made. Instead of human scribes taking down notes, they envision a world in which artificial intelligence software could transcribe the office visit in real time, while immediately comparing the patient’s medical issues with those of millions of others, then making predictions about what treatments would work best. Moreover, they say the technology is bringing health-care professionals back into the moment with their patients — returning a sense of humanity that has been lost as computers have become a fixture in the doctor’s office. Darren Phelan discusses healthcare options with patient Lindsy Martin in Menlo Park, Calif. (Christie Hemm Klok/For The Washington Post) Yet, like much new digital technology in health care, Google Glass has the potential to create more problems than it solves. Medical scribing is a tough job that requires a high level of accuracy — note-takers in far-off lands need to know terms such as “eosinophilic esophagitis” — and getting a word wrong could have grave consequences. Health systems are also far more vulnerable to cyberattacks than other industries, such as banking, a gap that hackers have aggressively exploited in recent years, said Avi Rubin, director of the Health and Medical Security Lab at Johns Hopkins University. In recent years, hundreds of hospitals have been victims of ­“ransomware” attacks, in which outsiders block the hospital from accessing its own data until the hospital pays them money. Rubin said that hospitals are prime targets because of a “perfect storm” of weak security systems, the increasing digitization of data, and the fact that medical records can be so time-sensitive and critical to making life-or-death decisions. A live-streaming video of a patient exam with a doctor could be most sensitive of all. “You’re taking something that was in the doctor’s office and now you’re streaming it across the world,” Rubin said. “The whole health-care industry has lax security, and if you combine that with how private the information is and how it needs to be immediately available, that’s where I have concerns.” Google Glass is in part a response to the most recent major technology introduced into the doctor’s office. The switch to electronic health records has received billions in federal funding and been hailed as a major step forward for the medical field. Doctors now say they are turning to Google Glass so they can escape the burden of spending an entire patient visit — and several hours later in the day — typing information into forms. “I can look my patients in the eye again,” said Teresa Nauenberg, a primary care physician who works with Chan at the hospital Palo Alto Medical Foundation and has been using the technology for two years. Live-streaming visits Today, roughly 500 doctors in 27 states put on Google Glass. They wear them through the day, live-streaming their office visits to the virtual scribes, who look on and take detailed notes. Ian Shakil, the 32-year-old chief executive of Augmedix, the San Francisco start-up that has partnered with search-engine giant Google to distribute the technology, hopes that in the near future, seeing a doctor wear Google Glass will feel as normal as seeing one with a stethoscope. Augmedix has raised more than $36  million from venture capitalists and health systems, including Dignity and Sutter Health, which owns Palo Alto Medical Foundation. The start-up charges doctors between $1,500 and $4,000 a month for the service, which Sutter says saves doctors up to two hours a day. Scribes receive about three months of training from Augmedix before they can do the work, which is performed in sealed-off rooms. The company’s 200 scribes, divided between San Francisco and Bangalore, India, must leave pens, paper, smartphones and all other belongings at the door. For Shakil, accuracy is critical. Beyond extensive training of scribes, he says that doctors must ultimately review the notes to make sure all details were recorded accurately. If Augmedix is successful, it would also be a huge coup for Google, which has had a troubled history with Glass and health data. Glass emerged in 2012 as a pet project of Google co-founder Sergey Brin. Brin wanted to sell the $1,500-a-pair glasses as a high-end fashion item, and he went so far as to partner with designer Diane Von Furstenberg. But the product fell flat. Even in a society that is always recording, the glasses felt too much like a privacy violation — or a gimmicky party trick. Google discontinued its limited consumer sales last year and retooled the devices. (Snap, the company behind Snapchat, last week launched sunglasses with an embedded camera that can create 10-second videos.) Augmedix is now one of nine Google partners, which include start-ups using Glass to enhance museum tours, record surgeries and train workers doing equipment repair. In 2013, Google shuttered its personal health record platform, Google Health, because so few people were using it. Today, the search giant is competing with Amazon.com (whose chief executive, Jeffrey P. Bezos, owns The Washington Post), Microsoft and others for hospital customers to store data on its cloud servers. Many hospitals are wary of tech giants storing their data. Augmedix does not share any data with Google. Google declined to comment. Like many entrepreneurs, Augmedix’s founders say they believe in the Silicon Valley vision of better technology liberating people from older technology’s burdens. Yet in health, the record has not been so clear. Electronic medical records were supposed to make the medical system more efficient — reducing errors and enabling doctors to track a patient’s history. But their implementation has been rife with unintended consequences, said Robert Wachter, the interim chairman of the Department of Medicine at the University of California at San Francisco and the author of a 2015 book on the subject. A 2014 study by the American Medical Association and RAND Corporation found that digital records were a major contributor to physician dissatisfaction. Another article, in the journal Health Affairs, found that two-thirds of a primary care physician’s day was spent on clerical work. There’s also some evidence that electronic health records have increased the practice of overbilling Medicare by stuffing digital data fields with unnecessary procedural codes. “You see rates of physician burnout skyrocketing, and many blame it on the electronic record,” said Wachter. Augmedix’s solution could usher in unintended consequences of its own. The start-up takes extensive precautions in protecting data. The video, which is scrambled, is sent directly from Google Glass to the scribes. It doesn’t pass through hospital servers, which are often the vulnerable point that hackers exploit. The video is deleted after each medical visit. But the company is exploring ways to expand its business to make the video available to doctors who want to review it later. The latter is a riskier proposition, Rubin said. “Hackers look for the weakest link in the system.” Few patients seem concerned. “It’s a conflict, there’s no doubt about it,” Chan’s patient, Andrews, said of the privacy issues as he got ready to head back to work from his appointment. “How I’ve rationalized it is, if this can help my doctors provide me with better medical care at this stage of my life, I’m fine with it. If someone finds out I have an artificial knee, then so be it.” Andrews, who is 61, noted that Chan seemed “more relaxed” ever since he started wearing the device. Chan said that in his two years wearing Google Glass, only a small fraction of patients — 4 percent — have asked him to remove it. Many forget it’s even there, he said. Augmedix says that under 2 percent of patients ask their doctor to take off the lenses. Others doctors said they take their own measures to protect privacy — flipping the glasses over their foreheads, for example, when they are examining private parts. Stuart Peterson, senior partner with the venture capital firm Artis Ventures, said he felt uncomfortable after his visit. “You don’t know who is on the other side of it. It’s a scary thought,” he said. Low-cost scribes Augmedix’s capacity to become a wider solution to entrenched problems in the health-care system will depend, for now, on the start-up’s ability to find and train low-cost scribes. For decades, physicians have dictated their notes into tape recorders; paid transcriptionists converted them into written reports. Today, the growing use of medical records has created a demand for human scribes, who largely tag along full-time with doctors. Shakil has spent the better part of the past several years refining the training process; Augmedix’s San Francisco scribes — mostly 20-somethings looking to get start-up experience before medical school — are now trainers for people like Rahul. Like many start-up founders, Shakil is planning for a future in which the work done by humans is outsourced to machine. In recent years, artificial intelligence software such as Apple’s Siri have made big strides in understanding human speech. Medical transcription, however, presents far bigger challenges than asking Siri what the weather is. Still, he’s confident it will happen. “There’s not enough scribes in all of South Asia to serve the nearly million doctors here,” Shakil says. “Uber has driverless cars. One day, we’ll have scribe-less scribing.” business economy true Please provide a valid email address. Sign up You’re all set!

If you haven't read the article, I recommend you do, after which you'll likely get used to the idea of having 2FA on some of your accounts. Just yesterday I had to go into Google Authenticator for a code and when I logged into my GitHub account from my husband's laptop, I needed to enter the code I got by text. But there is another way, and it's a tiny FIDO U2F security key that I've now put on my keychain. The FIDO U2F Key is less than $20 on Amazon. The key came in a tiny envelope that at first I didn't even see in the Amazon box (it can't be more than 2 x 2 inches.) The key is ready as soon as you unbox it, but if you want to test it out you can use Yubico's website. The key I bought is the one on the far right. Next I plugged the key into my PC, it blinked a few times. I entered password/username and clicked next. Registration, done. Then I had to log out, log in on a different page and then touch the button/touchpad on the security key to complete authentication. Here's a little more about the FIDO U2F standard: U2F was created by Google and Yubico, with contribution from NXP, and is today hosted by the open-authentication industry consortium FIDO Alliance. U2F security keys are supported by Google Chrome since version 38 and Opera since version 40. U2F security keys can be used as an additional method of two-step verification for Google accounts, Dropbox, GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, Dashlane, Lastpass and the UK’s Government Digital Service. Dropbox Set up Two-Step Verification for your Dropbox account, if you haven't already. This is also where you will set up your mobile device as a backup in cases where you can't use the key. Here are the requirements to secure your Dropbox account with the Yubico key: Latest version of Google Chrome browser (or at least version 38) A YubiKey 4, YubiKey Nano, FIDO U2F Security Key, YubiKey NEO, or YubiKey NEO-n One finger (the YubiKey button is a capacitive sensor, not a biometric) A Dropbox account Once at Dropbox, navigate to your account settings and then Security. Click Security Keys, and then click Add. Enter your password, and click Next. Click Begin setup. Insert the key, wait a few seconds, and then click Key Inserted. When you see the message “Scanning for security key,” your key should start to flash. Wait for it to blink, and tap the button. All done! Hit Finish and move on with your day feeling a little more secure. Google Go to the Add a Security Key page section of My Account. Remove the key if it's already inserted. Click on the Register button. Insert your Security Key into a USB port on your computer. Completing registration varies slightly depending on the type of security key you have: Key with a button: After inserting, you should see a blinking light. Lightly tap the blinking circle. You’ll see a green checkmark to confirm registration. Key without a button: This Security Key turns off after each use. Please remove and reinsert the Security Key each time you need to use it. You’ll see a green checkmark to confirm registration. Click Done. When logging in from a new PC, you’ll be prompted to authenticate with the USB security key. Insert the key and press the button when you're asked (if there is a button.) Some devices and browsers (any browser but Chrome, actually) don't support security keys, so in those cases you can still use SMS verification or another two-step verification method you’ve configured in your Google account security settings. Github Login to Github, click your photo in the top right and go to Settings and then Security. Or just click this link to be taken to the security page. Enable 2FA if it isn’t already. Once 2FA is already enabled, click edit. Next scroll down to the bottom of the page where it says Security Keys and click Register New Device. Fill in a nickname, click Add, and insert the key into the USB port and tap its button. Then you’ll have the option of adding another key or deleting existing keys. U2F for Everyone Physical security keys, such as the Yubico FIDO U2F one I'm using, are still somewhat unknown and not yet a universal solution. For example, my key only works in connection with Google Chrome and requires a fully fledged PC (a device with a USB port), but don't underestimate FIDO U2F keys. The FIDO alliance is composed of several industry heavyweights, from financial institutions to technology and chip makers including the Alibaba Group, ARM, Bank of America, Discover, Google, Intel, ING, Lenovo, MasterCard, Microsoft, NTT DoCoMo, NXP Semiconductors, PayPal, Qualcomm, RSA, Samsung, Synaptics, USAA and Visa. It might be impossible to use your U2F key on a lot of websites today, but that's bound to change. As the industry moves forward FIDO (or FIDO 2.0 which includes Bluetooth and NFC implementations) along with mobile-style payments (Apple/Android pay using biometric authentication) will be shaping the future of e-commerce and online authentication. Update: Some of our readers have showed concern if you were to lose your Yubikey. One valid recommendation is to buy two Yubikeys, keeping the second as backup on a safe place. Note however that services that offer two-factor authentication using Yubikey also have recovery mechanisms so that you shouldn't be locked out completely if this were to happen. 12 comments 331 interactions Back to TechSpot Main Sections Technology News Reviews Features Product Finder Downloads Drivers Community TechSpot Forums Today's Posts Ask a Question News & Comments Useful Resources Best of the Best Must Reads Trending Now Hot Downloads About TechSpot About Advertising News Archive Social & Feeds Follow TechSpot Facebook Twitter Google Plus YouTube RSS Subscribe to the TechSpot Newsletter © 2016 TechSpot, Inc.

By Bob O'Donnell on Sep 27, 2016, 11:00 AM TechSpot Veteran fans of thriller author Michael Crichton may recall that his career kicked into high gear with the 1969 release of a novel entitled “The Andromeda Strain.” The book described the impact of a deadly microbe strain delivered to earth from space via a military satellite. Next week in San Francisco, Google is heavily rumored to announce the release of a new strain of operating system codenamed “Andromeda.” The new OS is expected to combine elements of Chrome with Android. Unlike current efforts to bring support for Android apps into Chrome, however, the new Andromeda OS is expected to bring some of the desktop-like capabilities of Chrome into Android to form a super OS that could work across smartphones, tablets, and notebook-style form factors. Though details remain sketchy, the new OS is expected to offer true multi-modal windowing, as well as a file system and other typical accoutrements for a desktop-style operating system. In essence, this means that Google’s next OS—expected to be released late this year or sometime next year—will be able to compete directly with Windows and macOS. On many levels, the development of a single Google OS is an obvious one. In fact, I (and many others) thought it was something they needed to do a long time ago. Despite that, its impact is bound to be profound, and cause a fair amount of stress and, yes, strain, for users, device makers and developers alike. For consumers and other end users, Andromeda will first appear as yet another OS option, because Google isn’t likely to immediately drop standalone versions of Android or Chrome OS after the announcement or release of Andromeda. Over time, as the transition to Andromeda is complete, those potential concerns will fade away, and consumers, in theory at least, should get a consistent experience across devices of all shapes and sizes. This would be a clear benefit for users, because they should have access to a single set of applications, consistent access to all their data, and all the other obvious benefits of combining two choices into one. At the same time, however, the transition could end up taking several years, which is bound to cause confusion and concern for end users. Trying to choose which devices and operating systems to use, particularly as device lifetimes lengthen, could prove to be frustrating. Plus, if Google does move away from Chrome, as some have suggested, existing Chromebooks become relatively useless. For device makers, Andromeda could represent an exciting new opportunity to sell new form factors, such as clamshell, convertible, or detachable notebooks running the new OS. They may also be able to create true “pocket computers” that come in a smartphone form factor, but offer support for desktop monitors and other peripherals, similar to Microsoft’s Continuum feature for Windows 10 Mobile. The launch of a new OS from a major industry player is always fraught with potential concerns, but the merger of two existing options (including the most widely used OS in the world) into a single new one heightens those concerns exponentially. Initially, however, Andromeda is going to be more of a challenge for device makers because of their need to deal with product categories like Chromebooks, that could potentially go away. Plus, like Microsoft, Google seems to be moving aggressively towards doing its own branded hardware products, and that takes away potential market opportunities for some of its partners. At the same time, the launch of a new OS with new capabilities and new hardware requirements seems like the perfect time for Google to make a serious play into their own branded devices. For developers, Andromeda will undoubtedly prove to be a strain for a longer period of time because of their likely need to rewrite or at least rework their applications to take full advantage of the new features and capabilities that will inevitably come with a new OS. Plus, any confusion that consumers face about which version of the different Google OS’s to use will negatively impact future app sales and, potentially, development. The launch of a new OS from a major industry player is always fraught with potential concerns, but the merger of two existing options (including the most widely used OS in the world) into a single new one heightens those concerns exponentially. As with Mr. Crichton’s book, the initial drama and tension are bound to be high, but eventually, I think we’ll see a positive ending.

One can connect to the internet for free now at stations like New Delhi, Patna Junction, Ernakulum Junction, Guwahati, Bhopal, Jhansi, Coimbatore and others. Google partnered with government's RailTel for this WiFi service. Google also announced a hotspot program called Google Station on Tuesday. Under this, network operators or universities, malls among others can pay and sign up with Google to set up and provide public WiFi. Google CEO Sundar Pichai had said at an India visit in January this year that its WiFi project aimed to cover 100 railway stations by 2016-end. "There are more than 3.5 million users on rail WiFi every month. Of these 15,000 every day are first-time users of the internet," said Caesar Sengupta, VP of "Next Billion Users" at Google. As for "Station", it is currently open for application for "large venues and organizations, network operators, fibre providers, system integrators and infrastructure companies" who can sign up on the Google Station website. Google rolled out a series of updates and products that are customised for slow networks with poor connectivity. Among the key new introductions was the YouTube Go app — the video sharing service's mobile app which they say is "inspired by India". It works on slow connections, plays a video preview that doesn't buffer, and lets you choose a lower resolution before you begin loading a video. Like the YouTube Offline feature launched earlier in 2014, here too, a user can download a video for later viewing. However, unlike the main YouTube app, the Go version has the ability to share directly from the app to "nearby" devices, and this won't require an internet connection. The new app, said Johanna Wright, vice president of product management at YouTube, was developed after studies and surveys with Indian users across 15 cities over a year. "It's not YouTube Lite, but an app custom-made for the Indian market," Neal Mohan of YouTube told TOI over phone.Google also announced data-scrimping updates to its browser Chrome, and its app store Google Play. Chrome already has a "data saver" mode which compresses images and text. Now the compression will work with videos too. Speaking to TOI, vice president of search at Google John Giannandrea said bandwidth was an important but not the only concern when it comes to India. "Part of the big excitement right now is what is going on in the 4G market in India...or the growth of WiFi. Being responsive to low bandwidth users is important if you want to grow in this market. But that isn't the only thing we're doing for the Indian market by a long shot," he said. Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.

EST September 27, 2016 Neal Buckles (Photo: Custom) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST ST. JOHNS COUNTY, Fla. -- Google contacted authorities when an email from Neal Buckles of Ponte Vedra looked suspicious, according to an arrest report obtained by First Coast News. Last week, Neal Buckles, 19, of Ponte Vedra was arrested in St. Johns County. He was charged with possessing and emailing two images of child pornography. According to his Facebook page and Linked-in account, he had a babysitting businesses and used to work as a child care provider at Church of Eleven22 in Jacksonville. The report says Google contacted the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, indicating a person with a particular I-P address - which was registered to the home where Buckles lived - uploaded two images believed to be child pornography to an Gmail address. Commander Chuck Mulligan with the St. Johns County Sheriff's Office said, "Anything with electronics today leaves a trail of electronic bread crumbs." It has been reported that Google scans emails for images of child pornography, but investigators do not want to tell the media how the process works "because providing too much of that information enables the criminals to get that much better at exploiting our children," Mulligan explained. In the case of Buckles, the arrest report states once Google contacted The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, that organization then passed the tip on to the St. Johns County Sheriff's Office. Mulligan said, "The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children will reach out to whatever agency is involved and begin working with them to send that information." You can also provide a Cyber tip via the website for the National Center for Missing and Exploted Children by clicking here. You can even report what kind of crime you think was committed, and that tip is passed on to the appropriate police department. Mulligan said investigators have Buckles' computer and they are searching it for any more possible criminal activity.  (© 2016 WTLV) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST JOIN THE CONVERSATION To find out more about Facebook commenting please read the Conversation Guidelines and FAQs Leave a Comment TRENDING VIDEOS Man offering truck for finding lost dog DR Horton homeowners come forward Search for missing 15-year-old girl Metro Diner violated federal wage regulations "We have got to stop the gun violence" Person of interest in custody after triple shooting Mannequin challenge starts on the First Coast Person of interest makes court appearance Businesses opening the door to applicants Top 5 Events Around the First Coast More Stories JSO investigating 'clandestine' incident Nov 18, 2016, 5:19 a.m. BUZZ: 12-year-old girl has no fear caring for her honey bees Nov 18, 2016, 7:47 a.m. How your students are really doing on their end of… Nov 17, 2016, 10:20 p.m. About Us Contact Us Reporters Index Help Connect With Us FCC Online Public Inspection File • EEO Public File Report Home National Politics Weather 7 Day Forecast Closings & Delays Radars Conditions Beach Cam Weather Alerts More...

For mobile gamers with an eye on their online privacy, questions over Pokémon Go's app permissions, how data is stored, and the background of the developer's CEO continue to cause concern... Read More and that Niantic was using an old version of Google’s shared sign-on service. They had never accessed more than your name and email address. Once a fix was rolled out, everyone moved on. Despite scaring everybody, it did make people pay attention to what data they give away when using social logins. What Are Social Logins? You’ve probably seen the buttons before. You’ve try to login to a website and are presented with a collection of buttons that say “Login with…” When you use one of those magical buttons, you login with an identity you have created on another site. This saves you from having to create yet another password for the new site. Ads by Google There are two standards that make it easy for your favorite websites to add social login: OAuth and OpenID. OAuth allows you to authorize apps and websites to access your data from another website, whereas OpenID allows you to identify yourself to an app or website. Google: What’s Connected? Google holds an incredibly large amount of personal data, especially if you use their integrated services on an Android phone. Rogue apps can be a huge danger here, so it’s vital you protect your primary account. After browsing the list of connected apps in Google’s Security settings, review what permissions an app has been granted.  You can then remove any unused or suspicious looking apps. Facebook: What’s Connected? Despite the widely held view that Facebook doesn’t value your privacy, they actually give you the most options. Facebook lists the apps connected to your account, and you can edit which permissions you grant, even after first connection. If you’ve been using Login With Facebook for a while then it’s a good idea to check that you are happy with the apps and the permissions they have. Twitter: What’s Connected? Twitter login is most widely used for publishing sites like Medium, where your real identity isn’t essential to the service. That doesn’t mean that you don’t expose a lot of information in your tweets 7 Fascinating Ways Researchers Are Using Social Media 7 Fascinating Ways Researchers Are Using Social Media Scientific researchers are flocking to social media as sites like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram are an opportunity to observe people interacting with each other and social phenomena in an online "natural environment".

Using social logins reduces the amount of passwords you have to remember, and may keep you more secure in the event of a data leak. Signing in with an OAuth provider awards an “access token” granting the app access to the approved information. This allows you to edit permissions when you login and potentially whenever you want in your account settings. What About Your Privacy? As the saying goes — if it’s free then you are the product. To get the speed and convenience of the improved login you do trade some amount of your data. Image Credit: Fatmawati Achmad Zaenuri via Shutterstock You should be aware that your provider will be tracking every site you use with their login. They won’t know what you do on that site, but they’ll know you were there. Before allowing access to your account it may be wise to check their Privacy Policy. These documents are tedious by design to persuade you to accept the terms. The accounts we use as login providers like Facebook and Google hold vast amounts of very personal data that you may not want exposed to a third party app. Check Permissions With MyPermissions The MyPermissions website is one of the easiest ways MyPermissions: Easily Clean Up Your Social Media Permissions MyPermissions: Easily Clean Up Your Social Media Permissions Read More to view the apps you have connected to your social accounts. You can also download their iOS or Android app to monitor the permissions that your apps request.

Opinion Anna Scantlin Contributing Editor | September 27, 2016 10 shares 5 4 0 1 0 0 0 0 0               Spreading through the media like wildfire, news of Snapchat’s latest invention, “Spectacles”, has sparked an incredible amount of interest. “Spectacles” are pair of glasses that can record 10 seconds of video on its 115-degree angle lens, which can then be directly uploaded to your Snapchat Memories via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi when you’re near your phone. The device appears to be loosely based on Google Glass, which produced plenty of hype on its own a few years ago, but ultimately failed. Are Snapchat’s Spectacles doomed to fail as well? Perhaps, but so far Snapchat's device has already tackled some of the more glaring issues with Google Glass. The first obstacle that Spectacles have overcome is pricing. Google Glass was priced at an exorbitant $1500, making it affordable to a very limited number of people. Despite the innovative nature of the device, the price was ultimately a deal-breaker for most. Spectacles, on the other hand, will be sold for a more reasonable price of $129.99 – more than less than 1/10 of the price of Google Glass. This price brings Spectacles within reach of a much larger audience. The second thing that Spectacles have over Glass is simplicity. Spectacles only do the one function – record 10-second (but up to 30-second) video snippets – whereas Google Glass was able to do that and more. Not only could Glass record longer lengths of video, but it could also conduct Google Searches, use Google Hangouts, view reminders, weather, dictate texts, and a whole lot more. It was essentially an emulator for the most important apps in your smartphone. So many extra features helped justify Glass’s higher price point, but $1500 was still a stretch for what most people would want to spend on a new technology, especially once you consider the obstacles experienced by early adopters of Google Glass. Not only were there concerns from non-Google Glass users about being recorded without consent or knowledge (Google Glass did eventually have a recording indicator light on the outside of the device, and Snapchat Spectacles do as well), but oftentimes authorities even got involved. One Glass “Explorer”, as early adopters were called, was removed from a movie theater for wearing his prescription strength Google Glasses, and then interrogated by federal agents based on suspicion of piracy. Another Explorer was pulled over and ticketed for wearing the device while driving, although the ticket was dismissed as there wasn't enough evidence to support that the device was on. Google Glass, as revolutionary as it was, just had too much going against it. Despite their similarities, I don't think that Snapchat’s Spectacles will be met with the same amount of condemnation. Will there be some? Absolutely. But overall, I think its limited, yet useful, functionality will be met with more praise than criticism. The chance of somebody recording 10-30 seconds of a movie constantly, or even quickly enough to record the entire movie, and furthermore stringing them together in order to sell pirated copies is extremely slim. Even while driving, the simple tap to record function could easily be dismissed as being about as distracting as changing the dial on your radio station (although it could still easily become a distraction if the driver intends record something irrelevant to their own driving). Overall, though, the usefulness of being able to record snippets of what users see through their eyes – which is about all this gadget can do – seems like a product people could learn to love. I think that Snapchat’s Spectacles have a good chance of working out decently, but there are still questions that need to be answered. We don't know what the quality of the camera is yet, whether they're waterproof or offer prescription lenses like Google did (they are sunglasses, however, so probably not if I had to guess) or whether people will even consider them “cool” enough to use or not. We'll find out soon enough, as the device is said to release sometime this fall in "limited quantities". Readers, what are your thoughts on Spectacles? Do you predict that it will be a hit or a flop?

Klint Finley Business Date of Publication: 09.27.16. 09.27.16 Time of Publication: 5:30 pm. 5:30 pm Google’s Got a Plan to Unify the World’s Wi-Fi Hotspots Google Public Wi-Fi is great. But it’s infuriating when your connection at the neighborhood coffee shop goes down minutes before deadline and the baristas have no clue what’s wrong. This frustrates the hell out of the coffee shop, too. It wants to offer secure, reliable service but usually lacks the expertise. That’s true of any business that offers free Wi-Fi, especially airports, hotels, and others that offer Wi-Fi on a huge scale. Google plans to fix this with Google Station, a suite of tools designed to make creating and maintaining public Wi-Fi a breeze. The company isn’t saying much beyond that, but it is working with unspecified Internet service providers and hardware companies to make it happen. Google is now enlisting partners like cafes and shopping malls. This goes beyond a set of recommended tools or preconfigured WiFi routers. Google will handle login info for the different hotspots. You’ll access the Internet from any of them using a single username and password—no more asking the barista for the network name and password. Google also promises to help Wi-Fi hosts to monetize their connections, the suggestion being that it will handle payments for anyone charging for access. Google–or rather its parent, Alphabet–already offers Internet connections through its high-speed Google Fiber, its mobile service Google Fi and its struggling effort to replace New York City payphones with Internet kiosks. Station differs in that piggybacks on the Internet service providers.

The new system, a deep learning model known as neural machine translation, effectively trains itself -- and reduces translation errors by up to 87%. When compared with Google's previous system, the neural machine translation system scores well with human reviewers. It was 58% more accurate at translating English into Chinese, and 87% more accurate at translating English into Spanish. As a result, the company is planning to slowly replace the system underlying all of its translation work -- one language at a time. The report adds: "The new method, reported today on the preprint server arXiv, uses a total of 16 processors to first transform words into a value known as a vector. What is a vector? 'We don't know exactly,' [Quoc Le, a Google research scientist in Mountain View, California, says.] But it represents how related one word is to every other word in the vast dictionary of training materials (2.5 billion sentence pairs for English and French; 500 million for English and Chinese). For example, 'dog' is more closely related to 'cat' than 'car,' and the name 'Barack Obama' is more closely related to 'Hillary Clinton' than the name for the country 'Vietnam.' The system uses vectors from the input language to come up with a list of possible translations that are ranked based on their probability of occurrence. Other features include a system of cross-checks that further increases accuracy and a special set of computations that speeds up processing time." business google internet ← You may like to read: → Microsoft Partners With Bank of America On Blockchain Trade Finance Donald Trump Wins US Presidency VC, Entrepreneur Says Basic Income Would Work Even If 90% People 'Smoked Pot' and Didn't Work Yelp Employee Posts Open Letter About Cost Of Living And Low Wages, Gets Fired Universal Basic Income Programs Arrive Russia Unveils 'Satan 2' Missile Powerful Enough To 'Wipe Out UK, France Or Texas' Submission: Google's new translation software powered by brainlike artificial intelligence OVH Hosting Suffers From Record 1Tbps DDoS Attack Driven By 150K Devices This discussion has been archived.

You can now register to vote, buy cigarettes in select states, and watch porn! Naturally, the ubiquitous website celebrated its birthday in true Google style: with a doodle. Google's doodles — say that five times fast — encapsulate the best parts of modern tech. Simultaneously silly and reverential, the artwork represents a marriage of creativity, culture, and technology. According to Google, the idea for the playful iterations of the Google logo originated at Burning Man. These days, on any given date, the website could be celebrating the birth of a little-known female science pioneer, the anniversary of a notable film, or even the first day of school. Today's doodle: an animated "G" folding a long, green balloon into the remaining letters of the word Google. Google notes that, though it is celebrating its birthday today, September 27, with a doodle, in the past, Google has celebrated its birthday on September 26, September 7, and September 8. Basically, it's been celebrating its birthday all month. (The Independent has investigated this fishy birthday situation, if you want more details about it.)

 YOUR E-MAIL VERIFICATION CODE Twitter With speculation mounting that Twitter Inc will soon have a new corporate owner, companies including Salesforce.com, Walt Disney and Google have shown interest in Twitter, which is evaluating its options The 10-year-old social networking service - which has long struggled to define its core purpose -may end up heading in one of several distinctly different directions depending on who ends up paying for it. Companies including Salesforce.com Inc, Walt Disney Co and Alphabet Inc's Google have shown interest in Twitter, which is working with investment banks to evaluate its options, according to people familiar with the matter. With Salesforce.com, Twitter might turn its focus to customer service communications and mining its database of tweets for business intelligence. Google would likely be most interested in the social and news dimensions of Twitter. Disney, by contrast, might see it as a way to expand the reach of its sports and entertainment programming. It is not clear how quickly Twitter might approach a sale, but it is moving to formalize the process, sources have said. A deal is by no means assured in light of the company's uncertain financial prospects and steep price tag - its market value is more than $16 billion after talk of a sale drove the stock up over the past few days. Twitter Chief Executive Jack Dorsey, speaking at a conference in Washington on Monday, declined to comment on possible sale talks. Salesforce.com, run by CEO Marc Benioff, is focused on cloud-based sales and marketing software; unlike Twitter, its main product is aimed at businesses users, not consumers. Under Salesforce.com, Twitter could become a corporate tool used to power sentiment analysis and nurture customer relationships. Salesforce.com already uses the Twitter "firehose" for its new artificial intelligence platform, Einstein. But many Twitter users - especially newer ones - are not active tweeters, which over time could limit the value of the data Twitter can provide. Salesforce.com could also likely gain much of the benefit of Twitter's data from licensing its trove of tweets as opposed to buying the whole company. Twitter would fit easily with Google's online advertising-driven business model. Ads could be sold across paid search, YouTube, display and mobile on Twitter - while filling a gap for Google, which has struggled with social media. Google, which has expertise in monitoring its video service YouTube, would know how to deal with the tricky policy issues facing Twitter, such as abusive tweets and censorship. Still, such a tie-up faces potentially fatal regulatory hurdles, analysts said. In Europe, where the company has a bigger share of the search market than in the United States, the company is already facing two antitrust investigations. Facebook Inc, meanwhile, has been trying to replicate Twitter on its own platform and could also face antitrust challenges if it tried to buy the company, Greenfield said. So far Facebook has not been mentioned as a potential buyer, but with its large cash reserves and penchant for surprise moves it cannot be counted out. Twitter's foray into live streaming of National Football League games and its presence in news gathering could interest media companies such as Disney, which owns sports channel ESPN. Twitter's presence on mobile devices could help any media company, all of which are struggling to find mobile growth, according to BTIG's Greenfield. No media company has a mobile product with as much reach as Twitter, he noted. "The world of media is shifting to mobile and these newer platforms are becoming the future," Greenfield said.

The mode would make it possible to only access private tabs through biometric authentication. So, if another person is using your phone or tablet you won’t have to worry about prying. Naturally, these searches will not be tied to Google accounts, but data will not be hidden from ISPs or Google itself. Related: Is this the new Google Pixel phone? The incognito mode is already available in the Chrome and Safari web browsers. In the updated iTunes listing Google wrote: “Search privately with incognito mode — Turn on “incognito mode” in settings and your search and browsing history will not be saved. You can also enable Touch ID for incognito mode, ensuring that only you can re-enter your existing incognito session if you exit the app. Pro tip: you can also enter incognito mode with a 3D Touch shortcut by hard pressing on the app icon.” Elsewhere Google has also added the ability to instantly play YouTube videos directly from search results without having to open the web browser or the app. Video: GoPro Hero 5, Hero 5 Session and Karma drone revealed 0 shares Read Comments Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus Free Newsletter Get TrustedReviews' award-winning reviews, opinions and advice delivered to your inbox for free!

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Mail Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple Pixel Phone Rumors: What to Expect from Google's Devices Philip Michaels Senior Editor Tech Media Network (Tom's Guide)October 3, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share Google is getting ready to take the wraps off its newest flagship phones, featuring new hardware, a different take on software and — potentially — an entirely new name. While past Google phones have carried the Nexus label, Google is expected to switch the name to Pixel for two new phones that will replace the Nexus 6P and 5X as the hardware that shows off what the Android operating system can do. Last year's Nexus flagshipsHere's a round-up of what we've heard about Google's phone plans in advance of their expected October unveiling. Last year's Nexus flagshipsMore * The new phones will be called the Pixel and Pixel XL. * They'll make their debut at an Oct. 4 press event, where Google's expected to show off other hardware, too. * Google will offer 5- and 5.5-inch versions of the phone, which will run Android Nougat and support the company's Daydream VR platform. * The phones will run on Qualcomm's Snapdragon 821 processor. Goodbye, Nexus; Hello, Pixel In September, Android Police broke the news that Google planned to drop the Nexus name from its lineup of smartphones. Instead, it's expected that the next flagship phones to come out of Google will be named the Pixel and Pixel XL. MORE: Here Are the 10 Best Smartphones Available It's unclear why Google is opting for this name change, though it might bring some naming consistency to Google's lineup of mobile devices. Last year, Google introduced the Pixel C convertible tablet during the same event where the Nexus 6P and 5X made their debuts. So putting tablets and smartphones under one brand name might make more sense from a marketing perspective. Mark Your Calendars for October 4 We can speculate on what Google might call its new phones, but it's very clear when they'll arrive. Google has announced an October 4 press event, and it's almost certain that the Pixel phones — if that turns out to be their name — will be center stage. The phones are unlikely to be the only hardware Google unveils at the event. Earlier this year, Google unveiled plans for a virtual reality platform called Daydream. It's a dead-certainty that the new Pixel phones are going to meet the hardware standards Google spelled out for its VR platform, and it seems likely that Google will show off the VR headset its developing as part of the Daydream project. Google is working on an Amazon Echo-like speaker called the Google Home, and we could get a glimpse of that device, too. And, if Google follows the format from its 2015 Nexus phone unveilings, it could show off updates to its Chromecast streaming device as well as more Pixel tablets. Read More MORE: What to Expect at Google's Oct. 4 Event Whatever Google has planned besides the Pixel phones, we'll be at the Oct. 4 event in San Francisco which starts at noon ET/9 a.m. PT. Here's What the Pixel Phone Looks Like Credit: VentureBeatMore Credit: VentureBeatVentureBeat offered up our first good look at the Pixel phone's new appearance with a leaked photo of what's likely to be the new device. The hardware itself looks like pretty standard stuff for a smartphone, but the photo shows off circular launcher icons and a Google icon in the upper left corner of the phone. Android Police has more on the new look for the icons as well as that Pixel Launcher. What About the Specs Details about the Pixel phones leaked out earlier this year when the devices were code-named Sailfish (the 5-inch phone) and Marlin (the 5.5-inch model). It's widely believed HTC will build the phones; that device maker handled the first Nexus One phone as well as the Nexus 9 tablet. Last year's Nexus 5X and 6P were produced by LG and Huawei, respectively. As noted above, both phones are almost certain to comply with the standards of Google's Daydream VR platform, since the entire point of Google creating phones is to showcase the capabilities of its software. That likely means Qualcomm's Snapdragon 821 will power both Pixel phones. The CPU has already shown up in fall flagships like Xiaomi's Mi 5s and Asus's ZenFone 3 Deluxe. Much of what we've heard about the new Pixel phones based on Android Police reports on the both the smaller Sailfish phone and the 5.5-inch Marlin device have been confirmed by Carphone Warehouse, a UK retailer that prematurely posted a Pixel phone specs page. In addition to confirming the presence of the SnapDragon 821 inside the new devices, the Carphone Warehouse post indicated the smaller Pixel will have a 1920 x 1080 AMOLED display while the 5.5-inch Pixel XL will feature 2560 x 1440 resolution. Both phones will start at 32GB of storage and feature 4GB of RAM. They'll have a 12-megapixel camera on the back, with an f/2.0 aperture and 1.55-micron pixels; an 8-MP shooter will be on the front of the Pixel and Pixel XL. Besides different screen sizes, the new phones will have different sized batteries — a 2,770-mAh battery will power the Pixel while the Pixel XL will offer a 3,450 mAh power pack. Credit: Carphone Warehouse via Android CentralMore Credit: Carphone Warehouse via Android CentralIf those are the Pixel's specs, that 5-inch phone will be an upgrade from the Nexus 5X in many areas, even if its screen is smaller than the 5X's 5.2-inch display. The Nexus 5X runs on a 1.8-GHz hexa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 808 processor with 2GB of RAM. The rear camera on the Nexus 5X is also 12-MP, but an 8-MP front camera would improve upon the 5-MP sensor on the current phone. The Pixel's resolution should be the same as the Nexus 5X, while its battery is only a slight uptick from the 2,700-mAh pack powering Google's current phone. Of course, with the Nexus 5X lasting 11 hours, 30 minutes on our battery tests, that shouldn't really be an area of concern. The Pixel XL's rumored specs have a lot in common with the 5.7-inch Nexus 6P. While HTC is shrinking the screen by 0.2 inches, the resolution will be the same, as will the camera specs. The Nexus 6P featured 3GB of RAM, so this new phone would ship with more memory. You could also buy a 64GB version of the 6P; the Pixel XL is expected to feature 32GB and 128GB versions. Most tellingly, the 3,450 mAh battery in Marlin would be the same that powered the Nexus 6P, though that's not a bad thing. The 6P lasted 12 hours, 25 minutes on our battery test, making it one of the longer-lasting phones we've seen. We're hopeful that the Pixel XL can continue that tradition. These phones are likely to cost you, if reports about pricing are true. Pricing is expected to start at $649, though it's unclear if that's for the smaller Pixel, as Android Police reports, or for the Pixel XL. If the former, that would match the pricing on Apple's iPhone 7. Other Changes When you get a Nexus phone these days, you're pretty much on your own for transferring contacts, adjusting preferences and otherwise setting up the device. A report from Android Police says that will change with the 2016 models, as Google is reportedly developing a support app that can put you in touch with customer service. The app will include screen-sharing capabilities so that customer support can better see what issue is causing you problems. As described by Android Police, the feature sounds an awful lot like the Mayday feature Amazon includes with its tablets and TV set-top boxes. And that would be a welcome addition that potentially opens up the Nexus phone beyond hardcore Android enthusiasts to casual users who might be put off by having to turn to online support documents for answers.

VentureBeat has an image of what it claims to be the Google Pixel, and says that a larger XL version will also be announced. Credit: VentureBeatMore Credit: VentureBeat The phone looks fairly conventional from the front, though you'll notice some changes from traditional Android devices. Notably, Google's icon in the top left-hand corner appears to have a mystery function, and the launcher icons are now all circular. Rumor has it that the Pixel will replace the Nexus line of phones. MORE: What to Expect from Google's Phones HTC is reportedly building the phone, and reports claimed the devices were code-named Sailfish (the smaller phone) and Marlin (the larger). In June, Android Police reported that the smaller device would have a 5-inch, 1080p AMOLED display, 4GB of RAM, 32GB of storage, 12-megapixel rear camera, 8-MP front camera and a USB-Type-C port. If you're wondering, Google's phone will have a headphone jack. A later report said the larger of the new phones -- expected to be called the Pixel XL -- will have a 5.5-inch, 2560 x 1440 display and a 128GB storage option. Both phones will have fingerprint readers on the back. VentureBeat says the phone will be on Verizon in the United States or unlocked from Google; it cites an Android Police report suggesting that the smaller phone will start at $649. We'll let you know the official news, specs and prices when Google makes its official announcement on Oct. 4.

In it, the poster in question claimed they had in their possession a BlackBerry Passport Silver Edition that had come pre-installed with Google’s Android mobile operating system. No less interesting, they were willing to part with a piece of BlackBerry history for a paltry $260. That post has since been taken down from Kijiji. After both CrackBerry and MobileSyrup, as well as several other websites, wrote about the listing, it’s likely the person who put up the listing got far more interest than they had bargained for when they made the initial decision to sell an unreleased device. In any case, the listing was more interesting as a look back at what could have been. For a lot of MobileSyrup readers, the Passport is emblematic of so many of BlackBerry’s strategic missteps in recent years. While it was not a commercial success, the Passport has its devout fans. Its 1:1 screen resolution and Hub functionality made the Passport unique and interesting, even as BB10’s weak app ecosystem ensured it was a non-starter for most consumers. So when rumours started filtering out of Waterloo partway through last year that BlackBerry was working on an Android-powered Passport, a lot of the company’s fans became excited; here finally was the device BlackBerry faithful had been asking for years. There was just one cause for concern: more often than not, the leaks that were coming out detailing the BlackBerry Passport Silver Edition conflicted one another. In some leaks, including one that came from Evan Blass, the device was codenamed Oslo and it was set to come with Android (like in the video above). In yet other leaks the exact same device was a BB10 smartphone called Dallas that BlackBerry planned to sell exclusively in markets outside of Canada and the U.S. Some leaks even used the two codenames interchangeably. Discuss. Further reading: http://t.co/eI0FFZu3Ng pic.twitter.com/zcydqV5ccV — Evan Blass (@evleaks) August 19, 2015 After speaking to multiple sources with direct knowledge of BlackBerry’s product roadmap at that time, MobileSyrup can now shed light on ‘Avengers,’ BlackBerry’s Android device development program. Part callback to the Marvel comic book and movie series, the codename was meant to encapsulate BlackBerry’s hopes for its first foray into Android: BB10 couldn’t be saved, but at least it could be avenged with the help of the world’s most popular mobile operating system. According to our sources, it’s likely that one of the first rumoured BlackBerry Android devices was known internally as Oslo. It is the device that appeared on Kijiji on Thursday and in numerous leaks leading up to the release of the Silver Edition we have today. It’s also exactly what it looks like: a re-purposed BlackBerry Passport running Android. That last fact is also part of the reason why Oslo was never released to the public. On page 35 of the most version of recent version of the Android Compatibility Certification Document (Android OEMs must adhere to the guidelines set out in this document if they want to release an Android device with access to any part of the Google Play Services ecosystem), Google states any non-Watch Android devices must either use a 4:3 or 16:9 screen aspect ratio. Oslo was intended to be BlackBerry’s first Android release, and BlackBerry and Google worked together to make core Google apps like Gmail and Chrome compatible with the Passport’s 1:1 aspect ratio. However, the amount of time and effort required to make Google Play Services work at such an unusual aspect ratio for essentially one device was deemed not worth it; the decision to scuttle Oslo was made by both BlackBerry and Google — though other factors also played a role, according to our sources. It’s unclear if BlackBerry started development Oslo and Dallas at the same time, though we can confirm that all ‘Avengers’ devices featured European codenames, while BB10 smartphones in development during this era instead used U.S. city codenames. Furthermore, what is clear is that the Avengers program continued in some form following the death of the Passport Silver Edition. The Priv, for example, what we know of today as BlackBerry’s first Android smartphone, was one of a number of devices on the company’s Android product development roadmap. It was known internally known as Venice at BlackBerry. During this same time period, BlackBerry was also working on an entry-level Android device codenamed Prague. While Prague may have informed parts of the outsourced DTEK50, BlackBerry’s second Android smartphone, they are two distinct devices; the DTEK50’s internal codename was Neon. We don’t know much about BlackBerry’s current future plans other than the fact the company is working on a device that could end up entering the market known as the DTEK60. For the time being, it appears the company has moved past the Avengers program; both the DTEK50’s codename and the fact that it was made by a third-party OEM suggest as much. Moreover, whether the Avengers program and the lineup of devices it produced were successful in their intended purpose is up for debate, though it’s likely that the project included many other devices that were either cancelled or outsourced. It’s also worth noting that BB10 innovations like the Hub live on in Android via the Hub+ app. However, with the company’s second quarter earnings fast approaching and BlackBerry CEO John Chen’s expected to make a decision on whether BlackBerry will stay in handset business, the Passport could quickly become one of the company’s final smartphones. Related: BlackBerry DTEK50 review: Pushing the security narrative ConcertMaster Not in the least surprised. You can’t build a device that is such a radical departure from where the focus is with apps today and expect it to succeed. Being able to view a spreadsheet on a square device might be appealing for some but not worth the expense to others. Put simply the device was useless Ann-Louise Winter I disagree. I have had the Passport SE since release (previously the original Passport) and love the wide display and keyboard. The display enables me to see more of the web page without having either to text wrap or scroll. The keyboard makes me a faster typist. Watching videos was a pleasure – the letterboxing was not an issue. I may buy another at today’s price so I have a new one available. ConcertMaster You realize you’re extinct breed right? Watching videos a pleasure? Is your TV at home also square! Ann-Louise Winter Perhaps extinct, perhaps not. Many people I know also love their Passports. The large screen means I don’t have to constantly turn it to get the best view. Taking pleasure in a device that works well for me is a good thing I hate to tell you. And the only thing I use the TV for at home is full-length movies that deserve a large screen. YouTube does not. Cheers. ConcertMaster YouTube doesn’t? That entirely depends what you’re watching on YouTube but square screens are ridiculous for nearly any multimedia content period Ann-Louise Winter The average YouTube video isn’t anything I want to be bothered putting on my TV screen. With letterboxing they become what the author uploaded. No issues for me and certainly not ridiculous. Of course he Passport like all devices is more than one thing. The things I love about it would make this reply a novel. It really is a fantastic device. Touch keyboard, large screen, BlackBerry Hub and interface, and on and on. If it were Android it would be more like the PRIV in its interface. If you like that then you’d prefer it that way. Chug that haterade Don’t waste your time trying to explain why the Passport is a great device to Trollmaster. The thing could have top notch specs, run millions of apps, and cure cancer and he would still have something snarky to say about it… Atlas The display would still be dumb. How do you read spreadsheets on it without Office? Chug that haterade Spreadsheets works fine on my Passport… Docs to Go is my primary app but there are others. Atlas No office then. Good look doing real work without. Chug that haterade Really? You gonna do vlookups on a phone? Gmafb Atlas No but basic editing is common. Chug that haterade Docs To Go does that…. sorry to disappoint Atlas I’m sure you excuse will always be “Who uses that?” Meanwhile I can begin editing a file on my phone then in one click switch to my computer to continue editing it, with the cursor at the same place. Chug that haterade Wow… you must want a cookie Patrick O’Rourke While I’m not a fan of the Passport, there is a vocal demographic out there that loves the device, that’s for sure! Meffaliss It is a neat device! Fun to toy with it! Atlas So your computer display at work is square?? lol Brian Trolling, par for the course ConcertMaster This company’s sad sack phones and stories like this equally par for the course UTB Brad So ConcertMaster’s sole purpose of a phone is watching movies? Well, there’s plenty of devices he can do that with. Sad he doesn’t realize other’s have different wants and needs. Some may need to be able to see documents correctly without juggling their phones this way and that. My most used app is my browser, and the square screen beats anything else out there. Wonder why ConcertMaster is so angry? Maybe he scratched his new Jet Black YouTube viewer? Chug that haterade His sole purpose in life is to troll BlackBerry articles… quite sad if you ask me. Chug that haterade Yet you continue to not only click on BlackBerry articles but bring up BlackBerry in articles not even related to them. Why are you so obsessed bro? Lazaridis use and abuse your mom? Chug that haterade ConcertMaster and his multiple names does nothing on this site but troll BlackBerry.. it is quite sad if you ask me. BrooklynTheFurry I would agree with Ann, passport is the best smartphone ever. Jesse Gilbert I’m with both of you on this one. I’m glad they took a gamble and made something different, I’ve never had a device more fitting to my needs. Atlas You are crazy. bigshynepo I know more people than I can count on one hand who use the Blackberry brand still. People who prefer communication/business to apps/games are obviously attracted to a keyboard. We may be a dying breed, but we sure are productive. You can’t imagine how much you can get done when you don’t spend 23.5 hours a day staring down into your phone, watching useless snapchats and scanning useless facebook timelines. jon Not having to rotate the device to watch a video is a great pleasure. And the speakers are second to none, literally the best phone speakers on the market. On top of that, a lot of media is still 4×3. More than you’d think. Being able to pre-load 10, 1-hour episodes of the JFK assassination documentary from the 90s for a train trip around Europe made the journey so painless. No internet connection required. It’s honestly the best media viewing device on the market if you ask me, especially YouTube. And the DAC is way better than Apple’s, and up there with the best. The phone also supports 24-bit FLAC and WAV. 16×9 is a little small, but I honestly prefer it to my iPhone. It’s still bright and 1440×1440 resolution. It’s just a great phone, and more people would love it if they tried it. Tony Cheung I totally agree on this. Watching a short YouTube video isn’t bad at all and you can use the extra screen for video control…etc. The 1:1 screen ratio is all arounded and it’s especially good for a qwerty. I wonder if BlackBerry can adapt it to a 4:3 ratio if that all it takes to get Google certification. Halfey Halphstein I would seriously consider getting it if BB adopted a 4:3 ratio display to enable Android on Passport. Even better if they could populate the freed space with Classic buttons including the optical trackpad, though I’m not sure how well Android plays with nav button these days. Oh wait! I think the Classic buttons can’t be done if they wanted to pick the Android route because AFAIK another requirement for Android hardware is the 3-button setup. I mean it should be technically possible but Google won’t give their blessing. So the only possible ‘solution’ for an Android-powered Passport would be a 4:3 ratio display and (optional) Android buttons at the bottom of the display, just above the keyboard. Atlas Watching a video on normal phones isn’t just “not bad”, it’s actually good. Tony Cheung I should say it’s actually good because you also have the video controls on the screen. Plus you do not have to rotate the screen to landscape for video and then back to portrait. In real life, I saw most people watch YouTube videos in portrait mode on their normal phones. Atlas Having the controls always on is distracting. Rev0lver What took you so long? This was posted for at least 10 minutes before you commented. Talk to you later friend. Chug that haterade He was busy trolling the two other BlackBerry articles posted today like an obsessed stalker… Sweet The Passport is an awesome phone, especially the SE version. It’s a real powerhouse. The best phone on the market, IMO. But I’m not sure it would sell well if it ran Android, since lack of apps wasn’t what limited its sales. I sure as heck wouldn’t buy it. BTW, a 1:1 screen is better for photos, since it’s closer than to the 4:3 ratio of camera sensors than 16:9. When you take a 16:9 photo or video, the camera captures in 4:3 and the software crops the top and bottom to make it 16:9. ConcertMaster “The best phone on the market…” LOL! yeah okay whatever pal. You really are delusional. Brian Trolling, as usual ConcertMaster This is a bullshît story anyways. I mean it’s only purpose is to feed the fantasies of fanboys who salivate over stuff like this. Who really cares why they never released the Passport as an Android. The whole experiment is 4 years too late UTB Brad And yet you’re commenting more than the so-called fanboys. Here. Have a napkin. Chug that haterade “Who really cares why they never released the Passport as an Android” you.. obviously. Why else would someone click on the article if they weren’t interested? Oh wait, most people have lives and aren’t obsessed stalkers.. Brian Stock From one Brian to another, I’ve blocked this user and I suggest you do the same. I’m not even sure who it is anymore, but your comment is reassuring me that I did the right thing. Ann-Louise Winter Agree with you. I’m hard-pressed to find a better one. Tony Cheung Oh yeah. You are totally right. Aren’t most instagram photos 1:1? They are 100% full screen on my Passpor. kph Great article, very informative. Makes sense why they haven’t released a square device and why the unreleased Mercury has an elongated display. If you haven’t used a Passport, you can’t knock it. It’s a fantastic design for power users that use a phone for work and communications. BB10 as an OS is perfect in every way other than having access to Google Play Services. Some people need their phones for actual communication and this is the best phone and OS to get stuff done. Period. If they made the Android Passport work, it would do about as well as the current Passport, so not great, but those who use it would love it. It’s a shame it didn’t work out because it could have been a really cool and different Android device. The Priv is too, but the Passport would have been in a league of its own. Hopefully the Mercury can fill this gap. Bruce Banner Might also be worth noting a passport running android wasn’t ready for release. It takes time for a company like BlackBerry to bring its strengths to android. The priv was buggy enough upon its release. It’s fantastic now, especially after the last hub, camera and marshmallow update. Imagine if they released it 12 months earlier. It would have been unusable. Own a passport and a priv. Both great phones. Last android hub update with html auto signatures, custom popup and normal widgets/hub shortcuts has almost eliminated my need for a bb10 device. Android really just needs a good browser, file manager and better user interface now. xBURK Great read. Thank you. I’m loving the PRIV now but do miss the passport for sure. Definitely would have tried one out with Android. RS Great article. A little disappointing though. I’ve come to terms with the fact that we won’t see a 1:1 screen but have been hoping for something large, wide and not so tall for awhile. I guess we’re stuck with 16:9 until the end of time. dolsh Can confirm. It’s not really new news…it was fairly well known to be the case back when a select few were wandering around Waterloo with pre-release privs over heating in their pockets. onstrike112 I would’ve liked to see a Passport on Android. They should have just run the apps pillarboxed for 4:3. They do that on BlackBerry 10. Pingback: なぜブラックベリーは決して Android 搭載パスポートを発売 | スマホHack！() Noni If you had ever used a Passport for sometime then I guess your perception would have been completely different. You say limited utilitarian value?? It is one of the most productive device unlike all those fancy phones out there…. ConcertMaster It’s dead buddy and the company just confirmed it this morning Atlas This comment proves fanberries are nuts. JD Blackberry should have conceded earlier and worked with Google to release a Canadian version of a Nexus Device that Google does yearly except with an emphasis on high security. That would have benefited them both. Alas their own hubris killed them. Good night POS prince. Brad Fortin “Google states any non-Watch Android devices must either use a 4:3 or 16:9 screen resolution” Oh, Google. So “open”, placing such arbitrary restrictions on the walled garden that is Google Play Services. Talk about stifling innovation. fred You’d be the first to complain against the “fragmentation” if Google allowed a 1:1 ratio. It may be a walled garden, but they are giving the user the key (allow apps from non-trusted sources such as the Amazon app store) Brad Fortin Google Play Services is the kind of walled garden to which OEMs are only granted the key if they follow a strict set of guidelines. Allowing access to apps from non-trusted sources is part of the AOSP, not Google’s Play Services walled garden. fred Part of AOSP or not, it’s there on every phone with Google Play services. Save a few shameful exceptions such as a few AT&T phones in the US. If they set a guideline to disallow it, I’d be the first one to complain. Caspan I was going to say the same thing, more innovation stifled because you are at the mercy of another company. This really pissed me off!! Google stop putting such reductions restrictions on your stupid OS ConcertMaster Why should Google or any software company developing apps have to cater to a stupid company like Blackberry making odd-shaped phones with useless aspect ratios? You think these people should bend over backwards to satisfy the fantasies of users of one particular phone like the Passport? lol! Caspan Your batting a 1000 today lol, it has nothing to do with BlackBerry it has to do with a hardware manufacture that can’t do things because they are held back by the OS they put on it. When you control both OS and hardware like Apple and BlackBerry you have no one telling you what to do. Go to bed because you clearly have no idea how to read! ConcertMaster No. it has to do with the ridiculous notion an app developer should be compelled to make applications for an OS with practically zero market penetration. As a developer would you waste your time? I sincerely doubt it. Had they made an effort to court development of apps for BB10 and not fumbled releasing it so late we could be having a different conversation Caspan Let me spell it out for you again since you suck at reading. It sucks being at the mercy of a different company when making hardware for anyone. This has nothing to do with BlackBerry! Man you just breath stupid don’t you!! Atlas You’ve got it all backwards. Google isn’t going to support idiotic screen ratios just to please a few weirdos. That would add them a lot of work for basically nothing since all of you BB fanboys are now finally almost extinct. Caspan No I said it exact right, it sucks being at the mercy of someone else who gets to control what hardware you use! Look at windows, there is no screen restriction you can use any monitor you want. This again has nothing to do with BlackBerry but has to deal with Android. I get that they have to set a limit on a small screen it’s hard to make apps look nice and with the fragmentation Android already deals with. I get it I really do it just sucks being at someone else mercy is all I am saying. If for some reason a 6:1 screen is found to be an awesome screen resolution your now have to prove it to the software vendor before you can try it. Atlas I understand. The thing is that a majority of customers have chosen that they don’t want a square display. Caspan True, but the OS that was running on it could be the reason for that 🙂 Chug that haterade So just because the majority of consumers don’t want a square screen means it is a terrible product? So because I don’t want a Prius, should Toyota stop making them? Smh Atlas Millions of people want a Prius. Chug that haterade So…. I dont…so Toyota should stop making them. And BlackBerry sold 400k phones last quarter and around 500k the quarter before that so people want them. Granted, they don’t have sales numbers like Apple or Samsung… but Tesla also doesn’t have the sales numbers as Ford… does that mean their products are inferior? Atlas Tesla also has great reviews. BB won’t be making phones itself anymore. Their phones are walking into oblivion. Chug that haterade Well, if you look at customer reviews for BlackBerry devices… ie the Passport… they score very good. Atlas Maybe if BB hadn’t so utterly failed they would still have their own OS. Caspan Maybe, maybe people just didn’t want another OS to program for. Dev’s are lazy and the less you have to do the more you make 🙂 fruvous I wonder if there will be some intrepid souls who will figure out how to root and load Android on BB10 devices. Hayden James I have a Passport, soon 2, the other I will probably keep unopened and call it the best Blackberry every made, (yes the Passport). And it would have been Amazing with Android for the millions of BB users who left BB for Android but missed the physical keys, without being cramped or slide out. I knew about this end-of-an-Era and so purchased a BB10 passport off amazon a few weeks ago and another for $299 from shop.blackberry just Sunday night. The Passport with Android should have been focused on more than many of the other projects. Blackberry’s Achilles heal, starting with the launch of the BB Storm has been that they are not self-aware of their strengths and what their customer base or the market want and crave from them. Such an innovative company who seems to constantly push the wrong hand and basically hide the best hands repeatedly. Then there’s iPhone… who if you simplify it are basically still selling the same rectangles just in different sizes and colors. ha Fully aware of their base and strengths. Atlas Ridiculous. The company that was still selling the same phones was blackberry. Apple has changed the world with the iPhone. The iPhone keeps on getting better and better while BB still tries to catch up with features from 10 years ago. Chug that haterade Really? You are a typical delusional iFan. Gestures? Stickers? Both things Apple copied from BlackBerry Atlas BB nor Apple invented stickers or gestures. Chug that haterade BBRY had both long before Apple.. so what were you saying about “BlackBerry playing catch up to Apple in features”? Atlas That’s it’s probably not as well implemented. Chug that haterade That is extremely subjective… I’d argue that BB10 gestures are far superior to iOS…and I use my iPad Mini fairly often. Troy Dobranski Blackberry made their bed as soon as BB10 rolled out. I am a techno freak. I regularly go out and try different devices to learn new things about it. I bought a Nokia 520 just to try windows mobile out for a few weeks. That being said, most devices you pick up and start using have a similar experience and a basic knowledge across platforms for how things work. You cannot pick up a BB10 device and just start using it. You have to change all your habits and learn gestures you don’t use on any other device. BB os users of old hated the new BB10, and that was Blackberry’s first nail in the coffin. Secondly, the new generation is so app oriented. Blackberry did not have the developer interest it needed to keep up with social media and multimedia apps and services that most handset’s main demographic were interested in. Blackberry’s customer base appeals to such a narrow margin of what buyers are looking for. 2nd Nail in the coffin Thirdly, Business users have so much more choice out there for Enterprise services. I had our IT guy name so many others that he is selling to customers that offer more flexibility and strengths past only being secure. Mix that with a lot of major companies going to a bring your own device strategy and now you’ve left the average consumer the decision of the phone, which as pointed out before is going to be someone more app oriented if it’s also their personal phone. Third nail in the coffin. The Passport is a great device that meets such a small margin of consumers. It was the phone everyone wanted 10 years ago. There are still some people that prefer the screen and keyboard. I used to as well. When I was forced to switch to full touch screen I loved it and now wouldn’t give up the screen real estate to go back to an actual keyboard. I think a lot of people who forced themselves to switch feel that way. Those that didn’t bought a Priv. Too bad you can’t find a rugged case for it. Too little too late Blackberry. You’re done. Their patents are what make them worth anything at the moment. All my old die hard blackberry friends have switched. Every single one. I predicted this back in 2011, and here you are. ConcertMaster All very true but you still have people clinging to the fantasy the company is alive and well and should make more BB10 handsets or a dual BB10/Android handset along with more keyboards. The degree of denial is frankly appalling and this against the backdrop of more losses and further declines in revenue for 5 years straight now. Meanwhile Chen talks about ‘pivoting’ and ‘inflection points’ while the company edges closer to Chapter 11 and his cronies from Pyramid and Sybase come over to cash out before it does. Truly sickening. Caspan It has nothing to do with denial it has everything to do with people that have hardware that is truely amazing and to keep that hardware it has to have a current OS. I just think you are in denial that BlackBerry made some of the best damn hardware out there! If no one pushes the boundary no one would be fired to innovate. You would rather another boring flat rectangle, yeah that seems exciting. Do what everyone else is doing, how original and exciting. Look we rounded the corners of the phone!!! Ohhhh, ahhhh BlackBerry was the only company that was not scared to actually innovate! ConcertMaster Amazing? lol! Says who? The sales numbers for this device don’t reflect that and your opinion doesn’t make it so. People are generally happy with ‘rectangular’ phones and there isn’t much room to design something more complex than that. The Passport didn’t go over well because it constantly required two hand usage and near gorilla hands if you tried anything less. Sure it was a unique concept worth a try but really it was too radical a departure and there is no market for odd-shaped phones just because they aren’t a rectangular slab. Caspan Build quality stupid it has nothing to do with sales. Best built devices ever because there were engineered and designed in Canada. Not this crap they push out of China as cheap as possible everyone you drop it it breaks. ConcertMaster They made a lot of crap. All this company ever pumped out was the iteration of the same keyboards often with the same internals. They were worse than Apple in that regard which is a frequent criticism BB fanbois toss around about the iPhone. Nothing innovative or interesting came out of this company after 2005. Chug that haterade Yet you’re on BlackBerry articles nonstop. Yeah, a trackpad keyboard isn’t innovative in the least… but making a bigger iPhone definitely is. Smh Chug that haterade 1. Sales numbers aren’t a determinant of quality. I’ve seen plenty of garbage that sells well… it is called marketing. Look it up. 2. So BlackBerry tried something different… shoot them for trying. Sheesh… they should push out 10 different 5 inch rectangular touch slabs a year like everyone else… 3. I can use my Passport SE one handed… it is definitely easier to type with both hands… but you don’t need “gorilla hands” to use it. Atlas Blackberry hasn’t innovated in years. Chug that haterade Really? Because a trackpad like keyboard isn’t innovative? Lemme guess… a bigger iPhone and removing the headphone jack are your ideas of innovation. Atlas Yes, I’d say the trackpad thing is innovative. Chug that haterade But you just said BlackBerry hasn’t innovated in years? Atlas I was wrong, you gave one good example. Chug that haterade Props to you. I respect someone that will admit when they are wrong.. 🙂 Lil’ Cwyin’ PC Fanboi Innovation takes courage…geddit?!? Atlas Yes, like removing old tech such as the keyboard. Lil’ Cwyin’ PC Fanboi Bingo. Foobar Funny enough, I used the google play store for a very long time on my Passport SE and never had issues with the 1:1 display. fred It may work. Google just don’t want to give you any warranty. fred I’m glad google rejected the 1:1 ratio. Chug that haterade Why? fred because it brings nothing useful and there is already the 4:3 ratio which is close enough. We don’t need hundreds of different ratios which only makes it harder for software developers Chug that haterade So adjusting a screen ratio is hard for developers? How about creating apps for multiple versions of Android? fred Not that it is hard, but it is an effort. A useless one. Not worth it just for Blackberry. Cornfed710 Aspect ratio not resolution, is what you meant I believe. 4:3 and 16:9 is not a resolution. Igor Bonifacic Fixed, thanks! Brad Fortin Even if BlackBerry had released an Android-powered Passport it’s running a Snapdragon 801, which means it wouldn’t get Nougat. BBRYSUXBALLS_2.1 Can they do anything right?? Chug that haterade Can you? BBRYSUXBALLS_2.1 I don’t work for BrokeBerry Chug that haterade You don’t have a job period.. Lil’ Cwyin’ PC Fanboi Seemingly not, alas… Haseeb Khan Forget The Passport… I wish they could make a new Blackberry Priv “2” With a Keyboard like the classic, 2 front facing speakers, Snapdragon 823, Bigger Battery & Well Worth The Price Unlocked!!! Agree? Correct me if I’m wrong , thanks ! Atlas Specs aren’t everything. A good ecosystem is primordial. Atlas Why do people buy blackberry phones nowadays? Caspan As in BlackBerry OS phones or BlackBerry hardware. I personally love their hardware, it has been second to non for build quality, we’ll it was but now it’s on to China crap with crappy build quality and exploding batteries!! Yeah!!! As for the BlackBerry OS I would agree not much use for it now! Chug that haterade Why not? Passport SE is the best device I’ve used.. Atlas You should try other phones. Chug that haterade I have… iPhone, Galaxy… decent phones but Passport SE meets my needs.. Atlas That’s what counts indeed. Chug that haterade Exactly… that is why I don’t get the hate on here. If an iPhone meets your needs but a BlackBerry doesn’t.. great… get an iPhone and enjoy it. Some people bash others for their choice of device and it is annoying… Atlas I understand. That was not my intention. Chug that haterade Fair enough… in reading some of your comments, they sorta come off that way… but it is what it is. I get that people are passionate on both sides of the coin. At least you are willing to have intellectual discourse… there are a few here that only show up to flood the comment section with abject hate. Lil’ Cwyin’ PC Fanboi I recall you…er…bashing Apple on a regular basis. Chug that haterade Just giving you Apple fanbois trolling BlackBerry a nice dose of your own medicine. Lil’ Cwyin’ PC Fanboi B’Oh! Lil’ Cwyin’ PC Fanboi SE? Oh! You mean the Apple 5 SE. Chug that haterade Naaaw… I wouldn’t but that pile of garbage with your money Lil’ Cwyin’ PC Fanboi Garbage? It’s a great fone in a small form factor. A9 processor, Uncky Pwessed…beat that. Chug that haterade No thanks… Atlas No no. BB is still selling the same thing 16 years later while Apple has changed how phone cameras work with the dual camera, how security works with touchID, how payment work with Apple Pay, how UI interaction works with Force Touch, how phone response works with Taptic Engine… That is all innovation. Saying that it’s the same thing is absurd. Chug that haterade Hahahahahahaa. Yeah..okay. If the iPhone is so great (as you claim), why are you here? Atlas Because you people are funny. You are the same ones who believed that BB would destroy Apple 6 years ago. Chug that haterade So I claimed BBRY would destroy Apple 6 years ago? Since when? Do you have proof of me saying that? Atlas blogs DOT blackberry DOT com/2010/10/rim-responds-to-apples-distortion-field/ Chug that haterade So BlackBerry posted that.. who cares? Steve Jobs said some dumb stuff too.. like how he claimed that 7 inch tablets were DOA… and then Apple turns around and makes an iPad Mini? Atlas Yeah, but some people in those comments are in this thread. I found that funny. Chug that haterade Maybe… there are knucklehead fans for every platform Samantha Jones The passport is the without a doubt the best phone I’ve ever used. It HURTS that I traveled a lifetime to find this perfect machine only for it to be taken so swiftly away from me. Please, bring back the Passport!

This change will come into effect after January 10, 2017. Google’s definition of an intrusive interstitial is one where the main content on a page cannot be read due to interstitial covering up the entire screen. Landing on these types of pages is frustrating for users, Google says, because the pages are not immediately displaying the content users expect to see. “Pages that show intrusive interstitials provide a poorer experience to users than other pages where content is immediately accessible.” Specifically, Google will be targeting pages with interstitials that are displayed either when the user immediately lands on the page, or those which pop up while a user is scrolling through the page. In addition, Google will also target pages where the above-the-fold content is designed to look like an interstitial, with the main content being displayed underneath the fold. Pages with banners that use a “reasonable” amount of screen space will not be affected by this change. Pages that are forced to use interstitials in response to a legal obligation, either for cookie usage or age verification, will also not be affected by this change. If this algorithm change sounds familiar, it’s because Google previously had a signal that devalued pages with interstitials that prompt users to install a mobile app. After further development efforts, Google says it became clear that there was a need to target interstitials more generally. Google reminds that this new signal is only one of the hundreds used to rank content. If Google determines that the main content of a page is highly relevant to what a searcher is looking for, pages with intrusive interstitials may still be served in search results.

Google Releases Two Chrome Extensions for XSS Discovery and Mitigation GO Google says it paid over $1.2 million just for XSS bugs Sep 27, 2016 20:30 GMT  ·  By Catalin Cimpanu  ·  Share:  Google released two new tools called CSP Evaluator and CSP Mitigator that help security researchers identify weaknesses that are often exploited to launch XSS attacks. Both tools revolve around CSP, or Content Security Policy, a security mechanism implemented by all major browsers, albeit in a different manner. CSP is a set of rules that allow developers to restrict which scripts can execute inside a page, so when attackers find a way to inject HTML code into a vulnerable application, they won't be able to load malicious scripts and other types of resources, because CSP strictly prohibits and blocks those payloads at the browser level. 95% of all websites deploy incorrect CSP rules Despite the advantages of this security mechanism, Google says that 95 percent of one billion domains it scanned during a recent study deployed improper CSP policies that allowed attackers to bypass CSP protections and load scripts to launch XSS (cross-site scripting) attacks. With the launch of CSP Evaluator, in the form of a self-standing website scanner and Chrome extension, Google hopes that webmasters would be able to test their CSP policies and improve their website's anti-XSS protection features. Google also recommends that webmasters look into nonce-based CSP policies. Nonces, which is a term to describe random, one-time, and temporary tokens, are a safe method of deploying CSP policies that can't be bypassed. Two Chrome extensions are available To help developers look into implementing nonce-based CSP policies on their websites and inside their web applications, Google has released a second Chrome extension called CSP Mitigator. Google says this second extension is capable of identifying scripts that do not have the correct nonce attribute. Additionally, it can also detect inline event handlers, "javascript:" URIs, and several other problematic details. Moreover, according to the company, both extensions have been used internally in setting up CSP policies for various Google services, such as the Google Cloud Console, Google Photos, Google MyAccount History, Google Careers Search, Google Maps Timeline, and Google's Cultural Institute. After admitting to paying over $1.2 million just for XSS bugs via its internal bug bounty program, Google is now pro-actively trying to fix "the XSS problem" that plagues almost all of today's websites.

  Subscribe! | Login | Search Waze to Deploy Bluvision's Directional-Beam Beacons Google's social navigation service will employ Bluvision's new BEEKS Plus LR beacons, which offer a longer range and battery life, to pinpoint the locations of Waze users as they drive through tunnels and under bridges. By Claire Swedberg Tags: Asset Tracking PDFEmailPrintDefinitionsSave Article Sep 27, 2016— Waze, Google's social navigation app and website, has begun using Bluvision's new BEEKS Plus LR ( Long Range) directional-beam antenna beacons for wayfinding in tunnels and under bridges around the world. Waze has already installed Bluvision's customized non-directional BEEKS beacons in sections of underground or covered highway in Pittsburgh, as well as in Haifa, Israel. Waze is currently in the process of installing the beacons in Paris and Rio de Janeiro. As Waze does so, it will use the new BEEKS Plus LR beacon, which offers a long battery life and longer read range by focusing its 2.4 GHz signals directly in front of or behind itself. Commuters worldwide use Waze to share and access crowdsourced traffic and navigation information. The Waze app utilizes a smartphone's GPS data to identify a user's location when content is sent, and to deliver traffic information to that phone. However, GPS does not work when a phone is underground or under structures that could block satellite signals, such as tunnels and covered parking areas. In such areas, therefore, users could experience blackouts (known as tunnel-blindness). For the past six months, Waze has been using a customized version of the BEEKS Plus beacon that offers a faster ping rate, in order to obtain fewer errors for applications involving fast-moving vehicles, as well as a stronger signal. To get around this problem, Waze has installed Bluetooth beacons at locations where GPS signals are blocked. The company worked with Bluvision to customize its BEEKS Plus beacons so that they would function with applications involving moving vehicles and solve historic, tunnel-specific location challenges. Tweaks included supporting a faster rate of beacon pings to result in fewer errors for situations involving fast-moving vehicles, and a stronger RF signal to provide sufficient overlap of beacons' coverage. Additionally, the beacons' adhesive and mounting properties were customized and tested for their ability to withstand such activities as tunnel wall cleaning by heavy-duty machinery. Waze piloted the customized version of the BEEKS Plus beacon in Haifa approximately six months ago, says Jimmy Buchheim, Bluvision's CEO. Now, the company is using the beacons permanently in Pittsburgh and Haifa. For those installations, Bluvision mounted the customized BEEKS Plus beacons on tunnel walls in such a way that they can withstand the cleaning brushes and scraping equipment used by highway agencies, according to John Sailer, Bluvision's COO. To date, Waze has deployed more than 1,000 customized non-directional BEEKS Plus beacons. (Google did not respond to a request for comments.) Jimmy Buchheim, Bluvision's CEO This year, Bluvision developed an antenna that lets a beacon focus its RF signal rather than simply emit a blanket transmission surrounding the beacon on all sides. This antenna has been incorporated into the new BEEKS Plus LR, enabling the beacon to transmit a directional beam in two polarizations—vertical and horizontal. The BEEKS Plus LR has a built-in reflector that a deploying company can adjust electronically and remotely in order to direct its beam to a specific area. Waze has now started to deploy the BEEKS Plus LR beacons in Paris and Rio de Janeiro, and plans to eventually install them at other locations worldwide. By deploying these beacons, Waze can reduce the amount of power required to achieve the necessary transmission range, thereby extending the battery life to 10 years or more. Alternatively, it can extend the transmission range to a radius exceeding 0.6 mile without increasing power consumption. Not only can the BEEKS Plus LR beacon offer a long range and low power needs, but a phone or tablet can also pinpoint its own position relative to the beacon, based on the strength of the BLE signal received by the phone. That information can then be used to provide phone and tablet users with location-based notifications, according to a precise location.

By Ben Rosen, Staff September 27, 2016 Save for later Saved Voters cast their ballots in the Illinois primary in Hinsdale, Ill., March 18, 2014. As various social media platforms push for voter registration, some states say they are seeing record registration rates. M. Spencer Green/AP/File View Caption About video ads View Caption of Facebook, SnapChat, and Twitter are rocking voter registration. The social media networks are part of a national voter registration campaign that has seen records set in numerous states since Facebook first started to nudge its users on Friday. “Going back to 2008, we’ve been reminding people on Facebook to vote on Election Day and directing them to information on where to vote,” said Samidh Chakrabarti, who manages civic engagement products for Facebook. “ This is the natural next step.” Recommended: How is money reshaping American politics? Take our quiz. And what a next step it’s been. Georgia’s online voter registration system, for instance, recorded a 2,500 percent increase in the number of requests it received over the same day last year. As results continue to come in from different states, #NationalVoterRegistrationDay has shown web and social media platforms are a powerful tool to combat the fact that a third of eligible Americans do not vote on Election Day. Test your knowledge How is money reshaping American politics? Take our quiz. Photos of the Day Photos of the Day 11/18 The idea for the campaign, whose 4,000 partners also include Google, Tumblr, and Reddit, was born in 2008, when about 6 million people were unable to vote because they did not register, either because they didn’t know about or missed a deadline, according to NationalVoterRegistrationDay.org. " We want everyone to celebrate," Matt Singer, founder of the movement, told CNET. "A lot of web platforms are known for having a young audience, like Tumblr, but ... I think everyone in America uses Google." Facebook kicked things off Friday, displaying a reminder at the top of newsfeeds. The pinned post showed users above the age of 18 how to vote and which of their friends have already registered. Google has also been offering a tool that includes options for registration, as well as deadlines in your state. This year, the search engine also added voter registration in Spanish. Twitter rolled out the official #iRegistered hashtag complete with an emoji of an American flag top hat over 2016. #NationalVoterRegistrationDay was also trending on Twitter, according to USA Today. All the sites participating directed users to a federal website that linked them to voter registration pages for their home states. In addition to Georgia, 47,000 Minnesotans updated their registrations or registered for the first time over the weekend, according to the Minnesota Secretary of State. On just Friday, almost 27,000 users accessed the system, nearly four times more than the previous one-day record. More than 25,000 residents in both Kentucky and in Indiana updated their registration or registered for the first time, according to The Hill. Almost 200,000 registered voters in California created or updated their records on Monday alone, the second most active day since the state’s online registration was created, according to Secretary of State Alex Padilla. More than 60 percent of these Californians were under the age of 35, and a third were under 25, according to The Hill. These statistics stand in stark contrast to the 35 percent of US citizens eligible to vote in 2012 that were not registered, according to census data. It also shows the evolution of voter registration efforts, since social media platforms have used their sites to encourage voters to turn out. “While politically active citizens have for years tried to track down unregistered, yet eligible, voters and coax them to the polls by knocking on doors or setting up informational booths, the presence of more subtle nudges on social media could help to determine Facebook’s influence on voting behavior,” writes Amanda Hoover for The Christian Science Monitor. Before today, the social media platform had estimated that its reminders influenced 1.5 million people to register when it started the notifications during the primaries, according to USA Today.    Facebook and other sites also have a proven record of persuading voters to turn out to the polls. A study by published in Nature found that in the 2010 congressional elections, 340,000 additional people voted because of Facebook reminders. “While the network’s push helped, users who saw that their closest friends had clicked an 'I voted' button on the site were even more likely to vote,” writes Ms. Hoover. Other states are still sifting through the weekend data, according to The Hill. But many expect to set similar one-day records. Next up Test your knowledge How is money reshaping American politics?

TechShout Gadgets Software Hardware Mobile Phones Internet Apple Features Everything Else Home Gadgets Google to launch Andromeda-running Pixel 3 laptop, Huawei Nexus tablet Gadgets Google to launch Andromeda-running Pixel 3 laptop, Huawei Nexus tablet By Bindu Nair - Advertisements Google seems to have big plans for its hardware lineup, with two new reports lifting the veil on a laptop and tablet which will run its much-fabled Andromeda OS. The search giant is expected to out two Pixel smartphone on October 4 and may even demo the latter software during the event. To recap, talk about Andromeda started up again recently with the arrival of an innocuous-sounding tweet by a Google official. Two independent and apparently reliable sources are now telling Android Police that the Android-Chrome OS mashup will run on a new Pixel notebook which will see the light of day sometime in Q3 2017. The new laptop is codenamed Bison and known by the nickname Pixel 3. The device will notably not be marketed as a new Chromebook and could be priced at $799. In terms of design, the 12.3-inch offering is expected to give the MacBook a run for its money with a slimmer form factor measuring under 10mm. The ultra-thin laptop could also support a tablet mode. Also Read: Google Pixel gets leaked in official render However, it’s not clear as yet whether Google plans to adopt a Lenovo Yoga-style convertible or Microsoft Surface Book-esque detachable style. Specs-wise, the notebook could pack an Intel m3 or i5 processor, 32GB or 128GB of room, and 8GB or 16GB of RAM. Accordingly, it might be sold in two variants. Other features predicted to make an appearance include two USB Type-C ports, stylus support, a 3.5mm headphone jack, a backlit keyboard, a fingerprint scanner, stereo speakers, a battery which will supposedly last for 10 hours, and quad microphones. Intriguingly, Google may even install a glass trackpad which could utilize haptic and force detection, just like the MacBook. Moving on to the tablet, 9to5Google thinks the device will be manufactured by Huawei and may or may not bear the Nexus branding. The product is likely the same product leaked by Evan Blass a few weeks ago. If accurate, it may sport a 7-inch display, 4GB of RAM, and be ready before the end of the year.

TechShout Gadgets Software Hardware Mobile Phones Internet Apple Features Everything Else Home Software Google announces YouTube Go, Google Stations, Play Store update Software Google announces YouTube Go, Google Stations, Play Store update By Sohil Nikam - Advertisements Google celebrates its 18th birthday today and has decided to go about the occasion in style by announcing a slew of new products at its second Google for India event. Most of the offerings are India-first and data-centric, with the company aiming to appeal to first-time internet users who utilize basic phones with a 2G connection and limited data. The first product up for discussion is YouTube Go, a lighter version of the regular app. Google is going to kickstart extensive user tests for the new application. It can apparently load and play videos smoothly across a number of connectivity situations. The tool even lets you share saved videos with friends via Bluetooth, effectively circumventing any internet usage. Moreover, consumers will also get to see a quality preview of the video and its file size before it plays, allowing them to have some control over how much data they utilize. The second major new product outed at the event is Google Station. While Google already has a widespread Wi-Fi presence in India thanks to its railway-focused Wi-Fi project, the firm is now looking to expand beyond train stations. Google Stations will provide partners with an easy set of tools covering hardware and software to setup their own hotspots at public places like bus stops and malls. The next big announcement concerns an already existing app, Allo. Google’s AI-fueled communication tool is getting a language upgrade to Hindi later this year. Interestingly, its Assistant-powered Smart Replies chatbot is also going to get the ability to deliver answers in the language. Also Read: Google to launch Andromeda-running Pixel 3 laptop, Huawei Nexus tablet Chrome for mobile is also getting an India-flavored update courtesy an expanded Data Saver mode. The application will now save up to 67% of video data and optimize pages when a 2G connection is active to save more than 90% of data. It’s also getting a Downloads tab which allows users to save videos, music, pictures and pages offline. Even Google Play is getting a revamp in the form of two experimental additions. One lets the app pre-load the most popular parts of the store on Wi-Fi and the other serves up a ‘Wait for Wi-Fi’ option when installing an application. Finally, Google News is getting a Lite mode that uses one-third the data by loading only headlines and trimming components down to essentials.

Photo: Bloomberg New Delhi: Google India celebrated its 18th birthday by announcing five new products tailored for the India market at its ‘Google for India’ event in New Delhi on Tuesday. This includes new products built specifically for India—YouTube Go; the Google Assistant in Hindi inside its recently launched messaging app Allo; faster browsing for Google Play on 2G connections; as well as new, global platforms inspired by the needs of Indian users—the Google Station Wi-Fi platform; and new data-saving features in Google Chrome for mobile. Rajan Anandan, vice-president, India and South-East Asia, set the agenda at the start of the event by outlining what Google India had accomplished over the last year and what its strategy was going forward to get the next billion users in India online. Caesar Sengupta, vice-president, Next Billion Users, outlined the three main areas where Google is working to provide a better and more inclusive online experience for users in India: access (connecting people to the Internet), platforms (letting people and developers share through and build upon the Internet), and products (providing better and more relevant Google experiences for Indians). Defining the strategy, he said: “Our goal has not just been to help more Indians get online — but also to help Indians create the online experience they want; one that serves their needs and enables them to have an impact on the entire world. So we have been thinking about how to build products and services for this wave of new users—products that work for any level of connectivity, in local Indian languages, and across the devices that are most frequently used in India,” said Sengupta. Sengupta announced a new Wi-Fi platform called Google Station, inspired by the success of Google’s partnership with RailTel and Indian Railways to provide Wi-Fi at railway stations in India, with 52 stations now providing high-quality Internet to 3.5 million people each month, the latest being Mumbai CST. This new platform will work with partners to roll out Wi-Fi hotspots, offering carriers, system integrators and venues an easy way to set up high-quality, user-friendly Wi-Fi. This will provide more people in India and around the world fast, reliable, and safe Wi-Fi in more of the places where they spend time, like malls, transit stations, and cafes. Google Station aims at targeting brand new users coming online for the first time. There will be a simplified unified login that will make Google Station easily discoverable to users. Besides this, Sengupta also announced fast browsing in Google Play for people on 2G and other low-bandwidth connections. Fast browsing uses preloading on Wi-Fi to load the most popular parts of Google Play quickly. And when a user on a low-bandwidth connection chooses to install an app, Google Play will offer a new “Wait for Wi-Fi” option where the app will only install when the phone next connects to Wi-Fi. Fast browsing launches on Tuesday as an experiment exclusively to Play users in India. Similarly, Rahul Roy-Chowdhury, vice-president, product management, Chrome, announced a group of tailored features for Chrome that make the web a better place for mobile users facing data constraints. Also Read: Can Google Allo match up with Apple’s Siri? The new Data Saver mode— which reduces the amount of data Chrome uses on Android mobile devices, computers, and Chromebooks — will now support MP4 videos, saving up to two-thirds (67%) of video data. Chrome on Android will now also automatically optimize pages to their essentials when 2G-like networks are detected. These simplified pages load up to 2X faster, saving more than 90% of data usage. Chrome on Android’s new Download feature will now allow users to save web pages, videos, music, or pictures. Downloaded items can be easily accessed in Chrome’s new downloads tab, even when offline. And if users go offline before the download is complete, the process will automatically resume next time they’re connected. John Giannandrea, senior vice-president of search, talked through the improved support for more Indian languages in Google products and the evolution of search to meet the needs of mobile users while Amit Fulay, group product manager, announced that a preview of the Google Assistant will be launched in Hindi by the end of 2016 inside the brand new Allo messaging app. The Google Assistant lets users have a conversation with Google, which can help them get things done. However, the biggest announcement was that of YouTube Go—a new YouTube mobile app reimagined for the next generation of YouTube users in India. YouTube Go is designed and built from insights gathered from all over India, especially rural India, and has been completely reimagined from the ground up for the next generation of YouTube users to fully discover all that YouTube has to offer. It is born out of extensive research done across 15 cities in India by teams of engineers, designers, and researchers collecting ideas and testing prototypes with hundreds of people. Over the next few months, YouTube will be rolling the app out gradually to more testers, getting their feedback and improving the product before launching it to the general public. At the launch of YouTube Go, Johanna Wright, YouTube vice-president for product management, said: “YouTube Go is a brand new app to help the next generation of users share and enjoy videos. YouTube Go was designed and built from the ground up with insights from India, in order to bring the power of video to mobile users in a way that is more conscious of their data and connectivity, while still being locally relevant and social. YouTube Go not only allows users to save and watch videos smoothly even in poor connectivity, it also gives them transparency and control over how much data they consume on videos, allowing them to preview videos first and choose the video’s file size before they save it offline to watch later. They can also share videos easily with friends and family nearby, without using any data at all.” In 2014, Google had launched YouTube Offline so people could watch videos without buffering. A few months ago the company rolled out Smart Offline, a feature that allows scheduling videos to be saved offline later for off-peak times when there’s more bandwidth so data is faster and cheaper. Now, YouTube Go is for the next generation of YouTube users to fully discover all that YouTube has to offer. “With YouTube Go, we’re bringing the power of video to mobile users in a way that is more conscious of their data and connectivity, while being relatable and social,” Wright added.

Welcome to the new Pixel phone era. With premium features exclusive to Pixel phones and a sales plan that means you might actually find one in a store, the company is showing significantly more ambition than it did with the last six years of Nexus-branded phones. The 5-inch Pixel and 5.5-inch Pixel XL are officially called "Pixel, a phone by Google" and have a "G" on the back, signifying how Google designed the phones on its own instead of tweaking another company's product into a Nexus. Google is now the one picking components, providing support and promoting the phones. Pixel, the first real Google phone, in pictures See full gallery 1 - 4 of 35 Next Prev More from Google's event Google Pixel phones, Daydream View and Chromecast Ultra: Everything Google just announced Google's Pixel, Pixel XL are superphones set to take on iPhone 7 See all of our Google coverage So what does that ambition get you? Unlike last year's mid-range Nexus 5X and premium Nexus 6P, the Pixel phones are both top-shelf models. Google wants you to think of them as rivals to the most prestigious models out there, Apple's iPhones and Samsung Galaxy models. They each have quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processors -- two cores running at 2.15GHz and two at a more battery-efficient 1.6GHz -- with a boost from Qualcomm's Hexagon technology for tasks such as image and audio processing. The phones have OLED screens, 4GB of memory and either 32GB and 128GB of storage space. Starting at $649 in the US, £599 in the UK and AU$1,079 in Australia, the 32GB Pixel is about the same price as Apple's iPhone 7 and Samsung's Galaxy S7. The 128GB model costs $749, £699 or AU$1,229 and the corresponding Pixel XL models cost $769 and $869, £719 and £819 or AU$1269 and AU$1,419. Preorders begin now, with the phone arriving in stores and online on October 20. There's no expandable storage. Below the Pixel phones' "G" logo is one of several accents showing where antennas can harness radio signals. Stephen Shankland/CNET Google went adverb-happy with the colors: "very silver," "quite black" and "really blue." Limited availability means only the US will get the blue version initially. The back of the phone is actually two-tone, with a glossy "glass shade" across the top to make antennas work better and a more ordinary bead-blasted metal finish across the bottom. Like the front display, the glass shade employs Gorilla Glass 4 for scratch resistance. In the hand, the Pixel's metal-and-glass body definitely feels a step above Google's previous Nexus handsets, with fewer exposed seams. The smooth aluminum makes for a premium, iPhone-like feel, but with chamfered edges that make it a bit less slippery. Enlarge Image The blue is pretty flashy, but looks surprisingly attractive in person. James Martin/CNET And while the glass shade might look a little odd, it feels pretty good to the touch, adding a bit of tacky grip. The fingerprint reader also rests neatly under one's index finger, like last year's Nexus smartphones. And I particularly like how Google weighted these phones: they've got some nice solid heft without feeling too heavy like many all-metal phones, or so light (like the Nexus 5X) that they feel hollow. A few features will help the phones stand out from other models powered by Google's Android software. They'll be the only ones to include Google Assistant, a new beefed-up version of Google's conversational system to control the phone and answer questions -- Google's rival to Apple's Siri, Microsoft's Cortana and Amazon's Alexa. It'll also store all photos and video in original resolution for the life of the phone, shuttling older shots to cloud storage if you run out of room. And if you need to call Google's support, a technician will be able to remotely control your phone. Android 7.1 -- the latest version of Nougat -- debuts with the Pixels. Fans of the decades-old 3.5 mm audio jack standard will be happy to see one on the Google Pixel phone. Stephen Shankland/CNET Unlike the iPhone 7, the Pixel phones retain a 3.5 mm headphone jack -- but Pixels come with no headphones, because really, don't you already have some? There's no camera bump, but the Pixels aren't the thinnest phone around. They're slightly wedge-shaped, tapering from 8.6 mm at the top end to 7.4 mm at the bottom. The Pixel is 69.5 mm wide by 143.8 mm tall (2.73 by 5.66 inches), while the Pixel XL is 75.7 by 154.7 mm (2.98 by 6.09 inches). Screen resolutions are 1,920x1080 at 441 pixels per inch for the Pixel and 2,560x1,440 at 534ppi for the XL. Based on a brief test, it seems Google has made good on its promise that the main 12-megapixel camera performs much faster than last year's Nexus models -- see CNET's in-depth look at the Pixel camera for more detail. Another useful feature of Android 7.1 is that there's no more long pause when you rotate the phone from portrait to landscape orientation. The company stuck with Sony for the camera's sensor but promises faster autofocus. There's no optical image stabilization like in the iPhone 7 -- nor are there the dual rear cameras of the iPhone 7 Plus -- but Google thinks its fast image processing will do the trick when trying to compensate for your unsteady shooting. The front-facing camera has an 8-megapixel sensor, and twisting the phone back and forth switches to it from the main camera. Stephen Shankland/CNET The fingerprint reader on the center of the back gets a new trick, too: if you swipe down on it, it shows your notifications even as it unlocks the phone. The Pixels, like the Nexus models of 2015, use the newer USB Type-C port for data links and charging. When watching video or browsing the internet, battery life should be 13 hours for the Pixel and 14 for the Pixel XL. The batteries can't be removed. And careful by the pool, because the Pixel phones are only rated to IP53 when it comes to dust and liquid resistance -- good enough to handle a splash and some rain, not a full dunk like the Samsung and Apple flagship phones can. Google is leaning on HTC to assemble the phone. The Taiwanese manufacturer has a long history with Google, building the first-ever Android phone, the T-Mobile G1 "Dream" that debuted in 2008, and the Nexus One that inaugurated the Nexus line in 2010. Google has also partnered with Samsung, LG Electronics, Motorola and Huawei to build Nexus phones. Android partnerships remain. But there's no more pussyfooting around here -- Google is competing directly against Samsung and other partners who use Google's Android software.

By Todd Haselton | September 27, 2016 Share Stay Connected with Us! Follow TechnoBuffalo Last night, Evan Blass published the first press image of the Google Pixel on Venture Beat. It’s the smartphone we’re expecting Google to unveil during its event on October 4. Now Blass is back, this time with the Google Pixel XL. This is supposed to be the more powerful of the two smartphones, and it’s kind of a big deal. The Pixel devices will launch this year in place of Google’s “Nexus” smartphones, which were previously aimed at developers and, most recently, Android purists. The device you see above is expected to serve as the new flagship device, showing off all of what Android Nougat has to offer. In fact, it may even run Android 7.1 Nougat out of the box. Rumor has it the Pixel XL will offer a 5.5-inch Quad HD display, a 12MP camera, an 8MP front-facing camera, USB-C, a large 3,450MAh battery and more. The picture above looks a hair boring, so maybe Google has some surprises up its sleeves.

What still is very much up for grabs, however, is which mobile OS will grab the third spot. Blog :  Apple’s Latest Push into the Enterprise Article :  BlackBerry CEO Chen to Enterprise: 'We Are Very Much Alive, Thank You' Big News on the Operating System Front Coming from Google Carl Weinschenk |   Data and Telecom   |   Posted 27 Sep, 2016          |         |     Share Why and How to Build an Enterprise App Store Google seems set to take a big step on the operating system (OS) front, according to reports. Android Police reported yesterday that two “independent and reliable sources” told it that Google is planning to release a laptop in the third quarter that will be driven by an OS that combines Android and Chrome. The tech field is rife with acronyms. In this case, the project is “Bison,” the laptop is the “Pixel 3” and the new OS is “Andromeda.” “Fuchsia” is another new operating system being worked on by Google. The relationship, if any, between Andromeda and Fuchsia is unclear. But something clearly is happening. IDC Vice President of Research John Jackson told IT Business Edge that any step must be taken with great care: If this is true, the devil will lurk in the architectural implications for developers and the broader ecosystem, particularly on the app-centric Android side. Convergence to date has preserved the core integrity of either platform. With Android, Google has created for itself a commanding position on smartphones – history’s most prolifically distributed computing environment. And it has profited mightily from this as the world’s experiences and eyeballs have shifted to mobile. Obviously, any sort of binary break resulting from a unified OS approach risks disrupting the mobile position. But Google doesn’t need an analyst to tell them that. The Android Police story provides a lot of commentary on what it believes the laptop, which will be capable of converting to a tablet, will cost and other technical details. In mid-August, there were reports about Fuchsia. Those reports suggested that the operating system would use the Magenta kernel instead of the Linux kernel. This led experts to suspect that Fuchsia would be aimed at the embedded market, such as car GPS systems, and not general purpose computing. The relationship between Andromeda and Fuchsia is unclear, according to Pocket-lint. The story says that more light may be shed on Google’s plans soon. The main evidence is a tweet from Google Senior Vice President of Android, Chrome OS and Play, Hiroshi Lockheimer, that points to the next week’s Made by Google Event: We announced the first version of Android eight years ago today. I have a feeling eight years from now we'll be talking about Oct 4, 2016. It is possible, though a bit unlikely, that he is not referring to anything related to these rumors. It seems more likely that the company has made some key strategic decisions. IDC’s Johnson has a feeling for what is at stake: If this is true it will be interesting to see which OS ‘wins.’ Recall that Chrome is organic Google and therefore most closely reflects the company’s philosophy about how digital services should evolve. Android was a timely and highly effective acquisition. Android and Chrome have been growing closer, in part because Chrome OS includes Google Play Store access in beta. The likelihood is that the relationship will grow even closer a week from today. Carl Weinschenk covers telecom for IT Business Edge.

We are trying our best with high-speed connectivity with Railtel, Railwire and Google Station. But the reality is that we are in a very large country with relatively constrained amount of spectrum. We are probably going to see constraints throughout,” said Caesar Sengupta, vice-president, Next Billion Users at Google. He added that many Indians do not have the levels of income to buy data indiscriminately. The company on Tuesday launched a slew of products that can work on 2G data, low bandwidth and almost no connectivity. “Jio and all the operators are key partners for us in providing more access. Anything that happens there helps us, users and the overall ecosystem. By offering an actual 4G network at very interesting prices and taking some bold bets, we think we are going to catalyse the data revolution here,” said Sengupta. The company has re-calibrated itself to low data connectivity issues, Sengupta said. “I do not see that changing, in fact, I see that getting worse. The people willing to pay for data are already online. Now, if you want to expand to the remaining 800 million users, we have to figure out ways where they can eke more out of the data they have. That is why it is important to get our apps working on low data more efficiently,” said Sengupta. Google is working on various revenue generation models, sources said, though revenue is not the focus at present. Regional languages, the firm believes, would help bring new users and generate revenue from advertisements. GOOGLE’S QUEST IN INDIA New video app, YouTube Go, designed and built from India experience Google Assistant in Hindi to preview inside Allo later this year A Wi-Fi platform called Google Station inspired by success of Railwire Wi-Fi Offline feature for Chrome web browser and faster loading in Google Play on 2G Plans to train 2 mn mobile developers on Android, over 120,000 students have already enrolled in the Android Fundamentals course It is also funding installation of Google Developers Codelabs at major state technical universities in India Google in partnership with RailTel and railways is providing high-quality internet to 3.5 mn people each month at 50-plus stations “To be honest, we are already monetising. When you go to YouTube to watch your favourite video, you will most likely see an advertisement that is relevant to you. We do not think of monetisation separately from the overall experience. It is what makes the service sustainable and makes us invest more,” he said. After initiating a plan to launch Wi-Fi at 400 stations across the country, the company is working on creating Wi-Fi hotspots in malls and public areas, which could be a revenue source later.  “It is a consumer effort we want to get out, monetisation is very important for the venues. We want to make sure this is sustainable for our partners. In some cases, venues are going to choose to make it free, but in many cases a venue might need us to monetise footfalls and use that to subsidise data, fibre and infrastructure costs. It is still too early comment on the specifics,” said Sengupta. The company is trying to approach partners, including mall owners, to assess their needs and design the right option for them. The company is also planning to launch Allo, its messaging app, which has an AI-based assistant that would be available in Hindi by the year end. “With the Hindi assistant for Allo, we are going a lot deeper. We are going to start with Hindi and expand,” added Sengupta.

Google is making a big push into India this week with several new products intended to get people online without draining their data and bank accounts. During the second Google for India event, the company unveiled the data-saving YouTube Go app (pictured) and lighter versions of flagship products, but also tipped more options for activating public Wi-Fi and Hindi for Google Assistant. YouTube Go promises smooth video plays "across various connectivity situations," Caesar Sengupta, vice president of Google's Next Billion Users team, wrote in a blog post. He promised control over data consumption and the ability to share videos without eating into data allotments. It will roll out first in India as a beta app; locals can sign up online to find out when it launches. Google also promised data optimization in the updated Chrome for Android, which will display only the essentials when 2G-like networks are detected. A new download feature also lets users save Web pages, videos, music, and pictures to their phone for offline use. Access it in Chrome's new Downloads tab. Similarly, Google Play added two experimental features: pre-loading the most popular parts of the store when on a wireless connection and the option to "Wait for Wi-Fi" before installing a new app. Google News and Weather's new "Lite mode" will also keep the headlines and trim the rest, ensuring the app loads more quickly while providing only the bare essentials. Slower networks automatically trigger Lite mode. "Added up, that's a lot of data saved, speeds accelerated, and new connections made," Sengupta said. Google is also broadening its free public Wi-Fi program. Last year, it announced plans to provide high-speed public Wi-Fi in 400 train stations across India. That's now live in more than 50 rail stations in India, but to help speed up the rollout, partners can now access Google Station, which is software and guidance on how to roll out wireless hotspots in public places. //Related Articles India Tops US as Second Most Internet-Connected Nation "By getting great Wi-Fi into the world's malls, bus stops, city centers, and cafes … millions more people will be able to learn, play, chat, work, and find the information they need," Sengupta wrote. "We're just getting started," he added, putting out the call for "strategic, forward-thinking" partners. Meanwhile, Google's new Allo chat app is currently only available in English, but it is also learning to speak Hindi—a feature rolling out later this year.

And be called the Google Pixel Google's upcoming October 4 event is expected to bring, potentially, the most important Android smartphone yet: an official Google phone. And the folks at VentureBeat claim to have an early look. Google generally focuses on refining Android's software while hardware makers worry about building the perfect phone. Handset manufacturers like Samsung, LG, Motorola and more are able to put Android on their devices, alleviating worries of creating their own OS like Apple. Though with Google likely getting serious about hardware, the search company is expected to put out an above-average phone that would ideally be the best to own. VentureBeat claims that this mythical Android device, likely called the Google Pixel, will ship with a 5-inch screen, quad-core 2.4 GHz 64-bit processor, 4GB of RAM, 32GB of storage, a 12 megapixel camera and a 2,770 mAh battery. The larger Pixel XL will offer a 5.5-inch screen with a 3,450 mAh battery and QHD (1440p) display. In comparison, Apple's latest iPhone 7 Plus comes with an A10 processor, 32 GB of storage, two 12-megapixel cameras, 3GB of RAM, and a 2,900 mAh battery. The Google device (rumored to be built by HTC) will possibly make use of a USB-C charging port, offer a fingerprint scanner on the backside and come with a headphone jack. But more interesting is the potential inclusion of the Google Assistant. The Pixel phone could have Google Assistant baked right in The virtual Google helper, titled Google Assistant, debuted alongside Allo--the company's messaging app. The app for Android and iOS not only allowed users to chat with friends, but also with a digital assistant that would fetch information in its own chat window, or even while you were in a chat with someone else. Instead of requiring users to speak out loud, the Google Assistant allows users to type out questions and responses. The above gif, hailing from Android Police, speculates that the updated version of Android will more closely integrate the recently revealed assistant. Google Assistant throughout Android would not only allow Google users to say "Ok, Google" to summon their assistant, but type to it too. And combining this with Google's On Tap--which provides relevant info on whatever you may be looking at in that moment--Android users may have yet one more way of conveniently extracting the information they seek. This isn't the first time Google has hinted at an official Android phone. The Android Silver program was an earlier attempt from the company to release one flagship phone, assuring consumers' a quality Android experience. And the Nexus line of devices, while initially meant for developers, acted as Google's pseudo-official device. But doing so always presents the challenge of the search company doing a disservice to their hardware partners. Premium hardware plus software only available on the holy-grail Google device could spell trouble for Samsung--in addition to flaming phones. We won't know for sure what Google has to announce until its October 4 event takes place. Tune into Popular Science as we bring you updates from the event!

This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed. NEW YORK (CNNMoney) Google wants to do a lot more for mobile users in India. The tech giant laid out its plans on Tuesday at an event in New Dehli to help people save data and get online. To start, Google is adapting its apps to handle slower mobile connections and is looking to add more Wi-Fi hotspots across the country. "While most of today's launches focus on Google users in India... it gives us better ideas that work for everyone," the company said in a blog post. With an expected population of 1.4 billion by 2022, India is a critical market for many tech companies. But only one fifth of the country's adults have access to the internet -- often at slow connections. This poses a challenge and opportunity for Google and its main competitor in the country, Facebook. Facebook's Free Basics program offers free internet access to a limited number of websites, including Facebook, but regulators pushed back. Regulators ruled that companies can't charge different prices for various types of data, and by making parts of the internet free, Facebook violated the premise. For now, Google is taking a different approach to tailoring its products for the region. Here's a look at what's planned: New YouTube app Google has announced a new app called YouTube Go designed to work offline or on very poor connections. The company says its engineers visited 15 cities in India to learn more about connectivity issues in the country and to test the service. In addition to working with spotty data access, the app provides users with information on how much data a video might require. That way, they can decide if they want to watch or skip to cut down on phone bills. YouTube Go will launch first in India, and eventually roll out to other markets. Less data usage on Chrome, News and Google Play Google is updating its Chrome browser, Google Play store and News apps to save users data. Chrome's Data Saver mode will automatically optimize webpages when 2G-like connections are detected, which could save more than 90% of user data, according to Google. The updated Data Saver mode will also compress MP4 videos now, saving up to 67% of video data. Within the Google News and Weather apps, a new Lite mode feature will kick in when users access a slow internet connection. As a result, the apps will "trim" down content on the sites so it's easier to load. This will use about one-third the data. Google has also activated a speed detection and recalibration feature in its Google Play app store. For example, it will give those in India using a 2G connection the option to wait for a Wi-Fi connection to install an app. More Wi-Fi hotspots Google launched a partnership with Indian Railways and RailTel last year to install Wi-Fi access points at more than 50 stations across India. The company wants to build on that progress with a newly created program called Google Station. Google describes the initiative as providing "an easy set of tools to roll-out Wi-Fi hotspots in public places" via high-speed fiber connections. The company said it sees itself partnering with businesses and local governments to bring these hotspots to bus stops, city centers, malls and cafes. Hindi language support for Google Assistant Google Assistant is one of the best parts about using Allo, Google's new messaging app. The feature lets users interact with Google in a conversational way to perform search queries and digital tasks. Google Assistant is also what powers "Smart Replies" -- suggested responses to messages that come in through the app. Allo rolled out in India first, but Google Assistant only understands English at the moment. Later this year, it will respond to requests and suggest replies in Hindi. © Distributed by LAKANA. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.

Music News Entertainment Politics Features Share < br />this article: Google searches for ‘registrarse para votar’ hit all-time high during debate In Politics by Jamie Peck / September 27, 2016 Share < br />this article: Follow @jamie_elizabeth Spanish language searches for voter registration information hit an all-time high during Monday’s night’s presidential debate, according to Google. The Washington Post reports that the term became the engine’s third trending search around 10:30 p.m. Monday, spiking to an all-time high of 100,000 queries. (Note: Google’s “trending” search topics are not necessarily the most searched, but the ones that are spiking the most in terms of their proportion of total searches. So basically, a lot more people were searching it during the debate than before the debate.) “According to Google, search volume was highest in the ever-important swing state of Florida, followed by New Jersey, New York, Texas and California,” notes WaPo. ¿Qué pasó? Maybe Spanish-speaking voters were not down with Trump’s “more stop and frisk” response to the question of how he’d improve race relations in the United States. Maybe they were annoyed by his braggadocious assertion that he’d been endorsed by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the agency that carries out deportations. Maybe they looked into it, found out it was actually the union that represents customs agents that endorsed him, and were like “still, fuck this guy.” Maybe they thought it was bullshit how he blamed Mexico for stealing American jobs, as if the companies that moved there had no agency in the matter. Or maybe, like many people watching, they just thought he was a dangerous idiot worth taking a few minutes out of one’s day to vote against. Maybe all of the above. It definitely wasn’t so they could vote for Trump; a recent Wall Street Journal/NBC poll showed Clinton beating him among Hispanic voters 65% to 17%. The spike could also be attributable to Google adding a knowledge box that uses its creepy triangulation technology to automatically pull up voter registration information for one’s district when people type in Spanish phrases wondering how to vote (it only used to do it for phrases in English), which would mean Google reverse-engineered this whole story and timed it perfectly. It’s probably all of the above, though.

BUSINESS Technology What separates Snapchat Spectacles from Google Glass: simplicity Spectacles Snap Inc. Snapchat, which is reorganizing under the name Snap, unveiled sunglasses over the weekend that integrate a video camera into the frame. Snapchat, which is reorganizing under the name Snap, unveiled sunglasses over the weekend that integrate a video camera into the frame. (Snap Inc.) Paresh Dave A paparazzi photograph of Snapchat Chief Executive Evan Spiegel prematurely revealed the Los Angeles company’s first piece of consumer electronics: a pair of video camera sunglasses. Though it spoiled the surprise delivered last week, the fact that Spiegel felt comfortable wearing the shades where he did — in public with his supermodel fiancee a year ago — suggests the gadget may succeed where similar products from rivals fell short. Google, Facebook and others that have released head-mounted technology have presumed their tools would get people to significantly adjust their behavior. With a product that looks like ordinary sunglasses with some odd decoration on the hinges, Snapchat is going for a softer nudge. It’s encouraging people to try a familiar-looking product to experiment with a new way of taking videos. Spiegel may have a plan for smartglasses as sophisticated as Google Glass or Facebook’s Oculus Rift, but he’s starting off with a goofy name, one feature, an on-trend look, a lower price and no public goal of doing anything more than helping people preserve memories. If he’s right, Snapchat Spectacles could become the first piece of high-tech headgear that people want to wear and feel comfortable being around. Spectacles integrate a small video camera and a notification light in the corners where lenses meet hinges. The camera wirelessly transmits 10-second clips to Snapchat’s image-sharing app, one of the world’s most popular mobile services. Though they don’t facilitate selfies, Spectacles capture wide-angle circular video, enabling viewers to rotate their mobile devices to see more of a scene than a smartphone video does. The sunglasses will cost $130 when they launch this fall. “What if you could go back and see that memory the way you experienced it?” Snapchat said in a blog post Saturday. “That’s why we built Spectacles.” A bare-chested Spiegel wore them on the beach in Corsica, legs dipped in the water, as he embraced fiancee Miranda Kerr. The scene exemplifies how Spiegel envisions the new gadget to be used. Spectacles are a toy, he told the Wall Street Journal magazine, meant to be worn for fun at friendly events like barbecues or while on a hike. Snapchat’s first foray into electronics immediately drew comparisons to Google Glass, the augmented reality device with a wire-thin frame and a cube-shaped, see-through display. Google envisioned Glass as a smartphone replacement designed for all-day wearing, with text messages appearing on the screen and replies sent by voice command.   Why Disney is unlikely to buy Twitter Daniel Miller and Tracey Lien One is an entertainment giant famous for exacting tight control over its content. The other is a tech firm whose commitment to free speech has earned it a reputation as a hub for news and a haven for online harassment.  Together, they make for a brow-raising pairing. But stranger things have happened... One is an entertainment giant famous for exacting tight control over its content.

But stranger things have happened... (Daniel Miller and Tracey Lien) But the search and advertising giant pulled back from the hardware early last year after consumers voiced privacy concerns about the eyewear’s camera and lacked enthusiasm about the design. Spiegel's description of Spectacles as a more limited device with far less functionality sets lower expectations. Compared with Google’s experience, that could provide a smoother path to mass adoption for Snapchat, which is reorganizing under the corporate title Snap Inc.  The name change spotlights Snap’s desire to reinvent the camera. But avoiding bold statements about Spectacles gives the company room to learn and adapt, said Stephanie Trunzo, chief operations officer and chief digital officer at PointSource, a digital design and development consultant. “They are putting their toe in the water without carrying the weight of enormous promises that they might not be able to follow through on,” she said. Many of the societal questions Glass raised remain unanswered. But the teenagers and young adults who make up most of Snapchat’s users may skip past those concerns quickly for a product tied to a brand they cherish. More than 150 million people use Snapchat each day for about 30 minutes on average. Teens are focused on “fun and social interactions” and worry less about privacy, said Patrick Worfolk, senior vice president and chief technology officer at touch screen technology supplier Synaptics.  Spectacles provide a natural way to take a video without having a smartphone separate videographers from subjects. The one-size-fits-all sunglasses also come in several colors and don’t look all that different from Ray-Bans or Warby Parkers. L.A. tech news: SGN to Jam City. Foursquare to Playa Vista.

Mobile game maker SGN renamed itself Jam City last week, seeking to inject more fun into its brand. For a start-up that makes colorful matching and bubble-bursting games including Juice Jam and Panda Pop, SGN — short for Social Gaming Network — came off as a stodgy and dull, the Culver City company... (Paresh Dave) “Snap Inc. is a company equally, if nor more interested in understanding cultural forces than specific technologies,” Andrew Edman, co-founder of Clear Design Lab, wrote in a blog post Monday. “Their hardware enables the culture, not the other way around. This is an incredibly rare thing for tech companies to understand and truly prioritize.” Google promoted Glass mainly to techies, asking people to write essays about how they would integrate it into their lives. It sold for about $1,500 and inspired a parody blog titled White Men Wearing Google Glass, featuring a man wearing the device in the shower.  Spiegel formally introduced Spectacles late Friday by wearing them in a black-and-white image shot by fashion photography legend Karl Lagerfeld. Kerr posted the photo on her Instagram account, quickly drawing nearly 90,000 likes over the weekend. A mass audience didn’t buy into Glass because it made people look like cyborgs, said Kayvan Mirza, chief executive of wearables maker Optinvent. Virtual reality devices including Oculus Rift and Sony PlayStation VR, which wrap around people’s heads, do no better. Even bluetooth headsets, which had their heyday because of their utility, are an object of ridicule for how they make people look. Adults might not want to don Spectacles but that only further powers Snapchat’s appeal among 13-year-olds, the ultimate arbiters of cool in many tech investors’ eyes. “Snapchat’s advantage over Google is they know how millennials think and what they want and have them as a captive audience,” said Ori Inbar, founder and managing partner of Super Ventures. A software company developing hardware is a difficult shift, but in a space without established players, “Snapchat has a shot just like anyone else,” Inbar said. Spectacles could affect more than the wearables market. Action camera maker GoPro could lose some users and buyers to Spectacles, while Snap rival Facebook may seek a way to respond with a product of its own. Snap also benefits from less baggage about privacy snafus than Facebook and Google.  Spectacles’ appeal could widen if Snap allows other app makers to take advantage of the camera too. The product’s website carries the description “Just for Snapchat.” Snap spokespeople declined to comment about the label. They also refused to answer questions about Spectacles’ components, manufacturing plans and details about how and when it would be sold. Filings by Snapchat to the Federal Communications Commission name Chinese technology company Goertek as the Spectacles’ manufacturer. A spokesperson for Goertek, which lists Snapchat, Samsung and Microsoft as partners on its website, couldn’t immediately comment. Spiegel said the rollout of Spectacles would be slow and limited as the company figures out how they fit into people’s lives. Users tap a button near the hinge to record clips. A light goes off on the frame to alert people the camera is recording. The battery lasts about a day. Snapchat, an advertising-supported app for sharing photos and videos up to 10 seconds in length, will gain a new revenue stream with the sunglasses. Any money is welcome to push the company toward profitability as  it prepares for an expected initial public offering of stock next year. It’s Los Angeles’ most valuable start-up, with investors pegging its valuation at more than $16 billion. In a blog post describing the reasons for the name change to Snap, Spiegel seemed to tease the IPO. “You can search Snapchat or Spectacles for the fun stuff and leave Snap Inc. for the Wall Street crowd,” he wrote.

Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY (3) Google Fiber will bring its high-speed internet access to several low-income housing centers in Salt Lake City. In partnership with city officials and the Utah Nonprofit Housing Corp., Google Fiber announced this week it will offer its fiber-optic services to residents of three downtown properties at 135 S. 300 East, known as Lorna Doone Apartments, free of charge. Google Fiber is an internet, TV and phone-service provider offering web speeds up to one gigabit per second. After nearly 18 months of study and network installation, the Mountain View, Calif.-based company in August unveiled its first customer service area spanning central in Salt Lake City, with additional areas to come. VIDEOS TOP JOBS Its announcement in conjunction with Utah Nonprofit Housing Corp. heralds the company's first installation in Utah's capital under its Gigabit Communities Program, one of many designed to address the "digital divide" in Google Fiber host cities and extend internet access to disadvantaged users. A spokeswoman for the housing nonprofit said Google's initiative, with potential to affect hundreds of residents, would bolster and extend the reach of the agency's self-sufficiency programs. Through added donations from businesses, Utah Nonprofit Housing Corp. will be expanding computer facilities at select housing sites to bring remote learning programs to all 55 on the housing nonprofit's locations, as well as digital-literacy training for first-time internet users. Google Fiber's parent company, Alphabet Inc., selected Salt Lake City as a host city in March 2015, adding it to a list of nearly 25 U.S. cities where the service is live, under construction or in the planning stages, including Provo; Morrisville, N.C.; Nashville and Chattanooga, Tenn.; and Austin, Texas. Since coming to Utah's capital, Google has developed partnerships with Spy Hop's digital youth program; Neighborhood House efforts directed at seniors; Salt Lake County Housing Authority; and the Salt Lake City School District. tsemerad@sltrib.com Twitter: @TonySemerad   Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY 3 photos VIEW PHOTO GALLERY JOIN THE DISCUSSION     Post a Comment POPULAR NEWS It's not easy being black at BYU, film shows Sen.

The updates were designed, in part, to help users save data and access content even when they’re offline. First, Google announced that it has brought its Data Saver technology to videos, which it said allows users to save up to 67 percent of their data when viewing MP4 format videos through Chrome. In addition, when users are on slow connections, Google said the Data Saver technology will automatically optimize HTTP websites “to their essentials.” Google said these optimized websites save up to 90 percent of a user’s data, and will load two times faster. Elsewhere, Chrome’s new download feature will allow users to download web pages, music, pictures or videos that they’d like to browse later on. If users are downloading content and they lose their connections, the downloads will automatically resume when they reconnect. Users can browse the content they’ve downloaded in a Downloads list within the app. This downloads feature is now available in the Chrome Beta app, and Google said it will launch for all Chrome users soon. Finally, Google announced that it will add content suggestions to the new tab page in Chrome in Chrome’s next release. With this update, users will be able to scroll down on the new tab page to view recommended articles from a variety of websites. As users continue to use Chrome, the application will learn the types of content they’re interested in, and it will recommend personalized content for users to view. In a blog post, Rahul Roy-Chowdhury, vice president of product and data minimalist at Google, commented: We believe that our focus on data savings, offline capabilities and content discovery will make Chrome an even better place for you to experience the mobile web. Download the latest version of Chrome to be one of the first to try these features as we roll them out. The Chrome app is available to download for free on Google Play. < Previous Article Next Article > Advertisement Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

The ability to search in incognito mode is being added in an update to the Google app that's coming out today. But the more interesting part of the update isn't incognito mode on its own — private searches are already available in both Chrome and Safari, so that's nothing new — it's how Google is making them even more secure. Google will let you lock up private searches using Touch ID, so that if someone else is holding your unlocked phone or tablet, they won't be able to see private tabs that are still open inside the app. Making private mode a bit more private It's a small but helpful change. Ostensibly for convenience, Google doesn't close private searches when you leave its app — you have to manually close them yourself. By requiring Touch ID authorization to see those searches again, Google is able to protect against one of the reasons people might have been using a private search in the first place: family and friends seeing what they've been up to. All that said, it's worth remembering that Google's incognito mode isn't perfectly private. As Chrome warns you when you open a private tab, "Going incognito doesn’t hide your browsing from your employer, your internet service provider, or the websites you visit." In the case of the Google app, it won't hide your searches from Google, either — it just won't tie them to your account. In addition to incognito mode, today's update also includes the ability to watch YouTube videos directly in the app. Google More From The Verge Sand's End Facebook won’t call itself a media company.

Google’s UK Twitter account tweeted a GIF of the current Google Cardboard outlined and comments with a date range of 9/29/16 – 10/01/16. 29.09.16 – 01.10.16 #GoogleCardboard pic.twitter.com/HPE3BlcjNV — Google UK (@GoogleUK) September 27, 2016 It doesn’t make sense for Google to release information about a new Cardboard headset ahead of its October 4th event. But then again, if the event is going to be as large as its shaping up to be, this may be an easy way to release a smaller product without taking up much time. It’s hard to tell what Google has up its sleeves, but we’ll have to wait just a couple more days to see if this actually has any merit, or if it’s just a promotion to an almost forgotten product. local_offer    Google  Google Cardboard   Auto-load comments: Off On View comments (1) stars Further Reading New Google Live Cases available Google accounts suspended for reselling Pixel phones OnePlus 3T charging proves solid Allo gets themes, emoji suggestions, and more Google and Facebook are challenging bogus websites stars Popular this Weeklaunch 1 more_vertThis may be the Moto X 2017 closeHere’s our first look at the 2017 Moto X The Moto X 2017 may be alive and well as a new image has appeared which shows off the device’s metal body and camera cutout. 2 more_vertZTE wants to step up and fill the Nexus gap closeZTE wants to fill the gap left behind with the end of Nexus devices With the end of the Nexus line, there’s now a void in stock Android devices in the $400 range.

Apple is reportedly building a Siri-based smart home device to rival Amazon's Echo. The project—designed to control appliances, locks, lights, and curtains via voice activation—has entered prototype testing, Bloomberg reports. In an attempt to stand out from other smart speakers like the Echo and Google's upcoming Home device, Cupertino is using more advanced microphone and speaker technology. It may also employ facial recognition to help identify who is in the room or a person's emotional state, according to Bloomberg. The unnamed product—what would be the company's most significant hardware release since the Apple Watch—is expected to include iPhone-like Siri commands. Users could, for instance, ask the device to read emails, send text messages, post to social media, and stream music. Bloomberg also tipped the integration of mapping data, allowing the hub to inform owners of the best time to leave the house to beat traffic. An Apple spokesman declined to comment on the rumors and speculation. The tech titan first showed interest in home automation more than two years ago, with the introduction of HomeKit, which lets gadget makers link their smart home devices to iOS. Tell Siri to "get ready for bed," for example, and HomeKit-linked devices could make sure the garage door is closed, the thermostat is lowered, and the lights are dimmed. Cupertino engineers are reportedly testing the Echo rival in their homes right now—a common practice by Apple before launching new products, Bloomberg says. //Related Articles Why You Won't See an 'Apple Echo' Google's Home device, meanwhile, is expected this year; look for more details at the company's Oct. 4 event in San Francisco. Earlier this month, Amazon introduced a cheaper Echo Dot speaker for $49.99—$40 less than the original model, which arrived in March. Like its taller Echo sibling, the Dot gives access to Amazon's voice-powered personal assistant Alexa. Editor's Note: This story was updated at 1:25 p.m. Eastern with a response from Apple.

Follow TechnoBuffalo For the past year, Google has been testing a program in India designed to bring free Wi-Fi to public spaces. Now the company is ready to roll out the same initiative around the world under a new name: “Google Station.” Google Station promises fast Wi-Fi in public spaces, which could include cafes, malls, train stations and other venues. The company also promises to keep the service safe and offer an easy login process. Google’s offered internet access in India for free through the program, but the company hasn’t said if it plans to charge users in other countries. Google partnered with Indian Railways and local internet provider RailTel when it first launched in India, and it’s looking for new partners around the world. That could mean large venues and organizations, along with network operators, fiber providers and infrastructure companies. The new Google Station website even includes a form where interested potential partners can sign-up. Google Station is mostly focused on developing regions where internet access can be hard to come by. Google also notes that roughly 15,000 of its current users access the internet for the first time thanks to Google Station.

By Shan Wang @shansquared Sept. 27, 2016, 2:36 p.m. Sept. 27, 2016, 2:36 p.m. Hillary Clinton gave multiple shoutouts to fact checkers during the first presidential debate on Monday — but of course, directing viewers to her own site, which was churning out its own fact checks on Donald Trump’s statements throughout the night. Though TV networks (mostly) shied away from on-screen fact checking, other news organizations doubled down, in different ways. NPR, though, perhaps takes the cake with a team of more than 20 reporters offering real-time assessments on a live transcript of the debate. If you missed #DebateNight, get caught up with our fact check from the @nprpolitics team. https://t.co/YpjTXNKnhS pic.twitter.com/o8DgbBxIpx — NPR (@NPR) September 27, 2016 NPR used a transcription service that provides closed captioning via its API and fed the transcript into a single Google Doc where staffers cleaned up the transcription as it came in. Reporters, editors, the visuals team, copyeditors, researchers — ultimately more than 50 people had access to the Google Doc — scrambled to add their annotations, which were individually approved, edited, and then published. A researcher was also backreading the transcript and annotations as they were published to correct typos. 90 NPR member stations embedded NPR.org’s live annotations on their own sites, according to a spokesperson. transcription service ←→ google app script → google doc (+18 factcheckers) ←→ server → s3 → embedded widgethttps://t.co/Dzt3a0O4rL — David Eads (@eads) September 27, 2016 “We already have pretty strong experience using Google Docs in this way, but what we’ve never done, and what was a big experiment for us this time, was having an external document feeding a Google Doc,” David Eads of the NPR Visuals Team said. (From the candidates’ mouths to the full transcription online, there was a one- to two-minute lag.) “On the technical side, we leaned heavily on Google Docs’ suggestion mode, which allowed reporters to just start typing an annotation straight into the document — a candidate’s record on childcare, or whatever it was — and gave us a chance to reformat and edit.” “This is the first time we’ve done something of this scale. There’ve been predecessors, of course, and factchecking is something we hold dear at NPR, and we’ve done live annotation of speeches — but this had the biggest reach and required the biggest effort to process, partly because of the live transcript,” Amita Kelly, a digital editor on NPR’s Washington desk, said, pointing out that for other events such as the conventions, news outlets typically have access to prepared remarks ahead of time, and only have to deal with one speaker at a time on stage. They hoped to answer a few specific questions around what an audience might want from realtime fact-checking, including how much annotation was too much, and whether people even wanted to see a full transcript and would stay through the end, Kelly and Eads said. NPR.org saw 7,413,000 pageviews from 6,011,000 users, and 22 percent of visitors to the page stayed all the way to the end, according to a spokesperson. Monday was NPR.org’s highest traffic day ever, with over 5 million visits. The annotated live transcript also saw 70 percent of its traffic coming from mobile devices, and people coming from mobile actually stayed four minutes longer than people coming from desktop, according to Eads. “We think that might speak to the second screen, as well as to people who are in transit, who might want to be able to check this, people without access to sound — there could be a lot of reasons for that,” he said. “So this might be something we’d want to double down on — how to enhance that mobile experience.” HRC: "I hope the fact-checkers are turning up the volume and really working hard."

The company’s AI team calls it the Google Neural Machine Translation system, or GNMT, and it initially provided a less resource-intensive way to ingest a sentence in one language and produce that same sentence in another language. Instead of digesting each word or phrase as a standalone unit, as prior methods do, GNMT takes in the entire sentence as a whole. "The advantage of this approach is that it requires fewer engineering design choices than previous Phrase-Based translation systems," writes Quoc V. Le and Mike Schuster, researchers on the Google Brain team. When the technique was first employed, it was able to match the accuracy of those existing translation systems. Over time, however, GNMT has proved capable of both producing superior results and working at the speed required of Google’s consumer apps and services. These improvements are detailed in a new paper published this week. Google In some cases, Google says its GNMT system is even approaching human-level translation accuracy. That near-parity is restricted to transitions between related languages, like from English to Spanish and French. However, Google is eager to gather more data for "notoriously difficult" use cases, all of which will help its system learn and improve over time thanks to machine learning techniques. So starting today, Google is using its GNMT system for 100 percent of Chinese to English machine translations in the Google Translate mobile and web apps, accounting for around 18 million translations per day. Google admits that its approach still has a ways to go. "GNMT can still make significant errors that a human translator would never make, like dropping words and mistranslating proper names or rare terms," Le and Schuster explain, "and translating sentences in isolation rather than considering the context of the paragraph or page. There is still a lot of work we can do to serve our users better." But soon, as Google’s products and services continue vacuuming up valuable corner cases and rare phrasings, our phones may be capable of breaking down language barriers as effectively as a bilingual human being.

The tech giant laid out its plans on Tuesday at an event in New Dehli to help people save data and get online. To start, Google is adapting its apps to handle slower mobile connections and is looking to add more Wi-Fi hotspots across the country. “While most of today’s launches focus on Google users in India… it gives us better ideas that work for everyone,” the company said in a blog post. With an expected population of 1.4 billion by 2022, India is a critical market for many tech companies. But only one fifth of the country’s adults have access to the internet — often at slow connections. This poses a challenge and opportunity for Google and its main competitor in the country, Facebook. Facebook’s Free Basics program offers free internet access to a limited number of websites, including Facebook, but regulators pushed back. Regulators ruled that companies can’t charge different prices for various types of data, and by making parts of the internet free, Facebook violated the premise. For now, Google is taking a different approach to tailoring its products for the region. Here’s a look at what’s planned: New YouTube app Google has announced a new app called YouTube Go designed to work offline or on very poor connections. The company says its engineers visited 15 cities in India to learn more about connectivity issues in the country and to test the service. In addition to working with spotty data access, the app provides users with information on how much data a video might require. That way, they can decide if they want to watch or skip to cut down on phone bills. YouTube Go will launch first in India, and eventually roll out to other markets. Less data usage on Chrome, News and Google Play Google is updating its Chrome browser, Google Play store and News apps to save users data. Chrome’s Data Saver mode will automatically optimize webpages when 2G-like connections are detected, which could save more than 90% of user data, according to Google. The updated Data Saver mode will also compress MP4 videos now, saving up to 67% of video data. Within the Google News and Weather apps, a new Lite mode feature will kick in when users access a slow internet connection. As a result, the apps will “trim” down content on the sites so it’s easier to load. This will use about one-third the data. Google has also activated a speed detection and recalibration feature in its Google Play app store. For example, it will give those in India using a 2G connection the option to wait for a Wi-Fi connection to install an app. More Wi-Fi hotspots Google launched a partnership with Indian Railways and RailTel last year to install Wi-Fi access points at more than 50 stations across India. The company wants to build on that progress with a newly created program called Google Station. Google describes the initiative as providing “an easy set of tools to roll-out Wi-Fi hotspots in public places” via high-speed fiber connections. The company said it sees itself partnering with businesses and local governments to bring these hotspots to bus stops, city centers, malls and cafes. Hindi language support for Google Assistant Google Assistant is one of the best parts about using Allo, Google’s new messaging app. The feature lets users interact with Google in a conversational way to perform search queries and digital tasks. Google Assistant is also what powers “Smart Replies” — suggested responses to messages that come in through the app. Allo rolled out in India first, but Google Assistant only understands English at the moment. Later this year, it will respond to requests and suggest replies in Hindi.

Davide Castelvecchi 27 September 2016 Article tools Rights & Permissions Thomas Samson/AFP/Getty Images Google Translate — here shown on a mobile phone — will use deep learning to improve its translations between texts. Google's online translation service, Google Translate, will soon be using a new algorithm that is entirely based on deep learning, the company announced on 27 September. The algorithm, which is also described in a paper posted to the preprint server arXiv1, is the first widely-available computer system for translating languages that relies on the increasingly popular AI technique. Compared to the firm's existing service, the algorithm reduces errors by around 60%, Google computer scientists say. A Chinese-to-English service that uses the algorithm is now being used on the Google Translate mobile and web-based apps, and Google says that it will roll out other languages over the next few months. The advance is yet another example of the success of deep learning, which has helped crack major AI problems in recent years by combining artificial neural networks — layers of computational units that mimic the way neurons connect in the brain — with enormous data sets. Most notably, the technique has beaten other machine approaches to image recognition and game-playing. Google has now applied the same approach to language translation, to create what it calls a Neural Machine Translation system (NMTS). “From the input to the output, it’s entirely done by one neural network,” says Quoc Le, a computer scientist at Google in Mountain View, California, who helped to develop the NMTS. The NMTS borrows from others’ advances in machine learning and adds a few methodological novelties, says Yoshua Bengio, a computer scientist at the University of Montreal in Canada who has read the arXiv paper. “On a first look, it appears that they have pulled most of the known tricks,” he says. The team’s main achievement is to show that ”with solid engineering and a well-designed architecture, neural-machine translation can far outpace classical methods for machine translation”, he says, with “pretty amazing results”. The algorithm "really improves the state-of-the-art in many ways”, says Jürgen Schmidhuber, a computer scientist at the University of Lugano (also known as the USI) in Manno, Switzerland. Machine translation Until now, Google Translate’s use of artificial neural networks has been limited, says Charina Choi, a company spokesperson. For the most part, its algorithms analysed text word by word, learning to associate corresponding words in different languages by scouring millions of existing translations, such as in documents from the United Nations or the European Parliament. The NMTS also learns by analysing existing translations; as it does so, it tweaks connections between artificial neurons in a way that will improve its performance. But it analyses sentences by first breaking up each word into ‘word segments’, an idea that came from team member Mike Schuster, also at Google in Mountain View, who had employed it in speech-recognition software. “Somehow, in some representation inside the neural network, the segments can combine to represent meaning,” says Le. This could be similar to the way that neural networks perform visual tasks such as face recognition: they start from the individual pixels in an image and work up through increasingly complex features such as edges, geometric patterns and so on. The same neural network that analysed the text then produces a translation. To improve speed, the company runs the system on computer chips that it designed specifically for machine learning. AlphaGo, the program that beat a top human player at the game of Go earlier this year, used similar hardware. Performance verdict To evaluate the translation system’s performance, the Google researchers took sentences from Wikipedia and from news articles and put NMTS-made translations (between a handful of different language pairs) side by side with corresponding ones made by the company’s old system and by human translators. The team then had human evaluators score the quality of the translations in a blind test. Chinese-to-English translation, which is notoriously difficult, showed marked improvements, but still lagged compared to the algorithm's translations among Indo-European languages. For some other language pairs, the accuracy of the NMTS approached that of human translators, although the authors caution that the significance of the test was limited by its sample of well-crafted, simple sentences. Schmidhuber thinks that machines will only be able to truly match or beat humans at translation once they are able to combine different sensory inputs. “Today, they only see sentences such as ‘the cat fell from the tree’,” Schmidhuber says. “In the future, they will also see videos of cats falling from trees, and they will control robots that can see, hear, move and manipulate objects, and feel pain through pain sensors, and relate their experiences to texts.” Journal name: Nature DOI: doi:10.1038/nature.2016.20696 References Wu, Y. et al.

And while it hasn’t really had much development in the years since its debut, that might be about to change. Although we don’t know for sure, it seems likely that Google is planning an update of some kind. In a tweet sent out late on September 26, Google stated simply two dates: “29.09.16 – 01.10.16,” followed by a darkened GIF of a Google Cardboard. 29.09.16 – 01.10.16 #GoogleCardboard pic.twitter.com/HPE3BlcjNV — Google UK (@GoogleUK) September 27, 2016 Is that a new design we’re getting our first look of? Is Google going to launch hardware upgrades for existing Cardboards to let users implement positional tracking or motion controllers? While the simplest change would be for Google to come up with a new, more efficient, or sturdier way to mount a user’s smartphone and hold it to their face, since the Google Cardboard is in essence just a housing for a smartphone, any changes to it are not going to be too drastic in terms of the experience. Related: Everything you need to know about Google Daydream It’s also somewhat surprising that Google is announcing a Cardboard development in the coming few days, as it has a large press event taking place on October 4, where you would expect any big news, especially about VR, to be debuted. We’re also cautiously optimistic that we’ll hear from Google about its much rumored Daydream platform at some point in the coming weeks, so a combined virtual reality announcement with that would have seemed more likely. cardboardbackgroundMore It may be that Google Cardboard is getting its own announcement, though what it will involve is anyone’s guess. A freeze frame and some Photoshop trickery (shown above) reveal the GIF’s background to be some sort of musical recording, though how that is relevant remains to be seen. Perhaps it will be a software announcement. It was only a couple of weeks ago that the iOS version of Google’s Cardboard Camera application — which makes taking panoramic, VR shots easier — was launched, so perhaps this event will see more cross-platform support.

Google behavior makes reaching amicable agreement between the company and the Russian Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS) unlikely, although it is legally possible, Head of FAS Igor Artemyev told reporters on Tuesday. Read also Russian watchdog may start fining Google twice a month "Theoretically, anything is possible, but in recent years the company’s behavior makes me think that reaching amicable agreement is nearly impossible," Artemyev said. Artemyev noted that the American company is delaying implementation of agency’s regulations by issuing counter claims. Artemyev said earlier that FAS would fine Google if the company delays enforcing regulations of the service. "If there are delays in the process, we will gather every two weeks and issue new fines. This will go on until the final victory end and the court’s decision. This is normal," he said. Earlier the Russian Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS) said it would fine Google for failure to comply with the order to eliminate violations of the antimonopoly legislation in time. "If the requirement is not met, a non-compliance penalty will be set, starting from 500,000 rubles ($7.721) and then it double. We will fine as much as necessary for non-compliance with the regulations, until they are fulfilled," Head of the Antimonopoly Service Igor Artemyev said. Read also Official sees chances for Google to reach settlement agreement with Russian watchdog Google to be fined if fails to comply with regulations in time Google files new claim against Russian antimonopoly watchdog to Moscow Arbitration Court Google sues Russia's Federal Antimonopoly Service Moscow Arbitration Court rejects Google's appeal against FAS case Kremlin advisor calls for fining Google every day Deadline for enforcing Google regulation should not be moved, Artemyev noted. "I believe that we should not move it. They had more than enough time," he said. According to the agency’s statement, FAS refused extending the deadline for Google. "The decision took into account that 10 months ago the period for performing the requirements have been already extended on Google's request for 1 month, until December 18, 2015 - and for the same reasons: because of the need for a "significant amount of work"," FAS said. The agency noted that the content of the new request presented no evidence of a significant change in circumstances relating to the execution of orders. In addition, the petition was filed in violation of the terms established by the law on protection of competition. FAS is currently preparing to conduct an administrative investigation into the failure to comply with the ruling.   {{item.group_date}} {{item.suffix?", "+item.suffix:""}} Show more Share Companies Google Top News November 18, 15:20 Putin says Russia seeks to maintain world’s strategic balance of power November 18, 15:20 November 18, 15:44 Russian premier: Russia regains status of leading player on world’s food market November 18, 15:44 November 18, 16:04 Deputy PM says agriculture is engine of Russian economic growth November 18, 16:04 November 18, 15:53 PM Medvedev’s coffee joke may add ‘Russiano’ to country’s beverage menu November 18, 15:53 In other media Реклама Photo 18 Russian Arctic, the history of exploration 6 Sales of iPhone 7 officially start in Russia 5 First international flight arrives from Minsk at Moscow's newest airport Infographics Russia's gas pipelines to Europe by 2018 Gas agreement signed by Russia, Ukraine and the EU Altai gas pipeline Economical sanctions against Russia Most read Now Today This week 1 Russian Army to receive missiles with warheads based on new physical principles 2 Russian expert on accuracy of Kh-101 cruise missiles used against terrorists in Syria 3 Russia's 'Night Hunter': from maiden flight to fighting ISIS 4 Russia's Tupolev-95MSM bomber delivers first-ever strike on mission to Syria 5 US Embassy concerned by Russia’s decision to block LinkedIn 6 Obama calls Russia ‘military superpower,’ important partner 7 'Saint Petersburg' submarine launches cruise missile in Barents Sea 1 Russia's Tupolev-95MSM bomber delivers first-ever strike on mission to Syria 2 Russia's 'Night Hunter': from maiden flight to fighting ISIS 3 Russian bombers deliver strike at terrorist strongholds in Syria — Defense Ministry 4 Obama calls Russia ‘military superpower,’ important partner 5 Family of Russian officer killed in Syria writes letter to Hollande 6 Russian Army to receive missiles with warheads based on new physical principles 7 Russian diplomat says Lavrov, Kerry to discuss US ‘shocking’ treatment of RT television 1 Russian forces launch large-scale operation against terrorists in Syria 2 MIG-29 fighter jet crashes into Mediterranean off Syrian coast 3 Russia's Tupolev-95MSM bomber delivers first-ever strike on mission to Syria 4 Russia declines to ratify International Criminal Court Statute 5 Obama calls Russia ‘military superpower,’ important partner 6 Russian bombers deliver strike at terrorist strongholds in Syria — Defense Ministry 7 Putin sets task to ensure reliable protection of Russian forces in Syria TOP STORIES US presidential election 2016 Conflict in Syria Russia's defense industry Oil & Gas Industry Space programs Реклама News World Russian Politics & Diplomacy Business & Economy Military & Defense Science & Space Society & Culture Sport Press Review Sections Tags Media Press Releases Infographics About us TASS TODAY AGENCY NEWS TASS HISTORY MANAGEMENT CONTACTS Services TASS-PHOTO TASS-ONLINE TASS Beta-version.

Waarom je Google Allo wilt gebruiken De reacties op de nieuwste communicatie-app van Google zijn verdeeld. Hier lees je wat de reviews je niet vertellen. Mike Elgan Internationaal 27 september 2016 Delen         0 Reacties Bewaren Moet je Allo van Google installeren? Jazeker! Als berichtenapp is het nieuwe Allo van Google niet geweldig. Om kort te gaan, de functionaliteit onderscheidt zich nauwelijks van welk app dan ook die al jaren bestaat. Maar er is een reden waarom je Allo elke dag zou moeten gebruiken: artificial intelligence. There are dozens of messaging apps, and each has its own unique list of features. For example, iPhone users may feel compelled to choose between Apple's iMessage, which recently gained the ability to run iMessage apps, and Allo for iOS. So for the sake of understanding Google's new messaging service, let's talk about how iMessage compares with Allo. Why iMessage is better than Allo Apple's iMessage service and Messages apps are generally more elegant, polished and appealing to use than Google's Allo. A range of recently launched features make iMessage fun, such as "invisible ink," "gentle," "loud" and "slam" effects. Allo, on the other hand, has only the ability to make text larger or smaller, a feature Google calls WhisperShout. (You use WhisperShout by dragging your finger up or down from the send button.) Mac users have a desktop version of Messages, which integrates seamlessly into the mobile versions. I use iMessage via my MacBook Pro, iPad and iPhone. Unfortunately, you can use Allo on just one phone. Strong encryption for messages between two iMessage users is default and automatic, making iMessages more secure because no explicit action is required to gain full benefit of the end-to-end encryption. Edward Snowden says: Don't use Allo. With Allo, users need to choose end-to-end encryption by using an Incognito mode. Google had previously said it would store only some user messages on its servers, but changed its tune by launch time, saying the company will store all messages unless actively deleted by users or initially sent in Incognito mode. In reality, that means most users will leave all messages on Google's servers forever, and those conversations will be available to law enforcement, the NSA and possibly hackers some day. On the plus side, Google uses the Signal Protocol for end-to-end encryption while two Allo users have an Incognito conversation, which is very good encryption. Also: While you can manually delete conversations you have with other people, you can't delete conversations you have with Google's Assistant. Because stored data is necessary for Assistant customization, Google doesn't give you Assistant or Smart Reply features in Incognito Mode and doesn't let you delete Assistant conversation data, to the best of my knowledge. Finally, Apple's entire approach to communication is very clear, while Google's is muddled. Apple has three properties: email (Mail), Facetime (video and voice calling) and iMessage (messaging). Nobody's confused about any of this. Google, on the other hand, has two cloud mail clients (Gmail and Inbox), three voice and/or video apps (Google Voice, Hangouts and Duo) and two messaging apps (Hangouts and Allo). And most users aren't sure which, if any, are defunct or soon to be phased out. Why Allo is better than iMessage While you can achieve the equivalent of ephemeral messages with iMessage by installing one of several apps, the option for self-destructing messages is built in to Allo, but only in Incognito Mode. When you enter into Incognito Mode, the default is set for the message to self-destruct in one hour, but you can change that to any of several times within a range of five seconds to one week. You can also set the message to never expire. Google Assistant will do searches within a chat. Apple's iMessage is for Apple hardware and operating systems only. But Google's Allo runs on both Apple platforms and Android. So iPhone and Android users can use Allo to chat with each other without resorting to SMS.

The company is reëngineering its translation service after Google researchers invented a system that is significantly more accurate. In a competition that pitted the new software against human translators, it came close to matching the fluency of humans for some languages, such as when translating from English to Spanish. Google has already begun rolling out the new system for translations from Chinese to English (see examples showing the improvement). The company expects to replace its current translation system altogether. Making it easier to read Web pages or exchange messages across language barriers could help people around the globe communicate with one another. Google researcher Quoc Le says Google’s big translation upgrade could also lead to improved relations between people and machines. A man uses Google's translation app in Paris in 2014. Ideas at work in the new translation system could help software learn to do harder things such as read Wikipedia and then answer complex questions about the world, says Le, who was one of MIT Technology Review’s 35 Innovators Under 35 in 2014. Google’s new translation system was built using a technique known as deep learning, which uses networks of math functions loosely inspired by studies of mammalian brains (see “10 Breakthrough Technologies 2013: Deep Learning”). It triggered the recent flood of investment in artificial intelligence by producing striking progress in areas such as image and speech recognition. Since 2014, researchers at Google have been investigating how deep learning might also deliver a shot in the arm to translation. Le says the latest results show that time has now come. A paper released by Google includes results from translating from English into Spanish, French, and Chinese, and from each of those languages into English. When people fluent in two languages were asked to compare the work of Google’s new system against that of human translators, they sometimes couldn’t see much difference between them. Participants used a scale from 0 to 6 to rate the fluency of translations of 500 sentences taken randomly from Wikipedia or news articles. For English to Spanish, Google’s new system scored 5.43 on average, not far off the 5.55 given to human translations. Google’s new system also scored close to human translators for French to English. The old system was not close to human performance. In Google’s tests, humans scored the new system between 64 and 87 percent better than the previous one. Le says the impressive results came from Google’s researchers making their neural-network-powered translation system much more independent of its human designers. Both the old and new systems learn to translate by looking at collections of documents that had been translated into different languages. But the old system was designed to use a particular recipe to translate text. It had components created to learn certain things, for example how to reorder the words in a sentence in different languages. Google’s new system isn’t given a recipe and figures out its own path to reliably convert text from one language to another. It even reads and creates text without bothering with the concept of words. Instead, the software works out its own way to break up text into smaller fragments that often look nonsensical and don’t generally correspond to the phonemes of speech. That independence makes it hard for even the system’s creators to understand what it’s doing, but the results speak for themselves, says Le. “It can be unsettling, but we've tested it in a lot of places and it just works,” he says. Google’s translation fillip doesn’t come out of the blue. Researchers in academia and industry have recently become convinced that neural networks can allow new progress in making software understand language, says Lane Schwartz, an associate professor in linguistics at the University of Illinois. How much progress Le and others can expect toward software that displays some ability to truly understand language is unclear. Aping the complexity and power of the way we communicate has been a target of artificial intelligence researchers for decades, but successes have been scarce (see “AI’s Language Problem”). This story was updated to remove reference to results from translating Portuguese, which were not present in the final version of Google's paper.

Not entirely unlike one of several 3rd-party launchers with circular icons (as we saw earlier this month), this view of the smaller Pixel smartphone shows how the device will present an extremely straightforward way of using one’s phone as an information source and app launcher. Google’s “G” icon is also quite prevalent without requiring Google’s full word brand mark to take up any more room than it needs to. The images of the Pixel seen above and below were illustrated using one image from Venturebeat. What we’ve done here is to re-create each of the elements on the screen with Google’s own Android icons (available to all developers and so forth for app development). For lettering, Google’s Roboto font for Android sufficed – and is likely the font being used in the first place. We’ve also utilized the wallpapers leaked with the Pixel Launcher from earlier this month to show potential different looks for this launcher page. In the gallery below are several images as created by 3D-illustrator Simon Paturel – as seen in our earlier article about a touchpad. The rumored touchpad – which we’re not entirely certain will come to fruition – is said to rest under the glass panels at the back of the Pixel and Pixel XL. This pad would, if delivered, control the desktop OS edition of Android, AKA Andromeda, something very likely extremely similar to what’s available on some Chromebooks already today. Ready for action. The details we’ve gathered before today and delivered below round off a couple of rather decent phones, very likely going by the names Pixel and Pixel XL. Should have called it Mega-Pixel, Google. Silly. Pixel (Sailfish) (The Smaller) • Display: 5-inch 1080p AMOLED • Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 • RAM: 4GB (3.7 benchmarked) • Internal Storage: 32GB, 64GB • Camera: 12MP back-facing camera with 4K video recording • Front-Camera: 8-megapixel • Battery: 2770-mAh • Connectivity: USB-C, Bluetooth 4.2, Wi-Fi, 4G LTE, 3G The information in spec-listing form above and below should not be accepted as fact until Google reveals these devices at the October 4th, 2016 event. That’s where we expect a whole lot more action on the Android front (and beyond). Pixel XL (Marlin) (The Larger) • Display: 5.5-inch 2K 2560 x 1440 AMOLED • Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 • RAM: 4GB (3.7 benchmarked) • Internal Storage: 32GB, 128GB • Camera: 12MP back-facing camera with 4K video recording • Front-Camera: 8-megapixel • Battery: 3450-mAh • Connectivity: USB-C, Bluetooth 4.2, Wi-Fi, 4G LTE, 3G In the display images shown above and below, two different forms of delivery can be seen. One is a blurred edition, the other has more clarity. It’s likely Google will allow either – especially if there’s no separate lock screen. What we’d really like to see is the Android promise fulfilled, at last. By that I mean a full-on consumer launch of a Google phone or phones alongside other hardware whose software will be completely controlled by the company. At Alphabet’s Q2 2016 quarterly earnings call, CEO of Google Sundar Pichai made it all clear: “We realize a lot of computing innovations happen at the intersection of hardware and software. And as we are building ecosystems and broad platforms, we need a way to drive them forward, and so that’s the context in which we do.” “There are areas where we have done it very seriously, like Chromecast is a great example,” said Pichai. “You know, we now have over 30 million Chromecast devices sold. And, you know, that’s an example of where we invest deeply. And especially as newer areas emerge, like Google Home, we want our ability to put the best experience possible in front of our users and guide the ecosystem. So that’s how we think about it.” We’ll be at Google’s big event on the 4th of October, ready to bring the world all the hands-on and preview action straight from the source.

Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.26pm EDT 16:26 85 min: Good play down the right flank by Mario Hernandes, who gives the ball and goes, picks up the return pass and gets in behind Ben Davies. He plays the ball diagonally across the face of goal - is it a shot or a cross to Lacina Traore? - but it fizzes wide of the far post.

Finnish reader Kári Tulinius has been watching the action: “The Finnish equivalent to the BBC decided to show that game,” he says. “I can’t share any nuggets of wisdom from the commentators, one of whom is Jari Litmanen, since my rudimentary Finnish doesn’t allow me to understand anything more complicated than so-and-so gets a yellow or that guy sent in a cross. But my own eyes tell me that it’s been a game played at pace with no clear cut chances. You get a feeling that one good chance is all either team needs, and it might settle the game. Meanwhile, the Stade Louis II is half-full at best. You’d think that they could get some late-season holiday goers interested in a Champions League game, but no.” The Spurs fans show their support in Moscow.

Close, but no cigar. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.59pm EDT 15:59 57 min: Vincent Janssen picks out a Dele Alli run into space, but running down a blind alley through the left of the CSKA penalty area, the Spurs midfielder is left with little option but to whack the ball off Ignasievich’s arm and appeal for a penalty. He’s forced to settle for a corner, from which nothing comes.

Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.55pm EDT 15:55 51 min: Ben Davies gets a crucial block as Zoran Tosic is teed up from the left and shoots from just inside the Spurs penalty area. The deflection takes the ball over the bar for a CSKA corner, from which nothing comes. Moments previously, Son had got in behind the CSKA defence, but allowed Schennikov to get goalside of the in-form Spurs man to prevent him from shooting. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.52pm EDT 15:52 50 min: Son and Lamela have swapped wings since the interval, with Son now operating on the right and Lamela on the left.

When Burnley came up from the Championship three seasons ago, Trippier was their main assist-merchant from the right-back position. As I recall, he provided 15 or 16 assists from the right flank.

They’ve played well enough against a CSKA side that are content to sit back and let them have possession, but their final ball has been less than incisive and a long-range Dele Alli shot from distance that thumped the cross-bar was their best chance of scoring. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.30pm EDT 15:30 44 min: Some more neat play around the fringes of the CSKA penalty area, this time involving Eriksen, Son and Ben Davies. Again the final ball is found wanting, with Davies supplying the excessively leaden touch that enables CSKA to clear on this occasion.

Cade Metz Business Date of Publication: 09.27.16. 09.27.16 Time of Publication: 1:00 pm. 1:00 pm An Infusion of AI Makes Google Translate More Powerful Than Ever Google Last March, a computer built by a team of Google engineers beat one of the world’s top players at the ancient game of Go. The match between AlphaGo and Korean grandmaster Lee Sedol was so exhilarating, so upsetting, and so unexpectedly powerful, we turned it into a cover story for the magazine. On a Friday in late April, we were about an hour away from sending this story to the printer when I got an email. According to the email, Lee had won all five matches—and all against top competition—since his loss to AlphaGo. Even as it surpasses human talents, AI can also pull humans to new heights—a theme that ran through our magazine story. After playing AlphaGo, Lee said the machine opened his eyes to new ways of playing the ancient game, and indeed, it had. We needed to get his latest wins into the story. But we also had a problem: the source of this news was in Korean, and no one in our office spoke the language. We ran it the through Google Translate, but it spat out some English that didn’t quite make sense. We had to find a second source. We did, just in time. And today, as Google rolls out a new incarnation of its translation software, it comes with a certain irony. Online translation couldn’t help our story on the new wave in artificial intelligence, but the new wave in artificial intelligence is improving online translation. The technology that underpinned AlphaGo—deep neural networks—is now playing a very big role on Google Translate. Modeled after the way neurons connect in the human brain, deep neural networks are the same breed of AI technology that identifies commands spoken into Android phones and recognizes people in photos posted to Facebook, and the promise is that it will reinvent machine translation in much the same way. Google says that with certain languages, its new system—dubbed Google Neural Machine Translation, or GNMT—reduces errors by 60 percent. For now, it only translates from Chinese into English—perhaps a key translation pair in Google’s larger ambitions. But the company plans to roll it out for the more than 10,000 language pairs now handled by Google Translate. “We can train this whole system in an end-to-end fashion. That makes it much easier for [Google] to focus on reducing the final error rate.” says Google engineer Mike Schuster, one of the lead authors on the paper Google released on the tech today and a member of the Google Brain team, which oversees the company’s AI work. “What we have now is not perfect. But you can tell that it is much, much better.” All the big Internet giants are moving in the same direction, training deep neural nets using translations gathered from across the Internet. Neural nets already drive small parts of the best online translation systems, and the big players know that deep learning is the way to do it all. “We’re racing against everyone,” says Peter Lee, who oversees a portion of the AI work at Microsoft Research. “We’re all on the verge.” They’re all moving to this method not only because they can improve machine translation, but because they can improve it in a much faster and much broader way. “The key thing about neural network models is that they are able to generalize better from the data,” says Microsoft researcher Arul Menezes. “With the previous model, no matter how much data we threw at them, they failed to make basic generalizations. At some point, more data was just not making them any better.” For machine translation, Google is using a form of deep neural network called an LSTM, short for long short-term memory. An LSTM can retain information in both the short and the long term—kind of like your own memory. That allows it learn in more complex ways. As it analyzes a sentence, it can remember the beginning as it gets to the end. That’s different from Google’s previous translation method, Phrase-Based Machine Translation, which breaks sentences into individual words and phrases. The new method looks at the entire collection of words. Of course, researchers have been trying to get LSTM to work on translation for years. The trouble with LSTMs for machine translation was that they couldn’t operate at the pace we have all come to expect from online service. Google finally got it to work at speed—fast enough to run a service across the Internet at large. “Without doing lots of engineering work and algorithmic work to improve the models,” says Microsoft researcher Jacob Devlin, “the speed is very much slower than traditional models.” According to Schuster, Google has achieved this speed partly through changes to the LSTMs themselves. Deep neural networks consists of layer after layer of mathematical calculations—linear algebra—with the results of one layer feeding into the next. One trick Google uses is to start the calculations for the second layer before the first layer is finished—and so on. But Schuster also says that much of the speed is driven by Google’s tensor processing units, chips the company specifically built for AI. With TPUs, Schuster says, the same sentence that once took ten seconds to translate via this LSTM model now takes 300 milliseconds. Like the other big Internet companies, Google trains its neural nets using graphics processing units, chips designed to render images visual applications like games. Its new machine translation system trains for about a week on about 100 GPU cards, each equipped with a few hundred individual chips. Then the specialized chips execute the model. Google is unique in building its own chip for this task. But others are moving in a similar direction. Microsoft uses programmable chips called FPGAs to execute neural neural networks, and companies like Baidu are exploring other types of silicon. All these companies are racing towards the same future—working not just to improve machine translation, but to build AI systems that can understand and respond to natural human language. As Google’s new Allo messaging app shows, these “chat bots” are still flawed. But neural networks are rapidly changing what’s possible. “None of this is solved,” Schuster says. “But there is a constant upward tick.” Or as Google says the Chinese would say: “Yǒu yīgè bùduàn xiàngshàng gōu.” Go Back to Top.

Many want to know if it is fully rolled out - it doesn't seem so. Many want to know if it only started to roll out on Friday or if it started earlier. As we covered then, we saw stronger signs of a Penguin roll out a day or two before and then reported on many Google updates in the month of September. All went unconfirmed. John Mueller at Google wrote on Twitter that Google doesn't have a "start date" to announce for Penguin's launch. He said: @dr_pete @methode afaik we don't have a start date to announce. not all visible changes are penguin, of course.— John Mueller (@JohnMu) September 26, 2016 So I then asked did it roll out before September 23rd and Gary Illyes from Google asked, if it really matters: @rustybrick @JohnMu @dr_pete what does it matter really— Gary Illyes (@methode) September 26, 2016 If I had to guess, the rollout started a few days before the official launch but we saw signs of Google testing it even earlier. I honestly have no inside information, so that is just a guess. Forum discussion at Twitter. Prev Story Next story Tweet This Previous story: No, Google Won't Send Manual Actions Notices For Penguin Penalties   Comments: The Truth 09/27/2016 12:23 pm Once again, anyone with half a brain knew that penguin started on Sept 1. All the people that said it wasn't Penguin including the "Penguin Recovery Specialist" need to stop waiting on Google to tell you what they are doing. Open your eyes and look at the data. RollerCoaster 09/27/2016 12:49 pm If if was rolled out Sept 1st, or 23rd, does that really matter? Still, not one single recovery case reported... Asad 09/27/2016 01:00 pm I have two sites which have moved up much in the past day. Other commenters on other articles are saying they are getting better today too. Lala 09/27/2016 01:00 pm it started on 20th tuesday stevemeb 09/27/2016 02:04 pm Does anyone believe what Google says anymore? No one has any evidence to support the case that Penguin was rolled out. You can not take a Google's word for it. This update is one of Google best PR scams i have seen it has web masters exactly where Google wants them, headless chickens Dude 09/27/2016 03:46 pm The day Penguin updates are reported Google's stock hit's a new all time high.

Snapchat Spectacles Why Snapchat's Spectacles can succeed where Google Glass failed Glassholes, rejoice! Your hopes and dreams are about to be fulfilled by a $129 pair of video-recording Spectacles that its creator calls a "toy." But while they are going to be super-fun to play with, Snap Inc.'s Spectacles are a serious brand extension for the company that created ephemeral visual conversation. SO LONG, SNAPCHAT, WE HARDLY KNEW YE Snapchat has just renamed itself Snap Inc., and Evan Spiegel, its 26-year-old CEO, has a well-reasoned argument for the change. He wants to free Snapchat from the shackles of your smartphone camera lens. The company's website says, "Snap Inc. is a camera company. We believe that reinventing the camera represents our greatest opportunity to improve the way people live and communicate. Our products empower people to express themselves, live in the moment, learn about the world, and have fun together." Like previous versions of video-recording eyewear, Spectacles look like a pair of glasses. They have a video camera with a 115-degree-angle lens positioned right next to your eyes -- so every video is shot from your point of view. But unlike a GoPro or your smartphone camera, you don't need to experience the world while holding a camera in front of your face. You simply tap the side of your Spectacles to initiate a 10-second video recording, and it is automatically transferred to the Memories section of your Snapchat app, where you can decide to use it or delete it at your convenience. Snap's Spectacles were built by Steve Horowitz, the former engineering SVP at Motorola and mobile product veteran who joined Snapchat back in early 2015, Recode reports. ARE WE READY FOR NEW VIDEO RECORDING BEHAVIORS? The ability to use your hands while recording what you were seeing was the only cool thing about Google Glass. Sadly, for Glass users (ultimately known as Glassholes for how pretentious it looked to wear them in public), Google did not provide compelling or emotionally satisfying software to process or distribute the stills and videos you took with Glass. The purpose-built design of Spectacles for Snapchat solves that problem handily. Snap Inc. hasn't released much more information about Spectacles, except to say that they will be available sometime this fall. I can't wait -- although to Evan Spiegel's point, most of us will only be able to "play" with them. Even though a ring around the Spectacles camera illuminates to warn subjects that they are being recorded, past a "certain age," you won't just be considered pretentious; you will have evolved all the way to creepy. NEW VIDEO GRAMMAR FOR VIDEO CONVERSATIONS VVS (vertical video syndrome) was a thing a few years back. Old schoolers had a hard enough time understanding why almost every smartphone camera picture was shot in portrait mode. The idea that people would purposely shoot video with a portrait (vertical) aspect ratio invoked bar arguments about Oxford commas, Rock being the "devil's music" and the "death of the English language" due to social-media abbreviations and initialisms, ROTFL. But over the past few years, something interesting has happened. Not only have vertical portraiture and videography become commonplace, the camera position (arm fully extended for a selfie, or bent at the elbow for rear-facing image-making) and the ergonomically-imposed compositional choices have created some new rules of video grammar. Snapchat was a powerful driver of this evolution. Spectacles records images with a 115-degree-angle lens in a circular format. This technological decision will make images appear more closely related to the way your eyes naturally perceive the real world. Which raises the question, "Will this new image-capture format and the accompanying 10-second duration spawn yet another video grammar revolution?" It's way too early to tell, but if Spectacles are treated more like a Snapchat extension and less like a toy, it won't be long before music videos and TV commercials start mimicking or simply using them. THE SINGULARITY ISN'T THAT NEAR Google Glass failed for so many reasons (not the least of which was its $2,000-ish price point), it is impossible to make real comparisons here. But one overwhelming issue with Glass will also be an overwhelming issue with Spectacles. Lots of normal people are going to feel they invade their privacy. While 2040 is the median accepted date for Ray Kurzweil supplicants who believe that humans and machines will evolve into transhumans, most people are just going to be bugged that someone has the ability to make an unfortunate video of them without their knowledge or consent. There's really no way around this. Some objections will be cultural, others will be behavioral, but either way, general acceptance of pseudo-transhuman-camera-people is going to be a heavy lift. KUDOS TO SNAP INC. Evan Spiegel is a product designer's product designer. And his attitude about getting Spectacles to market quickly "because it's fun" should be an object lesson for every CEO. Kudos to the entire team at Snap Inc. Oh, and BTW, I'd like to order 50 pairs to give out as holiday gifts. Shelly Palmer is President & CEO of Palmer Advanced Media.

 Google's self-driving car gets in worst accident yet BI Intelligence Sep. 27, 2016, 1:32 PM 4,453 facebook linkedin twitter email print This story was delivered to BI Intelligence IoT Briefing subscribers. To learn more and subscribe, please click here.  A line of Lexus SUVs equipped with Google self-driving sensors await test riders during a media preview.Reuters/Elijah Nouvelage See Also Obama warns Trump: 'If you're not serious' about the presidency, 'you probably won't be there very long' Nexar's new app uses vehicle network and AI to avoid accidents This fully autonomous AI company could be crucial for self-driving cars One of Google’s self-driving cars was recently in a major accident, according to 9to5Google. The crash occurred in Mountain View, CA, when a commercial van with a human driver ran a red light and crashed into Google’s autonomous Lexus. While no one involved in the incident was hurt, this was the worst crash one of the company’s self-driving cars has been involved in. However, initial reports indicate that the crash was caused by human error, rather than a malfunction of the Google car. While Google and other companies that have invested in autonomous driving technologies insist that the technologies are safe, these companies face a perception problem, at the very least, that they must overcome if consumers are to opt to use this cutting-edge technology. In particular, Tesla has been at the center of self-driving scrutiny after one of its cars was involved in a fatal crash while Autopilot was engaged. However, self-driving car crashes are relatively uncommon when compared with the amount of crashes caused by human error. Still, companies that want to fully monetize their self-driving initiatives will have to overcome the stigma that self-driving cars are unsafe. John Greenough, senior research analyst for BI Intelligence, has compiled a detailed report on self-driving cars that examines the major strides automakers and tech companies have made to overcome the barriers currently preventing fully autonomous cars from hitting the market. Further, the report examines global survey results showing where fully autonomous cars are highly desired. BI Intelligence Here are some key takeaways from the report: Three barriers have been preventing fully autonomous cars from hitting the road: 1) high technological component prices; 2) varying degrees of consumer trust in the technology; and 3) relatively nonexistent regulations. However, in the past six months, there have been many advances in overcoming these barriers. Technology has been improving as new market entrants find innovative ways to expand on existing fully autonomous car technology. As a result, the price of the components required for fully autonomous cars has been dropping. Consumer trust in fully autonomous vehicle technology has increased in the past two years. California became the first US state to propose regulations. California's regulations stipulate that a fully autonomous car must have a driver behind the wheel at all times, discouraging Google's and Uber's idea of a driverless taxi system. In full, the report: Examines consumer trust in fully autonomous vehicles Identifies technological advancements that have been made in the industry Analyzes the cost of fully autonomous technology and identifies how cost is being reduced Explains the current regulations surrounding fully autonomous cars To get your copy of this invaluable guide, choose one of these options: Subscribe to an ALL-ACCESS Membership with BI Intelligence and gain immediate access to this report AND over 100 other expertly researched deep-dive reports, subscriptions to all of our daily newsletters, and much more. >> START A MEMBERSHIP Purchase the report and download it immediately from our research store. >> BUY THE REPORT The choice is yours.

Multimedia Today's Paper Topics ePaper WealthCheck SEARCH Follow Home News Markets Companies Money & Banking Economy Info-tech Opinion Specials Portfolio Catalyst BLink Social Media Computers & Laptops Mobiles & Tablets Other Gadgets Google to roll out Wi-Fi hotspots in India Our Bureau   ·   print   ·   T+  ·   T- Tweet AP Google, in partnership with RailTel, is now offering Wi-Fi services in over 50 railway stations, being accessed by 3.5 million people each month Adds new features to enable access even in poor connectivity New Delhi, September 27:   In a bid to make itself more relevant to a larger section of users in India, Internet giant Google on Tuesday announced a slew of new initiatives aimed at improving connectivity and making its products available even to those without access to high speed data network. Google announced five new products including a new version of YouTube that allows users to watch videos smoothly even in poor connectivity and new data-saving features in Google Chrome for mobile. Google also unveiled a project to roll out Wi-Fi hotspots in partnership with telecom operators. Caesar Sengupta, Vice-President of Next Billion Users, said: “Our goal has not just been to help more Indians get online — but also to help Indians create the online experience they want; one that serves their needs and enables them to have an impact on the entire world. So we have been thinking about how to build products and services for this wave of new users — products that work for any level of connectivity, in local Indian languages, and across the devices that are most frequently used in India.” YouTube Go is a brand new app designed and built from the ground up with insights from India. It not only allows users to save and watch videos smoothly even in poor connectivity, it also gives them transparency and control over how much data they consume on videos, allowing them to preview videos first and choose the video’s file size before they save it offline to watch later. They can also share videos easily with friends and family nearby, without using any data at all. Soon testers in India will be able to use YouTube Go before the the product becomes more widely available.Allo to go local Google will also launch a preview of the Google Assistant in Hindi by the end of 2016 inside the brand new Allo messaging app. The Google Assistant lets users have a conversation with Google, which can help them get things done. Inspired by the success of the partnership with RailTel and Indian Railways to provide Wi-Fi at railway stations in India, the internet giant announced a new Wi-Fi platform called Google Station. This new platform will work with partners to roll out Wi-Fi hotspots, offering carriers, system integrators (SIs), and venues an easy way to set up internet access points. Google in partnership with RailTel is now offering Wi-Fi services in over 50 railway stations. This is being accessed by 3.5 million people each month. Sengupta also announced fast browsing in Google Play for people on 2G and other low-bandwidth connections. Fast browsing uses preloading on Wi-Fi to load the most popular parts of Google Play quickly. And when a user on a low-bandwidth connection chooses to install an app, Google Play will offer a new “Wait for Wi-Fi” option where the app will only install when the phone next connects to Wi-Fi. A technology which reduces the amount of data Chrome uses on Android mobile devices, computers, and Chromebooks — will now support MP4 videos, saving up to over two-thirds (67%) of video data. Chrome on Android will now also automatically optimize pages to their essentials when 2G-like networks are detected. These simplified pages load up to 2X faster, saving more than 90 per cent of data usage.Chrome upgraded Chrome on Android’s new Download feature will now allow users to save web pages, videos, music, or pictures. Downloaded items can be easily accessed in Chrome’s new downloads tab, even when offline. And if users go offline before the download is complete, the process will automatically resume next time they’re connected. Rajan Anandan, Vice-President, India and South East Asia, said “Our vision is to make India a global hub of innovation and produce high quality mobile developers who will build not just for India but for the world.” (This article was published on September 27, 2016) Related NEWS Google launches new services on its birthday Google Station launched in India for Internet in public places TOPICS arts, culture and entertainment | internet | Get more of your favourite news delivered to your inbox SEND MY NEWS Please enter your email.

(ANF) Stock Is Beyond All Hope It’s Time to Rethink How We Value Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO) Stock This Is the Best Thing to Happen to Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) In a While View All Posts Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) remains the odds-on favorite buyer for Twitter Inc (NYSE:TWTR). Not just because GOOGL can afford to do a deal, but because that pairing makes the most sense. Source: Freestocks via Unsplash Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS) has now thrown its hat into the ring of companies reportedly mulling a Twitter buyout, followed by reports today that Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) was joining the fray. The race is heating up, and it’s getting crowded. And yet, in all the hoopla surrounding Disney — in addition to whether salesforce.com, inc. (NYSE:CRM) could even afford Twitter — one important reality has been buried: Alphabet Inc is the right buyer for Twitter. And yet, a merger isn’t an outright slam dunk for the value of GOOGL stock. Why GOOGL Should Buy TWTR There are several reasons owners of GOOGL stock might want to see Alphabet scoop up Twitter while it can (provided the price per share of TWTR needed to make it happen isn’t outrageous). But the most superficially logical one is also the most correct one: Alphabet doesn’t have a social networking presence, and Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB) is on the verge of turning its social media venue into a modest alternative to Google. 7 Debt-Free Stocks That Will Survive the Coming Bear Market Not everyone realizes it yet, but Facebook’s search tool isn’t just a means of finding other Facebook users. Late last year, FB began indexing posts, and now adds those posts to its search results. More recently, it added a “Buy Now” button to Messenger, and it’s no big secret that Facebook dominates the messaging space despite Google’s efforts to attract users to Google Hangouts and its new Allo. Let’s also not forget Facebook is stepping up its game as a digital video venue. None of those things in and of themselves pose an immediate threat to Google. All of them, however, open the door to an effort that could turn into a threat that slowly chips away at Google’s relevance to the average internet user. That’s not to say Twitter in its current format could upend Facebook as the king of social networking, but most GOOGL investors have little doubt that Alphabet could tweak Twitter enough to turn it into an outright destination rather than a mere diversion. Let’s also not forget that Twitter serves up a ton of detailed data, not just about its users, but about what’s hot on the web right now. Google loves data, as it can be converted into improved targeted ads. On the flip side, it’s not as if Alphabet wouldn’t face a few headaches if it were to bring Twitter into the fold. Why Alphabet Inc Wouldn’t Want Twitter For starters, while “a few tweaks here and there” might turn Twitter into something better than what it is right now, to fully unlock the potential of the microblogging platform would require a deeper integration into the Google framework. That could be tricky for logistical as well as perception reasons. Internet users are a fickle bunch. Some changes they like, but most changes aren’t easily digested. Although Twitter only has a small crowd of a little more than 300 million regular users, they’re a very loyal crowd … to the platform as it stands right now. Even the mere perception of change could send them packing. Problem is, to get the most out of Twitter, someone would have to make at least a couple of key structural changes to the interface.

There is debate on when is Google's birthday Sep 27, 2016, 11:45 am EST  |  By William White, InvestorPlace Writer     “When is Google’s birthday?” is a popular question about the Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG,GOOGL) search engine today, Sept. 27, 2016. It doesn’t really come as a surprise that people are wondering “When is Google’s birthday?” today. The search engine is celebrating its 18th birthday with a Google Doodle today. If users click on this Google Doodle, the search engine will look for the answer to that question. It comes up with Sept. 27. While Sept. 27 has been used many times in the past to celebrate Google’s birthday, that hasn’t always been the case. There are only Google Doodles for its 4th, 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th, 13th, 14th, 16th, 17th, and of course, its 18th birthday. This leaves a few years where the tech company celebrated the birthday event on different days. Adding further to the confusion over when is Google’s birthday is the tech company’s own official history of its creation. The company’s timeline claims that Larry Page and Sergey Brin registered Google.com as a domain on Sept. 15, 1997. However, it wasn’t until Sept. 4 of the following year that the two filed for incorporation to make it a private company. Knowing that Google’s origins are closer to Sept. 15 or Sept. 4 doesn’t really matter in the larger scheme of things. The company will likely continue to celebrate its birthday on Sept. 27. Still, being able to provide a more detailed answer to the question “When is Google’s birthday?” might be one of those fun facts that can be brought up around friends or family. GOOG and GOOGL shares were up 1% as of Tuesday morning.

The new products include YouTube Go, the Google Assistant in Hindi inside messaging app Allo, faster browsing for Google Play on 2G connections, Google Station Wi-Fi platform and data-saving features in Google Chrome for mobile. Inaugurating the big party as part of the birthday celebration, Google South East Asia and India Vice-President Rajan Anandan said Google’s effort  is to give all Indians access to Internet. “Through initiatives in India since December 2015, including the success of Wi-Fi offering in partnership with RailTel and efforts to overcome the gender divide by training women across rural India, Google has been driving the use of Internet,” he said. Google Vice President (Next Billion Users) Caesar Sengupta said three new Internet users are getting added every second in India, which present a huge opportunity. “Google is focussing on three key areas — access, products and platforms — to provide a better and more inclusive online experience for users in India,” he said. “We have been thinking about how to build products and services for this wave of new users — products that work for any level of connectivity, in local Indian languages, and across the devices that are most frequently used in India,” he added. Following its partnership with RailTel and Indian Railways to provide Wi-Fi at railway stations, Google has now launched a platform called Google Station. The new platform will work with partners like system integrators (SIs) and venue owners to roll out Wi-Fi hotspots, Sengupta said. Its new messaging app ‘Allo’ will introduce support in Hindi for its Google Assistant later this year. Google also announced a group of tailored features for Chrome, like automatic optimising of pages when 2G-like networks are detected. Googles new app YouTube Go is aimed at being data efficient and promoting offline usage.   The app will also allow for videos to be saved and viewed without buffering on slow connections.

At the second "Google for India" event in New Delhi which coincided with the search giant's 18th birthday, the company announced that "Google Station" will connect public places like malls, railway stations, bus stops and hangouts like cafes and universities. Its artificial intelligence-powered Google Assistant will be available in Hindi by the end of the year via newly-launched mobile messaging app Allo, the company announced as its launched a slew of products in three categories -- Access, Platform and Products -- covering services like Google Play, Chrome, YouTube Go and Google Duo. "Every second, three Indians come online and we have to ensure that the experience is wonderful and relevant for them. But the next billion is very different from the first billion and by building products for these users we are preparing for how the world will use tech in the coming years," Caesar Sengupta, Vice-President, Next Billion Users at Google, told reporters here. With an aim to encourage women to get online, the company launched "Internet Saathi" programme in 2015 and a 10-times growth in local language queries has been registered since then. Under the Google-Tata Trust initiative, 25,000 villages now have internet saathis and one million women across 10 states have been trained so far. Talking about Google's collaboration with Indian Railways and RailTel to bring high-speed Internet at railway stations, Sengupta said Wi-Fi is now available at 52 stations with Mumbai CST the latest addition. "Nearly 3.5 million users are now using Railways Wi-Fi and 15,000 users are now coming online every day," he noted. Sengupta also announced a new Google Play store which can now load on slower 2G connections, have options to schedule and preload downloads and install apps only over Wi-Fi. According to John Giannardrea, Senior Vice President (Search), the company has been making progress in localising Google Search with the introduction of machine learning. "Google is now capable of translating 100 languages and 12 of these are from India," he added. Amit Fulay, Product Lead for communication apps Google Duo and Google Allo, said India and the US have most number of Duo users and Allo has seen a tremendous response in India. Google Allo is a new smart messaging app that helps users make plans, find information as well as express with ease, all within the chat and it works on all type of connections. Packed with innovative features including smart reply, options for sharing photos, emojis and stickers specially designed for India, Google Allo makes it easier for users to respond quickly and keep the conversation moving, even when one is on the go. Announcing new features in Chrome, Rahul Roy Chowdhury, VP (Chrome), said that new product now saves data, has offline capabilities and has more accurate content discovery. Chrome can now work on 2G data connection and can save loads of data. People have saved over 337 TB of data, including 138 TB of video data that is equivalent to Rs 7 crore savings each week, Roy-Chowdhury informed. "Chrome data saver can save up to 67 per cent of data while watching videos. The optimised pages have a similar look to the heavy pages and they can now load five times faster than before saving up to 90 per cent of the data," Roy-Chowdhury added. Johanna Wright, Vice President (Product Management) at YouTube, announced YouTube Go which has an easy user interface, works on low connectivity, cuts cost in data usage and offers personalised suggestions to the users. With a tagline of "Mazze Udao, Data Nahi", YouTube Go now allows a user to preview and choose the size of the video. Users can now save, watch and share videos even when the connection is poor. Based on browsing history, patterns and languages, the new app will also serve 10 new videos every week. --IANS sku/na/bg Advertisement << Previous Article   «Back Ad Ad Most Read Demonetisation: Get Rs 2,000 cash at petrol pumps from Nov 18 Decoding the big ATM problem: India just doesn't have enough engineers for the job Modus Operandi: How black money hoarders are trying to escape I-T lens More trouble ahead as Tata Trusts get I-T summons for tax avoidance TomTom launches fitness tracker and watch range in India More From Current Affairs Project 15A to end with commissioning of INS Chennai on Monday Modi's currency ban finds support in Australia Why good cholesterol may fail to protect against heart disease Expand manufacturing, services to boost job creation: Sitharaman Rupee weakens to new nine-month low [ more ] Top Stories Mitali Saran: The audacity of scope Bharat Forge acquires US-based Walker Forge Tennessee for $14 mn Home Ministry issues notification on banning Zakir Naik's NGO: Key takeaways SC rejects Centre's stand on reconsideration of judicial recommendations T N Ninan: Our post-truths [ more ] Markets Diamond exporters eye 8-10% rise in exports in coming quarter Nifty nears 6-month low, Sensex ends 77 points lower Vakrangee, Oil India, Engineers India, Infibeam Incorporation hit 52-week high Sugar shares in focus; Upper Ganges, Oudh Sugar up 20% UP hikes sugarcane price by Rs 25/quintal for 2016-17 crushing season [ more ] Companies GreenSignal Bio Pharma IPO runs into rough weather, no response from QIBs Mopeds gain speed, overtake scooters in growth Youngsters should pursue more research in maths: Narayana Murthy Bharat Forge acquires US-based Walker Forge Tennessee for $14 mn Pellet maker KIOCL to acquire 51% stake in Odisha PSU Idcol [ more ] Opinion Why Gruh Finance isn't a top pick among analysts anymore?

Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump reacts after speaking at a rally Tuesday, Sept. 27, 2016, in Melbourne, Fla. (AP Photo/John Locher) The Clintons say Israel has lost a leader "who championed its security, prosperity and limitless possibilities from its birth to his last day on earth." The Clintons are calling Peres "a genius with a big heart who used his gifts to imagine a future of reconciliation, not conflict." ___ 10 p.m. Hillary Clinton is picking up another Republican endorsement, this time from former Virginia Senator John Warner. Warner is set to appear Wednesday morning with Democratic vice presidential nominee — and current Virginia senator — Tim Kaine in Arlington. Warner served five terms in the Senate and has strong national security credentials. He is a former Navy secretary and Senate Armed Service Committee chairman. Warner's endorsement strengthens Clinton's argument that she is better prepared to handle national security and foreign policy than rival Donald Trump. Warner and Clinton served together briefly in the Senate. He retired in 2009. Clinton's campaign says this is Warner's first time endorsing a Democratic presidential nominee. She says she's honored Warner would trust her "with the weighty responsibility of being Commander in Chief." ___ 9 p.m. Donald Trump's campaign and the Republican Party have raised around $18 million following his first presidential debate with rival Hillary Clinton. Trump told a packed crowd at an airplane hangar in Melbourne, Florida, that the total marks his biggest one-day haul of the campaign. Trump says: "They raised almost $18 million today. Can you believe it? And that was largely because of last night." Trump has been aggressively raising money ahead of the election's final end-of-quarter fundraising deadline at the end of September. The sum includes money raised through online donations as well as higher-dollar donations from a "National Call Day." Trump's campaign is planning a major investment in advertising from now through Election Day that will require a serious infusion of cash. ___ 7:46 p.m. The self-proclaimed master of massive rally crowds is suggesting that even he was a little intimidated by the audience of millions watching the debate Monday against Hillary Clinton. Trump told supporters in an airplane hangar in Melbourne, Florida, Tuesday that he knew he "was going into a situation where you were going to have one of the largest audiences in the history of television." He says he "took a deep breath" and "pretended I was talking to my family. It's very interesting. You just block it out." The showdown was the most-watched presidential debate ever, with 84 million viewers. The Nielsen company said the viewership toppled a record that had stood for 36 years. More than 80 million people watched the only debate in 1980 between incumbent Democrat Jimmy Carter and Republican challenger Ronald Reagan. ___ 7:33 p.m. Donald Trump says he was holding back during his debate against Hillary Clinton because he didn't want to embarrass her. The Republican presidential nominee addressed Monday night's debate at length for the first time publicly during a Tuesday evening rally in Melbourne, Fla. He was on his heels for much of the night, but proclaimed victory on Tuesday as he faced rowdy supporters in an airport hangar. Trump said that Clinton was "stuck in the past" during the debate. He said she defended "the horrible status quo" for the 90 minute debate-stage clash. He added, "I was also holding back — I didn't want to do anything to embarrass her." He previously said he held back to avoid embarrassing the Clintons' daughter, Chelsea, who also was in the debate audience. Trump's team said he was planning to bring up Bill Clinton's infidelities during the debate, but changed his mind. ___ 6:25 p.m. The Georgia state director for the Donald J. Trump campaign has resigned after his criminal past was revealed. WSB-TV reports that Bibb County sheriff's deputies arrested Brandon Phillips in 2008 on battery and felony criminal damage. Phillips pleaded guilty to criminal trespassing charges after admitting he destroyed one person's laptop and slashed another person's tires. A senior communications adviser for the Republican presidential nominee said in a statement, "Today we accepted the resignation of the Trump-Pence campaign's Georgia state director Brandon Phillips. Billy Kirkland, our Georgia senior adviser, will continue to lead the campaign's operations in Georgia." Phillips was hired on Nov. 2, 2015. ___ 6:07 p.m. Pennsylvania voter Patricia Bennett says she heard unmistakable sexism in Donald Trump's challenge of Hillary Clinton's stamina during the candidates' first debate. Bennett was one of two dozen female voters from battleground states who spoke with The Associated Press the day after Monday's first presidential debate. Nearly all had concerns with Trump's critical comments about women, as well as his aggressive approach to Clinton in the debate. The concerns were shared by some women who plan to vote for Trump in November, though his supporters were more forgiving in their assessment. Clinton has held a lead with women voters throughout her general election contest with Trump. But she needs to widen that margin as much as possible to offset her weakness with men. ___ 3:57 p.m. Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump will share a stage next month — but will trade jokes, not attack lines. The Archdiocese of New York announced Tuesday that both candidates will both appear at the Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation dinner on October 20. The white-tie event, which raises money for charity, is annually at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York and every four years draws the major parties' presidential nominees. Traditionally, the candidates sit on either side of Cardinal Timothy Dolan and take turns delivering humorous speeches. Four years ago, President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney traded good-natured barbs and self-deprecating jokes. The dinner will be held just two days after the third and final presidential debate. __ 3:29 p.m. One of Donald Trump's chief Republican detractors says the GOP presidential candidate performed poorly in Monday's debate and all but admitted it. Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake says, "When you blame the mic, that's as close as you get to conceding that you had a bad night." Trump said his microphone went on and off during his encounter with Hillary Clinton and was set at a low volume. He said he wondered if the moderators did that purposely, though he offered no evidence. Flake says, "Trump was Trump. Light on substance, heavy on theatrics." Flake has refused to endorse Trump. The two have criticized each other for months. The senator says Trump missed opportunities to criticize Clinton's record. He says Trump went down "rabbit holes" by talking about "beauty contestants." ___ 3:05 p.m. Donald Trump says he will participate in the next two presidential debates. The Republican presidential contender was asked by reporters about his intentions during a Tuesday afternoon appearance in Miami. He said "sure" when asked by reporters whether he would participate in the subsequent debates. Also on hand was Trump adviser Rudy Giuliani, the former New York City mayor. Giuliani suggested the night before that he would not attend the upcoming debates if he were Trump. Many Republicans believe Democrat Hillary Clinton bested Trump in their first face-off. Trump earlier criticized the debate moderator and complained he had been given a faulty microphone. ___ 2:35 p.m. President Barack Obama is contrasting the two main presidential candidates in the aftermath of their first debate. Obama is calling Hillary Clinton well-respected around the world, serious and someone with a vision of how to put people back to work. Obama admits he's biased about his former secretary of state. He says Republican Donald Trump "doesn't have the preparation, the temperament, or the core values of inclusion" that would take America forward. Obama's comments came in a radio interview with Ryan Seacrest. It was intended to encourage people to register to vote. Obama said this year's election is especially important because there are such big differences between the candidates. ___ 2:15 p.m. Donald Trump is describing Monday night's debate as "an interesting evening." The Republican presidential nominee briefly addressed his first faceoff with Democrat Hillary Clinton during a Tuesday afternoon appearance near Miami's Little Havana neighborhood. The audience was largely Cuban-American. Trump said more than 80 million people watched the debate. He said he tried not to think about the large television audience. He said, "I think we did very well." He suggested he was the winner in virtually all post-debate polls. That's despite many Republican leaders and voter surveys suggesting that Clinton came out on top. Trump called it, "a very big moment, a very important moment." ___ 2:10 p.m. Hillary Clinton is winning applause from supporters in North Carolina for her performance in Monday night's debate. They greeted the Democratic presidential candidate with cheers on Tuesday after Clinton asked if they saw her first face-off with Republican rival Donald Trump. Clinton says she was happy to have the opportunity to lay out her vision for the United States. She says she has an "old-fashioned idea that if I'm asking for your vote, to actually tell you what I want to do." Clinton also urged supporters to register to vote. She predicted record turnout in November. ___ 1:55 p.m. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi is mocking Donald Trump as "Mr. Last Night" and suggests he might not show up for the next debate after an uneven performance on Monday. The California Democrat also told reporters that she feels sorry for Trump and "maybe he'll get the sympathy vote." And she brought up his hairstyle, suggesting no female candidate could get away with hair like "whatever his name is, Trump." Pelosi later claimed to have trouble remembering his name. Pelosi heaped praise on Hillary Clinton's performance. Of Trump, she said: "That was pathetic so I don't know that he even shows up again." ___ 1:35 p.m. Former Miss Universe Alicia Machado says her experience with Donald Trump "can open eyes" in the presidential election. Trump criticized Machado for gaining weight after she won the pageant in 1996. Hillary Clinton revived Trump's remarks in Monday night's debate, using them as an example of how the Republican treats women. Machado spoke with reporters Tuesday in a conference call arranged by the Clinton campaign. She says she was "really surprised" to hear Clinton reference her story in the debate. Machado says she wants to help Clinton in the election. She says, "I'm here for her." ___ 1:30 p.m. The White House is applauding Hillary Clinton for her debate performance, saying the candidate the president strongly supports is the candidate who performed "quite strongly." Spokesman Josh Earnest said President Barack Obama watched Monday's debate from the White House Treaty Room. He said Clinton made a powerful case for building on the economic progress the United States has made during the Obama years in digging out of the biggest downturn since the Depression. Earnest is also contrasting Republican Donald Trump's unwillingness to release his tax returns to Obama's decision to do so as a candidate and as president. Earnest said that transparency is "good for the process and good for voters as they make a really important decision about the future of the country." ___ 1:05 p.m. Republican vice presidential nominee Mike Pence is meeting with Gov. Scott Walker for debate preparation in Wisconsin. Pence spokesman Marc Lotter says the Indiana governor was to meet with Walker on Tuesday, one week before Pence squares off against Democrat Tim Kaine in their only debate. Walker is standing in for Kaine in Pence's debate preparation. They have previously held similar mock debate sessions. Pence is also attending a fundraiser in Madison. He has no official public events in Wisconsin on Tuesday. He had previously announced an evening rally in the conservative city of Waukesha, but it was canceled because Donald Trump is going to be there Wednesday night ___ 12:55 p.m. Former New Hampshire Gov. John H. Sununu is the latest Donald Trump skeptic to back the Republican presidential nominee. Sununu says Trump is the only candidate who can "bring bold change" to Washington. Sununu was White House chief of staff to President George H.W. Bush. The Trump campaign touted Sununu's endorsement Tuesday, after Sununu introduced vice presidential nominee Mike Pence at a rally Monday in the state. But Democrats are pointing out that Sununu hasn't always been a fan of Trump. He once told a Bloomberg reporter that Republicans' chance of winning back the governorship would be hurt by Trump. Sununu's son, Chris Sununu, is the Republican nominee for governor. ___ 12:25 p.m. Vice President Joe Biden is questioning Donald Trump's "moral center" as a result of the Republican presidential candidate's comments about America's housing collapse. Biden told a Hillary Clinton rally at Drexel University in Philadelphia on Tuesday that Trump had bragged at Monday's presidential debate about profiting from the failed housing market. The vice president said Trump "is a guy who said it was good business for him to see the housing market fail." Biden added, "What in the hell is he talking about?" At the debate, Clinton said Trump had rooted for the housing collapse in 2006 because he saw it as a way to go in and make money. Trump responded, "That's called business, by the way." Biden said Trump "brags about gaming the system and bankruptcy." ___ 12:15 p.m. FBI Director James Comey says his agency granted immunity to Hillary Clinton's former chief of staff because agents wanted to inspect her laptop as part of a now-closed FBI investigation into Clinton's use of a private email server. Comey told a Senate committee on Tuesday that an immunity deal for Cheryl Mills was limited to information contained on her laptop. He added that the FBI's collective judgment was that "we need to get to that laptop." Comey told Sen. Ben Sasse, a Republican from Nebraska, that Mills was acting as a member of Clinton's legal team in the case. He said the FBI decided it would take too long to try to force Mills to turn over the laptop without an immunity deal. The FBI investigated Clinton's use of a private mail server for official communications while secretary of state, but no charges were filed. ___ 11:30 a.m. House Speaker Paul Ryan is praising Donald Trump's debate performance, saying he showed he can "go toe-to-toe with Hillary Clinton." Ryan said Trump "gave a unique Donald Trump response to the status quo... I think he passed a number of thresholds." The Wisconsin Republican refused to comment on Trump's attacks Tuesday morning on a Miss Universe contestant over her weight gain. He said he hadn't seen Trump's remarks. Despite Ryan's positive spin, some other House Republicans voiced some disappointment over Trump's performance. Some said there were missed opportunities to attack Clinton over her family foundation and other issues that didn't come up in the debate. Congressman Bill Flores of Texas says Trump "wasn't quite as consistent as I would've liked him to have been." ___ 11:25 a.m. A senior House Democrat says Donald Trump "came unhinged" during Monday's debate and demonstrated that he is not qualified to be president. Rep. Xavier Becerra of California, the chairman of the Democratic Caucus, told reporters Tuesday that Trump showed disrespect to Clinton and American voters by constantly "badgering and interrupting" the Democratic presidential nominee. Becerra said: "Donald Trump essentially showed who he is." He said: "He gave us a sense of his character and his temperament." Becerra says Trump "came unhinged" at several points, though the congressman didn't cite specific examples. He said "that's the last thing you want for a president who will have his or her finger over the nuclear button." ___ 11:20 p.m. Hillary Clinton says she's feeling good after Monday night's debate and is looking forward to the next two match-ups with Donald Trump. The Democratic presidential candidate said the debate showed "clear differences" between the candidates' temperaments and qualifications for the presidency. Clinton spoke to reporters Tuesday on her campaign plane. She's holding a rally and a fundraiser in Raleigh, North Carolina, later in the day. She said her Republican rival cast the country in "dire and dark terms" and "That's not who America is." She couldn't resist a final dig on Trump as she returned to her seat at the front of the cabin. Trump had complained that he was given a "terrible" microphone during the debate. Clinton said: "Anybody who complains about the microphone is not having a good night." ____ 10:15 a.m Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine says the presidential debate showed Hillary Clinton has Donald Trump beat when it comes to stamina. Trump doubled down at the end of Monday's debate on his frequent criticism that Clinton lacks the "stamina" to be commander in chief. She shot back by ticking off the busy schedule she kept as secretary of state. Kaine said Clinton looked like she could have debated for 11 more hours. But he said Trump looked "rattled" and like a boxer leaning on the ropes waiting for a knockout. Kaine delivered his remarks Tuesday morning at an organizing event in Orlando, Florida. ___ 9:35 a.m. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg is reacting to Donald Trump's call for the alliance to do more to fight terrorism. He says it has long made fighting terrorism a top priority. Stoltenberg told reporters in Slovakia Tuesday that "NATO has been focused on the fight against terrorism for many, many years and it's not a result of the U.S. election campaign." He recalled that NATO activated its collective defense clause known as Article 5 for the first and only time to come to the aid of the United States after the 9/11 attacks. He said: "Thousands of soldiers from European allies and Canada have been in Afghanistan as a direct result of the attacks on the United States." NATO took command of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan in 2003 ___ 9:05 a.m. Hillary Clinton apparently has the Google edge after the presidential debate. Google Trends says more people looked up Clinton's name than Republican Donald Trump's in all 50 states following Monday's debate. Google says Trump searches led in the majority of states before the debate. The search giant says users looked up information on both candidates' stances on immigration, abortion and guns most often while the debate was happening. Many used Google to do their own fact-checking on the candidates' claims. Google says the top fact check question for Trump revolved around his stance on the Iraq war. For Clinton, users wanted to follow up on her statement that stop-and-frisk police tactics had been ruled unconstitutional. ___ 8:30 a.m. Donald Trump says he didn't have the sniffles during the debate. The Republican presidential nominee sounded like he was sniffling — and loudly — through much of the presidential debate Monday, eliciting comments and jokes on social media. The hashtag #sniffle became popular on Twitter. But asked about that in a phone interview Tuesday morning on "Fox & Friends," Trump denied there was any sniffling. He said the microphone was very bad, "but maybe it was good enough to hear breathing. But there was no sniffles." He said he doesn't have a cold or allergies. ___ 8:10 a.m. The two vice presidential candidates unsurprisingly saw their running mates as debate winners. Democrat Tim Kaine says Donald Trump "looked like he was running out of gas" and Republican Mike Pence accused Hillary Clinton of launching "an avalanche of insults" at Trump. They appeared on morning news shows Tuesday after the first debate between Trump and Clinton. On NBC's "Today" show, Kaine, said he thought Trump offered few specifics on policies, adding, "I don't think he was prepared." Pence countered that Trump was "focused on the issues that the American people care about." Pence also said he thought Trump came off as an agent for change while Clinton epitomized the Washington "status quo." Kaine and Pence will appear together in a debate Oct. 4 at Longwood University in Farmville, Virginia. ___ 7:50 a.m. Donald Trump is issuing his report card for Hillary Clinton for her debate performance: C-plus. Trump also says moderator Lester Holt of NBC News earns a C or a C-plus. He says Holt asked him unfair questions. But Trump isn't giving himself a letter grade for his performance. He told Fox and Friends on Tuesday that he's merely that he's confident he did much better than Clinton in Monday night's debate. ___ 7:40 a.m. Donald Trump is floating the theory that debate moderators gave him a bad microphone on purpose. Trump says his mic at Monday's debate was "terrible." He's blaming it for what some listeners thought were sniffles by Trump during the debate. Trump said Tuesday on "Fox and Friends" that it was going on and off and that his volume was lower than Hillary Clinton's microphone. Trump tells Fox News he wonders "whether that wasn't set up that way on purpose." He says "I don't want to believe in conspiracy theories, but it was much lower than hers." Trump campaign manager Kellyann Conway told CNN that she heard from audience members that his mic sounded off. She said that from where she sat backstage, the mic sounded fine. ___ 7:20 a.m. Donald Trump says it was a "real problem" when the 1996 Miss Universe gained significant weight after winning the pageant that he formerly owned. Trump is responding to Hillary Clinton's reference in the first debate to Alicia Machado's claim that Trump called her "Miss Piggy" when she gained weight. In the debate, Trump repeatedly challenged Clinton over where she had heard that. But Trump told "Fox and Friends" on Tuesday that Machado was "the worst we ever had," referring to past winners of the pageant. Trump says, "She gained a massive amount of weight. It was a real problem. We had a real problem." ____ 3:45 a.m. Donald Trump aggressively tried to pin the nation's economic and national security problems on Hillary Clinton in the first presidential debate, belittling the former senator and secretary of state as a "typical politician" incapable of delivering the change many Americans crave. But Trump found himself on the defensive for much of the 90-minute showdown Monday night. Clinton was thoroughly prepared, not only with detailed answers about her own policy proposals, but also sharp criticism of Trump's business record, his past statements about women, and his false assertions that President Barack Obama may not have been born in the United States. The Democrat also blasted Trump for his refusal to release his tax returns, breaking with decades of presidential campaign tradition.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search Udacity creates a nanodegree course to push VR forward JC Torres - Sep 27, 2016 0 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit As wildly popular as virtual reality might have become, and as now widespread it may have been, thanks to the likes of Google Cardboard, the content available for the technology has barely scratched the surface. That’s mostly because the knowledge on how to create such virtual experience still rests in the hands of a few. Seeking to liberate that knowledge, Udacity has crafted a program that partners with the who’s who in the VR industry to train minds, and hands, in becoming a VR Developer. While there are tons of online tutorials, classes, and even courses, available today, Udacity has set itself apart with its “Nanodegree” programs, basically more formalized, and paid, online courses that offer not just higher quality content but also exposure to industry companies and figures. Udacity has already partnered with Google previously for its Android nanodegree, and now it is doing so again, among other companies, for virtual reality. This time, Udacity has cast the net wide to include Google VR, HTC Vive, and Upload, some of the biggest names in the VR market. Though with different products, all aim for the same thing: virtual reality world domination. Udacity’s VR Developer Nanodegree gets the ball rolling by introducing students to the core concepts of VR, the tools needed to create games and content, as well as the finer details needed to prevent people from getting sick from playing your game. The course tries to hit multiple platforms, thanks to having Unity as the foundation of the VR environment, but Google VR is the primary focus of the nanodegree. That said, the course also has an optional “High Immersion VR” track that covers setups like the HTC Vive and the Oculus Rift. The Udacity VR Developer Nanodegree is, unsurprisingly, not free and comes with a $199 monthly tuition. However, 50% of that is refunded when the student graduates from the course. In addition to the learning materials, that fee covers unique features like one-on-one mentorship and face-to-face learning, no to mention the networking with industry partners that could set you on the right track towards a profitable career in VR.

Cross-device remarketing for Google Display Network and DoubleClick Bid Manager can help you target the same ads to the same users as they move between their devices. In addition, ads will also be remarketed toward users across websites, apps, and anywhere ads on the Google Display Network are eligible to be shown. In order not to overwhelm your audience with too much advertising, you have full control over the frequency in which people see your ads. “Let’s say you’re a retailer and want to build a customized Halloween campaign. With cross-device remarketing, you can reach your customers with an “It’s almost Halloween” ad on their phone during the morning commute. Later in the day, you can follow up with a limited time offer on decorations and recipes when they’re browsing a tablet at home.” That’s just one of the many examples of how AdWords cross-device remarketing can be used. With the holiday season just around the corner, cross-device remarketing on AdWords can help keep your business top of mind. The feature will be available over the course of the next few months. Expect more details to follow as Advertising Week continues.

Here's a look at the products the search giant is expected to introduce at the event. Expect to Hear Android Adoption Talk Apple has talked about the iPhone's success, and now it's Google's turn to tout Android smartphones. Just as it has in previous fall press events, look for Google to announce how many devices are currently running Android, whether it will do anything to address operating system fragmentation and how Android device usage compares to that of its competitors. Developers Will Get Some Love Developers always seem to get some attention at Google's press events. Regardless of what Google announces, expect the company to talk about ways for developers to make great apps for mobile, desktop and smart home products, like Google Home. Software isn't as exciting as hardware, but it's critical to making Google's products a success. Google knows that and will talk up its investment in developers at the show. There Will Be Lots of Talk About Nougat Google's new mobile hardware will almost undoubtedly run on the company's upcoming Android operating system Nougat. While Google has talked in some detail about Nougat, expect the company to go even further at its Oct. 4 event and talk about its many features. To address fragmentation concerns, Google might also announce which popular Android-based smartphones will be getting Nougat in the coming weeks—something users have been anticipating for quite some time. Will Nexus Give Way to Pixel? Several reports have surfaced in recent weeks saying Google is dropping the Nexus brand. In its place, Google will use Pixel, the same brand it has used on other devices it sells. Despite the name change, Pixel will be just like the Nexus, offering two device sizes to customers and delivering a standard by which other Android devices are judged. As of this writing, Google is believed to have plans to unveil a 5-inch device known as Pixel and a 5.5-inch option known as Pixel XL. Like their Nexus predecessors, both Pixels are being manufactured by third-party hardware makers, according to reports. Google Hasn't Turned Its Back on Tablets The tablet market might be in freefall, but Google isn't ready to give it up. In fact, several rumors and leaked photos suggest Google could launch new tablets at its press event. While Google hasn't hinted at what future tablets might offer, serial leaker Evan Blass published a purportedly leaked photo showing a 7-inch tablet built by Huawei. It's believed the device will carry the same Pixel branding. Check Out Google Home Google Home is guaranteed to make a showing at Google's next event. The device, which was unveiled at Google I/O in May, is a smart home product that's designed to compete with Amazon's Echo. Like Echo, the hardware works with voice commands and can double as a speaker. Google has yet to announce pricing and availability, but those details should emerge on Oct. 4. Look for New OnHub Wireless Router Options Google's OnHub wireless routers have quietly joined the ranks of some of the most sought-after (and high-quality) routers on the market. However, since it's been about a year since the first OnHub router launched, it would make sense for Google to unveil new options at its Oct. 4 event. The new OnHubs will likely come with better throughput and range, and perhaps even some nice designs that allow it to remain on desks and not tucked away somewhere. Third-Party Chromebooks Still Matter Google's Chromebooks are becoming increasingly popular in the education and enterprise markets. Given that, Google will more than likely announce new Chromebooks at its event. Expect the devices to come with improved processors, a lightweight design and a similarly simple software experience. All-New Chromecast Hardware Google's Chromecast hardware is still holding on in the entertainment market, and according to several reports, the company will unveil a new device known as the Chromecast Ultra. The simple (and cheap) hardware will support 4K video streaming and a wide range of services, including Google's own Play marketplace. Reports say the Chromecast Ultra will cost $69. Will Google Talk About Andromeda? This one might be a longshot, but there have been several rumors over the last few months that Google is looking at ways to combine its Android and Chrome OS operating systems into one code-named Andromeda. It's unknown when (or if) the operating system will launch, but it's expected to be a hybrid of Android and Chrome OS and work across smartphones, tablets and computers, similar to the way Windows 10 can work across platforms.

While Google hasn't said much about its plans, a steady stream of rumors is circulating suggesting it could be a big day of product introductions for the search giant. Google is expected to drop its long-standing Nexus mobile device branding in favor of the Pixel and introduce new smartphone models under that banner, according to the reports. The company will also likely share more details on Google Home, which is an alternative to Amazon's Echo smart speaker. In addition, look for Google to provide more details about Android Nougat and announce at least one new OnHub wireless router. There's even talk of Google combining its two operating systems—Android and Chrome OS—into a hybrid code-named Andromeda. Of course, Google won't confirm exactly what it will talk about, but this slide show covers all the rumors surrounding its Oct. 4 event and explains why it could be a banner year for Google product introductions.           Don Reisinger is a freelance technology columnist.

By Bryan Adams Bryan Adams is the author of Inbound Marketing book, ‘Getting Goosebumps’, as well as the CEO & founder of the award winning digital marketing agency Ph.Creative. @Bryan_phc Founder and CEO, Ph.Creative@Bryan_phc WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement The field of digital talent attraction is evolving quickly, but many believe recruitment overall lags behind other more sophisticated digital industries. As CEO of a mature digital marketing agency, which specializes in recruitment across a vast array of sectors, I'm inclined to vehemently agree. Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is hailed as the tour de force of many digital businesses. While it is frequently bandied about the recruitment industry, it remains elementary by comparison. Many companies recognize its value in making direct hires but do not have the expertise to take full of advantage of it. In 2017, however, I predict this is going to change. As digital recruitment marketing continues to advance, here are six reasons SEO will soar to the top of the agenda for many in-house recruitment teams: 1. Significantly reduced cost per hire What's the biggest job board in the world? Google, right? Businesses that succeed in ranking high on Google above competitors, job sites and recruitment agencies will attract a much greater volume of applications directly to their website. Consistently receiving these direct applications will translate into continually reduced cost per hire. SEO will help businesses own broad terms, such as "banking jobs London", as well as specific terminology, while ranking regularly and reaping the monetary rewards. Using just basic tools to track where your website traffic is coming from such as Google Analytics will also make it easier to measure cost per hire too. 2. Sustainable talent pooling opportunities As businesses begin to rank for hard-to-fill roles, or positions they hire for time and again, they will also start building their own sustainable talent pool. This will further decrease costs and time spent searching for suitable candidates. 3. Increased reach and impact of social media content That there has been widespread uptake of businesses using social media and branded content to attract direct applications, is nothing new. Content, for example, is a tried and tested method of engaging new candidate personas and drawing them into opportunities. However, the SEO for recruitment value is often either overlooked or simply not carried out well enough to maximize its full potential. Businesses need to optimize these assets so that they rank highly, are easily discoverable, and will continue to add value for many months--and even years--to come. This process will also assist in attracting external links straight to a business's own careers section, boosting the effectiveness of its overall strategy. 4. Greater control over candidate experience The more in control businesses are of what their potential candidates see at every step of the candidate experience, the more they can design the experience to be positive, on-brand and purposeful. World-class candidate experience starts the moment a potential candidate is introduced to the employer brand; if it's via a job board or third party, it can be less than impressive. 5. Not knowing the basics is a big risk Even if SEO is not part of the wider talent attraction strategy, not having a handle on the basic SEO components can harm the performance of a business' career website. Take duplicate content, for instance. If other, more authoritative competitors or job boards are using the same content (like job descriptions), search engines might issue harsh penalties and even deny ranking future job vacancies. 6. Opened doors to SEO opportunities A growing volume of search engine traffic comes from people using mobile devices. Recruitment businesses that ignore SEO are therefore risking losing out on exposure to new candidates - and exciting new formats that engages them. The recent introduction of Google AMP, for example, means simplified content that is specifically submitted in Google's new 'AMP' format will stand a much higher chance of ranking above traditionally coded web pages. Competitive search phrases that for many businesses seem like a pipe dream could therefore become much more achievable. Of course, sometimes these marginal gains don't last long before competitors catch up, however the short-term benefits could make a real difference to recruitment challenges and goals across the year. So you see, there are more reasons to seek advice with your SEO than not. In fact, to ignore it means risking being left behind. With subtle expert changes and the addition of regular SEO resource, even in small quantities, hiring challenges could be dramatically decreased. It would bring the entire industry in-line with the rest of its digital cohort. My advice is to undertake an SEO audit of your careers website to see how you rank amongst your competition. Start to give serious consideration to factoring SEO into your plans for 2017 or risk losing valuable ground within search engines.

Resend activation e-mail Gear & Gadgets / Product News & Reviews Google’s latest IM client, Allo, isn’t ready for prime time Hands-on: As a smartphone-only service, Allo isn't ready for the modern world. by Ron Amadeo - Sep 27, 2016 4:35 pm UTC Login to bookmark 128 Google's newest attempt at creating a decent instant messaging platform, Google Allo, is finally available. Google announced the new IM service at Google I/O 2016, and a whopping four months later, we finally get to try it out. We're still not quite sure what the future of Allo holds. Will it eventually become Android's default instant messaging platform? Will we get a Chrome and Chrome OS client? After a lackluster effort with Google Hangouts (which Google says will stick around), how much does Google really care about this new platform? For now all we can do is talk about the present, and right now Google has given us an instant messaging client that doesn't seem like it was built for the modern age. Setup—Google? What’s Google? Enlarge / Setup relies on your cellular carrier's phone number. None of your Google information is pulled over. Setup is very odd in that Allo doesn't use your Google account. Sign-up and identification are done entirely through your cell carrier's phone number, just like Whatsapp and Wechat. After typing in your random string of 10 digits and getting a verification text, Allo pretends you are a complete stranger and asks for your name and profile picture. Google asking for my name is definitely off-putting, especially when—thanks to my prodigious usage of Google services—the company probably knows damn near everything about me. Allo acts more like a third-party service and pretends the Google connection doesn't exist. There is no option to sign up with an e-mail address or your existing Google account. For a profile picture, Allo demands you snap a selfie right at that moment, and while you can feed it a stored picture, there's no option to pull a profile picture from Twitter, Google, Facebook, or from the "Me" profile picture that exists in your phone contact list. I had to leave the app, go to Twitter, download my profile picture, and then go back to Allo. For a company that pushes the "Sign up with Google" button on third-party software, this makes very little sense. The carrier centricity continues through the contact interface—you can't talk to someone on Allo unless you know their phone number. Allo doesn't have its own list of friends or contacts—it just runs off of the phone's internal contact list. The basics "Whispershout"—Just hold down on the "send" button and slide up or down to adjust the text size. "Whispershout"—Just hold down on the "send" button and slide up or down to adjust the text size. Left: Send pictures, stickers, or location from the "plus" menu. Right: Hold down the microphone to record a voice message. Incognito mode has encrypted chat and allows you to set an expiration date. Smart Reply, offering "nice" in response to a picture and a few options in a heads-up notification. Once you do get the app set up, you'll find a pretty basic IM app with a contact list and conversation pages containing read and delivery receipts. Besides text, you can send pictures, stickers, your location, or a voice recording. From the contact list you can start an "Incognito" chat, which allows you to set a self-destruct time for a chat session. Google promises that your chat history won't be saved in incognito mode and that the chat is end-to-end encrypted. As far as unique features, there's "Whispershout"—a feature that lets you adjust the size of the text you send by holding down on the send button and sliding your finger up or down for larger or smaller text. It's a fun, easy-to-understand feature that I could see copied by other IM apps, but it's not a compelling reason to switch. Another unique feature is the "Smart Reply" functionality Google brought over from Google Inbox. Smart Reply has Google's cloud computers scan your message and generate a short reply. Usually this is something short like "nice" or "OK," but it's more useful than you might think. The feature is great at generating responses to "yes" or "no" questions, and Google even tries to make the responses match your usual writing style. Device and service compatibility—not cut out for 2016 Allo only supports one device. Allo only supports one device. Allo on the Pixel C. It's not compatible. Sideload Allo on the Pixel C and you get this. You can install it on an iPad, but there's no iPad layout. It will always be at this resolution, but you can enable pixel doubling and have an ugly, blown-up version. Let's talk about what you'll actually be using Allo on. Allo has an Android smartphone app, an iOS app... and that's it. There's no way to access Google Allo on the Web or from a desktop. For Google—a Web company—this is ridiculous. The Android and iOS apps are for phones only. For Android, the Play Store flags all tablets as "Not compatible." You can ignore the Play Store warning and sideload Allo on a tablet, but then—like a surprisingly high number of Android apps—it doesn't support landscape mode. That makes it unusable on Google's flagship tablet, the Pixel C. On an iPad, you can install Allo, but since there is no iPad layout, you get the old school "2X" and "1X" zoom controls. These controls give you the option of a tiny iPhone screenshot in the middle of the screen or grainy, blown-up pixel doubling. Not working on tablets is a minor problem when you realize that Allo does not support multiple devices. Let me say that again: Allo works and receives messages on a single device at a time. If you register your phone number with a second device, Allo turns off on the first device, and you'll get a notification saying that this device won't receive Allo messages anymore. According to a GlobalWebIndex study, the average Internet user owns 3.64 connected devices. Allo, which is only going to work on one of those devices, just doesn't seem built for the modern era. If you do switch devices using the same phone number, you'll find yourself setting it up like you're a totally new user. Allo doesn't remember your name or your profile picture, and all your chats will be gone. From the user's perspective, Allo doesn't seem to save anything on the Internet at all. As a Google product, you would expect Allo to work very well with Google's ecosystem, but that isn't the case, either. Allo works with Android phones but not Android tablets. It doesn't support Android Wear. It doesn't work on Android Auto. It doesn't support Android features like Direct Share or Direct Reply. There's no way to use it on Chrome or Chrome OS. It doesn't work with Google Voice. It doesn't support usage through "OK Google" voice commands. It doesn't even offer a way to jump into Duo for a video call, which was supposed to be Allo's "companion" video app. Allo and an SMS app showing the same conversation. Media doesn't make it over SMS, and the "contact" is a 5-digit short code. Allo and an SMS app showing the same conversation. Media doesn't make it over SMS, and the "contact" is a 5-digit short code. Every media message contains a link to this page, which just instructs you to install Allo to see them. The short code proxy triggers scary warnings on smartphones. Allo has SMS support, but it's not at all like what users of Hangouts, iMessage, or Facebook Messenger are used to. SMSes sent through the Allo app don't use your carrier's SMS system. They get sent first to Google, which then sends them to your contact. SMSes arriving to the other person don't appear to come from your phone number—they arrive as a five-digit short code. Everything works as expected when you send a text, but any media content—pictures, voice recordings, or stickers—don't get sent. Instead Google appends an advertisement to the end of your text message—a URL that instructs the other person to download Allo if they want to see the content. On some Android devices without Allo, Google Play Services will kick in with a popup ad for Allo when someone sends you a message. This is actually a new feature of Google Play Services called "App Preview Messaging," which opens up the SMS forwarding feature to all messaging apps. Despite some basic SMS functionality, Allo can't replace your current SMS app. It can't be registered as the default SMS client on Android, and it can't receive messages sent to your phone number.

Users will be able to download content to watch when disconnected. The app will target emerging markets and particularly concentrate on India. YouTube Go is "built from the ground up for India," according to Google. The company has spent an entire year creating the app. Today, it reaches user testing with "extensive" groups of people. It will see a full release in the future. YouTube Go has been designed to meet the special demands and challenges of providing video content to people who have limited internet access. Poor connectivity can be due to a variety of reasons. Slow connections, the high cost of cellular plans and unreliable network infrastructure are all factors in markets such as India. YouTube Go Google Considering these problems, Google came up with a solution that gives users a more robust playback experience. YouTube Go includes mechanisms that let it adapt to different connectivity situations, detecting when transfer speeds are slow and dynamically reducing quality. The app makes it clear how much data the user is consuming, preventing people from going over capped mobile contracts and incurring steep charges. YouTube Go also includes the ability to download videos to play while completely offline. This is already possible in select markets from within the standard YouTube app. The implementation in YouTube Go lifts some of the restrictions placed on the regular approach though, including countdown timers that prevent you saving a video for more than 48 hours. YouTube Go has been designed to be "offline first" and includes more versatile download options. YouTube Go Google This kind of feature could be popular with users across the world, facilitating significant mobile data use reductions by downloading video at home to watch while on the go. It will be of particular value to Indian consumers where 2G networks are still commonplace. YouTube Go marks Google's commitment to providing users around the world with access to its services. The company built the app in response to feedback from customers, many of whom enjoy using YouTube but end up waiting minutes for content to buffer each time they load a new video. "We’ve always believed that connectivity should not be a barrier to watching YouTube," said Google. "We realized that for the next generation of YouTube users to fully discover all that YouTube has to offer, we had to reimagine the YouTube mobile app from the ground up," the company added. Updated Data Saving mode in Chrome Mobile Google Alongside YouTube Go, Google today announced an expanded Data Saver mode in the Chrome mobile app. Data Saver currently saves 138TB of data a week in India, the equivalent of 14 years of HD video. It is now able to compress videos as well as webpages, saving up to 67 percent of a user's data. Additionally, Chrome has been expanded with a built-in Download mode that enables webpages to be cached in their entirety for offline reading. It will roll out to all users in a future update. YouTube Go will launch first in India. It will come to other regions worldwide in the future. Google hasn't yet announced any specific markets that will see the new app. You can get more information and register for the initial trial at youtubego.com/signup.

The Archdiocese of New York announced Tuesday that both candidates will both appear at the Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation dinner on October 20. The white-tie event, which raises money for charity, is annually at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York and every four years draws the major parties' presidential nominees. Traditionally, the candidates sit on either side of Cardinal Timothy Dolan and take turns delivering humorous speeches. Four years ago, President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney traded good-natured barbs and self-deprecating jokes. The dinner will be held just two days after the third and final presidential debate. __ 3:29 p.m. One of Donald Trump's chief Republican detractors says the GOP presidential candidate performed poorly in Monday's debate and all but admitted it. Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake says, "When you blame the mic, that's as close as you get to conceding that you had a bad night." Trump said his microphone went on and off during his encounter with Hillary Clinton and was set at a low volume. He said he wondered if the moderators did that purposely, though he offered no evidence. Flake says, "Trump was Trump. Light on substance, heavy on theatrics." Flake has refused to endorse Trump. The two have criticized each other for months. The senator says Trump missed opportunities to criticize Clinton's record. He says Trump went down "rabbit holes" by talking about "beauty contestants." ___ 3:05 p.m. Donald Trump says he will participate in the next two presidential debates. The Republican presidential contender was asked by reporters about his intentions during a Tuesday afternoon appearance in Miami. He said "sure" when asked by reporters whether he would participate in the subsequent debates. Also on hand was Trump adviser Rudy Giuliani, the former New York City mayor. Giuliani suggested the night before that he would not attend the upcoming debates if he were Trump. Many Republicans believe Democrat Hillary Clinton bested Trump in their first face-off. Trump earlier criticized the debate moderator and complained he had been given a faulty microphone. ___ 2:35 p.m. President Barack Obama is contrasting the two main presidential candidates in the aftermath of their first debate. Obama is calling Hillary Clinton well-respected around the world, serious and someone with a vision of how to put people back to work. Obama admits he's biased about his former secretary of state. He says Republican Donald Trump "doesn't have the preparation, the temperament, or the core values of inclusion" that would take America forward. Obama's comments came in a radio interview with Ryan Seacrest. It was intended to encourage people to register to vote. Obama said this year's election is especially important because there are such big differences between the candidates. ___ 2:15 p.m. Donald Trump is describing Monday night's debate as "an interesting evening." The Republican presidential nominee briefly addressed his first faceoff with Democrat Hillary Clinton during a Tuesday afternoon appearance near Miami's Little Havana neighborhood. The audience was largely Cuban-American. Trump said more than 80 million people watched the debate. He said he tried not to think about the large television audience. He said, "I think we did very well." He suggested he was the winner in virtually all post-debate polls. That's despite many Republican leaders and voter surveys suggesting that Clinton came out on top. Trump called it, "a very big moment, a very important moment." ___ 2:10 p.m. Hillary Clinton is winning applause from supporters in North Carolina for her performance in Monday night's debate. They greeted the Democratic presidential candidate with cheers on Tuesday after Clinton asked if they saw her first face-off with Republican rival Donald Trump. Clinton says she was happy to have the opportunity to lay out her vision for the United States. She says she has an "old-fashioned idea that if I'm asking for your vote, to actually tell you what I want to do." Clinton also urged supporters to register to vote. She predicted record turnout in November. ___ 1:55 p.m. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi is mocking Donald Trump as "Mr. Last Night" and suggests he might not show up for the next debate after an uneven performance on Monday. The California Democrat also told reporters that she feels sorry for Trump and "maybe he'll get the sympathy vote." And she brought up his hairstyle, suggesting no female candidate could get away with hair like "whatever his name is, Trump." Pelosi later claimed to have trouble remembering his name. Pelosi heaped praise on Hillary Clinton's performance. Of Trump, she said: "That was pathetic so I don't know that he even shows up again." ___ 1:35 p.m. Former Miss Universe Alicia Machado says her experience with Donald Trump "can open eyes" in the presidential election. Trump criticized Machado for gaining weight after she won the pageant in 1996. Hillary Clinton revived Trump's remarks in Monday night's debate, using them as an example of how the Republican treats women. Machado spoke with reporters Tuesday in a conference call arranged by the Clinton campaign. She says she was "really surprised" to hear Clinton reference her story in the debate. Machado says she wants to help Clinton in the election. She says, "I'm here for her." ___ 1:30 p.m. The White House is applauding Hillary Clinton for her debate performance, saying the candidate the president strongly supports is the candidate who performed "quite strongly." Spokesman Josh Earnest said President Barack Obama watched Monday's debate from the White House Treaty Room. He said Clinton made a powerful case for building on the economic progress the United States has made during the Obama years in digging out of the biggest downturn since the Depression. Earnest is also contrasting Republican Donald Trump's unwillingness to release his tax returns to Obama's decision to do so as a candidate and as president. Earnest said that transparency is "good for the process and good for voters as they make a really important decision about the future of the country." ___ 1:05 p.m. Republican vice presidential nominee Mike Pence is meeting with Gov. Scott Walker for debate preparation in Wisconsin. Pence spokesman Marc Lotter says the Indiana governor was to meet with Walker on Tuesday, one week before Pence squares off against Democrat Tim Kaine in their only debate. Walker is standing in for Kaine in Pence's debate preparation. They have previously held similar mock debate sessions. Pence is also attending a fundraiser in Madison. He has no official public events in Wisconsin on Tuesday. He had previously announced an evening rally in the conservative city of Waukesha, but it was canceled because Donald Trump is going to be there Wednesday night ___ 12:55 p.m. Former New Hampshire Gov. John H. Sununu is the latest Donald Trump skeptic to back the Republican presidential nominee. Sununu says Trump is the only candidate who can "bring bold change" to Washington. Sununu was White House chief of staff to President George H.W. Bush. The Trump campaign touted Sununu's endorsement Tuesday, after Sununu introduced vice presidential nominee Mike Pence at a rally Monday in the state. But Democrats are pointing out that Sununu hasn't always been a fan of Trump. He once told a Bloomberg reporter that Republicans' chance of winning back the governorship would be hurt by Trump. Sununu's son, Chris Sununu, is the Republican nominee for governor. ___ 12:25 p.m. Vice President Joe Biden is questioning Donald Trump's "moral center" as a result of the Republican presidential candidate's comments about America's housing collapse. Biden told a Hillary Clinton rally at Drexel University in Philadelphia on Tuesday that Trump had bragged at Monday's presidential debate about profiting from the failed housing market. The vice president said Trump "is a guy who said it was good business for him to see the housing market fail." Biden added, "What in the hell is he talking about?" At the debate, Clinton said Trump had rooted for the housing collapse in 2006 because he saw it as a way to go in and make money. Trump responded, "That's called business, by the way." Biden said Trump "brags about gaming the system and bankruptcy." ___ 12:15 p.m. FBI Director James Comey says his agency granted immunity to Hillary Clinton's former chief of staff because agents wanted to inspect her laptop as part of a now-closed FBI investigation into Clinton's use of a private email server. Comey told a Senate committee on Tuesday that an immunity deal for Cheryl Mills was limited to information contained on her laptop. He added that the FBI's collective judgment was that "we need to get to that laptop." Comey told Sen. Ben Sasse, a Republican from Nebraska, that Mills was acting as a member of Clinton's legal team in the case. He said the FBI decided it would take too long to try to force Mills to turn over the laptop without an immunity deal. The FBI investigated Clinton's use of a private mail server for official communications while secretary of state, but no charges were filed. ___ 11:30 a.m. House Speaker Paul Ryan is praising Donald Trump's debate performance, saying he showed he can "go toe-to-toe with Hillary Clinton." Ryan said Trump "gave a unique Donald Trump response to the status quo... I think he passed a number of thresholds." The Wisconsin Republican refused to comment on Trump's attacks Tuesday morning on a Miss Universe contestant over her weight gain. He said he hadn't seen Trump's remarks. Despite Ryan's positive spin, some other House Republicans voiced some disappointment over Trump's performance. Some said there were missed opportunities to attack Clinton over her family foundation and other issues that didn't come up in the debate. Congressman Bill Flores of Texas says Trump "wasn't quite as consistent as I would've liked him to have been." ___ 11:25 a.m. A senior House Democrat says Donald Trump "came unhinged" during Monday's debate and demonstrated that he is not qualified to be president. Rep. Xavier Becerra of California, the chairman of the Democratic Caucus, told reporters Tuesday that Trump showed disrespect to Clinton and American voters by constantly "badgering and interrupting" the Democratic presidential nominee. Becerra said: "Donald Trump essentially showed who he is." He said: "He gave us a sense of his character and his temperament." Becerra says Trump "came unhinged" at several points, though the congressman didn't cite specific examples. He said "that's the last thing you want for a president who will have his or her finger over the nuclear button." ___ 11:20 p.m. Hillary Clinton says she's feeling good after Monday night's debate and is looking forward to the next two match-ups with Donald Trump. The Democratic presidential candidate said the debate showed "clear differences" between the candidates' temperaments and qualifications for the presidency. Clinton spoke to reporters Tuesday on her campaign plane. She's holding a rally and a fundraiser in Raleigh, North Carolina, later in the day. She said her Republican rival cast the country in "dire and dark terms" and "That's not who America is." She couldn't resist a final dig on Trump as she returned to her seat at the front of the cabin. Trump had complained that he was given a "terrible" microphone during the debate. Clinton said: "Anybody who complains about the microphone is not having a good night." ____ 10:15 a.m Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine says the presidential debate showed Hillary Clinton has Donald Trump beat when it comes to stamina. Trump doubled down at the end of Monday's debate on his frequent criticism that Clinton lacks the "stamina" to be commander in chief. She shot back by ticking off the busy schedule she kept as secretary of state. Kaine said Clinton looked like she could have debated for 11 more hours. But he said Trump looked "rattled" and like a boxer leaning on the ropes waiting for a knockout. Kaine delivered his remarks Tuesday morning at an organizing event in Orlando, Florida. ___ 9:35 a.m. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg is reacting to Donald Trump's call for the alliance to do more to fight terrorism. He says it has long made fighting terrorism a top priority. Stoltenberg told reporters in Slovakia Tuesday that "NATO has been focused on the fight against terrorism for many, many years and it's not a result of the U.S. election campaign." He recalled that NATO activated its collective defense clause known as Article 5 for the first and only time to come to the aid of the United States after the 9/11 attacks. He said: "Thousands of soldiers from European allies and Canada have been in Afghanistan as a direct result of the attacks on the United States." NATO took command of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan in 2003 ___ 9:05 a.m. Hillary Clinton apparently has the Google edge after the presidential debate. Google Trends says more people looked up Clinton's name than Republican Donald Trump's in all 50 states following Monday's debate. Google says Trump searches led in the majority of states before the debate. The search giant says users looked up information on both candidates' stances on immigration, abortion and guns most often while the debate was happening. Many used Google to do their own fact-checking on the candidates' claims. Google says the top fact check question for Trump revolved around his stance on the Iraq war. For Clinton, users wanted to follow up on her statement that stop-and-frisk police tactics had been ruled unconstitutional. ___ 8:30 a.m. Donald Trump says he didn't have the sniffles during the debate. The Republican presidential nominee sounded like he was sniffling — and loudly — through much of the presidential debate Monday, eliciting comments and jokes on social media. The hashtag #sniffle became popular on Twitter. But asked about that in a phone interview Tuesday morning on "Fox & Friends," Trump denied there was any sniffling. He said the microphone was very bad, "but maybe it was good enough to hear breathing. But there was no sniffles." He said he doesn't have a cold or allergies. ___ 8:10 a.m. The two vice presidential candidates unsurprisingly saw their running mates as debate winners. Democrat Tim Kaine says Donald Trump "looked like he was running out of gas" and Republican Mike Pence accused Hillary Clinton of launching "an avalanche of insults" at Trump. They appeared on morning news shows Tuesday after the first debate between Trump and Clinton. On NBC's "Today" show, Kaine, said he thought Trump offered few specifics on policies, adding, "I don't think he was prepared." Pence countered that Trump was "focused on the issues that the American people care about." Pence also said he thought Trump came off as an agent for change while Clinton epitomized the Washington "status quo." Kaine and Pence will appear together in a debate Oct. 4 at Longwood University in Farmville, Virginia. ___ 7:50 a.m. Donald Trump is issuing his report card for Hillary Clinton for her debate performance: C-plus. Trump also says moderator Lester Holt of NBC News earns a C or a C-plus. He says Holt asked him unfair questions. But Trump isn't giving himself a letter grade for his performance. He told Fox and Friends on Tuesday that he's merely that he's confident he did much better than Clinton in Monday night's debate. ___ 7:40 a.m. Donald Trump is floating the theory that debate moderators gave him a bad microphone on purpose. Trump says his mic at Monday's debate was "terrible." He's blaming it for what some listeners thought were sniffles by Trump during the debate. Trump said Tuesday on "Fox and Friends" that it was going on and off and that his volume was lower than Hillary Clinton's microphone. Trump tells Fox News he wonders "whether that wasn't set up that way on purpose." He says "I don't want to believe in conspiracy theories, but it was much lower than hers." Trump campaign manager Kellyann Conway told CNN that she heard from audience members that his mic sounded off. She said that from where she sat backstage, the mic sounded fine. ___ 7:20 a.m. Donald Trump says it was a "real problem" when the 1996 Miss Universe gained significant weight after winning the pageant that he formerly owned. Trump is responding to Hillary Clinton's reference in the first debate to Alicia Machado's claim that Trump called her "Miss Piggy" when she gained weight. In the debate, Trump repeatedly challenged Clinton over where she had heard that. But Trump told "Fox and Friends" on Tuesday that Machado was "the worst we ever had," referring to past winners of the pageant. Trump says, "She gained a massive amount of weight. It was a real problem. We had a real problem." ____ 3:45 a.m. Donald Trump aggressively tried to pin the nation's economic and national security problems on Hillary Clinton in the first presidential debate, belittling the former senator and secretary of state as a "typical politician" incapable of delivering the change many Americans crave. But Trump found himself on the defensive for much of the 90-minute showdown Monday night. Clinton was thoroughly prepared, not only with detailed answers about her own policy proposals, but also sharp criticism of Trump's business record, his past statements about women, and his false assertions that President Barack Obama may not have been born in the United States. The Democrat also blasted Trump for his refusal to release his tax returns, breaking with decades of presidential campaign tradition.

Jason Cipriani/CNET The internet really, really wants you to register to vote 0 Share: Tech Culture by Alfred Ng September 27, 2016 11:47 AM PDT @alfredwkng Up Next President Obama slams fake news for eroding democracy On the top websites in the US, you'll see the same theme. Internet titans Google, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and Reddit are banding together to get out the vote this November. With tens of millions of views every day, these five sites -- along with up to 4,000 other organizations -- will be urging Americans to register to vote. The effort comes a day after Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton sparred in their first presidential debate. Google got a head start on the National Voter Registration Day internet blitz. Its Doodle on Monday showed users a simple and effective tool for getting registered. The movement started after 2008, when 6 million people couldn't vote because they were unaware of how to register, according to Matt Singer. He's the founder of National Voter Registration Day, which takes place the fourth Tuesday of September, and a proponent of a widespread web presence.

"A lot of web platforms are known for having a young audience, like Tumblr, but ... I think everyone in America uses Google." Tumblr joined the push with a link directly to a voter registration page featured on the right side of its dashboard. Silicon Alley companies like AOL, Bitly, Foursquare and Kickstarter banded together through the hashtag #TechTurnsOut, reaching out in real life to New Yorkers in a concerted effort to increase voter registration. Apps like DoorDash also joined in the effort, by delivering voter registration information straight to users' doorsteps, when it usually delivers meals. The delivery app is available in San Francisco, New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and Denver. Based in Washington, DC, Phone2Action rolled out its Civic Action Center tool, that lets users check their voter registration status, register to vote, vote early and find polling sites. Enlarge Image Facebook gets in on the voter registration action. Photo by Screenshot by Laura Martínez/CNET It's a rare occasion when a number of the country's top websites are singing in harmony. In 2012, Google, Wikipedia, Reddit and other pages "blacked out" in a protest against the Stop Online Piracy Act. Here's how the internet is banding together to help get out the vote: Google: Google's registration tool includes options for registration and deadlines on when to get that done, based on your state. This year, for the first time, the search engine giant added voter registration information in Spanish. Facebook: The social network's millions of active US users have already seen a post pinned to the top of their feeds encouraging users to register to vote. The push rolled out September 23, showing users above the age of 18 how to register, along with all their friends who have already registered. YouTube: The video giant has campaigned heavily for its users to register to vote, using the hashtag #voteIRL. It has teamed up with channels like the Young Turks and The Fung Bros to get its viewers to vote and has been pushing videos that are one minute and 34 seconds -- the average time it takes to register to vote. It also tweaked its logo to include the hashtag. Twitter: Users on Twitter will be able to join in the conversation and tell their friends and followers #iRegistered with the social network's official hashtag. The post comes with a custom emoji showing an American flag top hat with 2016 under it. Twitter is also hosting a kick-off event in Washington, DC, at 8:30 a.m. ET, with its vice president of public policy and philanthropy, Colin Crowell. #NationalVoterRegistrationDay is also trending on Twitter. Reddit: The politics subreddit of the "Front Page of the Internet" is hosting an Ask Me Anything on how to register to vote as well as issues that young people are concerned about. The subreddit is teaming up with Rock the Vote for its step-by-step guide. Snapchat: The voter registration app TurboVote is teaming up with Snapchat on Stories and Discover pages to help users get with the vote. Celebrities like Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson and Jimmy Fallon will be featured on Snapchat's stories to help users learn how to register to vote. Pandora: The internet radio site has partnered up with HeadCount, encouraging listeners to register to vote off its mobile platform with messages from artists like The National and Dispatch. The call to action points out that users can register to vote in less than a minute -- before their songs are even finished. Updated at 10:19 a.m. and 11:47 a.m. PT: Includes more details on organizations participating in National Voter Registration Day.

Google’s Anglophone West Africa spokesman, Taiwo Kola-Ogunlade, said Google Photos also offered unlimited storage for high resolution images and videos. “A wedding is that beautiful ceremony where two people are united in marriage and it is dependable on budget. “Checklist done; the wedding venue, guest list, the cake, caterer, don’t forget the “aso ebi” frenzy and so on, but still, an essential item for any wedding ceremony is the photograph. “Not capturing beautiful moments of weddings can be a disaster and so photos are essential even after the ceremony,’’ the Google spokesman said in a statement on Tuesday. He said that smartphones had made it possible for almost everyone to be a photographer and Google was making it easier with Google Photos. “Nowadays, wedding photos have moved from the usual hard copy printouts to having photo albums that are beautifully designed by contracted photographers for weddings. “Some have even gone a step further to have their photos posted online on various wedding blogs and websites, which is also a trend nowadays,’’ Kola-Ogunlade said. Kola-Ogunlade said that for weddings, one could download the Google Photos app from the iTunes Store if an iPhone user or from the Play Store if an Android user. He said that getting hold of everyone’s photo after the wedding could be tricky but listed few tips to make Google Photos the right photo app to make the process painless. These included choosing a hash tag that was simple, yet unique enough to remember, creating a shared album in Google Photos, tracking the photos and editing photos on Google Photos. The Google spokesperson added that the Google photos app could be downloaded from the app store on one’s device and viewed on the computer at https://photos.google.com. He listed other Google Photos functions as the possibility of uploading as much content as one wanted for free as well as its availability on iPhone Operating System, Android and desktop apps. “This allows one to auto-sync images and videos from your mobile devices, PC, camera or SD cards and can also upload photos through a “drag-and-drop” interface. “Google Photos will merge two or more duplicates of photos, leaving only just one photo, thereby cleaning your storage space automatically. “Smarter search is incorporated in Google Photos. You can search through your photos with a keyword much like what you do when searching for images in Google Search. “For example, searching your wedding photos with the keyword, ‘food’, will return every image of food in it. You can also search with a colour keyword like red, green or blue. “A new feature of Google Photos is that it allows you to snap few photos in succession and create an animated Graphics Interchange Format (GIF), which can be fun for your wedding photos,’’ Kola-Ogunlade added.

Portman quietly deploys web tools as Ohio Senate race rages Julie Carr Smyth, Associated Press 2:52 p.m. EDT September 27, 2016 Buy Photo Sen. Rob Portman from Terrace Park (Photo: Enquirer file/Meg Vogel)Buy Photo COLUMBUS — Much of the work of U.S. Sen. Rob Portman's re-election campaign in Ohio is happening under the fingertips of voters. Google says Portman has made some of the savviest use this election cycle of its digital resources as his campaign has begun to unravel an early lead by former Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland. Through his well-funded campaign, Portman is effectively using data mining, YouTube ads and search promotion in his race against Strickland, a Democrat, said Lee Dunn, head of the tech giant's elections-industry operation in Washington, D.C. USA TODAY Can tailored Twitter ads tip the Ohio Senate race scales? Most political campaigns use Google. In fact, Strickland's Senate campaign also has employed the company's search lifts and data mining tools and even helped test non-skippable, six-second "bumper ads" on YouTube last spring. But Dunn said the Republican's prolonged and varied use of Google's tools, while typical among corporate clients, is rare in politics. "I would say Fortune 500 companies always seem to be a little bit farther ahead than politicians, as you can imagine," she said. "Candidates are relearning these tools every four or five years, and Fortune 500 companies are learning every day how to utilize the latest available technology." Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona has also notably used Google tools for a Spanish-language campaign aimed at Hispanic voters, and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign made extensive use of Google to turn out voters and to issue blasts to his supporters' mobile devices. David Niven, an assistant professor of political science at the University of Cincinnati, said Portman has had the advantage of deep campaign reserves accumulated as Republicans' seek to hold onto what was viewed initially as one of the country's most vulnerable Senate seats. "He jumped on digital even six years ago, because he knew he would have the resources for a full-throated campaign, and it's increasingly hard to find the voters watching TV when you'd like them to be," Niven said. "Both sides looked at Ohio as a proving ground and perhaps the Republicans somewhat more desperately, thinking if they can't save Ohio they can't possibly hold the Senate." Niven said TV viewers, especially those in Ohio who see an onslaught of television ads each election year, have become savvy at tuning out TV spots by leaving the room, muting the volume or surfing their phones during commercials. Internet techniques are more difficult to avoid. Portman's campaign, for instance, has created different audiences around the state, delivering each a different online message. Search tools from Google elevate Portman's website, and sites negative toward Strickland, in web searches — and data mining allows ineffective ad message to be quickly pulled and replaced. "We met with Google's analysts and political team in January 2015 and committed to run a data-driven, tech-savvy campaign that would involve Google analysts in everything we do," said Portman campaign manager Corry Bliss. "Working with the Google team has allowed us to run and target multiple messages at any given time across Ohio and contrast Rob's accomplishments for Ohio families with Ted Strickland's failures as governor." The Strickland campaign said it also is heavily using the most innovative digital advertising strategies. "We use digital micro targeting in conjunction with our data and analytics to ensure we're reaching the right voters with the most persuasive argument, and we're communicating with voters who may not be watching television by placing content on websites like Pandora," spokesman David Bergstein said. "If Senator Portman thinks Google can help him win, he obviously hasn't Googled his own record."

If Today Really Is Your Birthday… Which It Isn’t. by Maddy Myers | 11:53 am, September 27th, 2016   When is Google’s birthday, really? Doesn’t seem like they know. In theory, it’s today, since today’s the day that Google posted their own celebratory birthday doodle on the Google search homepage. However, if you click on that doodle, it’ll spark a Google search asking, “When is Google’s birthday?” I guess Google is cool with us finding out that there’s no concrete answer to that question, since their own search engine results bring us right to the heart of this humorous controversy. Although September 27th (today!) has been demarcated as the site’s official birthday this year, as it has been for the past ten years, that wasn’t always the case. Google celebrated their 2005 birthday on September 26th. In 2004, they told us all their birthday was on September 7th. In 2003, they claimed September 8th. None of these seem like the right day, anyway. The company was officially founded on September 4th in 1998. So why not celebrate their birthday on that day? And why move it to such a late day in September? Mirror‘s coverage of Google’s mysteriously-moving birthday speculates that part of the problem is rooted in Google’s beef with Yahoo back in 2005. In September of that year, Yahoo bragged that their search index was bigger than Google’s. Google managed to successfully deflect attention from Yahoo by announcing their “birthday” on September 26th, and also using said “birthday” to announce their new, expanded search index on that day. As we all know, Google’s house party has been the hottest on the ‘net ever since. (Poor Yahoo!) That still doesn’t explain why Google’s birthday changed multiple times even before the Yahoo tiff back in 2005, though. Google’s official explanation, back in 2006: “Google opened its doors in September 1998. The exact date when we celebrate our birthday has moved around over the years, depending on when people feel like having cake.” I guess we’ll never know their real birthday. All I know is, you can’t Google it. Just kidding. It’s totally September 4th. Happy belated birthday, Google. (via The Next Web, image via Google) Want more stories like this?

By Owen Hughes September 27, 2016 16:56 BST Google's new Chromecast Ultra can stream in 4KVenturebeat This could be our first look at the new Chromecast Ultra, Google's new 4K-capable streaming dongle, expected to land on 4 October when we're also likely to see the company's new smartphones alongside a line-up of other Google-made hardware. The leaked pictures come from Venturebeat, which claims that the Chromecast Ultra will retail for around $70 (£54, €62) and will be sold alongside Google's standard £30 Chromecast. Much like its predecessor, the Chromecast Ultra will be capable of turning regular TVs into internet-enabled smart sets by plugging them into an HDMI port and using built-in WiFi to deliver content via apps. Whereas the regular Chromecast can only manage 1080p output, Chromecast Ultra will offer roughly four times the pixel count with resolution of 3840 x 2160. Provided, of course, you have a 4K television. This comes as 4K content is seeing a significant rise with movies to television shows being recorded in the picture format. G-unit Chromecast Ultra no longer carries the Chromecast logo and has instead been replaced with Google's 'G' logo, much as we've seen adorning the Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones in recent leaks. The dongle is tipped to run firmware version 1.21 out of the box, which recently began rolling out to members of Google's Chromecast Review program for testing and is also reported to have eradicated all signs of the Chromecast logo. IBTimes UK will be reporting live from Google's Pixel unveiling on 4 October, where we also hope to catch sight of Google Home and a Daydream VR headset or two.

By Stephanie Condon for Between the Lines | September 27, 2016 -- 15:30 GMT (08:30 PDT) | Topic: Enterprise Software As companies like Google, Microsoft, and Salesforce compete for enterprise business, they're increasingly offering customers a wide range of integrated productivity tools, rather than siloed applications. Google, however, seems to be missing one key piece: customer relations management (CRM). What's Hot on ZDNet When will Microsoft end support for your version of Windows or Office? GE Digital builds up its global presence with acquisitions, partnerships ​Domino's claims world-first pizza drone delivery Microsoft delivers test builds of Visual Studio for Mac, Visual Studio 2017 for Windows For that, it's turned to ProsperWorks, a cloud-based CRM platform built expressly for Google Apps for Work. Linking its future to Google's enterprise business, ProsperWorks has done well for itself so far, growing its revenue 504 percent year-over-year and attracting 63,000 businesses. On Tuesday, the company announced it's secured $24 million in Series B funding, enabling its plans to expand internationally and build a data science team that will transform its CRM from a database to effectively a virtual VP of sales. "We want to be able move CRM from being just a database to a system that tells you what to do next," CEO Jon Lee told ZDNet. The funding round is led by Next World Capital, with additional financing from Storm Ventures, True Ventures, Industry Ventures, Devoteam, and a consortium of strategic angels. ProsperWorks' total funding now stands at $34 million. "Stage One" of the business was developing a CRM product that, through automated data entry and integration with Google productivity apps, ensures data quality and comprehensiveness. Stage Two, he said, is helping sales teams find the connections between their actions and their performance and, ultimately, to give sales teams advice on how to close deals. For instance, Lee explained, the system may tell a salesperson, "You've only done seven phone calls to this customer, you need to do eight more." While ProsperWorks will be using its new funding to build out its data science team, it's also leveraging Google's machine learning platform, meeting with their team on a weekly basis. "Where we can leverage third party tools, we're 100 percent Google," Lee said. Hitching its fate to Google as the internet giant ramps up its enterprise business may be the best way for a relatively small CRM company to go up against Salesforce and other dominant players in the market. More than 5 million businesses use Google Apps, and ProsperWorks is uniquely positioned to capitalize on their growth. In turn, ProsperWorks gives Google the ability to stay competitive with Salesforce as the CRM giant encroaches on its space -- the company's acquisition of the productivity platform Quip expands Salesforce's offerings in word processing and collaborative communications. Meanwhile, Microsoft's recent LinkedIn acquisition gives it the data to improve its own Dynamics CRM. Both of those companies are also offering more intelligent sales and marketing services -- Salesforce recently announced its Einstein platform, while Microsoft's expanded partnership with Adobe combines its AI investments with Adobe's Marketing Cloud data. "Everyone is recognizing sales software is a massive market," Lee said. As to whether Google would acquire ProsperWorks, Lee said, "We work so closely with Google, we're almost a part of it already." In the meantime, ProsperWorks is also using its new capital to build its sales and marketing teams, both domestically and internationally. The company is expanding its business abroad for the first time, starting in Europe -- the second largest market behind the US by total IT spend. One of its investors, Devoteam, is the largest IT systems integrator in Europe.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search Google low-bandwidth modes for YouTube and Chrome testing now Eric Abent - Sep 27, 2016 0 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Google has announced that it will soon be offering low-bandwidth options for some its more popular apps within India. These low-bandwidth modes are coming to services like YouTube, Chrome, Google Play, and Google News, making them more accessible users who may not have access to the fastest internet connections or are limited severely in what they can do online by low data caps, which is a prevalent issue throughout the country. Google’s low-bandwidth YouTube solution is actually an entirely new app called YouTube Go. The company says that this is a product of a year’s worth of a research on India residents and their data needs, and it allows them to play YouTube videos “smoothly” despite slow internet speeds. It also aims to give users better control over their data consumption while watching YouTube videos, which will definitely be a plus. YouTube Go sounds like it could launch in more regions besides India, but at first, the app will only be available for testing there. At the moment, there isn’t any word on whether or not those tests will spread to other areas of the world. On the Allo front, Google Assistant – which fields questions from users and is currently only available in English – will soon be getting support for Hindi. The same goes for Allo’s Smart Replies feature, with Google saying that Hindi support for both should go live later this year. Chrome will be getting a few low-bandwidth features of its own, with an update incoming for its Data Saver mode. Once this update is applied, Chrome will support MP4 videos, which Google says can save up to 67% of video data. What’s more, Chrome will now optimize visited web pages when it detects that users are accessing them though a 2G connection. It will also allow users to download a host of items for offline use, whether those are web pages, music, photos, or videos. Google Play is getting a couple of new features that may seem small in comparison to the changes coming to the rest of the Google roster, but will be important nonetheless. Google says that the Play Store will now load the more important parts of the storefront while the user is connected to Wi-Fi, hoping that translates to a smoother browsing experience even when on a slow connection. In addition to that, users can now also save data by making use of a “wait for Wi-Fi” feature when they’re installing a new app. Rolling out this week is a new feature for Google News and Weather called “Lite Mode.” Lite Mode trims the fat from Google News, so to speak, presenting users with headlines and not much else so they can load News pages faster. Even better is that it, like a lot of the other features rolling out today, will automatically take over when slow connections are detected. Also announced today was the expansion of Google Station, which got its start in India last year. Through a partnership with Indian Railways and RailTel, Google has equipped 50 different stations with Wi-Fi hotspots, with plans to expand that to 400 stations throughout India. Today signals the intention to move that service beyond both railway stations and India, with Google Station giving partners the opportunity to set up Wi-Fi zones in a number of public places. So, there’s a lot of new features centered around giving low-bandwidth users a hand rolling out in the coming weeks and months. One can hope that these features make their way outside of India at some point in the future, and if these tests prove to be successful, we just might see them launch in other regions around the world.

Written by Christopher Groskopf Obsession Language September 27, 2016 Can we teach computers to ignore gender? (Flickr/DaveBleasdale) Share Written by Christopher Groskopf Obsession Language September 27, 2016 Machine learning algorithms, such as those that power Google’s search or Apple’s Siri, learn by extracting information from large amounts of text, images, or other data. Unfortunately, research has shown that these algorithms not only learn to understand language, they also learn to replicate human biases, including implicit biases that humans aren’t even aware of. In July, researchers from Boston University and Microsoft Research published results of an attempt to forcefully remove bias from the language model (pdf) created by a machine learning algorithm. The new technique, which they refer to as “debiasing,” promises to eliminate linguistic bias without altering the meaning of words. This is accomplished by identifying gender stereotypical analogies learned by the algorithm, such as “man is to computer programmer as woman is to homemaker,” and then subtly shifting the relationship between those words. Inappropriate gender stereotypes generated by a machine learning algorithm. “She is to sewing as he is to carpentry.” (Bolukbasi, et al.) The exact mechanism by which these changes are made can be a bit difficult to grasp. If you imagine every word learned by the algorithm seated in a concert hall, debiasing attempts to rearrange the words in their seats, such that the distances between “woman,” “man,” and “computer programmer” are equalized, but the distances between all other related words stay approximately the same. This last step is essential, because if a single word were to move from the balcony to the orchestra pit, it would fundamentally alter the computer’s understanding of what that word means. Previous research has suggested that removing gendered associations, if taken to extremes, would inevitably lead the computer to misunderstand us. Imagine the confusion in our search results if Google didn’t understand that king implies a man and queen implies a woman. In a blog post written by James Zou, one of the co-authors of the July study, he describes the importance of maintaining those appropriately gendered analogies. The new process skips over those sorts of relationships, leaving them unchanged in the final model. It remains to be seen if techniques such as this one can be successfully generalized. (The researchers only tested fairly blatant gender stereotypes.) It’s particularly difficult to predict breakthroughs in machine learning, because surging investment has kicked off a period of incredibly rapid innovation. This study provides hope that some of those R&D dollars might be spent ensuring new algorithms are fair, as well as effective.

The company is no stranger to working in India, with its railroad station Wi-Fi project already proving to be a notable success. But today it announced a series of new products and projects squarely aimed at the Indian market, signaling its intent to tap a market of 1.25 billion people where only 200 or 250 million are currently online. Most notable among the announcements is a new YouTube app called Go, specially designed for users in developing countries with poor—and expensive—data connections. While the app does allow video downloads for later viewing, that’s not its real party trick. Instead, as Wired explains, it allows people to share video with others in their community using ad-hoc wireless networks, so users don’t have to chew through cellular data allowances. That feature was inspired by trips to India, where Google saw people sharing videos not as links, but via SD cards that were passed around. In partnership with Google, Indian Railways' RailTel offers free Wi-Fi Internet service in Mumbai's central railway station. The service is due to be rolled out in 100 of the country's busiest stations by the end of 2016. The app isn’t the only data-saving scheme Google’s been working on. It’s also announced that Chrome for Android will now provide a Data Saver mode that will allow it to more aggressively compress audio and video, as well as downloading a specially streamlined version of Web pages. It’s claimed that MP4 files can be streamed using 67 percent less data, while a Web page ends up just 10 percent of the size. There will also be the option to download Web pages for later viewing. Clearly, there will be a loss of quality—but that probably doesn’t matter too much when you’re using a slow 2G connection. Elsewhere, Google has also announced that it’s expanding its rail station Wi-Fi initiative, known as Google Station, into other locations such as cafes and malls, with plans to take it to other countries. And the company will be adding Hindi support to its new AI-powered Assistant. You may, of course, be reading this and thinking that these features seem useful anywhere, and not just in underconnected countries like India. Google would agree. Writing in the Economic Times, Google CEO Sundar Pichai explains that the company is learning a lot from its work in the country, finding that many of its solutions to connectivity issues—such as Maps Offline—are also popular in the West. “In an increasingly mobile-first world, India gives us early insights into the future of the Internet,” he explains. But make no mistake: India is a huge opportunity for Google. If Google can be the one to provide the services that new Internet users adopt, it will be able to recoup its investments using its favorite trick of all—advertising. Facebook has already tried as much in India with its Free Basics scheme, but that was banned because it breached the principles of net neutrality. Google, though, looks set to do everything it can to succeed.

Jason Cipriani/CNET The internet really, really wants you to register to vote 0 Share: Tech Culture by Alfred Ng September 27, 2016 11:47 AM PDT @alfredwkng Up Next President Obama slams fake news for eroding democracy On the top websites in the US, you'll see the same theme. Internet titans Google, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and Reddit are banding together to get out the vote this November. With tens of millions of views every day, these five sites -- along with up to 4,000 other organizations -- will be urging Americans to register to vote. The effort comes a day after Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton sparred in their first presidential debate. Google got a head start on the National Voter Registration Day internet blitz. Its Doodle on Monday showed users a simple and effective tool for getting registered. The movement started after 2008, when 6 million people couldn't vote because they were unaware of how to register, according to Matt Singer. He's the founder of National Voter Registration Day, which takes place the fourth Tuesday of September, and a proponent of a widespread web presence. Enlarge Image On September 26, Google used its Doodle to push for voter registration. Photo by Google "We want everyone to celebrate," Singer said in an interview. "A lot of web platforms are known for having a young audience, like Tumblr, but ... I think everyone in America uses Google." Tumblr joined the push with a link directly to a voter registration page featured on the right side of its dashboard. Silicon Alley companies like AOL, Bitly, Foursquare and Kickstarter banded together through the hashtag #TechTurnsOut, reaching out in real life to New Yorkers in a concerted effort to increase voter registration. Apps like DoorDash also joined in the effort, by delivering voter registration information straight to users' doorsteps, when it usually delivers meals. The delivery app is available in San Francisco, New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and Denver. Based in Washington, DC, Phone2Action rolled out its Civic Action Center tool, that lets users check their voter registration status, register to vote, vote early and find polling sites. Enlarge Image Facebook gets in on the voter registration action. Photo by Screenshot by Laura Martínez/CNET It's a rare occasion when a number of the country's top websites are singing in harmony. In 2012, Google, Wikipedia, Reddit and other pages "blacked out" in a protest against the Stop Online Piracy Act. Here's how the internet is banding together to help get out the vote: Google: Google's registration tool includes options for registration and deadlines on when to get that done, based on your state. This year, for the first time, the search engine giant added voter registration information in Spanish. Facebook: The social network's millions of active US users have already seen a post pinned to the top of their feeds encouraging users to register to vote. The push rolled out September 23, showing users above the age of 18 how to register, along with all their friends who have already registered. YouTube: The video giant has campaigned heavily for its users to register to vote, using the hashtag #voteIRL. It has teamed up with channels like the Young Turks and The Fung Bros to get its viewers to vote and has been pushing videos that are one minute and 34 seconds -- the average time it takes to register to vote. It also tweaked its logo to include the hashtag. Twitter: Users on Twitter will be able to join in the conversation and tell their friends and followers #iRegistered with the social network's official hashtag. The post comes with a custom emoji showing an American flag top hat with 2016 under it. Twitter is also hosting a kick-off event in Washington, DC, at 8:30 a.m. ET, with its vice president of public policy and philanthropy, Colin Crowell. #NationalVoterRegistrationDay is also trending on Twitter. Reddit: The politics subreddit of the "Front Page of the Internet" is hosting an Ask Me Anything on how to register to vote as well as issues that young people are concerned about. The subreddit is teaming up with Rock the Vote for its step-by-step guide. Snapchat: The voter registration app TurboVote is teaming up with Snapchat on Stories and Discover pages to help users get with the vote. Celebrities like Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson and Jimmy Fallon will be featured on Snapchat's stories to help users learn how to register to vote. Pandora: The internet radio site has partnered up with HeadCount, encouraging listeners to register to vote off its mobile platform with messages from artists like The National and Dispatch. The call to action points out that users can register to vote in less than a minute -- before their songs are even finished. Updated at 10:19 a.m. and 11:47 a.m. PT: Includes more details on organizations participating in National Voter Registration Day.

LEAD This Is Why 2017 Will Be the Year of SEO for Your Startup If you're not deploying SEO tactics as part of your in-house talent attraction strategy, you should be. Here are six top reasons why. By Bryan Adams Bryan Adams is the author of Inbound Marketing book, ‘Getting Goosebumps’, as well as the CEO & founder of the award winning digital marketing agency Ph.Creative. @Bryan_phc Founder and CEO, Ph.Creative@Bryan_phc WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement The field of digital talent attraction is evolving quickly, but many believe recruitment overall lags behind other more sophisticated digital industries. As CEO of a mature digital marketing agency, which specializes in recruitment across a vast array of sectors, I'm inclined to vehemently agree. Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is hailed as the tour de force of many digital businesses. While it is frequently bandied about the recruitment industry, it remains elementary by comparison. Many companies recognize its value in making direct hires but do not have the expertise to take full of advantage of it. In 2017, however, I predict this is going to change. As digital recruitment marketing continues to advance, here are six reasons SEO will soar to the top of the agenda for many in-house recruitment teams: 1. Significantly reduced cost per hire What's the biggest job board in the world? Google, right? Businesses that succeed in ranking high on Google above competitors, job sites and recruitment agencies will attract a much greater volume of applications directly to their website. Consistently receiving these direct applications will translate into continually reduced cost per hire. SEO will help businesses own broad terms, such as "banking jobs London", as well as specific terminology, while ranking regularly and reaping the monetary rewards. Using just basic tools to track where your website traffic is coming from such as Google Analytics will also make it easier to measure cost per hire too. 2. Sustainable talent pooling opportunities As businesses begin to rank for hard-to-fill roles, or positions they hire for time and again, they will also start building their own sustainable talent pool. This will further decrease costs and time spent searching for suitable candidates. 3. Increased reach and impact of social media content That there has been widespread uptake of businesses using social media and branded content to attract direct applications, is nothing new. Content, for example, is a tried and tested method of engaging new candidate personas and drawing them into opportunities. However, the SEO for recruitment value is often either overlooked or simply not carried out well enough to maximize its full potential. Businesses need to optimize these assets so that they rank highly, are easily discoverable, and will continue to add value for many months--and even years--to come. This process will also assist in attracting external links straight to a business's own careers section, boosting the effectiveness of its overall strategy. 4. Greater control over candidate experience The more in control businesses are of what their potential candidates see at every step of the candidate experience, the more they can design the experience to be positive, on-brand and purposeful. World-class candidate experience starts the moment a potential candidate is introduced to the employer brand; if it's via a job board or third party, it can be less than impressive. 5. Not knowing the basics is a big risk Even if SEO is not part of the wider talent attraction strategy, not having a handle on the basic SEO components can harm the performance of a business' career website. Take duplicate content, for instance. If other, more authoritative competitors or job boards are using the same content (like job descriptions), search engines might issue harsh penalties and even deny ranking future job vacancies. 6. Opened doors to SEO opportunities A growing volume of search engine traffic comes from people using mobile devices. Recruitment businesses that ignore SEO are therefore risking losing out on exposure to new candidates - and exciting new formats that engages them. The recent introduction of Google AMP, for example, means simplified content that is specifically submitted in Google's new 'AMP' format will stand a much higher chance of ranking above traditionally coded web pages. Competitive search phrases that for many businesses seem like a pipe dream could therefore become much more achievable. Of course, sometimes these marginal gains don't last long before competitors catch up, however the short-term benefits could make a real difference to recruitment challenges and goals across the year. So you see, there are more reasons to seek advice with your SEO than not. In fact, to ignore it means risking being left behind. With subtle expert changes and the addition of regular SEO resource, even in small quantities, hiring challenges could be dramatically decreased. It would bring the entire industry in-line with the rest of its digital cohort. My advice is to undertake an SEO audit of your careers website to see how you rank amongst your competition. Start to give serious consideration to factoring SEO into your plans for 2017 or risk losing valuable ground within search engines.

Nasty Woman? Trump’s Scorched Earth Tactics Have Little Upside Advocates Fear What Trump Presidency Will Mean for People with Disabilities Published September 27, 2016 Search may indicate intention. By Sheryl Estrada During the first televised presidential debate between Hillary Clinton and Trump on Monday, searches for the phrase “registrarse para votar,” or “register to vote” in Spanish, spiked, hitting an all-time high upward to more than 100,000 searches. According to the Washington Post, the term was Google’s third spiking or trending search in the U.S. at 10:30 p.m. The search volume for “registrarse para votar” on Google was highest in Florida, followed by New Jersey, New York, Texas and California. The search was preceded only by two phrases related to the Houston shooting. The last comparable spike during the current election cycle happened on Aug. 31. That was the day Trump made his speech in Phoenix on immigration: “This election is our last chance to secure the border, stop illegal immigration, and reform our laws to make your life better,” Trump said. Related Story: Trump to ‘Suspend immigration,’ Proposes Ideological Tests for Immigrants The search volume also increased after both the Republican and Democratic conventions in July. A Pew Research Center survey issued in July found Latinos are more likely to vote for Clinton, giving the former secretary of state a 66-24 percent advantage over Trump. After the first presidential debate in 2012, the search for “registrarse para votar” spiked as well. According to national exit polls conducted after the 2012 election, President Barack Obama garnered 71 percent of the Latino vote (Romney received 27 percent). Obama’s national vote share among Latinos was the highest for a Democratic candidate since 1996, according to an analysis of the exit polls by Pew. Google announced on Monday it has expanded its voter information guides in Google Search to Spanish: “We’ve already added in-depth information in Search for registration and how to vote, and now we’re adding this same information in Spanish. Now both Spanish and English speakers will be able to get custom, state-by-state information on key registration deadlines, when to get to the polls, and even steps on how to vote early or by mail. We hope this feature helps simplify the registration process for more American voters.” Share this: Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Tags: election 2016 Google Hillary Clinton Latinos registrarse para votar Trump voting Author: Sheryl Estrada 7 Comments Lee 09/27/2016 11:53 am In a perfect traditional presidential political cycle, advocacy groups such as those working to register eligible Latino voters wouldn’t need to put forth an effort to help their candidate because the racist/sexist opponent is that much disliked. And for this reason the standards are low for Trump and high for Clinton. Hillary simply is a weak candidate, period!!! Last night debate she should have laid him rest. But oddly enough she fumbled in providing clear and strong responses and rebuttals to some of the topics as did Trump. Her opponent is not a career politician, however she is. There’s no way this race should be as close as it is if it weren’t for inability to properly maneuver through an election. She may serve well in office but she’s terribly awful running for it. She and her husband’s ignorance, elitist and racist attitudes is her Achilles heel. http://nypost.com/2016/09/18/black-voters-are-turning-from-clinton-to-trump-in-new-poll/ Reply Luke Visconti 09/27/2016 12:06 pm I’m not sure – trump surprised me last night by emphasizing the phrase “law and order”, a Nixon era phrase which roughly translated means “shoot Black people”. He also reiterated just how horribly Black people are doing, which, in my mind is him saying “white man’s burden”. This in a week where we had two men shot by police, one clearly unarmed, the other certainly not threatening – and the subsequent protests. So what I think he really meant was we need to shoot more Black people to put ‘those people’ in their place. trump has NEVER cared about Black or Latino people. The mighty self-described billionaire cannot point to a decades long or even five minute long record of supplier diversity efforts, diversity in his management team or philanthropy. There’s no trump scholarship I can find. I was a trustee of an historically Black college for ten years. I am currently chair of an HSI university foundation board. Never heard of a trump outreach at any public or private HBCU or HSI. No, the only record we have of the orange fraud is his daddy’s KKK membership, the discrimination settlements, the racist comments and the only Black friend he has, the detestable Omarosa, to stand up for him. Reply Lee 09/27/2016 1:48 pm For me four things are happening and is why things are working in Trump’s favor despite his hiccups, and intentional non politically correct view points. 1. People expect those type of statements from Trump. This is why the expectation is so low for him. They anticipate the overt language and cultural GOP obligatory dog whistles spewed from the right. There’s been numerous examples of White supremacist ties to Trump with relatives and current supporters. And don’t forget about the taxes, sexist and overall craziness of this man shown before lights and cameras. He understands how to entertain the people while keeping them at bay from the truth. 2. Clinton carries way too much baggage as an established elected official and government insider moving into the general election and she’s just not a politically athletic candidate like past others who have a knack for adapting during elections (starting the birther incident in 2008, 1994 Crime Bill targeting Blacks and Latinos, the way she handled emails as an executive cabinet member with her private server, the Clinton Foundation, private investments in corporate prisons, ignoring and dismissing BLM protesters, corporate Wall Street relationships proven and pointed out by Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, influencing Haiti to reject a minimum wage increase for its citizens) 3. She doesn’t like running in elections. She’s simply awkward and is not good at it. 4. The electorate is simply thirsty for leadership. Anyone who screams the loudest appears to be the one in charge. “People want leadership, Mr. President, and in the absence of genuine leadership, they’ll listen to anyone who steps up to the microphone. They want leadership. They’re so thirsty for it they’ll crawl through the desert toward a mirage, and when they discover there’s no water, they’ll drink the sand.” – The American President 1995 Reply Luke Visconti 09/27/2016 1:58 pm Because the bloated orange prevaricator has conditioned us to expect nonsense and his opponent is inept (how can this campaign be tied??), we are not relived of our duty as citizens. We must elect Hillary. Her opponent is a dangerous fraud. Reply L Nevarez 09/27/2016 6:56 pm What I found ridiculous about the discrimination settlement issue was trump’s comment that they did not admit fault in the settlement. So what! Just because you don’t say “sorry, I did it” doesn’t mean you didn’t do it. Those discrimination law suits were filed for a reason. Given his racist, divisive, discriminatory comments; I would feel confident saying he absolutely was at fault in the suits filed against him for discriminatory practices. Reply Luke Visconti 09/28/2016 10:32 am I have no doubt about it. The trump family certainly has/had enough money to fight. Pragmatically, it’s often best to come to an agreement, but it’s a shame when the government allows an ambiguity to stand. Ultimately, it was the trump family’s decision to settle. That has consiquences. I had a former employee (I fired) retaliate against me by filing a grievance against me with the EEOC. I could have settled, but since I knew I was innocent, I ground my way through the two year process and was exonerated. NOT GUILTY. Cost more money and far more time than settling, but I refused to allow an ambiguity to smudge my reputation. I’d assume the trump family couldn’t care less about its reputation with Black people at the time. Now that the son of the KKK member and the father of the big game hunters wants something from Black people (their vote), it matters. Black and Latino people will decide this election. We have a choice between an unstable fraud racist and a woman who refuses to forthrightly address the issues consuming our nation at the direct expense of our Black and Latino citizens. Not good. I think the fraud is going to win. She’s too isolated to hear the truth and too insecure to evolve. Reply Vesima 09/27/2016 10:26 pm This Lee person is a rambling imbecile with Trump on the brain. What gibberish is he spewing. Seriously cringe worthy. Reply Leave a Reply Click here to cancel reply.

Start Learn more about Bootstrap and Material Design Bootstrap In 2011, group of Twitter engineers decided to create Bootstrap as a inside solution for their programing problems. Technically, their plan was to create a tool without of certain code structure. Each coder may have their own way of creating his artworks. This usually leads to some sort of uncertainties when another programmer, lets say a beginner, tries to read through the code. Because of that, Mark Otto and Jacob Thorton from Twitter designed Bootstrap - a way of convincing programmers to unify their patterns of writing the code, and avoid creating differences in the process. The benefits that Bootstrap brought to their daily work were simply invaluable. When guys from Twitter realised its true potential, they have decided to release it as a open-source project. With the help of Github and thousands of other programmers, it took only few months to brand Bootstrap as most popular front-end development tool for creating responsive, mobile web projects. So what exactly is Bootstrap? Imagine it as a toolbox containing a series of useful functions and elements that might be helpful in the process of creating your own website. It makes you able to choose from whatever tool you like, and you can be sure that none of these elements will collide with each other. It is like fitting puzzle pieces together, but in this case, every puzzle goes with another. The tools you have imagined in our Bootstrap toolbox are basically HTML, CSS and JS all mixed together. Material Design for Bootstrap is the best example of how Bootstrap is constantly being under development and how much you can add to it with the help of design and functionality patterns from Google Material Design. Material Design Material Design is a design language, originated from Google, which is intensively used in interfaces’ projects for the Android system. You may ask why it is used. The answer is simple – already a mature and organized tool which corresponds to the usability and legibility. Moreover, it is developing and changing dynamically. The result is the tool that may be a perfect match for screens, as well as the beginning point for unexperienced people in UI/UX designing. The basis of MD are already well-established by website and UI/UX designers who have worked on it since a long time. What distinguishes it from other tools, is the fact you may use it in every kind of project you are currently working on, because it is easy to find recommended practices in each project set. The conventions place emphasis on: Materials as a metaphor - in this context, it is a metaphor of space for sheet and ink. The real things that are used in this tool, are light and space, supported by unique space attributes that distinguish in digital forms field. The characteristics of MD are the shadows which are widespreaded. It reflects the behavior of real things that exist in reality Meaning - the incentive of MD is designing for printing what reflects in very well designed grid, the importance of typography and colours. Movement & Animation - MD not only supports a static form of printing design, but also includes the digital media, basing it on the laws of physics. It gives us the possibility to reconcile utility with aesthetics what is very important nowadays. One of the most important metaphors in MD, is material which has its own position in space on Z axis, so we can tell if it is closer or farther from a user. The metaphor refers to so-called Elevation value. What is interesting, it is the fact this value simulates higher and lower positions in space by properly selected shading. What else is important in Material Design attributes? - Distinctive and well-chosen colours - Simple and easy-to-use icons - Graphics and images that are the additional benchmark for the content - Simple, but at the same time elegant typography based on Roboto font About Material Design Material Design (codenamed Quantum Paper) is a design language developed by Google.

The recent launch of Digital India program has been one of the key factors that has given this a boost. Google has been doing its part as well and had announced an official partnership with RailTel to offer free Wi-Fi access on major railway stations last year. Today at the second edition of Google for India, the company gave us the report card and it looks quite positive. Since the launch, about 52 railway stations in India now offer public Wi-Fi. More stations across the country are going to be added and Google hopes to enable 100 stations by the end of this year. About 15,000 new users are said to come online every day with close to 3.5 million active users every month. Taking the initiative further, a new platform called Google Station was announced today. This aims at extending public Wi-Fi to places such as malls, schools, restaurants, shops and more. Google seeks to partner with these location and venue owners so they can work with Google to set up efficient and easy to access Wi-Fi. While Google will handle all the installation and setup, the location owners will get an option to monetise Google Station hotspots by including an access charge and offer ads, or just keep them free. This will surely encourage more venue owners to set up public Wi-Fi as Google Station will not only attract more customers in need of the internet but they will also get a chance to advertise themselves as well as earn extra dough for letting people use their Wi-Fi. It will also improve the public Wi-Fi scenario in the country as currently cafes, food joints and other places offer limited and unreliable internet access.

SUBSCRIBE Content and SEO: Building linkable content What makes content link-worthy? Columnist Andrew Dennis discusses the qualities that make content easy to promote and share. Andrew Dennis on September 27, 2016 at 9:56 am More In March, Google Search Quality Senior Strategist Andrey Lipattsev stated that Google’s two top ranking factors are content and links. Content and links have a symbiotic relationship: great content attracts links, and links improve the visibility and popularity of content. However, not all types of content will attract links, and even content types that typically attract links require strategic promotion in order to secure those links. What makes content linkable? There are numerous types of content: blog posts, articles, white papers, eBooks, listicles, videos, photographs, case studies and more. But not all types of content are link-worthy. It makes sense — different content should serve different purposes (awareness, education, conversion and so on). Therefore, if links are a goal in your marketing strategy, you should have content planned to secure links. Creating content alone isn’t enough. You can’t build it and expect the links to come. You need a link strategy. The first step to creating linkable content is to understand why people link on the web. Then, when you’re planning your next piece of content, ask yourself the question, “Why would anyone link to this content?” Your answer should guide your content promotion strategy. What makes content link-worthy? People typically link to content because they find the content useful, entertaining, unique, insightful or valuable. Another important aspect of link-worthiness worth remembering (that doesn’t necessarily pertain to content format or type) is site, brand and publisher reputation. Google uses links as a signal of trust in their algorithm because people tend to link to trusted authorities online. Authoritative sites also typically have larger audiences and visibility, making it easier to acquire links. If your site is relatively unknown, you may need to devise a strategy to tap into someone else’s audience to aid your link development efforts. With that being said, some content formats are more linkable than others, lending themselves more easily to citation, reference and endorsement. What are some examples of linkable content, and what makes them link-worthy? One example is a recent study by Moz and BuzzSumo that looked at one million articles to analyze the relationship between shares and links. As seen in the screen shot below, this piece of content has earned 2,866 links from 555 referring domains! Many of these links are citations, such as this one from Fox News: Another example of a link-worthy piece of content is AJ Kohn’s post, “RankBrain Survival Guide.” In this post, Kohn does an excellent job of explaining RankBrain in simple and plain terms. Because of the quality of the post — and Kohn’s authority as an experienced marketing executive — he’s secured numerous endorsement links. Majestic data shows that Kohn’s post has garnered 799 links from 69 referring domains: People will also link to content that is authoritative and covers a specific topic in depth when they are referencing said topic. For example, here is an impressive link that Search Engine Land secured on The Washington Post: The author of this article wanted to reference artificial intelligence in Google’s algorithm, but their post is not about this specific topic. Because Search Engine Land covers the topic better than anyone else, the author referenced their resource, and Search Engine Land earned a link. Understanding the fundamental reasons people link is critical to creating link-worthy content. The starting point to craft linkable content is to determine the various reasons that someone might link, and then build those reasons into the content. Promoting content for links isn’t rocket science; it’s good planning. You don’t have to be (as) creative with outreach if you’re strategic before content creation. There are a number of ways to build link-worthiness into content planning: original research/data; expert opinions/quotes; collaboration; and unique imagery/video. Building link-worthiness into content planning — before creating content — will make promotion simple and straightforward. Original research/data One of the best types of content for securing links is original research. Original data earns links because it provides unique information that cannot be attained anywhere else. This means any time a website wants to cite information from your study, they have literally only one source to link to: you. Research is inherently linkable because it is backed by data rather than opinion, making it a natural source of citation (links) from others. As you plan your content strategy, you should consider a new study or test. Of course, unique research shouldn’t be done for the sake of content and links alone. The research should serve a greater purpose: revealing insightful information for your company, providing value across your entire industry and/or answering questions vital to your audience. Research projects are more than a content initiative; they’re a business investment. Obtaining original research and data isn’t easy. Gathering the necessary information can take months to complete, so you need to have a firm list of goals and KPIs attached to your study before you begin research. You need to have answers for all these questions: What questions does my study aim to answer? Will this data make anybody’s job/life easier? Who might be interested in my findings? Does my study build upon a previous study or experiment? What is my hypothesis for how the test will unfold? What if the data is different from what I expect? You should also plan several different content possibilities and angles when it comes to original research, because you won’t have control over the results. If you have a content plan (and contingencies) in place before you launch a study — and you invest the time and effort in collecting accurate data — the original research you gather will help you secure relevant links. Example content: Are Links Still a Powerful Ranking Factor? (New Study) by Eric Enge Eric Enge’s study on links as a ranking factor is a perfect example of how original research can fuel a linkable asset. This study earned Stone Temple Consulting 2,503 links from 199 referring domains. That included this great link on PCWorld: Expert opinions/quotes Featuring expert insight is another option for building strategic, link-earning content. Expert perspectives add legitimacy to your content and tap into the audiences of those experts. This makes your content more authoritative and broadens your audience, both of which improve your ability to secure links. Be selective in who you choose to include. You should take the time to connect with influencers who are qualified and willing to share their personal experiences and insight. Real-life experiences offer more actionable takeaways than tips or best practices. Drawing out these stories usually takes more than a cold email. You need to build real connections. You should also share your content plan and goals with them and explain why your piece will genuinely benefit the greater community. Example content: The Most Creative Link Building Post Ever by Jon Cooper Jon Cooper of Point Blank SEO put together one of the best link-building roundups in the SEO industry. Cooper contacted 50+ legitimate experts from around the industry and asked for their stories on the most creative ways they’ve seen links secured. Cooper combined excellent design and actionable advice to create an awesome link-worthy asset. This roundup post has acquired 3,157 links from 189 referring domains! Collaboration Partnering with other businesses on a content initiative is also an effective method to create link-worthy content. During your content planning process, construct a list of potential partners and map out shared interests and audiences. Once you select a suitable partner, conduct audience research to discover which major pain points your overlapping audience is struggling with, and create content around that topic. Similar to featuring expert insight, collaboration with other industry leaders allows you to tap into a broader audience (again, increasing your number of link prospects). Collaboration also all but guarantees you will receive links from those you’re working with, thereby strengthening your relationship. Building positive connections in your industry also offers benefits beyond links, including: future promotional support; improved industry reputation; new partnership opportunities; brand development; referral business; and increased authority. Working with others pools your resources to create something beyond what either of you can create alone, often resulting in content that is truly best-in-class for your niche, as well as extremely link-worthy. You’ll also benefit from double the promotional efforts, as your collaborative partner has a vested interest in the success of the content. Of course, you have to host the content on your own site to benefit from the links (from an SEO standpoint). As part of your planning process, you need to consider what value your potential partner(s) will receive from collaborating: future content from you, exposure to your audience, future collaborative projects and so on. Example content: We Analyzed 1 Million Google Search Results. Here’s What We Learned About SEO by Brian Dean A great example of a successful collaborative project — and one that earned a large number of links — is Brian Dean’s study of one million search results and the ranking factors behind them. Brian Dean collaborated with a number of people and companies to create this content. Because Dean was able to pool his resources with these other fine folks, he was able to secure a wealth of links to his site, Backlinko. Brian’s post earned 7,376 links from 789 unique referring domains. Unique imagery/video Images and other visual content are often more linkable than dry, text-only content. During content ideation, consider how to inject visual elements into your content to make it more valuable and link-worthy. Some different ways imagery can add value are: Humor. Memes and GIFs help you connect with your audience on a human level, making your content more relatable. Visually striking. Breathtaking photography will often earn links itself, if the imagery is powerful enough. Charts/graphs. Humans are visual learners, and charts and graphs help people better understand the information in your content. Screen shots. Real screen shots lend validity to your content, often making abstract concepts more tangible. Along with images, adding video to your content increases its value. Video provides another medium for your audience to access your content and helps you reach segments of your audience who would rather watch than read. As mobile devices become more ingrained in our lives and mobile usage continues to grow, video content will be important, as people may not want to read long, text-heavy blog posts. Supporting your content with images and video is a value-add that makes your content more link worthy. Example content: Whiteboard Friday by Moz When I think about successful video content, Moz’s Whiteboard Friday series quickly comes to mind. Moz has done an incredible job of building a following and community, and their community appears to enjoy video content; Whiteboard Friday is one of Moz’s most popular features. These videos are also very linkable — Moz’s Whiteboard Friday page has 6,409 links from 380 different referring domains.

SUBSCRIBE How do you deal with local SEO KPIs that don’t pass the smell test? We all know that data can sometimes be unreliable, but columnist Andrew Shotland makes the case for why we shouldn't just rely on free Google tools for data collection and analysis. Andrew Shotland on September 27, 2016 at 9:28 am More Today, let’s talk about reporting local SEO results — specifically, reporting them with the tools Google provides. While proving the value of your work has always been a thing, it seems that lately, more and more businesses are looking for ways to justify their local SEO spend. One of the challenges is that most of the time, particularly with multi-location brands, making sense of the internal and external data can be nearly impossible. My thinking about this topic started off with one of our clients expressing recently that while we appeared to be hitting our organic traffic goals, their boss wasn’t seeing it. Most of their conversions happened over the phone, but thanks to [insert favorite corporate complexities here], they couldn’t tie organic traffic back to phone leads. And so, our client’s boss was looking at Google Analytics and Google Search Console data and not really getting the whole story, even when we took pains to tell it in a very simple way. Just showing rank tracking reports wasn’t really achieving our goal of getting the client’s eyes to not glaze over. Now, before all you call tracking companies start hounding me, let’s get real. If you’re a “national to local” company, you can invest six figures in call tracking alone. We get it, and we love it when clients do, but many of our clients don’t and likely never will. Many local search marketers are starved by their PPC teammates, a corporate culture that doesn’t prioritize SEO (even when it accounts for 40 percent of the revenue), and barely have the budget to update their title tags. So inevitably, the impoverished search marketer turns to Google’s free tools. No sooner had this reporting issue come up when we saw this tweet by our good friends on Twitter over at AttorneySync: TL;DR: Click-through rates from local pack listings seem disproportionately low. https://t.co/ni7vz7fALc — Gyi Tsakalakis (@gyitsakalakis) September 14, 2016 This led to a long Twitter discussion about the precise methods of tracking this data that I’d share if Twitter didn’t make it so damn hard to do so. So let’s put this whole thing to rest using a vivid example from a real client of mine. This should prove once and for all (at least until the next updates) that you need to use your own tracking — because you just can’t trust this free Google stuff when it comes to Local (and probably non-Local, either). All data is from the past 30 days: 1. Google Analytics data: Clicks from Google My Business pages to a location page = 222 If you want to know how to track clicks from your Google My Business URLs in Google Analytics, check this post out. 2. Google My Business Insights data: Views from both Google Search & Maps = 7.99K And let’s not even get started on how you effectively manage this data for hundreds or thousands of locations… 3. Google Search Console data: Total Google My Business page impressions = ~4.9K Because we set up Google My Business (GMB) tracking parameters, we are able to see performance data in the Google Search Console (GSC) Search Analytics report: Wait a minute! Didn’t Google My Business Insights just say that my GMB page had 7.99K impressions? I guess it had 4.79K “Listings on Maps” impressions, so that’s pretty close. But Search Console is (I think) measuring the number of times the website URL connected to my GMB page appeared in Search. And unless it’s showing up in the non-Local Pack “organic” section of the SERPs, why would it be so different from the “Listing on Search” number above? Maybe this means it’s showing up as a Local Knowledge Panel? Or maybe I’m a pretzel. 4. Google Search Console data: Total clicks from GMB page = 169 But I recall that our Google Analytics tracking showed it was 222! Only off by about 30 percent, so you know, directionally it’s… 5. But hey, the Google My Business page got almost 10K “actions” Over here, we call this data the “real CTR” because you can’t measure the performance of a Google My Business page solely by clicks — see above client drama. So, 172 “actions” were visits to website, which I guess is pretty close to 169 — which, as you may recall, was not close to 222. So at least GSC and GMB are consistent… sort of. 6. And total organic search traffic to the URL = 474 When you consider the size of the universe, 474 is basically the same thing as the 396 clicks reported in Google Search Console. What does this all mean? So to recap, our Mayberry landing page got: Google Analytics, clicks from GMB: 222 Google Search Console, clicks from GMB: 169 Google My Business Insights, website visits: 172 Now, don’t think I haven’t been paying attention to your eye-rolling. And lest you think you can pwn me on Twitter: Hey SEO genius, have you never heard of #SamplingError? — ((Andrew Shotland)) (@localseoguide) September 20, 2016 Even if you accept Google as your savior and feel the data is at least directionally correct, glory be to $GOOG, imagine how the sampling error compounds when you aggregate the data for hundreds or thousands of locations. So, at the risk of stating the obvious like a true SEO guru, don’t rely solely on Google (or tools that rely on Google) for measurement. Educate stakeholders at the start of the engagement about how to measure performance. Keep reminding stakeholders that they really need to invest in independent tracking/analytics when they inevitably ignore/forget that you told them this at the start. Hey, give them a break, they’re trying to keep this whole thing afloat with Kleenex and paper clips. If needed, fund a test with your own your own cash to prove that it’s worth the investment. If you’re doing good work, you should see great ROI. Keep telling your story. Without independent tracking, they are going to need constant reminders that this stuff really is doing something. Now, don’t get me wrong. We are big Google fans at Local SEO Guide. We use their tools every day to do our jobs, probably just like you. But over the years, you might say we’ve developed some trust issues: Don’t Trust Google to Structure Your Local Data Stop Believing Google Search Console’s Sitemap Indexation Report Should You Trust Google’s Search Analytics Report?

(AP Photo/David Goldman) .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... ..........WASHINGTON — The Latest on the U.S. presidential race (all times EDT): 11:30 p.m. Former President Bill Clinton and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton say they have “lost a true and treasured friend” with the death of former Israeli Prime Minister and President Shimon Peres. The Clintons say Israel has lost a leader “who championed its security, prosperity and limitless possibilities from its birth to his last day on earth.” Advertisement Continue reading The Clintons are calling Peres “a genius with a big heart who used his gifts to imagine a future of reconciliation, not conflict.” ___ 10 p.m. Hillary Clinton is picking up another Republican endorsement, this time from former Virginia Senator John Warner. Warner is set to appear Wednesday morning with Democratic vice presidential nominee — and current Virginia senator — Tim Kaine in Arlington. Warner served five terms in the Senate and has strong national security credentials. He is a former Navy secretary and Senate Armed Service Committee chairman. Warner’s endorsement strengthens Clinton’s argument that she is better prepared to handle national security and foreign policy than rival Donald Trump. Warner and Clinton served together briefly in the Senate. He retired in 2009. Advertisement Continue reading Clinton’s campaign says this is Warner’s first time endorsing a Democratic presidential nominee. She says she’s honored Warner would trust her “with the weighty responsibility of being Commander in Chief.” ___ 9 p.m. Donald Trump’s campaign and the Republican Party have raised around $18 million following his first presidential debate with rival Hillary Clinton. Trump told a packed crowd at an airplane hangar in Melbourne, Florida, that the total marks his biggest one-day haul of the campaign. Trump says: “They raised almost $18 million today. Can you believe it? And that was largely because of last night.” Trump has been aggressively raising money ahead of the election’s final end-of-quarter fundraising deadline at the end of September. The sum includes money raised through online donations as well as higher-dollar donations from a “National Call Day.” Advertisement Continue reading Trump’s campaign is planning a major investment in advertising from now through Election Day that will require a serious infusion of cash. ___ 7:46 p.m. The self-proclaimed master of massive rally crowds is suggesting that even he was a little intimidated by the audience of millions watching the debate Monday against Hillary Clinton. Trump told supporters in an airplane hangar in Melbourne, Florida, Tuesday that he knew he “was going into a situation where you were going to have one of the largest audiences in the history of television.” He says he “took a deep breath” and “pretended I was talking to my family. It’s very interesting. You just block it out.” The showdown was the most-watched presidential debate ever, with 84 million viewers. The Nielsen company said the viewership toppled a record that had stood for 36 years. More than 80 million people watched the only debate in 1980 between incumbent Democrat Jimmy Carter and Republican challenger Ronald Reagan. Advertisement Continue reading ___ 7:33 p.m. Donald Trump says he was holding back during his debate against Hillary Clinton because he didn’t want to embarrass her. The Republican presidential nominee addressed Monday night’s debate at length for the first time publicly during a Tuesday evening rally in Melbourne, Fla. He was on his heels for much of the night, but proclaimed victory on Tuesday as he faced rowdy supporters in an airport hangar. Trump said that Clinton was “stuck in the past” during the debate. He said she defended “the horrible status quo” for the 90 minute debate-stage clash. He added, “I was also holding back — I didn’t want to do anything to embarrass her.” He previously said he held back to avoid embarrassing the Clintons’ daughter, Chelsea, who also was in the debate audience. Trump’s team said he was planning to bring up Bill Clinton’s infidelities during the debate, but changed his mind. Advertisement Continue reading ___ 6:25 p.m. The Georgia state director for the Donald J. Trump campaign has resigned after his criminal past was revealed. WSB-TV reports that Bibb County sheriff’s deputies arrested Brandon Phillips in 2008 on battery and felony criminal damage. Phillips pleaded guilty to criminal trespassing charges after admitting he destroyed one person’s laptop and slashed another person’s tires. A senior communications adviser for the Republican presidential nominee said in a statement, “Today we accepted the resignation of the Trump-Pence campaign’s Georgia state director Brandon Phillips. Billy Kirkland, our Georgia senior adviser, will continue to lead the campaign’s operations in Georgia.” Phillips was hired on Nov. 2, 2015. ___ 6:07 p.m. Advertisement Continue reading Pennsylvania voter Patricia Bennett says she heard unmistakable sexism in Donald Trump’s challenge of Hillary Clinton’s stamina during the candidates’ first debate. Bennett was one of two dozen female voters from battleground states who spoke with The Associated Press the day after Monday’s first presidential debate. Nearly all had concerns with Trump’s critical comments about women, as well as his aggressive approach to Clinton in the debate. The concerns were shared by some women who plan to vote for Trump in November, though his supporters were more forgiving in their assessment. Clinton has held a lead with women voters throughout her general election contest with Trump. But she needs to widen that margin as much as possible to offset her weakness with men. ___ 3:57 p.m. Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump will share a stage next month — but will trade jokes, not attack lines. Advertisement Continue reading The Archdiocese of New York announced Tuesday that both candidates will both appear at the Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation dinner on October 20. The white-tie event, which raises money for charity, is annually at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York and every four years draws the major parties’ presidential nominees. Traditionally, the candidates sit on either side of Cardinal Timothy Dolan and take turns delivering humorous speeches. Four years ago, President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney traded good-natured barbs and self-deprecating jokes. The dinner will be held just two days after the third and final presidential debate. __ 3:29 p.m. One of Donald Trump’s chief Republican detractors says the GOP presidential candidate performed poorly in Monday’s debate and all but admitted it. Advertisement Continue reading Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake says, “When you blame the mic, that’s as close as you get to conceding that you had a bad night.” Trump said his microphone went on and off during his encounter with Hillary Clinton and was set at a low volume. He said he wondered if the moderators did that purposely, though he offered no evidence. Flake says, “Trump was Trump. Light on substance, heavy on theatrics.” Flake has refused to endorse Trump. The two have criticized each other for months. The senator says Trump missed opportunities to criticize Clinton’s record. He says Trump went down “rabbit holes” by talking about “beauty contestants.” ___ 3:05 p.m. Donald Trump says he will participate in the next two presidential debates. Advertisement Continue reading The Republican presidential contender was asked by reporters about his intentions during a Tuesday afternoon appearance in Miami. He said “sure” when asked by reporters whether he would participate in the subsequent debates. Also on hand was Trump adviser Rudy Giuliani, the former New York City mayor. Giuliani suggested the night before that he would not attend the upcoming debates if he were Trump. Many Republicans believe Democrat Hillary Clinton bested Trump in their first face-off. Trump earlier criticized the debate moderator and complained he had been given a faulty microphone. ___ 2:35 p.m. President Barack Obama is contrasting the two main presidential candidates in the aftermath of their first debate. Obama is calling Hillary Clinton well-respected around the world, serious and someone with a vision of how to put people back to work. Obama admits he’s biased about his former secretary of state. Advertisement Continue reading He says Republican Donald Trump “doesn’t have the preparation, the temperament, or the core values of inclusion” that would take America forward. Obama’s comments came in a radio interview with Ryan Seacrest. It was intended to encourage people to register to vote. Obama said this year’s election is especially important because there are such big differences between the candidates. ___ 2:15 p.m. Donald Trump is describing Monday night’s debate as “an interesting evening.” The Republican presidential nominee briefly addressed his first faceoff with Democrat Hillary Clinton during a Tuesday afternoon appearance near Miami’s Little Havana neighborhood. The audience was largely Cuban-American. Trump said more than 80 million people watched the debate. He said he tried not to think about the large television audience. Advertisement Continue reading He said, “I think we did very well.” He suggested he was the winner in virtually all post-debate polls. That’s despite many Republican leaders and voter surveys suggesting that Clinton came out on top. Trump called it, “a very big moment, a very important moment.” ___ 2:10 p.m. Hillary Clinton is winning applause from supporters in North Carolina for her performance in Monday night’s debate. They greeted the Democratic presidential candidate with cheers on Tuesday after Clinton asked if they saw her first face-off with Republican rival Donald Trump. Clinton says she was happy to have the opportunity to lay out her vision for the United States. She says she has an “old-fashioned idea that if I’m asking for your vote, to actually tell you what I want to do.” Clinton also urged supporters to register to vote. She predicted record turnout in November. Advertisement Continue reading ___ 1:55 p.m. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi is mocking Donald Trump as “Mr. Last Night” and suggests he might not show up for the next debate after an uneven performance on Monday. The California Democrat also told reporters that she feels sorry for Trump and “maybe he’ll get the sympathy vote.” And she brought up his hairstyle, suggesting no female candidate could get away with hair like “whatever his name is, Trump.” Pelosi later claimed to have trouble remembering his name. Pelosi heaped praise on Hillary Clinton’s performance. Of Trump, she said: “That was pathetic so I don’t know that he even shows up again.” ___ 1:35 p.m. Advertisement Continue reading Former Miss Universe Alicia Machado says her experience with Donald Trump “can open eyes” in the presidential election. Trump criticized Machado for gaining weight after she won the pageant in 1996. Hillary Clinton revived Trump’s remarks in Monday night’s debate, using them as an example of how the Republican treats women. Machado spoke with reporters Tuesday in a conference call arranged by the Clinton campaign. She says she was “really surprised” to hear Clinton reference her story in the debate. Machado says she wants to help Clinton in the election. She says, “I’m here for her.” ___ 1:30 p.m. The White House is applauding Hillary Clinton for her debate performance, saying the candidate the president strongly supports is the candidate who performed “quite strongly.” Spokesman Josh Earnest said President Barack Obama watched Monday’s debate from the White House Treaty Room. He said Clinton made a powerful case for building on the economic progress the United States has made during the Obama years in digging out of the biggest downturn since the Depression. Advertisement Continue reading Earnest is also contrasting Republican Donald Trump’s unwillingness to release his tax returns to Obama’s decision to do so as a candidate and as president. Earnest said that transparency is “good for the process and good for voters as they make a really important decision about the future of the country.” ___ 1:05 p.m. Republican vice presidential nominee Mike Pence is meeting with Gov. Scott Walker for debate preparation in Wisconsin. Pence spokesman Marc Lotter says the Indiana governor was to meet with Walker on Tuesday, one week before Pence squares off against Democrat Tim Kaine in their only debate. Walker is standing in for Kaine in Pence’s debate preparation. They have previously held similar mock debate sessions. Pence is also attending a fundraiser in Madison. He has no official public events in Wisconsin on Tuesday. He had previously announced an evening rally in the conservative city of Waukesha, but it was canceled because Donald Trump is going to be there Wednesday night ___ Advertisement Continue reading 12:55 p.m. Former New Hampshire Gov. John H. Sununu is the latest Donald Trump skeptic to back the Republican presidential nominee. Sununu says Trump is the only candidate who can “bring bold change” to Washington. Sununu was White House chief of staff to President George H.W. Bush. The Trump campaign touted Sununu’s endorsement Tuesday, after Sununu introduced vice presidential nominee Mike Pence at a rally Monday in the state. But Democrats are pointing out that Sununu hasn’t always been a fan of Trump. He once told a Bloomberg reporter that Republicans’ chance of winning back the governorship would be hurt by Trump. Sununu’s son, Chris Sununu, is the Republican nominee for governor. ___ Advertisement Continue reading 12:25 p.m. Vice President Joe Biden is questioning Donald Trump’s “moral center” as a result of the Republican presidential candidate’s comments about America’s housing collapse. Biden told a Hillary Clinton rally at Drexel University in Philadelphia on Tuesday that Trump had bragged at Monday’s presidential debate about profiting from the failed housing market. The vice president said Trump “is a guy who said it was good business for him to see the housing market fail.” Biden added, “What in the hell is he talking about?” At the debate, Clinton said Trump had rooted for the housing collapse in 2006 because he saw it as a way to go in and make money. Trump responded, “That’s called business, by the way.” Biden said Trump “brags about gaming the system and bankruptcy.” ___ Advertisement Continue reading 12:15 p.m. FBI Director James Comey says his agency granted immunity to Hillary Clinton’s former chief of staff because agents wanted to inspect her laptop as part of a now-closed FBI investigation into Clinton’s use of a private email server. Comey told a Senate committee on Tuesday that an immunity deal for Cheryl Mills was limited to information contained on her laptop. He added that the FBI’s collective judgment was that “we need to get to that laptop.” Comey told Sen. Ben Sasse, a Republican from Nebraska, that Mills was acting as a member of Clinton’s legal team in the case. He said the FBI decided it would take too long to try to force Mills to turn over the laptop without an immunity deal. The FBI investigated Clinton’s use of a private mail server for official communications while secretary of state, but no charges were filed. ___ 11:30 a.m. House Speaker Paul Ryan is praising Donald Trump’s debate performance, saying he showed he can “go toe-to-toe with Hillary Clinton.” Advertisement Continue reading Ryan said Trump “gave a unique Donald Trump response to the status quo… I think he passed a number of thresholds.” The Wisconsin Republican refused to comment on Trump’s attacks Tuesday morning on a Miss Universe contestant over her weight gain. He said he hadn’t seen Trump’s remarks. Despite Ryan’s positive spin, some other House Republicans voiced some disappointment over Trump’s performance. Some said there were missed opportunities to attack Clinton over her family foundation and other issues that didn’t come up in the debate. Congressman Bill Flores of Texas says Trump “wasn’t quite as consistent as I would’ve liked him to have been.” ___ 11:25 a.m. A senior House Democrat says Donald Trump “came unhinged” during Monday’s debate and demonstrated that he is not qualified to be president. Rep. Xavier Becerra of California, the chairman of the Democratic Caucus, told reporters Tuesday that Trump showed disrespect to Clinton and American voters by constantly “badgering and interrupting” the Democratic presidential nominee. Advertisement Continue reading Becerra said: “Donald Trump essentially showed who he is.” He said: “He gave us a sense of his character and his temperament.” Becerra says Trump “came unhinged” at several points, though the congressman didn’t cite specific examples. He said “that’s the last thing you want for a president who will have his or her finger over the nuclear button.” ___ 11:20 p.m. Hillary Clinton says she’s feeling good after Monday night’s debate and is looking forward to the next two match-ups with Donald Trump. The Democratic presidential candidate said the debate showed “clear differences” between the candidates’ temperaments and qualifications for the presidency. Clinton spoke to reporters Tuesday on her campaign plane. She’s holding a rally and a fundraiser in Raleigh, North Carolina, later in the day. Advertisement Continue reading She said her Republican rival cast the country in “dire and dark terms” and “That’s not who America is.” She couldn’t resist a final dig on Trump as she returned to her seat at the front of the cabin. Trump had complained that he was given a “terrible” microphone during the debate. Clinton said: “Anybody who complains about the microphone is not having a good night.” ____ 10:15 a.m Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine says the presidential debate showed Hillary Clinton has Donald Trump beat when it comes to stamina. Trump doubled down at the end of Monday’s debate on his frequent criticism that Clinton lacks the “stamina” to be commander in chief. She shot back by ticking off the busy schedule she kept as secretary of state. Kaine said Clinton looked like she could have debated for 11 more hours. But he said Trump looked “rattled” and like a boxer leaning on the ropes waiting for a knockout. Advertisement Continue reading Kaine delivered his remarks Tuesday morning at an organizing event in Orlando, Florida. ___ 9:35 a.m. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg is reacting to Donald Trump’s call for the alliance to do more to fight terrorism. He says it has long made fighting terrorism a top priority. Stoltenberg told reporters in Slovakia Tuesday that “NATO has been focused on the fight against terrorism for many, many years and it’s not a result of the U.S. election campaign.” He recalled that NATO activated its collective defense clause known as Article 5 for the first and only time to come to the aid of the United States after the 9/11 attacks. He said: “Thousands of soldiers from European allies and Canada have been in Afghanistan as a direct result of the attacks on the United States.” NATO took command of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan in 2003 Advertisement Continue reading ___ 9:05 a.m. Hillary Clinton apparently has the Google edge after the presidential debate. Google Trends says more people looked up Clinton’s name than Republican Donald Trump’s in all 50 states following Monday’s debate. Google says Trump searches led in the majority of states before the debate. The search giant says users looked up information on both candidates’ stances on immigration, abortion and guns most often while the debate was happening. Many used Google to do their own fact-checking on the candidates’ claims. Google says the top fact check question for Trump revolved around his stance on the Iraq war. For Clinton, users wanted to follow up on her statement that stop-and-frisk police tactics had been ruled unconstitutional. ___ 8:30 a.m. Advertisement Continue reading Donald Trump says he didn’t have the sniffles during the debate. The Republican presidential nominee sounded like he was sniffling — and loudly — through much of the presidential debate Monday, eliciting comments and jokes on social media. The hashtag #sniffle became popular on Twitter. But asked about that in a phone interview Tuesday morning on “Fox & Friends,” Trump denied there was any sniffling. He said the microphone was very bad, “but maybe it was good enough to hear breathing. But there was no sniffles.” He said he doesn’t have a cold or allergies. ___ 8:10 a.m. The two vice presidential candidates unsurprisingly saw their running mates as debate winners. Advertisement Continue reading Democrat Tim Kaine says Donald Trump “looked like he was running out of gas” and Republican Mike Pence accused Hillary Clinton of launching “an avalanche of insults” at Trump. They appeared on morning news shows Tuesday after the first debate between Trump and Clinton. On NBC’s “Today” show, Kaine, said he thought Trump offered few specifics on policies, adding, “I don’t think he was prepared.” Pence countered that Trump was “focused on the issues that the American people care about.” Pence also said he thought Trump came off as an agent for change while Clinton epitomized the Washington “status quo.” Kaine and Pence will appear together in a debate Oct. 4 at Longwood University in Farmville, Virginia. ___ 7:50 a.m. Donald Trump is issuing his report card for Hillary Clinton for her debate performance: C-plus. Advertisement Continue reading Trump also says moderator Lester Holt of NBC News earns a C or a C-plus. He says Holt asked him unfair questions. But Trump isn’t giving himself a letter grade for his performance. He told Fox and Friends on Tuesday that he’s merely that he’s confident he did much better than Clinton in Monday night’s debate. ___ 7:40 a.m. Donald Trump is floating the theory that debate moderators gave him a bad microphone on purpose. Trump says his mic at Monday’s debate was “terrible.” He’s blaming it for what some listeners thought were sniffles by Trump during the debate. Trump said Tuesday on “Fox and Friends” that it was going on and off and that his volume was lower than Hillary Clinton’s microphone. Trump tells Fox News he wonders “whether that wasn’t set up that way on purpose.” He says “I don’t want to believe in conspiracy theories, but it was much lower than hers.” Advertisement Continue reading Trump campaign manager Kellyann Conway told CNN that she heard from audience members that his mic sounded off. She said that from where she sat backstage, the mic sounded fine. ___ 7:20 a.m. Donald Trump says it was a “real problem” when the 1996 Miss Universe gained significant weight after winning the pageant that he formerly owned. Trump is responding to Hillary Clinton’s reference in the first debate to Alicia Machado’s claim that Trump called her “Miss Piggy” when she gained weight. In the debate, Trump repeatedly challenged Clinton over where she had heard that. But Trump told “Fox and Friends” on Tuesday that Machado was “the worst we ever had,” referring to past winners of the pageant. Trump says, “She gained a massive amount of weight. It was a real problem. We had a real problem.” ____ 3:45 a.m. Donald Trump aggressively tried to pin the nation’s economic and national security problems on Hillary Clinton in the first presidential debate, belittling the former senator and secretary of state as a “typical politician” incapable of delivering the change many Americans crave. But Trump found himself on the defensive for much of the 90-minute showdown Monday night. Clinton was thoroughly prepared, not only with detailed answers about her own policy proposals, but also sharp criticism of Trump’s business record, his past statements about women, and his false assertions that President Barack Obama may not have been born in the United States. The Democrat also blasted Trump for his refusal to release his tax returns, breaking with decades of presidential campaign tradition.

Your Right to Know Public records complaint program open for business By Julie Carr Smyth The Associated Press  •  Wednesday September 28, 2016 1:01 AM Enlarge Image Request to buy this photo Fred Squillante | Dispatch file photo U.S. Sen. Rob Portman’s prolonged and varied use of Google’s tools, while typical among corporate clients, is rare in politics, said a Google official. Much of the work of U.S. Sen. Rob Portman’s re-election campaign in Ohio is happening under the fingertips of voters. Google says Portman has made some of the savviest use this election cycle of its digital resources as his campaign has begun to unravel an early lead by former Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland. Through his well-funded campaign, Portman is effectively using data mining, YouTube ads and search promotion in his race against Strickland, a Democrat, said Lee Dunn, head of the tech giant’s elections-industry operation in Washington, D.C. Most political campaigns use Google. In fact, Strickland’s Senate campaign also has employed the company’s search lifts and data mining tools and even helped test non-skippable, six-second “bumper ads” on YouTube last spring. But Dunn said the Republican’s prolonged and varied use of Google’s tools, while typical among corporate clients, is rare in politics. “I would say Fortune 500 companies always seem to be a little bit farther ahead than politicians, as you can imagine,” she said. “Candidates are relearning these tools every four or five years, and Fortune 500 companies are learning every day how to utilize the latest available technology.” Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona has also notably used Google tools for a Spanish-language campaign, and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders’ presidential campaign made extensive use of Google to turn out voters and to issue blasts to his supporters’ mobile devices. David Niven, an assistant professor of political science at the University of Cincinnati, said Portman has had the advantage of deep campaign reserves accumulated as Republicans seek to hold onto what was viewed initially as one of the country’s most vulnerable Senate seats. “He jumped on digital even six years ago, because he knew he would have the resources for a full-throated campaign, and it’s increasingly hard to find the voters watching TV when you’d like them to be,” Niven said. “Both sides looked at Ohio as a proving ground and perhaps the Republicans somewhat more desperately, thinking if they can’t save Ohio they can’t possibly hold the Senate." Niven said TV viewers, especially those in Ohio who see an onslaught of television ads each election year, have become savvy at tuning out TV spots by leaving the room, muting the volume or surfing their phones during commercials. Internet techniques are more difficult to avoid. Portman’s campaign, for instance, has created different audiences around the state, delivering each a different online message. Search tools from Google elevate Portman’s website, and sites negative toward Strickland, in web searches — and data mining allows ineffective ad message to be quickly pulled and replaced. “We met with Google’s analysts and political team in January 2015 and committed to run a data-driven, tech-savvy campaign that would involve Google analysts in everything we do,” said Portman campaign manager Corry Bliss. “Working with the Google team has allowed us to run and target multiple messages at any given time across Ohio and contrast Rob’s accomplishments for Ohio families with Ted Strickland’s failures as governor.” The Strickland campaign said it also is heavily using the most innovative digital advertising strategies. “We use digital micro targeting in conjunction with our data and analytics to ensure we’re reaching the right voters with the most persuasive argument, and we’re communicating with voters who may not be watching television by placing content on websites like Pandora,” spokesman David Bergstein said. “If Senator Portman thinks Google can help him win, he obviously hasn’t Googled his own record.” Favorite Print Story Advertisement • Place an ad News Video More Videos Advertisement • Place an ad Explore Columbus Search Businesses Featured Businesses Loading...

Jason Cipriani/CNET The internet really, really wants you to register to vote 0 Share: Tech Culture by Alfred Ng September 27, 2016 11:47 AM PDT @alfredwkng Up Next President Obama slams fake news for eroding democracy On the top websites in the US, you'll see the same theme. Internet titans Google, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and Reddit are banding together to get out the vote this November. With tens of millions of views every day, these five sites -- along with up to 4,000 other organizations -- will be urging Americans to register to vote. The effort comes a day after Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton sparred in their first presidential debate. Google got a head start on the National Voter Registration Day internet blitz. Its Doodle on Monday showed users a simple and effective tool for getting registered. The movement started after 2008, when 6 million people couldn't vote because they were unaware of how to register, according to Matt Singer. He's the founder of National Voter Registration Day, which takes place the fourth Tuesday of September, and a proponent of a widespread web presence. Enlarge Image On September 26, Google used its Doodle to push for voter registration. Photo by Google "We want everyone to celebrate," Singer said in an interview. "A lot of web platforms are known for having a young audience, like Tumblr, but ... I think everyone in America uses Google." Tumblr joined the push with a link directly to a voter registration page featured on the right side of its dashboard. Silicon Alley companies like AOL, Bitly, Foursquare and Kickstarter banded together through the hashtag #TechTurnsOut, reaching out in real life to New Yorkers in a concerted effort to increase voter registration. Apps like DoorDash also joined in the effort, by delivering voter registration information straight to users' doorsteps, when it usually delivers meals. The delivery app is available in San Francisco, New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and Denver. Based in Washington, DC, Phone2Action rolled out its Civic Action Center tool, that lets users check their voter registration status, register to vote, vote early and find polling sites. Enlarge Image Facebook gets in on the voter registration action. Photo by Screenshot by Laura Martínez/CNET It's a rare occasion when a number of the country's top websites are singing in harmony. In 2012, Google, Wikipedia, Reddit and other pages "blacked out" in a protest against the Stop Online Piracy Act. Here's how the internet is banding together to help get out the vote: Google: Google's registration tool includes options for registration and deadlines on when to get that done, based on your state. This year, for the first time, the search engine giant added voter registration information in Spanish. Facebook: The social network's millions of active US users have already seen a post pinned to the top of their feeds encouraging users to register to vote. The push rolled out September 23, showing users above the age of 18 how to register, along with all their friends who have already registered. YouTube: The video giant has campaigned heavily for its users to register to vote, using the hashtag #voteIRL. It has teamed up with channels like the Young Turks and The Fung Bros to get its viewers to vote and has been pushing videos that are one minute and 34 seconds -- the average time it takes to register to vote. It also tweaked its logo to include the hashtag. Twitter: Users on Twitter will be able to join in the conversation and tell their friends and followers #iRegistered with the social network's official hashtag. The post comes with a custom emoji showing an American flag top hat with 2016 under it. Twitter is also hosting a kick-off event in Washington, DC, at 8:30 a.m. ET, with its vice president of public policy and philanthropy, Colin Crowell. #NationalVoterRegistrationDay is also trending on Twitter. Reddit: The politics subreddit of the "Front Page of the Internet" is hosting an Ask Me Anything on how to register to vote as well as issues that young people are concerned about. The subreddit is teaming up with Rock the Vote for its step-by-step guide. Snapchat: The voter registration app TurboVote is teaming up with Snapchat on Stories and Discover pages to help users get with the vote. Celebrities like Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson and Jimmy Fallon will be featured on Snapchat's stories to help users learn how to register to vote. Pandora: The internet radio site has partnered up with HeadCount, encouraging listeners to register to vote off its mobile platform with messages from artists like The National and Dispatch. The call to action points out that users can register to vote in less than a minute -- before their songs are even finished. Updated at 10:19 a.m. and 11:47 a.m. PT: Includes more details on organizations participating in National Voter Registration Day.

(AAPL) Amazon Echo is huge, Google Home is about to take it on, so where is AAPL’s Siri-powered speaker?

(AAPL) Angers New MacBook Pro Fans Yet Again Apple Inc. (AAPL) Could Launch Apple Glasses by 2018 View All Posts Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has had the opportunity to build a big lead in the smart home thanks to its stealthy approach of hiding Alexa in its Amazon Echo wireless speaker. With Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) on the verge of launching its own Google Home version, it appears Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) will also soon join the fray. Source: Beni Krausz via Unsplash Reports have a Siri-powered prototype now in testing, and a mystery wireless device just hit the FCC for approval. Amazon Echo Is Stealing the Home Consumer technology giants like Apple, Google and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) had been seen as having a leg up on Amazon when it comes to the smart home. Their personal assistants — Siri, Google Now and Cortana — are integrated into their smartphones, tablets and PCs. That means a huge, mobile user base. Amazon has Alexa, but with no smartphone presence, its impact was limited. With the next big tech battle shaping up to be the fight to be at the center of the smart home — the hub that controls all those connected devices — Amazon was at a big disadvantage. Then it came up with the idea for the Amazon Echo. Has Apple Inc.’s iPhone 7 Lost Its Shine in Just a Week (AAPL)? The company integrated its Alexa personal assistant within a connected speaker equipped with an array of microphones. The Amazon Echo turned into an unlikely hit with consumers. Besides listening to and controlling streaming music, they can order products from Amazon, check the weather and they can control a large and growing array of smart home devices and appliances. All by voice, all without having to lift up a smartphone. And it’s not limited to the living room. Amazon Echo Success Draw Attention The success of the Amazon Echo caught everyone off guard. Early in September, AMZN announced Alexa had passed the 3,000 “Skills” milestone. That means 3,000 services or products that can be controlled using the Echo. That’s not just a big number — it’s big growth. The figure was tripled in three months and includes partnerships with a growing number of well-known companies. With its stealth approach, Amazon was suddenly in the driver’s seat in the race to be at the center of the connected home. Alphabet was the first to announce it was fighting back, with Google Home. Also a connected, voice-activated speaker. Waiting for Apple to Enter the Fray Apple has been mum on its plans. However, the rumor mill says AAPL is hard at work on its answer to Amazon. The latest is a report from Bloomberg that says a Siri-powered device designed to be Apple’s voice-activated smart home hub is now in the prototype testing phase. Adding fuel to the fire, MacRumors picked up on a submission by Apple to the FCC for approval of a mystery device. The wireless device carries identification numbers that don’t correspond to any current Apple products. Accompanying technical drawings hint at something with rounded edges that appears to be smaller than the Apple TV. Could it be the Amazon Echo competitor? Naturally, with Apple being Apple — that is to say, extremely secretive — we won’t know for certain if it’s working on an Amazon Echo competitor until the day it’s officially announced. It seems likely, though. Amazon is building up a big lead. It’s expanding the Echo product line with smaller and less expensive versions in an attempt to broaden its appeal, even as a growing parade of partners signs on. Alphabet is about to join the battle, just in time for the holiday shopping season. Siri is a successful and well-known voice assistant. The Apple TV is in millions of living rooms. The iPhone is the most popular smartphone in the U.S., Apple Music is one of the top music streaming services. Apple owns Beats (one of the best-known names in personal audio). HomeKit has been integrating smart device controls with iOS for several years. Apple Inc. (AAPL) Is Trying to Crack a Serious iOS 10 Security Issue Apple has all the pieces to build a killer, voice-activated speaker. With the success of the Amazon Echo and looming arrival of Alphabet, it has the motivation to do so. The only question is when. As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Google Trends says more people looked up Clinton's name than Republican Donald Trump's in all 50 states following Monday's debate. Google says Trump searches led in the majority of states before the debate. The search giant says users looked up information on both candidates' stances on immigration, abortion and guns most often while the debate was happening. Many used Google to do their own fact-checking on the candidates' claims. Google says the top fact check question for Trump revolved around his stance on the Iraq war. For Clinton, users wanted to follow up on her statement that stop-and-frisk police tactics had been ruled unconstitutional. Meanwhile, Trump says he didn't have the sniffles during the debate. The Republican presidential nominee sounded like he was sniffling - and loudly - through much of the presidential debate Monday, eliciting comments and jokes on social media. The hashtag #sniffle became popular on Twitter. But asked about that in a phone interview on Tuesday morning on Fox & Friends, Trump denied there was any sniffling. He said the microphone was very bad, "but maybe it was good enough to hear breathing. But there was no sniffles". Trump also floated the theory that debate moderators gave him a bad microphone on purpose.
