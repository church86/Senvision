Why Are You Still Reading This Title? Ok, Google. Tell me a joke. Ok, Google. Tell me a joke. Ok, Goog--you get it. by Jessica Lachenal | 8:25 am, November 9th, 2016   I know we keep harping on the same opening, but I truly believe that we do need a laugh or two after that election. Or, as David Chen would have it, fifteen minutes of straight jokes. To test his brand new Google Home device, he asked it to tell him jokes for fifteen minutes straight. This is some extreme edge case QA testing, I have to say, and Chen’s findings are, well… kind of funny. You can see for yourself in the video above, which chronicles his entire endurance test. Oh, and its accompanied by a wonderful view of the Seattle sky and the Space Needle. About halfway through the video, Google Home starts to repeat jokes, as if it’s come to the bottom of its list and it’s starting to really rake in the boos at the Laugh Factory. After a little while longer, it takes longer to pull up a joke. Then, eventually, it crashes, likely deciding that giving up and beginning again is a lot less painful than having to tell the same knock-knock joke yet again. If you’ve got one of these–or if you have any voice command-enabled phone–you should try this out yourself and see what happens. I wonder what Siri would do if it were offered its own Comedy Central special. (via Laughing Squid) Want more stories like this?

Great value,Decent screen,Slick interface PROS: Great value,Decent screen,Slick interface Poor camera,Low internal storage,Extra cost for microSD and 4G CONS: Poor camera,Low internal storage,Extra cost for microSD and 4G Continue reading Update: Time has passed, and Moto's latest line of budget-friendly phones is full of better options than the Moto G (2013).  If you're interested in a good all-around smartphone that won't cost a whole lot, check out the Moto G4.    The Moto G4 Plus amps up the performance and adds a fingerprint sensor to the formula for just a little more cash.    Lastly, the Moto G4 Play retains the essentials in the G4 formula, but slashes the price nearly in half. Sure, it isn't as fast or feature-filled as the G4 or G4 Plus, but it's still a heck of a deal.    The best part about the newer devices is that Android Nougat will be available soon. So, the amount of valid reasons to consider an older Moto G, like this phone, are dwindling quickly.  Original review follows below. Motorola kicked off its global smartphone revival with the keenly priced Moto G handset, which was quickly followed by the 4G enabled Moto G 4G. Both have since been replaced by the larger, 5-inch Moto G (2014) edition, although it will set you back a little more and the bigger screen may not suit everyone's tastes. The first generation Moto G is a mid-range handset with a low-end price tag and Android Lollipop (at least on the 3G version)- enough to pique the interest of many savvy shoppers.. First things first then, the Motorola Moto G price. You can pick the 3G handset up in two storage sizes - 8GB and 16GB. The former will now set you back around £100/$140, while the larger size is still very palatable at around £120/$170. Motorola has enhanced the handset with the new Moto G 4G iteration, which is ever so slightly pricier coming in at around £110 - but does also pack in a microSD slot for some lovely storage expansion. That price is for the 8GB model, as the Moto G 4G doesn't have a 16GB variant. It's difficult to find a first generation Moto G on general sale now though, especially the 3G variant, with most retailers now stocking the newer second gen, 2014 version. So where does this place the Moto G in the market? Well at that price it has the likes of the Sony Xperia M2, Microsoft Lumia 640 and HTC Desire 510 for company and in terms of specs it easily stands up to them. In terms of design both the Moto G and Moto G 4G take most of their cues from the firm's first, post-Google takeover handset, the Moto X. It's hardly groundbreaking in terms of looks, but the soft, curved edges of the Moto G make it relatively attractive and the swath of plastic feels solid and well built. Weighing in at 143g the Moto G has a pleasing, well balanced presence in the hand without being overbearing, and while it may measure 11.6mm thick in the middle the tapered edges make it feel thinner than it is. Couple that with a rubberised rear plate which slightly hugs the side of the handset too, and the Motorola Moto G fits comfortably in the palm, providing a decent level of grip. The Moto G features a water repellent coating which means you'll be able to whip it out in the rain without fear of a short circuit, but it is not waterproof - so no jumping in the bath with it. You can even take the rear cover off and swap it for a different color, which Motorola is pushing as a big customizable feature of the phone. In reality however it just reminds me of my Nokia 3310. Sure, changing covers is fun for all of five minutes, but the novelty soon wears off. Not to mention the back cover is also pretty tricky to remove - you need to really dig your nails in at the base of the handset to get it free. In fact, so much strength needs to be employed to free the cover from the Moto G I feared on more than one occasion that the thin plastic would snap - thankfully it never did. Motorola did make a point that the younger generation like the ability to "customize" their handsets and this particular feature, along with the rock bottom price, reinforces the Moto G's credentials as a handset which may land in the laps of many teenagers. Something worth noting is that because the Moto G and Moto G 4G are identical is design and size you can switch covers between the two variants. The left side of the Motorola Moto G is devoid of any features, while the top of the handset only sports a centralized headphone jack. Both the power/lock key and volume rocker switch are located on the right of the G and these are easy to reach and responsive to the press. On the base is a microUSB port, while under the removable cover the only physical difference between the Moto G 4G and Moto G can be found. Open up the 3G enabled Moto G and you'll spy a microSIM port on the side towards the top of the handset- but no microSD slot. Now take a look at the Moto G 4G, and the microSIM port has changed to a microSD slot, with the new SIM location in the bottom corner of the handset. The 2070mAh non-removable battery housed inside the Moto G is claimed to give you all day battery life, and I put that to the test - skip ahead to the battery life and connectivity section to see how it got on. The Moto G comes with a 4.5-inch, 1280 x 720 display and boasts a 329ppi pixel density. To put that in some perspective that's a bigger, higher resolution and more defined display than the iPhone 5S - not bad for a handset which is a third of the price. Of course a HD display isn't the only key factor in a smartphone, but Motorola has managed to equip the Moto G 4G and G with a 1.2GHz quad-core Snapdragon 400 processor and 1GB of RAM. In terms of specs then the Motorola Moto G is actually giving the HTC One Mini, Samsung Galaxy S4 Mini and Nokia Lumia 820 a run for their mid-range, dual-core money - and once again the screen is bigger than these rivals. The Motorola handset even beats the Samsung and Nokia when it comes to resolution. The camera on the rear of the Moto G is only 5MP and this is trumped by the S4 Mini and Lumia 820 and their 8MP snappers. All in all the Moto G finds itself in no-mans land, with a complete disconnect between its price and spec list. This, of course, isn't a bad thing and on paper it offers outstanding value for money. The proof however, is in the pudding, so let's see how the Motorola Moto G got on in real life. The Motorola Moto G was one of the first handsets to be updated to Android 4.4.2 KitKat and since then the 3G version of the phone has had a fairly speedy upgrade to Android 5.0 Lollipop - thanks to the manufacturer's close ties with the search giant. The 4G model is still to be updated, but Motorola has revealed that for this model it will be skipping Android 5.0 and jumping straight to Android 5.1. With a 1.2GHz quad-core processor and 1GB of RAM at its heart, the Moto G is more than well equipped enough to run Lollipop which is the smoothest version of Android to date, but if you're on the 4G version running Android KitKat you can expect smooth performance too. Android purists will be pleased to learn that the Moto G and Moto G 4G are running the stock version of Android, with Motorola opting against applying an overlay - claiming instead that it's focused on things which add real benefit to users. These "benefits" include a faster boot up time and improved audio, data management, web speeds and general navigation. I found that the Moto G did boot up impressively quickly, but Motorola's claims that it performs various tasks quicker than the Samsung Galaxy S4 still seem a little far fetched to me. Sure the interface is smooth - impressively so in fact when you consider the price - but I can't say that it noticeably out performs, or even matches the various flagships I've had the pleasure of using. General operation under KitKat is fluid and while it may not be as lightening quick as the top end handsets, the quad-core chip is doing a good job under the hood and I had no issues with lag. You get five homescreens - no more, no less (there's no way to add or remove) - and the familiar Android set up with a selection of widgets available in the tabbed app drawer for you to choose from. Drag and drop an app onto another on any homescreen and the Motorola Moto G will automatically create a folder with both applications inside, allowing you to easily organize and manage your favorite apps. The pull down notification bar at the top of the Moto G's display offers up a feast of information from recent calls, new emails and text messages to Google Now prompts, app updates and third party notifications. Glide a finger over certain notifications, such as a new email alert, and it will expand allowing you to see a longer overview of the message. Slide you finger up from the home key at the base of the screen and you'll launch Google Now, Android's own digital personal assistant and Siri rival. Google Now offers up relevant information in a series of cards, and by tracking your movement, messages and emails it can tailor these cards to suit your needs. You can get information such as the weather, meeting reminders and details on the journey home here. It's still relatively hit and miss and there are far fewer features enabled for those outside of the US, but Google is constantly working on Now and it's slowly becoming more relevant. Tap the multi-tasking key in the bottom navigation bar and you'll be greeted with the familiar stack of thumbnails showing the apps which are currently running. This is testament to the quad-core processor inside the Moto G and Moto G 4G, as the handset can comfortably handle multiple apps at the same time and you're able to switch between them very quickly. Basic applications opened promptly, but I did notice some lag with some of the more demanding games, such as Stick Cricket and Stick Tennis. When these were tapped the Motorola Moto G took a couple of seconds to load up the application. It's not a huge issue and game play is still smooth once you're past the initial load, but it just hints at a potentially small flaw in the low 1.2GHz clock speed of the quad-core chip. The interface is slightly different on the Lollipop-toting 3G handset, with Material Design giving it a new look and fluid animations, as well as improvements to the notifications system, which now prioritises them and places them on the lock screen. The multi-tasking screen has a new look too and there are various other small but handy tweaks and features, like a flashlight option in quick settings. Everything looks bright, crisp and clear on the 4.5-inch display and while the Moto G doesn't match up to the full HD offerings you get on the flagship phones, for a handset with such a low price you'll be more than happy and it puts the competition to shame. There's a thin bezel down each side of the screen, but it's not the slimmest I've seen and I reckon Motorola is pushing its luck a little calling it an "edge-to-edge display." Sure it doesn't feel like there's any unnecessary plastic padding around the screen, but it's not as close cut as on other handsets - the LG G4 springs to mind immediately as a handset with a slimmer bezel. The screen is also very responsive to the touch which makes moving around the Moto G and Moto G 4G a stress-free experience. Contacts As I've mentioned the Motorola Moto G is running stock Android, so there are no surprises in the People app. Contacts are displayed in the standard, alphabetical list format with pictures of your chums to the left - that is if the Moto G can pull them through from your Google contacts and their Google+ pages. A lot of my contacts ended up faceless for the simple fact that they aren't on Google+ and there's no way of linking your buddies up with their Facebook or Twitter profiles - Whatsapp integration is available however. Why? Well it's because Google had a bit of a falling out with some of the main social media players and the join contact integration we see on the likes of Samsung, HTC and even Huawei devices are all the doing of the manufacturers themselves tinkering with the OS. It's not a huge issue, it just means your contact list doesn't look quite as pretty, but it's something I feel Motorola could have included as part of its added benefits for the user - never mind, you can't win them all. What all this means is that your contact cards a relatively bland - there's all the vital information - numbers, emails and the sort - but don't expect any thrills. It's cheap, cheerful and user friendly. As well as your main contact list the People app offers two further tabs at the top of the screen - groups and favorites. Nothing out of the ordinary here, but it makes it easier to find the people you contact most often. Adding a new contact is easy - just tap the central icon in the bar below your contact list and you'll be transported to the data entry screen where you can fill in all manner of details about your new found friend. Calling The Phone app is where you'll be heading if you need to make a call, and as default you'll find it in the app dock on the homescreen of the Motorola Moto G - although you can move it out of here if you prefer. Fire it up and you'll be taken to the phone overview tab which was a new feature in Android KitKat. Here you'll see your more recent calls, most called contacts and your stared buddies for easy call-back ability. Hit the dial pad icon at the base of the screen, start tapping out a number and you'll notice that smart dialing is enabled, with the Moto G offering up various contact suggestions relating to the numbers you've entered. If you want to call someone you've spoken to recently tap the clock icon at the top of the screen and you'll get to the call list. Press the phone icon to the right of a contact and the Moto G will start calling them. Call quality is acceptable, although it was far from crystal clear and the Moto G could do with the addition of HD voice to improve the clarity of voice chat. That said I was still able to hear and understand the person on the other end of the line, and vice versa, so for a budget handset the Moto G and Moto G 4G don't perform badly. I found the Moto G and Moto G 4G was able to keep hold of signal well, even in areas of poor reception and I didn't witness any dropped calls during the review period. The Motorola Moto G and Moto G 4G offer up the usual array of messaging capabilities, but thanks to the inclusion of Android Lollipop/Android 4.4.2 (and Android 4.3 before them) you get not one, but two text messaging clients. There's the stock Messaging application which will be familiar to anyone who has used an Android phone in the past. It's a minimalist, intuitive interface with a list of all your message streams and options at the base of the display to create a new SMS, search your current messages and a basic menu. Profile pictures are pulled through from contact cards which makes the app look a little better - although the lack of Facebook and Twitter integration means you'll still end up with a lot of blank tiles. This is all very well and good, but Google is looking consolidate messaging apps by bringing together SMS and what was known as Google Talk into the Hangouts application. In terms of text messages Hangouts works in a very similar way to the standard Messaging app, albeit with a slightly different look. But mixed up in your text messages are also instant messaging streams, allowing you to talk to more people from a single app. Talking of things coming in twos, you're also treated to two email clients on the Moto G and Moto G 4G, with the Gmail app living alongside the standard Email offering. If you only deal with Google's email setup then you can completely disregard the stock Email app and focus all your efforts on the intuitive Gmail client. From here you can manage multiple Googlemail accounts, with an attractive and colorful interface making it a seamless and pleasing experience. Those of you with other accounts outside of the search giant's remit will have to go to the stock Email app where you'll be able to sign in to all manner of addresses - you can even stick your Gmail accounts in here. There's a unified inbox on offer, allowing you to see all your messages in one place, but you can also filter by account if things start to get a little confusing. HTML emails load in a fully zoomed out view in both apps, allowing you to easily navigate to the area you want without a lot of frantic scrolling. The Moto G and Moto G 4G look set up for the younger generation with a low price and interchangeable covers, so I was a little puzzled when I found Motorola hadn't pre-installed the likes of Facebook and Twitter. It's not a huge issue, as a quick trip to Google Play quickly resolves this, but it is a little frustrating. Although with Google breathing down its neck, perhaps these pre-installs were out of the question for the Moto G and Moto G 4G. In terms of an input method you get the stock Android keyboard, which is a serviceable offering with word prediction and auto-correct, although I'd still recommend downloading a third party option such as SwiftKey if you're planning on doing a lot of typing. The responsive 4.5-inch touchscreen aids typing speed, and provides enough space to ensure the keys are not cramped. Rotating the Motorola Moto G 90 degrees will see the keyboard adjust to the landscape view, giving you larger keys. Chrome is the default browser on the Motorola Moto G, which isn't a huge surprise, and I found that on a strong Wi-Fi connection web pages loaded up in good time. The desktop version of TechRadar managed to render in an impressive five seconds, while the mobile site took just a couple of seconds. There's no 4G connectivity on standard Moto G, so you'll have to settle for 3G data speeds unless you're willing to splash the extra cash on the Moto G 4G. Even over 3G though it was able to load mobile sites in around three seconds, while desktop offerings took less than 10. Moto G 4G performance was more in line with the Wi-Fi speeds. The Moto G comfortably outperforms its price bracket when it comes to surfing the web, and the 4.5-inch display means there's plenty of space to play with. Text is crisp and clear and images are well defined on the 1280 x 720 display, which gives the impression you're using a smartphone which is twice the price of the Moto G. Double tapping on a paragraph of text will see the Moto G zoom in to fit the width of the text to the screen, and thanks to the 4.5-inch display you can read it relatively easily. If you find that the text is still a little small you can zoom in further, but there's no auto text reflow available, which means you'll be scrolling sideways as well as down. Sadly there's no reader mode on offer here and that's probably the one negative mark against Chrome, as along with the lack of text reflow it makes reading long articles a little frustrating. Chrome supports tabbed browsing and you can view the number of open tabs at the top of the page next to the URL bar and quickly jump between them by tapping the icon. This gives you a thumbnail view of each tab, displayed in a series of scrollable cards. The Moto G has no trouble running multiple tabs at the same time. You can also open up incognito tabs which don't track your surfing history, meaning you can visits all those special sites without a trail for your partner to find at a later date. A handy feature within Chrome is the ability to sign into your Google account and have all your bookmarks, and even opened tabs, pulled through from your desktop and vice versa. Bookmarks can be accessed from the Chrome menu and appear as app icons on the screen for easy perusal. While many of the specs on the Moto G and Moto G 4G have exceeded its price, the camera is an area where Motorola has clearly tried to save some money. On the rear of the handset you'll find a 5MP camera and single LED flash, while on the front you get a 1.3MP snapper. Motorola has done some work in the camera app on the Moto G, providing a minimalist interface which sees all the settings hidden from view and the whole screen made into a shutter key. Now I've bemoaned the use of the whole screen as the shutter on other handsets, as the fiddly little app icons could be easily missed, leading to me taking many unwanted snaps. Luckily this issue has been overcome on the Motorola Moto G, as the settings wheel is accessed by sliding your finger from left to right over the display - not once did I accidentally take a picture when trying to tweak options. That might be partly due to the fact I rarely found myself accessing settings, because it's seriously slim pickings. For anyone looking to tinker with various modes, effects and advanced settings such as brightness and white balance the Moto G / Moto G 4G is not the cameraphone for you. All you get are flash, HDR mode, shutter sound and aspect ratio toggles along with a Panorama mode, the ability to attach location information to your snaps and a rudimentary focus & exposure control. If you have plumped for the Motorola Moto G 4G you do get an additional option in the menu wheel, allowing you to save snaps to the microSD card (if you have one inserted) rather than to the internal storage. Shutter speed is pretty swift, but if you fancy a burst mode just hold down on the screen and the Moto G will snap away until you release your finger. There's a 4x digital zoom to boot which is controlled by sliding your finger up and down the display - although picture quality takes a serious battering, so it's best avoided. The full screen trigger makes snapping photos easy as you don't have to aim for a small shutter button on screen, although once you see the results you may wish you never bothered. That budget price tag really rings true here, and I found the majority of my photos were a pixelated mess. The Motorola Moto G struggled to focus properly and even with the focus & exposure setting turned on things didn't improve. The Moto G performed better close up, as it was obvious what to focus on - but when looking at landscapes and situations with a lot going on it just couldn't make up its mind. It's a real shame that the Moto G doesn't have even a slightly better camera offering, but at its rock bottom price point a concession had to be made somewhere, and this is it.

And so they should be, as that 5MP sensor is also responsible for the 720p video capture on the Moto G. Options were sparse for the camera function, and there's even less choice on offer when it comes to video recording. Hit the video recorder icon in the camera app and the Moto G will start recording straight away - no change of mode and no new wheel of settings, just straight into the action. That's great if you're in a hurry to start recording, but it also means you get the same limited settings wheel as the camera app, with some of the features obviously not compatible with the video recorder. One option which is dedicated to filming is slow motion capture, allowing you to add a rather simple, yet pleasing effect to your videos. It's not as impressive as the implementation on the iPhone 6 or even the iPhone 5S, but nether the less it's a nice feature to have. Resulting footage is acceptable when played back on the Moto G's 4.5-inch display, but it doesn't look great when moved to a larger screen such as a computer or TV. While the Moto G disappoints with no expandable memory option allowing you to build on the internal 8GB/16GB of storage, the Motorola Moto G 4G does sport a microSD slot - although it does cost slightly more. If you have the 3G model and want to expand the onboard storage you'll have to take to the cloud. Thankfully Motorola has struck a deal with Google to offer Moto G users an additional 50GB of Google Drive storage on top of the 15GB already provided. If I've done my maths correctly that means you'll get 65GB of cloud storage for free if you pick up a Motorola Moto G, although the additional 50GB is only free for the first two years. It's worth noting that the limited internal storage will fill up fast if you stick lots of videos and music tracks on the Moto G. In fact 2.5GB of storage is taken up by the Android operating system, so if you end up plumping for the 8GB Moto G (or the Moto G 4G which only comes in 8GB) you'll only get 5.5GB of physical storage - that's not great. Music There's just one music app on the Moto G, Google's Play Music offering which fuses your own personal library with the search giant's All Access streaming service. You can get a 30 day free trail of All Access which has millions of songs and radio stations, but once that trail is up it'll cost you £9.99, $9.99, AU$11.99 per month to continue listening. If you're already signed up to another streaming service, such as Spotify, you don't need to bother with All Access, but if you're new to the game then you might want to check it out. For those of you who already have a huge music collection Google will let you upload 50,000 of your tracks to its Play Music cloud service for free, giving you access to all your songs on any Android device. Of course you can always dig out the trusty USB cable and transfer your tracks over the old fashioned way - either way they'll appear in the "My Library" section of the Play Music app. You can browse your songs by title, album, artist and genre with album art pulled through to make things look a little nicer. Tap a song to starting playing it and it will appear in a bar at the bottom of the screen, allowing you to continue browsing your collection. Hit that bar and you'll be taken to the now playing screen where you'll find the usual play/pause, skip and scrub controls along with shuffle and repeat. Sound quality is more than acceptable through a half decent set of headphones, although the built in speaker isn't exactly great with tinny, distorted sound the order of the day - in short, best avoided. FM radio The Moto G comes equipped with a FM radio, which Motorola claims was included to give people free access to music if they didn't fancy signing up to costly streaming services. You'll need to have the headphones plugged in to get reception, and ideally you need to be outside as indoor reception was generally pretty poor. The app is at least easy to use, with the Moto G and Moto G 4G automatically scanning the radio waves for available stations, and you can favorite the ones you listen to the most for easy access. Video There's no dedicated video player app on the Moto G, so if you've transferred your own videos onto the handset, or fancy playing pack something you recorded with the phone you'll need to head to the Gallery. Video clips which you've transferred onto the Moto G / Moto G 4G will reside in a separate folder to your images, but anything you've filmed through the 5MP camera will be bunged into the camera roll, which can make clips a little tricky to find. Tap a video and it will open in a very basic video player - you can play/pause by tapping the middle of the screen and skip through using the scrub bar. That's your lot though. Playback itself is very good thanks to the decently sized 4.5-inch display and the 1280 x 720 resolution and once again its an area where the Moto G can comfortably compete with the likes of the One Mini and Galaxy S4 Mini. The Moto G is comfortable to hold for long periods of time, and it's not too heavy. I would recommend listening to your videos via headphones though, as the speaker on the rear isn't up to much. Google's Play Movies & TV app also resides on the Moto G and if you've purchased films or TV shows from Google Play you'll be able to access them from here. Once again the video player screen is very basic with the same controls as found in the gallery, but at least it's a simple, intuitive app. You can buy or rent movies from Google Play and there's a direct link to the store from the Movies & TV app. Photos Head on over to the Gallery on the Moto G or Moto G 4G to view all your snaps and other images downloaded from the likes of Whatsapp or received via Bluetooth. It's very much standard Android fare here, with the usual thumbnail galleries allowing you to get a good overview of all your snaps. Tap a photo and then select the pencil icon in the bottom corner and you'll be transported into the well stocked photo editor housed with the Moto G. From here you can apply various effects, exposure settings and frames to your snaps as well as crop, rotate, mirror and even straighten any wonky efforts. It's simple to use and there's a decent range of options for you to chose from, although the poor performance of that 5MP camera may be a step too far for this editor. Battery life Motorola claims that the 2070mAh non-removable battery inside the Moto G and Moto G 4G will give you all day battery life, and while I found it's unlikely to see out 24 hours, it's just about able to see through the day. I managed to get a full days use from the Moto G (7am-11pm) and by the time I got into bed the battery meter in the notification bar was red and the handset was in need of an overnight charge. The Moto G had been used pretty heavily, with a couple of hours of music streaming, web surfing, constantly updating email inboxes, some social media activity and a few hours of pretty intense gaming. With more reserved usage the Moto G will comfortably make it to bedtime, last overnight and give you a few hours use in the morning (if you're lucky). If you're planning on staying overnight somewhere you'll still need to take your charger with you to be safe. It's worth keeping an eye on screen brightness, especially when you're watching movies on the Moto G as it can drain the battery somewhat. The good news is there isn't any real difference in battery life performance between the Moto G and Moto G 4G - and I had a Jawbone Up24 and LG G Watch connected to the latter during most of the review period. During the battery test I played a 90 minute Nyan Gareth video on full brightness with all accounts syncing in the background and the 3G enabled Moto G lost 33% of life from a full charge. That's not a terrible result, but if you're planning a bit of a movie marathon you'll want to make sure you're within reach of a charger. If you find yourself getting close to the limit but are nowhere near a charger you can always enable the battery saver which restricts background data activity in an attempt to eek out more life. Connectivity The Moto G comes with all the standard connectivity options you'd expect from a low-end smartphone - Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS and 3G are all on board. Of course if you go for the Moto G 4G you also get LTE connectivity, plus a handy microSD slot. Pull down the notification bar on the Moto G, tap the icon in the top corner and you'll get a selection of quick settings allowing you to toggle Wi-Fi and Bluetooth quickly. For the other options you'll need to head into the settings menu, where you'll also find the wireless hotspot function. This lets you share your phone's data connection with other devices, such as tablets and laptops. Keep an eye on your data usage though, as this can munch through it in next to no time and you don't want to be lumped with a huge bill. The standard Moto G doesn't have a microSD slot, so more of an importance is placed on the microUSB port on the base of the device as you'll need to plug the Moto G into a computer to transfer over multiple files. NFC is missing from both the Moto G 4G and G, but this is less of an issue as the contactless tech is still yet to take off in a big way. Maps The Moto G and Moto G 4G comes equipped with Google Maps, which has been heavily documented many times before so I'll keep this brief. I tend to find that low-end handsets struggle with the power hungry Maps app, with sluggish load times and fragmented user experience - things are different on the Moto G though. Maps loaded almost instantly, even over 3G, and the Moto G was usually able to pinpoint my location in under a second. The speed was even better on the Moto G 4G with the superfast LTE connection. Zooming and panning around the map is smooth, while the ability to plan routes and start up the free turn by turn navigation makes the Moto G one of the most affordable sat navs on the market. You do need a data connection for navigation to work though, so if you're planning some rural routes it may not be able to direct you if signal drops. Apps Apart from the stock Google applications Motorola has added very little in terms of additional pre-installs, which isn't a bad thing as the swath of bloatware you get on some smartphones (I'm looking at you Samsung) can be overbearing. You can quickly build up a decent app collection on your Moto G thanks to the well stocked Google Play store which offers up a huge range of free and paid-for apps and games as well as movies, music, books and magazines. There are a handful of Motorola's own apps on the Moto G and Moto G 4G, the first of which being Assist. With Assist you can automatically have the Moto G switch itself to silent between certain hours at night so your sleep is not disturbed. Motorola Assist can also go through your calendar appointments and automatically mute itself when you're in meetings - perfect if you have a really embarrassing ringtone. You can select predetermined exceptions, so if someone was to ring you twice with five minutes Assist would allow your Moto G to ring, as the call could well be something very important - or your friend could just be very drunk and feels compelled to tell you that they love you at 4am. While Assist is a nice idea it is rather limited, as Meeting and Sleeping are the only two options, with each offering a limited number of customisable options. I'd have liked to see an option to create your own scenarios and a wealth of exceptions and rules that could be applied - for example a location tracker which knows when you've got to work so automatically turns the Moto G to vibrate and turns on Wi-Fi. Motorola Migrate is the next app in the line up, which aims to make it really easy for you to transfer content from your old phone to your shiny new Moto G or Moto G 4G. You'll need to download the Motorola Migrate app on your old Android handset too, and there's currently no support here for Windows Phone 8, BlackBerry 10 (or BB OS7) or iOS 8. In terms of what Migrate can pull across from your old phone it'll take care of text messages, call history, SIM contacts, media, volume settings and screen brightness. Sure it's a nifty little app and the easy to follow wizard will mean even rookie Android users will be able to follow it - it's just a shame about the limited platform support. Finally there's the Moto Care app, giving you a troubleshooting port of call if your Moto G isn't behaving itself, or you can't work out how to do something. You can search the various help topics, tutorials and FAQs to find your answer, but if that doesn't help there's also the option to start a live chat with a support representative - plus there's an option to call someone too. There's an awful lot to compare the Motorola Moto G and Moto G 4G to, with not just phones in its price range to consider, but also more expensive offerings with a similar spec list. Sony Xperia M2 The Sony Xperia M2 launched at a much higher price than the Moto G, but it's since plummeted to around £125/$190, suddenly making it a competitor. It has a larger but lower resolution 4.8-inch 540 x 960 display and the two phones are tied for power, so it's not looking good for the M2, but it beats out its Moto rival when it comes to battery life and it's arguably the more stylish handset. It also has an 8MP camera, which bests the Moto G on paper, though we weren't huge fans of the quality of the images it took. While it doesn't benefit from stock Android it does have an attractive interface of its own, though it's stuck on Android 4.4 KitKat, so the 3G version of the Moto G trumps it there and we expect the 4G version soon will too. We'd say the Moto G is a better buy in most ways, but if you're charger-shy the longer battery life on the Sony Xperia M2 could make it the smart option. Moto G (2014) Since launching the Moto G Motorola has followed it up with…the Moto G. So to avoid confusion we'll call the new one the Moto G (2014). The main change is the move to a bigger 5.0-inch screen, but that extra size won't suit fans of compact phones and the resolution hasn't changed, so it's not as sharp. The larger screen size also leads to a chunkier frame, leaving it less palm-friendly. It's no more powerful than the Moto G (2013) either but it does have a better 8MP camera on the back and an upgraded 2MP one on the front. Unless you really want a smaller screen the Moto G (2014) is clearly the better phone overall, despite its chunkier design, especially as it's now only marginally more expensive than the older model, starting at around £140/$180. Samsung Galaxy S4 Mini Put the Motorola Moto G up against the Samsung Galaxy S4 Mini and even then it's difficult to pick faults at the cheap handset. In fact the Moto G has a bigger screen than the S4 Mini (4.5 inches over 4.3) and a higher resolution (720 x 1280 versus 540 x 960), plus it's 1.2GHz quad-core processor is on par, if not better than the Samsung's 1.7GHz dual-core offering. The 3G Moto G even runs a newer version of Android - version 5.0 Lollipop - while the Galaxy S4 Mini is still languishing on KitKat. It's not looking good for the considerably more expensive Samsung. Naturally there are areas where the S4 Mini excels and its 8MP camera is a significantly better performer than the 5MP offering on the Moto G. It also brings 4G connectivity to the table, while you'll only get 3G on the Moto G, but considering the low cost of the Motorola you won't be disappointed. On paper both the Moto G and Moto G 4G look like excellent handsets for the price, and in practice they live up to the billing. As the Nexus 4 did with the mid-range market, the Moto G has turned the budget end on its head with features found on handsets double its cost. We liked The whole package. Look at what the Moto G offers, look at its price, and then look at the other handsets which cost the same amount. It exceeds its rivals in several key areas, from the well defined 4.5-inch display to its 1.2GHz quad-core processor and in some cases Android 5.0 Lollipop operating system. There's a lot to love about the Moto G for its price. You could easily be fooled into thinking that the Moto G costs the same as the Galaxy S4 Mini and the One Mini - even web browsing is impressive on the handset. We disliked It's simple. Motorola must have cut some corners to get the price of the Moto G so low, and the camera is one area which has seen the compromise. The 5MP lens is simply not up to the job and my photos either came out blurry, grainy or both, while the camera app itself will be far too basic for some. The lack of expandable memory will be a real bug bear for those who don't want to pay extra for the Moto G 4G, especially if you end up with the 8GB model and it's missing the more recent tech advances in the form of NFC. Verdict Motorola is back folks, it's official. It may not be the return I would have predicted - there's no flagship phone stuffed full of the latest tech - but arguably what the now Google-owned firm has done is even better. The Moto G is a top notch, low cost smartphone and I wholeheartedly recommend this as one of the best budget mobiles currently on the market. I was genuinely impressed with the feature set on the Moto G, so if you're looking for a low cost phone you can stop searching - just go out and grab a Moto G right now. The only difficult decision you have to make is whether or not to spend a little extra cash and plump for the 4G version with its microSD slot - if you like your apps, HD games and video on the go then it's a must - or keep up with the trends and get the larger, 5-inch Moto G (2014). If you're on a tight budget than the original Moto G or G 4G will still suffice, especially now that they're getting upgraded to Android Lollipop. The Moto G 2014 is a step up in price and size while sporting the same screen resolution and a similar design, although it's likely to be a little more future proof and completes the package more with enhanced cameras and additional features.

VIEW ALL PHOTOS IN GALLERY Google Home not only makes everyday tasks easier, it also allows for relatively straightforward DIY repairs. The teardown experts at iFixit give the smart device an above-average eight out of 10 for repairability, beating rival Amazon Echo, which earned a seven when it debuted in 2014. Unveiled during May's I/O developer conference, Google Home streams video and audio between Cast-enabled gadgets, letting you play music, search the Web, or control smart home devices. Standing 5.62 inches tall and 3.79 inches around, the 1.05-pound Google Home comes in white, with magnetic, swappable bases available in different colors and materials. A high-excursion speaker and micro-USB programming port are hidden underneath. VIEW ALL PHOTOS IN GALLERY Be careful, however, when removing the LED board, which is adhered to the upper case by "oodles of glue" and "seriously serious" adhesive tape, according to iFixit, which used a bit of heat and some isopropyl alcohol to break the barrier. Once inside, a round green grid sparkles with an array of capacitors that make up the speaker's touch-surface controls and 12 status LEDs; another set of capacitors are buried in deeper layer, the team said. On the grid's backside are the 32-bit ARM microcontroller, two LED drivers, and a pair of microphones. The iFixit team removed the stretchy o-ring before prying open the casing, which houses the motherboard and a slew of familiar-looking chips; the CPU, flash, and RAM also made an appearance in last year's Chromecast. //Related Articles Is Google Home Ready for Your Family? Perhaps most intriguing, however, is the mystery cable, sporting four contact points, uncovered in the bottom of the case. IFixit's "totally made up" theories for its use include the possibility that it recognizes the color of the base—carbon, copper, snow, mango, marine, violet, or slate. Better yet, maybe it's a vestigial charging mechanism or an "abandoned Easter egg dungeon level for teardown engineers." Overall, minimal moving parts, standard screws, and modular components means the Google Home is quite easy to repair.

After that check out our Election Night live blog. Here’s the latest, with all times PST: Related Articles Beyond the White House: Trends that will shape Bay Area races How late can I vote tonight? How to check if your mail-in ballot was counted Election Night live blog: The last cliffhangers 2:13 p.m.: Meanwhile over at Google, analysts are poring over search results throughout the day. As Carl Bialik with FiveThirtyEight explains, Google is “monitoring certain search terms to spot five categories of potential voting trouble: provisional ballots, long lines, inactive voter status, voting-machine problems and voter intimidation. Dots on a U.S. map show places where searches for terms related to any of those categories are spiking. The Electionland project that’s coordinating nationwide journalistic coverage of voting problems is tapping into the Google data for tips on where to investigate.” And over at Electionland, where Google and ProPublica are teaming up, check out the maps borne of all those searches: What does it all mean? “Bursts of blue reflect places where searchers are seeking information about provisional ballots. Arizona, Ohio and California had the highest interest in this topic, three to four times the national average. Splotches of pink mark areas complaining of broken voting machines, the biggest and brightest in Rhode Island and Pennsylvania. ”Search interest about lines peaked at around 7 a.m. in Georgia, soon after polls opened, reaching almost five times the national average. ”Google can also look deeper into state-level data to find localities where search interest in an issue is particularly intense. The city where interest in voter intimidation was highest? Pittsfield Charter Township, Michigan. ”There are 3 billion Google searches on a typical day. Election Day is not typical, this year especially – election-related searches are 500 percent higher than they were for the same period in 2012, Google said.” 1 p.m.: News just in from Nevada where a judge has thrown out Trump’s legal challenge alleging improprieties in early voting around Las Vegas. And then District Judge Gloria Sturman blasted Trump’s lawyers for trying to obtain the names of paid and volunteer poll workers, saying that would expose them to all sorts of abuse from Trump’s supporters online, according to the LA Times: “Do you watch Twitter?” Sturman said. “Have you watched any cable news shows? There are Internet – you know the vernacular – trolls who could get this information and harass people. Why would I order them to make available to you information about people who work at polls? I am not going to issue any order,” Sturman said. “I am not going to do that.” The Trump campaign wants to make names of Nevada poll workers public. Judge's response: pic.twitter.com/tes99IMbbH — Deadspin (@Deadspin) November 8, 2016 (Note: Deadspin, a sports website launched by Gawker, is now owned by Univision) 11 a.m.: From Clinton stronghold Broward County, just north of Miami, election officials say just over 100,000 people had voted by mid-day. With another 622,000 having already cast their ballots in early voting and by mail, that means that all-important Florida’s bluest county reached a 62-percent turnout rate. And that, of course, is hopeful news for Clinton as she’s neck-and-neck with Trump in statewide polls going into the election. They key, says the Miami Herald, is for Clinton  “to drive up Democratic turnout in South Florida counties to wipe out Republican votes for Trump in less populous and more conservative counties in northern Florida.”   10:50 a.m.: In an informal poll among investors who hang out at the Wall Street Oasis forum, Clinton seemed be the favorite choice. A guy nicknamed Dick Fuld kicked things off with this: “I don’t care who you WANT to win, I only care who you think will win and with what degree of confidence you have in your prediction.” And the respondents clearly thought the race was Hillary’s to lose, with everything from 51 to 100 percent surety.   10:45 a.m.: The Trump camp populates the Twittersphere, with son Eric sounding a clarion call for supporters to Just Do It: Initial numbers look great but you have to get out and VOTE! Let's #DrainTheSwamp! https://t.co/27k5n882TU pic.twitter.com/jyMnQsrG3J — Eric Trump (@EricTrump) November 8, 2016 At the same time, Trump is being trashed on Twitter for peeking at his wife’s ballot:   10:39: The folks behind the push to legalize recreational marijuana in California just announced the Yes on Prop. 64 campaign will throw a bash in San Francisco tonight starting 8 p.m.  Another event will take place in LA where backers of the measure will “watch the historic results and celebrate the hard work of its diverse coalition.” On hand in SF will be Prop. 64’s poster child, California Lt. Governor Gavin Newsom. That event will take place at VERSO, 1525 Mission Street. 10:22 a.m.: From Politico comes word a few moments ago that Clinton received some good news from middle-of-nowhere New England: “Dixville Notch, the quirky northern New Hampshire town that traditionally votes early on Election Day, has tallied this year’s results — and Hillary Clinton is the local winner. Clinton won four votes, while Donald Trump picked up two. Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson earned one vote, as did former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney, who isn’t running. “The small community — with a registered population of 12 in the 2010 census — is known for its tradition of casting their ballots shortly after midnight on Election Day while gathered in a single ballroom. The tradition dates back to 1960, when the town cast its nine votes for Richard Nixon’s presidential bid.” Over at FiveThirtyEight, that bastion of political analysis, Harry Enten just weighed in with this dispatch from the frontlines: “I just voted in New York, where long lines have plagued many polling stations. That includes the one across the street from my apartment.” At the polling place across the street, there is, to put it mildly, a line out the door… pic.twitter.com/daXtR1L5D4 — (((Harry Enten))) (@ForecasterEnten) November 8, 2016 Also at FiveThirtyAnn, Ulia Azari just reported some strange things going on at some Chicago polling places: “A friend in Chicago reports some pretty disturbing events from the polls this morning. She’s African-American and her husband is white, and they had pretty different experiences at their voting location. She was asked for a photo ID; he wasn’t. She only received part of her ballot at first, and they gave her the other half after she’d already started filling out the first part. Her husband also reported that the only other white voter in line, a man wearing a suit, was invited to cut in line because he was clearly “in a hurry.” (The man declined.) I have no idea if this is representative of what’s happening elsewhere, but it’s not encouraging.” There are plenty of ways to watch tonight’s election results, starting with our own Facebook Live streams. CNN offers a smorgasbord of methods to access tonight’s breaking news: 10 a.m.: From CNN: “Here are *some* of the extraordinary elements of our coverage, and where you can find us beyond CNN TV and CNN.com. We’ll be live streaming … CNN will stream live its broadcast coverage across digital platforms from 4 p.m. ET Election Day to 4 a.m.Wednesday. We are live blogging … As you watch CNN TV on the screen of your choice, linger on our live blog for a dynamic conversation. It’s up starting NOW and will run nonstop for the next 48 hours through to Wednesday afternoon.” 950 a.m.: And that’s just the tip of the online iceberg. Consider checking out these sources, too, from Gizmodo: “NBC News has a livestream of election night coverage on YouTube. PBS Newshour also has a livestream of the election results on YouTube. And C-SPAN has its own stream of the results on YouTube. Twitter partnered with Bloomberg for coverage of the debates, but tonight they’re partnering with Buzzfeed News. Those cheating scamps. You can watch Twitter’s coverage at election.twitter.com or through the Twitter app on Apple TV, Amazon Fire, or Xbox One.” 9:45 a.m.: A cross-voter weighs in: I am a Young Democrat and on this historic #ElectionDay I cast #MyVote2016 for Donald J Trump. And it felt… good. — Democrats for Trump (@YoungDems4Trump) November 8, 2016   9:11 a.m. Trump weighs in early with: ‏@realDonaldTrump 30m30 minutes ago VOTE TODAY!

It has been in science fiction books and movies for quite some time. The concept of a driverless car is neither new nor all that difficult to imagine; it has been around in science fiction for quite some time.  One particularly clear implementation of the idea was in Minority Report, a movie set in the future and released in 2002.  But in the actual world, it took a more practical shape starting early this decade when Google announced that it was working on a driverless car that would be able to navigate cities, full of their usual hustle-bustle, with ease. Now in 2016, almost every company that has anything to do with commuting and cars is working on a driverless car.  Google, being an early pioneer in the field, is giving final touches to its cute and cuddly small car that neither has brakes that a person can control nor the steering wheel. Then there is Uber, one of the biggest cab aggregators in the world.  It has partnered with Ford and has modified the Fiestas, which it now is using as driverless cabs as a sort of trial run in Pittsburgh, the US. But these are not the only companies eyeing driverless cars.  All big car companies, including Volvo and Mercedes, are working on cars that can drive themselves. Even a company like LeEco, a China-based technology company, has partnered with Faraday Future to create a driverless car, which it hopes to unveil within a few months from now in the early next year.  Then there is Tesla, a US-based electrical car company led by billionaire Elon Musk. The company is already selling cars that have the auto pilot feature, which allows drivers to leave the control of the vehicle on a highway when it is cruising.  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next TECH A LOOK: From RAM to Anti-Virus Apps... the biggest... 'India is doing ok... but it'll never be China': Top asset... Share this article Share In the auto mode, a Tesla Model S or a Model X, follow the cars ahead of them at a safe distance and at a required speed.  And although many have criticised Tesla’s auto pilot as dangerous, the company maintains that it is semiautonomous for now with the fully driverless feature to be enabled in future with a software update in the existing cars.  All driverless cars, whether they are running on the roads of Singapore or trying to push to their limits in a test lab, use more or less the same technology. They have sensors and cameras, which allows them to collect data from around them.  The most important of these sensors is the ladar a.k.a. laserbased radar. This data is then analysed using billions of calculations every second, which in turn determines how the car behaves.  “We’ve taught our cars to navigate through many complicated scenarios on city streets,” notes Google.  “Our cars use their sensors and software to sense objects like pedestrians, cyclists, vehicles and more, and are designed to safely drive around them."  After years of research, the technology behind driverless cars has become standardised. But the laws are yet to catch up to it.  The big questions of ethics and civility around the driverless cars remain unsolved.  In case of an impending accident, should the computer work to save the occupant of the car or the pedestrians? That is a question far more complex than it seems.  And that is just one question. It is also a question that governments across the world are pondering. Last month, US president Barack Obama wrote in an op-ed that “in the sevenand- a-half years of my presidency, self-driving cars have gone from sci-fi fantasy to an emerging reality” but they need rules before they can hit Share or comment on this article e-mail Bing Site Web Enter search term: Search     DON'T MISS It's getting hot in here!

TechRadar pro IT insights for business Search RSS News Reviews Insights TechRadar Business Laptop/PC Printers Hardware Software Mobile working Security Networks Management Data centre & Cloud News Microsoft patches nasty Windows 10 security flaw outed by Google Microsoft patches nasty Windows 10 security flaw outed by Google By Joe Osborne Security software   As promised, but not before hackers took advantage Shares On October 31, Google publicly outed Microsoft for a critical zero-day security flaw in Windows 10 just 10 days after reporting the vulnerability to the firm. Today, as promised in a subsequent (and angry) blog post, Microsoft has patched up the hole and more in a round of updates. The issue was said to allow hackers to easily work around the operating system’s (OS) security sandbox, letting them to execute harmful code, delete data and create user accounts with full access to the OS and "take control of an affected system,” Microsoft wrote in a security bulletin following its usual patch day. In order to exploit the security hole, however, the end user would have to be tricked into opening an app created specifically for this purpose and remain logged in for the hacker to do any real damage. Back on November 1, Microsoft even claimed in that blog post that the flaw was not exploitable if you were running the then-latest version of its new OS. See why you should still consider buying a Surface Pro 3  How long is long enough? Last week, Google justified publicizing the so-called Win32k Information Disclosure Vulnerability early in citing evidence that the flaw was already being exploited by hackers. Normally, Google gives fellow firms three months to sort their security issues before making them public. Citing the urgent nature of this particular security flaw, Google broke that rule rather quickly. This caused Microsoft executive Terry Myerson to lash out a bit at the search giant in the aforementioned blog post, claiming that its move only put more of its users at risk, though recognized the Google researcher’s hard work. Protect yourself with one of 2016’s best security suites While Google took matters into its own hands for the sake of the public, it’s obvious that the two companies are rivals in several respects – namely in that both are fervently competing for market share in regards to their operating systems. Outside looking in, it’s impossible to say whether one party drug its feet in delivering a fix or the other had ulterior motives in disclosing the flaw publicly. Regardless, it’s important to recognize the environment and circumstances surrounding both in this exchange. To ensure that you’re protected from the flaw, make sure to update your version of Windows 10 today. Oh, and give your system a quick malware scan for good measure.

Mark Bergen @mhbergen More stories by Mark Bergen November 8, 2016 — 3:31 PM EST A Project Wing prototype during a test flight. Source: Project Wing, Alphabet iNc. The latest Google drones have just started taking flight in the real world. But the team behind the technology is slowing down, trimming headcount and shelving initiatives as the experimental unit becomes the latest target of tightening budgets across parent company Alphabet Inc.  Project Wing, a unit of Alphabet's X research lab, nixed a partnership with coffee giant Starbucks Corp., according to people familiar with the decision. Following the departure of project leader Dave Vos in October, the unit also froze hiring and began asking some staff to seek jobs elsewhere in the company, according to some of those people. They asked not to be identified speaking about private company moves.  The decisions are part of a broader Alphabet effort to rein in spending and try to turn more experimental projects from loss-making risky bets into real businesses. Drones are in a particularly knotty place. U.S. federal regulation does not yet allow for delivery, except in select test zones. However, Alphabet's deceleration comes as other technology companies, including Amazon.com Inc., plow money into drone delivery. "Project Wing has the potential to remove a big chunk of the friction in how physical things are moved around in the world," a spokeswoman for X wrote in an e-mail. "What we’re doing now is developing the next phase of our technology, and as always are thinking in a very broad way about all the potential use cases for delivery by unmanned aerial systems." QuickTake Read More: Domesticating Drones In August, Project Wing won approval for test flights at a U.S. site, part of a White House effort to encourage unmanned vehicle delivery. Then in September, Alphabet announced a new foray: a partnership with Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. to deliver food via drone at Virginia Tech. Robotic burrito drop-offs are a far cry from Google's initial aims. The unit first wanted to deploy drones to deliver health-care items, such as medicine and heart defibrillators. After those plans were scrapped, the unit moved to food and other perishables. Alphabet was in advanced talks with Starbucks and had tested delivery with the coffee-chain operator, according to two people familiar with the plans. Those plans were nixed, largely over disagreements about the access to customer data that Alphabet wanted, according to a former X employee. A Starbucks representative didn't respond to a request for comment on Tuesday.  Similarly, the unit was in talks to provide suburban grocery delivery in Ireland, where drone rules are less stringent than in the U.S. Amazon's Prime Air service, a competing effort to use unmanned vehicles, announced it was testing with the British government this summer.  The status of Project Wing's effort in Ireland is unclear. An X spokeswoman declined to comment on those talks, as well as the Starbucks partnership and hiring decisions.  Course Correction Exclusive insights in your inbox, from our technology reporters around the world.

Early on, under the leadership of Massachusetts Institute of Technology roboticist Nicholas Roy, it operated like an academic research project, according to former employees. Vos, who joined Google in 2014, steered a different course. The aerospace veteran increased simulation testing for the drones and implemented a new product review system that reflected standards in the aviation industry, which are more rigorous than software testing, the former employees said.  Project Wing also hinted at aspirations aligned to Google's mission -- data collection along with delivery logistics. Last year, Vos detailed Project Wing's ambition to run an air-traffic control hub for a drone-based economy. He described plans to equip drones with radio transponders that communicate with controllers and other aircraft by 2020. Then Vos suddenly left. Alphabet did not name a successor. The project now reports to Astro Teller, the longtime chief of X. Vos did not immediately respond to e-mails seeking comment on Tuesday. Teller is still making bold predictions for the technology. In an interview published on Tuesday with The Verge, Teller said the drone program could spell the end of an ownership society and "really dramatically, magically, change the world." However, the drone team is now undergoing similar financial scrutiny as other Alphabet experimental arms, such as its Google Fiber and robotics units. Several Project Wing employees have received "90-day notices," which are requests to find different jobs inside Alphabet before being terminated, according to one person familiar with the decision.  Last November, Vos told an aviation conference that Project Wing planned to have a "commercial business up in running in 2017." It is unclear if his exit and the staff changes will delay that timeline. Some in the nascent industry are skeptical that any company can move beyond test sites in the U.S. in the next one or two years, given Federal Aviation Administration restrictions. "You're not even allowed to ask for a waiver to fly beyond the visual line of sight if it's delivery," said Gretchen A. West, a drone specialist at law firm Hogan Lovells, who is not familiar with Project Wing's plans. "Nobody knows how long it's going to take." Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

It’s one way for hyperconvergence to finally make inroads, and for vendors of hyperscale hardware to spread out their customer base, between mid-level enterprises looking to deploy hybrid clouds, and corporations that need workload portability across continents.  Live migration of virtual machines makes something called “portability” feasible today, but distributing pieces of workloads (minus the overhead of VM operating systems and libraries) across cloud platforms, on-premises and in public spaces, requires a more effective orchestrator. To this end, Kubernetes (with Google’s backing) is competing against Apache Mesos in the open source space. “The first thing you have to do, when you’re making this move toward Kubernetes and cloud-native architectures,” said Cisco’s Owens today, “is you have to know where you’re going.  You have to have a vision, and have a set direction that you want to get to, and think about how you’re going to get there.  Don’t just start — Everyone just starts doing proofs-of-concept, and plays around with the technology.  That’s all good things to do, but at some point you have to know where you’re going to head with this new technology, and what you want to do as your organization grows.” Whose Level Playing Field Is It? Taken out of context and read as a paragraph by itself, Owens’ statement may seem a little generic.  But here, in this particular venue, there’s a point to his statement that could very easily be missed. The CNCF is a Linux Foundation project that came together in 2015 with the objective of assembling a platform around containerized workloads — the kind made popular that year by the rapid rise of Docker.  Google rapidly took the lead with the CNCF group, contributing code based on an orchestration concept it originally built in-house, called “Borg.”  The CNCF’s founding came literally on the heels of the creation of the Open Container Initiative, launched after Docker Inc. donated a critical piece of containerization technology — the container runtime — to the open source community. At first, there was confusion and even some dispute over why the OCI and CNCF were founded separately.  Didn’t both foundations seek to advance the cause of containerization? But since the start of this year, OCI’s mission started centering around standardizing the container format, which ended up helping wean containers from their tight association with Docker.  CNCF, meanwhile, focused on the orchestration of workloads, which include Docker and CoreOS rkt containers, but which have the theoretical possibility of expanding in scope.  For example, a China-based firm called Hyper has constructed a way for Kubernetes to orchestrate hypervisor-driven workloads, and to pair containers with a new kind of hypervisor. This while VMware (which we can assume will refuse to pay for any wall) “embraces and extends” the containerization concept, taking after Microsoft.  It’s built two container platforms of its own — one which pairs containerized workloads with VMware ESX hypervisors in a hybrid environment with vSphere, and another which would replace vSphere with a fully containerized system built on its NSX network virtualization platform. In both of those environments, however, it may be possible to run Kubernetes.  And if you’re asking why, consider that vSphere’s management environment may not have the flexibility to control microservices in a manner that makes them scalable.  Theoretically, VMware’s platform can be set to manage lower-level infrastructure, while Kubernetes devotes itself purely to making microservices work on the upper tier of a cloud-native architecture. Point of Reference On Tuesday, CNCF Executive Director Dan Kohn gave attendees their first peek at what that architecture would look like, at least on paper.  In version 0.9 of what it calls Cloud Native Reference Architecture (not to be confused with the IBM project with the same name) various open source components including Docker and Kubernetes are distributed among tiers in a five-ply stack: from top to bottom, Application Definition / Development, Orchestration and Management, Runtime, Provisioning, and Infrastructure.  Arguably, Kubernetes would have a place in the second layer from the top, and Docker and CoreOS rkt (pronounced “rocket”) one layer below. “In the era of GitHub, people do not need to be told what to do, they need help, services and common infrastructure that we can provide,” wrote CNCF Technical Committee Chairman Alexis Richardson (also the CEO of SDN software maker Weave), in a CNCF blog post published Tuesday.  “We ask them how we can help — we don’t tell them, we don’t make them join committees.  We love open source, which is fast, more than open standards, which are important but emerge slowly over time.  We are not a kingmaker organization — we believe the market and community will select leaders (plural) in time.” It’s another way of saying, don’t build walls.  The problem is, with five tiers in the emerging CNCF reference architecture, there are at least four opportunities for some very tall walls — or some nice fences.

The feature was removed “due to low usage,” a Google spokesperson has told us. Google told us they have “retired this feature” since it was not used as often as they would have liked. The Knowledge Graph popup in the snippets first launched in January 22, 2014. So after two and a half years, Google decided to drop the feature. Here is a screen shot of what the feature looked like and did: It was first noticed as being removed by RankRanger on November 3, 2016.

With Android Nougat the company waited a couple of months to release that document and today, it’s finally here. The 85-page document spells out Google’s plans for Android OEMs, and while most of the document is relatively unimportant for most people, there are some points worth talking about… “Android Extensions” The first big talking point, unearthed by Ars Technica, is “Android Extensions.” While we don’t fully know what Google has in store for this, it seems like it could be used by Google to bypass manufacturers and carriers to push AOSP API updates to the entire Android ecosystem at once. Currently, the APKs that power “Android Extensions” on the Google Pixel and LG V20 are mostly blank slates, but over time Google could use this to push more updates to Android’s core without requiring full system updates. With that said, Ron Amadeo from Ars Technica explains this better than I can: We have a theory: “Android Extensions” is a plan to bring the easily updatable app model to the AOSP APIs. Like Google Play Services, we think this app will be a bundle of API shims that Google can update whenever it wants. The difference is that everything in Play Services is a closed-source Google API, while “Android Extensions” would be collections of fresh AOSP code delivered directly to your device via the Play Store. The CDD’s stipulation that OEMs “MUST preload the AOSP implementation” is telling. It says that 1) this is AOSP code, and 2) OEMs aren’t allowed to “customize” it. And here’s the text straight from the CDD: 3.1.1. Android Extensions Android includes the support of extending the managed APIs while keeping the same API level version. Android device implementations MUST preload the AOSP implementation of both the shared library ExtShared and services ExtServices with versions higher than or equal to the minimum versions allowed per each API level. For example, Android 7.0 device implementations, running API level 24 MUST include at least version 1. Google May Force OEMs To Stop Using Proprietary Charging Standards Another important change is this document is Google attempting to push OEMs away from proprietary charging standards. If you ask me, this is the most important consumer-facing aspect of this document. Right now there are several different fast charging “standards” on the market ─ Qualcomm Quick Charge, OnePlus Dash Charge, Motorola Turbo Charging, Huawei SuperCharge, MediaTek Pump Express, and OPPO VOOC just to name a few. Even though Quick Charge is the most widely used standard out today, it doesn’t work on every phone, and Google wants to change that. On the Pixel and last year’s Nexus devices, Google uses USB Power Delivery for fast charging. Not only does this allow fasting charging, but it’s also compatible with all chipsets. That means that, in a perfect world, everyone could use the same fast chargers on all smartphones. In the current Android CDD, Google is “strongly recommending” that OEMs adopt USB PD, Google may later force this functionality as Android Police pointed out: Type-C devices are STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to not support proprietary charging methods that modify Vbus voltage beyond default levels, or alter sink/source roles as such may result in interoperability issues with the chargers or devices that support the standard USB Power Delivery methods. While this is called out as “STRONGLY RECOMMENDED”, in future Android versions we might REQUIRE all type-C devices to support full interoperability with standard type-C chargers Nougat Doesn’t Require Vulkan APIs One other thing discovered in the CDD is confirmation that Nougat doesn’t require a chipset capable of using Vulkan APIs in order to run. It was rumored earlier in the year that this was Google’s primary reason for dropping devices like the Nexus 5 as well as OEMs for dropping devices running on older Qualcomm chipsets, but clearly, that isn’t the issue we once thought it was. Device implementations, if not including support of the Vulkan APIs: MUST report 0 VkPhysicalDevices through the vkEnumeratePhysicalDevices call. MUST NOT delare any of the Vulkan feature flags PackageManager#FEATURE_VULKAN_HARDWARE_LEVEL and PackageManager#FEATURE_VULKAN_HARDWARE_VERSION. Multi-Window Support Must Follow AOSP A feature that OEMs have long had, but Google waited on implementing is multi-window. It wasn’t until Nougat that Google added this feature as a part of the OS, but there was still concern that OEMs would try to make the feature “their own.” Thankfully, they won’t have the chance. A portion of the CDD strictly states the OEMs cannot implement any multi-window form aside from what is found in AOSP. We can already see this in action on Nougat-powered devices like Huawei Mate 9 and LG V20. Also worth noting, OEMs do have the option of not implementing multi-window if they choose to do so. For the most part, it’s unlikely that OEMs might skip this feature, but I could absolutely see it happening on devices with small screens oinadequatete performance. 3.8.14. Multi-windows A device implementation MAY choose not to implement any multi-window modes, but if it has the capability to display multiple activities at the same time it MUST implement such multi-window mode(s) in accordance with the application behaviors and APIs described in the Android SDK multi-window mode support documentation and meet the following requirements. All Android Smartphones Must Support Call Blocking The last big thing we’ll point out regards call blocking. In Nougat, OEMs must support number blocking for calls and messages. This includes adding a UI to manage blocked numbers. We can also see this in action on the Huawei Mate 9 which is running Nougat. 7.4.1.1. Number Blocking Compatibility Android Telephony device implementations MUST include number blocking support and: MUST fully implement BlockedNumberContract and the corresponding API as described in the SDK documentation. MUST block all calls and messages from a phone number in ‘BlockedNumberProvider’ without any interaction with apps. The only exception is when number blocking is temporarily lifted as described in the SDK documentation. MUST NOT write to the platform call log provider for a blocked call. MUST NOT write to the telephony provider for a blocked message. MUST implement a blocked numbers management UI, which is opened with the intent returned by TelecomManager.createManageBlockedNumbersIntent() method. MUST NOT allow secondary users to view or edit the blocked numbers on the device as the Android platform assumes the primary user to have full control of the telephony Page 59 of 85 services, a single instance, on the device. All blocking related UI MUST be hidden for secondary users and the blocked list MUST still be respected. SHOULD migrate the blocked numbers into the provider when a device updates to Android 7.0. These are just a few of the big changes from Nougat’s CDD ─ there are undoubtedly many more. Just from these, however, we can see that Google is working step-by-step to take back portions of Android, and we can see those results in Nougat. We’ve listed a few other changes below. Android Auto The Nougat CDD reveals updated specs on hardware requirements for Android Auto stereos including the size and resolution. It also shows that temperature sensors used with Android Auto must measure the cabin of the vehicle. Android Automotive devices MUST have a screen with the physical diagonal size greater than or equal to 6 inches. Android Automotive devices MUST have a screen size of at least 750 dp x 480 dp. For Android Automotive implementations, SENSOR_TYPE_AMBIENT_TEMPERATURE MUST measure the temperature inside the vehicle cabin. Audio The document also lays out information on how Android devices should handle remote controls on headphones connected via a 3.5mm headphone jack. 7.8.2.1 Analog Audio Ports In order to be compatible with the headsets and other audio accessories using the 3.5mm audio plug across the Android ecosystem, if a device implementation includes one or more analog audio ports, at least one of the audio port(s) SHOULD be a 4 conductor 3.5mm audio jack. If a device implementation has a 4 conductor 3.5mm audio jack, it: MUST support the detection and mapping to the keycodes for the following 3 ranges of equivalent impedance between the microphone and ground conductors on the audio plug: 70 ohm or less : KEYCODE_HEADSETHOOK 210-290 Ohm : KEYCODE_VOLUME_UP 360-680 Ohm : KEYCODE_VOLUME_DOWN Package Manager Nougat also adds a requirement for installing APKs. More details on that can be found here. The package manager MUST support verifying “.apk” files using the APK Signature Scheme v2. Display Settings that change Display Density/Size must follow AOSP’s implementation: Device implementations are STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to provide users a setting to change the display size. If there is an implementation to change the display size of the device, it MUST align with the AOSP implementation Guides Android Breaking news for Android.

Resend activation e-mail Risk Assessment / Security & Hacktivism Google stops AdSense attack that forced banking trojan on Android phones Malicious ads exploited zero-day flaw in Android that auto downloaded files. by Dan Goodin - Nov 8, 2016 10:10 pm UTC Login to bookmark 51 Enlarge Google has shut down an operation that combined malicious AdSense advertisements with a zero-day attack exploiting Chrome for Android to force devices to download banking fraud malware. Over a two-month span, the campaign downloaded the Banker.AndroidOS.Svpeng banking trojan on about 318,000 devices monitored by Kaspersky Lab, researchers from the Moscow-based anti-malware provider reported in a blog post published Monday. While the malicious installation files weren't automatically executed, they carried names such as last-browser-update.apk and WhatsApp.apk that were designed to trick targets into manually installing them. Kaspersky privately reported the scam to Google, and engineers from the search company put an end to the campaign, although the timing of those two events wasn't immediately clear. "So far, those behind Svpeng have limited their attacks to smartphone users in Russia," Kaspersky Lab researchers Nikita Buchka and Anton Kivva wrote in Monday's post. "However, next time they push their 'adverts' on AdSense they may well choose to attack users in other countries; we have seen similar cases in the past. After all, what could be more convenient than exploiting the most popular advertising platform to download their malicious creations to hundreds of thousands of mobile devices?" A Google spokesman said a fix for the auto-download vulnerability was being tested in Chrome version 54 and was expected to be "live 100%" in version 55. (He didn't respond to a request asking him to elaborate.) He also said an Android security feature known as Verify Apps provided warnings when people tried to install one of the malicious apps. He didn't explain how the malicious advertisements snuck by Google security checks or what company engineers are doing to prevent AdSense from running similar ones in the future. Last week, researchers from a separate security firm named Cylance disclosed a separate malvertising campaign on Google AdWords that targeted Mac users. Kaspersky Lab researchers said it was clear from lulls in the campaign that someone or something inside Google detected and removed many of the malicious ads distributing the Svpeng installation files. But even after old ones were expelled, new ones managed to take their place. "The high rates and abrupt changes in the number of detections are easy to explain: Google has been quick to block the ads that the trojan uses for propagation," the researchers wrote. "However, this is a reactive rather than proactive approach—the malicious ads were blocked after the trojan was already on thousands of Android devices. It is also worth noting that there were multiple occasions in the past two months when these ads found their way on to AdSense; similar attacks have been occurring up to the present time, with the most recent attack registered on 19 October 2016." Monday's report is yet another reminder why it's generally a good idea not to change default Android settings preventing the installation of apps not carried in the official Google Play app bazaar. It also reaffirms the importance of remaining highly skeptical of webpages encouraging users to install files. Google deserves credit for quickly removing malicious ads and creating safety nets such as Verify Apps and a default prohibition on installing third-party apps, but as the Kaspersky Lab researchers point out, these approaches reactively treat the symptoms rather than curing the underlying disease.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Danielle Paquette November 8 Follow @dpaqreport Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump holds a campaign event at in Jacksonville, Fla., on Nov. 3. (Carlo Allegri/Reuters)   On the day Americans are picking our next president, the dominant Google search was … abortion. The issue shared the top slot with immigration for much of Tuesday, suggesting voters wanted to learn more about where the candidates stand on reproductive rights: (Courtesy of Google Trends) The Republican nominee appeared to spark much of the interest. Searches of “Trump on abortion” had spiked more than 4,000 percent by late afternoon. Relative to immigration and the Islamic State, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump didn’t tangle much over abortion during the campaign, save for one high-profile exchange in the final presidential debate. Trump had slammed his opponent’s stance on abortion, mischaracterizing the kind of procedures he argued she would allow. “If you go with what Hillary is saying, in the ninth month, you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb of the mother just prior to the birth of the baby,” Trump said on Oct. 19. “Well, that is not what happens in these cases,” Clinton replied. “And using that kind of scare rhetoric is just terribly unfortunate.” The dispute renewed the discussion around late-term abortions, which happen extremely rarely in the United States, and generally only when the health of the mother or the fetus is failing. (Fewer than 1.3 percent of abortions in the country occurred later than 21 weeks, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and doctors won't perform the procedure at nine months.) ['Rip the baby out of the womb': What Donald Trump got wrong about abortion in America] That interest in abortion surged Tuesday isn’t that surprising. It remains one of the most fiercely divisive topics in the country: 56 percent of U.S. adults say it should be legal in all or most cases, while 41 percent say they feel it should be banned all or most of the time, according to a June analysis from the Pew Research Center. Both candidates’ broad stances match their party’s: Clinton says that she’ll defend access to the procedure, and Trump implied the Supreme Court under his leadership would overturn Roe v. Wade, the 1973 case that guaranteed an American woman’s right to terminate a pregnancy.   Since announcing her candidacy last year, Clinton has been clear on where she stands, arguing that Medicaid, the public health insurance for the poor, should cover low-income women who seek abortions. Trump, however, has broadcast a more confusing message. Before 2011, he publicly supported abortion rights. Last year, he described himself as “pro-life.” And throughout the campaign, he has sent mixed signals to voters. As The Post’s Philip Bump noted, he took five different positions on abortion in three days. In March, Trump declared women who get an abortion should face punishment. His campaign put out a conflicting statement a few hours later, asserting the physicians who perform the procedures should be punished — not the women. In April, Trump said the legality of abortion should be left up to the states. “The laws are set now on abortion and that’s the way they're going to remain until they’re changed,” he said, according to CBS’s transcript. “I would’ve preferred states’ rights. I think it would’ve been better if it were up to the states. But right now, the laws are set. ... At this moment, the laws are set. And I think we have to leave it that way.” [The gruesome language antiabortion activists are using to win support] In the last debate, he added that leaving such decisions to the states, once he’s elected, would naturally result in the illegalization of abortion. “Well, if we put another two or perhaps three justice on, that will happen,” Trump said. “And that'll happen automatically, in my opinion, because I am putting pro-life justices on the court. I will say this: It will go back to the states, and the states will then make a determination.” Clinton, by contrast, vowed to protect the law. “I strongly support Roe v. Wade,” she said, “which guarantees a constitutional right to a woman to make the most intimate, most difficult, in many cases, decisions about her health care that one can imagine.” More from Wonkblog: Ginsburg smacks down a major abortion myth after historic SCOTUS ruling Anderson Cooper told Trump 'That is sexual assault.'

Google fixed dozens of vulnerabilities in its November update. Google on Nov. 7 released its November Android patches, which provide 83 fixes for vulnerabilities across three patch levels. Across the patch levels—a complete patch level identified as 2016-11-05, a partial patch level identified as 2016-11-01 and the 2016-11-06 supplementary patch level—Google is patching a total of 13 vulnerabilities rated as having critical impact. Among the critical flaws being patched is CVE-2016-5195, also known as the so-called "Dirty COW" vulnerability in Linux. The Dirty COW flaw is a privilege escalation that abuses the Copy On Write (COW) capabilities in the upstream Linux kernel. The issue was first fixed in Linux on Oct. 19. Google has included the fix for CVE-2016-5195 in its supplementary patch-level grouping. "Supplemental security patch levels are provided to identify devices that contain fixes for issues that were publicly disclosed after the patch level was defined," Google stated in its November security bulletin."Addressing these recently disclosed vulnerabilities is not required until the 2016-12-01 security patch level." The Dirty COW issue is only one of 16 critical privilege escalation vulnerabilities that Google patched in November. Seven of the critical privilege escalation issues were found in the Nvidia GPU driver. The kernel file system is responsible for three of the privilege escalation flaws with CVE-2015-8961, CVE-2016-7910 and CVE-2016-7911.Three additional privilege escalation flaws were found in other parts of the Android kernel, including the SCSI driver (CVE-2015-8962), kernel media driver (CVE-2016-7913), kernel USB driver (CVE-2016-7912) and the kernel ION subsystem (CVE-2016-6728). There is also a critical privilege escalation flaw in the Qualcomm bootloader. Qualcomm overall has been a source of many patched vulnerabilities in Android in recent months. In the October update, Qualcomm was the leading source of vulnerabilities with 30 patched flaws. For the November update, Qualcomm components account for 17 flaws in total, including four critical flaws (CVE-2016-6726, CVE-2016-6727, CVE-2016-6728 and CVE-2016-6725), five high-impact flaws and eight issues identified as having moderate impact. Android's mediaserver component once again is also part of Google's patch update. There are a total of 13 patches in the November update for mediaserver-related flaws, though only one of them is rated as critical (CVE-2016-6699). Android's media server and related libraries have been under scrutiny from security researchers since June 2015, when the first Stagefright flaw was revealed.

Good News: It Isn’t Just You Scroll to see how election-related search terms correlate—both positively and negatively—with depression-related and anxiety-related search terms. WIRED/Maimuna Majumder When it comes to maintaining the mental health and wellness of American citizens, the 2016 presidential election cycle has been less than ideal. In a recent article in Politico, therapists and their clients described how the last several months of political turmoil have thrown them for a loop. One psychologist even commissioned a poll of 1,000 voter-age respondents to probe the emotional impact of the election. The results: Nearly 30 percent of respondents reported emotional distress due to Hillary Clinton’s campaign, while over 40 percent reported emotional distress due to Donald Trump’s campaign. Perhaps most tellingly, a whopping 90 percent of those who reported emotional distress felt that the toll of this election was worse than any other election in the past, offering perspective into the general American psyche right about now. But most public health issues—including mental wellbeing—impact different people differently. Women are more likely to seek care for mental health issues than men, for example, while younger individuals are less likely to seek care than older men and women. Similarly, we might expect the mental health and wellness of certain groups of Americans to be more susceptible to the impact of the 2016 presidential election cycle. The effects could vary across state and party lines. Maimuna Majumder About Maimuna Majumder is an Engineering Systems PhD candidate at MIT and computational epidemiology research fellow at HealthMap. Her research interests involve probabilistic modeling, Bayesian statistics, and “systems epidemiology” in the context of emerging infectious diseases. So we tried to test this hypothesis. By looking at Google search traffic across the United States, we attempted to determine if anxiety- and depression-related terms correlated with searches for election-related terms—and if so, in which states and in what direction? Over the last several years, Google search traffic has been validated as an effective proxy for a variety of public health issues, including not only infectious diseases like Zika, dengue, and influenza, but mental health as well. When data on the incidence or prevalence of health conditions isn’t readily available—or is expected to be under-reported due to lack of care seeking—Google search traffic can help public health practitioners estimate trends. While searches for anxiety- and depression-related terms are likely a reasonable indicator for mental wellbeing, correlation against election-related searches doesn’t mean that the election caused changes in mental health. This kind of analysis merely allows us to explore the possibility that trends in mental health—as associated with the 2016 presidential election cycle (but not necessarily because of it)—may vary from one state to the next and, more generally, between red, blue, and swing categories. Insights like these may shed light on which groups, if any, should be surveyed to look for causal relationships. And if those relationships exist, steps can be taken to address election-induced emotional distress in the future. To assess trends in Google search traffic over time, we collected state-level data on eight election-related terms and two mental-health-related terms (“anxiety + anxious” and “depressed + depression”) from November 2015 to present in weekly increments. We then developed two multivariate models for each state to deduce which election-related terms correlated against anxiety and depression. Multivariate models allow us to assess the individual impact of each input variable (i.e. election-related search terms in a given state) on the outcome of interest (i.e. anxiety or depression in a given state), after controlling for the others. This is particularly important when the input variables are associated with each other, which is likely true here given that the search terms used are all conceptually related. Moreover, by building models that use data collected at multiple points in time, we’re able to consider expected week-to-week fluctuations in search behavior, such as upticks in election-related Google searches during campaign trail events, for any given state. And perhaps most importantly, by modeling each state separately, we’re able to determine if trends vary across borders. Seeing Red and Feeling Blue As it turns out, the relationship between election-related Google search traffic and mental wellbeing isn’t entirely uniform across the United States. For instance, searches for “vote + voting” and “voter registration” are more likely to be correlated with depression and anxiety in swing states than in red and blue ones. Meanwhile, when compared against blue and swing states, increased searches for both “Hillary Clinton” and “Donald Trump” are more likely to be correlated with depression and anxiety in red ones. This indicates that certain brands of susceptibility to election-associated emotional distress differ across groups; though voter-related issues seem to have most influence on mental health and wellbeing among swing state voters, red state voters appear to be more vulnerable to candidate-related issues. Though some generalizations can be made across party lines, state-by-state results are considerably heterogeneous, suggesting that additional time- and space-varying factors—such as local (i.e. state) government and finances—may also be important. Furthermore, future analysis at the county- or district-level may shed further light upon these relationships, which might be particularly valuable for swing states, where political affiliations are more fragmented. Increased searches for presidential election seem to be associated with searches for depression and anxiety. However, some findings are consistent across red, blue, and swing states. Among them is the fact that increased searches explicitly for “presidential election” seem to be associated with searches for depression and anxiety, which suggests that the 2016 presidential election cycle may have been a source of emotional distress for Americans, irrespective of political leaning. Paired with existing evidence, the results from this analysis add a dimension of complexity to an already compelling argument regarding the impact of the 2016 presidential election cycle on mental health and wellness across the United States. If correlations between election-related Google search trends and mental-health related Google trends are taken as causal, our findings indicate that—though susceptibility varies across groups—the ramp-up to today’s election has likely had adverse effects on the mental health and wellbeing of American citizens. No matter your state or party, the 2016 presidential election cycle hasn’t been easy. Here’s hoping that today brings our mental health and wellness some much-needed peace. Go Back to Top.

Follow TechnoBuffalo Microsoft has announced a fix to the bug that exposed Windows users to possible attacks. Google controversially exposed the flaw and after ten days revealed it publicly. This didn’t sit well with Microsoft, but Google said hackers were actively exploiting the flaw and users deserved to be aware of the risks. The bug is now fixed so Windows users can breathe a little easier. The attack was reportedly launched by Strontium, a group that has ties with Russia, which used vulnerabilities within Adobe Flash and Windows kernel to carry out the hack into user computers. This allowed hackers to do a number of things, including installing programs and deleting data. Microsoft claims if users were to be attacked, it would automatically enable Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection, therefore the attack would be minimized. Google exposed the flaw because users were exposed Still, it was dangerous on Microsoft’s part to wait nearly three weeks to patch the bug. They weren’t too happy with Google whistleblowing the bug for everyone, including possible hackers, to know. But it looks like the news spurred Microsoft to expedite the patch. If you haven’t updated your Window’s machine with the latest security patches, you should do that as soon as possible.

Tweet  Print This   Project Wing, Alphabet Inc. The latest Google drones have just started taking flight in the real world. But the team behind the technology is slowing down, trimming headcount and shelving initiatives as the experimental unit becomes the latest target of tightening budgets across parent company Alphabet Inc. Project Wing, a unit of Alphabet's X research lab, nixed a partnership with coffee giant Starbucks Corp., according to people familiar with the decision. Following the departure of project leader Dave Vos in October, the unit also froze hiring and began asking some staff to seek jobs elsewhere in the company, according to some of those people.

Drones are in a particularly knotty place. U.S. federal regulation does not yet allow them for delivery, except in select test zones. However, Alphabet's deceleration comes as other technology companies, including Amazon.com Inc., plow money into drone delivery. "Project Wing has the potential to remove a big chunk of the friction in how physical things are moved around in the world," a spokeswoman for X wrote in an e-mail. "What we’re doing now is developing the next phase of our technology, and as always are thinking in a very broad way about all the potential use cases for delivery by unmanned aerial systems." In August, Project Wing won approval for test flights at a U.S. site, part of a White House effort to encourage unmanned vehicle delivery. Then in September, Alphabet announced a new foray: a partnership with Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. to deliver food via drone at Virginia Tech. 1 2 3 Next >> By Mark Bergen Bloomberg News Follow Transport Topics on RSS Twitter Facebook © 2016, Transport Topics, American Trucking Associations Inc.

Google to shut down Map Maker, its crowdsourced map editing tool Posted Nov 8, 2016 by Sarah Perez (@sarahintampa) 0 SHARES Next Story Alexa, who is winning the presidential election? Since 2008, Google has run an online tool called Map Maker that allows anyone worldwide to contribute data to Google Maps. Now, that tool is shutting down. The company announced today in its online forum for the project that the Google Map Maker service, as a standalone product, is retiring in March 2017. However, crowdsourced contributions to Google Maps are not ending, the company noted – instead, those will be transitioned to Google’s Local Guides program. Local Guides, to some extent, is a modernized version of the years-old Map Maker service. The older service offered an online tool and editor that let anyone submit updates to Google Maps, which moderators could then approve. The larger goal was to fill out Google Maps with road and business information in less developed regions where detailed local maps were not as readily available. However, as you may recall, Map Maker’s crowdsourced functionality also got Google into trouble in years past. For example, in 2015, Map Maker was used to vandalize Google Maps with an image of Google’s Android character urinating on the Apple logo. The company had to shut down Map Maker temporarily, following this and other spam attacks and obscene edits. Even as Map Maker was struggling to police its community, Google was developing its Local Guides program. The initiative, which began something like Google’s own version of Yelp Elites, today offers a way for volunteers to contribute to Google Maps and Google business listings, in exchange for points, rewards, as well as invites to special events and early access new features. Guides can earn points for a variety of tasks, like writing reviews, adding or editing places, posting photos, and more. Map Maker, however, offers an expanded feature set, including the ability to edit roads, for example. Its unique feature set will be merged with Local Guides in preparation for the March 2017 shutdown, as well as after Map Maker is closed. As the features become available, they’ll be posted to both product websites: Map Maker Help Forum and on LocalGuidesConnect.com. In addition, starting today, edits submitted to Google Maps will no longer be available Map Maker for moderation. This is so Google can streamline its efforts and speed up the time it takes to publish these edits, says the company. The shutdown makes sense given the overlap between the two initiatives, Map Maker and Local Guides. The shift should also cut down on the spamming and vandalism problems, thanks to the newer systems for editing and approvals. However, whether or not Google will be able to shift its full set of Map Maker editing tools to the newer platform by the time Map Maker shuts its doors still remains to be seen. Google used to announce its product shutdowns in larger batches, dubbed ‘spring cleanings.’ But this time around (and in the fall), the company has been more quietly closing up services without the fanfare. Yesterday, for instance, it shut down its move site, Google Showtimes. “Over the past year, we’ve rolled out new, easy ways for people to help keep Google Maps up to date by allowing them to make edits directly from the Google Maps app and through Google Search. Based on these efforts, in addition to our new Local Guides program, we’ve decided to retire Map Maker in order to improve and expedite the Maps editing experience on both mobile and desktop,” a Google spokesperson told TechCrunch, about the company’s decision to end Map Maker. “We greatly appreciate the millions of edits the Map Maker community has contributed over the years and encourage them to continue adding their local knowledge to Google Maps through our recently launched contribution channels and by joining the growing community of Local Guides,” they added.

Pixabay Tech 00:38 09.11.2016Get short URL 357052 Dr. Robert Epstein, former editor of Psychology Today, has published research on Sputnik News claiming that Google uses several techniques to manipulate undecided voters to favor Hillary Clinton. What other possible tricks do tech giants have up their sleeve? © Photo: Pixabay Robots Have Secrets Too: Google DeepMind AIs Create Own EncryptionGoogle search-result manipulation and, more recently, Google search autocomplete manipulation were just two techniques that Dr. Robert Epstein exposed in an earlier articles. His most recent article, written in cooperation with Benjamin Edelman, an associate professor of business administration at Harvard Business School, covers a wider variety of mechanisms that may exist. Whether they do exist is debatable, but the key idea is that there would be no way to trace or legally regulate them, if they do exist. ​For example, one such hypothetical technique could be implemented by Facebook, the world's largest social-media network. It's plausible that Facebook would send "go out and vote" reminders on election day. But what if not every US user gets this reminder? That could happen, the authors say, speculating that some voters could be conveniently left out. According to the article, it could add up to some 600,000 potential votes in favor of an opposing candidate, which is some half a percent of the US eligible-voter figure of 130 million. While one could argue that this is not a significant number, it should be noted that this technique is part of a larger scheme, also untraceable, and actually legal, under current US legislation. © Flickr/ mkhmarketing German Prosecutors Suspect Facebook Management of Hate IncitementThe estimated impact of Google's possible election-swaying techniques detailed in the earlier article is larger: Epstein and Edelman believe Google can shift up to 3.2 million votes by using autocomplete feature manipulation, and up to 10.4 million votes using a search results arrangement manipulation technique. All of these potential machinations are legal and cannot be controlled, let alone detected, unless strict regulations are imposed on tech companies, which is unlikely, due to those companies' close ties to the halls of power. If speculation about possible manipulation techniques might smack of paranoia, it is much harder to deny the fact that Silicon Valley favors Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton overwhelmingly, over the Republican candidate Donald Trump. It is known that donations from the tech sector to the Democrats exceed those to the GOP some 25 to 1. © REUTERS/ Carlos Barria Podesta on Hillary Clinton Campaign Strategy: 'No Idea How to Lift Her Up'The article also mentions that chief technology officers for both incumbent US President Barack Obama and Clinton are former Google employees. Google employees visited the White House over 420 times in the past eight years, as noted in an extensive investigative article by The Intercept that also points out, among other things, that some 250 people swapped their employment from Google to the White House, and vice versa. And thanks to WikiLeaks and the Podesta emails, we now know for sure that Eric Schmidt, the chairman of Google's parent company Alphabet, worked closely with the Clinton campaign. Both Epstein and Edelman support Clinton, but regard freedom of information to be more important than the success of their preferred candidate. "What if, next time, Google and Facebook support a candidate who serves their needs more than the needs of society at large?" the authors ask. There are two larger problems, apart from voter manipulation. First, as mentioned above, online techniques, including modifying matching algorithms for Tinder's Swipe-the-Vote online service, are not fraud, and a work must be done where legislation meets tech. It's Wild West for the tech giants right now. © AP Photo/ Darko Vojinovic Private Information of 550,000 Australian Blood Donors LeakedThose techniques are mostly invisible to the user, especially since most people believe that search engines simply report impartial and neutral information. It could be seen as working now, but that might change, with deep, long-term repercussions. Should the big lie behind this concept be exposed, people will lose faith in freedom of information in the internet. The impact of such a realization will reshape the market of information, as even the most fair of services will have a tough time convincing the customer that they are who they say they are. It's hard to tell how future presidential candidates (or other interested persons) will convince people who have lost faith in free, unbiased information. Will campaigns of the future become a reality TV show of cursing polemic and absurdity? That's one bleak version. ...

Comments By Gregg Keizer Follow Computerworld | Nov 8, 2016 1:02 PM PT RELATED TOPICS Windows PCs Security Microsoft Comments Microsoft today patched a Windows vulnerability that was disclosed just over a week ago by researchers from Alphabet Inc.'s Google. In one of several security updates -- 14 to be exact -- Microsoft fixed the bug in the Windows kernel drivers that Google security engineers had revealed on Oct. 31, 10 days after notifying Microsoft of the vulnerability. Microsoft credited Neel Mehta and Billy Leonard of Google's Threat Analysis Group for reporting the flaw. Last week, the two said that because the vulnerability was being actively exploited, a disclose-within-seven-days policy applied. Microsoft's top Windows executive, Terry Myerson, castigated Google for the move. "Google's decision to disclose these vulnerabilities before patches are broadly available and tested is disappointing, and puts customers at increased risk," Myerson wrote in a Nov. 1 post. Myerson claimed that the attacks in circulation were being conducted by a Russian group that previously was linked to a hack of the Democratic National Committee (DNC). The gang, which Microsoft dubbed Strontium, has been responsible since at least 2007 for very targeted attacks against governments, militaries and diplomats around the globe. Also last week, Microsoft asserted that, while the latest Windows 10 upgrade -- the summer's Anniversary Update -- contained the flaw, an anti-exploit defense had been added to that edition prior to the attacks coming to light. "These Windows 10 Anniversary Update mitigations, which were developed based on proactive internal research, stop all observed in-the-wild instances of this exploit," Myerson said. Today, Microsoft patched the kernel drivers bug in Windows 10, as well as in Vista, Windows 7 and Windows 8.1.

Mello Jr. Nov 8, 2016 12:56 PM PT Google's Pixel smartphone, which made its debut last month, has gathered some high praise from reviewers. "The Google Pixel is now the best Android smartphone you can buy," wrote Joanna Stern in The Wall Street Journal. "The other leading contender was disqualified due to spontaneous combustion," she added, referring to Samsung's doomed Galaxy Note7, which was recalled for safety reasons. Stern was impressed with Pixel's display; its high pixel count made the blacks in photos appear deeper, colors more vibrant, and everything sharper. "The AMOLED display makes photos look better -- even ones taken on an iPhone," she wrote. Keep Your Pixels Dry Pixel "offers the look and competence of an iPhone with a truly great camera and loads of innovative software and services," David Pierce noted in a review for Wired. "It changes my answer to the question I hear most often: 'What phone should you get?' You should get a Pixel," he wrote. "The immediate joke everyone, including me, made on Twitter after the Pixel launch was that Google made an iPhone," Pierce added. "Well, that's true. As it turns out, an iPhone running Android is exactly what I've been waiting for." Pixel is a standout compared to other heavyweights in the market, according to Lisa Eadicicco, who reviewed it for Time. "All told, the Pixel is Google's first smartphone that can go toe-to-toe with Apple's iPhone and Samsung's Galaxy flagship," she wrote. "It's on equal footing with those phones in most of the areas that really matter, although its lack of water resistance is a setback. Still, Android fans who pick up the Pixel should be pleased, so long as they keep it dry." Smooth Performance Google hit a home run with its first branded smartphone, said Cnet reviewer Lynn La. "With Pixel, Google stepped up to bat, called its shot and knocked it out of the park," she wrote. It's a departure from Google's earlier Nexus smartphones, because you don't have to be an Android enthusiast to appreciate what Google has accomplished with the Pixel. "The only thing you'll have to be enthusiastic about is owning a phone that's beautiful, takes awesome photos, and has smooth performance," La wrote. "If you are, the Pixel's for you." The Pixel's performance was won kudos from Jason Cross, writing for PC World. "Android fans often complain about phones (especially Samsung's) that lead benchmark charts, but still somehow seem to stutter, chop, and sputter when you use them," he explained. "The Pixel XL does none of that," he wrote. "At every turn it is smooth, fast, and most of all, responsive." "Indeed, this may be the smoothest and most responsive Android phone I've ever used," he added. Rain on Pixel's Parade Some reviewers were unimpressed by Google's smartphone offering. "The absence of a major competing Android device works out especially well for Google because the Pixel is, relatively speaking, mediocre," Brian X. Chen wrote for The New York Times. "It is slower than Apple's iPhone 7 and the Galaxy S7, Samsung's smaller flagship phone," he noted. "Photos shot with Pixel's camera don't look as good as the iPhone's," Chen continued. "And Google's built-in artificially intelligent virtual assistant, called Assistant, is still fairly dumb." Pricing may be an issue with the Pixel models, noted David McQueen, research director for consumer devices and strategic technology at ABI Research. The Pixel is priced at US$650 and the larger Pixel XL is selling for $770. "This is quite expensive for what you're getting, and the build quality isn't as good as other flagship phones in the market," McQueen told TechNewsWorld. "It's going to be a bit problematic for Google to create differentiation for the hardware at that price point." Google's Hardware Future However, baking Google Assistant into Pixel's hardware could do that, McQueen continued. "Since it's the first device to carry Google Assistant, that will be a differentiator in an Android market where it's very difficult to make any sort of differentiation on the hardware," he said. Indeed, Google Assistant may not only be Pixel's prime asset, but also a key component of Google's hardware future. "The Pixel's greatest strength is really not anything in the hardware side," said Mark Hung, a research vice president at Gartner. It's Google Assistant, which is only available on Pixel, he pointed out. "It's the future of not only Pixel, but of the Google hardware ecosystem," Hung told TechNewsWorld. "Google is looking to make artificial intelligence the next platform after mobile and social." Gunning for Apple Reviewers taking the measure of Pixel never failed to mention the iPhone. There's a simple reason for that. "They're going after iPhone customers and other high-end phone buyers," said Ross Rubin, principal analyst at Reticle Research. It may be difficult for Pixel to make headway in that target market, though. "In developed markets, we're seeing a lot of saturation," Rubin noted. "It's a pretty late time to be a newcomer to the space, even if you have all the advantages that Google has." iPhone users were Pixel's target market, but the product also will benefit from the recall of the Samsung Note7, pbserved Kevin Krewell, a principal analyst at Tirias Research. "The Pixel will be the major alternative to the Note7," he told TechNewsWorld, "even though it lacks the Samsung product's stylus and wider carrier distribution."

On election day, many are hoping that this approach can give us insight into what in the world is happening at the polls — and thankfully the folks over at Google Trends have stepped up to provide us with election-focused data across the US and right here in California. While the general Google search trends are perhaps unsurprising (at the time of this writing, Prince Harry's girlfriend, Meghan Markle, is the top-searched topic in the US), when the data is narrowed down to election-specific queries we gain a pretty fascinating insight into what is happening across our great state. Google focused on five specific topics: long wait times, provisional ballots, inactive voter status, voter intimidation, and voting machine problems. As the below embedded tool shows, these issues are very much on voters' minds. "The goal of Electionland is to cover access to the ballot and problems that prevent people from exercising their right to vote," Google wrote of their project. "By exploring with us on Tuesday, you’ll be part of an experiment to see if data can can shed light on some of the biggest issues on the biggest day in the election cycle." And while this information straight from the horse's mouth is fascinating, USA Today did their own little bit of data gathering to bring us the following factoid: Many people across our great union just want to know "who is Taylor Swift voting for?" Ah, the big questions in life.

(Reuters/Bria Webb) (The Washington Post) - The long national nightmare of the 2016 campaign is finally coming to a close. There’s been a lot of talk about the potentially irreparable damage this acrimonious contest has done to our civic fabric. But if there’s any silver lining to the campaign, it may be that all the outlandish and divisive rhetoric is serving to get more people engaged with the political process. Here’s one datapoint that speaks to our current level of civic engagement, from Google Trends: Peoples’ interest in finding out where to vote has never been higher. The Google data show that searches for “where to vote” account for about twice as much Google search volume this November as they have in previous presidential election years in 2004, 2008 and 2012. Broader search queries, like “voting,” show a similar pattern — though those searches could be related to other information like early vote tallies, or to non-election voting for things like [voting for contestants on reality] shows. A person wanting to know “where to vote,” on the other hand, is probably looking for specific, practical information on where to cast a ballot. The related queries that Google shows for this search bolster that assumption — they include queries on how to register, how to vote, and voter eligibility. Other signs point to higher-than-normal voter turnout in 2016. More than 47 million voters have cast early ballots this year, smashing the previous early voting record of 32 million in 2012. Some of that increase is due to simple population growth, and some of it comes from more states adding early and no-excuse absentee voting this year. Early voting also indicates that Latino participation may hit record levels this year. This is likely to be a boon for Hillary Clinton, given Trump’s record-low support among Latino voters. Political betting markets have also recently taken a turn toward predicting higher turnout. At PredictIt, the odds for a turnout of 145 million voters — or more than roughly 63 percent turnout — have spiked in recent days. A number of that magnitude could be higher than the turnout in any election since the 1960s. High turnout could be favorable for the Clinton campaign. “Most often, higher turnout favors Democrats,” political scientist Michael P. McDonald told Factcheck.org earlier this year. This is because demographic groups that historically have low turnout rates — minorities and young people chief among them — tend to prefer Democratic candidates.

That depends… Should you run a Black Friday press release? That depends… Posted on November 8, 2016 by Brian in Press Releases Conceptual image of a businessman holding big hammer Black Friday is one of the biggest shopping days of the year. It falls the day after Thanksgiving (November 25th this year) and often features great deals on products and services. The question for marketers and publicists is whether it makes sense to run a press release for your business for Black Friday. We will try to answer that. First, if it makes sense to have a Black Friday sale for your business, then absolutely have one. Your customers will likely appreciate it (and may expect it). But as far as a press release goes, you have to remember that a lot of the benefit of an online press release for a small and medium sized business is the Google News/Google boost you get based on targeted keywords in your headline. If your main keywords are ‘Black Friday” and some other general words, the competition in Google News/Google will be so extreme from major media and major retailers that there is almost no way your press release will get much attention. Look at the number of stories even today (https://www.google.com/#q=black+friday&safe=off&tbm=nws) The one caveat might be if you have a very specific niche, that when combined with ‘Black Friday’, might actually get some attention. A ‘long tail’ play on Black Friday. For example, painters in a smaller city could run a press release headline such as “San Rafael painters Contigo Brothers offer Black Friday deals”. You might actually rank ok for niche searches for “San Rafael painters Black Friday”. Or, substitute ‘painters’ for other services (massage, manicure, haircut, steakhouse, hotel, plumbing, roofing, etc). Whatever your product or service, make sure it has enough long tail keywords in the headline to be uniquely non-competitive. You are never going to get many views for your press release for Black Friday deals on Flat Screen TVS, unless you are Target/Best Buy/Walmart/Amazon. You get the idea. PS: The same goes for other major events on specific dates (Cyber Monday, Superbowl, Xmas, Back To School, etc). Unless you are going with long tail keywords in a specific niche, the competition in Google is just too extreme to get much attention for your press release. In general, probably the best way to promote your business around Black Friday and similar events is by a direct email deal to your customer email list.

These pinpoints are color-coded by search phrases such as “Long Wait Times,” “Provisional Ballots,” “Voter Intimidation,” and “Voting Machine Problems." Although “Inactive Voter Status” was the most searched phrase as of mid-afternoon Tuesday, “Voter Intimidation” had an 11 percent increase in search volume in the morning, around 7:45 a.m. By 10 a.m., “Voting Machine Problems” had a 35 percent increase in searches, and by noon this search had reached a 93 percent increase. In more rural areas of Pennsylvania, search phrases experienced different trends. In Brighton, a township of 8,000 people in the western part of the state, “Voter Intimidation” experienced a 201 percent increase. Meanwhile, State College experienced an increased search volume for “Provisional Ballots.” All comments eligible for publication in The Daily Pennsylvanian.

Uber wants to move people around with flying taxis, and Airbus is committed to producing this kind of vehicle. Meanwhile Google and Amazon are hoping to deliver packages with much smaller drones. All see the potential for fleets of unmanned aerial vehicles that can pilot themselves. But to make that vision a reality, we're going to need a new breed of sense and avoid technology. Echodyne, a Bellevue, Washington-based startup, believes it has the answer. The company announced preliminary test results from field trials of its MESA-DAA radar system today. It says the device, which is barely larger than smartphone, is capable of detecting even small aircraft at a distance 1.8 miles in varying weather conditions. The company says this breakthrough is driven by the use of metamaterials, which allow the radar to eliminate moving parts, making the hardware smaller and more battery efficient without sacrificing range. A lot of modern automobiles are now equipped with radar systems, in fact Tesla recently announced that it would be focusing on radar as the core technology in its autonomous driving system. But even long-range automotive radar from the likes of Bosch and Delphi only claim a range of a few hundred meters. They also don't typically have a very wide field of view. Echodyne's technology claims to be able to have a 120 degree field of view in azimuth (horizontal) and 80 degrees in elevation (vertical). Founder and CEO Eben Frankenberg also says his tech was designed to track a Cessna-sized object, which is much smaller than a car in radar cross section. "To make a drone delivery fleet a reality, you need two things," Fankenberg told The Verge. "You need units that can operate beyond a pilot's line of sight and you need a single operator for multiple aircraft." Right now both those activities are illegal in the US. NASA and the FAA are still in the preliminary phases of designing and testing a next-generation air traffic control system that would allow for those kinds of operations. But Echodyne's technology is exactly the sort of breakthrough the industry needs to make these missions possible. The company says it hopes to follow up today's field test results with a commercial offering of this new radar technology in the first quarter of 2017. Echodyne's new radar next to a standard smartphone.

"I am afraid our policies do not allow us to comment on campus/hiring outreach program," a spokesperson said by email. NEW DELHI: When the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) start campus recruitments in a few weeks, Google will only attend those at Delhi and Bombay and give the rest a miss for the first time in about a decade. Not because it doesn't want to hire graduates from the others but the company is confident that its reputation as one of the world's top technology companies will be enough to draw applicants from India's premier engineering schools. The move by Google to bypass the placement process at IITs in Kharagpur, Kanpur, Chennai, Guwahati and elsewhere clearly marks a break with tradition. It will directly hire any candidates it finds worthy without involving the schools. Such off-campus hiring is discouraged by the IITs but they didn't have much of an option when it came to Google, except for Delhi and Bombay. "There was an internal decision taken by the company to go the off-campus route. Most of the IITs agreed to this. But Delhi and Bombay have different processes in place," said an IIT Delhi official. An IIT Bombay official said, "We do not encourage off-campus placements." The schools aren't too keen on companies hiring directly because it disrupts the process for everyone else. "Students cannot sail on two boats during placements," said the IIT Delhi official cited above. People associated with IIT placement committees confirmed that Google had sought to be excluded from the campus placement process. Google declined to comment. "I am afraid our policies do not allow us to comment on campus/hiring outreach program," a spokesperson said by email. The company has already started approaching students directly and vice versa, said placement committee insiders at various IITs. McKinsey kicked off the trend last year by going completely off campus for its IIT recruitments during final placements. The management consultant hired about 10 IIT Delhi graduates through its alumni network, website and social media. Google's salaries offers are among the highest — upwards of Rs 1-2 crore for international postings. And as befits its stature, the company has a rigorous hiring process. Last year, it hired about 20 candidates from the five older IITs (Delhi, Bombay, Kharagpur, Kanpur and Madras).

(Image: Screenshot/Google) Prime Minister Narendra Modi took India and the world by surprise when he announced scrapping of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes in a late night announcement. This, according to the Prime Minister, is being done to combat black money, corruption and terror-financing. Such was the impact of the dramatic announcement that global interest in the related search terms showed a steep spike and keywords such "Narendra Modi" and "Indian rupee" ranked higher than the US presidential elections on Google search trends even in the US. This is notable as it is Election Day in the US, when the country votes for its new president in the culmination of a long and contentious campaign that has captivated the interest of a global audience. However as the election day proceeded in the US, the interest in the Indian government's tactical move showed a dip. The surprise move by the Modi government was designed to bring in unaccounted wealth into the mainstream economy, as well as hit the finances of terrorists who target India and are suspected of using fake high denomination notes to fund operations. Nearly 40 per cent of India's economy is driven by small- and medium-sized enterprises that largely run on cash transactions. Economists fear the move could impact these businesses, and in turn have a knock-on effect on economic growth.

The Tokyo region doubles its Asian presence to two regions and six zones, and Google’s ambitious expansion plans include new Asia-Pacific regions slated for Mumbai, Singapore, and Sydney in the next year, and additional new regions in the U.S., Finland, Germany, UK, and Brazil. Google now offers six regions and 18 availability zones, and is scheduled to reach 14 regions and around 40 zones by the end of next year. AWS and Azure are both offered from more regions, and are also planning to launch new points of presence, but the new regions will reduce the difference. READ MORE: Report: AWS Has Twice the Market Share of Microsoft, Google and IBM Combined “Low latency and high performance are key considerations when choosing a region to deploy resources,” wrote Google Cloud Platform product managers Varun Sakalkar and Dave Stiver in a blog post. “By opening a dedicated cloud region in Tokyo, we’re bringing Google’s compute, storage and networking services directly to Japanese businesses. Based on our testing, customers in cities like Tokyo, Osaka, Sapporo and Nagoya experience 50-85 percent lower latency on average when served from the Tokyo region compared to Taiwan.” Google Compute Engine, Cloud Storage, Cloud Persistent Disk, App Engine standard environment, and Container Engine are now available from the Tokyo region, as well as all core networking and security services and some database and analytics services. Google is running Intel Broadwell processors in the region, and has partnered with several companies in Japan to help onboard customers. Google upgraded GCP’s database services for enterprise customers in August. Google has also recently invested in a pair of submarine cables, FASTER and PLCN, as it attempts to scale its network to compete with Amazon and Microsoft.

How the 'worried well' are making themselves sick The researchers believe obsessively monitoring our symptoms could be doing more harm than good. Tweet Facebook of ╳ exit This is why you need to dump Doctor Google. Worrying about your symptoms could make you sick. Health-related anxiety potentially increases your odds of a heart attack or angina by about 70 per cent, according to a European study published in the British medical journal BMJ Open today. From a study of more than 7000 people, 6 per cent of those who needlessly stressed about getting sick, known as "the worried well," went on to develop ischemic heart disease within 10 years compared with 3 per cent of their carefree counterparts. When the researchers adjusted out known risk factors for heart disease such as smoking and lack of exercise, the worried well had an even larger increased risk compared with the unworried. And the more intense a person's fear of getting sick was, the greater their chances of developing heart illness became. "If persons with high levels of health anxiety stay alert with the intention to better 'control' and 'detect' early signs of severe somatic diseases, it might contribute to unintentional harmful effects as the autonomous activation associated with anxiety in general likely is associated with increased risk of IHD," the author's wrote. "At best, this finding might encourage patients to seek treatment for health anxiety and to trust their heart." Their research used the Hordaland Health Study (HUSK), which followed 7052 Norwegians for 12 years from 1997, and the Cardiovascular Diseases in Norway Project, which collected data on heart disease deaths and hospitalisations from 1994-2009. People were ranked on their health anxiety levels using the Whitely test, which requires participants to give a score of 1 to 5 on how much they relate to each of 14 statements. Questions include  "Do you think there is something seriously wrong with your body?" and "If you feel ill and someone tells you that you are looking better, do you become annoyed?" An overall score of more than 31 out of a possible 55 meant a participant had health anxiety. The researchers – led by Dr Line Iden Berge, from the Sandviken University Hospital in Bergen, Norway – also found the worried well said they exercised less often and were more likely to smoke. They wrote that no firm conclusions about cause and effect could be drawn from their study and warned that health anxiety often sat alongside other mental health issues. Cardiologist David Colquhoun, chair of the clinical council of the Cardiac Society of Australia and New Zealand, said there were known psycho-social risk factors that were as important at predicting heart attack as cholesterol and blood pressure levels. He was part of a Heart Foundation expert committee that found depression and social isolation were independent predictors of heart attack; and said many people who experienced depression often also had anxiety. "It may be that if you're obsessively worried about your health this is a marker of you being anxious about other things and this confirms previous data that it increases your personal risk of having a heart attack," Professor Colquhoun said. "Perceived stress, whether its marital, work or financial, is a powerful predictor of heart attack." Extreme anxiety could cause a heart attack because the body was flooded with adrenaline, which drives the heart rate up and can cause a blood clot in the artery. "Being constantly on alert appears to stimulate growth of the cholesterol plaque in the artery and then severe stress can trigger rupturing of the plaque," he said. Professor Colquhoun said people with high risk factors like a family history of heart attack should be keeping an eye on their symptoms, and worry is quite rational in some circumstances. Hypochondriasis, also called hypochondria, which describes abnormal chronic anxiety about one's health, was dropped from the latest edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. It was replaced with two new conditions: somatic symptom disorder – which refers to patients with one or more chronic bodily symptom about which they were excessively concerned; and illness anxiety disorder. Illness anxiety relates to patients who may or may not have a medical condition, have heightened bodily sensations and are anxious about the possibility of unknown illness, which they may obsessively research. Psychiatrist Steve Ellen, the director of psychosocial oncology at the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre in Melbourne, said once identified, health anxiety was very treatable but many people who experience it don't seek help from mental health practitioners. "The patients who believe they've got something wrong with them, who are phobic about illnesses, they don't come to shrinks, they go to physical doctors to get tests," he said. Associate Professor Ellen said every day the average person has about a dozen physical symptoms that are mostly dismissed. "But if you're phobic or anxious about your health you'll over interpret those symptoms," he said. Heart disease remains the leading cause of death in Australia, accounting for 19,777 deaths in 2015.

By Conner Forrest | November 8, 2016, 10:21 AM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus Image: Jason Hiner/TechRepublic Google's senior vice president for technical infrastructure, Urs Hölzle, spoke at the Structure Conference in San Francisco on Tuesday about the future of Google's cloud strategy, and why he thinks that customers shouldn't have to care about their cloud infrastructure. There are a surprising number of Google Cloud customers who have large scale computations where infrastructure is increasingly important, Hölzle said.Things like big data are becoming relevant for almost every industry, which has implications for infrastructure as the scale of data continues to increase. However, despite the increased pressure that these new technologies place on infrastructure, customers shouldn't have to care about that infrastructure, he said. It should be on the cloud provider to take care of that, so the end user doesn't have to even consider it when they begin new projects. SEE: Cloud computing policy template (Tech Pro Research) "You shouldn't have to worry about this...you shouldn't care about this," Hölzle said. In the ideal situation, Hölzle said, the customer wouldn't need to even think about picking the machine type for their cloud strategy. It is something that Google should determine for the customer—Hölzle called it "infrastructure getting out of the way." Must-Read Cloud Why there's no compelling use case for hybrid cloud Pokemon Go: How the cloud saved the smash hit game from collapse Switching clouds: What Spotify learned when it swapped AWS for Google's cloud Tech Pro Research: Cloud computing policy He hopes that, five years from now, only 1% of customer companies know what a machine type is, and 99% feel like they have never had to think about it. The reason being is that the cloud, if effective, should be something that exists almost wholly in the background if it is to properly empower new innovations. According to Hölzle, most on-premises workloads aren't fully optimized. Moore's law is slowing down, so users may no longer be able to get the same upgrade of power over the same amount of time. This obviously affects hardware, and will likely affect how efficient an on-premises deployment can be. When a new technology comes around, like Google's TensorFlow Hölzle said, the customer doesn't have to do anything on their end to leverage that technology, if they're using public cloud. That, he said, is the huge upside of using the cloud. "In the cloud, it's much easier to insert new technology," Hölzle said. This also includes technologies such as AI and machine learning, which Google has been using for many years, Hölzle said. However, this is contingent, to some degree, on the bottleneck of Flash storage, which Hölzle said is outdated. The 3 big takeaways for TechRepublic readers Google's cloud honcho Urs Hölzle said that, if implemented correctly, cloud customers shouldn't have to think or care about the cloud infrastructure they utilize. In five years, Hölzle said he hopes that only 1% of his customers know what a machine type is, as he feels that Google should be the one determining what is best for their customers. The cloud also facilitates new technology implementation, he said, as the provider is able to deploy new tech without much work on the customer's end.

(Photo by Chris Granger, Nola.com | The Times-Picayune) (CHRIS GRANGER) By  The Washington Post The Times-Picayune Follow on Twitter on November 08, 2016 at 1:25 PM Print Email The long national nightmare of the 2016 campaign is finally coming to a close. There's been a lot of talk about the potentially irreparable damage this acrimonious contest has done to our civic fabric. But if there's any silver lining to the campaign, it may be that all the outlandish and divisive rhetoric is serving to get more people engaged with the political process. Here's one datapoint that speaks to our current level of civic engagement, from Google Trends: Peoples' interest in finding out where to vote has never been higher. The Google data show that searches for "where to vote" account for about twice as much Google search volume this November as they have in previous presidential election years in 2004, 2008 and 2012. Broader search queries, like "voting," show a similar pattern -- though those searches could be related to other information like early vote tallies, or to non-election voting for things like TV shows (America's Got Talent, etc.). A person wanting to know "where to vote," on the other hand, is probably looking for specific, practical information on where to cast a ballot. The related queries that Google shows for this search bolster that assumption -- they include queries on how to register, how to vote, and voter eligibility. Other signs point to higher-than-normal voter turnout in 2016. More than 47 million voters have cast early ballots this year, smashing the previous early voting record of 32 million in 2012. Some of that increase is due to simple population growth, and some of it comes from more states adding early and no-excuse absentee voting this year. Early voting also indicates that Latino participation may hit record levels this year. This is likely to be a boon for Hillary Clinton, given Trump's record-low support among Latino voters. Political betting markets have also recently taken a turn toward predicting higher turnout. At PredictIt, the odds for a turnout of 145 million voters -- or more than roughly 63 percent turnout -- have spiked in recent days. A number of that magnitude could be higher than the turnout in any election since the 1960s. High turnout could be favorable for the Clinton campaign. "Most often, higher turnout favors Democrats," political scientist Michael P. McDonald told Factcheck.org earlier this year. This is because demographic groups that historically have low turnout rates -- minorities and young people chief among them -- tend to prefer Democratic candidates. © The Washington Post, by Christopher Ingraham About Us About NOLA.com About NOLA Media Group Community Rules Content Partners Advertise with us Frequently Asked Questions Contact Us Connect with the Newsroom Blog for Us Careers Submit a Correction The Times-Picayune Subscribe TP electronic edition eNewsletters Breaking news text alerts Report a wet or missing paper Make a payment, manage your account RSS Times-Picayune Store Legal notices NOLA.com Sections News Sports Entertainment Opinion Obituaries Jobs Autos Real Estate Rentals Classifieds Local Deals Local Businesses Your Regional News Pages New Orleans St. Bernard East Jefferson West Bank Northshore/St. Tammany Plaquemines River Parishes Baton Rouge Mobile Mobile Apps | Mobile FAQ More on NOLA.com Videos Weather Webcams/Live!

Today that case arrived at my doorstep, and it being my first Live Case — I didn’t grab one for the Nexus 6P/5X — I thought I’d share a few thoughts… First of all, I have to touch on the My Live Case app that goes with the case. After you take the case out of the box, it asks you to unlock your phone and tap and hold the shortcut button on the back. This pulls up the My Live Case Play Store listing, and after you have it up and running, it sets your wallpaper to match your Live Case. Along with that, the app lets you customize and add a blur to your wallpaper, and — of course — choose what exactly that shortcut button on the back does. By default — at least with the Places case; I can’t speak for the others — the Live Case is set to pull up places around you when you tap and hold the shortcut button. You can also set it to open the camera, turn on and off WiFi, launch an app, toggle the flashlight, or disable it completely. I went with flashlight. As for the button itself, well, I’m underwhelmed. I’ve heard from people who have the Nexus 6P Live Case that they don’t really use the shortcut button, and now I understand why. It’s in an awkward place — especially compared to the comfortable position of the fingerprint sensor — and it’s hard to press. You kind of have to stretch to reach it with your finger, and then you have to press it really hard and hold it down for it to trigger. On top of that, it doesn’t work unless the phone is unlocked. In short, I think the shortcut button is going to prove mostly useless for me. That’s disappointing. As for the design of this Places Live Case, I’m pretty happy. It’s pretty cool that you can just drag around a Google Maps map and pick location you want to slap on the back (in this case, I chose a generic centralized map of my town in Texas). You get a variety of colors to pick from to theme this case, and I went with this darker green and blue combo in an attempt to match the black Pixel XL. It’s just cool. I’m not sure if it’s $40 cool, but it will almost certainly have people asking about it. In terms of build quality and protection, though, the case you’re getting isn’t much different than a plastic case you could find on Amazon for $10 or less. It feels like a pretty average-quality plastic, and there’s no protection on the top and bottom. It’s definitely thick enough to perhaps save your phone from some bumps and bruises, but I don’t want to drop the phone any more with the case on it because of how much this case costs. Beating up the case would kill the good/unique looks. Overall, I’m pretty on the fence about recommending this case. If you want to build a custom case for your Pixel or Pixel XL, grabbing a Photos or Places Live Case is almost certainly the way to go (although there’s not really any way to escape the $40 price tag). But if you’re willing to settle for a case that’s perhaps a bit more bulky and comes in some more generic designs, you can probably save about $20 going with a case from a company like Spigen. Or if you want customization without the protection, maybe a skin from the likes of dbrand would do you well. If you think the Live Case is going to change how you use your phone because of its NFC button, I’m sad to report that you’re probably wrong. But if you don’t mind shelling out $40 for a case and you desperately want a fully-customized look for your Pixel, go for it. What you see is what you get.   Guides Google Pixel View THe Guide live case View THe Guide blog comments powered by Disqus Submit a Tip cancel Submitting a tip constitutes permission to publish and syndicate.

BUSINESS Technology The world's best gamers may one day compete against the smartest computers Paresh DaveContact Reporter Google cut power usage in its data centers by several percentage points earlier this year by trusting artificially intelligent software originally designed to beat 1980s-era Atari video games. And in the years to come, the Internet giant not only could save much more electricity, but also solve far larger problems by taking on a much more complex video game. Research scientists at Google’s DeepMind unit announced Friday they are developing a computer program that reads data about Blizzard Entertainment’s “StarCraft II” games and learns how to play on its own. The software would have to figure out how to split its attention between micromanagement and long-term strategic decisions. It’s that maneuvering that could deliver big breakthroughs. DeepMind sees endless possibilities to apply development lessons to programs in the energy, healthcare and technology sectors. The Irvine video game company imagines voice-synthesized broadcasters, coaching bots and virtual players that are tailored in strength to their human counterpart. Games could become more intricate and personalized. Along the way, e-sports battles could reach a new level with machine vs. human and machine vs. machine competitions. “I can’t wait to see the day where Google’s AI or someone else’s is playing with the best ‘StarCraft’ players in an e-sports arena,” said Gio Hunt, Blizzard’s executive vice president for corporate operations. “You could absolutely see a world with Google’s AI vs. Facebook’s AI vs. IBM’s AI.” BlizzCon goes all-in on e-sports Jeff Landa Part game conference and part sporting event, the two-day BlizzCon gathering at the Anaheim Convention Center reaffirmed team South Korea as the nation to beat in e-sports, no matter how new the video game. The country trounced every other national team to claim the first ever World Cup championship... Part game conference and part sporting event, the two-day BlizzCon gathering at the Anaheim Convention Center reaffirmed team South Korea as the nation to beat in e-sports, no matter how new the video game. The country trounced every other national team to claim the first ever World Cup championship... (Jeff Landa) Video games and artificial intelligence have long gone together. But the computer opponents in video games stick to a script. They look for certain triggers and respond based on written commands. The new wave of AI that Google, Amazon, Apple, Facebook and many others are pursuing rely on rule-less programs that analyze troves of data to discover the most appropriate response on its own. In the case of video games, it’s similar to how a beginning player would watch tutorial videos on YouTube and study how others play. They also do a ton of practice themselves. Over time, they pick up on what the best tactics are in a given scenario. Looking at a wide spectrum of matches, the computer can determine whether a specific move at a given point increased the chances of winning. “You have an agent and an environment,” DeepMind research scientist Oriol Vinyals said. “The agent observes and acts upon it. There’s several ways to act on an environment, and the agent has to do what’s best.” With 49 Atari games, DeepMind fed data to the computer about what was on the screen during play, including the score. Whether thrown into a boxing ring or a car racing course, the machine took over from there. It usually got close to or exceeded human scores. But Atari games are regarded as simple, with few levers and buttons to control. “StarCraft II” promises to advance the way the programs learn for several reasons. Players in the sci-fi strategy game can’t see the entire playing surface, meaning bots that play the game will function more like the ones that play poker and less like those that have conquered Go and chess. Users have to guess or spy on what their opponents are doing. It’s messy, like typical scenarios in reality. DeepMind wants to limit the AI to what humans would encounter in another way too. The game isn’t as simple as moving pieces around a board. Players must mine resources, deploy soldiers and launch attacks — and the order in which they act matters. The delicate balancing act is something computers don’t do well yet, and DeepMind isn’t going to let its software issue commands any faster than a human could. The intention is to generate new ideas about how to develop the training programs for computers and help them measure the value of different options. For example, in the data centers, Google’s systems might not know what caused a huge power spike — but they can take some guesses and act accordingly. The NFL of e-sports? Blizzard wants to create 'Overwatch' league with city-specific video game fans Paresh Dave Blizzard Entertainment pioneered e-sports with its “Starcraft” franchise more than a decade ago.  Now, with “Overwatch,” the Irvine video game maker wants to bring to e-sports the wealth and recognition that sports such as soccer, football and basketball generate.

Blizzard Entertainment pioneered e-sports with its “Starcraft” franchise more than a decade ago.  Now, with “Overwatch,” the Irvine video game maker wants to bring to e-sports the wealth and recognition that sports such as soccer, football and basketball generate. To do so, Blizzard Entertainment,... (Paresh Dave) “Ideally, it will translate to a better cooling system,” Vinyals said, noting that power usage control is just one of endless possibilities to bring lessons out of virtual reality. Though DeepMind is spearheading the initial effort on “StarCraft II,” Blizzard Entertainment plans to enable anyone to tap into its systems for similar AI research starting early next year. The public should be able to access replays of online matches as well as the data and inputs needed for bots to compete in games. Blizzard executives said the company is just scratching the surface in terms of making use of its petabytes of data. It’s now in the hunt for someone to be the “database and analytics expert for the company,” according to a job posting. Sigaty noted for example how his team has discussed making statistics from “StarCraft II” matches publicly available for other companies to use in their apps. But it hasn’t made a call on whether to do so. Working with DeepMind is the bridge, he said, to start understanding how machine analysis can make its data “even more impactful.” Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss Trump names Priebus and Bannon as top aides, California National Guard interpreters say they're owed bonuses, UC and Cal State are considering their first tuition hikes in 6 years, and L.A.

Digital Election Results Live Chris Burns - Nov 8, 2016 2 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Welcome to the year 2016 and November 8th, the day where the United States votes for their next President. In this futuristic time, we’re able to watch some results of the election as they happen. Aside from the inevitable recounts in some close-race regions, today we’re running down the best ways in which you can watch the election unfold over the next day-or-so. To be clear right up front, there’s not a lot of accurate information that can be gleaned in the next 12 hours (from when this article is released). Starting this evening, there will be a mad frenzy of activity in all major news portals. Results will be reported by State Election Offices soon after polls close. Live Results straight from the source Each Election Office has its own website and phone number. Each Election Office also has its own way of reporting results on the internet – but must report results in the same way to the Federal Election Commission. Have a peek at the FEC’s State Election Offices list to find contact information for each individual office. Through these websites, everyday citizens will be able to access voting results as fast as they’re tabulated. Each district differs in the way they report, but this method will allow anyone to see results quickly. Of course doing this sort of checking will require lots of work for one individual – so there are other options. The next best thing (and quite a bit easier) Every person with a smartphone or tablet will be able to see Google’s own election tabulations in real time through the Google app. For Android users, this requires a search with Google for “Election Results” or an “OK Google, who is winning the election?” As you’ll see in the image below, Google’s display of results should be rather easy to navigate. One of the most accurate predictors of Presidential Elections here in the United States over the past couple of elections. Founded in 2008, this aggregation of polls and past election predictors correctly predicted the 2012 presidential election in all 50 states. Their FiveThirtyEight live blog is packed full of interesting information about the election as it unfolds. How do I report voter fraud or voter intimidation? Voter intimidation and to a much lesser extent voter fraud may become an issue this year. The first thing any individual should do if they see or record voter fraud is to contact their state’s main election office (list link found above.) Witnesses can also contact the Voting Section of the Civil Rights Section of the United States Department of Justice. If any individual witnesses voter intimidation, they should file a complaint with the Voting Section of the Civil Rights Section of the United States Department of Justice (as linked immediately above). Voter intimidation can also be reported to this department by calling 1-800-253-3931 or by emailing voting.section@usdoj.gov as quick as possible. How late are the polls open? Below you’ll find an interactive map prepared by the United States Election Assistance Commission. This map shows all 50 states, each click or tap-friendly. Each tap shows links for Election Day Workers and 2016 Voting Information for each state. Below you’ll also find a map which shows what time polls close in each state. Note that the times shown here are all Eastern. This map is primarily made for people watching closing times across the United States, but can be used by anyone – so long as they convert the time. Another rather important list of closing times is in Electoral Votes. For a full list of times when Electoral College votes are required to be submitted, head to TheGreenPapers. BE CAREFUL though, as this webpage’s helpfulness is inversely proportional to the amount of eye-searing green color on the page. Don’t be mislead by the green, it’s really an extremely helpful and legit website with accurate information abound. For those of you not sure what’s on your ballot, head to the State Election Offices list linked above. Each page will have its own full ballot available for your perusal before you head in and vote. Every single state has a different set of measures and state-level politicians to vote for. For everyone: don’t be mislead by early results and “calling it now” news sources. Don’t take out any bets or trade any stock based on exit polling, that is to say. This election will only officially be over when it’s declared by the Federal Election Commission, and even then we’re going to expect a little bit of grumbling, at the very least.

They are, in short, mixed. I’ve had brief glimpses of the future that USB-C promises: a single port and a single cable for all gadgets. But figuring out how to get to that future means dealing with infuriatingly bad cables and hubs and trying to understand a hilariously complicated admixture of different protocols like Thunderbolt, HDMI, and DisplayPort that also theoretically work with this one single cable (plus all the dongles it currently requires). But friends, I have not even come close to scratching the surface. And I’m here to tell you that reading Google+ posts about USB-C charging specifications is strangely relaxing (at least when compared to following the election). We’ve already written many times about Benson Leung, the Google engineer who tests and reviews USB-C products. But you might not know that Leung has a compatriot in testing: Nathan K. K is an engineer who unapologetically goes deep on USB-C testing, criticizing everything from random cables to Google’s Pixel to Apple’s products. Turns out the latter have not always been quite as standards-compliant as they could be. Apple is quietly replacing one of its USB-C cables Earlier this year, Apple began a “voluntary exchange program” for USB-C cables that were designed alongside the original MacBook. And now it appears the company is silently updating that cable with a new, better version that still has the exact same model number. According to K, the new cable comes in a rectangular box (don’t buy one in a square box) and is the “best ‘charge’ cable I've ever seen.” (It also turns out that Apple is using different cables in its stores than it’s shipping to customers.) But I’m not going to get into the minutiae of Apple’s exchange program nor the specs of its cables and chargers: the Google+ community is doing a fine job of that. Instead, I just want to point out how much fun it is to watch an experienced engineer essentially do forensic analysis on consumer products. It’s fun even though I know that all this work is only necessary because so many of those products are legitimately dangerous to plug into your devices. Even the simplest thing — delivering a charge over a wire — turns out to be insanely complicated and filled with corporate politics. If diving into a bunch of Google+ pages isn’t your idea of a fun distraction, can I interest you in a USB-C Reddit thread? Perhaps a spreadsheet of tested, safe USB-C cables? How about an Android Common Compatibility Document that Android Police found? It detailing Google’s "STRONGLY RECOMMENDED" suggestion that USB-C Android devices adhere to the standard and don’t mess with pin-outs or voltages. That doesn’t sound like fun to you? Yes, this is what I’m doing instead of obsessively refreshing news on the election today and terrifying myself with electoral maps. Politics is exhausting, but USB-C forensic analysis is exhausting and a little heartening: it’s a mess, but we can fix it with science.

Featured Story: How to Root Android: Our Always-Updated Rooting Guide for Any Phone or Tablet Android Gadget Hacks: Unchaining Android to enable tomorrow's features today — WonderHowTo How To: Get Motorola's Active Display Features on Your Pixel or Nexus Dallas Thomas 6 days ago How to Get Motorola's Active Display Features on Your Pixel or Nexus Regardless of what they call them—be it Pixel or Nexus—Google's line of smartphones have a cool feature called "Ambient Display" that wakes your screen in a low-power black and white state when you receive a notification. This feature was added back when Google owned Motorola, as Moto's phones had a similar lock screen effect called "Active Display." But Motorola's implementation has always been the better of the two. Unlike Ambient Display, Active Display wakes your screen when you wave your hand in front of your phone, and it pulses every so often when you have an unread notification, among other advantages. The playing field has now been leveled, thanks to a new app from developer grokus. Without even requiring root, the app can add several extra wake gestures to Ambient Display, including wave to wake and flip to wake, so you can now get Motorola's best Active Display features on your Nexus or Pixel. Don't Miss: How to Root Your Pixel or Pixel XL Step 1: Enable Ambient Display This mod will only work if your phone or tablet already includes Google's Ambient Display feature, which is normally exclusive to Nexus (6, 5X, 6P, and 9) and Pixel devices. However, it's possible this would work if your device has a custom ROM that includes the Ambient Display feature. Either way, the first thing you'll need to do is make sure the Ambient Display feature is actually enabled. So head to the Display menu in Settings, then enable the switch next to the "Ambient display" option if it's not already turned on. If you don't see this option, you don't have Ambient Display. Step 2: Install Ambi-Turner Next up, you'll need to install the app that lets you customize the times when Ambient Display is activated. The free app is called Ambi-Turner, and you can grab it from the following link. Install Ambi-Turner from the Google Play Store Step 3: Enable Notification Access The first time you open Ambi-Turner, you'll be prompted to give the app notification access. This is how the app controls your Ambient Display feature, so enable the switch next to "notification listener" on this screen, then press "OK" on the popup and tap your back button once. Step 4: Adjust Options Next up, you'll be taken to the app's main menu, so from here, make sure the "Enabled" option is ticked. Beyond that, if you'd like to wake the Ambient Display feature when you tilt your phone while it's lying flat, scroll down a bit, then tick the box next to "Tilt To Wake." At this point, you'll be able to activate Ambient Display in three new ways. First, if your phone is in your pocket for more than 10 seconds, you'll see the Ambient Display screen as soon as you take it out. Second, if your phone is lying face-down for more than 10 seconds, you can flip it over to wake Ambient Display. And third, if your phone is lying flat and still, you can simply tilt it a little bit to wake the Ambient Display function. But just like Motorola's "Active Display" feature, Ambi-Turner has even more wake gestures. If you'd like to enable these, you'll need to purchase the pro version of the app for $0.99—but I'll show you how they work in the next step. Step 5: Adjust Additional Options (Pro Version Only) If you purchased the pro version of Ambi-Turner, there's a few more features you can enable to make Ambient Display more like Motorola's Active Display. For starters, you'll probably want these features enabled at all times, so tick the box next to "Start On Boot." Then, you can get Motorola's "Wave To Wake" feature by ticking the corresponding box in Ambi-Turner's settings. Once you do that, just select the number of waves it'll take to trigger Ambient Display, then you'll be able to wave your hand in front of the proximity sensor near your device's earpiece to wake your phone. Aside from that, you can enable "Wake On Interval" to get Motorola's pulsing notifications feature. If you do that, make sure to tap "Pulse Filter" afterwards, then select the apps that you would like to include. From now on, your phone will wake intermittently when you have unread notifications, which is a great alternative to a blinking LED indicator. Step 6: Get at-a-Glance Info in More Situations With everything set up, the Ambient Display feature on your phone should be much easier to trigger now. Depending on your settings, you can now lift your phone, take it out of your pocket, flip it over, or even wave at it, and your screen will partially wake to display at-a-glance information. The Ambient Display lock screen showing the time and notifications.

By Stephanie Condon for Between the Lines | November 8, 2016 -- 18:17 GMT (10:17 PST) | Topic: Cloud For Google Cloud Platform customers, Google has a recommendations engine for machine types and sizing, Google's Urs Hölzle said at the Structure conference on cloud computing on Tuesday. "I hope in five years, 1 percent of Cloud customers knows the word 'machine type' and 99 percent say, 'I never thought about it," said Hölzle, Google's senior VP for technical infrastructure, said at the San Francisco conference. Infrastructure, he said, "is one of those things where if you do it right, people don't care about it... This is something we're dealing with and not you." The Google comments rhyme with what's increasingly being pitched by the large infrastructure as a service players. For instance, Amazon Web Services has its Lambda effort, also known as a serverless managed service. The general idea is that AWS handles the infrastructure and manages it. Customers focus on the function required. Also: TechRepublic: AWS vs Microsoft Azure: Understanding the serverless application trend Google tries in several places to keep the customer from thinking about it, he said. For instance, users see the same API whether they're using high-end hot storage or low-end archival storage at less than a cent a month per gigabyte. Asked where the bottleneck is today, Hölzle said that currently, it's cheap, fast storage. Additionally, he said, compute is a pressure point because of machine learning. "Tomorrow, if NVRAM happens, it will be networking," he said. Microsoft continues its pivot to being all about cloud services It's not over for Windows and devices. But Microsoft's future is increasingly about the cloud and subscriptions, as its financials and corporate priorities show.

It turns out Home doesn’t hide a lot within its diminutive frame. The device only has two microphones. That’s notable insofar that Amazon’s Echo smart speaker, Home’s main inspiration and competitor, has seven microphones. Despite its less capable hardware, Google says Home is able to differentiate voices patterns from background noise just fine. iFixit was also discovered the device also uses a lot of the same motherboard components found in last year’s Chromecast — validating, at least in part, the pre-release rumour that Home was set to be just a repurposed Chromecast. With everything said and done, iFixit gave Home an eight out of 10 repairability score. Minus some problematic adhesive that helps keep the touch board attached to the upper case, all of Home’s other disparate components are easy to access and replace. Images courtesy of iFixit. SourceiFixit vn33 Is there any advantages waiting for and getting Google Home officially after it comes to Canada, as opposed to picking one up cross-border? meh You may want to wait on getting Google Home. There are two problems with it 1) it can only use ONE Google account to do searches, which means if you have many people in the house, only one of you will have complete use of it and 2) ANYONE can execute commands against your account as it doesn’t use Trusted Voice to know if it’s really you asking the question. These things are deal breakers for me. Arman How waiting for official launch in Canada will change those? meh It won’t change those problems. I am suggesting they do not buy it at all until those issues are resolved. There is nothing wrong with waiting for version 2 or 3 of a thing before you buy it. Arman Ok! Are you sure it works with everyone’s voice? Thought i heard in a review that it only works with the original voice that set it up. meh I don’t have personal experience with one – but based on several reviews, this is reported to be the case: that it will respond to anyone saying “ok Google” Arman Yes you were right, it only works with one account! The Iceman Cometh So? The Iceman Cometh Trusted voice doesn’t exist in the Echo either and really what’s the big deal? This is a device in your own home and unless you don’t “trust” your own family kinda ridiculous. As far as using one account that’s the same with Echo as well. Software updates may change this but hardware will have little impact thomas nguyen then you find out your kid did “ok google – Youtube Taylor Swift” on your google home while you are showing your friends your man cave and what you watch on youtube, they will continue to bring this up time and time again that @TheLastFullMeasure:disqus watches Taylor Swift in his spare time as he drinks beer with the boys The Iceman Cometh Haha. First world problems buddy. Jim_S I plan on making a separate Gmail account for the device. So no family access to my emails, etc. Russ I would label these as compromises rather than problems or issues. I acknowledge that they’re deal-breakers for your particular usage scenario, but they represent choices that were likely made to prioritize convenience and cost over security. I think that makes sense: always-on-always-listening devices are generally not targeted at consumers who prioritize privacy and security. That being said, I can offer a possible solution for Gen.2, which is to add a fingerprint reader that recognizes multiple users. You’d gain access to multiple accounts with reasonable security, and voice activation could be optional to appease everyone. This increases the flexibility and appeal for more users, but almost certainly increases the cost of a device that’s already pretty expensive for what it is. The Iceman Cometh Mine should be here by end of week as I ordered through a reseller in Texas. Very interested to see how this stacks up against Echo Faisal Lakhani hi. can u tell me who is the texas reseller The Iceman Cometh eBay actually. There are few resellers there but of course you’re going to pay a bit more considering shipping costs etc. I paid $220 CDN which I guess is about the norm given the exchange rate. PreferredGeoff I paid 189 cdn at best buy but had to go get it. Didn’t get charged any duty which was nice. thomas nguyen I’m paying $129 USD since I’m going to the US for a trip anyways. PreferredGeoff I paid 129 plus exchange works out to 189 Canadian. All in. PreferredGeoff Everybody pays 129 American as that the retail price 🙂 Unorthodox Why wait. Almost guarantied it will arrive to Canada in some castrated form. PreferredGeoff It works pretty good. The 1 account thing sucks. My wife and kids love it and fight about which music to play so all I hear is hey Google all night long between them. It works as expected in canada, knows my home is in abbotsford and gives weather for there. It’s a cool toy only had for a few days but kinda fun. David Chura More useless junk !

(Jessica McGowan/Getty Images) The long national nightmare of the 2016 campaign is finally coming to a close. There's been a lot of talk about the potentially irreparable damage this acrimonious contest has done to our civic fabric. But if there's any silver lining to the campaign, it may be that all the outlandish and divisive rhetoric is serving to get more people engaged with the political process. Here's one data point that speaks to our current level of civic engagement, from Google Trends: Peoples' interest in finding out where to vote has never been higher. Google searches for “where to vote” spike during presidential-election years, but never more than in 2016. The Google data shows that searches for “where to vote” account for about twice as much Google search volume this November as they have in previous presidential election years in 2004, 2008 and 2012. Broader search queries, such as “voting,” show a similar pattern — though those searches could be related to such information as early-vote tallies or to non-election voting for things like TV shows (America's Got Talent, etc.). A person wanting to know “where to vote,” on the other hand, is probably looking for specific, practical information on where to cast a ballot. The related queries that Google shows for this search bolster that assumption — they include queries on how to register, how to vote and voter eligibility. [Is voting a waste of time? Not if you do the math.] Other signs point to higher-than-normal voter turnout in 2016. More than 47 million voters have cast early ballots this year, smashing the previous early-voting record of 32 million in 2012. Some of that increase is due to simple population growth, and some of it comes from more states adding early and no-excuse absentee voting this year. Early voting also indicates that Latino participation may hit record levels this year. This is likely to be a boon for Hillary Clinton, given Trump's record-low support among Latino voters. Political betting markets have also recently taken a turn toward predicting higher turnout. At PredictIt, the odds for a turnout of 145 million voters — or more than roughly 63 percent turnout — have spiked in recent days. A number of that magnitude could be higher than the turnout in any election since the 1960s. High turnout could be favorable for the Clinton campaign. “Most often, higher turnout favors Democrats,” political scientist Michael P. McDonald told Factcheck.org earlier this year. This is because demographic groups that historically have low turnout rates — minorities and young people chief among them — tend to prefer Democratic candidates.

BUSINESS Technology The world's best gamers may one day compete against the smartest computers Paresh DaveContact Reporter Google cut power usage in its data centers by several percentage points earlier this year by trusting artificially intelligent software originally designed to beat 1980s-era Atari video games. And in the years to come, the Internet giant not only could save much more electricity, but also solve far larger problems by taking on a much more complex video game. Research scientists at Google’s DeepMind unit announced Friday they are developing a computer program that reads data about Blizzard Entertainment’s “StarCraft II” games and learns how to play on its own. The software would have to figure out how to split its attention between micromanagement and long-term strategic decisions. It’s that maneuvering that could deliver big breakthroughs. DeepMind sees endless possibilities to apply development lessons to programs in the energy, healthcare and technology sectors. The Irvine video game company imagines voice-synthesized broadcasters, coaching bots and virtual players that are tailored in strength to their human counterpart. Games could become more intricate and personalized. Along the way, e-sports battles could reach a new level with machine vs. human and machine vs. machine competitions. “I can’t wait to see the day where Google’s AI or someone else’s is playing with the best ‘StarCraft’ players in an e-sports arena,” said Gio Hunt, Blizzard’s executive vice president for corporate operations. “You could absolutely see a world with Google’s AI vs. Facebook’s AI vs. IBM’s AI.” BlizzCon goes all-in on e-sports Jeff Landa Part game conference and part sporting event, the two-day BlizzCon gathering at the Anaheim Convention Center reaffirmed team South Korea as the nation to beat in e-sports, no matter how new the video game. The country trounced every other national team to claim the first ever World Cup championship... Part game conference and part sporting event, the two-day BlizzCon gathering at the Anaheim Convention Center reaffirmed team South Korea as the nation to beat in e-sports, no matter how new the video game. The country trounced every other national team to claim the first ever World Cup championship... (Jeff Landa) Video games and artificial intelligence have long gone together. But the computer opponents in video games stick to a script. They look for certain triggers and respond based on written commands. The new wave of AI that Google, Amazon, Apple, Facebook and many others are pursuing rely on rule-less programs that analyze troves of data to discover the most appropriate response on its own. In the case of video games, it’s similar to how a beginning player would watch tutorial videos on YouTube and study how others play. They also do a ton of practice themselves. Over time, they pick up on what the best tactics are in a given scenario. Looking at a wide spectrum of matches, the computer can determine whether a specific move at a given point increased the chances of winning. “You have an agent and an environment,” DeepMind research scientist Oriol Vinyals said. “The agent observes and acts upon it. There’s several ways to act on an environment, and the agent has to do what’s best.” With 49 Atari games, DeepMind fed data to the computer about what was on the screen during play, including the score. Whether thrown into a boxing ring or a car racing course, the machine took over from there. It usually got close to or exceeded human scores. But Atari games are regarded as simple, with few levers and buttons to control. “StarCraft II” promises to advance the way the programs learn for several reasons. Players in the sci-fi strategy game can’t see the entire playing surface, meaning bots that play the game will function more like the ones that play poker and less like those that have conquered Go and chess. Users have to guess or spy on what their opponents are doing. It’s messy, like typical scenarios in reality. DeepMind wants to limit the AI to what humans would encounter in another way too. The game isn’t as simple as moving pieces around a board. Players must mine resources, deploy soldiers and launch attacks — and the order in which they act matters. The delicate balancing act is something computers don’t do well yet, and DeepMind isn’t going to let its software issue commands any faster than a human could. The intention is to generate new ideas about how to develop the training programs for computers and help them measure the value of different options. For example, in the data centers, Google’s systems might not know what caused a huge power spike — but they can take some guesses and act accordingly. The NFL of e-sports? Blizzard wants to create 'Overwatch' league with city-specific video game fans Paresh Dave Blizzard Entertainment pioneered e-sports with its “Starcraft” franchise more than a decade ago.  Now, with “Overwatch,” the Irvine video game maker wants to bring to e-sports the wealth and recognition that sports such as soccer, football and basketball generate. To do so, Blizzard Entertainment,...

To do so, Blizzard Entertainment,... (Paresh Dave) “Ideally, it will translate to a better cooling system,” Vinyals said, noting that power usage control is just one of endless possibilities to bring lessons out of virtual reality. Though DeepMind is spearheading the initial effort on “StarCraft II,” Blizzard Entertainment plans to enable anyone to tap into its systems for similar AI research starting early next year. The public should be able to access replays of online matches as well as the data and inputs needed for bots to compete in games. Blizzard executives said the company is just scratching the surface in terms of making use of its petabytes of data. It’s now in the hunt for someone to be the “database and analytics expert for the company,” according to a job posting. Sigaty noted for example how his team has discussed making statistics from “StarCraft II” matches publicly available for other companies to use in their apps. But it hasn’t made a call on whether to do so. Working with DeepMind is the bridge, he said, to start understanding how machine analysis can make its data “even more impactful.” Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss Trump names Priebus and Bannon as top aides, California National Guard interpreters say they're owed bonuses, UC and Cal State are considering their first tuition hikes in 6 years, and L.A.

The phones are uniquely branded by Google, but their roots still lie in HTC’s current host of devices, which include the same magnetic switch that can be used to turn the phone’s screen on or off when placed near magnets. According to 9 to 5 Google, the magnets can be found around the G logo that’s emblazoned on the back of the device. Placing a magnet there or around that location but in front of the device will trigger the magnetic switch to turn off the display. While Google itself doesn’t have a flip case available on the Google Store, you can bet case manufacturers will be taking advantage of this newly discovered feature as the Pixel and Pixel XL have sold out quickly and Google is working to make more stock available. local_offer    Google   Pixel   Pixel XL   Auto-load comments: Off On View comments (7) stars Further Reading Google Play Music gets smart redesign Project ARA Q&A The Verizon Pixel XL is delayed again The Play Store sees another update Verizon launches BOGO deal stars Popular this Weeklaunch 1 more_vertThis may be the Moto X 2017 closeHere’s our first look at the 2017 Moto X The Moto X 2017 may be alive and well as a new image has appeared which shows off the device’s metal body and camera cutout. 2 more_vertExclusive: Project ARA specifications, design closeExclusive: Project ARA specifications, design and photos Today’s exclusive Google Project ARA post reveals the phone’s spec sheet and 40 images which show off the phone’s unique modular design. 3 more_vertZTE wants to step up and fill the Nexus gap closeZTE wants to fill the gap left behind with the end of Nexus devices With the end of the Nexus line, there’s now a void in stock Android devices in the $400 range.

It provides a myriad of features including Realtime Database, Authentication (with email and password, Facebook, Twitter, GitHub and Google), Cloud Messaging, Storage, Hosting, Remote Config, Test Lab, Crash Reporting, Notification, App Indexing, Dynamic Links, Invites, AdWords and AdMob. More from this author Creating a Cloud Backend for Your Android App Using Firebase Adding Maps to an Android App with Google Play Services In this article, we’ll create a simple To Do app that will show how to save and retrieve data from Firebase, how to authenticate users, set read/write permissions on the data and validate the data on the server. Getting Started To get started, first download the repository that contains the starter project that we’ll use in the tutorial and then head over to Firebase and create an account if you don’t already have one. When you run the downloaded project, you will see a Login view. The Login view has a Register button that takes you to the Sign Up view when tapped; and on this view, there is a Sign Up form as well as a Login button that takes you back to the Login view. To add the Firebase libraries to the project, we’ll use CocoaPods. First make sure that you have CocoaPods installed on your computer. Open Terminal and navigate to the root of the downloaded project with cd Path/To/ToDo\ App (the \ escapes the whitespace in the directory name). Create a Podfile with the following command. pod init Then open the Podfile with: open -a Xcode Podfile Modify the file’s content as shown below. platform :ios, '10.0'

target 'ToDo App' do
  use_frameworks!

  pod 'Firebase/Auth'
  pod 'Firebase/Database'

end The Firebase library consists of different subspecs. In the above, we include the /Auth subspec which is used for authentication and the /Database subspec that is needed to work with the Firebase realtime database. The /Core subspec is required for your app to work with Firebase, but we don’t have to include it in the Podfile because the subspecs we added depend on it. Therefore, when we run pod install to fetch the project’s dependencies, the /Core library will be fetched as well. Run pod install to fetch the project’s dependencies. After installation is complete, close the Xcode project and open ToDo App.xcworkspace. Next, head over to the Firebase console and click on the Create a New Project button. A dialog window will pop up for you to input the project’s details. Enter a name and country/region for the project. The country/region represents the country/region of your organisation/company. Your selection also sets the appropriate currency for your revenue reporting. After setting a name (I used ToDoApp) and region for the project, click on the Create Project button. A project will be created and its console opened. From the project’s console, click on the Add Firebase to your iOS App option. Then enter your iOS project data in the window that pops up. We’ll leave the App Store ID field blank, but if you are integrating Firebase to an app that is on the App Store, you can find the ID in your app’s URL. In the example below, 123456789 is the App Store ID. https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/yourapp/id123456789 Click on the Add App button and a GoogleService-Info.plist file will be downloaded to your machine. Move the file into the root of your Xcode project and add it to all targets. The plist file contains configuration settings that the iOS app needs to communicate with the Firebase servers. It contains such things as the URL to the Firebase project, the API key, e.t.c. In the previous version of Firebase, you had to store these manually in your app’s code, but now the process has been simplified with the use of one file that contains the needed data. If you are using versioning and storing your code in a public repository, you should consider not making the GoogleService-Info.plist publicly accessible. If it’s used beyond its limits, it will stop working and if you are on a paid plan, you wouldn’t want anyone abusing that and running up your costs. On the Firebase console, press Continue to move forward in the project setup. We’ve already done the above steps, so click on Continue. Follow the instructions on the last page of the dialog and add the Firebase initialisation code to your AppDelegate class. This connects to Firebase when the app starts. Add the following import to AppDelegate.swift import Firebase Then add the following to application(_: didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:), before the return statement. FIRApp.configure() On the Firebase console, click on Finish to complete the project setup. Security and Rules Before retrieving and saving data from the Firebase server, we’ll set up authentication and add rules that restrict access to data and validate user input before it’s saved. Authentication The Firebase API enables you to setup email/password, Facebook, Twitter, GitHub, Google and anonymous authentication. In our app, we’ll use email/password authentication. To enable email/password authentication, select Authentication from the left panel of the Firebase console and navigate to the Sign-In Method tab. Enable the Email/Password authentication provider and click on Save. Back in Xcode, modify LoginViewController.swift as shown. import UIKit
import FirebaseAuth

class LoginViewController: UIViewController {

    @IBOutlet weak var emailField: UITextField!
    @IBOutlet weak var passwordField: UITextField!

    override func viewDidAppear(_ animated: Bool) {
        super.viewDidAppear(animated)

        if let _ = FIRAuth.auth()?.currentUser {
            self.signIn()
        }
    }

    @IBAction func didTapSignIn(_ sender: UIButton) {
        let email = emailField.text
        let password = passwordField.text
        FIRAuth.auth()?.signIn(withEmail: email!, password: password!, completion: { (user, error) in
            guard let _ = user else {
                if let error = error {
                    if let errCode = FIRAuthErrorCode(rawValue: error._code) {
                        switch errCode {
                        case .errorCodeUserNotFound:
                            self.showAlert("User account not found. Try registering")
                        case .errorCodeWrongPassword:
                            self.showAlert("Incorrect username/password combination")
                        default:
                            self.showAlert("Error: \(error.localizedDescription)")
                        }
                    }
                    return
                }
                assertionFailure("user and error are nil")
            }

            self.signIn()
        })
    }

    @IBAction func didRequestPasswordReset(_ sender: UIButton) {
        let prompt = UIAlertController(title: "To Do App", message: "Email:", preferredStyle: .alert)
        let okAction = UIAlertAction(title: "OK", style: .default) { (action) in
            let userInput = prompt.textFields![0].text
            if (userInput!.isEmpty) {
                return
            }
            FIRAuth.auth()?.sendPasswordReset(withEmail: userInput!, completion: { (error) in
                if let error = error {
                    if let errCode = FIRAuthErrorCode(rawValue: error._code) {
                        switch errCode {
                        case .errorCodeUserNotFound:
                            DispatchQueue.main.async {
                                self.showAlert("User account not found. Try registering")
                            }
                        default:
                            DispatchQueue.main.async {
                                self.showAlert("Error: \(error.localizedDescription)")
                            }
                        }
                    }
                    return
                } else {
                    DispatchQueue.main.async {
                        self.showAlert("You'll receive an email shortly to reset your password.")
                    }
                }
            })
        }
        prompt.addTextField(configurationHandler: nil)
        prompt.addAction(okAction)
        present(prompt, animated: true, completion: nil)
    }

    func showAlert(_ message: String) {
        let alertController = UIAlertController(title: "To Do App", message: message, preferredStyle: UIAlertControllerStyle.alert)
        alertController.addAction(UIAlertAction(title: "Dismiss", style: UIAlertActionStyle.default,handler: nil))
        self.present(alertController, animated: true, completion: nil)
    }

    func signIn() {
        performSegue(withIdentifier: "SignInFromLogin", sender: nil)
    }

} In the above code, we first check whether the user is signed in in viewDidAppear(). FIRAuth.auth()?.currentUser gives the authenticated user (if any). The user is represented by a FIRUser object. If they are signed in, we call signIn() which performs a segue that is already created in the storyboard file. This segue navigates to the ItemsTableViewController which is where our list of items will be shown. didTapSignIn() sends the user’s input to Firebase for authentication. FIRAuth.auth()?.signIn(withEmail: password: completion:) is used to sign in a user using the email and password combination. Each of the authentication providers (e.g. Google, Facebook, Twitter, Github, e.t.c) uses a different method call. When the user is successfully authenticated, signIn() is called, otherwise an error message will be shown to the user. If authentication fails, an NSError object is returned back from the server. It carries an error code that you can use to determine the cause of the error and give the user an appropriate error message. In the above code, we give different error messages when the user enters a non existent account or when they enter the wrong password. For other errors, we show the user a description of the error with error.localizedDescription. In a real app, you might not want to show this to the user. The message returned by error.localizedDescription is best suited for the developer when debugging, but for your users, you should use a better catch-all error message. didRequestPasswordReset() is called when the Forgot Password button is tapped. Here, we create an alert box that the user can use to enter an email address where the Password Reset email will be sent. This is another of the many advantages offered by Firebase. Password reset functionality has already been set up; you don’t have to code it up yourself. If you look at the Firebase control under Authentication > Email templates, you can modify the email message sent to users for Email address verification, Password reset and Email address change. Note that in the code above, the alert is called in the main thread by using DispatchQueue.main.async and not in the background thread that handles the callback function. Any code that updates the app’s UI should be run in the main queue. To test the password reset functionality, you can create a User on the Firebase console under Authentication > Users > Add User. Enter an email and password for the User (use a real email if you want to receive the password reset email). Back in Xcode, run the project. You should be able to enter an email and have the password reset email sent to it. With the Login functionality done, let us now add the Sign Up functionality. Modify SignUpViewController as shown. import UIKit
import FirebaseAuth

class SignUpViewController: UIViewController {

    @IBOutlet weak var emailField: UITextField!
    @IBOutlet weak var passwordField: UITextField!

    @IBAction func didTapSignUp(_ sender: UIButton) {
        let email = emailField.text
        let password = passwordField.text
        FIRAuth.auth()?.createUser(withEmail: email!, password: password!, completion: { (user, error) in
            if let error = error {
                if let errCode = FIRAuthErrorCode(rawValue: error._code) {
                    switch errCode {
                    case .errorCodeInvalidEmail:
                        self.showAlert("Enter a valid email.")
                    case .errorCodeEmailAlreadyInUse:
                        self.showAlert("Email already in use.")
                    default:
                        self.showAlert("Error: \(error.localizedDescription)")
                    }
                }
                return
            }
            self.signIn()
        })
    }

    @IBAction func didTapBackToLogin(_ sender: UIButton) {
        self.dismiss(animated: true, completion: {})
    }

    func showAlert(_ message: String) {
        let alertController = UIAlertController(title: "To Do App", message: message, preferredStyle: UIAlertControllerStyle.alert)
        alertController.addAction(UIAlertAction(title: "Dismiss", style: UIAlertActionStyle.default,handler: nil))
        self.present(alertController, animated: true, completion: nil)
    }

    func signIn() {
        performSegue(withIdentifier: "SignInFromSignUp", sender: nil)
    }

} In the above code, when the user taps on the Create Account button didTapSignUp() is called. Here, we take the user’s input and call FIRAuth.auth()?.createUser(withEmail: password: completion:) to try and create an account with the entered details. If signup fails, an error message is shown, otherwise signIn() is called which performs a segue to the ItemsTableViewController. This segue had already been created in the storyboard file of the starter project. Run the app. You should be able to create an account and confirm its creation on the Firebase console. If you had previously logged in, and thus can’t get to the Login view, you can reset the simulator with Simulator > Reset Content and Settings. By default, Firebase sets a rule on the accepted length of the password – it must be at least 6 characters long. You can set more rules on this, on the Firebase Console. Shortly, we’ll see how to set up rules. More on this here. Authorization and Data Validation The Firebase Realtime Database provides an expression-based rules language with JavaScript-like syntax to easily define how your data should be structured, how it should be indexed, and when your data can be read from and written to. Combined with our authentication services, you can define who has access to what data and protect your users’ personal information from unauthorized access. We’ve set up authentication for our project, but we can make users data even more secure by defining some rules for it. By default, Firebase has the following rules viewable by navigating to Database > Rules on the console. {
  "rules": { ".read": "auth != null", ".write": "auth != null" } } The above security rules require users to be authenticated to read or write any data to the database. Modify the rules as shown and hit Publish. {
  "rules": { "users": { "$uid": { ".read": "auth != null && auth.uid == $uid", ".write": "auth != null && auth.uid == $uid", "items": { "$item_id": { "title": { ".validate": "newData.isString() && newData.val().length > 0" } } } } } } } In the above, auth != null && auth.uid == $uid has been set on the read and write permissions. With this rule, not only will the user need to be authenticated to read or write any data to the database, but they will also only have access to their own data. Firebase stores data in JSON format. In our database, each user will have an array of to-do items named items. Each item will have a title. In the above, we add some validation that ensures that an item with an empty title won’t be saved. Saving Data With authentication and authorization done, we’ll now see how data can be saved and retrieved to and from Firebase. First create a new file called Item.swift and modify it as shown. This will be the Item model class Each Item will have a title and ref which will hold a FIRDatabaseReference object. A FIRDatabaseReference represents a particular location in your Firebase Database and can be used for reading or writing data to that Firebase Database location. import Foundation
import FirebaseDatabase

class Item {

    var ref: FIRDatabaseReference?
    var title: String?

    init (snapshot: FIRDataSnapshot) {
        ref = snapshot.ref

        let data = snapshot.value as! Dictionary<String, String>
        title = data["title"]! as String } } Then modify ItemsTableViewController as shown. import UIKit
import Firebase

class ItemsTableViewController: UITableViewController {

    var user: FIRUser!
    var items = [Item]()
    var ref: FIRDatabaseReference!
    private var databaseHandle: FIRDatabaseHandle!

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()

        user = FIRAuth.auth()?.currentUser
        ref = FIRDatabase.database().reference()
        startObservingDatabase()
    }

    // MARK: - Table view data source

    override func numberOfSections(in tableView: UITableView) -> Int {
        return 1
    }

    override func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, numberOfRowsInSection section: Int) -> Int {
        return items.count
    }

    override func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, cellForRowAt indexPath: IndexPath) -> UITableViewCell {
        let cell = tableView.dequeueReusableCell(withIdentifier: "Cell", for: indexPath)
        let item = items[indexPath.row]
        cell.textLabel?.text = item.title
        return cell
    }

    override func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, commit editingStyle: UITableViewCellEditingStyle, forRowAt indexPath: IndexPath) {
        if editingStyle == .delete {
            let item = items[indexPath.row]
            item.ref?.removeValue()
        }
    }

    @IBAction func didTapSignOut(_ sender: UIBarButtonItem) {
        do {
            try FIRAuth.auth()?.signOut()
            performSegue(withIdentifier: "SignOut", sender: nil)
        } catch let error {
            assertionFailure("Error signing out: \(error)")
        }
    }

    @IBAction func didTapAddItem(_ sender: UIBarButtonItem) {
        let prompt = UIAlertController(title: "To Do App", message: "To Do Item", preferredStyle: .alert)
        let okAction = UIAlertAction(title: "OK", style: .default) { (action) in
            let userInput = prompt.textFields![0].text
            if (userInput!.isEmpty) {
                return
            }
            self.ref.child("users").child(self.user.uid).child("items").childByAutoId().child("title").setValue(userInput)
        }
        prompt.addTextField(configurationHandler: nil)
        prompt.addAction(okAction)
        present(prompt, animated: true, completion: nil);

    }

    func startObservingDatabase () {
        databaseHandle = ref.child("users/\(self.user.uid)/items").observe(.value, with: { (snapshot) in
            var newItems = [Item]()

            for itemSnapShot in snapshot.children {
                let item = Item(snapshot: itemSnapShot as! FIRDataSnapshot)
                newItems.append(item)
            }

            self.items = newItems
            self.tableView.reloadData()

        })
    }

    deinit {
        ref.child("users/\(self.user.uid)/items").removeObserver(withHandle: databaseHandle)
    }
} In the above, we start off by instantiating some variables in viewDidLoad(). We set user with the value of the logged in user and then set ref with a FIRDatabaseReference object. FIRDatabase.database().reference() gets a FIRDatabaseReference for the root of your Firebase Database. We then call startObservingDatabase(). In startObservingDatabase() we set a listener for any changes to the database. Firebase data is retrieved by attaching an asynchronous listener to a FIRDatabase reference. The listener is triggered once for the initial state of the data and again anytime the data changes. To add an event listener, we use the observeEventType() method to specify an event type and callback block. You can listen for the following types of events: FIRDataEventTypeValue – Read and listen for changes to the entire contents of a path. FIRDataEventTypeChildAdded – Retrieve lists of items or listen for additions to a list of items. Suggested use with FIRDataEventTypeChildChanged and FIRDataEventTypeChildRemoved to monitor changes to lists. FIRDataEventTypeChildChanged – Listen for changes to the items in a list. Use with FIRDataEventTypeChildAdded and FIRDataEventTypeChildRemoved to monitor changes to lists. FIRDataEventTypeChildRemoved – Listen for items being removed from a list. Use with FIRDataEventTypeChildAdded and FIRDataEventTypeChildChanged to monitor changes to lists. FIRDataEventTypeChildMoved – Listen for changes to the order of items in an ordered list. FIRDataEventTypeChildMoved events always follow the FIRDataEventTypeChildChanged event that caused the item’s order to change (based on your current order-by method). We listen for the FIRDataEventTypeValue event. You use the FIRDataEventTypeValue event to read the data at a given path, as it exists at the time of the event. This method is triggered once when the listener is attached and again every time the data, including any children, changes. The event callback is passed a snapshot containing all data at that location, including child data. If there is no data, the value of the snapshot returned is nil. Note that the FIRDataEventTypeValue event is fired every time data is changed at the specified database reference, including changes to children. To limit the size of your snapshots, you should attach only at the highest level needed for watching changes. For example, attaching a listener to the root of your database is not recommended. In our code, we attach the listener to /users/{user id}/items which is the path that will hold a user’s items. The listener receives a FIRDataSnapshot that contains the data at the specified location in the database at the time of the event in its value property. If no data exists at the location, the value is nil. From the snapshot, we create Item objects set them to the items array that is used to populate the table view. We then reload the table view to reflect the data change. numberOfSectionsInTableView(), tableView(_: numberOfRowsInSection:) and tableView(_: cellForRowAtIndexPath) are the usual table view functions used to set the table view’s data. The app contains an Add button in its navigation bar, which when tapped, calls didTapAddItem(). Here, we show the user an Alert box that they can use to add an item to the table view. We save the value added by the user to /users/{user id}/items/{item id}/title/. There are four methods for writing data to the Firebase Realtime Database: setValue – Write or replace data to a defined path, such as users/<user-id>/<username>. childByAutoId – Add to a list of data. Every time you call childByAutoId, Firebase generates a unique key that can also be used as a unique identifier, such as user-posts/<user-id>/<unique-post-id>. updateChildValues – Update some of the keys for a defined path without replacing all of the data. runTransactionBlock – Update complex data that could be corrupted by concurrent updates. The child() function grabs the reference of a particular node if it exists or creates it if it doesn’t exist. We use childByAutoId() to set a unique ID to every item that will be created. We then use setValue() to add the user’s input as the value for item’s title. tableView(_: commitEditingStyle: forRowAtIndexPath:) makes the table view editable. With this, the user will be able to swipe on an item to delete it. We call removeValue() with a reference to the swiped on item. This removes the data at that location in the database. After deleting an item, we don’t have to make any changes to the table view. Remember that we set a listener to any changes made on the ../items/ path on the database, so the callback we set for this will be responsible for updating the table. didTapSignOut() is called when the Sign Out button on the app’s navigation bar is tapped. Here we sign out the user and perform a segue back to the Login screen. Run the app and you should be able to add an item. Any item you add will be added to the table view. Check the Firebase Console, and you will see the added data. To delete an item, swipe on it to reveal a Delete button. That brings us to the end of the tutorial. We’ve seen how to save and retrieve data to and from the Firebase realtime database, and how to set up authentication and data authorization. The data saving we’ve looked at is ideal for simple data types such as NSString, NSNumber, NSArray and NSDictionary. If you want to save files like images or documents to Firebase, then look into Firebase Storage. The tutorial was a quick intro to using Firebase, it was not an exhaustive look into all that Firebase does. For this, be sure to read through the documentation. You can download the completed project here. Remember to add the GoogleService-Info.plist file generated from Firebase to the project. Note You might have noticed some warnings in your project after adding the Firebase libraries, or on running the completed project if you downloaded it. The warning error message states Conflicting nullability specifier on return types, 'nullable' conflicts with existing specifier 'nonnull'. This little bug came with the update of Firebase to Swift 3 and the issue has been filed. If you look at the message threads in that last link, the issue has been fixed, but changes won’t be seen in Firebase until the next release. The app still works despite this.

SUBSCRIBE Google introduces Android Auto ‘phone-screen experience’ to expand market Initiative seeks to make Android Auto experience accessible on the handset, to those without compatible in-dash displays. Greg Sterling on November 8, 2016 at 1:27 pm More According to Google, Android Auto is now available from “more than 50 [automotive] brands” on in-dash screens. However, seeking to accelerate adoption and reach the broader market of drivers who don’t own one of those compatible cars, the company is introducing an Android Auto experience for smartphones. It makes a version of the Android Auto in-car experience available to those without in-dash displays: [W]e’re excited to introduce a whole new way to use Android Auto: right on your phone screen! This update allows anyone with an Android phone (running 5.0 or later) to use a driver friendly interface to access the key stuff you need on the road ― directions, music, communications ― without the distraction of things that aren’t essential while driving. Whether your phone is connected to a compatible car display, or placed in a car mount on the dashboard, Android Auto brings your favorite apps and services into one place, making them accessible in safer and seamless ways. You can bring your music with you with apps like Spotify, Pandora or Google Play Music, and make calls or send messages with hands-free voice commands. And of course, get turn-by-turn directions to your next destination with Google Maps. If using a Bluetooth enabled car mount, the app will automatically fire up when it’s paired with the mount. Google adds that it’s also beefing up OK Google voice commands so that drivers can access maps, music and messaging in the Android Auto app. (Can’t you access all those things independently now via voice command?) Google says the “phone screen experience will be rolling out in the coming days to more than 30 countries where Android Auto is currently available.” It requires an Android phone and, as mentioned, Android 5.0 or later. There’s no iOS version. About The Author Greg Sterling Greg Sterling is a Contributing Editor at Search Engine Land.

And while you can't vote online -- or via text message -- there are a host of tech companies that have developed tools to make the process easier -- from finding the nearest poll to making informed decisions. Google: A voting-related doodle on Google's (GOOGL, Tech30) homepage serves as a constant reminder to vote every time you use the search giant. Clicking on the doodle directs you to a "where do I vote" search page to find the closest polling location. Twitter: Sending a direct message on Twitter (TWTR, Tech30) to the handle @Gov will also surface polling locations. People can chat with the @Gov bot to find out more about individual candidates, ballot measures, or find a different polling location. Facebook: Don't have Twitter? No problem. Facebook also has a tool to help people find the nearest polling spot. Go to the "Elections 2016" tab on the left column. Enter the address where you're registered to vote and Facebook (FB, Tech30) will connect to a third party site to map the closest location. Facebook also has a host of different tools on its Elections page, including voting ID requirements, ballot previews, and of course, an option to share that you voted and encourage friends to do the same. Related: These companies will be closed on Election Day HelloVote: Those who registered to vote using chatbot HelloVote will receive reminder text messages. The bot will also surface polling location info, transit and driving directions, state ID requirements, weather notifications, social sharing (including an "I voted" selfie feature). People can also give feedback on their polling experience. And, Hillary Clinton's campaign has set up a hotline to answer voter questions themselves in real time. People can tweet or DM @HFA on Twitter, or text "Question" to 472-46, and her team will reply. CNNMoney reached out to Donald Trump's campaign to see if it has developed any similar tool and will update when it responds. Uber: The ride-sharing company is teaming with Google to tell riders their polling location, and easily request a ride there. In Pennsylvania, voters can use the promo code "VOTEPA" to get a $15 credit on a ride to the polls, and $15 on a ride home, courtesy of My Ride to Vote. Voters in North Carolina and Florida can text "Go Vote" to 73179 to get a free Uber ride, thanks to Rock the Vote and Voto Latino. Lyft: As America gears up to elect its 45th president, Lyft is giving a 45% discount on one ride on Election Day in the following markets: Atlanta; Baltimore; Boston; Charlotte; Chicago; Dallas; Denver; Detroit; Miami; Minneapolis-St. Paul; Nashville; New Orleans; the New York City; all of New Jersey; Philadelphia; Phoenix; Portland, Oregon; Raleigh; San Diego and Washington D.C. For a totally free Lyft ride, voters in Pennsylvania, Ohio, North Carolina, Florida, Texas and California should text "Go Vote" to 73179. Zipcar: For last-minute voters, Zipcar is making 7,000 vehicles around the country free for its members from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. There are also tools to make sure that once you get to the polls, voters stay hungry and hydrated. Pizza to the Polls is a platform for donating pizzas to volunteers and voters in areas with long voting lines. "Send us reports of long lines and we'll send in the delicious reinforcements," the site reads. And Foursquare's "Vote, then Eat" tool maps out bars, restaurants and coffee shops that are nearest to your polling location. Matt McFarland contributed to this report.

Here's how it will help business users. By Alison DeNisco | November 8, 2016, 8:59 AM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus Image: Google Google recently announced new iOS Gmail and Google Calendar updates that could help enterprise users work more quickly and effectively, the company said. It marks the biggest update to the apps in nearly four years, according to Google product manager Matthew Izatt, who wrote a blog post on Monday explaining the new updates. The Gmail update includes "a fresh new look, sleeker transitions and some highly-requested features," Izatt said in the post. It also will run faster than in the past, he said.

SEE: Google boasts HTTPS adoption numbers, gives advice to businesses making the switch According to the blog post, Gmail app users on iOS can now: Undo Send, just like you do on the desktop, to prevent embarrassing email mistakes Search faster with instant results and spelling suggestions (like when you type "flighht," but you really meant "flight") Swipe to archive or delete, to quickly clear items out of your inbox The company also updated Google Calendar, which the post says includes the following new features developed based on user feedback: Month and week view in landscape, so you have even more ways to see your schedule at a glance Spotlight Search support, so you can search for events, Reminders and Goals in Apple's Spotlight Search and find what you're looking for faster Alternate calendars. If you often look up dates in a non-Gregorian calendar—like Lunar, Islamic, or Hindu—you can now add that calendar to easily see those dates alongside your current calendar The updates to Gmail and Google Calendar further Google's push to appeal to enterprise users. The company has also recently made investments in hardware, with the Google Pixel phone and the Jamboard digital whiteboard for conference rooms. However, Google still has hurdles to overcome before it is a top enterprise choice for hardware. We recently polled the TechRepublic CIO Jury panel of tech leaders, asking "Would you trust Google hardware in the enterprise?" Seven of our IT executive panelists said no, while five said yes. Google said it will continue to improve both Gmail and Calendar for iOS in the future. The 3 big takeaways for TechRepublic readers Google recently announced the first significant updates to Gmail and Google Calendar for iOS in four years, available now. The updates for Gmail include an Undo Send option and faster search capabilities, while Google Calendar now offers Spotlight Search support and alternate calendars. These updates further Google's efforts to be useful to business users, along with recent enterprise hardware and software offerings. Keep up to date on all the latest app updates.

"Many enterprises have successfully deployed Kubernetes based on the publicly available documentation and free support available from our large and growing community," said Dan Kohn, Executive Director of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation. "CNCF's new offerings will enable enterprises that want additional support to be confident that they are working with Kubernetes experts, which is increasingly in demand." The KMSP program will ensure enterprises get the support they're looking for to roll out new applications more quickly and more efficiently than before, while feeling secure that there's a trusted and vetted partner that's available to support their production and operational needs. It launches today with nine partners on board including: Apprenda, Canonical, Cisco, Container Solutions, CoreOS, Deis, Huawei, LiveWyer and Samsung SDS. Google has also committed to assist in the curriculum and certification development. The program includes the following components: A CNCF working group of Kubernetes experts who will collaboratively develop an open source curriculum and make it available under the Creative Commons By Attribution license for anyone to use. CNCF is developing an online, proctored certification program to test that curriculum. The program will be run by The Linux Foundation for CNCF. A free edX massively open online course (MOOC) covering the introductory sections of the curriculum will be released by leveraging The Linux Foundation's existing edX partnership; 650,000 people have registered for The Linux Foundation's Intro to Linux course on edX. Kubernetes training will be offered by The Linux Foundation and will also be available from other service providers who can leverage the open source curriculum. Requirements to become a Kubernetes Managed Service Provider will include: three or more certified engineers, demonstrable activity in the Kubernetes community including active contribution and a business model to support enterprise end users. Prometheus, OpenTracing and other CNCF project support will be added in as additional content modules over time with the possibility of a Prometheus (etc.) Managed Service Provider program in the future. The self-paced, online course will teach the skills needed to create and configure a real-world working Kubernetes cluster. The training course will be available soon, and the certification program is expected to be available in the second quarter of 2017. The course is open now at the discounted price of $99 (regularly $199) for a limited time. Sign up here to pre-register for the course. The KMSP program is a pre-qualified tier of highly vetted service providers who have deep experience helping enterprises successfully adopt Kubernetes. The KMSP partners offer SLA-backed Kubernetes support, consulting, professional services and training for organizations embarking on their Kubernetes journey. The Linux Foundation offers a neutral home for running such programs, thanks to its close involvement in the open source community. It is already helping develop technology for DevOps professionals through its open source projects and offers several related free massive open online courses (MOOCs), including: Intro to Linux, Intro to Cloud Infrastructure Technologies, Introduction to OpenStack and Introduction to DevOps: Transforming and Improving Operations. In the coming weeks, any CNCF or Kubernetes community member who wants to provide input on the criteria and baseline requirements for certification is encouraged to join the Certification Working Group. Google has committed to assist, and many others, including Apprenda, Container Solutions, CoreOS, Deis and Samsung, have expressed interest in participating in the Working Group. To join the working group, go to this link. Supporting Quotes from KMSP Partners Apprenda: "We have been supporting some of the earliest adopters of Kubernetes well before 1.0," said Sinclair Schuller, CEO of Apprenda.

The company will now display the results of the election directly in search in over 30 languages, as soon as the polls close, as well as YouTube live streaming election results coverage from several news rooms including NBC, PBS, MTV, Bloomberg, Telemundo and The Young Turks. “For the past several months, Google has helped people find information about the democratic process: our search results have helped voters register and explained the voting process with information on how to vote, who’s on their ballot, and how to find their local polling place in both English and Spanish,” the company said on its official blog. Although presidential elections attract groupie levels of attention from voters around the states, this one in particular has engaged more than most, perhaps down to the confrontational manner of the candidates. This has been reflected through search results on Google and the content watched on YouTube. “Over the past few week’s viewers spent over 20 million hours watching – and re-watching – the presidential debate live streams on YouTube,” the company’s blog states. While this is a very impressive number, there must be a few execs who are secretly hoping Trump finally loses his cool, vaults across the podium in a maddened frenzy, blonde hair flying every direction and b*tch slaps Clinton with a degree from Trump University, while repeatedly shouting ‘don’t use Gmail, don’t use Gmail’. You could almost guarantee this would break some YouTube records.   Tags: Google, US Election, YouTube Leave a comment Cancel reply Connect with: -or- Log in with your Telecoms.com account Alternatively, post a comment by completing the form below: Your email address will not be published.

Pierce: BYU needs ESPN for scheduling and bowls By SCOTT D. PIERCE | The Salt Lake Tribune First Published Nov 08 2016 10:45AM    •    Last Updated Nov 08 2016 06:39 pm BYU wide receiver Mitchell Juergens (87) pulls in a long pass at the one yard line defended by Boise State linebacker Tanner Vallejo (20) and safety Chanceller James (3), during an NCAA college football game in Boise, Idaho, Thursday, Oct. 20, 2016.

(Darin Oswald /Idaho Statesman via AP) Sports on TV » Netflix, Amazon, Google, Facebook can’t help the Cougars when it counts. Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY (2) The American Athletic Conference, after heaving a big sigh of relief that the Big 12 didn't expand, is looking to its television future — and looking outside the box. No longer fearing losing members to the Big 12, the AAC is pondering future TV deals. Its football contract with ESPN ends in 2019, which could be the same year that BYU's ESPN deal expires. (ESPN has the option to extend it from '18 through '19.) As it stands, BYU is better off than the AAC. Each member of that conference makes less than $3 million per year from ESPN — a deal that includes basketball. BYU makes somewhere between $3.2 million and $6 million per year for football only. (Estimates place the Cougars' payout between $800,000 and $1.2 million per home game; BYU is guaranteed four home games per year on ESPN channels, but it has had five some seasons.) VIDEOS TOP JOBS It's a commissioner's job to talk up his league, and AAC commissioner Mike Aresco did just that recently. "We know we have a chance to really do something special with our teams," he said, according to the Memphis Commercial-Appeal. "A big TV deal in a few years is really going to be a big aspect of our future." It's all relative. For an AAC school, $5 million would be big and $10 million would be huge. For a Big Ten school, that would be nothing — but Big Ten schools are projected to pull in $48 million or more EACH in TV revenue by 2018. But Aresco is bullish. He believes he can attract the interest of not just traditional TV outlets like ESPN, Fox, CBS and NBC, but online outlets like Amazon, Netflix, Google and Facebook. Amazon will stream some AAC women's basketball games this season, so might that be the future? Might that be the future for BYU, too? There's a major difference, however. AAC teams have to schedule only four football games a year; they play eight league games. This season, the 12 AAC schools scheduled a total of 21 games against teams from Power Five conferences; BYU alone played six P5 teams. Independent BYU needs the scheduling help ESPN can provide and Amazon, Netflix, Google and Facebook cannot. And the AAC has seven bowl tie-ins. They're not great, but they're the kind of bowls BYU has played in since going independent. The Cougars have even played in two current AAC bowls (Armed Forces and Miami Beach). Including this year's trip to the Poinsettia Bowl (if they win one more game), all six of the Cougars' post-independence bowl games will have been on ESPN; two (Armed Forces and Las Vegas) are owned by ESPN — as is the 2019 tie-in (Hawaii Bowl). ESPN can get the Cougars into a bowl; Amazon, Netflix, Google and Facebook cannot. There's more to it than just who would pay BYU the most for its TV rights. As for the relief that Aresco felt when the Big 12 decided not to expand, leaving his league intact and BYU standing at the altar— the only indication we have so far is that the Big 12 sold out cheap. Big 12 commissioner Bob Bowlsby issued a denial, but the Sports Business Journal reported that ESPN bought out the clause mandating it (and Fox) pay an extra $25 million to $30 million per year for each school the league added — for $1 million per year. Total. That's $125,000 per school per year. Again, Bowlsby insists the league is still negotiating with ESPN and Fox. But it still sounds like another slap in the face on top of the dog-and-pony show that ended with no expansion. Scott D. Pierce covers television for The Salt Lake Tribune .

Featured Story: 5 Things You Didn't Know Your iPhone's Home Button Could Do iOS Gadget Hacks: Unchaining iPhone & iPad to get tomorrow's features today — WonderHowTo How To: Transfer Your Android Contacts to iPhone Dallas Thomas 2 weeks ago How to Transfer Your Android Contacts to iPhone When you change smartphone ecosystems, there are a lot of minor hurdles to clear along the way. It's definitely not hard to switch from Android to iOS, but little things like making sure your contacts get transferred over can take a bit of work. So if you've recently ditched your old Android device and upgraded to an iPhone, and you're missing all of your email addresses and phone numbers, you'll need to export your contacts from Google, then import them to iCloud. Luckily, though, it's a fairly simple process, and all you need is a Mac or a Windows PC to do it. Don't Miss: 23 Important Apps That Work Great on Both Android & iOS Note: Apple does have an Android app called Move to iOS that makes it easy to transfer all your content, including contacts, but you have to use it during the initial setup of your iPad, iPhone, or iPod touch. Plus, it's overkill if you're just trying to get your contacts on iOS, so the manual way below is the better way to go. Step 1: Export Your Google Contacts To start, head to the Google Contacts page, then make sure you're signed in with the same Google account you used on your Android device. Google is in the process of debuting a new Contacts website, and the new version doesn't allow you to export your contacts just yet. Some users may see this new website when they click the above link, and others will still see the old page. The new Contacts page can be distinguished by the blue bar across the top of the screen, so if you see this after clicking the above link, expand the "More" category on the left-hand side, then click "Leave the Contacts preview." When you do that, you'll automatically be redirected to the old Contacts site. From here, click the check box near the top of your screen to select all of your contacts. Next, click the "More" drop-down menu, then choose "Export" from the list. From here, choose "Selected contacts" on the popup, then make sure to select "vCard format." Once you've done that, simply click the "Export" button, then a .vcf file will be saved to your downloads folder. Step 2: Import Your Contacts to iCloud Next up, head to iCloud.com online, then log in with the Apple ID you use on your new iPhone. From here, select the "Contacts" option. After that, click the gear icon in the bottom-left corner of the page, then select "Import vCard." Next, use the file browser menu to select the vCard file you downloaded from Google Contacts, then click "Open," and your contacts will be imported momentarily. Step 3: Sync Contacts to Your iPhone If your newly-imported contacts don't show up on your iPhone within a few minutes, head to the main Settings menu, then select the "iCloud" entry. From here, enable the "Contacts" option, then wait a few minutes for your contacts to finish syncing. If it's already enabled, toggle it off and back on again.

Hibernate OGM now supports Infinispan datagrid over Hot Rod Posted by Sanne Grinovero    |    Nov 8, 2016    |    Tagged as Hibernate OGM Releases Infinispan Today we release Hibernate OGM 5.1.0.Beta1 and 5.0.3.Final. In version 5.1 we introduce an amazing new feature: support for storing data in Infinispan Server using the Java Hot Rod client, encoding your data into Google Protobuffers, while handling all the nasty mapping automatically. Hot Rod support? Hot Rod is the protocol used by "intelligent clients" of an Infinispan Server, which implies the client is smart enough to implement a series of performance optimisation tricks; for example it is able to connect to the most suited server in the cluster depending on the data being requested (or written), greatly reducing the latency of operations. While Infinispan is most known as an high-performance key/value store, when it comes to remote clients the recommended approach is to encode your data in Google Protobuffers. This allows for evolution of your storage schema without breaking decoding of existing data, allows server side queries and functions to interpret the stored data, and allows interoperability with Hot Rod clients from other programming languages. It allows for example to read the POJOs we write using the Java client from a Python client, and have the data converted into reasonable Python Objects. Unfortunately dealing with an Hot Rod client can be tedious! It’s a key-value store: manual handling of object relations is error prone You’ll need to write and maintain a matching Protobuf Schema for all your entities You’ll have to setup Protostream and configure it as Marshaller for the Hot Rod client Most importantly, it requires new skills. You’ll have to learn how a Protobuf Schema is best defined, and how to use Protostream. Finally, you’ll have to learn the Hot Rod API and how to make the most of its advanced flags to tune each operation, and consider carefully how you want to represent relations. Use something familiar instead? Hibernate OGM can automate the tedious parts, and let you focus on what matters: storing your objects. Add this dependency: <dependency>

        </persistence-unit>
</persistence> 1 Choose Hibernate OGM as JPA Provider 2 pick infinispan_remote as datastore 3 include Hot Rod configuration properties, just replacing/adding the OGM prefix. Start Hibernate OGM! EntityManagerFactory emf = Persistence.createEntityManagerFactory("ogm-with-hotrod"); That’s enough to create Hibernate EntityManagers which knows how to perform CRUD of your model, encoding and decoding your data into Hot Rod! This will: Start and manage the Hot Rod client, have it initialize connections to your Infinispan Server Generate an appropriate Protobuf Schema for your model Deploy the schema to the Infinispan Server Initialize all the internal Protobuf encoders and decoders using Protostream Properly implement sequences / autoincrements (a feature lacking in native Hot Rod) There are some limitations. The most notable one is that you will have to manually create the Cache definitions that it will need on your Infinispan Server configuration, as at this time this is an operation which can’t be performed over Hot Rod (but the friendly Infinispan team is working on a solution). Another limitation is that at this time we don’t support running JPQL queries on this backend. You can find many more interesting details in our Infinispan integration reference guide; I’ve included a section to help you choose between Infinispan Embedded and Infinispan Remote (over Hot Rod). Of course many more fixes made it into this release; for a full overview see the 5.1.0.Beta1 changelog. Hibernate OGM 5.0.3.Final We also released Hibernate OGM version 5.0.3.Final, to address a single mapping issue: many thanks to Simone Manetti for reporting OGM-1198, now resolved in this version. Here is the full 5.0.3.Final changelog. If you need to upgrade from a version before 5.0, you can find help in the migration notes. What’s next? Version 5.1 is feature complete now.

Photograph: Andrew Gombert/EPA Trump’s victory over Hillary Clinton concludes one of the most bitter political contest the country has ever experienced – one marked by a deep mistrust of both candidates, two visions for America separated by a vast gulf, and resurgent strains of racism, sexism and Islamophobia. This is the divided country that faces Trump as he steps into the presidency. Clinton is still, perhaps, projected to win the popular vote. But with Republicans retaining control of the Senate and the House, Trump is well-positioned to act upon the promises that were the focal point of his campaign. A crackdown on immigration into the United States. A wall that spans the entirety of the US border with Mexico. A focus on white working-class regions of the country, conservative nominees to the supreme court, and a protectionist trade stance. And a combative position on the world stage, including a belligerent relationship with many longtime foreign allies. On that note, we are closing the Glass Ceiling Watch blog.

A couple of hours later, things have swung steadily in Trump’s direction. I’m at a different watch party, at the Wing, an upscale women’s member club in Manhattan; it’s starting to feel less like a party and more like group therapy. Many of the well dressed women here seem to be in the process of biting their nails off. Audrey Gelman and Lauren Kassan Photograph: Arwa Mahdawi for the Guardian “I don’t think I can eat or drink anything,” says one woman, flustered, standing in front of a slick bar covered in pizza slices and bottles of wine. “I’m too nervous.” “I want to ask Nate Silver, whose website I’ve been checking religiously, why his methodology is so flawed,” Audrey Gelman, co-founder of The Wing tells me. There’s a collective sense of incredulity, almost anger, that the polls were so wrong. Gelman says she’s “frightened” by the prospect of a Trump presidency, particularly considering the disturbing “levels of vitriol and misogyny in this campaign.” Still, she says, she’s comforted by the fact that she’s in this space, “surrounded by hundreds of women.” Inside The Wing Photograph: The Guardian If Hillary loses will it set women’s rights back? I ask Lauren Kassan, co-founder of the Wing. Kassan doesn’t think so; “women are going to come together more than ever and it’s why [women-only] spaces like this are even more important.” The Virginia call comes in and, shortly after, it’s announced that Clinton is still projected to win. A big cheer goes up. You can practically feel the tension break. The volume in the room goes up. People start eating the pizza again. No one is getting too comfortable though. It’s very clear that if tonight ends in a victory for Hillary it’s going to have been a lot closer than anyone predicted.

Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 10.25pm EST 22:25 Here’s how hard it is to become president when you’re a (fictional) woman Turns out it’s pretty unusual for a woman to be president of the United States in the fictional world, too. There are only a handful of examples, and most of them involve exceptional circumstances. The most common reason in fiction a woman becomes president? The men have died. Here are a few standouts: Mars Attacks! When this 1996 space invasion movie opens, Taffy, played by a 14-year-old Natalie Portman, is the president’s teenage daughter. Then, Mars attacks. By the time Earth defeats the aliens, the entire federal government is dead, and Taffy appears to be the president. Which, sure. That’s totally how that works. Commander in Chief In this short-lived ABC series, America got its first female president when the sitting president, a dude, died of an aneurysm. Geena Davis played Vice President-turned-President Mackenzie Allen. Battlestar Galactica “The most common reason in fiction a woman becomes president? The men have died.” Photograph: Allstar/SCI-FI CHANNEL On a planet that looks a lot like Earth, in a country that seems a lot like the United States, Education Secretary Laura Roslin becomes president after an artificially intelligent species from outer space launches a surprise attack on humanity. (OK, so our worlds are slightly different.) The attack kills off all but a few hundred humans, and Roslin, one of the few survivors from civilian government, becomes our first female space president. Y: The Last Man Sometimes, every man on the planet has to die before a woman can become the president of the United States. You know how it is. In this dystopian comic series by Brian K. Vaughan, Agriculture Secretary Margaret Valentine becomes the president after a mysterious force kills off almost every human with a Y-chromosome. The scourge places Valentine next in line for succession. Later in the series, Valentine wins reelection because Oprah wasn’t available. (Really.) Honorable mention: Air Force One When Russian terrorists seize control the president’s plane and hold his family hostage, you would expect the vice president to take the wheel. Just for a few hours, so Harrison Ford has the space he needs to body-slam those terrorists off his plane. But in Air Force One, when members of the government urge Vice President Glenn Close to declare the president – WHO IS A HOSTAGE – unable to perform his duties, she refuses. C’mon girl.

Self-driving cars are well on their way, and many tech companies are focusing much of their attention on artificial intelligence. Here's how big these two trends could get. Chris Neiger (TMFNewsie) Nov 8, 2016 at 11:29AM Image source: Getty Images. IHS Automotive predicts that just 20 years from now, nearly 10% of all new vehicles sold will be fully self-driving. Tesla CEO Elon Musk said last month that all of the company's new cars built from now on will ship with fully autonomous hardware (though the features won't be activated yet). Clearly, we're headed toward a very different automotive future then any of us grew up with.   But just as important -- and likely more so -- we're also leaping further into an artificial intelligence (AI) future. Research firm Garter wrote last month that, "AI and machine learning have reached a critical tipping point and will increasingly augment and extend virtually every technology enabled service, thing or application," and it calls AI a "primary battleground" for tech companies through at least 2020. There are some clear opportunities for investors to benefit from driverless cars and AI as both trends gain steam. At the forefront of these trends are tech stalwarts Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), as well as new leaders like Tesla and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA). Betting on artificial intelligence  It's easy to assume AI is just science fiction, but it's already here in may practical ways. Alphabet's Google uses AI to serve up more relevant search results, and identify and categorize images in the Google Photos app. CB Insights says the company has been one of the biggest AI investors over the past few years.  Google has purchased 11 AI companies, more than any other tech company, all for varying purposes. Its purchase of DNNresearch in 2013 helped with the company's search functionality, and the purchase of DeepMind two years ago has helped make the company's servers much more energy efficient. And Alphabet believes the same technology "will also help other companies who run on Google's cloud to improve their own energy efficiency." After Google, Facebook is making some clear gains in AI. Earlier this year, the company addressed the market by saying it wants to build 1.5 billion AI agents, or "one for every person who uses Facebook or any of its products," according to the company's head of Applied Machine Learning group, Joaquin Candela. That means Facebook is using AI to better serve relevant content to its users, all through its own in-house system called FBLearner Flow. Essentially, AI can do things like identify spam messages, determine which Facebook user is in an image, and make decisions on which posts and ads you see.  Like Google, Facebook is making AI acquisitions as well, but it has also established its own AI research team that's trying to teach computers predictive learning. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said on an earnings call in 2013 that one of the company's main goals is "to do world-class artificial intelligence research using all of the knowledge that people have shared on Facebook." Gartner says the "old guard" may not be the first movers in the AI space, but rather smaller, more nimble, start-ups. Perhaps that's why Google, Facebook, and other larger tech companies are investing so heavily in AI. Since 2011, 140 AI companies have been bought up by larger companies, and 40 of these have happened this year alone.  Google and Facebook are betting that their early investments will give them an edge in the rapidly expanding AI market. IDC expects global spending on cognitive systems to reach $31.3 billion by 2019 and grow at a compound annual growth rate of 55% over the next five years. And with their acquisitions and own in-house research, Google and Facebook are in a prime position to benefit. Driverless car pursuits There are plenty of hurdles for driverless cars (I've outlined a few here), but even with those potential problems, IHS Automotive estimates the technology will become ubiquitous some time after 2050. Getting to that point will take incremental steps, and Tesla, NVIDIA, and most recently Qualcomm are taking bigger leaps than nearly any other company. Telsa's driverless car ambitions are anything but elusive. CEO Elon Musk has said that he wants to have fully autonomous technology in Tesla cars by 2018, and the company just made a big step in that direction last month.  Tesla said in a press release just a few weeks ago that from now on, all of its cars in production will come equipped with fully autonomous driving hardware. To be clear, they won't drive themselves yet. Instead, that hardware will collect data from the cars and help Tesla build out a stronger semi-autonomous system.    "Before activating the features enabled by the new hardware, we will further calibrate the system using millions of miles of real-world driving to ensure significant improvements to safety and convenience," the company said. To help with its driverless car goals, Tesla recently partnered with NVIDIA. Tesla's new in-vehicle supercomputer is powered by the NVIDIA Drive PX 2 AI computing platform, but NVIDIA is also making its own moves into driverless cars. NVIDIA's Drive PX 2 supercomputer pairs with sensors and cameras to give vehicles situational awareness and interpret the information around them. Using the company's high-end GPUs, Drive PX 2 can take visual information and interpret how the car should respond based on what it sees.  Drive PX 2 is already being used by 80 different automakers and Tier 1 auto suppliers, and the recent addition of Tesla is sure to help solidify the company's place in the driverless car market.  Finally, there's Qualcomm's latest automotive tech move. The company recently announced its plans to purchase automotive tech leader NXP Semiconductors. That's a smart move considering NXP holds a commanding lead in the automotive semiconductor market, with 14.5% market share.  Aside from chips, NXP had also released a semi-autonomous driving system, called BlueBox, before Qualcomm made its bid. BlueBox is comprised of sensors, cameras, a computer, and complex algorithms that allow companies to quickly bring semi-autonomous features to their vehicles.  Boston Consulting Group says the market size for partially and fully autonomous cars will reach $77 billion by 2035, which is why the companies above are so eager to grab an early lead in the space right now. The verdict These two tech trends aren't exactly an apples-to-apples comparison -- in part because driverless cars won't be possible without continual developments in artificial intelligence.  For that reason, there isn't a clear winner between these two trends, but there is one company likely to benefit from both. NVIDIA has its hands in both developing GPUs and AI for driverless cars, but also in selling its chips to Facebook, Amazon, and Google to help power their AI systems. For that reason, I think NVIDIA will continue to be both a strong AI and driverless car investment going forward, and it should give long-term investors a solid chance to win big on both tech trends.  Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

It was a humble beginning, not without difficulties. I was born to a single mom. I had an absent father. My mother (Jean Boone) worked very hard at multiple jobs. I have an older brother (Kevin). It was definitely a context of struggle growing up. My mother was a nurses aide. Despite working tirelessly, she was always supportive, the source of stability and a great sounding board. Despite a challenging set of circumstances, she always had a positive and uplifting outlook on life. She imparted that to my brother and me. That's been incredibly valuable. She set the example of hard work, tenacity and perseverance. My brother and I internalized the importance of hard work, focus, tenacity and perseverance. Even though from a material perspective it was a difficult time, there was lots of love. Love can compensate for a lot. Were you in leadership roles growing up? I was the president of the student council in elementary school. (Laughs) It was an elected position. That was in sixth grade (Windsor Hills Elementary School in Baltimore). In high school, I was president of the Debate Society. I was a leader in the Afro-Latino-American Society. That was the minority group at Andover. My lucky break was winning a full scholarship to Andover, which took me out of Baltimore at the age of 13. Tell me about your lucky break. A huge amount of life is hard work and taking advantage of opportunity, but there is also amazing serendipity and luck. I happened to be enrolled in Roland Park, a citywide magnet school for junior high school. Marie Bessicks was a guidance counselor at Roland Park. I still stay in touch with her. In the 1980s, Andover and Exeter were trying to diversify their student bodies. They were recognizing that bringing in diverse populations would expand the power and reach and impact of the education that they were providing. They targeted large magnet schools, like Roland Park. Marie Bessicks took a handful of us and shepherded us through this incredibly rigorous and at times confusing and intimidating admissions process. I got accepted to Andover and Exeter with full scholarships and decided to go to Andover. If I think about role models and leaders at Andover, Bobby Edwards was critical. He was also African-American and a dynamic person who had very high standards. The instructors at Andover always were pushing us to try new things and take leadership roles. It was a tough challenge to leave inner city Baltimore and go to a place like Andover. It was such a radically different context. It was good for me to have that experience so early, because the way I dealt with it was to embrace the sense of possibility. I graduated from Andover in 1987. I went to Stanford undergrad and majored in economics. In my early career, I had the good fortune to work at Bain & Company. I worked with really strategic and thoughtful and empathetic and authentic leaders. Phyllis Yale, a partner at Bain, was a mentor and someone I worked closely with. Kim Ogden, also a partner there, was important to my development – she kept pushing me. Chris Bierly was another partner who taught me. I left Bain in 1993 for my MBA at Harvard. Let's say a young person comes to you and says they have a shot at leading their company. How would you advise them to prepare? The most important element in that preparation is demonstrating outstanding results and impact. You have to show up and deliver and deliver exceptionally well beyond expectations. Second is making sure that you round out your skill set and the things you're exposed to, such that you have a broader set of tools and perspectives to help you deliver against the challenge of the specific job or opportunity. You need to have not only expertise, you have to have some intuition around other elements you're responsible for so that you know the right questions to ask. Figure out what you don't know and surround yourself with people who can help you. Don't focus on one narrow lane of activities. Get that rounded perspective. A big part of leadership is inspiring people. Move into situations where you are called on to lead teams. Those teams can be small in the beginning, but you have to learn how to motivate and inspire and orchestrate teams such that you can take on increasing levels of responsibility. And your advice for someone assuming a leadership role? The first piece of advice would be to have a vision. Leaders are called on to set a vision and inspire a group of people around that vision and give them the cover and guidance to deliver on it, and ideally exceed or expand upon it. Setting a vision is critical. In a leader, authenticity is important. There are all different types of leadership styles. There are all different types of effective leaders. But a consistent thread is authenticity, showing up as a full and complete and complex and transparent individual. Transparency doesn't mean everything has to be revealed at all times. That's not appropriate either. Leaders understand when to filter things. Authenticity is connected to another important characteristic: Self-awareness. It's very hard to be an authentic leader and to inspire people and set a vision if you don't have a baseline level of self-awareness and if you haven't invested time and energy in knowing what your values are. Then, you have to focus on people and their development. It has to be about them and about how you are enabling them to exceed their own expectations and to do things they never thought were possible. Focus on your team and the people and what they need, not only professionally, but personally. How does a leader get their team to do things that they never thought were possible? You have to set an ambitious vision. In many ways, set goals that might appear unreasonable. At Google, we have this notion of 10X thinking or moon-shot thinking. You don't focus on the incremental. You focus on the logarithmic or the exponential. If you set ambitious goals, it forces people to step outside of their comfort zone and what they think might be possible. Then you have to be a good coach. You have to be invested in people's development so that they feel like you're taking care of them. Your main motivation is getting them to that point where they feel they can make that leap. There's a lot of foundation laying that has to happen to make people feel secure and confident that you're going to help them get there. Google is famous for change and innovation, so what is your advice for someone leading an organization through change? As a leader you have to set the expectation that the only thing we know in life that is constant is change. It's the one thing we know for sure that we know will happen: Things will always change. At Google, we have that mindset that our world is constantly evolving. We are not in a state of inertia and stasis. As a leader, set the expectation that change and the pace of change are constant and increasing. That habituates people to expect that things will be different. So much of leadership is expectation setting. If you have that expectation it makes leading through change a lot less difficult. The other important thing of leading through change is just exceptional and transparent communication. How do you keep people informed so that they're not operating in a vacuum? People tend to make assumptions and fill information vacuums, typically with inaccurate or unconstructive assumptions. So the more you can close those vacuums by being open and transparent. Google is probably one of the most transparent cultures out there. That helps a lot. "CNY Conversations" feature Q&A interviews about leadership, success, and innovation.

And while you can’t vote online — or via text message — there are a host of tech companies that have developed tools to make the process easier — from finding the nearest poll to making informed decisions. Google: A voting-related doodle on Google’s homepage serves as a constant reminder to vote every time you use the search giant. Clicking on the doodle directs you to a “where do I vote” search page to find the closest polling location. Twitter: Sending a direct message on Twitter to the handle @Gov will also surface polling locations. People can chat with the @Gov bot to find out more about individual candidates, ballot measures, or find a different polling location. Facebook: Don’t have Twitter? No problem. Facebook also has a tool to help people find the nearest polling spot. Go to the “Elections 2016” tab on the left column. Enter the address where you’re registered to vote and Facebook will connect to a third party site to map the closest location. Facebook also has a host of different tools on its Elections page, including voting ID requirements, ballot previews, and of course, an option to share that you voted and encourage friends to do the same. HelloVote: Those who registered to vote using chatbot HelloVote will receive reminder text messages. The bot will also surface polling location info, transit and driving directions, state ID requirements, weather notifications, social sharing (including an “I voted” selfie feature). People can also give feedback on their polling experience. And, Hillary Clinton’s campaign has set up a hotline to answer voter questions themselves in real time. People can tweet or DM @HFA on Twitter, or text “Question” to 472-46, and her team will reply. CNNMoney reached out to Donald Trump’s campaign to see if it has developed any similar tool and will update when it responds. Uber: The ride-sharing company is teaming with Google to tell riders their polling location, and easily request a ride there. In Pennsylvania, voters can use the promo code “VOTEPA” to get a $15 credit on a ride to the polls, and $15 on a ride home, courtesy of My Ride to Vote. Voters in North Carolina and Florida can text “Go Vote” to 73179 to get a free Uber ride, thanks to Rock the Vote and Voto Latino. Lyft: As America gears up to elect its 45th president, Lyft is giving a 45% discount on one ride on Election Day in the following markets: Atlanta; Baltimore; Boston; Charlotte; Chicago; Dallas; Denver; Detroit; Miami; Minneapolis-St. Paul; Nashville; New Orleans; the New York-New Jersey metro area; Philadelphia; Phoenix; Portland, Oregon; Raleigh; San Diego and Washington D.C. For a totally free Lyft ride, voters in Pennsylvania, Ohio, North Carolina, Florida, Texas and California should text “Go Vote” to 73179. Zipcar: For last-minute voters, Zipcar is making 7,000 vehicles around the country free for its members from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. There are also tools to make sure that once you get to the polls, voters stay hungry and hydrated.

By Darah Hansen November 8, 2016 Vice Media has partnered with Jawa Pos TV and Google on a deal that will see the Brooklyn-based media company and content studio deliver digital and linear programming to the Southeast Asian country. Vice Indonesia, based in Jakarta, will produce and distribute both local and international content aimed at wooing the country’s growing millennial and Gen Z demographic, estimated at more than 100 million people. As the media co has done in other countries, Vice Indonesia will work with young Indonesian producers, creators, editors and photographers offer programming in specific genres, including culture, food, music, technology and sports. Under the collaboration with Jawa Pos TV, an Indonesian TV news network, Vice will launch its daily news offering, Vice News Tonight, in a primetime slot. Select programming from its fledgling television channel Viceland will also air on the network during primetime. The company released no further details on the programming slate. Google’s involvement will see the creation of Searchlight, a digital offering showcasing Indonesian youth culture and nightlife, with the aim of reaching a global audience. The expansion into Indonesia marks Vice’s fourth Asian operation. The company already has a presence in Japan, China and South Korea, with plans to launch full 24-hour Viceland channels in 18 Southeast Asian territories. Vice, ESPN reveal content deal details Elsewhere, Vice unveiled the specifics behind its previously inked production and distribution deal with ESPN. Under the deal, blocks of the Sal Masekela-hosted Vice World of Sports began broadcasting across ESPN2 Nov. 7, running through to Dec. 8, with episodes touching on such topics as college football’s Bayou Classic; the effects of warming relations between the U.S. and Cuba on the island’s baseball players; a Ugandan soccer league in the country’s only maximum-security prison; and New Zealand twin runners living in Iten, Kenya. ESPN2 also debuted Vice Sports’ hour-long special The Clubhouse (pictured, right) – exec produced by NBA player Carmelo Anthony – Nov. 7. The brand serves as a platform for short documentaries for athletes to share stories that transcend sports while offering an exclusive look into an issue affecting not only the athlete, but the global community at large. The previously announced agreement allows for Vice Sports to produce original content for ESPN and Vice’s various digital and linear platforms, while ESPN’s Emmy-nominated doc strand 30 for 30 began airing on Viceland Nov. 4. Cayman Grant and Joe Lavine’s Playing for the Mob, documenting Boston College’s point-shaving basketball season in 1978-79, is slated to premiere across Viceland on Nov. 11 at 10 p.m. ET/PT. Also scheduled to premiere under the 30 for 30 banner are Daniel Gordon’s 9.79*, chronicling the scandal behind the 100 meter race at the 1988 Seoul Olympics, on Nov. 18 at 10 p.m. ET/PT; Jonathon Hock’s Unguarded, detailing the rise and fall of high school basketball standout Chris Herren, on Nov. 25 at 10 p.m. ET/PT; and Cody and Chike’s Benji: The True Story of a Life Cut Short, about the short life and 1984 death of Chicago high school basketball player Ben Wilson, on Dec. 2 at 10 p.m. ET/PT. Together, Vice Sports and ESPN Films will create a number of original, short-form series to run across both companies’ properties. with files from Daniele Alcinii TAGS:ESPN, ESPN 30 for 30, ESPN2, Google+, Jawa Pos TV, The Clubhouse, Vice Indonesia, Vice Media, Vice World of Sports, Viceland Top Stories People/Biz A.

Having access to the company’s automotive software has required one of two things thus far: either buying a car with a compatible infotainment system, or buying and installing an aftermarket head unit that was compatible. Either choice is a pricey proposition, and not always practical for newer vehicles. By making Android Auto a standalone app with 2.0, Google is aiming to bridge that gap when just about every vehicle make and model leading up to 2015 has no hope of ever getting it from the automakers. When was the last time you updated your in-car infotainment software? And if you did, what did it get you? Doing it this way addresses a major problem regarding safer smartphone usage in the car. An overwhelming majority of vehicles on the road have no access to Google’s automotive platform, but for those with Android phones, 2.0 is a free download away. The basics In its current form, Android Auto is software that resides on an Android phone and projects to a compatible head unit in the car. The phone needs to be running on 5.0 Lollipop or later to run it, an existing compatibility requirement for the app too. Using a platform designed for 7-inch (or larger) displays looked and felt different on a phone like the Pixel XL and its 5.5-inch screen, comparatively speaking. The phone needed to be mounted on a vent, the dashboard, windshield, or a holder attached to the 12-volt socket to be visible and reachable for touch input. Plugging it in to charge was also smart because of how much battery life the app needs. If your car has a dedicated USB port for smartphones, plug it into the one that isn’t, so as not to confuse the infotainment system into thinking you prefer a wired connection over a wireless one for the app. Bluetooth isn’t necessary to run it, but does make things much easier when audio can stream to the car stereo. Despite being in a car that is 10 years old, I was fine because I have a Pioneer aftermarket head unit installed with Bluetooth functionality. An alternative is to plug the phone in to the Aux-In input and have audio run through that. Adding a Bluetooth earpiece for calls would cover all the bases. Unfortunately, tablets aren’t part of the mix here, which feels like a major omission. Google’s reasoning is in focusing on hands-free calling and messaging, where SIM cards generally slot inside phones, except tablets have larger displays that would make the platform look more natural. Either way, a tablet version of the app isn’t available on Google Play. Mind you, do-it-yourself setups are always possible, like mounting an Android tablet somewhere on the dash to run the app. The primary need at that point is to have a hotspot or in-car Wi-Fi for the tablet to connect to, unless you already have a working SIM slotted in for data. Connectivity and layout Setting up the app is essentially the same as it would be if tethered to a compatible system. The step-by-step guide is basic, and the app does need permissions access to things like the phone, messaging and location to plug in to those features. The layout is also the same, save for some minor differences. The familiar card layout is front and centre, while the menu options are moved to the side to make room (they are at the bottom for the in-car version). They do shift to the bottom when running the app in portrait mode. App settings are on the top left, with Google Now activation on the microphone icon on the top right. A circle home button is an exit out of the app and back to the home screen. Making the platform entirely mobile not only liberates which vehicle it runs in, but also who can control it in the car. A passenger can handle the music playlist or seek out directions by taking the phone in hand. The static location of the in-car platform made it accessible only to the driver and front passenger, whereas even those sitting in the back can participate when need be with this app. Under normal circumstances with the tethered in-car setup, the phone is all but disabled, but here, the app is entirely functional from the handset itself. Indeed, I was able to set up navigation routes at home before I even left to drive somewhere. Google Now is integrated, but not Google Assistant. Once the Pixel XL started running the app, saying “OK Google,” did nothing. Not even Now popped up to attention waiting for a command. As is consistent with the in-car verison, tapping the microphone button opens up Now for calls, messages, mapping or music playback. The Assistant platform running on Pixel phones is currently silenced whenever the Android Auto app runs, so if you’re looking for it to recite a poem or tell you a joke, it’s not happening. There’s no word yet on when that integration is going to happen, but it’s a safe bet that Google won’t miss an opportunity to flick that switch eventually. Things get a little mixed when it comes to how the app integrates with in-car controls. For example, I could switch tracks or adjust volume using the buttons on my head unit, but if I had steering wheel controls, I’m not sure I would be able to activate Google Now or initiate a call that way. My car doesn’t have steering wheel controls, so I can’t be sure. Once I get the chance to try it in a car that does, we will update this review to reflect that experience. In the car Looking at a 5.5-inch display for contextual information while driving wasn’t always practical. Large fonts and icons help simplify getting around the app, and the responsiveness of the Pixel XL’s display was noticeably faster than on many infotainment screens I’ve tested. As I mentioned earlier, searching and setting up navigation routes before getting into the car was one of the most valuable time-saving features. Granted, this was already possible with Google Maps anyway, because the in-car Android Auto platform would know the most recent search queries. The difference here with the app is that the sequence feels almost instant. I’m waiting in line to buy dinner at one venue, and as a test, I sought a route to another particular destination. Once I approached the car, I started navigation and it informed me on traffic conditions, along with whether the venue would be closed by the time I arrived. In other words, I didn’t have to be in the car to set anything up. It’s a usage pattern that permeates the whole app. I could navigate Spotify, Google Play Music, TuneIn Radio or compatible podcast and audiobooks apps in advance, limiting actual input once I started the engine. On that point, Google has embedded a safety feature to briefly pause input after a series of touches — something that can’t be turned off. The settings offer some handy options. If running on a data connection, I could have Wi-Fi turn off automatically once the app started running. I could create my own auto-reply message for incoming calls or texts. Pocket detection waits until the phone is out of pocket or bag to start the app. One of Android Auto’s inherent strengths, especially compared to Apple’s CarPlay, is the relative depth of third-party app compatibility. Messaging apps, like Hangouts, WhatsApp, Telegram and Kik are supported. Skype works, but it won’t do video, only audio calls. Various music apps, some that may not be popular in North America, are available, but some are certainly recognizable, like Deezer, Stingray and djay. The absence of Waze still feels like a gaping hole. Google Maps is fine, but having some flexibility on the mapping front would be appreciated. Hopefully, Google commits to its promise to launch it before year’s end. The overall list of compatible apps hasn’t grown this year as one might have expected it would, but at least the level of choice is a little varied. Here’s hoping traction speeds up next year. Google Now If you’ve used Android Auto before, you won’t find any real surprises here. Voice commands are basically the same as they’ve always been on the platform, only now that Google Assistant has debuted with the Pixel phones, I wanted that level of intelligence to work in the car. Not that Now isn’t serviceable, because it is. It’s just that Assistant is better at recognizing commands, and offers deeper integration. All told, that would make Android Auto easier and safer to use. As is, though, Google didn’t mess with anything. Provided the phone can hear you, it will respond to a command as best it can. I asked it for the score in a hockey or basketball game, and it obliged. I dialed a number or sent a message, and it went smoothly. The basics are covered, but more is always appreciated when safety is paramount in a vehicle. It would also be nice to bring Now to life purely through voice. I tried many times, and couldn’t make it happen with the 2.0 app. Wrap Up Even if Android Auto 2.0 is a veritable clone of the original in-car platform, the result is worthy on its own. In-car infotainment is a fragmented mess that will take years to unravel, and with hardware installs very limited in newer, more complex vehicles, a universal methodology like this makes a lot of sense. Android as an operating system is equally fragmented. A report from Statista found versions from 5.0 Lollipop or later made up 53.7 percent of the market as of September. The release of 7.0 (and 7.1) Nougat is too soon to impact that number further upward, but only slightly more than half of Android users will have access to the app. The 2.0 app will be released in the 30 countries where Android Auto is already available, including Canada. Statista didn’t break down its figures by country, so later versions of Android may be more prevalent here than in other countries. The point is that this is a free and easy way to improve smartphone integration in a vehicle, sticking closely to the original layout. For any user who can download and run it, Android Auto 2.0 is worth trying out. Related: Android Auto review Hssphaily I love this update, it was much needed. Vineet Sharma Nice move Google Caspan So to me this is a great step to what I have been asking for for years. Let me mirror my screen to my head unit. Head unit companies are 5 years behind the curve. If they could make a port on the head unit that was HDMI and touches on the screen were sent own the HDMI cable. I get in my car I plug my phone into a little slot in my car or the center console. boom your car is not a smart car.. and even better in the future we can do this wireless over Bluetooth! EddieWinslow Happy to see this. My truck that I purchased said Android Auto was coming soon. It is Nov and still no word on it. So being able to use it without the need to wait for Ford to update to support it is a relief. the_truth_07 Hi Eddie? which truck are you referring to? We bought a Chevy Colorado with the promise of Android auto coming soon, and while we recieved no notification that it was ready/installed, I tried my phone about a month a go, and it worked perfectly! EddieWinslow F-150. I am waiting for the Sync 3 update that supports Android Auto. Still no function for it. If I bought the truck after July it has the functionality. Quite annoying. Caspan Where do you get the app, i went to Play Store and its the old version? orangedude Google “Android Auto 2.0 apk”, you’ll find it right away. Caspan side load only for now , gotcha !! orangedude I’ve installed the .apk on my tablet last night (an LG G Pad 2 LTE with an active SIM and data plan), and it works perfectly. To keep the phone call connectivity, I actually connect my phone over Bluetooth to my OEM dash unit and use Spotify’s remote play feature (where you can control another device and play the music on it). The tablet controls what song plays on the phone, and the phone plays through the car’s Bluetooth Audio. The only thing I don’t get is the navigation voices channeled through the car speakers, though I rarely, if ever, turn that on anyway so that’s something I can live with. TomsDisqusted You shouldn’t omit the ongoing issue of ‘avoid tolls’ since it affects GTA residents more then most. For those that don’t know about this, the 407 toll road is a very expensive but very useful toll road in southern Ontario that some people use a lot – and get a transponder – but most people only use in emergencies. With Google Maps and Android Auto, you must drill down through the menus and turn on the ‘avoid tolls’ option every single time you use navigation or directions. Obviously this is difficult and dangerous to do while driving. Originally, on Android Auto you had to stop the car to do this, which means you had to remember to do it and setup your navigation before you left home. Obviously, that is mind-boggling stupidity compared to eg. what Google did on iOS where Maps simply remembers your preference! And this has been a high profile issue of Google Maps for more then five years but Google has simply not gotten around to making the option sticky on Android. Recently AA added the option to set ‘avoid tolls’ by voice, which is not nearly as good as simply fixing the problem in the app, but is a big step up and makes AA usable for those near the 407. If that is not also available to users of AA in this new mode then AA is pretty useless for those who live near the 407. thereasoner You can make avoiding toll roads permanent by toggling off toll roads in the settings and the press ‘save settings’. TomsDisqusted No, I believe ?that is not correct. I just checked maps (don’t have AA handy) and there is no change. Besides if they fixed this it would be huge news in the Android community so I would have heard about it. Did you mean AA or maps on Android or both thereasoner When my Son moved to Guelph Google Maps would always plot a route on the 407. I remember going into route options and selecting avoid tolls then save and I’ve never been directed towards the 407 since. Perhaps it has to be done for each specific destination ? Maybe, in case of emergency, Google Maps defaults to the fastest route otherwise unless specified by the user. Andrew_notPorC Did you save the route as a shortcut? Andrew_notPorC If Google wanted to make Maps really awesome, they could add a prompt when setting up a destination “would you like to use tolls roads to save x minutes for an estimated cost is $y?” I find that most of the time, taking 407 might save me 2 or 3 minutes at a cost of $10-20. Sean Walton It’s not working on my 2015 Honda Civic EX. I plug my S7 in via USB and stupid Mirror Link takes over. I try to disable Mirror Link on my S7 in connection settings but it turns right back on due to the USB cable being plugged in. Any ideas folks? Ted K If you have a second USB port, try that one. If that doesn’t work, try disabling MirrorLink on your car’s infotainment system, rather than the phone. Or you can only connect to the system via Bluetooth and use AA 2.0 that way. Sean Walton I tried the other usb port and same issue. I can’t figure out how to disable MirrorLink on my 2015 Civic. I’ve looked everywhere online with no luck. I connect via Bluetooth but nothing displays on my infotainment system. This stupid MirrorLink is blocking everything. So frustrating. Zach Gilbert Nothing will display on your car infotainment system. The phone becomes the screen for your in car infotainment and displays Android Auto on itself. Sean Walton Oh okay. I thought I could get it on my infortainment screen. Well this sucks then. Why would I use AA then? My music already plays through bluetooth and before going somewhere I use Google Maps Navigation and it interupts my music to tell me when a turn is coming up etc…. Zach Gilbert There are a few other features like the app integration. But as a whole, some people may find it better to use their car system instead. Scott Urquhart Hi Ted, Thabks for looking into the issue. I tried your suggestion, and yes it does play if the app is previously open, but after a few minutes it will go into a buffering mode again, and the stop playing. If I exit Android Auto, I am able to get TuneIn to play again without issues. Scott Jefferson Won Why it doesn’t support Nexus 7 (2013)? I know it’s aging but it would be a good placement for my car without any touchscreeen whatsoever.. 🙁 and nexus 7 has gps too Smanny Only the LTE version Scott Urquhart One problem I have found is with TuneIn radio. I initiate Android Auto, then attempt to listen to TuneIn radio app, but it never connects. I close Android Auto, and I can get TuneIn to work no problem. I listed to TuneIn every day while driving so I would give up Android Auto to keep listening to it. I can ‘t be the only one ? Ted K I tried to replicate your issue with TuneIn on Android Auto 2.0 and found it worked just fine each time. So long as you’ve launched the native app beforehand, you should be good to go. Nicolas Racine This is a great update. Can’t wait to try it! BTW, how do you display gas price on your screen? Ted K Thanks for your question. If you tap the search icon while in a map, it will give you the option to search for gas stations, grocery stores, coffee shops or restaurants along your route.

It’s offering the handsets in a variety of colors but the one that customers liked the most was the one it calls Really Blue. This color is a temporary U.S. exclusive and it was the first to sell out when pre-orders were opened. The Really Blue Google Pixel hasn’t really been back in stock since but the company has now said that it’s going to have additional stock to sell to customers in the very near future. This is great news for customers who have been waiting to pick up a Pixel but were not able to because the color that they wanted to buy wasn’t available. Google has confirmed to the folks at AndroidPolice that contrary to popular belief that the first wave of Really Blue Pixel handsets marked an end to this color option, it’s going to restock this option on the Google Store soon. Customers who are interested in buying a Pixel handset in Really Blue can use the online store’s waitlist function to be notified automatically when it’s back in stock. The company didn’t whether the second wave is going to be enough to meet the demand so we’ll only really get to know that once the color option is back in stock. Google is yet to provide an exact date for that. Filed in Cellphones. Read more about Google.

Next year's German federal election will likely be the country's first data-driven campaign, and some lawmakers are worried. By Marcel Rosenbach Marcel Rosenbach E-Mail: marcel.rosenbach@spiegel.de Mehr Artikel von Marcel Rosenbach DPA German Chancellor Angela Merkel speaking to media professionals in Munich November 08, 2016  04:31 PM Print Feedback Comment Angela Merkel has been talking about the Internet a lot recently. Just last Tuesday, for instance, while addressing important figures from the TV and publishing industries, she discussed the power of companies like Facebook and Google -- more specifically, the secret algorithms they use to sort search results and to present custom news feeds to users. The problem, Merkel argued, was that no one outside of these social media giants knows what criteria they use to filter data. It's not only problematic for political parties, she said, but for society as a whole. The chancellor's sudden interest in the nuances of IT policy was related to one thing: Germany's upcoming federal election campaign. Merkel knows that Facebook and Google could play an important role in deciding who's going to lead the country after the vote, which is expected to take place in late 2017. When it comes to digitalization, not only German industry has had to reinvent itself -- the business of politics has also been turned upside down, especially during campaign season. But far fewer people pay attention when technologies disrupt the political landscape than when they change our economy. Should we really be afraid of the power of algorithms? Can Facebook and Google secretly influence the way we form political opinions and affect the outcome of elections? Could Google's preferred candidates be given an unfair advantage? The answers to these questions are unequivocal: Yes they can; and yes they are. Facebook's wide reach alone makes the social network an important tool for shaping, or manipulating, other people's opinions. With around 1.8 billion users, it is the global mass medium of our era. In Germany, Facebook has close to 29 million users, more than 22 million of whom consult it every day. That's a quarter of the country's entire population. Google's numbers are just as impressive. With over 90 percent of all search engine traffic routed through its servers, a modern-day gatekeeper like Google has an historically unprecedented influence over its users' lives. Even the order in which results appear on a search page can have a huge impact, affecting how well a product sells, for example, or making or breaking a candidate's ranking in the polls. These days, online platforms have significant influence on our political awareness and they don't even deny this is true. They market their power quite openly: Advertising revenue from political parties and candidates is all part of the business model, and Google and Facebook specifically target political leaders to win them over as customers. Facebook, for example, has hosted special workshops in Berlin for politically active Germans, and the social media network published a German-language "Guidebook for Politicians and Office Holders," which advertises and explains "political campaigns on Facebook." In the most recent edition, from March 2016, the authors use case studies to explain what data-driven campaign strategies can accomplish. Facebook can be leveraged to target users' specific political interests. In February of this year, for example, there were 44,000 people in Germany between the ages of 25 and 50 interested in the issue of minimum wages. Depending on the size of the advertising budget, some, most or even all Facebook users "who meet the defined criteria" could be shown a party's or candidate's advertisement. Politicians, for example, can target people who have "liked" their pages, as well as all of their friends -- or all people in a certain age range, such as first-time voters who live close to their electoral offices. Great Power, Great Responsibility Facebook is proud of its success. In its "Guidebook," it even touts the victory of the British Conservative Party in 2015 as evidence of what its data-driven campaigns can do. The company says it played "a decisive role" by reaching out to target groups about the issues they cared about, especially in districts with close margins. The four-month campaign, they claimed, was the first time a party in Europe had "used Facebook ads in such a sophisticated and targeted manner." In Germany, many fringe groups and far-right political parties have used Facebook to attract and mobilize supporters. Even Pegida, the xenophobic protest movement that began in Dresden, started as a Facebook group. But paying to court specific voters online is only one of many ways to exert political influence -- and not even the most problematic, given its similarities to election posters or TV commercials. What bothers Merkel -- and many other politicians around the world -- are the subtler forms of influence. At the media conference in Munich, the chancellor criticized the fact that algorithms latched onto previously articulated interests and simply presented more of the same. The effect, she said, only exacerbates people's entrenchment. Other critics fear that social media networks run the risk of becoming hidden political actors, ones that not only use their influence to make money but also to change the course of entire elections -- without anyone knowing. Since they regard their algorithms as business secrets, they are protected from the prying eyes of regulators. Facebook knows some of its users so well that it has extremely clear notions of their political leanings. Characteristics such as age, friends, place of residence, pages visited, among many others, help the company to categorize them politically. The "Like" button is also a big help. People who "like" the fan pages of Angela Merkel and her party, the Christian Democratic Union, aren't very likely going to vote for the Left Party. In the United States, Facebook openly organizes people into one of three categories: "liberal," "moderate" or "conservative." Some scientists are worried that Facebook could manipulate elections by intentionally mobilizing certain groups of voters. For years, the social networks have been sending its users' reminders to go out and vote before elections and plebiscites, calling upon them to make use of their right to vote and take part in democracy. But what if during the next election, Facebook were to only send such reminders to certain people who, based on their interests, age or place of residence, were highly likely to vote a certain way? What if Facebook began only mobilizing members of certain political movements? During the US Congressional election in 2010, Facebook activated voting reminders on 61 million users' newsfeeds. A joint analysis with researchers from the University of California revealed that the social network was directly responsible for boosting voter participation by 340,000 people. In close races, that could be more than enough to swing the outcome. Companies like Facebook could "flip an election," the Internet researcher Kate Crawford told SPIEGEL ONLINE. But such "enormous power" also comes with "substantial ethical questions," she added. Neutral or Not? A recent US study investigating Google's potential influence on electoral decisions came to a similar conclusion. For 20 percent of undecided voters, Google's search algorithm had the power to change the way they voted, the study found. The scientists spoke of a "search machine manipulation effect." Both Google and Facebook insisted they were not driven by a political agenda and maintained neutrality. "Facebook would never try to control elections," the social network's chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, said in 2014. Google, for its part, claims it has never altered search results to force one electoral outcome or another. "If we were to stray from that principle, people's trust in our company would be undermined," the company said in a statement. But even the possibility of unintentional or practically uncontrollable influence over a democratic election is dangerous. It would also be naïve and negligent for policymakers to rely entirely on the internet giants' promises of neutrality. There are legitimate doubts to be had about the networks' self-proclaimed neutrality -- and never before have they been so loudly projected as during the US election cycle that comes to an end on Tuesday. The Trump camp in particular has bemoaned a liberal bias for Hillary Clinton. One source of their frustration was a leaked screenshot that showed a Facebook employee asking Mark Zuckerberg: "What responsibility does Facebook have to prevent a President Trump?" Obviously there was never a doubt as to the company's capacity for doing such a thing. The influence of Google and Facebook goes way beyond election campaigns. Indeed, the people in charge of their algorithms are constantly making decisions that are politically relevant. Politically controversial material, for instance, is often "censored." Recently, an alliance of more than 70 civil rights groups complained that Facebook was regularly deleting posts that documented human rights violations. The networks are also using their power to promote their own political concerns. Back in 2012, when Google launched a petition against a planned anti-piracy law, 4.5 million people signed it in a single day. The initiative was a shot across Washington's bow, a show of Google's power. Google and other opponents of the measure ultimately got their way. Is Germany about to have its first-ever data-driven election campaign? Every major German party has sent observers to the US to learn from the Democrats' and Republicans' social media teams. Back in Germany, however, Facebook has an image problem: It is, above all else, associated with hate speech. Many lawmakers and ministers are faced with hateful online messages every day. Now, Facebook is trying to combat its poor reputation with a classical advertising campaign: in newspapers and on TV.

It can therefore only be welcomed, when people have other sources of information outside the channelled form of thought we are expected to follow. Not without reason, did the free-thinking people of Europe (including many Germans), listen to BBC broadcasts during the Second World War. Now it is possible to follow a wide version of opinions and factual reports from all around the world. Many may be absurd, but at least it gives us a chance to think for ourselves, without the politically biased weighting to be found in the German media.

There’s really no other purpose to the base other than just improving the look of this device. It doesn’t add any additional functionality to Google Home. Google is currently offering six bases for Google Home through its online store. Three come in metal and the others in fabric. They have been designed to blend in well with their surroundings and enable owners to change the look of Google Home to suit their preferences. The fabric bases for Google Home cost $20 and they are available in purple, orange, and teal. The metal bases cost $40 and they are available in copper, snow (white), and carbon (black finishes), they look quite similar to the base that Google Home already ships with. The bases magnetically attack to Google’s smart speaker so it’s very easy to change them as and when you please. Google does point out that it’s selling the bases exclusively through its online store so you can’t find them anywhere else. Filed in Gadgets. Read more about Google and google home.

Even President Barack Obama has been involved, reminding people to vote in an in-app Spotify message. “Millions of Americans are voting,” the president intones in a short clip that directs listeners to Headcount.org for voter information. “You should be one of them.” It’s all part of a push to get Americans out to vote in what has been one of the ugliest and most bitterly fought campaigns in recent memory. The tension has been so fierce, Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump didn’t even shake hands before two of their three presidential debates. The tech efforts come as some polls show Clinton with a slim lead over Trump. So every vote, including yours, counts. Google on Monday said it would deliver election results in more than 30 languages. The search giant said that in addition to the marquee presidential race, the results will include state-level referendums and ballot propositions, as well as congressional and gubernatorial races.

Live streaming coverage will be available throughout the day on CBSN and CBSNews.com. Since late October, Facebook has been offering a feature to help members develop voting plans tailored to their states. The social network is using data gathered by the nonpartisan Center for Technology and Civic Life to compile how the candidates stand on the issues and who’s endorsed them. It also offers recent social media posts and campaign websites for review. Facebook also lets you email copies of your voting plan to yourself to print and take with you to the voting booth. (Some states won’t allow using your smartphone while voting.) On Sunday, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the social network had helped more than 2 million people register to vote. “Voting is one of our great responsibilities as citizens in a democracy,” Zuckerberg wrote. “That’s why you’ve probably seen us actively encouraging everyone who can vote, to go vote.” Likewise, Twitter is reminding voters to participate in the process. Voters can direct-message @Gov to find their closest polling place and ballot information. On Monday, the social media platform said some one billion tweets about the election had been sent to this handle in the U.S. since the primary debates began in August 2015. #ElectionDay is almost here!

Resend activation e-mail Gear & Gadgets / Product News & Reviews “Android Extensions” could be Google’s plan to make Android updates suck less Google might soon have a way to back port some AOSP features to old versions. by Ron Amadeo - Nov 8, 2016 2:52 pm UTC Login to bookmark 72 Apple bragged about the speed of iOS 10's rollout at the company's Mac event in October. Apple Finally, a whopping two-and-a-half months after the release of Android 7.0 Nougat, the Android 7.0 Compatibility Definition Document (CDD) has been published. The CDD is Google's list of rules for Android OEMs that want to ship devices with the Google Play Store and other Google apps. While Android is open source, most of Google's apps are not, and licensing Google's apps means agreeing to a contract called the Mobile Application Distribution Agreement (MADA) and passing Google's "compatibility" tests, which ensure the device can properly run Android apps. The updates to the 85-page Compatibility Definition Document are mostly about codifying the new 7.0 features so OEMs don't break anything, but there are a few interesting tidbits. The one we're going to focus on now is the mysterious mention of "Android Extensions." There's a whole new section, which reads: 3.1.1. Android Extensions Android includes the support of extending the managed APIs while keeping the same API level version. Android device implementations MUST preload the AOSP implementation of both the shared library ExtShared and services ExtServices with versions higher than or equal to the minimum versions allowed per each API level. For example, Android 7.0 device implementations, running API level 24 MUST include at least version 1. "Extending the managed APIs while keeping the same API level version" sounds a whole lot like what Google Play Services does today. You have the base Android operating system, and Google Play Services is a layer that sits on top of the OS. Play Services provides a bunch of Google APIs, giving developers access to various Google Services. Because Play Services is just an APK (an Android app file), it can be easily updated via the Play Store. This means that regardless of how indifferent your OEM is to updates, Play Services can always be updated directly by Google. Today on a production Android device there are two main API sources for developers: the AOSP (Android Open Source Project) APIs included in the base OS, and the proprietary Google APIs included in Google Play Services. Play Services is an easily updatable APK, while the AOSP APIs require a full OS update, which for non-Google phones can be a nightmare of roadblocks and approvals. Enlarge / The current "layout" of Android, to the best of our knowledge. We might soon have to add a new column to this called "Android Extensions." We have a theory: "Android Extensions" is a plan to bring the easily updatable app model to the AOSP APIs. Like Google Play Services, we think this app will be a bundle of API shims that Google can update whenever it wants. The difference is that everything in Play Services is a closed-source Google API, while "Android Extensions" would be collections of fresh AOSP code delivered directly to your device via the Play Store. The CDD's stipulation that OEMs "MUST preload the AOSP implementation" is telling. It says that 1) this is AOSP code, and 2) OEMs aren't allowed to "customize" it. The CDD even helpfully calls out the specific files. It references "shared library ExtShared and services ExtServices," and sure enough, there are two new APKs on Android 7.0 devices called "GoogleExtShared.apk" and "GoogleExtServices.apk." After taking a look at the two files on the Google Pixel and LG V20, we can say that today they are...mostly empty. Specifically, GoogleExtShared.apk is almost totally empty. It has no UI, no permissions, no images, boilerplate Java code, and a single string that identifies the app as the "Android Shared Library." GoogleExtServices has an app name of "Android Services Library" and does actually contain something: an "Android Notification Ranking Service." A "Notification Ranking Service" was added in Lollipop, and it sorts notifications by "importance" based on things like freshness, app type (IM apps come first), and by contact. This seems to be an extension to the system that includes support for Nougat's "notification bundling" feature. This is a really minor feature, and with only this single chunk of code, GoogleExtServices weighs in at a microscopic 10KB. The shape of things to come So if these two files are pretty much empty, why does the CDD demand that both files be preloaded in all 7.0 devices? The answer is probably because we'll eventually see these "apps" show up in the Play Store. Being preloaded means if updated versions did come to the Play Store, the Play Store client would find them and automatically install the updated versions. Preloading placeholder apps basically ensures Google can "install" these at a later date, when they're ready. Being empty fits with our theory that these files will be for backporting future AOSP features—they're empty now because fresh versions of the OS just shipped, and Google hasn't yet developed any out-of-cycle features to backport. If our theory is right, the real question going forward is how extensively these two APKs will be used by Google. Google Play Services 1.0 didn't do much when it launched in September 2012, just rolling out support for OAuth 2.0 and a few Google+ APIs. However, over the following years it grew lots of other APIs. Here is our best guess at what these two files will eventually do once the updates come out: "GoogleExtServices" sounds like the AOSP counterpart to Google Play Services. It will bring new APIs to developers, with proprietary Google APIs living in Play Services and AOSP APIs living in "Extended" Services. "GoogleExtShared" is identified as a "Shared Library," a feature that lets programs share common bits of code, usually from a third party. For instance, nearly every Android app today includes the Android Support Library—another collection of shims that allows newer Android features to work on older operating systems. Android doesn't support shared libraries today, so the Android Support Library is bundled with most apps—it wouldn't be crazy to have 50 copies of it on your phone, all at various versions. Shared Libraries would allow for a single instance of the Android Support Library on a device, which every app could access. There will always be a gap between what a full OS update can do and what updating a set of APKs can do. Right now, though, with Google Play Services as the only "API shim" app, Google's update setup has the odd stipulation that easily updatable code must also be proprietary Google code. There's no reason Google can't use this "app-style distribution" to ship open source code just as easily, and so far the evidence suggests these two "Android Extension" APKs could be a path toward that.

Pocket-lint Sections Apps Cameras Cars Drones Fitness Trackers Gadgets Games Headphones Laptops Parenting Phones Smart Home Smartwatches Speakers Tablets TV VR News Reviews Features Deals YouTube Instagram Facebook Twitter Google+ search Phones Best Phone Cameras Fitness trackers Parent hub Smart home EE Pocket-lint Awards YouTube HDR video: Everything you need to know about YouTube's latest feature Elyse Betters7 November 2016Apps Pocket-lint Facebook Twitter Pintrest LinkedIn Google+ Mail Comment Google-owned YouTube now supports HDR (high dynamic range) content. With HDR-compatible televisions bursting onto the market, and several other media companies (such as Netflix and Amazon) offering HDR content, many consumers are likely wondering what's going on with YouTube and how they can start watching funny cat clips in HDR. Here's everything you need to know about YouTube's HDR plans, including what HDR means. YouTube HDR: When will HDR be available on YouTube? At CES 2016 in January, YuTube said it planned to support the latest innovation in video: HDR. Robery Kyncl, the company's chief business officer, quietly revealed the news during on-stage discussion about 360-degree video experiences, which YouTube also supports. It took YouTube 9 months before it rolled out HDR for all. On 7 November YouTube confirmed it officially supports HDR videos, which it said have "higher contrast, revealing precise, detailed shadows and stunning highlights with more clarity than ever... Simply put, HDR unlocks the most spectacular image quality we've ever streamed". In other words, starting now, you can watch YouTube videos in HDR on supported devices. YouTube HDR: What does HDR mean? As we mentioned already, HDR stands for high dynamic range. The technology basically improves video image quality by expanding contrast ratio and colour palette. The result is a more realistic and natural image with richer colours, brighter whites, deeper blacks, and plenty of detail for dark, shadowy scenes. The format is informally considered the next step beyond HD TV. There's a lot happening in HDR television right now, from streaming services, to gaming, to inclusion on the latest Ultra HD Blu-ray discs as well, so you'll have heard a lot about it. Pocket-lint has an in-depth guide that details everything you need to know about HDR and the different standards available, including their technical specs. What is HDR, what TVs support HDR, and what HDR content can I watch? YouTube HDR: What types of HDR content can you watch? At launch, you'll be able to watch HDR content from YouTube creators who made their own HDR videos using HDR-capable cameras (just like you can do now with 4K videos and 360-degree videos from YouTube creators), and you may be able to rent HDR movies from YouTube, although the company has not confirmed whether this type of offering will be included with HDR support. From a YouTube point of view, this is going to be very much about the creators and the type of content that they choose to create, but HDR is especially useful for things like sunsets, high contrast and high colour scenes. YouTube HDR: Who can upload HDR videos to YouTube? Any creator can upload HDR videos to YouTube. To learn more about uploading HDR videos, go to Google's Support page. Google said it's been working with the "DaVinci Resolve team" to make uploading HDR just as simple as SDR videos. YouTube HDR: How will you find HDR videos on YouTube? Google said viewers can confirm HDR playback when a video is played if they see an "HDR" badge along with player controls. For the time being, Google is promoting this playlist of HDR videos made by YouTube creators who worked with Google ahead of time. YouTube HDR: What do you need to watch HDR on YouTube? You can only watch HDR on a HDR-compatible display. Vizio, Sony, Samsung, Panasonic, LG, TCL, Hisense, and every other TV manufacturer you can think of now sell HDR TV sets. Sony's new PS4 Pro and Google's new Chromecast Ultra can also output HDR video. If you are using Chromecast Ultra, you'll be able to find the YouTube video on your phone and cast it, viewing in HDR and 4K, if supported in the video. For those devices, you'll likely need an update to the YouTube player on that HDR-compatible device. YouTube has already confirmed that this is coming to Samsung's 2016 SUHD and UHD televisions, so if you happen to have one of those, you're likely to be the first in line to get support. If you're using a device that doesn't support HDR, you will still see the video, but it will be a standard dynamic range (SDR) video.   Sections Google YouTube Apps Best UK Black Friday and Cyber Monday 2016 deals Amazon Music Unlimited explained: Price, devices and how to get it Which is the best music streaming service in the UK?

They’re covered in hydrophobic and antimicrobial coating to ensure they don’t degrade due to atmospheric humidity or any other damaging factors.

Record » Tuesday Nov082016 Google to Offer Live Election Coverage Tonight Tuesday, November 8, 2016 at 8:52AM Stay informed on election day. As soon as the polls close on Tuesday, Nov. 8,Google   GOOG 2.69%  will display continuously updated election results through its search engine the company said. The search giant plans to show up-to-the-minute information detailing the progress of multiple U.S. election day races and other referenda to anyone who queries for “election results.” Google said it would deliver the updates every 30 seconds in more than 30 different languages, according to a blog post by Shashi Thakur, vice president of engineering on the Google search team. Included in the briefings are the presidential, senatorial, congressional, and gubernatorial races, as well as other ballots throughout the U.S. Here’s a glimpse of what the search tool should look like, per the blog post: The rundown includes real-time statistics on the matchup between Hillary Clinton, the Democratic contender for the White House, and Donald Trump, the Republican candidate. Alongside details of the tug-of-war for the executive office are key numbers concerning open legislative seats, battleground states, and the top two political parties (blue for Democrats, red for Republicans). Although this is not the first time that Google has offered informational tools during an election, this year marks a notable increase in the company’s efforts to meet consumer demand as more people turn to the web—and increasingly their smartphones—for news. Google said that it had seen traffic for the search term “how to vote” more than triple in the past four years, up 233% from 2012. In addition to the political précis that will appear on election day (above), Google has already debuted tools detailing how to register, how and where to vote, and info on who is running—including an election-themed Google Doodle. Google said that YouTube, its video division, would stream live coverage from a number of news outlets as well, including NBC, PBS, MTV, Bloomberg, Telemundo, and The Young Turks starting at 7 p.m. ET on Tuesday. “From the ballot box to tomorrow’s late-night returns, we hope Google’s tools help guide you through Election Day in a simple, clear and informative way,” Thakur said.

Written by Kanishka Singh | Updated: November 8, 2016 7:08 pm US Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. (Source: Reuters) Democrat Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has picked up the lead in terms of most searched presidential candidate on the search engine Google barely hours before America votes. Hillary took over Republican candidate Donald Trump as the most keenly searched candidate on the Internet’s most widely used search engine. On November 8 midnight, the search density on Google stood equal with 48 per cent of candidate interest going for Hillary and the same for Trump. The rest was divided between other candidates Gary Johnson, Jill Stein and Evan McMullin. Hillary’s videos are also being watched around 8-10 per cent more than Trump’s on YouTube. WATCH VIDEO: US Presidential Elections 2016: Voting Underway In Many States At 11:30 am IST, for every 66 searches for Hillary, Trump was clocking 53. Hillary led throughout the day, not dropping behind Trump at any time. Trump was leading Hillary two days ago but on Monday their popularity on Google came to equal footing and on Tuesday Hillary took off. Overall search density charts show that people in Oceania are searching for Trump more than any demographic region, even more than America. Similarly, Africa is searching most for Hillary, more than even the US. Read | US presidential elections 2016 LIVE: First ballots cast in towns of New Hampshire Interestingly, only 9 out of 50 states in the US are searching Trump more than Hillary. These states are are Nevada, Colorado, New Mexico, South Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Indiana, West Virginia and Vermont. Only 12 states are searching for economy as top election issue. At least 29 are searching abortion as their top issue. The top trending related searches for Trump in the US did not include election issues. Rather, they were regarding his alleged assassination attempt, rushing him off the stage at a rally, his Twitter handle, Reno and the secret service. Similarly, the top trending related searches for Hillary in the US included NYPD over its stop and frisk rights, Hillary becoming the unsafe hand, Beyonce and Hillary spirit cooking. According to latest trends data available for November 6, electoral issues clubbed with candidates found interesting trends in searches outside the US more than in the US. According to Google trends data, when analysing Hillary’s searches clubbed with electoral issues, China and Japan are searching Trans-Pacific Partnership–a trade pact that Trump wants to scrap. Oceania is searching more than any region for ISIS and abortion. The region also tops charts for interest in abortion policy of Hillary followed by the US and Europe. Black Lives Matter polls highest in the US with Hillary while Europe is most interested in her foreign policy. Americans searched most for Hillary’s economic policy, healthcare, global warming and gun control plans. US searches topped global charts for her plans on same sex marriages as well as oil. WATCH VIDEO: US Presidential Elections 2016: Here Is The Full Process   US searched most for Trump’s policies on abortion, black lives matter, economy, healthcare, oil and refugees. Oceania led the searches for Trump’s policies on same sex marriages, Brexit, global warming, gun control, ISIS and racism. Europe was most interested in his foreign policies in line with his plans to make more alliances in Europe. Trump was popular in searches before the first presidential debate. After the first debate, his popularity dropped. The vice presidential debate helped revive some popularity on the Internet. But after another rise and fall in the other two following debates his position weakened. Hillary gained massive ground after she received the clean chit from the FBI. Previously, Hillary Clinton’s related searches included mostly her emails, email server, indictment, FBI probe etc. Now the searches have changed to her presidency. On the web domain, Hillary seems to be moving ahead of Trump. We can only wait to see if that translates into votes as well.

The price of the two phones is similar. The Google Pixel XL costs Rs 67,000 while the iPhone 7 Plus sells at Rs 72,000. This is for the 32GB models of the two phones. If you opt for the version with more internal storage, that will costs more. So, the price difference between the two phones is Rs 5,000. But frankly it is not that much in the ultra-premium segment. Rs 5,000 is less than 10 per cent of the price of the Pixel XL as well as the iPhone 7 Plus. Anyone willing to spend Rs 67,000 can also easily spend another Rs 5,000 if it makes sense. And it does make sense. In many cases. And yet, it doesn't. Here is how I can break it down, to keep it all simple. And this is based on my experience with these two phones for over two weeks. Reasons to buy the iPhone 7 Plus 1- This is the best iPhone ever, although the iPhone 7 has a better and more compact design. But the iPhone 7 Plus is built like a tank and its finishing is absolutely premium. In terms of build quality, it is definitely better than the Google Pixel XL. Although, the Pixel XL fits in hands better and is comparatively easier to use with one hand. Did I say that the iPhone 7 Plus is the best iPhone ever? So if you are an iPhone fan - if you use an iPhone and are satisfied with it -- go for it instead of the Google Pixel XL. Also Read: 5 reasons why Google Pixel XL can be the best phone for you 2- The performance of the iPhone 7 Plus is more reliable. Although, it has animations that seem to drag on, even if they are slick. But once you get used to those animations and understand that unlike Android where stuff happens in a snap even if there is some lag here and there, the iPhone animations are look slower. But the performance itself is good and reliable. Games not only look great but also run smoothly. Similarly, scrolling through web pages and switching between open apps is all very smooth. There is no jerkiness. More significantly, this is the kind of performance, you can expect from the iPhone 7 Plus even after one year of use. At least that has been the track record of Apple with other iPhones and I don't see any reason for a change with the iPhone 7 Plus. 3- The Portrait Mode on the iPhone 7 Plus is absolutely fantastic, even if technically the Pixel XL camera is superior to the iPhone 7 Plus main camera. With this mode you get the closer to the subject and you get really nice blurred background. Also, the iPhone 7 Plus camera seems more sure of a scene when it clicks photo. This means accurate exposure almost all the time and accurate white balance compared to what Pixel manages. It gives great results with minimum fuss. Also Read: Google Pixel could have beaten iPhone 7 but 3 reasons why it can't 4- The video shooting on the iPhone 7 Plus is class leading and better than what Pixel XL can manage. 5- Apple has a tendency to support the iPhones for four years with software updates. This kind of makes the iPhone 7 Plus Mr Dependable. You buy it ones, Apple then takes care of it for years. 6- Apple iPhone 7 Plus has a screen that shows more accurate colours. And it has a wider colour gamut, which not all will appreciate but those who have finer -- and more subtle -- taste in colours will find very pleasing. 7- The iPhone 7 Plus has better speakers, partly because it has stereo speakers. But stereo or no stereo, the iPhone 7 Plus sounds fairly sweet for a phone. 9- The iPhone 7 Plus is water and dust-proof. Kind of big deal, and particularly so if you are often clumsy with your phone. But again, this is one factor where it all depends on how much weightage you give to this feature. 10- The iPhone 7 Plus has a better selfie camera Reasons to buy Google Pixel 1- Compared to the iPhone 7 Plus, the Pixel XL is just more smart. The Android Nougat aka Android 7.1, in terms of functionality and features, is a better operating system than the iOS. It is easier and quicker to do things with the Android, whether we are talking about the web browsing or just editing a photo in an app like Snapseed before sharing it on Facebook. Also, Android is more flexible and that makes it feel more versatile. You can set what apps open which content. You can access content at a file level. You can copy-paste stuff across apps. You can share stuff between apps with an ease that is not there on the iOS. The notification system is better and the notifications you get don't crowd your phone's lockscreen the way they do on the iPhone. The list goes onâ€¦ Android is definitely better. 2- Google apps and services are great on Pixel XL. The whole Gmail, Maps, and Google Now experience is better on the Pixel XL. This is particularly true for India, where Apple Maps is not good and where the Google Assistant is more useful than Siri because it understands the Indian accents so well. If you use Google services a lot, the Pixel XL is a better phone for you. 3- If you are into absolute image quality and often edit your photos, even the photos shot with the phone, get the Pixel XL. Also, the Pixel XL is a superior camera compared to the iPhone 7 Plus in low light. It captures amazing HD photos with dynamic light. 4- If you like your phone's screen full of contrast and punchy colours, you will like the Pixel screen. 5- If you already use a Nexus phone and like it, you will definitely love the Pixel XL. And chances are you won't like the iPhone 7 Plus. So go for Google's phone. 6- If you want a phone that is easier to use with single hand, go for the Pixel XL. Although both the iPhone 7 Plus and the Pixel XL are phones with 5.5-inch screen. 7- If have a set of earphones that you use interchangeably - different in office, different at home, different in gym - go for the Pixel XL. On the iPhone 7 Plus, you will have to carry an adapter. A few other things to note -- Although Google may not offer the 4 years of software updates to Pixel XL - or maybe it will, who knows  -- it is promising two years of official software update. For many users that may be enough. Also Read: Pixel XL and iPhone 7 Plus vs DSLR cam: You can't tell the difference -- The battery life of both the phones is similar. It is around 14 to 16 hours with fairly heavy use, where you are on the phone and internet almost all the time. In terms of charging speed, the Pixel XL is slightly faster but none are as fast as the OnePlus 3 with its Dash charger. Also Read: Google Pixel XL vs OnePlus 3: It's closer than it should be -- Neither the iPhone 7 Plus, nor the Pixel XL offer support for microSD card or dual SIM. Although Pixel XL comes with unlimited (full-resolution) photo backup. So you can always move your photos to Google servers and free up space on the phone. -- Apple has a proven record of good aftersales service. Google is yet to prove itself on this matter. The Pixel XL and the Pixel are the company's first phones. -- Whether you hope to buy the Pixel XL or the iPhone 7 Plus, finding one in stock may prove a bit cumbersome. These phones are on low stock right now. -- Finally, if I am buying I will get the Pixel XL because I like the way Android does things and I don't mind editing the images that the Pixel XL clicks. It's just that I am so much faster when I am using good Android software. The keyboard. The notifications. The way web pages scroll. The way information can be moved between apps. All of this helps me work faster. But at the same time, if one of my less tech-savvy friend is asking for a phone, I will recommend the iPhone 7 Plus. It's just more reliable. Lastly, let me add that both the Pixel XL and the iPhone 7 Plus are good phones. But whether they are great or not depends on what you are seeking in your next phone. The reasons to pick the iPhone 7 Plus or the Pixel XL are listed here. Now choose wisely. Also Read: iPhone 7 Plus camera can surpass a DSLR camera.

LG beats Samsung to Nougat, rolling out OS update to G5 phones 0 Share: Mobile by Daniel Van Boom November 7, 2016 9:24 PM PST @dvanboom Up Next Fantastic Beasts' Dan Fogler sees magic in tech Enlarge Image Photo by Josh Miller/CNET LG is stepping up its Android game, on Tuesday beginning the rollout of Android 7.0 Nougat to the G5. That makes the G5 the first non-Google phone to receive the update. Meanwhile, the recent Google Pixel and LG's V20 were shipped with Nougat. LG said G5's in South Korea will get the update first, with the Americas and Asia getting Nougat "in the weeks to come." Samsung, meanwhile, will begin a public beta test for Nougat on its Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge phones beginning on Wednesday. Google's new operating systems have until now launched with Nexus phones, like last year's 6P, while other Android users have had to wait months until their phone manufacturer and/or network carrier pushes out an update. Nougat brought with it new features like the Google Assistant, Instant Apps and better multiwindow support.

Twitter Facebook Google+ LinkedIn Instagram YouTube RSS Skip to content SEO News Content Marketing Social Media Paid Search Work Life Events Advertise 5 Remarketing Lists to Boost PPC Ad Performance Paid Search October 27, 2016 Paid Search Ben WoodOctober 27, 2016 763SHARES 2.7KREADS 763SHARES 2.7KREADS Ben Wood 763SHARES 2.7KREADS Remarketing lists for search ads (RLSAs) allow Google AdWords users to customize search network campaigns to target users who have completed a desired action on their website. This targeting can allow advertisers to target a specific audience already familiar with the brand, while leveraging budget to maximize ROAS. In this post, I will outline 5 actionable uses of RLSAs that will allow you to influence your search network targeting and modify bid strategies on AdWords based on audience lists that can easily be created within Google Analytics. 1.Increase Bids for Users That Have Visited Your Site an Optimal Number of Times Before Purchase Within Google Analytics, you can view the split of conversions by number of channel interactions. This data is available in the path length report, in which you will be able to view how many conversions and the value of conversions split by the number of sessions the user has had before making a purchase. This data can be extremely useful for modifying bids on Google AdWords. For example, a bathroom retailer might find that their most profitable website visitors visit their site twice before making a purchase. In the example above, you can see that the biggest chunk of revenue is generated from users who visit the site for a second time before proceeding to make a purchase. With this in mind, we could increase bids for users who have visited the site only once previously but not yet made a purchase. To enable us to target these individuals in Google AdWords, we would firstly need to create an audience list in Google Analytics > Admin > Audiences: Here you would specify that the user must have had at least one session but not yet completed a transaction: The next step is to apply this list to your existing ad groups in your AdWords account. You can do this in AdWords Editor or the AdWords interface, under the Audiences tab: I would recommend applying this list using the Bid Only option. Using the Bid Only setting gives you the option to set bid adjustments if the person searching is a member of your RLSA list. You can learn more about this setting here. 2. Turn High-Value Seasonal Customers into Repeat Buyers Every year Black Friday seems to turn regular shoppers into a frenzied mob of bargain hunters. In addition to in-store madness, customers will often purchase online from retailers for the first time on Black Friday because the offers are simply too good to refuse. Using RLSAs, you can increase bids for Black Friday shoppers who made high-value purchases on Black Friday, in an attempt to bring them back to your site for additional purchases in future. For example, consumer electronics retailers such as Currys run huge discounts around Black Friday, so they could increase bids for users who spent more than £350 in a single transaction on Black Friday, when those users are searching for other products they stock later in the year. To create an audience list based on a specific date, you would need to visit the conditions tab in the Analytics audience creator. To target high-value Black Friday customers, you’d enter the session date as the 27th November 2015 (Black Friday last year) and the revenue per session > (more than) the average order value – in this case we have entered a value of £350. Again, I would recommend applying this list to existing ad groups using the bid only option in AdWords. This will allow you to increase your bids whenever high-value Black Friday customers are searching for keywords included within those ad groups. 3. Increase Bids for People who’ve Completed a Micro Conversion but not yet Made a Purchase This is one list that I’ve found particularly useful for clients who have set up micro conversions in Google Analytics. Micro conversions are classed as activities that website visitors engage in before making a purchase. For example, activities such as signing up for an email newsletter, creating an account or downloading a PDF would all be classed as micro conversions. This tactic will allow you to increase bids for users that have already completed a micro goal on your website whenever they are searching for keywords that you’re targeting. For example, Mercedes could increase their bids for users that have previously interacted with their finance calculator (micro goal), but not yet completed a contact form to request an appointment at the dealership (macro goal). Creating this audience list is relatively simple. In the audience list > conditions section within GA admin, filter users and set the macro goal completions as zero, and the micro goal completions as at least one, as shown in the screen grab below: Again, I would suggest applying this to existing ad groups as a bid only strategy in Google AdWords. 4. Target People who Spend Over Your Average Order Value This remarketing list will allow you to adjust bids for users that have generated a high conversion value for you historically and could help you avoid losing customers to your paid competitors. For example, online grocery retailers could identify shoppers who spend more than their average order value on their monthly or weekly shop. They could utilize RLSAs to increase bids for users searching for generic terms such as ‘buy groceries online’ or set up a campaign to target and bid on competitor terms whenever users within the list are searching. This tactic can be particularly effective in industries where consumers aren’t very loyal and often flick between different retailers due to convenience, as you can boost visibility whenever high-value customers are searching for competitors. You can create this list in the Enhanced E-commerce section within the Google Analytics audience builder. You could apply this list to existing ad groups as Bid Only to increase your bids whenever these users are searching for generic terms. Also, you could create a campaign containing competitor brand names and apply this list as Target and Bid, so your ads would only be triggered if the user searching for your competitors has previously visited your site and made a high-value purchase. 5. Customize Search Network Targeting via Google Customer Match Google Customer Match lets advertisers upload and target email lists via AdWords. Using customer match, you can upload email addresses to AdWords via the Audiences tab. Google will then match these email addresses with any Google accounts that share the same email address. Once your lists have been uploaded and matched with Google accounts, you will be able to target and modify bids for selected ad groups in the audiences tab: Like all remarketing lists, you will need to have a minimum of 1,000 list members for your list to be eligible for use on Google search. This figure relates to the number of email addresses in the uploaded list that are registered for a Google account. So to be eligible for targeting in Google AdWords, at least 1000 of the email addresses you upload must match an email address registered for a Google account. A few of my clients utilize customer match to advertise loyalty programs for their existing customers, when previously the only way of communicating these schemes was via email, direct mail or telephone. For example, if you’re running a discount for all customers who have registered for an account, you could advertise this discount on your search network ads by setting up an ad group referencing the discounts and adding your email list using the ‘target and bid’ option so that they will get visibility of your discounts when searching Google. Conclusion RLSAs offer a wealth of potential targeting opportunities and can help get the most out of even the smallest of advertising budgets. So, if you’re not already using remarketing lists to customize your search network targeting, I strongly recommend giving a few of these tactics a try. Have you already used RLSAs? If so, please comment below to share your tips and tactics. Image Credits Featured Image: WD net / Pexels Screenshots by Ben Wood.

I have been reading more and more into RLSA lately and so far seen really good results. For example, increasing bids for existing customers. Although this is very simple, i have seen a 20%+ conversion rate from this on non branded terms, solely using the bid only target. Although RLSA is very powerful, i would only utilise this through the bid only method due to time spent creating ad copy, finding broad words of which to target etc. I would rather put my time into making actionable optimisation into my main campaigns. Conclusion: I really like RLSA but i couldn’t justify using a full campaign on it, utilising audiences works best i believe. Thanks Ben!!!! Ben Wood Thanks Terry! Ankit Prakash Hi Ben, This is something new to me, although I have been using PPC AdWords from past eight years, this is something new to me. I would like to apply this to me and later for my clients. Thanks a million, great post.

The NextWeb had a great story saying that Google has redesigned its developer policies with clearer language and visual examples. Normally, I don't just parrot what the tech blogosphere publishes, but it's an important enough API message that I think it warrants repeating. In my experience, API providers just emulate what they hear in the space and stories like this need amplification. What Google did isn't rocket surgery. They just simplified the legalese around what they expect of developers. What better way to actually help ensure these best practices around the platform actual happen than by actually providing simple titles, summary description, images, and other relevant links on a developer policy page? In most scenarios, developers aren't malicious; they are just usually ignorant of the best practices that often exist in the platforms legalese we agree to, but seldom ever read. My friend Tyler Singletary stated: The organization here for policy is fun, mostly clear, and interactive. A company the size of Google distilling the deep TOS policy into such a user and developer friendly front end is pretty astounding. I agree. Simple like this, when you operate at Google scale can be pretty hard, and is something I'd love to see standardized across Google offerings.  I will be adding any of the elements from the simplified Google Play developer policy that are missing in my API terms of service, privacy, licensing, and branding research. I will also add the concept of having visuals for each area, or building block, and add the common theme of "keep it simple." This will help API providers remember that they actually want developers reading and understanding this stuff, not having it buried in the legalese that nobody will give a sh*t about.

The Federal Reserve is all talk and no action in regards to higher interest rates, and the 10-year Treasury note continues to yield around a paltry 1.8%. And while the S&P 500 SPX, -0.01%   is still in the green year-to-date, for all the ups and downs, it is basically flat with where it was back in February 2015. One safe haven amid all this mess has been the reliable growth and durability of the tech sector. But lately, even some of the big names in technology have seen trouble — including a few rather shaky earnings reports in the past week or two. So are once-mighty tech names about to roll over and disappoint like the rest of the market? Or should investors see the comparatively modest pullback in these picks as a buying opportunity? As with so many things in this market, the answer isn’t black or white. The truth is that while there are a lot of opportunities in tech, investors need to be discerning and take a more tactical approach to the sector right now than simply buying every megacap corporation with a Silicon Valley footprint. Will machines take over package deliveries?(2:09) Technology has already automated much of the sorting of packages, but delivery is still done by humans. Could machines take over the deliveries industry? Here’s a look at five of the biggest names in tech, ranked from worst to best: In last place: Amazon Look, the “worst” tech stock is still pretty good — and honestly, I expect big things from Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, -2.70%   long term. But it’s undeniable that this stock got a bit ahead of itself this year during the frenzy over Amazon Web Services’ performance, and now it may underperform for some time. At the end of October, Amazon missed profit expectations by a big margin — a huge letdown after reports in March and June showed a glimmer of what a consistently profitable Amazon could look like. I don’t knock Jeff Bezos & Co. for keeping an eye on the long term instead of managing quarter to quarter, but tactical investors should take notice of this, particularly after shares raced up from a low of under $300 in 2015 to a recent high of over $850 about a month ago. This is a company with high hopes that is priced for perfection. And while AWS continues to grow impressively on the top line, it’s undeniable that Wall Street is looking for a higher level of profitability after Amazon showed the promise of this cloud arm. It’s always hard to make the valuation argument against Amazon. However, I think the script has been changed thanks to AWS, and profitability will remain a focus of investors — but not necessarily Jeff Bezos. That may create a lot of volatility and headwinds as we enter 2017. The also-ran: Alphabet Google parent Alphabet Inc. GOOG, -2.38% GOOGL, -2.40%   may not be in danger of a decline the same way Amazon is, but it’s hard to argue that this one-time king of the internet holds as much promise as it did in years past. It has been stuck in a rut since the end of 2015, and will likely stay there for some time. Sure, Alphabet earnings for the third quarter were actually pretty darn good. Earnings hit $9.06 a share and adjusted revenue was $18.27 billion, both topping expectations. But investors weren’t thrilled with the results, and shares have steadily declined since briefly touching a 52-week high just before the report dropped. What can artificial intelligence do for retail?(2:34) Customers return about 23% of their purchases both in-store and online, costing retailers $643 billion per year. Can artificial intelligence eliminate returns through virtual 3D try-on? That’s because internet advertising stinks, quite frankly. And while the tech giant did manage to report higher revenue and narrower losses in its “other bets” segment, the Google segment continues to drive the train, with $22.25 billion of the $22.45 billion in total revenue reported. The Google segment is hardly dead, with 20% revenue growth year-over-year and 17% operating income growth. However, what’s discouraging to investors is the fact that related costs of revenue are rising, too. Like Amazon, big things surely will come from Alphabet long term. But in the here and now, there simply isn’t a lot of growth — and as we’ve seen in prior years, that could mean underperformance from this tech giant as it struggles to change a lackluster narrative in the short term. Winner of the participation prize: Apple Apple Inc. AAPL, -2.51%   has been mighty choppy in 2016, as have many tech names, and there’s reason to expect that to continue. However, on balance, I think Apple should pretty much follow the market in the next several months, making it a ho-hum pick. In some ways, this is because Apple very much is the market given its $590 billion or so in market value, it’s the largest pick on this list and thus an outsize share of cap-weighted indexes like the S&P 500 SPY, +0.08%    and Nasdaq-100 NDX, -1.05%  . But it’s also because the company is hard to pin down. Some bullish investors focus on Apple’s dividend that yields better than T-notes, its bargain forward price-to-earnings ratio of 11 or so and a massive war chest of around $240 billion in cash and investments. Some bearish investors focus on an overreliance on the iPhone as a share of revenue, and the fact that growth in this segment is seriously challenged both now and in the future. Is Apple supposed to be a growth stock or a value stock? Is it a tech disrupter of more of a 21st-century consumer staples company? Is that $240 billion ever going to be repatriated or put to real use? There are so many competing arguments with Apple that it’s impossible to know where it’s headed. That makes me think it’s doomed to middle along with the rest of the market in 2017 until the narrative changes in some substantive way. The runner-up: Netflix If it wasn’t for the nosebleed forward P/E ratio of over 100, Netflix Inc. NFLX, -1.22%   would be my top pick in tech. But after squeezing out the shorts in a big way after its third-quarter numbers, investors can still have confidence that this streaming-video giant will move higher in the months ahead. Keep in mind, for starters, that the surge in Netflix stock lately has brought it back in line with previous highs touched in both mid-2015 and late 2015. And since then, the company has been adding subscribers and programming like mad. In the most recent quarter, Netflix added 370,000 subscribers in the U.S., topping estimates despite increasing its subscription price for longtime customers from $7.99 to $9.99 earlier this year. That stickiness in the face of higher prices is a great sign. Furthermore, the growth story here continues to be overseas growth as 40% of streaming revenue now comes from international customers. Can robo advisers manage your money and emotions?(2:41) In investing, giving in to your emotions can cut your return by about 1.56 percentage points a year. Should you leave the job to an emotionless robo adviser instead? Netflix continues to prove the naysayers wrong with loyal users, award-winning programming and an aggressive growth plan that continues to grow its share even in the face of significant competition. The bears got a wake-up call after earnings, and I think the shift in sentiment will continue as Wall Street once again falls in love with the company’s growth story in the coming months. Best in Show: Facebook Facebook Inc. FB, -3.31%  was dinged after its third-quarter earnings report just a few days ago. But investors should see this dip as a rare opportunity to buy in, because longer-term, FB stock seems to do nothing but go up. Remember, even accounting for the modest recent decline, the stock is up over 230% since its 2012 initial public offering — almost four times the return of the S&P 500 in the same period. And in the past 12 months, Facebook has climbed 25% while the S&P has pretty much gone nowhere. Many investors think the stock is too pricey or too hyped, but that’s how momentum stocks work — particularly in tech, and particularly when you’re a company like Facebook that is wildly profitable and full of future potential. But the forward P/E of the market in general is about 18 right now for the S&P 500 as a group and the forward P/E of Facebook is now just 23. That hardly seems outrageous considering the scale and consistent growth of this tech giant compared with your average consumer staples stock or retailer! Besides, that growth premium is called for. In its third-quarter report, Facebook earned $1.09 per share on revenues of $7.01 billion, up 56% year-over-year. Both figures topped Street consensus views for 97 cents per share and revenues of $6.92 billion. The company beat its monthly average user forecasts to boot, boasting an amazing 1.79 million monthly users. Sure, the outlook could have been better. But no stock goes up in a straight line forever, even Facebook, and this brief pullback should be seen as a buying opportunity before the rally resumes in earnest.

Google has announced that starting today (8 November), it will display the 2016 presidential election results directly on Google Search.

Unlike their regular Nexus phones, these were two phones made completely by Google – the Pixel and Pixel XL. While HTC is the OEM for the Pixel devices, the hardware and software control lies with the Mountain View company. Pixel signifies a new chapter in Google’s phone history. So far, Google had the Nexus line which was made in collaboration with partners such as HTC, LG, Motorola, Samsung, Huawei. Google had limited or no control over the hardware and had to optimise its Android OS to suit the hardware in order to provide the best stock Android experience. But something always seemed amiss. Pixel’s birth also meant the end of the road for the Nexus line. Also with Pixel, Google has departed from the mid-range segment and entered the premium segment. A rarefied atmosphere where the likes of Apple iPhones and Samsung Galaxies rule. Or do they? Let us find out with the Pixel XL. Build and Design: 7.5 / 10 First things first. Yes, the Pixel XL does resemble an iPhone on first glance. This was reiterated by every other person who first set eyes on the sleeping Pixel XL. But considering it is made by HTC, some resemblance with the HTC 10, when you see the edges, is also noticeable. It comes in three colour colour variants which have interesting names: Quite Black, Very Silver and Really Blue. I am testing the Very Silver variant. iPhone resemblance aside, it doesn’t take away from the fact that Pixel XL is a good looking phone which feels sturdy. The phone’s metal frame is flat, but the corners have a rounded edge. The ribbed power standby button and the plain volume rocker buttons are on the right and the nano SIM card tray is on the left. There isn’t any sort of sharp edge on the phone as such, apart from the very minor drop off from where the display meets the frame. Google has gone with a glass and metal design on the rear side, instead of having a unibody design, as is the norm in the premium segment. The only reason I can think of is that the glass top gives a better grip than the slippery metal back. Online forums speculate that it is meant for better signal reception and also assist with NFC. Visually, I don’t find it that appealing. Your opinion may differ. The pearly white glass section on the rear side is slightly raised from the plane of the metal. It ensures that there is no camera bump, as the 12MP camera on the top left hand corner is flush with the surface. There is a circular finger print scanner in the lower half of the glass area. The antenna line is visible on the lower metallic half as well as three in the top half. From the front, there is nothing extraordinary about the design. The rear does make the Pixel XL recognisable. Maybe that was Google’s idea. The design is functional. It measures around 7.3mm thick around the base and 8.6mm at the top and weighs around 168 gm, making it lighter than the iPhone 7 Plus. It is IP53 certified. That means there is dust protection but it’s not waterproof. Features: 8 / 10 Google has kept the internals of both the Pixel and Pixel XL intact. The phones run on Qualcomm’s flagship Snapdragon 821 chipset – which is also the chipset required to ensure the phone is Daydream VR ready. The Snapdragon 821 chipset houses a quad-core processor with two custom Kryo cores clocked at 2.15GHz and two Kryo cores clocked at 1.6GHz. These are paired with Adreno 530 graphics solution. There is 4GB of fast LPDDR4 RAM onboard. In terms of storage you get two variants – 32GB and 128GB. We got the 32GB variant for testing out of which the available storage space was 29.7GB. It runs stock Android 7.1 Nougat OS which we will discuss in detail in the software section. There is a 5.5-inch display with QuadHD resolution which gives a respectable pixel density on the phone. In terms of connectivity, you get a single nano SIM card tray. There is support for 4G VoLTE, Wi-fi 802.11ac, Bluetooth 4.2, GPS with A-GPS and GLONASS, NFC. It lacks FM Radio. As for sensors, you have the proximity sensor which is conspicuous by its presence under the earpiece speaker on the Very Silver’s white front portion.

This year the companies have two phones that are competing in the market for dominance. The Google has the Pixel (and Pixel XL) while Apple has the iPhone 7 (and the iPhone 7 Plus). The iPhone 7 was launched before the Pixel, and it is an evolution of Apple's iPhone 6S. It is also the stepping stone to Apple's iPhone 8, which is expected to be "revolutionary" and not evolutionary. The Pixel, meanwhile, is Google's "first" phone and one of the biggest aims that Google has with it is to beat the iPhone. Well, Google almost succeeds. The Google Pixel is a good phone. Nay, it's a great phone and in many core areas is better than the iPhone 7. And yet there are three reasons that hold it back from beating the mighty iPhone. Maybe next year the Pixel will raise the bar and get its act together to beat the iPhone. But then the iPhone 8 too will be in a different league. But this year in 2017, it falls somewhat short, all because of three reasons. Also read: iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus review: The best iPhones Apple has made No waterproof body: This is kind of a big deal in a premium phone nowadays. And although people may think that a waterproof body is not something of a must have feature, take a look at it this way: It's like seatbelts in the cars. You don't know you need them until one day they save your life. The same is true for a waterproof phone. You don't realise you need it until one day accidentally you drop your phone in a bucket full of water. Also, a waterproof phone provides such incredible peace of mind. You can use it with wet hands and be a little careless about it in ways that truly make using the phone relaxing. No stereo speakers: This again is a big missing feature in Google Pixel. In fact, its speakers aren't all that good for a premium phone. The iPhone 7 on the other hand has fairly sweet sounding (for a phone) stereo speakers. Even otherwise the audio performance on the iPhone 7 is better, even if you are using an earphone or headphone. And this is despite the hassle that the iPhone 7 poses because of its lack of the 3.5mm jack. Exemplary Apple support: This is the biggest reason nowadays to buy an iPhone. If you are getting the latest iPhone, in this case that is the iPhone 7 Plus, you end up with a phone that you can, if you are little careful in the way you use the phone, end up using for 3 to 4 years despite any hassles. The phone won't slow down. You will continue getting the latest iOS updates. And if something goes wrong with your phone, you will most probably get an aftersales service that is better than the rest. We have seen it again and again that Apple supports an iPhone for 4 years. The Pixel, meanwhile, will be supported for 2 years and while Google is promising top aftersales support for the Pixel phones, we will need to see the company walk the talk on this aspect before we can see whether it matches the Apple support or not. Now, this is not to say that the Pixel is a phone that you should not buy. Far from it. In fact, we have argued that for a lot of consumers the Pixel and the Pixel XL are the best phones in the market. These two phones have the best camera every seen in a phone  and in many core areas, including the software, they edge out the iPhone 7 Plus and the iPhone 7. But like everything else out there, these two phones are also not perfect.  Also read: Pixel XL and iPhone 7 Plus vs DSLR cam: You can't tell the difference For more news from India Today, follow us on Twitter @IndiaTodayTech and on Facebook at facebook.com/indiatodaytech For news and videos in Hindi, go to AajTak.in.ताज़ातरीन ख़बरों और वीडियो के लिए आजतक.इन पर आएं.   Most Read Slow Jio 4G speed: Here's a method to increase Jio speed but why bother WhatsApp now rolls out video calling feature, for now in beta Jio 4G may remain free until March 2017: Report 32 lakh ATM cards hacked: Is your debit card safe and should you change PIN?

Most Popular Samsung plans to equip its next Galaxy S smartphones with a Siri-like digital assistant, seeking to make a comeback after the global debacle that precipitated the death of its flawed Note 7 lineup. Samsung, which last month acquired U.S.-based artificial-intelligence software company Viv Labs Inc., said the Galaxy S8 slated for next year will come with AI-enabled features "significantly differentiated" from those in the market, such as Apple's Siri or Google. Those services now offer up potentially useful information from the weather to flight times based on user activity. The flagship Galaxy S line will prove crucial to salvaging Samsung's reputation in the wake of the fiasco surrounding a Note 7 device prone to bursting into flame. The recall and eventual cessation of the line is estimated to cost upwards of $6 billion and pushed profits at its mobile division to a record low in the September quarter. The company is now investigating the root cause behind the fires, but wouldn't comment on progress so far.

Siri vs. Alexa vs. Cortana vs. Google Assistant: It's Battle of the AI Systems Google Hits a Samsung Roadblock With New AI Assistant Samsung Forecasts $5.3 Billion Profit Hit From Note 7 Crisis "It will be significantly differentiated from the current services we see in the market now," executive vice president Rhee In-jong said of the S8's features. He said last month the company plans to embed Viv's technology in other electronics and home appliances beyond phones. Global technology players are vying to build devices attuned to users' lifestyles and daily behavior. Amazon is trying to sign up more developers for its Alexa voice technology, while Apple has recently touted more Siri capabilities and opened the technology to other developers. Google, considered the leader in artificial intelligence, is making its own push. Samsung is now getting into the game. It releases new versions of its top-tier Galaxy S series sometime in the first quarter of every year, typically during the Mobile World Congress in Spain. With the Note 7 line now defunct, the S8 will become its de facto showcase smartphone. The company is keen to put the Note 7 behind it and resuscitate its business. Samsung reported a sharp decline in profit as the Note 7 recall took its toll. Net income fell 17% to 4.41 trillion won ($3.9 billion) in the third quarter, bringing its mobile profit to a historic low of 100 billion won. Samsung suffered a separate setback with a different product last week. The company is recalling about 2.8 million washing machines in the U.S. amid reports that the top of the machine can become detached during use. Samsung said in a Nov. 4 statement that it will offer consumers a free in-home repair of the machine, or a rebate that can be used when consumers buy a new machine. For more recent purchases, consumers can get a full refund. -- Bloomberg News In this article: CMO Strategy Consumer Electronics Digital Mobile Technology Telecommunications Become a Member Register Now Renew Membership Benefits Datacenter Advertising Age     Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Instagram YouTube Tumblr Copyright © 1994-2016 Crain Communications Privacy Statement Terms of Use About Us Advertise Reprints Contact Us AD AGE Creativity LookBook Datacenter Resources Events Jobs On Campus Site by AREA 17 x Scroll to Continue

Photo: Google Tweet Facebook of ╳ exit Anyone who has used the Gmail app on both Android and iPhone has noticed that one version is far inferior to the other. While Google has tended to make sure its offerings across all platforms are of a high quality, Gmail on iPhone has — for whatever reason — remained a weird, squashed and semi-broken version of its mobile website since 2012. That's all changing from today, as Google has pushed out a new update that applies the last four years' worth of features Android users have been enjoying to the version found on Apple devices. The first thing you'll notice is that the whole thing now looks like a modern app, with big images of your contacts' profile pictures beside each message and nicely animated sidebars and menus that make getting around a lot quicker. It's all done in Google's "material design", which is to say it looks identical to the Android Gmail app but leaps and bounds ahead of what the iOS Gmail used to look like. The more important improvement is to the overall speed of the app. It no longer feels like you're navigating an old website, waiting for emails in your folders to populate or hitting the search button and hoping something will eventually happen. Search will now autocomplete your queries and make suggestions as you type like most Google products do, and instead of opening and dealing with your emails one at a time you can swipe them away to archive or delete depending on your preferences. Another important upgrade is the introduction (finally) of Undo Send, which adds a delay to sent messages and allows you to save yourself the embarrassment of sending out a missive early or to the entirely wrong people. Of course iPhone users have had access to many features like these for some time via Google's own Inbox app, which may be one of the reasons the company has allowed the official Gmail app to languish for so long. But while Inbox is great for sorting out chaff emails, snoozing messages to deal with them later and interacting with emails that include rich information, there's something to be said for an app that just lets you keep up with the messages arriving in your various accounts and lets you fire off a quick reply. Now, that app is available to everyone regardless of their phone. The story Gmail app for iOS finally updated, now much faster and includes Undo Send first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.

Posted: Monday, November 07, 2016 Central Montcalm student hosting coat drive for area By Lori Hansen • Last Updated 1:15 pm on Monday, November 07, 2016 Tweet STANTON — Although mid-Michigan has been given a lingering autumn, Erin Fuerstnau knows what season comes next. After seeing children arriving at school last winter without coats and complaining they were cold, Fuerstnau, 17, of Stanton, decided to do something about it through a Central Montcalm Public School class project. “Around the beginning of September, my teacher, Mrs. (Nancy) Jerry, told our Computer Applications class about the Google 20% Project and how she wanted us to start our own projects,” said Fuerstnau, the daughter of Wendi Palmer and Rich Fuerstnau. “I began looking up ideas about what to do for my project. I found a list with ideas, I saw a coat drive was on the list and it just stuck out to me. After I saw that, I began researching how to start a coat drive. I found a website that sent me a package of everything I needed to start.” The company was One Warm Coat, a national organization started in 1992. Its mission is to provide anyone — men, women and children — in need with a warm coat. Following the “Let’s Have a Drive” link, Fuerstnau found how to conduct a drive with six easy steps. According to One Warm Coat’s website, health experts report even a 2-degree drop in body temperature results in reduced heart rate, loss of coordination and confusion. Adults cannot work effectively and children find it difficult to learn. For most, a warm coat solves that problem. But, for the nearly 15 percent of Americans living in poverty, a warm winter coat is a budget “extra.” “I’m hoping to receive all kind of sizes of coats, so, not only kids will be warm, but their families can be warm also,” Fuerstnau said. “The coats should be clean and in new or good condition.” According to Nancy Jerry, the Google 20% Project (also known as Genius Hour) was a concept Google borrowed from 3M where they encouraged their employees to use 20 percent of their time to be creative and innovative. The concepts of Gmail and Google News came from employees. “So I challenged my students to develop a skill or create something that would better themselves and/or their community and infuse their project with technology,” Jerry said. “Erin chose to do a coat drive. She researched organizations, reached out to district building principals, and created a Facebook event.” Starting Nov. 14, drop boxes will be located at Central Montcalm High School, Middle School, lower elementary, and possibly the upper elementary for coat donations. Donations will be accepted until Nov. 19. Taking on a project of this enormity is a bit daunting, but Fuerstnau is willing to tackle it. “This is my first time doing something with this large of an impact on the community,” said Fuerstnau, who for many years has donated gifts to the school’s Mitten Tree and to the Community Angel Tree. “In all, my overall project has to be done by the end of the school semester,” she added. “I’m trying to find a location that will make sure the coats are donated to people who are really in need of a coat; free of charge. I’m hoping to find a place to donate the coats before December so people can have coats for the winter.” Correspondent Lori Hansen is a Greenville-area resident.

This means that you no longer have to have a car with a compatible infotainment system – or shell out for a head unit upgrade – to use it. As with Android Auto in the car, the phone version provides a simplified interface with bigger fonts and larger buttons, better suited for use on the road. This affords drivers easier access to Google Maps and music streaming services like Spotify, as well as make calls or send messages, all using Google’s voice activation. Android Auto also cuts down on notifications, minimising distraction while driving. The update also enables the app to start up automatically when the phone is paired via Bluetooth, while a feature enabling users to access voice activation by simply saying “Ok Google” – negating the need to press the dedicated voice control button – will also be introduced in the coming weeks. Unfortunately, Waze support (also announced at the Google I/O conference in May) is still not included as yet. Of course, Android Auto is still not officially available in Malaysia – for now, those wanting to use the app will need to side-load it via an external source (i.e. not from the Google Play Store).

According to Google, they`ve seen a more than 230 percent increase for the search phrase "how to vote" compared to the 2012 election. Now the tech giant is planning to take their involvement in the vote a step further. On Monday Google announced that it will display election results directly in search as soon as the polls close. The search will expand past the presidential election as it`ll include senatorial, congressional and state-level ballot propositions as well. The results will be automatically updated every 30 seconds and will be available in more than 30 languages. To access this feature all you`ll need to type in the search bar is "election results." Doing so will display a list of detailed info about corresponding races. So if you can`t be in front of a TV for election night, don`t worry, like pretty much everything else nowadays, the info you`ll need is only a Google search away. 37.386052 -122.083851 Related stories How Likely is an Election Day Hack?

Event:US Elections:ALLGovernment and Politics:World Politics:ALLInformation and Communication:ALL:ALLUnited States:ALL:ALLus election, donald trump, hillary clinton, australian, questions, google dataABC US election: Your Google questions on Trump and Clinton answeredAustralians want to know whether Donald Trump is a Republican and what would happen if Hillary Clinton had to quit the game, according to Google search data. In addition to the mother of all US election questions — who will actually win this thing? — Australians are also asking whether Donald Trump is a Republican and what would happen if Hillary Clinton had to quit the game. Google search data from last week reveals what Australians want to know about the presidential race, with 57 per cent of questions about Mr Trump, and 43 per cent relating to Mrs Clinton. Here are the top questions Australians have been typing into Google — and their answers. Trump trending questions 1. Who will win, Clinton or Trump? Without a crystal ball we can only rely on polls, which show Mrs Clinton still holds a small lead over Mr Trump, according to the widely respected polling website Real Clear Politics. Mrs Clinton currently leads Mr Trump by three points. In mid-October she led in the same poll by 6 points, suggesting Republicans who were previously hesitant to support Mr Trump are finally embracing their candidate. Victory will turn on the outcomes in a handful of swing states being heavily courted by the candidates in these final days. Fivethirtyeight is today saying Mrs Clinton has a 69.4 per cent chance of winning the presidency. 2. What happens if Trump wins? Photo: Mr Trump is a Republican, but has changed his political party affiliations at least five times since the '80s. (Reuters: Aaron P. Bernstein) Many economists have warned of a sharp reaction on the financial market if Mr Trump wins. A paper published this week by Justin Wolfers and Eric Zitzewitz (of the University of Michigan and Dartmouth College, respectively) suggests that the US, UK and Asian share markets could fall by 10-15 per cent, and that Mexico's peso would fall by 25 per cent, in the event of a Trump victory. The Republican candidate's attitude to longstanding US strategic alliances — with NATO partners in Europe as well as Japan and South Korea — also threatens to create much greater political uncertainty around the world. Mr Trump's policies would also significantly increase the US budget deficit by $US5.3 trillion over the next decade, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. Closer to home, one of Australia's top economists, Saul Eslake, has predicted Australia will wear the collateral damage from a Trump-induced trade war between the US and China. Mr Eslake said if the US were to increase import tariffs for China, and the Chinese economy retaliated, there would be weaker demand for agricultural, mining and food products Australia sells to China. Last month, the Reserve Bank of Australia governor Philip Lowe noted, "the possible election of President Trump wouldn't be as benign an event", as Brexit turned out to be. 3. What nationality is Donald Trump's wife? Photo: Donald and Melania Trump married in 2005. (Reuters: Mark Kauzlarich) Donald Trump's third wife, Melania (Knauss) Trump, was born in Slovenia (then part of Yugoslavia). She became a permanent resident of the US in 2001 and a citizen in 2006. The former model met Mr Trump at a 1998 Fashion Week party in New York. They married in 2005 and have a 10-year-old son, Barron William Trump. 4. Is Trump winning? Currently, Mr Trump is not 'winning' because the latest poll has Mrs Clinton ahead by three points. Whether the polls will get it right is yet to be seen. 5. Is Donald Trump Republican? Indeed Mr Trump is a member of the GOP, however according to reports, he has changed his political party affiliations at least five times since the 80s. He registered as a Republican in 1987 but in 1999 he switched to the Reform Party with the hope of standing as the party's presidential nominee. On failing that, he left the Reform Party in 2001, and for the next seven years was a Democrat. But in 2008 he endorsed Republican presidential candidate John McCain and changed his party registration back to Republican in 2009. In 2011, Mr Trump became an independent for five months before returning to the Republican Party. Clinton trending questions 1. How could Hillary lose to Trump? The "damn emails" have taken their toll on Mrs Clinton's trust factor which will one of the biggest reasons voters turn away from her. Voters take issue with her actions as US secretary of state. Her tumultuous time as America's top diplomat saw her hauled before Congress following fatal attacks on two US facilities in Benghazi. Mrs Clinton's handling of the situation was criticised in a report on the deadly 2012 assault, which accused her of underestimating and then misrepresenting the extremist threat in Libya. 2. What are the Clinton emails? Photo: FBI investigations into the email scandal found Mrs Clinton not guilty. (Reuters: Kevin Lamarque) Mrs Clinton's email use has been one of the biggest vulnerabilities in her campaign for the White House. During her time as US secretary of state between 2009 and 2013, Mrs Clinton used an unauthorised private email server for her work. The FBI spent around a year investigating this after it emerged there were classified government secrets in some of her emails. They said although Mrs Clinton was "extremely careless" in her handling of sensitive information, charges against her were not appropriate. This week the FBI announced the results of a second review it conducted after new emails were discovered, and stood by its initial conclusion that no charges are warranted. 3. What happens if Hillary drops out of race? If Mrs Clinton were to throw the towel the US would be in unchartered territory — and with less than a day to go, it's not going to happen. The decision would have to be made by Mrs Clinton, and then the Democratic National Convention would have to elect a new candidate by a majority vote. 4. What is Clinton's email problem? See question 2. 5. What has Hillary Clinton done wrong? This answer is entirely up to you. international Topics: United States US Elections World Politics Share this story Do you need to give feedback or ask a question about this story?

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Google testing new Play Store UI after Pixel video “leak” By Ida Torres - November 7, 2016 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter We’re not really sure if it was just careless filmmaking or it’s actually intentional, but a recently released video showing off the Google Pixel actually also “leaked” what the Google Play Store will look like once an update has been rolled out. And since Google has been known to experiment and test out things before they officially roll out, several users have now been seeing the new UI and interface, and it looks like the update will be much better than the current one. Those with eagle-eyes noted that in the Google video, the UI of the Google Play Store was something they haven’t seen before. And now, some users have reported that their accounts are reflecting this new Play Store vibe and from the initial reactions, it seems like people like it. The most obvious is that it has a new color scheme, which is basically a darker shade of green than what we’re used to in GPS. We don’t know if it’s in preparation for Christmas season or something. Some of the other obvious changes includes a bigger Install button, which apparently now takes the whole width of the screen, instead of just a small bar on the right side. The ratings of the app as well as the number of times the app has been downloaded is also now much easier to understand, while the category of the app has also been moved, and it’s now centered and a little bit lower. It is much better to see what kind of app it is that you’re looking at. We have no idea yet as to when theses changes would take into effect, or if they even will see the light of day. But we hope it will since based on the screenshots, it does look pretty good. Let’s wait and see for a Google Play Store update and if these screenshots are accurate.

Andrés Cardenal (TMFacardenal) Nov 7, 2016 at 7:00PM Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) operating profit margin has been moving in the wrong direction over the past several years, a potential cause for concern among investors in the company. Make no mistake, though: Google is as profitable as ever, and the overall profitability picture for Alphabet still looks pretty good.  On Alphabet's profit margins The company formerly known as Google changed its name and corporate structure last year. Alphabet is a combination of two main segments: Google and "other bets." Google doesn't need much introduction, as the online advertising juggernaut features tremendously popular services and applications such as Google Search, Android, and YouTube, among many others. The other-bets division is more obscure, including a collection of projects and businesses in highly innovative areas such as self-driving cars, Nest, Fiber, Calico, and Verily. When looking at Alphabet as a whole, profitability levels remain high, but they're under pressure. The following chart illustrates the decline in the company's operating margin over the past five years, and the trend doesn't look particularly encouraging. GOOG Operating Margin (TTM) data by YCharts It's interesting to note that GAAP and non-GAAP operating margin, which excludes stock-based compensation expenses, are notoriously different for Alphabet. During the the third quarter of 2016, the company produced a GAAP operating margin around 26% of revenue, while non-GAAP operating margin was a much higher 34%. Stock-based compensation is a crucial metric that needs to be included in profitability analysis. On the other hand, it's a non-cash expense item, and it fluctuates considerably from quarter to quarter. Stock-based compensation amounted to $1.9 billion last quarter, up 30% year over year and increasing by 24% versus the second quarter of 2016. Even if stock-based compensation can't be ignored, investors may want to keep in mind how this remarkably singular item can distort operating profitability figures in a particular period. Looking under the surface Even more important, profitability levels for Google and other bets are completely dissimilar, and the difference can have a remarkably significant impact. The other-bets division produced $197 million in revenue last quarter and generated an operating loss of $865 million, so the division is considerably dragging on overall company-level profitability. Management believes that investors should analyze the other-bets segment from a long-term perspective, as opposed to focusing too much on quarterly figures. Other bets are mostly early-stage projects, and they also represent an aggregation of businesses operating in different industries. In addition, performance in a particular quarter can be materially affected by one-time items, such as new partnership deals. Still, the point remains that the segment is taking a big toll on the company's margins. Image source: Alphabet. As for Google in isolation, the business produced $22.25 billion in revenue and $6.78 billion in operating income last quarter. GAAP operating margin was thus 30% of revenue during the period. Stock-based compensation amounted to $1.6 billion, so operating margin excluding stock-based compensation was an impressive 38%. Even when considering that companies in the industry tend to offer above-average profitability, Google's profit margins are substantially above those of the competition. As reference, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) reported an operating profit margin of 25% during the quarter ended in September, while Chinese search engine Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) produced an operating margin around 16% of sales in the third quarter of 2016.  What this means for investors Alphabet is a combination of two segments with remarkably different characteristics. Google is an undisputed leader in online advertising generating tremendous profitability, while other bets is a portfolio of projects with intriguing long-term potential that produce considerable operating losses. Image source: Alphabet. Only time will tell what kind of profitability Alphabet can generate from other bets over the coming years. However, if management decides that those investments no longer make sense, it can easily cut back on other-bets spending without hurting Google at all. Doing so would allow Alphabet to increase overall margins to levels more in line with those of Google, generating a big boost to profitability. The only reason Alphabet's operating margins are declining is that the company is investing lots of money in other bets. Google is still a moneymaking machine, so investors in the company don't need to worry much about profitability.   Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

After some had heard that Google wasn’t planning to restock the Really Blue color, Android Police reached out to Google to confirm the validity of those rumors… According to a Google spokesperson speaking to the news site, the company plans to restock the Really Blue color of the phone. Google also urged interested buyers to use the Play Store’s waitlist functionality to be notified when more stock of the color becomes available. While this isn’t necessarily a surefire way to guarantee yourself a Really Blue Pixel, it will certainly help your case. While the Really Blue Google Pixel is technically a “limited edition” model, this news means that the phone is here to stay for at least a little while longer, but it’s still unclear as to when the phone will sellout for good. The Really Blue color is also exclusive to the United States for now, but that is likely to change as time progresses. Were you able to get your order in for a Really Blue Google Pixel? Let us know in the comments. Also let us know if you’re able to secure one at some point down the line using the wait list functionality on the Play Store.

After shipping Google Home units to buyers and showing up in retail stores last week, Google has just made bases for Google Home available through the Google Store which allow just a bit more customization to the product… These bases are purely made for cosmetics and are made from either fabric or metal.

Andrés Cardenal (TMFacardenal) Nov 7, 2016 at 7:00PM Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) operating profit margin has been moving in the wrong direction over the past several years, a potential cause for concern among investors in the company. Make no mistake, though: Google is as profitable as ever, and the overall profitability picture for Alphabet still looks pretty good.  On Alphabet's profit margins The company formerly known as Google changed its name and corporate structure last year. Alphabet is a combination of two main segments: Google and "other bets." Google doesn't need much introduction, as the online advertising juggernaut features tremendously popular services and applications such as Google Search, Android, and YouTube, among many others. The other-bets division is more obscure, including a collection of projects and businesses in highly innovative areas such as self-driving cars, Nest, Fiber, Calico, and Verily. When looking at Alphabet as a whole, profitability levels remain high, but they're under pressure. The following chart illustrates the decline in the company's operating margin over the past five years, and the trend doesn't look particularly encouraging. GOOG Operating Margin (TTM) data by YCharts It's interesting to note that GAAP and non-GAAP operating margin, which excludes stock-based compensation expenses, are notoriously different for Alphabet. During the the third quarter of 2016, the company produced a GAAP operating margin around 26% of revenue, while non-GAAP operating margin was a much higher 34%. Stock-based compensation is a crucial metric that needs to be included in profitability analysis. On the other hand, it's a non-cash expense item, and it fluctuates considerably from quarter to quarter. Stock-based compensation amounted to $1.9 billion last quarter, up 30% year over year and increasing by 24% versus the second quarter of 2016. Even if stock-based compensation can't be ignored, investors may want to keep in mind how this remarkably singular item can distort operating profitability figures in a particular period. Looking under the surface Even more important, profitability levels for Google and other bets are completely dissimilar, and the difference can have a remarkably significant impact. The other-bets division produced $197 million in revenue last quarter and generated an operating loss of $865 million, so the division is considerably dragging on overall company-level profitability. Management believes that investors should analyze the other-bets segment from a long-term perspective, as opposed to focusing too much on quarterly figures. Other bets are mostly early-stage projects, and they also represent an aggregation of businesses operating in different industries. In addition, performance in a particular quarter can be materially affected by one-time items, such as new partnership deals. Still, the point remains that the segment is taking a big toll on the company's margins. Image source: Alphabet. As for Google in isolation, the business produced $22.25 billion in revenue and $6.78 billion in operating income last quarter. GAAP operating margin was thus 30% of revenue during the period. Stock-based compensation amounted to $1.6 billion, so operating margin excluding stock-based compensation was an impressive 38%. Even when considering that companies in the industry tend to offer above-average profitability, Google's profit margins are substantially above those of the competition. As reference, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) reported an operating profit margin of 25% during the quarter ended in September, while Chinese search engine Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) produced an operating margin around 16% of sales in the third quarter of 2016.  What this means for investors Alphabet is a combination of two segments with remarkably different characteristics. Google is an undisputed leader in online advertising generating tremendous profitability, while other bets is a portfolio of projects with intriguing long-term potential that produce considerable operating losses. Image source: Alphabet. Only time will tell what kind of profitability Alphabet can generate from other bets over the coming years. However, if management decides that those investments no longer make sense, it can easily cut back on other-bets spending without hurting Google at all. Doing so would allow Alphabet to increase overall margins to levels more in line with those of Google, generating a big boost to profitability. The only reason Alphabet's operating margins are declining is that the company is investing lots of money in other bets. Google is still a moneymaking machine, so investors in the company don't need to worry much about profitability.   Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

Home Industry Companies Mobile video advertising and native ads now key in marketer’s arsenal Mobile video advertising and native ads now key in marketer’s arsenal Mobile video advertising and native ads are becoming key components in a marketer’s arsenal By: Ankita Rai | Updated: November 8, 2016 7:48 AM In mobile advertising, many new ad formats around video are gaining ground with brands considering call-to-action video campaigns. (Source: Reuters) Mobile plays a pivotal role in overall marketing plans of not just new economy brands but traditional players as well, with the latter now going beyond brand awareness campaigns on digital. And rightly so. According to a Criteo survey, 36% of online traffic for major retail, e-commerce and travel companies in India, comes from mobile websites and apps generating overall sales of 32%. Online traffic from mobile apps alone comprises 11%, which gets totally converted into actual sales. No wonder mobile campaigns are increasingly becoming sophisticated with an increased focus on performance marketing. Even campaigns on social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook are linked to performance metrics. “A lot of marketers now track the number of visits that lead back to the website and time spent by the user on the site. They focus not just on app downloads but also on downstream events, such as how users engage with the app post download,” says Akshay Mathur, SVP, Komli Media. In mobile advertising, many new ad formats around video are gaining ground with brands considering call-to-action video campaigns. So far, video was only seen as an extension of TV and not directly linked to performance. “In terms of display and search, you are way more likely to survive a plane crash than you are to click through a banner ad,” muses Vijay Kunduri, commercial director, ASEAN and India, Unruly. “In the face of these declining metrics, marketers are looking at more impactful ad solutions and formats. That’s where video comes in, being the most impactful medium for storytelling.” According to a recent Nielsen Consumer Neuroscience study, video ads with above average EEG scores (emotional ads) deliver a 23% uplift in sales volume, and according to Unruly EQ data, around 70% of viewers who experience an intense emotional response to an ad are more likely to buy the product. On top of this, the emergence of OTT players implies a likely massive increase in advertisers adopting video. “We’ll also see a further rise in user-controlled outstream video formats, given that Indian consumers are the second most likely, after the UK, to want to control video ads,” Kunduri adds. So while video gains momentum on mobile, native and display ads are not far behind when it comes to non-intrusive, performance-oriented ad solutions. BrandWagon looks into how publishers and advertisers are working with new ad formats as a part of their mobile strategy. A mobile-first approach Yahoo India rolled out its mobile ad format, Tiles in September this year. Yahoo Tiles, a post tap ad format, is cross-device, lightweight, mobile optimised and non-invasive in nature. “We built this using lightweight components that allow us to efficiently design and develop ads with swipable images, videos, social feeds and 360° content based on campaign objectives,” says Roger Li, director, ad creative technology, APAC, Yahoo. As part of its mobile-first strategy, Yahoo India is working on re-imagining its global platforms (search, mail and Tumblr) and content verticals (news, sports, finance and lifestyle) to create immersive experiences and advertising opportunities that align with these new environments. “In fact, mobile is the largest contributor to MAVENS (mobile, video, native and social) adding over $1 billion, or nearly a quarter to our traffic-driven revenue,” says Gurmit Singh, VP and MD, Yahoo India. In India, two ad formats lead the way when it comes to mobile advertising: video and native. Experts say in the last six to seven months, the Indian market has opened itself to video ads in a big way. “The number of videos played on our mobile network in India grew 150% between January and June this year,” says Arun Pattabhiraman, VP and global head of marketing, InMobi. The company is bringing advanced video ad formats in India this year such as vertical video, which is a full screen, immersive, 9:16 aspect ratio video format and second, 360 degree video. It is a VR experience and enables a 360 degree view of the location where the video was shot. For Google, 55% of watch time for YouTube comes from mobile. “Most of our advertisers that prefer to go on TV are also looking to reach out to individual consumers on mobile via YouTube,” says Nitin Bawankule, industry director, e-commerce, local and media, Google India. In September, Google introduced its call-to-action TrueView ad format for YouTube. It is designed to move video beyond general branding where advertisers can display a call-to-action banner at the base of the video during and at the end of the video. According to Google, three ad formats work well in India. One, TrueView video ad, which is a win-win for both consumers and advertisers. While consumers have the option to skip the ad and save time and bandwidth, advertisers don’t have to pay unless the consumer sees the complete ad, or for at least 20 seconds. Other ad formats are YouTube bumper ads and Google shopping ads. The former are five second ads and work well in the case of product launches or if an advertiser wants to push app downloads. Even as video ads are hogging the limelight, it doesn’t mean the end of the road for search and display ads. At Google, close to 60% of search queries come from mobile. However, there is a shift towards display on mobile. “More and more people are directly searching within the app instead of searching through the toolbar. On the mobile you get a better response by going directly to say, a Swiggy or Flipkart,” says Pattabhiraman of InMobi. However, after video, the biggest growth driver is native ad format. “The advantage of native is that it lends itself to many different forms — depending on the content in which it is immersed,” says Singh of Yahoo. It could be text or video or image, ranging from in-stream advertising to in-game native formats. Studies of native campaigns on the Yahoo network show that as compared to display ads, native ads are more effective — a user is 3.6 times more likely to conduct a branded search and six times more likely to run a related search after seeing a native ad. Focus on RoI While mobile is clearly an established advertising medium for e-commerce, the story of traditional players in the FMCG, auto and insurance space is no different. Even FMCG has moved around 15 to 20% of its spends to digital. Consider this: HDFC Life gets 30% traffic monthly from mobile on its website and on an average spends 15-20% of the total media budget on digital for its campaigns. “Mobile is an inherent part of our marketing media mix constituting around 40% of the budget and it increases every year,” says Sanjay Tripathy, senior executive VP, marketing, e-commerce, analytics and digital, HDFC Life. According to HDFC Life, impact properties perform well on mobile. “The roadblock ad format on mobile gives us branding plus website visits, while standard 300×250 and native branding banners are good for regular campaigns,” Tripathy adds. “The medium also allows us to directly connect with our customers through conversations; learn from their experiences and often surprise them with a ‘money-can’t-buy’ opportunity,” says Coca-Cola India spokesperson. The largest beverage maker in the country by revenue also uses performance advertising from time to time, such as during the launch of Coke Zero in India. While newer ad formats have witnessed greater traction, it is the ‘topicality’ and ‘situational advertising’ that drives greater engagement for most traditional brands. However, the story is different for digital-born brands. For example, ShopClues decided to go digital for offer marketing this festive season unlike its peers who focussed on print and TV. “We spent about 30% of our budget during Diwali on digital, which was mostly videos,” says Nitin Agarwal, AVP, marketing, ShopClues where about 25-30% of the marketing spend is focussed on digital of which 70-75% is on mobile. Online furnishing retailer Pepperfry, on the other hand, equally distributes its marketing budgets between online and offline. Within online, 70% of the budgets are attributed towards search, which include SEO, product listing, re-marketing, SEM and others. “For us performance marketing channels such as keyword search, Facebook and PLA have worked very well,” says Kashyap Vadapalli, CMO at Pepperfry. “We spend about 20-25% on mobile,” he adds. However, any mobile strategy cannot work in a silo, given that TV is still a significant part of the ad spend. “With 230 minutes a day spent by the individual consumer, mobile has emerged as the largest device of shared consumption habit with television,” says Hitesh Chawla, co-founder and CEO, SilverPush, a digital marketing company. “In the future, we expect to see the use of mobile meshing as an effective behaviour tool to understand and optimise TV media spends in real time.” Starting from creative optimisation to what kind of TV channels and day parts benefit the marketer to see action from the consumer post the appearance of the TV ad, brands could link digital goals to measure the effectiveness of TV ad campaigns.

However, it has absolutely huge potential to finally bring VR to the masses. Welcome Home: Google's $130 smart speaker Google's smart Home speaker still has a lot of learning to do, and loses out to Amazon's Echo in some areas - but has incredible potential 'Not quite an iPhone replacement': Google's Pixel phone Google's Pixel handset is good, and boasts an amazing camera and smart assistant. It's the king of the Android handsets - but still not great. Xbox One S review: Console that will make your 4K TV shine Microsoft's Xbox One S has shrunk the giant console by 40%, and is stunningly designed console with 4K HDR capabilities - but comes with some caveats. The $1,000 wireless speaker that really IS worth the price: Naim Mu-so Qb review Naim's incredible Mu-So Qb takes you back to the good old days - where the music captivates and enthralls, rather that simply being something in the background.

The iPad grows up: Apple's iPad Pro The iPad Pro is, for many, a real laptop replacement - and a way to combine work and play in a gadget that will last all day and won't break your back to carry. 'A glimpse into the future of the living room': The new Apple TV Apple says apps are the future of TV, and while its new $149 box does have some issues, its combination of streaming services, games and other apps make it the best way to make your TV smart. The end of wonky wifi: Google's OnHub It's incredibly simple to set up, and we found it tripled the speed of our home wifi connection - but at $199 is expensive..

New Masters of the Universe Toys Announced It Turns Out Rats Are Actually Ticklish Gear Up For Final Fantasy XV With This Final Fantasy Gift Guide More Tech IFixit Teardown of Google Home Reveals Chromecast Guts and a Little House By Ryan Whitwam 11.07.2016 :: 3:00PM EST RyanWhitwam Stay on target iFixit Tears down the PlayStation 4 pro, Deems It Highly Repairable New MacBook Pro Taken Apart by iFixit The Amazon Echo seemed like a strange idea when Amazon introduced it two years ago, but the voice-activated assistant hub has proven popular with consumers. Now, Google is leveraging its more powerful voice-activated “Assistant” in a similar product called Google Home. It is iFixit’s solemn duty when new hardware comes out to tear it apart so we may see what makes it tick (or talk, in this case). What iFixit found in Google Home is rather amusing—there’s actually a little house in there. Before digging into the Google Home, iFixit took an x-ray photo of its insides. Right up at the top is a peculiar house shape. What’s that all about? You have to bust it open to find out. After removing the magnetic base cover, the main chassis can be opened with a few torx screws. There’s only one cable to worry about when taking the case apart—it runs from the motherboard up to the touch-sensitive board at the top of the device (it also houses the microphones). This board is actually glued to the top with a layer of mega-sticky adhesive. Luckily, that’s the only glue in Google Home. The motherboard shares a lot of features with the Chromecast. There’s a Marvell dual-core ARM A7 SoC, 256MB of storage, and 512MB of RAM. As for that house shape from the x-ray, that’s the PCB printing on around the Marvell wireless controller (see below). Fun. The entire bottom section of Google Home is taken up by the 2-inch speaker driver with dual passive radiators. A rubber gasket is the only thing holding it in place after the rest of the case is removed. Interestingly, the bottom of the device where the magnetic cover attachment is also has a charging cable that doesn’t connect to anything. iFixit speculates it may have originally been intended to make into Home a portable device. In all, iFixit gives Google Home a repairability score of 8 out of 10. It only loses points for the glue on the top board and a DC jack soldered to the main board. Not bad.

Skip to content Military Technologies Military Press Releases What Google can’t do: Filtered to run learning personalisation workshop at eLN Connect Press release London, UK04 Nov 2016Training Press ReleasesFiltered How does corporate L&D not only co-exist with Google, YouTube and everything else in what Elliott Masie has called the ‘learning panorama’ – but actually go one step beyond it? Facing an overwhelming amount of content and the expectation of personalization, are we doomed to imitate what we can’t beat? Toby Harris, Solution Architect at Filtered, will address these questions in a 30-minute session (Personalizing for business performance – what Google can’t do) at the eLN Connect London meeting on 10th November. This interactive workshop will evaluate when external consumer sites are useful for organisational learning – and when they aren’t. Provocatively, it proposes that we have far more power to personalize this panorama for workplace performance than we think. As an example, Toby will introduce a new learning recommendation engine: the Global Filter. This plug-and-play tool arranges and connects content to learners based on role, career aspirations and organisational priorities. More information about the Global Filter and Filtered’s unique approach to pinpointing skills gaps, minimising training time and increasing workforce productivity, will be available from the Filtered team on its stand at the eLN Connect conference or by contacting Filtered on hello@filtered.com and +44 (0)20 7729 9043.  www.filtered.com About eLearning Network  The eLearning Network (eLN) is a non-profit, Community Interest Company run by the elearning community for the elearning community. For over 25 years, the eLN has been the number one source for guidance on best practice and future trends in technology-based learning and development at work, with over 3000 members in the UK and beyond. More information on the eLN is available via: https://www.elearningnetwork.org. About Filtered Filtered is an award winning online training platform which personalizes learning material for each user. By asking users questions about their role, aspiration and proficiency, the platform’s machine learning algorithm is able to pinpoint skills gaps and filter out material that the user doesn’t need or already knows. This minimises time spent training, maximises the impact of learning and increases productivity. This approach of pinpointing skills gaps across a portfolio of core skills means that 97% of material covered in a Filtered course is relevant to the learner. Filtered’s online courses have been designed for the modern knowledge worker. Filtered offers training in essential subjects and programmes used daily by today’s workforce – from Microsoft applications to project management, business writing and business analysis. Users are professionals from all roles and sectors. Clients include Asda, EE, New Look, EY, Regus and the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW). In 2015 Filtered was an EdTech 20 finalist; hosted Personalized training: if not now, when?, a conference on learning personalization; and launched the Filtered Foundation.

Picture it in your mind — don’t overthink it. What are they wearing? What's their gender? The color of their skin? If you aren’t all that happy with what popped into your head, it’s understandable. Not to worry, this is a safe space. And you’re not alone. In 1983, David Chambers published his work on the Draw-a-Scientist Test, in which he simply asked a number of elementary school students to “draw a picture of a scientist.” Core stereotypes emerged from this test and the many similar studies that have followed throughout the years. For example, the presence of a white lab coat, facial hair, glasses, and chemistry equipment. Among these stereotypes are that a scientist is white and male. We draw what we see. Many of us are anchored in the images of the “real” and popular scientists at an early age, usually reinforced by history class. They’re the Old Boy’s Group of Discoverers: Edison, Newton, Tesla, Darwin, Einstein. These “Founding Fathers” — the ones that would be printed on Science Dollars if they existed (come to think of it, they do... they’re called grants) — command respect and adoration. They are the ones that “do” science. Go ahead, Google “famous scientists.” With whatever algorithm Google uses for the pre-selected banner, only two women make the cut for the first 30 spots, with no people of color present at all until George Washington Carver at #31. The Peanut Wizard deserves better than this. From those roots, our image of a scientist is affected by a variety of factors including our socioeconomic backgrounds, education, and personal connections. And then there’s popular culture. Growing up, we’re exposed to all varieties of media — movies, television, the Internet, books (please ignore “books” if you’re reading this 10 years into the future) — and this exposure can fundamentally shape how we perceive things. Indeed, this influence has been found to be true in relation to students’ perceptions of scientist. For example, a more recent study found that when drawing a scientist, 4th grade students that cited entertainment media as their primary source of inspiration were more likely to depict scientists unrealistically than those inspired by science communication media and school. (In this context, an unrealistic scientist mixes-potions-makes-explosions, while a realistic scientist puts asterisks above bar graphs.) However, this can go beyond just a perception. One longitudinal study exploring the effects of media on the self-esteem of black and white children discovered that television exposure “predicted a decrease in self-esteem for all children except white boys.” We call that difference in self-esteem White Male Privilege. Now, there are many factors at play here, but we can’t discount the role of representation. Importantly, even women and people of color were inclined to stereotype a typical scientist as white and male. According to a 2013 report by the U.S. Census Bureau, women, Hispanics, and African Americans are still significantly underrepresented in STEM fields compared to their representation in the overall workforce. It’s easier to imagine the stereotype when it truly mirrors the vast majority. For a more thorough academic analysis of this concept, watch Zootopia. Unsurprisingly, this also holds true in the entertainment industry. Just this year, the Comprehensive Annenburg Report on Entertainment found that across 414 film and television/streaming programs reviewed from 2014-2015, only 33.5% of females had speaking roles. Additionally, only 28.3% of non-white ethnic groups were speaking characters on these platforms, disproportional to the 37.9% of the population they make up. While the problem is clearly not endemic to just this industry, it’s easy to see how the images it presents exist for society to emulate. Underrepresentation in entertainment means underrepresentation in professions portrayed, which can then be internalized by the viewer. Nobody should think that a STEM job is “for white people” — outside of Nazi Physician. Representation alone is emphasized so much here because it appears that it will be the primary issue as we move into more progressive times. Between 1983 and 2001, negative stereotypes about scientists markedly eroded and scientists in general were depicted more positively by mass media. Other studies have found that women scientists are depicted in equivalent status to men in more recent portrayals. Essentially, the entertainment industry is making strides to portray scientists in general in a more positive light and run against gendered stereotypes. But exactly how much does it matter if the underrepresented groups have little presence? It’s encouraging that, say, a Latina scientist won’t be depicted as dependent and inferior to her male counterparts, but the main hurdle is having her show up at all. It’s a bit like pouring a bucket of sprinkles on a donut hole. You’re content that your hole is candied, but there’s a whole bakery out there that could have used those extra sprinkles. Studies suggest that portrayals of scientists in media do not buck this trend. One study that reviewed scientists in television programs viewed by middle-school children concludes, “Consistent with other studies, the typical scientist character in these programs was an unmarried Caucasian man who did not have children, held a high-status science position, and was likely to be portrayed as being intelligent.” Notably, intersectionality (the overlap of social identities) is also a rare occurrence: depictions of women scientists are overwhelmingly white. When we consider that women are underrepresented from the outset, this renders women scientists of color nearly invisible. African American men have had some better success in this regard with major roles in such films as The Invasion, The Hunger Games trilogy, Source Code, and the television series Westworld. What do all of these works have in common? Jeffrey Wright plays the African American scientist. The man just really loves playing a scientist. Or maybe studios are unwilling to seek out other employable Black actors for similar roles. The truth is somewhere in the donut. Interestingly, Asian Americans, which are actually overrepresented in STEM fields, are the least likely to show up in film/television. There are some bright spots, however, like Dr. Henry Wu from Jurassic Park/World fame, the geneticist that indirectly caused the horrific incidents of both films, and Helen Cho from Avengers: Age of Ultron, whose biggest contribution to the film occurred while under mind control. Progress! Good luck finding Hispanic scientists in U.S. television or film, unless Dora the Explorer’s School Science Fair Episode satisfies the need for you. Even if we pivot to educational materials, the story doesn’t change. A literature review of children’s trade books from 1991 to 2011 also turned up a similar result, finding that “the scientists depicted were mostly male and mostly White.” The writers of that paper put it best: “if children's trade books are truly ‘a child's first introduction to science’, then perhaps that introduction should strive to present the community of science as we would like it to be, rather than strictly how it is.” Optimism, not realism, should be at the forefront of thinking when considering the gender and/or ethnicity of a scientist in popular media. As scientists and professionals ourselves, it’s important that we foster open communication with the mass media and encourage greater representation among all groups. While this article solely covers the media component, it’s actually more important that children are exposed to scientists from all walks of life. Many of these same studies also conclude that children that have personal connections and experiences with real scientists, especially ones from diverse backgrounds, are less likely to hold unrealistic, stereotypical images of scientists. If you are from an underrepresented group, volunteer in your community and show the next generation that science is not a white man’s job. In the words of Melania Trump, they need “to know that the only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work for them.” White men have nothing to lose from these efforts, but the underrepresented have everything to gain. Whether it’s the valiant savior discovering the cure for the zombie outbreak or the background fodder of the research facility that gets eaten by zombies, it’s always important to ask the question, “Does this person have to be a white man?” Because there’s a child on the other end of the screen of that age-inappropriate program that may be thinking, “I, too, can live a successful and productive life making grand advancements in the STEM field before my brains are clawed out,” if they only saw someone like them.   Aaron Mattingly is a 4th year PhD student in the Biomedical Sciences program studying the roles of ErbB3 in organ development.

Not only are you hammered with hyperbole from all directions, with each company insisting its product is Elvis, Jesus and Chuck Norris rolled into one, but there are almost as many different software/platform combos as there are phones. Let New Atlas help, as we line up our picks for the 10 best high-end smartphones of 2016 – to compare their features, specs and harder-to-define intangibles. For this late 2016 edition of our Smartphone Comparison Guide, we're looking at 10 handsets: Google Pixel XL Google Pixel Apple iPhone 7 Plus Apple iPhone 7 LG V20 Samsung Galaxy S7 edge Samsung Galaxy S7 HTC 10 OnePlus 3 Motorola Moto Z (aka Moto Z Droid) We left out some quality mid-ranged handsets, like the iPhone SE, Moto G4 and Moto Z Play; if you're looking to save a few bucks, they're all solid options. We also skipped some major flagships like the LG G5 (its modular design fell short, and was eclipsed by its more-recent successor, the V20) and the Moto Z's sibling, the Moto Z Force (thicker, heavier and more expensive than the capable standard model). Size The LG V20 is the biggest phone in this bunch, but the iPhone 7 Plus (which has a smaller screen) isn't far behind. The iPhone 7 is smallest, but the Galaxy S7 is only a slightly bigger phone with a significantly bigger screen. At some point razor-thin phones went out of style, as phone-makers tried to find a better balance of thickness, battery life and screen resolution. The only handset in this bunch pushing that boundary is the super-svelte Moto Z, though you may prefer to use it with one of its modular add-ons, which will make it beefier. Weight The Moto Z is also ludicrously light, tipping the scales lighter than the much smaller iPhone 7. Build Aluminum makes an appearance on all 10 phones, though Samsung only uses its metal frames to bind glass fronts and backs. Colors Each phone gives you some degree of choice in colors. The asterisk next to the jet black iPhone 7 and 7 Plus? That's because Apple snuck in an upsale technique (a trick growing more common under Tim Cook's Apple), only offering that none-more-black option in the more expensive 128 GB and 256 GB models. Display size The iPhone 7 is the only handset in this bunch that drops below the 5-inch display threshold. You could say that makes it a little better for folks who don't want a huge handset, but keep in mind the Galaxy S7 gives you an 18 percent bigger screen in only a slightly bigger phone. The 5.7-inch LG V20 has the largest screen in this rogue's gallery, giving you 7 percent more area than the five 5.5-inch phones. Display resolution The iPhone 7 is also the only phone in this bunch to fall short of 400 pixels-per-inch, but Apple paid enough attention to details that won't show up on spec sheets – color range, brightness, contrast, richness – to keep its screen looking close to top-notch. Display type The AMOLED vs. IPS breakdown comes out 6-4 in favor of AMOLED. Pressure-sensitive display Apple is still the only major smartphone-maker bothering with pressure-sensitive displays, with its 3D Touch tech. It's essentially the mobile right-click, bringing up various shortcuts and previews by pressing harder on the screen. Second Screen LG is one of those delightful Android-phone-makers that's always throwing wacky new stuff against the wall. Following last year's V10, the updated V20 has a small strip of screen sitting above the main display that shows various shortcuts and alerts without trespassing on your main screen's turf. Curved display After the fiery Note 7 was recalled and discontinued, that left the Galaxy S7 edge as Samsung's only current-gen phone with a curved-edge display. It's mostly a cosmetic addition, though it can also do many of the same things as LG's Second Screen, only vertically (with the major difference that, in Samsung's case, that strip steals space from the main display). Camera megapixels Megapixel counts, once past a certain threshold (which all of these are) don't mean much. But we can say anecdotally that our tests showed the Google Pixel and Pixel XL providing the best photography of the year. The LG V20, iPhones and Galaxies all came somewhat close. Camera aperture (rear) The logic goes that wider aperture means better low-lit photography – and if you're looking only at physical sensors, then that's probably going to hold true. But Google's HDR software algorithms give the Pixel phones the best low-lit smartphone shots we've ever seen, despite having a mere ƒ/2.0 aperture. Dual-lens camera (rear) The iPhone 7 Plus and LG V20 both have dual rear cameras, but they each serve different purposes. The iPhone's second lens is a telephoto/zoom one, letting you jump between standard and 2x shots with the push of a button. The two cameras also combine to enable a new Portrait Mode that simulates (with hit-or-miss quality) the bokeh/blurred-background effect of a DSLR or mirrorless camera. LG's second sensor shoots wider landscapes instead, and lacks any kind of faux-bokeh effect. OIS The Pixel phones stand as evidence that great camera software can transcend camera spec sheets. Not only do they have the smallest apertures in this bunch, they also lack Optical Image Stabilization. Yet they have not only the best low-lit photography, but also the most stable and least-blurred shots of moving subjects that we've seen in a phone. Battery (capacity) The Galaxy S7 edge has the biggest (highest-capacity) battery in this bunch, but many other factors play into real-world battery life (keep reading). Battery benchmark (lower is better) In our own battery benchmark, where we stream video over Wi-Fi with screen brightness measured at a consistent luminance, the Samsung phones and OnePlus 3 had the best scores – dropping just 9 percent per hour. While the larger Google Pixel XL fared pretty well, the smaller Pixel lost a disappointing 14 percent per hour. Fast charging Over two years after fast-charging tech started popping up in Android flagships (and has improved incrementally since), Apple has yet to offer its own version of this handy feature. Removable battery The LG V20 harkens back to older Android flagships, with its removable battery. If you pick up a spare, you can skip the bulky battery cases or clunky portable chargers, and simply swap that out during an unusually long day. Wireless charging Only Samsung built wireless charging into its phones, but you can buy a battery mod (read on) for the Moto Z that adds the same functionality. Some models of the LG V20 can add wireless charging, if you buy a replacement backing that supports it. Processor You're getting a fast phone no matter which you pick, but in our experience, we found the iPhones and Pixels to provide the smoothest, most real-time feeling in day-to-day performance. RAM RAM isn't always a perfect predictor of real-life multitasking performance (the iPhone 7, for example, still fares very well there), but for those keeping score, the OnePlus 3 has the most. Storage For internal storage, most phones give you several different pricing tiers to choose from. LG and OnePlus are the most generous in their base tiers, with a spacious 64 GB. Expandable storage Only half the phones, though, let you expand/augment that internal storage by popping in a microSD card. These relatively cheap solutions can add up to 2 TB. The V20 has the best all-around storage setup, with 64 GB internal as standard and microSD support. Water resistance Samsung and Apple both added water resistance to their 2016 flagships, but the Galaxies have the higher rating (their IP68 means they can be immersed continuously, while the iPhones' IP67 allows for 1 m/3.3 ft of water for up to 30 minutes). The asterisked phones have some light water resistance (usually just splash protection), but not enough to warrant a full "yes." Hi-Fi audio If you're an audiophile, or at least have a high-quality pair of headphones (think more Sennheiser, Sony or Bose's latest, less Beats), then the LG V20 and HTC 10 can give you outstanding audio without needing to buy any extra DAC accessories. The V20 gets the edge here, though, with its "Quad DAC" for headphone use (the HTC 10 has a standard built-in DAC too) and AptX HD support for wireless listening (the HTC 10 supports last-gen AptX, not the newer HD variant). With Hi-Fi audio files (or Hi-Fi streaming from Tidal) and the right pair of cans, both phones will produce much better sound than anything else in this group. Apple likes to brand itself as a company that "loves music," but it's less concerned than LG or HTC with making that music sound as good as possible. Headphone jack Apple made headlines when it killed the headphone jack in the 2016 iPhones, but Lenovo beat Tim Cook and Co. to the punch by a couple of months with the Moto Z. VR For nearly two years (if you count the Innovator Edition dev kits), Samsung phones were the only place to get high-quality virtual reality on your phone. That's set to change with the coming arrival of Google Daydream, which, at launch, will only work with one headset (Daydream View) and two handsets (the Pixels). Samsung's and Oculus' Gear VR, though, still has the best selection of mobile VR content by a wide margin. Daydream's library will likely take some time to catch up. Daydream View has one potential advantage in the inclusion of a single motion controller: a far cry from motion controls on higher-end VR setups, but still something the Gear VR doesn't yet have or support. Virtual assistant The Pixel phones mark the debut of Google Assistant, a more evolved version of the old Google Now, which runs on all the other Android phones. The tech giant wants Assistant to serve as a more worthy foe to Apple's Siri, and our testing shows that it more than holds its own. Fingerprint sensor In 2016, the question is no longer whether a flagship phone has a fingerprint sensor, but whether it's on the phone's frontside (in the home button slot below the screen) or backside (just below the camera). Modular build Lenovo swung for the fence with the modular Moto Z, which snaps various "Mods" into place using built-in magnets. Most of them are gimmicky (things like a speaker or projector), but the battery mod is the most elegant solution we've seen to adding battery life to a phone. Well, except, perhaps, for the LG V20's removable battery. Stylus With the Note 7 disappearing in a cloud of smoke (in some cases, literally), we're left without any major flagships with integrated stylus support. Software Every phone here that isn't an iPhone runs some version of Android, but not all are created equal. The Google Pixel's OS is the best of the Android bunch, with a pure version of the new Android Nougat that's intertwined with the hardware to a degree that you don't typically see on Android. OnePlus and Motorola come close to using stock Android, with no egregious UI changes, but their flagships are currently stuck on Google's 2015 OS release, Marshmallow. Samsung, LG and (to a lesser degree) HTC add their own UI customizations and marketing-focused features to the Android base. For more on iOS 10, running on the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, you can check out our full review. Release The oldest phones in this group are the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge, which means they're likely to be replaced by successors the soonest, with HTC not far behind. Starting price (full retail) You may have noticed that the OnePlus 3, while holding its own throughout this comparison, didn't have any standout categories. Well, here it is: You can order the phone for a mere US$399 full retail, nearly half of what you'd pay for its best rivals. The rest of the phones have more traditional (you could say "iPhone-like") premium pricing. The V20 gets an asterisk, though, since its full-retail price varies wildly, from $672 (Verizon) all the way up to $830 (AT&T).

The response addresses a supplementary statement of objections the European Commission sent to Google this summer. The commission's original statement of objections narrowly defined online shopping services to exclude services like Amazon, and it failed to take into account the broader dynamics of online shopping, which is "robustly competitive," according to Google General Counsel Kent Walker. The revision "didn't offer a new theory, but argued that, because sites like Amazon sometimes pay price comparison aggregator sites for referred traffic, they can't also be considered rivals," he wrote in Google's response. However, Amazon "gets only a tiny fraction of its traffic from these services," Walker pointed out. Google's Objections Consumers use various means to locate merchant sites, including general search engines, specialist search services, merchant platforms, social media sites and online ads, Walker wrote. They also use dedicated apps from merchants, which in Europe is the most common way consumers shop online, he noted. The EC thinks online shoppers look for products on a search engine, click on a price comparison site, then visit merchant sites, Walker suggested, but recent surveys in Germany and the United States show that many online shoppers in both countries go first to Amazon. Further, Amazon lets consumers compare product features and prices, and buy products for next-day delivery, "which makes [it] an even stronger competitor," he pointed out. There's no meaningful correlation between the evolution of Google's search services and the performance of price comparison sites, Walker maintained, noting that over the past decade a "rapidly increasing amount" of traffic flowed from Google's search pages to Amazon, eBay and other popular sites. The commission's revised statement of objections suggests that Google refrain from using specialized algorithms to highlight the most relevant ads for users, and instead highlight ads from price comparison sites, but "forcing us to direct more clicks to price comparison aggregators would just subsidize sites that have become less useful for consumers," Walker argued. Deconstructing Google's Position Google's arguments essentially split into two areas, said Mark Skilton, a professor of practice in the Warwick Business School at The University of Warwick. One is how tactical digital businesses like price comparison sites are distinct for their services; the other is Google's role as an intermediary for traffic to other sites. "My view is, they're missing one big point about market size and dominance versus consumer choice of services," Skilton told the E-Commerce Times. "Google is not a public utility or a self-appointed one, and this problem is exacerbated by its own algorithms in search as they walk a fine line between service arbiter and service delivery." Even the statistical arguments about traffic volume "are not relevant, as what's at stake is a separation of utility services and next-generation Internet of Things and 5G-type super services and super-data highways for smart cities and smart transport," Skilton noted. "Google is well placed for that next expansion and the EU is on the back foot here," Skilton argued. "Splitting up Google is self destructive, and the EU has failed in its single digital market idea that, ironically, is to Google's advantage." Putting the Squeeze on Google "The point of this exercise is to extort money out of Google and fend off competition with home-grown equivalents," said Michael Jude, a program manager at Stratecast/Frost & Sullivan. Google "can't win this on the merits," he told the E-Commerce Times. The EU's assertion that Google has a special position that it uses to depress competitive offerings "is close to the truth," said Jude, "but not the complete truth."

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Mail Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple Google’s adding WebVR support to Android, desktop versions of Chrome Kyle Wiggers Digital TrendsNovember 7, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share WebVR, the nascent web standard that promises to stream virtual reality apps and games directly to mobile and PC-tethered headsets, is heading to Chrome. It'll launch on both Android and desktop later this year.More Virtual reality may live strictly within smartphone apps and PC software for now, but that won’t be the case for much longer. On Monday, at the W3C’s Workshop on Web & Virtual Reality in San Jose, California, Google announced plans to ship a version of its Chrome internet browser with support for WebVR, a technology that facilitates the delivery of VR apps and games directly from websites. WebVR is the product of the World Wide Web Consortium, the governing internet body that proposes web standards for implementation in browsers, sites, and other web incarnations. It  leverages WebGL, an API used to render 3D content inside of web browsers, and its latest iteration, version 1.1, comprises guidelines and best practices for web VR content formulated by Mozilla, Google, and others. The eventual goal: VR games and apps that can be streamed directly from the internet to mobile, stand-alone, and PC-tethered VR hardware such as the HTC Vive and Oculus Rift. More: Exclusive: Google will take VR to the streets with Daydream pop-up shop in NYC Sketchfab perhaps comes the closest to realizing WebVR’s vision. The latest release of the web-based 3D modeling tool allows you to view scenes inside a VR headset, provided you’re using a supported web browser and headset. Megan Lindsay, Google’s WebVR product manager, said that the Mountain View, California, company hoped to release a public version of Chrome on Android with support for WebVR 1.1 in January. It will be preceded by a beta in December. Signs of integration have already begun appearing. Chromium evangelist François Beaufort spotted settings in the beta and developer versions of Chrome for Android related to WebVR, accessible by typing “chrome://flags/#enable-vr-shell” in the browser’s URL bar. More: Google wants VR to work far better on Android phones with “Daydream” Desktop support will take a bit longer. Google expects Chrome for PC and Mac hardware to gain limited WebVR support in early 2017, with a full rollout to follow later in the year. Google’s initially targeting Daydream, its VR platform for smartphones. It takes the form of unified solution for headsets and smartphones: Daydream devices ship with a motion-sensing remote control, a home screen and navigational overlay, and a highly optimized framework. It’s supported on Google’s Pixel phones and select handsets from third-party manufacturers like ZTE (the Axon 7) and Asus (the Zenfone 3 Delux), and headsets including Google’s View, Zeiss’s VR One Plus, and ZTE’s VR. In related news, Lidsay said that development of a Chrome “VR Shell,” an interface that will let 2D websites not programmed for WebVR to viewed in VR, was underway. If all goes according to plan, it will launch in the first half of next year on Chrome for Android. More: Google Chrome’s “VR Shell” would let you view any website in virtual reality Chrome won’t be the first web browser to support WebVR. Microsoft announced support for the standard in September — a forthcoming version of Edge, the default browser in Windows 10 that replaced Internet Explorer, will integrate the standard, and experimental releases of Mozilla’s Firefox support it in a limited fashion. But it won’t be the last. Apple has yet to announce plans to support WebVR.

Amy Gesenhues on November 7, 2016 at 12:30 pm More In addition to posting an Election Day reminder doodle and offering up an interactive tool that helps voters find polling locations, Google will be delivering real-time election results directly in search after the polls close tomorrow. “Starting when the polls close on Election Day, you will be able to find US election results integrated right into your Google searches in over 30 languages around the world,” writes Google Search VP of Engineering Shashi Thakur, in a blog post shared on the Official Google Blog, Google’s Politics and Elections Blog and the official YouTube Blog. Google says searchers will be able to find results for the presidential, senatorial, congressional and gubernatorial races, along with results for state-level referendums and ballot propositions. (While Google did not name a specific query that would surface results, the animated GIF included “election results” as the search term.) According to the blog post, YouTube will also be airing live election coverage starting at 7:00 p.m. ET on Election Day: Tune in to live coverage from NBC, PBS, MTV, Bloomberg, Telemundo and The Young Turks to keep up with all of the action as it happens. Complex News will also be delivering live coverage during a special election event from YouTube Space NY. Google reports a 233-percent increase in “how to vote” queries this year compared to the 2012 election year. It also says that since the presidential debates, users have spent over 20 million hours watching and rewatching the debates on YouTube.

Follow TechnoBuffalo We already knew Google Home would use similar technology to the Chromecast. Now, we have confirmation the two are almost identical—at least internally. In a new teardown from iFixit, it’s revealed the Home’s processor, flash memory and RAM and the exact same chips found in the second-generation Chromecast. The only real difference is Google added an audio amplifier, which was needed since Home is a smart speaker. Aside from that, there’s not much to Google Home. The good news is Google Home got a good repairability score, as many of the components are modular and can be replaced individually. However, iFixit says a few of the pieces are hard to take apart, so inexperienced tinkerers might find it hard to repair. Is Google Home worth it? In our review of Google Home, we found the smart speaker to be a worthy competitor to the Amazon Echo. However, it’s still unable to perform basic functions, which means it has a long road ahead before it’s the best smart speaker on the market. The fact that it’s only $129 as opposed to the Echo’s asking price of $179 is a good start. Now, it just needs a few tweaks and Google Home will be everything Echo is and more.

The new series represents the NFL's first VR production, following a series of experiments last season. It is being acquired using Google' s Jump 360-degree camera system. The series is set to debut on the NFL channel on YouTube on Thursday, November 24 — Thanksgiving Day. Later in the year, episodes will also be available on an NFL VR app for Google's Daydream mobile VR hardware for the Google Pixel and Pixel XL, which launches for $79 this Thursday, the NFL said. The deal makes sense for Google — exclusive NFL content is exactly the shot in the arm it needs as it launches its new headsets in a market that's getting more crowded all the time. "Virtual reality … is an exciting new medium to explore as we look to evolve and grow our offerings," said NFL SVP of Digital Media Vishal Shah in a prepared statement. "This partnership with Google is an important step in that direction." The first episode will cover the Philadelphia Eagles defensive line, including game-day footage gathered on the Eagles bench and sideline. Future episodes will cover the Miami Dolphins cheerleaders, Green Bay, WI, football culture and the San Diego Chargers, the NFL said.  The NFL said clips on its official YouTube channel, launched last year, have earned over a billion views.

Oct. 30, 2016 10:19 p.m. ET 1 COMMENTS How do big ideas get turned into reality? X is the “moonshot factory” for Google parent Alphabet Inc.—a place to work on projects, like autonomous vehicles, that have the potential to radically reshape the world. To get insights into how the operation works, and why it celebrates failure, The Wall Street Journal’s Rebecca Blumenstein spoke with Astro Teller, captain of the factory. Here are edited excerpts of their conversation. Picking and choosing MS. BLUMENSTEIN: How do you decide which projects to tackle? MR. TELLER: There has to be some huge problem with the world that we can name and say that we’re excited about going to tackle. Then there has to be a radical proposed solution for solving that problem. And there has to be some specific set of technologies which look really hard, that if we could get working, would enable that radical proposed solution.

IBM’s Big Bet on Artificial Intelligence The Case for the AT&T-Time Warner Deal Will Kobe Bryant Score Again? MS. BLUMENSTEIN: You take a certain amount of excitement in killing projects. MR. TELLER: All things being equal, I would rather that a project succeed than go away. I would reframe the statement this way. If your project isn’t going to make it, if it has an Achilles' heel, do we want to find out about that now, or should we spend tens of millions of dollars and find out about that two or three years from now? Astro Teller talks about the most difficult parts of building a roady-ready driverless car. MS. BLUMENSTEIN: There is a lot of impatience in the market for Google’s car. MR. TELLER: Getting a car to not drive off the road on a highway is not hard. Working better than a human in all of the situations that a human does that is four or five orders of magnitude harder. We’ve done 2 million miles of driving. To not drift out of your lane, good. But when someone walks out into the road holding a stop sign in their hand, you have to stop. If our car can’t do that and 10,000 other things like that, then we, nor is any company, ready to be on the road. MS. BLUMENSTEIN: You’re in the process of graduating the car. What does that mean? MR. TELLER: We separated their finances from X’s finances on January 1st. They have a lot of corporate legal stuff to do before they’re fully graduated. When Verily, our life-sciences business, graduated last year, it took them an entire year to check all these different boxes. Even once they were mostly graduated, they were still relying on us for a lot of services. We’re going through that with the self-driving car group. I would say the same thing about the cars themselves. You don’t want us to all of a sudden have every car in the world be driving themselves. You want every step to be rational and clear and borderline boring, because that’s probably what’s safe. MS. BLUMENSTEIN: You’re launching balloons that deliver high-speed internet access to the developing world. MR. TELLER: There are about four billion people in the world who have poor or no internet access. What if you could make something like a supercheap satellite, but hang it under a balloon, launching it for a thousandth the cost of putting up a normal satellite? But the winds are very unforgiving in the stratosphere. You can’t put a big gas tank on it and a propeller. The wind is too strong, the balloons make too big a surface area, too big a sail, basically. What if instead of fighting winds we went up and down? It takes almost no energy to go up and down a few kilometers. What if we taught the balloons to get super smart at knowing which way the wind would be blowing and how fast at different altitudes? We had a balloon stay over Peru for about three months. And then come home, back to California. Astro Teller says that when developing a breakthrough, teams should focus on the most difficult parts of a problem before anything else. Glass half full MS. BLUMENSTEIN: Let’s talk about Google Glass, a product that many say wasn’t a commercial success. MR. TELLER: More of our professional and personal lives are mediated by technology. Figuring out a way for there not to be cognitive dissonance created by our physical lives and digital lives is very important. Google Glass took good steps in the right direction. We could’ve done a better job of signaling to the world and reminding ourselves that the thing we built was a learning prototype. It wasn’t a finished product.

In August researchers discovered Android malware that was distributed through the Google Adsense advertising network.The malware tried to steal internet banking data and was automatically saved as an Android executable (APK file) to the SD card of the Android device. “This behavior surprised us: typically, the browser warns users about downloading a potentially dangerous file, and offers them a choice of whether or not to save the file,” Kaspersky Lab researcher Nikita Buchka writes in a blog on the website of the Russian antivirus vendor. When informed, Google quickly blocked the malicious advertisements. The researchers then tried to figure out why Chrome allowed the download. They found that the cybercriminals behind the malware used a smart trick to save the APK file to the SD card. They simulated a click on a download link, that was hidden inside a malcious advertisement. When the click on the download link was simulated, the APK file was downloaded in several parts and each part was encrypted. By using this method, the cybercriminals bypassed the download notification that Chrome would normally show and that would ask the user whether he wanted to save the file. When the download was succesful, the malware still had to become active and to achieve that, the APK still had to be installed. To convince an user to install the APK, it tried to pretend being an update of a popular app. Google has now patched the issue. Users who don’t browse with Chrome on Android are not affected by the issue, they are asked whether they want to save the file or not.

RenewAmerica.com November 14, 2016 Click here to receive our twice-weekly Newsletter Home Forum Analysis Links Documents Activism About Contact   Cliff Kincaid November 7, 2016 "People power" versus manipulation of the masses By Cliff Kincaid On November 8, the election will come down to Donald J. Trump's "people power," a largely spontaneous uprising of the "silent majority," against Hillary Clinton's scientific manipulation of the electorate, using personal data to identify and provoke people to go to the polls. In this effort, Mrs. Clinton has the support of the giant company Google and the president of its parent company, Eric Schmidt. Experts say the effort resembles how the Communist Chinese dictatorship monitors people and modifies their behavior through media manipulation and censorship of the Web. As Trump suggests, the election process seems "rigged," and the evidence has come in the form of another John Podesta email. One of the internal Clinton campaign emails disclosed by WikiLeaks shows that Schmidt, chairman of the Google parent company, offered a detailed campaign plan for the Clinton campaign. The April 15, 2014, message, addressed to Clinton aide Cheryl Mills, said, "I have put together my thoughts on the campaign ideas and I have scheduled some meetings in the next few weeks for veterans of the campaign to tell me how to make these ideas better." The details included "Size, Structure and Timing" and a campaign budget of $1.5 billion, with more than "5000 paid employees and million(s) of volunteers." The Schmidt email was sent along to several key Clinton people, including campaign chairman John Podesta. The plan examines how information is received and reviewed by voters, and what provokes them. Indeed, in a section titled "The Voter," Schmidt says, "Key is the development of a single record for a voter that aggregates all that is known about them. In 2016 smart phones will be used to identify, meet, and update profiles on the voter." Schmidt goes on to say, "For each voter, a score is computed ranking probability of the right vote. Analytics can model demographics, social factors and many other attributes of the needed voters." Patrick Wood, editor of Technocracy News, comments that Schmidt's scoring idea "is just like China's social scoring of citizens to see who is for them and who is against them." On one level, this means that search engine results are manipulated. In his evaluation of the Schmidt email, Michael Cantrell comments, "For some time now, people have wondered if Google, the world's largest search engine, might be a tad bit slanted when it comes to politics, favoring left-wing candidates over conservatives in how search results are displayed. Well, it seems those suspicions may not be so far-fetched after all." Earlier this year, in a column carried by Accuracy in Media, Seton Motley documented how Google was designing its search engine to maneuver people away from the issue of Hillary Clinton's health problems. It's a fact of life that in this era of access to many different sources of information, some people go to the Google search engine and rely on the first item that pops up. That's how I got banned (temporarily) from the campus of the State University of New York at New Paltz. A feminist professor used Google to search my name and passed around derogatory information from the first source on the search engine page – the Southern Poverty Law Center. She then passed around the information, creating a stink that caused the campus administration to cancel the debate I was scheduled to participate in. A new book, Islamic Jihad, Cultural Marxism and the Transformation of the West, examines the role of Google as a new media "gatekeeper" that determines how people see the reality of the world. The author, William Mayer of PipeLineNews.org, examines how Google produces search engine results on the subject of Islamic terrorism that play down criminal activities of leading Jihadists. Mayer says the results can be confusing unless the search terms are assembled with scrupulous precision, "a difficult task when one isn't exactly sure in advance the extent of the associations being pursued." In his excellent book, Mayer documents in detail the "leftist/Obama/Media merger" that played a significant role in Obama's 2012 victory and figures prominently in Hillary Clinton's plan for victory on Tuesday. Mayer comments, "...if we think of the Internet as the largest depository of information ever to be created, it assumes in many sense the role of the book of common wisdom. When the universal storehouse of information obfuscates and hides knowledge it becomes censorious, preventing or at least stifling access to non-ideologically approved ideas and information." When Barack Obama campaigns against Trump by citing the KKK, you can rest assured this has been determined by analysts in the Hillary campaign to be at least somewhat effective in scaring blacks. Getting blacks to vote against Trump is a part of what they hope will be their winning strategy. Similarly, when Hillary Clinton campaigns with a profane rapper named Jay Z, the calculation has been made by some brain in the campaign structure that using such a spectacle will inspire other blacks to turn out for the former secretary of state on Election Day. Hillary hopes that the rapper's popularity will somehow rub off on her. These two campaign events are more evidence of how truly "scientific" the progressive movement has become. People are perceived by the Clinton campaign as subjects to be manipulated. Even with the use of these scientific techniques, victory is not assured for the "progressive" forces. That is why reports of vote fraud are mounting as Obama sounds the alarm about the KKK. For Trump to win, the "silent majority" will have to be a real majority with millions of votes to spare, surpassing the artificially created "progressive" bloc bolstered by fraudulent votes and created by an emerging technocratic dictatorship of access to information. The "media monopoly" that the left used to rail against is now controlled by them. © Cliff Kincaid   The views expressed by RenewAmerica columnists are their own and do not necessarily reflect the position of RenewAmerica or its affiliates.

Apple Inc. sparked the smartphone revolution, but Android spread it to the masses. The software backed by Google parent company Alphabet Inc. powers more than 85 percent of the roughly 1.5 billion new smartphones sold each year. Yet for all its success, Android looks increasingly in danger of falling apart.  Android World Smartphones powered by Google's Android technology are by far the most popular computing devices in the world Source: Bloomberg Intelligence and IDC Note: 2016 figure is an estimate published in September. That's because the companies that teamed up to make Android a hit -- principally Google and Samsung Electronics Co. -- are increasingly working at cross purposes. Google has just started to sell its first smartphone that competes with its ostensible partner Samsung, and for now it has kept for itself crucial voice-assistant technology that makes the Google phones more appealing than those of other Android manufacturers.  Now Samsung plans to use its own digital assistant for smartphones in competition with Google. Other makers of Android smartphone handsets, principally Chinese firms such as Xiaomi Corp., have also extricated themselves from parts of the Android system. Once successful Google hardware partners, including HTC Corp. and Lenovo Group Ltd., are struggling with their smartphone businesses and are no longer useful Android allies. Coalitions only hold together if all the partners are successful and share common interests. That's no longer a given with Android.  Market Share of Android Smartphones 87.6% Google started backing Android in the first place because it was worried Apple (and Microsoft, and the phone companies) could find ways to disadvantage or block Google's web search on smartphones. Android was Google's effort to build its own smartphone playground and ensure Google stayed relevant as more computing activities moved from PC web browsers to mobile gadgets. That strategy panned out. But controlling the operating system no longer gives Google a guarantee to siphon and harness all the world's digital information. The more time people spend using Facebook, Snapchat or Siri on their phones -- even on Android phones -- the more data is being generating out of Google's reach. Wresting back some of that power and consumer information is a significant motivation behind Google's efforts to create smartphones that it designs and controls from the chips to the apps. For their part, Samsung and other handset makers know they can no longer rely on Google for their mobile existence. Samsung agreed in October to buy Viv Labs, a startup working on a Siri-like voice technology. In China and India, local companies sell Android smartphones with local versions of app stores in place of Google Play. In some cases, it's possible to use Android smartphones without interacting much with Google. All these moves are signs of the fraying Android coalition. The coalition of the willing isn't willing anymore. It isn't unusual for cracks to emerge in tech alliances. Partners Microsoft, Intel and personal computer manufacturers haven't always been on the same page about the Windows operating system -- a business that mirrors Android in many ways. At times, PC hardware makers felt as if Microsoft was getting the better end of the deal. While Microsoft got rich on Windows software, PC hardware makers were left to fight over single-digit percentage profit margins at best from making and selling Windows computers. In the Android alliance, Google makes the lion's share of the profits, too.  King of Android Google's parent company generates far higher profits than Samsung, the most successful manufacturer of Android smartphones Source: Company disclosures In short, it's hard to stay friends for long in the technology industry, as Google is finding out.  The Windows coalition has held through the turmoil, though Windows never branched far beyond personal computers and computer servers to other devices. The PC is now a fringe of computing, and Windows isn't even the heart of Microsoft anymore. It's not clear how this all shakes out for Android and Google. In contrast to Windows, Android is moving far beyond the smartphone into powering thermostats, web streaming gadgets hooked up to televisions and virtual reality headsets. But if the coalition can't stay together, the big risk is Android turns out to be a crucial technology, but not an enduring one -- the laser disc player of computing.  This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners. Samsung has also developed its own smartphone operating system, Tizen, as an alternative to Android. But Tizen has never gone anywhere.  To contact the author of this story: Shira Ovide in New York at sovide@bloomberg.net To contact the editor responsible for this story: Daniel Niemi at dniemi1@bloomberg.net Flight Tracker Flight Tracker Of the four airlines Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway recently bought stakes in, analysts see the most upside at Southwest and Delta: Source: Bloomberg Taking Flight Berkshire Is Back on Board With Airlines Industrials Tara Lachapelle Deflated Deflated Shares in luxury makers Kate Spade and Michael Kors have fallen from their peaks, while other luxury goods companies struggle to sustain gains Source: Bloomberg Not Your Bag LVMH Doesn't Need What Michael Kors Is Selling Consumer Shelly Banjo A Year to Forget A Year to Forget ConocoPhillips' stock has lagged behind its larger rivals in 2016 Source: Bloomberg Twofer ConocoPhillips Was Right to Split Energy Liam Denning Amneal deal would be $8 billion Alternative Medicine Rummaging in the Medicine Cabinet Health Chris Hughes Pound's best month since 2009 The Surreal World Trump Is No Cure for Brexit's $82 Billion Gap Finance Lionel Laurent Siemens is paying $4.5 billion Mentor Merger Siemens's Expensive Tastes Industrials Chris Bryant Easy Listening Easy Listening Samsung's $8 billion cash purchase of Harman International is its largest to date Source: Bloomberg Note: Includes acquisitions and investments for Samsung Electronics Co.

In a blog post regarding the update, Google explains that this is the "biggest overhaul of the app in nearly four years," when version 2.0 arrived. DON'T MISS: Apple just released iOS 10.2 beta 2 Although the Gmail app functions similarly to how it always has, Google refreshed the UI, made the transitions smoother and added several features that users have been requesting for months or even years. The most welcome change for many Gmail app users will be the ability to swipe to archive or delete message. This has become a standard feature in virtually every popular mobile mail app, but somehow, it hadn't made its way to Gmail. Google has also brought the embarrassment-saving Undo Send feature to the Gmail app, allowing users to quickly "unsend" an email when you spot a typo or realize you forget to include the attachment you were supposed to send. Finally, the Gmail app will now offer instant results and spelling suggestions from the search bar, so the next time you search the word "flighht," the app will know that you probably meant "flight" instead. I haven't personally used the Gmail app in years, but it's somewhat shocking that this feature is only being added now. Still, better late than never for those who prefer the official app. Along with the Gmail update, Google is also refreshing the Calendar app, bringing new month and week in landscape views as well as support for Spotlight Search. If you use Google's mobile apps on iOS, be sure to update today.

Follow TechnoBuffalo Google on Monday pushed out a major overhaul to its Gmail app for iOS, finally bringing feature parity to its Android counterpart. The most noticeable difference is the presence of Google’s Material Design, which helps create a “fresh new look” that includes better transitions and a faster experience overall. Finally, the app doesn’t feel like it’s simply a wrapper for the mobile website. Unfortunately, users still don’t get a universal inbox. However, the update does feature Undo Send and an improved search that Google claims will return instant results. Here’s the full changelog, according to Google: Undo Send: prevent embarrassing mistakes Search: find things faster with instant results and spelling suggestions Swipe to archive/delete: quickly clear out your inbox A better Gmail experience The lack of a universal inbox is probably a deal breaker for a lot of folks—it is for more—but if you only have one email account, Gmail is an excellent option. Google also said its Calendar app for iOS is getting a much-needed update as well, introducing month and week views, as well as Spotlight search support. You can get the Gmail and Calendar updates for iOS now. Source Google Topics #Google #Gmail #Google Calendar Brandon Russell Brandon Russell enjoys writing about technology and entertainment.

Samsung started preorders on Nov. 6 for its latest Gear S3 Frontier and Classic smartwatches, which will be generally available for purchase on Nov. 18. The Gear S3 smartwatches, which start at $350, include the Frontier watch in two versions—a WiFi and Bluetooth model, and a WiFi, Bluetooth and LTE model—as well as the Classic model, which is equipped only with WiFi and Bluetooth connectivity. The Frontier model has more rugged styling while the Classic version looks more like a traditional digital watch and has a sleeker look that's designed to appeal to business professionals. Huawei has launched its latest wearable device, the $130 Huawei Fit sports watch, which provides multi-sport fitness tracking, heart rate and sleep monitoring, automatic step counting and more on a circular always-on display. Huawei designed the Fit to bridge the gap between a full smartwatch and a dedicated fitness tracker. The Huawei Fit has an aluminum body that comes in two finishes, Moonlight Silver and Titanium Grey. Three wrist band colors will be available—black, which is available exclusively at Best Buy through early January—blue and orange. Following the exclusive Best Buy arrangement, the devices will also be sold through Amazon, Newegg and other retailers. The Fit features a 1.04-inch circular black and white touch-screen display, 256KB of memory, 16MB of on-board storage and an 80mAh rechargeable battery that lasts up to six days on a charge with normal use. Google's efforts to push broad adoption of Rich Communication Services for cross-operator messaging on mobile devices appear to be gaining traction. The company announced on Nov. 4 that it has launched RCS messaging for Sprint customers that are using Android phones. The new support will allow Android users to conduct group chats, send high-resolution photos, receive and read receipts, and generally do more with chat than they currently are able to with standard Short Message Service. Sprint subscribers will see RCS support in Messenger for Android becoming available in 2017. All new Android devices from Sprint will have the RCS-enabled version of Messenger enabled by default on their systems starting next year. In recent months Intel has been demonstrating how aerial drones can be used for entertainment purposes. The company set a world record earlier this year by putting 100 drones into the air simultaneously, all of which were controlled by a single pilot. But on Nov. 4, Intel unveiled a new drone designed specifically for light shows and announced that the company in October had set a new Guinness World Record by having 500 of the drones—called the Intel Shooting Star—in the air at the same time, again being controlled by a single pilot in a demonstration presented in Germany.       Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows IBM Aims Watson at Embodied Cognition Microsoft Advances 'Any Developer, Any App, Any Platform' Strategy Google Will Tag Frequent Violators of Its Site Safety Standards Intel Lights Up the Sky With New Shooting Star Drone Old School Polling Methods Hid Trump's Popularity With Voters 10 Reasons Not to Buy the Apple MacBo...

RSS ALL ARTICLES FEATURES ONLY   TRIVIA Search How-To Geek How to Set Up Google Home Google Home is a new entrant in the voice assistant device market, where the Amazon Echo has reigned as the unopposed victor for nearly two years. Here’s how to set up your Google Home device and begin issuing voice commands completely hands-free. What Is Google Home and Why Would I Want One? Google Home is essentially Google’s version of the Amazon Echo. It lets you do pretty much the same things that you can do with your Android’s voice assistant, but without pulling out your phone to use it. Instead, it’s a standalone device that sits on your desk, countertop, or side table and is always ready to go whenever you want to ask a question or issue a voice command. If you don’t already have an Amazon Echo but are wanting to see what all the fuss is about, getting the Google Home is an alternative you can look into, especially since it only costs $129, whereas the Echo is priced at $179. Granted, the Echo is probably a better option right now, as it supports more smarthome devices, but the Google Home has a few exclusive features of its own—like access to Google’s mass library of knowledge, or the ability to control your Chromecast (which Amazon can’t do). RELATED ARTICLES How to Set Up and Configure Your Amazon Echo The Amazon Echo Is What Makes Smarthome Worthwhile How to Set Up Your Google Home Setting Up the Google Home takes only just a few minutes, after which you’ll be off to the races. Once you plug in the device, it will automatically boot up and from there you’ll need to download the Google Home app to your phone, which is available for iOS and Android. Open up the app and tap on “Accept” at the bottom-right corner of the screen. The app will inform you that your Google Home was found. Hit “Continue” to begin the setup process. When the app connects to your Google Home, the device will play a test sound to confirm that it’s connected. Tap on “Play Test Sound” to begin that process. Tap on “I Heard the Sound” in the bottom-right corner if you heard the Google Home device emit a sound. If not, select “Try Again”. On the next screen, you’ll select which room your Google Home device is in. Simply tap on “Select a room” and choose a room. Once that’s done, hit “Continue” down at the bottom. Next, you’ll connect your Google Home to your Wi-Fi network. Tap on “Select a Wi-Fi network” and select yours from the list. Enter in the password for your Wi-Fi network and hit “Continue” at the bottom. Once it’s connected to your Wi-Fi, tap on “Sign In”. If you’re already logged in to other Google apps on your phone, your Google account should automatically pop up. Tap on “Continue as [your name]”. If not, you’ll need to sign into your Google account before continuing. On the next screen, you’ll be asked if Google Home can access your personal information, such as your calendar, notes, flight info, and so on. This allows Google Home to provide you with better results with certain voice commands (like asking what’s on your agenda for today). Keep in mind that anyone within speaking range can access this info. Select either “Allow” or “Skip” at the bottom. The next step is setting your location and giving Google permission to access it. The app will try to pinpoint your location, but if it’s off in any way, you can hit the pencil icon off to the right and enter in your location manually. Once you’re done, tap on “Set Location” down at the bottom. On the next screen, you can choose whether or not you want to get email notifications about the latest news and info about Google Home. Use the toggle switch on the right and then hit “Continue”. Next, you’ll select which music streaming provider you want to use with your Google Home. Obviously, Google Play Music and YouTube Music are options, but you can also link to Spotify or Pandora. Hit “Continue” when you’re done to move onto the next step. After that, you may get a message saying that your Google Home is still updating, so sit tight for a few moments and wait for it to finish. Once it’s done updating, it will need to reboot. Tap on “Reboot” in the bottom-right corner. Once it reboots, the app will say that setup as completed. Hit “Continue” to move onto the tutorial or select “Skip Tutorial”. The tutorial consists of nothing more than giving you a few voice commands you can use and shows you how to use them. Hit “Finish Tutorial” on the last screen to exit out of it. You’ll then be taken to the Google Home’s settings screen (where it might be a good idea to explore and see what you can customize). Tapping on the back arrow in the top-left corner will take you to the app’s “Devices” screen where your Google Home will appear in the list. At this point, your Google Home is ready to go and you can begin using it. Simply say “Ok Google” and Google Home will start listening. After that, the world is your oyster.

(Google) Share Written by Mike Murphy Obsession Machines with Brains November 07, 2016 If Google could control every aspect of your life, would you let it? What if it did a really good job at it? Two years ago, Amazon released the Echo, a voice-controlled speaker that can play music, read you the news, control your internet-of-things devices with ease, and help you buy things from Amazon. Since then, it’s become a sort of sleeper hit in the US, with estimates suggesting Amazon has sold over 4 million units since its launch. It pretty much stood alone for a while as the only simple, useful device of its kind. But this past summer, Google announced that it would be unveiling a device called Home, which did pretty much everything the Echo could do, but in a smaller, cheaper package, and with the might of Google’s internet-trawling knowledge behind it. The Home went on sale online and in-store at big-box retailers over the weekend. Should Amazon be worried about the Home? Probably. Does anyone need a device like this? Maybe. Quartz spent the week with a Home in their living room, testing to see if it can stand up to the Echo, and figuring out whether it might be worth replacing an Echo, or if it’s useful enough to bring the Home into your home. What’s good It works well. The Home can pull in music from YouTube Music, Spotify, Pandora, Google Play Music, and Tunein, so pretty much whatever major music service you use, you can listen to it at your command. If you ask it a question, it will almost certainly be able give you an acceptable answer. It sounds good. I never found the sound quality on the Echo to be particularly terrible, but with its four speakers (compared to the Echo’s two), the sound on the Home is a little richer, and a little less tinny. Turn it up to full volume, and it definitely has the power to blow out a small apartment in Queens. It’s easy to control. Just say “OK Google,” and Home will be ready to respond. You can also turn the device’s volume up and down by asking it to “turn it up/down” or by using the touch interface on the slanted face of the device. It’s easy to set up. Google makes it very simple to set up the Home. You plug the device in, download the Home app (which is the same app that you use to control a Chromecast), connect to the device’s wireless network, and then connect it to your wireless network. In all, setup took me about three minutes. It can control your home. If you have smart devices in your home, Home can be the hub that controls them all for you. It can tie into devices made by Google (Nest and Chromecast), Philips, and Samsung SmartThings. You can also create rules on IFTTT, allowing Home to do multiple things at once. For example, you can set it up so that when you say it’s “party time,” your Philips Hue lightbulbs will change colors. But you shouldn’t do any of this, because smart homes are a bad idea. Home is also supposed to be able to control Chromecasts as well, meaning if you have one of Google’s streaming devices plugged into a TV and on the same wifi network, you should be able to ask Home to play a YouTube clip on your TV. I had a first-generation Chromecast set up on the same network as the Home, and the app told me that the Chromecast wasn’t supported by Home for this function, but then a few hours later I tried anyway, and it worked perfectly. You can have a conversation with it. Unlike many other voice assistants, Google’s Assistant can actually remember context, meaning if you ask for the weather today, and then follow up just saying, “What about tomorrow?” it will be able to infer from your previous question that you mean the weather in your area for tomorrow, rather than having to restate what you’re asking about. It works on a range of questions, too. You can ask it, “What’s the best Chinese restaurant in the area?” follow up with, “How about Mexican restaurants?” and then “Which one is the cheapest?” and it won’t lose its train of thought. It seems to know everything. You can ask Home random questions about nearly any person, place, or idea, and it generally seems to be able to find an answer. This is almost certainly because Home has Google’s vast catacombs of knowledge behind it, so anything you could put into a Google search bar should work with Home. This becomes pretty apparent for more esoteric questions, where Home seems to just read directly from Google Knowledge Graph answers in certain cases (more on that below). The Echo, on the other hand, often fails to understand questions about people or places. It listens on multiple devices. This is very smart: If you have multiple devices, like a Pixel and a Home, with Google Assistant within earshot, they will all start listening when you say “OK Google,” but only one device will respond. It’s not entirely clear how the devices decide who is going to answer, but I’m guessing the phones defer to Homes because they’re louder. The price. The Home costs $130, whereas an Echo costs $180 full-price. Amazon recently knocked the price down to $140, ostensibly because it’s “Alexa’s second birthday,” but presumably also because it’s feeling the pressure from Google’s device that does as much, if not more than its own, for less money. It’s customizable. Although neither the Echo or the Home are particularly good-looking devices—the Echo looks like the GM Tower in Detroit and the Home kind of looks like an essential oil diffuser—but at least the Home can be updated to match your, erm, home, a little better than the Echo. The Home’s fabric bottom cover comes in seven colors, which you’ll be able to purchase from Google soon. What’s not so good It’s a bit slow. The Home definitely seems to take a few more beats to answer questions and pull up songs than the Echo does, but in both cases, you’re asking a small cylinder to magically pull information for you from a distributed set of servers across the globe instantaneously, which they both do dutifully. So it’s not exactly a deal-breaker. It’s wordy. Home tends to pretty much understand most things you ask of it, and will generally get you an answer, eventually. If you ask it for the weather where you are, it’ll tell you “Right now in Astoria, New York 11102, it’s currently 73 and mostly cloudy. It’ll be partly cloudy today with a forecasted high of 73 and a low of 52.” Alexa offers a similar response, but doesn’t feel the need to tell me my state or ZIP code. In many other situations, Home will give me the answer I’m after, but cite the source before she starts rattling off its reply. It seems that Home will just recite, in a lot of cases, the answers that you’d get if you typed a question into a Google web search. For example, if you ask it how to get out a red wine stain, it’ll think for a second, and then say: “Okay, here’s some information I found on Real Simple,” and then recite the exact response found in Google’s Knowledge Graph. It’s not that this is necessarily wrong or bad, it’s just worth considering if the amount of information presented in a web-based answer should be the same amount offered by a spoken answer that you can’t pause or restart without asking the question again. Home can’t really do more than one thing at once. If you’re playing music on Home, and ask it a question, and then tell it to stop (because the answer is too wordy, perhaps?), it’ll stop talking, and stop playing your music. If you ask it to start playing again, it’ll start at the beginning. Which is a bit annoying. “OK Google” is a weird thing to say repeatedly. Not that there’s necessarily a phrase that can make it seem particularly normal to talk to a small cylinder in your living room, but “OK Google” sounds like something you’d say when you’re exasperated, or ready to start an argument. Amazon’s choice of the name Alexa as its wake-up word feels a bit more natural, even though its device can’t hold a conversation. I actively hate saying "Okay google" because it makes me so aware I am ~ interacting ~ with a ~ brand ~ — mat honan (@mat) November 1, 2016 It’s also annoying to have to keep repeating “OK Google” to get follow-up answers to questions—which is the case with any digital assistant you’re trying to talk to—it’d be like having a conversation with someone and saying their name every time you answered them. In all of Google’s advertising for the Home, you only hear people ask Home a single question at a time, because after that, it just starts getting weird to keep repeating that phrase. One account at a time. The vast majority of my calendar appointments are on my work email, and although the Google Home app showed both my work and personal accounts in the app, I couldn’t figure out to how get Home to tell me when my next work meeting was. It can’t contact people for you. Google Assistant on the Pixel can email and text people in your contacts for you, but Home cannot. It’d be super useful to be able to fire off a message while your hands are tied up by dictating to Home, but at least if your Pixel is in earshot, it should be able to pick up the Home’s slack. Sometimes you have to get creative with your questions. There are instances where you ask Home what seems like a basic question that it can’t find an answer to, but if you ask for the same information in a different way, it will come back with what you want. For example, asking, “Did the Jets win today?” gives you a confused response, whereas asking, “What is the score in the Jets game today?” will give you the answer you’re after. Then again, perhaps Home was just trying to shield me from reality. (Google) Should you get one? If you don’t have an Echo, and don’t mind Google’s tentacles digging deeper into your digital and physical lives, then the Home is a great purchase. It works well, sounds good, and can keep inquisitive minds sated. And when Home doesn’t know the answer to something, it reminds you that it’s “learning more every day.” That means that, theoretically, this could be the last smart-home hub you ever buy, as Google’s AI will improve over time, and be able to better understand and serve you with each software update. Already, the Home is more knowledgable, easier to use and sounds better than the Echo. That being said, it’s worth considering what the purpose of these sorts of devices are. Smart-home technology is still a nascent field, where technological mishaps can cause you to lose power, have no working lights, or freeze to death because your IoT thermostat switched off. Multiple companies are developing their own standards, and devices like the Home have to act as a middleman between technologies. Beyond that, there are few times when proclaiming something across a room is quicker or less awkward than just pulling out your phone to Google the answer—assuming you don’t live alone. And whether you’re talking about the Echo or the Home, both of these devices are really just insipid ways for two massive tech companies to bleed more money out of loyal customers—the Echo as an easier way to buy more products from Amazon, and the Home as a way to sell YouTube Red subscriptions, songs and films from Google Play Music—and build up their data sets on their users. But if you’re just after a voice-activated speaker that can also answer some questions for you, the Home is the way to go. Read full story home our picks popular latest obsessions search

If you don’t already know, here’s how you can vote and other key details to know going into the polls. Where is my polling place? Just use Google. There are tons of sites that can help you find your polling place. But Google is just easier. The search engine giant allows you to type in your exact address and then locates your polling place, reveals its operating hours and lets you know what you need to bring with you on Election Day. According to Google metrics, 233 percent more people in 2016 have googled “How to Vote” than in 2012. Don’t allow confusion on where to vote be the reason you do not head to the polls. There are other important races   As you know, this is not an election exclusively for who will be our next president. Your vote matters across the board. The Democrats are scrambling hard to retake their majority in the Senate (which they lost in 2014). Politico Magazine has a nice rundown of all the various things that could be determined in different states, including some historic firsts and other ballot initiatives. Let’s not leave any election to chance Some polls have the presidential race between Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and Republican nominee Donald Trump as “neck and neck” in certain battleground states. According to  the New York Times Upshot/Siena College Survey released Monday, the pair are tied at 44 percent in North Carolina. In Ohio, the Columbus Times-Dispatch shows the state at 48 percent for Clinton and 47 percent for Trump. A Quinnipiac University poll shows Clinton at 46 percent and Trump at 45 percent with likely voters in Florida. Nationally, Clinton seems to have the edge. She’s three points ahead in Bloomberg’s final poll. Washington Post-ABC News’ latest tracking poll data shows Clinton at 47 and Trump at 43. But, anything can happen. Do we remember the presidential race of 2000? The outcome came down to some 537 votes cast in Florida. 5-3-7. This election doesn’t appear to be as tightly contested — but who knows what can happen once Election Day is finally here? People have died for your right to cast a ballot Yes, the above statement seems dramatic and designed to guilt you into caring about our country’s future. But it’s not. It’s the reality of America. For African-Americans, the statement rings especially true. From the Fifteenth Amendment to the passing of the the Voting Rights Act of 1965, the fight to obtain and maintain our vote has been arduous and ongoing. Today, African-Americans are having to fight against new ways of voter suppression, with new voter ID laws and voter intimidation tactics. Remember those who died for your right by voting on Election Day. Ashantai Hathaway is a reporter at theGrio.

By Shira Ovide. Added by Agency Staff on 7 November 2016. Saved under Editor's pick Tags: Google, HTC, Lenovo, Microsoft, Samsung, Viv Labs, Xiaomi Tweet The Android operating system for smartphones is one of the most successful technologies ever created. Apple sparked the smartphone revolution, but Android spread it to the masses. The software, backed by Google, powers more than 85% of the roughly 1,5bn new smartphones sold each year. Yet for all its success, Android looks increasingly in danger of falling apart. That’s because the companies that teamed up to make Android a hit — principally Google and Samsung Electronics — are increasingly working at cross purposes. Google has just started to sell its first smartphone that competes with its ostensible partner Samsung, and for now it has kept for itself crucial voice-assistant technology that makes the Google phones more appealing than those of other Android manufacturers. Now Samsung plans to use its own digital assistant for smartphones in competition with Google. Other makers of Android smartphone handsets, principally Chinese firms such as Xiaomi, have also extricated themselves from parts of the Android system. Once successful Google hardware partners, including HTC and Lenovo, are struggling with their smartphone businesses and are no longer useful Android allies. Coalitions only hold together if all the partners are successful and share common interests. That’s no longer a given with Android. Google started backing Android in the first place because it was worried Apple (and Microsoft, and the phone companies) could find ways to disadvantage or block Google’s Web search on smartphones. Android was Google’s effort to build its own smartphone playground and ensure Google stayed relevant as more computing activities moved from PC web browsers to mobile gadgets. That strategy panned out. But controlling the operating system no longer gives Google a guarantee to siphon and harness all the world’s digital information. The more time people spend using Facebook, Snapchat or Siri on their phones — even on Android phones — the more data is being generating out of Google’s reach. Wresting back some of that power and consumer information is a significant motivation behind Google’s efforts to create smartphones that it designs and controls from the chips to the apps. For their part, Samsung and other handset makers know they can no longer rely on Google for their mobile existence. Samsung agreed in October to buy Viv Labs, a start-up working on a Siri-like voice technology. In China and India, local companies sell Android smartphones with local versions of app stores in place of Google Play. In some cases, it’s possible to use Android smartphones without interacting much with Google. All these moves are signs of the fraying Android coalition. The coalition of the willing isn’t willing anymore. It isn’t unusual for cracks to emerge in tech alliances. Partners Microsoft, Intel and PC manufacturers haven’t always been on the same page about the Windows operating system — a business that mirrors Android in many ways. At times, PC hardware makers felt as if Microsoft was getting the better end of the deal. While Microsoft got rich on Windows software, PC hardware makers were left to fight over single-digit percentage profit margins at best from making and selling Windows computers. In the Android alliance, Google makes the lion’s share of the profits, too. In short, it’s hard to stay friends for long in the technology industry, as Google is finding out. The Windows coalition has held through the turmoil, though Windows never branched far beyond PCs and computer servers to other devices. The PC is now a fringe of computing, and Windows isn’t even the heart of Microsoft anymore. It’s not clear how this all shakes out for Android and Google. In contrast to Windows, Android is moving far beyond the smartphone into powering thermostats, Web streaming gadgets hooked up to televisions and virtual reality headsets. But if the coalition can’t stay together, the big risk is Android turns out to be a crucial technology, but not an enduring one — the laser disc player of computing.  — (c) Bloomberg LP Share this article Tweet André Schild Excellent analysis! Skerminkel Android is simply becoming too big. It is a fantastic success and the fact that it is open source is probably the single greatest benefit to consumers. Unfortunately progress requires competition and a monopoly not very conducive to that. Andrew Fraser While there is little wrong with the facts presented in the article (except for using Siri on an android phone), I’m not convinced about the conclusions. Yes, Android is big and somewhat fragmented, but Android as such is not Google’s main business. Google is a service business, selling advertising primarily, and all products are designed to supplement that. The Pixel is not the first Google phone, there have been multiple generations of Nexus phones made by manufacturers like Motorola, Huawei, Asus, LG and, yes, even Samsung. And Google doesn’t even make the Pixel, it is manufactured by HTC. Arguing that, because Samsung is considering introducing a voice assistant, that the Android coalition is foundering is specious. Samsung has considered releasing devices without Android in the past using an OS called Tizen, but stopped that project because it couldn’t replace the huge number of services and applications available in the android stable. That hasn’t changed. While every handset manufacturer will try to differentiate their offering, that doesn’t mean that the Android alliance is dying. On the contrary, having multiple companies developing services on the core of Android is healthy for innovation. As Mark Twain may have said – the news of Android’s imminent demise are greatly exaggerated. André Schild Except for the sheer fact that Android doesn’t have just one, single “core” and is as fragmented as dark matter over the entire universe. There are thousands of versions running on even more devices, hence “somewhat fragmented” is quite the understatement 🙂 Andrew Fraser That’s true, but also a bit of a bogeyman argument. Yes there are multiple versions of Android in the wild but what of it? André Schild “Multiple”? Another big understatement 🙂 Fragmentation =-> losing control =-> negative impact on general product quality (security, UX, performance, version management, optimization, versatility etc etc.) Can’t make it any simpler than that 🙂 But that’s just my opinion… Kabelo Mpyatona I agree.

SiliconValley.com Twitter Facebook Google+ RSS   Social Web Mobile Cloud Gadgets Cleantech VC Data Games Policy Media   Google Search to provide federal, state election results By Ethan Baron / November 7, 2016 at 11:21 AM For what will no doubt be one of the most closely and anxiously watched elections in U.S. history, Google will integrate results into Search. Typing in “election results” will bring up state-by-state and national results — and updates — for president, the U.S. Senate, House and governors, plus state-level referendums and ballot propositions, according to Google. Data, sourced from the Associated Press, will become available via Search after polls close. Also of potential help to those bound for the ballot box are “where to vote” Google searches. Users can type in the address where they’re registered to vote, and Search will bring up their polling place, complete with a map.

MUST CREDIT: Washington Post photo by Sarah L. Voisin Sarah L. Voisin, The Washington Post .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... ..........WASHINGTON – Music artists are reacting with outrage at the dismissal of the head of the U.S. Copyright Office, calling the move an aggressive attack that is part of a larger effort to erode their creative rights and to bolster advocates of free content. “This is a major affront to copyright,” said songwriter and music publisher Dean Kay. “Google seems to be taking over the world – and politics … Their major position is to allow themselves to use copyright material without remuneration. If the Copyright Office head is towing the Google line, creators are going to get hurt.” The Copyright Office administers the complex set of rules governing copyright and advises Congress on policy and legal issues. It is a federal department within the Library of Congress. New Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden last month abruptly removed Maria Pallante from the position she held since 2011 and reassigned her to a role of “senior adviser.” In a letter to Pallante that was obtained by The Washington Post, Hayden listed Pallante’s new duties, including undertaking a review of the library’s retail operation. The job would require Pallante to file weekly reports to a deputy librarian, Hayden wrote; it would “not require any communications with Members of Congress.” Pallante was told to move out of her office, and people close to the situation in the library reported that she was locked out of her computer. Advertisement Continue reading Pallante resigned three days later. In a letter posted online, she requested the “reinstatement of access to my computer and email.” A library spokesman said she was not denied computer access. Singer Don Henley said Pallante’s ouster was “an enormous blow” to artists. “She was a champion of copyright and stood up for the creative community, which is one of the things that got her fired,” he said. Although personnel changes are not uncommon when a new leader comes in, many in the creative industries interpret Hayden’s move – made six weeks after she took office – as proof of her anti-copyright bias. They say Hayden’s library background aligns her with Google, which owns YouTube, the source of many claims of copyright infringement. “The librarian wants free content, and the copyright office is there to protect creators of content. They are diametrically opposed ideologies,” Henley said. Hayden, he added, “has a long track record of being an activist librarian who is anti-copyright and a librarian who worked at places funded by Google.” Hayden declined to be interviewed, although a spokesman referred to her April confirmation hearing, when she told a Senate committee that she would make sure the office functions “in a way that will protect the people it serves, and that is the creators of content.” Pallante did not return several messages and did not come to the door when a reporter knocked last week. Copyright regulations are more critical and more controversial than ever because of dramatic changes in technology. In one camp are tech and internet companies that seek exemptions to regulations in their efforts to spark innovation. On the other side are filmmakers, authors, musicians and television producers who want to limit free use and be paid for their creativity. Many of their representatives, including the Motion Picture Association of America, praised Pallante and advocated for a strong successor. “It is imperative that the next and future Registers have the expertise, support, resources, and independence to continue the Office’s essential and constitutionally-backed role of advancing the arts by rewarding creators for their work,” Joanna McIntosh, the MPAA’s executive vice president for global policy and external affairs, said in a statement. Pallante was considered an ally of the film, television, music and publishing industries, which contribute between $750 billion and $1 trillion in annual economic activity and employ more than 5 million people. Last year, she issued a report, “Copyright and the Music Marketplace,” that listed fair compensation to music creators as its first guiding principle. The report also opposed a change in music licensing supported by the Justice Department, noting that “Congress, not the DOJ,” has authority to change the system. She also advised Congress that a Federal Communications Commission proposal requiring cable providers to make their content accessible to third parties appeared to violate copyright regulations. Advertisement Continue reading Kay and Henley say technological changes are undercutting their livelihoods. “There’s a mind-set that the digital giants have fostered that everything on the Internet should be free,” Henley said. “When they say they want free and open access, that’s code for ‘We want free content.’ “ “You don’t make any money from recording music anymore,” he added. “The streaming services have wiped out that revenue stream.” A Google spokesman said the company had no contact with the Library of Congress or the administration about Pallante or the Copyright Office. Kay said he sees the losses personally and in his publishing business. “It’s all moving digital and streaming, and unless we can straighten things out and get copyright adhered to in terms of paying fairly, we’ll see great damage to all kind of creators,” he said. But advocates for broad digital access say that Pallante was too cozy with artists and that her focus on their rights came at the expenses of others, including the public. In a recent, sharply critical report that found systemic bias at the Copyright Office, Meredith Rose of the nonprofit group Public Knowledge concluded that the office had aligned itself with the entertainment industry and “regularly disregarded the concerns of … libraries, archives and the public at large.” Public Knowledge, which advocates for consumer rights, released the report in September, before Hayden was sworn in. “The Copyright Office advertises itself as a research entity, producing reports, but at the same time they very much act as a lobbying art for content producers,” Rose said. Advertisement Continue reading Julie Todaro, president of the American Library Association, dismissed the idea that Hayden’s library career makes her an automatic adversary to strong copyright enforcement. “People look at copyright as content providers versus users,” Todaro said. “Technology makes everybody both, so libraries represent and respect both. That’s why we buy $4 billion a year of copyrighted material. Libraries are not about making everything free.” Pallante’s removal is part of a larger reorganization at the Library of Congress that includes promotions of several key members of former librarian of Congress James H. Billington’s inner circle. Before retiring last year, Billington was sharply criticized by federal investigators who found widespread management failures with the library’s technology. At her Senate confirmation hearing, Hayden pledged to address those shortcomings, especially at the Copyright Office. Pallante publicly supported a congressional effort to overhaul the Copyright Office and to remove it from the Library of Congress, a position that probably contributed to her dismissal. But Hayden’s reassignment of a popular and well-respected leader could spark renewed interest in the effort to create an independent agency and thus undermine her attempt to control the office. Several lawmakers responded to Pallante’s departure with disappointment, and Sen. Orrin G. Hatch, R-Utah, said it “underscores the long-standing challenges” of housing the Copyright Office in the Library of Congress. “I look forward to exploring this relationship and considering possible legislative actions to ensure the viability of our copyright system,” Hatch said last month. That would be a silver lining to an otherwise disappointing development, Kay said. “If the person at the top of the Library of Congress is against copyright,” he said, “then being the manager of the Copyright Office is devastating.” copyright-office Share Tweet LinkedIn Email Print Subscribe More News Suggested Stories: Online pirates thrive on legitimate ad dollars – Jun 3, 2014 Stolen photos of stars find 'safe harbor' online – Sep 4, 2014 Appeals court sides with Google in anti-Muslim film case – May 18, 2015 Appeals court rules in favor of Google's online library – Oct 16, 2015 Advertisement Comments Subscribe to the Journal for only $12.

Gmail for iOS is finally on par with the Android version Engadget 11/7/2016 Nathan Ingraham © Provided by Engadget Google wants its services to be on as many devices as possible -- to meet that goal, the company has been putting out excellent versions of its apps on the iPhone for years now. That is, except for Gmail, arguably Google's best-known tool beyond search. The Gmail iOS app was essentially broken when it launched back in 2011. A big update in 2012 made things much better, but the app has only changed in fits and starts since then. Its design doesn't fit at all with Google's current standards and it can be very slow. It gets the job done, but there are absolutely better options for accessing Gmail on the iPhone, including Google's own Inbox app. Thankfully, Google has finally decided it's time to bring Gmail for iOS into the modern era. The new Gmail app for the iPhone and iPad rolling out today and it brings both design and functionality up to part with the Android app. Indeed, the app is basically indistinguishable with its Android counterpart now. The basic feature set is essentially unchanged -- you have access to all your Gmail labels and the excellent search feature. You can add multiple accounts, and the app reflects whatever Inbox style you've picked on the desktop (priority inbox, starred email first, the various tabs grouping social, promotional and update emails and so forth). Popular Searches Apple Inc AAPL ▼ 105.71 -2.72 -2.51% Samsung Electronics Co Ltd SSNLF ▼ 1,250.00 -175.00 -12.28% TransDigm Group Inc TDG ▼ 252.94 -19.35 -7.11% Amazon.com Inc AMZN ▼ 719.07 -19.94 -2.70% All of this worked in the old Gmail app. It was just much uglier if we're being honest. Now, the bright colors and animations of Material Design are present, emails have a small avatar showing you the sender, the sidebar lets you switch accounts faster -- the whole thing looks better and is more efficiently designed. The old Gmail also didn't perform like a native app. It reminded me of the old days of app, where many of them were simply a UI wrapper around content being pulled from the web. That made it feel like you were waiting much longer for emails to load than was reasonable in this day and age. That's all changed now -- there's no doubt that Gmail is much faster than it used to be. And there are a few new features to the app. They're not new if you've used Gmail anywhere else, but they're finally in the iOS app. First of all, the super-handy "undo send" feature is now available, saving your butt if you fire off an email to the entire company instead of just one person. You can also swipe a message to automatically archive or delete it, depending on your preference. As I mentioned, the whole app is faster, but search in particular got an overhaul. Now, you'll see search results auto-populate as you type, so you don't have to finish a word or hit enter to find the email you're looking for. Overall, the app feels like a cross between the old, traditional Gmail app and Inbox, which already had these new features. But if you aren't a fan of Inbox's grouping and snoozing features and just want the basic, plain-vanilla Gmail, this app absolutely does the trick. Google is also bringing a smaller update to the Calendar app for the iPhone today as well (sadly, the update doesn't include iPad compatibility). There's not much here, but Google did add one pretty useful feature: Events, reminders and goals that from your Google Calendar are now integrated into the iPhone's spotlight search. So if you're looking to make Google Calendar your main option over the built-in iPhone option, things should be a little easier. Google also added support for non-Gregorian calendars like Lunar, Islamic and Hindu -- so if you want to see those dates alongside the standard options, that's there. And if you want to quickly see a full week's view, just rotate your phone to landscape mode. Both the updated Gmail and Calendar apps should be rolling out to the App Store today. If you've been longing for a first-party Gmail app that feels up-to-date in 2016, definitely download today's update. It's been a long time coming, and after a few years using Inbox I might be ready to make the standard Gmail my main email app again. Here's hoping Google keeps updating it in a timely fashion rather than letting languish for years again.

What does this mean for you? Power – and lots of it. According to Qualcomm, the Snapdragon 821 is roughly twice as efficient and capable than the Snapdragon 810. Something new from @OnePlus is on the way…and it’s powered by our #Snapdragon 821 processor. Stay tuned. pic.twitter.com/3jOyZFRQ5tNovember 7, 2016 Next to the Snapdragon 820 chipset that you’ll commonly found in flagship phones like the Samsung Galaxy S7, LG V20 (and even the OnePlus 3), you’ll see smaller, but nevertheless noticeable benefits to performance and battery efficiency. The new chipset could also bring with it support for virtual reality by way of Google Daydream, if it comes stocked with Android Nougat, that is. The list of devices that support the new mobile VR platform is small: just the Google Pixel and Pixel XL. If true, it could be a huge selling point for the next OnePlus device. The rest of the equation OnePlus CEO Carl Pei has teased that the upcoming device will feature the beloved AMOLED display, and also keep the headphone jack that was omitted from the likes of the iPhone 7 and Moto Z. If OnePlus can do all of this and keep the price down on its next device, it could give the Google Pixel, and every other flagship smartphone in late 2016 and early 2017 for that matter, a good run for their money.
