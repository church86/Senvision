FILE PHOTO: A Google logo is seen in a store in Los Angeles, California, U.S., March 24, 2017.  The European Commission's decision will come after a seven-year investigation into the world's most popular internet search engine triggered by scores of complaints from both U.S. and European rivals. The EU competition authority accused Google in April 2015 of distorting internet search results to favour its shopping service, harming both rivals and consumers. The Commission and Google declined to comment. The U.S. company has in the past rejected the charges, saying that regulators ignored competition from online retailers Amazon (AMZN.O) and eBay Inc (EBAY.O). Fines for companies found guilty of breaching EU antitrust rules can reach 10 percent of their global turnover, which in Google's case could be about $9 billion of its 2016 turnover. Apart from the fine, the Commission will tell Google to stop its alleged anti-competitive practices but it is not clear what measures it will order the company to adopt to ensure that rivals get equal treatment in internet shopping results. The regulator could set out general principles or specific instructions for Google to follow, said an observer. The Commission's tough line is in sharp contrast with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission which settled its own web search case with the company in 2013 by requiring Google to stop "scraping" reviews and other data from rival websites for its own products. Google made three unsuccessful attempts to settle the case with the previous European Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia in a bid to stave off a possible fine and a finding of wrongdoing. Almunia's successor Margrethe Vestager, however, has shown no willingness to settle with Google. The company has also been charged with using its Android mobile operating system to squeeze out rivals and with blocking competitors in online search advertising related to its "AdSense for Search" platform. The platform allows Google to act as an intermediary for websites such as online retailers, telecoms operators or newspapers. The Commission has warned of massive fines in both cases.

This article tackles the three most popular platforms for online advertising, and whether they are worth it for small businesses to invest in. Find out everything you need to know about using paid ads to promote your small business. 1. Google paid ads Let’s start with the most obvious one, Google! According to Statista, “in November 2016, Google was ranked first amongst the most visited multi-platform web properties in the United States with 246 million U.S. unique visitors and a market share of 63.4% among the leading U.S. search engine providers.” Regarding Google’s paid advertising: · Google has tracked 4 billion store visits from ad clicks. · 39.6 percent of those Global Search Ad clicks come from desktops, and 48.9 percent comes from smartphones. · The clickthrough rate for mobile search ads on Google’s first place is 27.7 percent. Google offers two types of paid ads through Google AdWords, namely display ads and text ads. Display ads will appear while you are browsing on various websites and targeted through past searches. Text ads appear at the top or the side of every Google search page. These are ads that a company pays for so that people will notice their business whenever they’re searching Google. The company only has to pay whenever someone clicks on the ad, also known as pay-per-click advertising (PPC). Given the vast influence this search engine has, it is important to take time to consider whether Google AdWords can be beneficial to your small business. Challenges Investing in Google paid ads can bring about tremendous results, but unfortunately it does not work for everyone. It ultimately depends on your SEO value and type of business. The success of banner ads will vary based on your industry. For instance, if your audience is younger and more tech savvy, chances are they won’t click on a banner ad because they know it’s an ad. But, if you are promoting retirement services, your audience (i.e. the elderly population) will be more likely to click on them. Pay-per-click ads will have different degrees of success depending on which keywords you are trying to rank for. If you have a lot of competition and can’t invest a lot of money per click, you are going to get stuck on the Google’s 10th page. If you try to rank for niche keywords, you’ll be able to rank higher. At the early stages of Google’s paid advertising, it was a very effective strategy for small businesses. However, as AdWords has gotten more expensive it has become difficult for small companies to compete with mega brands. Interestingly, Google announced that they would be testing their local 3-pack to include one local ad and only two organic local results. This could be a game changer for small businesses interested in advertising on Google. Should you use Google’s paid ads? Overall, pursuing Google AdWords can be an expensive online advertising channel for small businesses. It all depends on your industry, as well as the budget you have for acquiring new customers. If you have decided to pursue this advertising strategy, check out Entrepreneur’s starter guide to setting up your Google AdWords campaigns. But if this is a little out of your league, Facebook and Instagram provide cheaper options for online advertising. 2. Facebook paid ads Facebook ads run on the same pay-per-click (or pay-per-impression) idea as Google’s ads. According to the Huffington Post , “thanks to amount of personal information in Facebook’s database, they allow you to get ridiculously detailed with your targeting. Anything a user can put into their profile -- age, sex, location, education, religion, interests, politics, job title, marital status, etc. -- can be used as a filter for your ads.” The best part is that Facebook Ads are surprisingly affordable! Here are some Facebook stats: · The platform has 1.71 billion monthly active users and 1.13 billion daily active users, on average. · Everyone on Facebook is connected to one another by an average of 3.57 degrees of separation. · Facebook takes up 22 percent of the internet time Americans spend on mobile devices, compared with 11 percent on Google search and YouTube combined. Challenges Facebook advertising usually fails for two reasons: either the business didn’t have a solid strategy in place, or they approached Facebook Ads with the wrong intentions. The most important thing to keep in mind is that Facebook Ads are passive, meaning they’re shown when the consumer isn’t necessarily in the buying mood. Direct selling on Facebook can, therefore, be tricky and its success depends on your product. According to Matthew Tyson , a marketing strategist, the most effective uses of Facebook Ads for small businesses are 1) increasing brand awareness and social exposure, and 2) capturing and nurturing leads. In terms of measuring your Facebook campaign, you should focus on Social ROI. More specifically, measure how engaged your audience is by looking at impressions, reach, likes, shares, click-through-rate and so on. You can analyze these metrics in real-time and adjust your Facebook ads along the way to increase their impact. Should you use Facebook’s paid ads? In conclusion, Facebook advertising is one of the most affordable and effective ways to market your business. In fact, 92 percent of social marketers use Facebook advertising. Just make sure you have a clear strategy in place, including realistic goals and objectives. 3. Instagram paid ads Since it launched 7 years ago, it has become clear that Instagram isn’t just for selfies and animal pictures. Instagram is one of the leading social media platforms for image-based content, with over 600 million active monthly users. But where this platform really shines is its level of user engagement: Engagement with brand on Instagram is 10 times higher than Facebook, 54 times higher than Pinterest and 84times higher than Twitter. What’s more: · This platform is nicknamed “the king of social media.” · Instagram accumulates 4.2 billion likes per day. · Instagram now has more than 1 million monthly advertisers, up five times from a year ago. In fact, the rise in marketers can be attributed in large part to Instagram’s focus on catering to small businesses, which make up the majority of Instagram’s advertisers, and its growing suite of free business tools. Besides providing all the important statistics, Instagram allows companies to observe how their unpaid posts perform organically before deciding which one is best to use for an ad campaign. Challenges Similar to Facebook, Instagram allows small and niche businesses to find new customers through their targeting abilities. For instance, you can use traits like gender, age groups and interests to target your ad campaign. However, small businesses need to take into account that this requires you to know your target audience and how to reach them. You need to be able to create images that elicit a response from that audience. Therefore, research is essential, as well as trial and error. It is also important to note that in order to create a Business Profile on Instagram, you need to be able to connect it to a Facebook Business Page. This is because Instagram works with Facebook to pull the audience information relevant to your ad campaign. So, you will have to set up these social media profiles before you get started. Should you use Instagram’s paid ads? Instagram is definitely worth investing in, especially as a small business. Even if you are not (actively) on Instagram yet, you can build a following with the help of their sponsored posts. However, if you do not have a clear grasp on who your target audience is, you will have to take a step back to pinpoint the most defining audience traits.

Home FEATURED Cellphones Notebooks Gaming Tablets Software Google Innovates Gboard Yet Again with More Card Carousels, Instant Share Features June 2, 2017, By Sanjeev Ramachandran Share This Related Posts Microsoft Extends Task-Management App Planner to Smartphone Platforms Nest’s Latest Security Camera Claims to be Smarter than an Average Camera The evolution of Google keyboard is certainly one among the best we have seen in the Android ecosystem so far. From being a keyboard that was instantly replaced with third-party keyboards by users who wanted more, the keyboard from Google has now become one of the most enjoyed keyboards in Android, thanks to its evolution into Gboard. All this achieved despite keeping the design layouts unchanged over the evolution, and Google is sticking with the same policy with their latest update: bringing massive overhauls without hampering the user friendly layout of the keyboard. The latest additions are now available in the beta version of Gboard, which adds a slew of new feature that can raise the popularity of Gboard even higher. Those include new search card carousels, share feature, GIF searches, new emoji search and more. The highlight is the addition of new search cards. Google will now pop up search cards for more search terms including locations instead of listing the search results vertically. Shortcuts will be provided alongside to perform quick actions like making a call or entering navigation. This will guide users to corresponding apps like Google Maps or Chrome. Another feature is the addition of a new explicit share button. Results from the keyboard appearing in cards can now be quickly shared in chats. While this feature is not a ground-breaking one, it still is indeed the one that will help users stick to their chats and conversations without having to work their fingers much for sharing locations or links. Google has also improved its media search by adding GIF lookup in web searches. Users will now be able to switch between web and GIF searches using the new tab along the bottom row of controls in the keyboard. Alongside, emojis can also be accessed in a new manner, i.e. by simply drawing them on a sketch pad that can be invoked with the help of a new button made available along the emoji search bar. The features are currently available in the beta version, but all of them can be expected to be present in the upcoming update for the stable app. Posted in: Software, Tech News Related Articles Microsoft Extends Task-Management App Planner to Smartphone Platforms Nest’s Latest Security Camera Claims to be Smarter than an Average Camera Note 8 to Reportedly Continue the Brilliance of Galaxy S8, but with Betterments Google is Letting You Go Personal Right from the Search Engine Gionee Gives S10 Some Boost with Dual-Cam Setup « Previous Post « Nest’s Latest Security Camera Claims to be Smarter than an Average Camera Next Post » Microsoft Extends Task-Management App Planner to Smartphone Platforms » Follow this blog Twitter Facebook RSS Tech Gaming Software Google Innovates Gboard Yet Again with More Card Carousels, Instant Share Features Nest’s Latest Security Camera Claims to be Smarter than an Average Camera Note 8 to Reportedly Continue the Brilliance of Galaxy S8, but with Betterments Google is Letting You Go Personal Right from the Search Engine Gionee Gives S10 Some Boost with Dual-Cam Setup Nintendo Wii U Wound Up, Switch is Here PlayStation VR Arrives this October as the Cheapest Console VR Sony’s PlayStation Now Services to Hop on to PS3 Consoles Next Week Xbox One April Update to Usher in Voice Message Feature Sony Rolls Out Web-based PlayStation Vue TV Services for PS Devices Microsoft Extends Task-Management App Planner to Smartphone Platforms Google Innovates Gboard Yet Again with More Card Carousels, Instant Share Features Telegram v4.0 Adds a Host of New Features; Video Messages and Payment via Chatbots Microsoft OneNote Embraces Design Overhaul to Ensure Consistency across All Platforms Google’s New Initiative is to Optimize Android for Low-End Devices DM on Facebook DM on Twitter Latest Tutorials Here’s How to Track Your Misplaced Smartphone with Alexa Here’s How to Add Self-Made Stickers in iMessage How to Enable Night Mode and Freeform Apps in Android N Create Personalized Emojis in Snapchat; Here’s How News Tips // Getting in Touch Have anything worth reading and writing about it, then why not send us an email to give us more details.

[Update: Site is live, more details] Google launches Funding Choices, a way for users to pay sites to hide ads Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/06/01 8:01pm PDTJun 1, 2017 35 Plus 1 on G+ 77 Share on Facebook 59 Share on Twitter Total Shares171 Games News Update 1: 2017/06/01 8:01pm PDT The new site for Google Contributor/Funding Choices is live, and offers some new insight into how the service actually works. According to the signup page, each page without ads You may recall Google Contributor, which was a service by Google that allowed users to pay a monthly contribution to see fewer ads online. Your money would directly substitute the money earned by the site for advertisements. Contributor was discontinued in late 2016, with Google saying that an improved version would become available in "early 2017." Today, the company launched Funding Choices, the successor to Contributor. Currently in beta, it allows sites to show a customized message to visitors using an ad blocker. The message asks users to either enable ads for the site, or pay for a pass through Contributor that removes all ads on that site. Unlike the original Contributor, Funding Choices hides more than just AdSense ads If you're reading this and thinking, "I really wish Android Police would do this," then you're in luck. We've been part of Google's internal beta, but we're not quite ready to roll it out. Just know that we are definitely working on it. The new Contributor site doesn't seem to be live yet, but there will likely be more details there soon. Source: Google Update 1: 2017/06/01 8:01pm PDT The new site for Google Contributor/Funding Choices is live, and offers some new insight into how the service actually works. According to the signup page, each page without ads that you view on a site costs a small amount, with publishers apparently able to change the price (most of them seem to use $0.01 per page right now). So assuming $0.01 per page, $1 gets you 100 pages without ads, and Google is offering a $5 pass to start out with. Not bad pricing at all, as long as sites stay around the $0.01 price point. Google also offers a list of sites supporting Google Contributor, which currently includes Beliefnet, Business Insider UK, ComicBook, Eurogamer, Grub Street, Hot Air, Parkers, Patheos, Popular Mechanics, Townhall, Twitchy, and World Wide Gaming.

NexusPhan The ads in AP are not bad. Very reasonable and not intrusive at all. I have this site whitelisted to help support their great work. You should consider it too before funding choices goes live. MJ There is certainly websites with much more obnoxious ads but their is a lot of ads on AP. It's just not an acceptable user experience and I not going to subject myself to it. I have been calling for a way to donate to AP for awhile now (why did AP have to wait for a Google solution?) so we see how this plays out. Alex Dueppen Unfortunately Disqus hasn't been the same way, it seems to often load ads that redirect you to those scam "You are winner" pages that try to look like facebook. Adriannacsmith Google is paying 97$ per hour! Work for few hours & have longer with friends and family! !dy164c: On tuesday I got a great new Land Rover Range Rover from having earned $8752 this last four weeks.. Its the most-financialy rewarding I've had.. Follow this link for more information !dy164c: ➽➽ ➽➽;➽➽ http://GoogleFinancialCashJobs454MarketDriveGetPaid$97/Hour... ★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫::::::!dy164c:....,..... NeverrKnowsBest I have gotten full screen malware ads from AP before. I did not want to block them, but they forced my hand. NexusPhan They did have a bad streak of ads for a while about a year ago. I remember that now that you say it. I enabled ad blocker for a few months after it happened. Corbin Davenport I will say that those are normally from Disqus, and we've worked with Disqus in the past to identify them and get them removed. ZettabyteGamer I'm sure it would be hard but if disqus is causing so many problems, maybe you should switch to a different comment section or make your own? Justin W I'd agree that AP's ads aren't bad, but Disqus's are terrible. Irwin LOL are you seriuos? on mobile, like half the site is all ads. It's ridiculous. blueman24 I'm ok with whitelist for sites like AP on desktop but on mobile, I don't want any ads. AP can add 5 more ads on their desktop site but don't cripple performance on my already slow phone. Rashad Would it be a one time cost or is this a cost each time we visit a participating site? Corbin Davenport I believe it's a monthly subscription, just like the previous Contributor. MJ Questions? Why did AP have to wait for a Google solution? There are many ways you could have been collecting money all this time. A automatic monthly subscription? Sounds like a loser already as people hate that. It's not going to be a set amount but like pick an amount right? An annual subscription would make more sense. Why can't there just be a simple donate button so people could send money when they can and just continuing blocking the ads ourselves like we have been already doing? Cai Copley It's that you do it in one, centralized location for such a subscription, and not doing it over a series of sites and forgetting how much you're spending. MJ I guess need more details on how it works... Jeff Beck We'll have a special rate for you MJ. .005 cents per article, $15 per grumpy comment submitted. We are going to make a fortune off you ;) George https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4ba5750c423a92daff44db461bb3042c433e0f5e7edc1f8dadcb32198db0d5e8.jpg Mark Curtis Or just block ads and not pay! I'm entitled to free content! gimme gimme gimme. faceless128 it's about safety. there are so many malicious advertisements out there. if a site doesn't directly control the ads that show up, how can they ensure our safety? Camerooni I use privacy badger.. if it blocks ads that play bad - I'm okay with that alongside blocking tracking cookies etc. What I don't like is sites assuming that if you're blocking an ad network that plays bad with you that you're the bad guy.. Things have to work both ways. Ailín Ó’S I wonder will this work internationally or just USA only because I use adblock and don't have AP (for example) whitelisted because of the sheer volume of ads on the site especially from the likes of Disqus with their "Congrats! You're a winner!" and "Local man makes 999.999€ a day with this trick!" spam. cadtek91 I'd imagine it would work with anyone with a Google account? Fabrice Thomas Seems like it's only available in these contries: US, Germany, New Zealand and UK https://support.google.com/contributor/answer/6182581?hl=en Jeff Beck If you want to just pay me directly I'll give you my PayPal address. That'll make things even easier on you. I know, I'm way too nice to you all, you're welcome. TechGuy22 Thanks but I'll stick adblock and adaway needa If you guys are wanting input, which I know you didn't ask for, five bucks a year would be my max. Not sure how it works, but I would want that on my mobile device. Desktop chrome has what I need in an extension. Ultimately that would earn more money from me, as i get on this sight far less with mobile chrome. Good_Ole_Pinocchio 5 bucks a year? What does that Pay for? Beer for the staff? needa If everyone that comes to this site with adblock paid five bucks, I doubt they would complain. Jeffrey Spiers Brave browser has this built into the browser directly, have used the feature on some of my most frequented sites. Switched to Brave due to many sites detecting and bitching about ad blockers recently. Good_Ole_Pinocchio Web Ads are trash, always. But I've never used ad blockers. Because if I'm taking the content, I'm taking the ads, or I just don't go to the site if the ads are really horrible. I'd more than pay for no ads. psy spy You have to sign in to your gmail account for this to work? Easier to track us. _jack_ It would be nicer to have this from another company, yes. I also wonder, how much Google keeps for themselves? Lord Argyris The official blurb is a little vague. Each time I visit a page without ads, my pass/account/whatever has the site's chosen cost deducted from it. What constitutes a "page"? If I refresh the tab, does that count as an additional page load? What if I visit an article again at a later date? What about those obnoxious sites that have an automatic reload timer? Could they game FC users? I'm sure all these questions will be answered in time. What I would have liked to have seen is some sort of a multiple tier system, whereby I can select specific participants (e.g AP) and offer to pay a flat monthly rate rather than a per-page fee, then leave the normal fee structure in place for others. It would be an easy way to donate more than I would ordinarily accumulate to places I come frequently, without forcing said sites to set up their own donation system. No matter what tier FC visitors choose, the site gets money. FelschR It's stated quite clearly: "Note: you are charged each time you visit or refresh a page, even if you have previously visited it." https://support.google.com/contributor/answer/7359560?hl=en&ref_topic=6182570 Matías Duarte I've only used AdBlock for AP the moment that those ads magically opened a new popup while scrolling without even touching them. Now that the annoying problem is gone, I've disabled it. I know no one cares about this but I finally got accepted for a job and I'll get my very first payment tomorrow, so I would happily pay a contribution for this page! Jeff Beck I'll be one to care. Congrats! Getting paid is awesome. At least that's what the other writers at AP tell me. ZettabyteGamer How long till I can use this with you guys? I'm itching to try it out, but this is the only site I really read everyday. Necdet Ali Özdür I think the real question here is what Google means by "fewer ads". Are all kinds of ads will be blocked or just intrusive ones? Will the trackers also be removed? someone755 Hmmm... https://youtu.be/4ezd24krgiQ Powsniffer0110 I'd be happy to pay 1¢ an article on AP and Phandroid, XDA ect.! Powsniffer0110 This is funny as hell lol. We're now paying Google to NOT give us ads... Haha.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 2 June 2017 by Maciej Heyman A guide to successfully investing in paid advertising Paid advertising can be a great way to guide more traffic to your site and increase business, however it can be an expensive endeavor if you don’t really know what you are doing. This article tackles the three most popular platforms for online advertising, and whether they are worth it for small businesses to invest in. Find out everything you need to know about using paid ads to promote your small business. 1. Google paid ads Let’s start with the most obvious one, Google! According to Statista, “in November 2016, Google was ranked first amongst the most visited multi-platform web properties in the United States with 246 million U.S. unique visitors and a market share of 63.4% among the leading U.S. search engine providers.” Regarding Google’s paid advertising: · Google has tracked 4 billion store visits from ad clicks. · 39.6 percent of those Global Search Ad clicks come from desktops, and 48.9 percent comes from smartphones. · The clickthrough rate for mobile search ads on Google’s first place is 27.7 percent. Google offers two types of paid ads through Google AdWords, namely display ads and text ads. Display ads will appear while you are browsing on various websites and targeted through past searches. Text ads appear at the top or the side of every Google search page. These are ads that a company pays for so that people will notice their business whenever they’re searching Google. The company only has to pay whenever someone clicks on the ad, also known as pay-per-click advertising (PPC). Given the vast influence this search engine has, it is important to take time to consider whether Google AdWords can be beneficial to your small business. Challenges Investing in Google paid ads can bring about tremendous results, but unfortunately it does not work for everyone. It ultimately depends on your SEO value and type of business. The success of banner ads will vary based on your industry. For instance, if your audience is younger and more tech savvy, chances are they won’t click on a banner ad because they know it’s an ad. But, if you are promoting retirement services, your audience (i.e. the elderly population) will be more likely to click on them. Pay-per-click ads will have different degrees of success depending on which keywords you are trying to rank for. If you have a lot of competition and can’t invest a lot of money per click, you are going to get stuck on the Google’s 10th page. If you try to rank for niche keywords, you’ll be able to rank higher. At the early stages of Google’s paid advertising, it was a very effective strategy for small businesses. However, as AdWords has gotten more expensive it has become difficult for small companies to compete with mega brands. Interestingly, Google announced that they would be testing their local 3-pack to include one local ad and only two organic local results. This could be a game changer for small businesses interested in advertising on Google. Should you use Google’s paid ads? Overall, pursuing Google AdWords can be an expensive online advertising channel for small businesses. It all depends on your industry, as well as the budget you have for acquiring new customers. If you have decided to pursue this advertising strategy, check out Entrepreneur’s starter guide to setting up your Google AdWords campaigns. But if this is a little out of your league, Facebook and Instagram provide cheaper options for online advertising. 2. Facebook paid ads Facebook ads run on the same pay-per-click (or pay-per-impression) idea as Google’s ads. According to the Huffington Post , “thanks to amount of personal information in Facebook’s database, they allow you to get ridiculously detailed with your targeting. Anything a user can put into their profile — age, sex, location, education, religion, interests, politics, job title, marital status, etc. — can be used as a filter for your ads.” The best part is that Facebook Ads are surprisingly affordable! Here are some Facebook stats: · The platform has 1.71 billion monthly active users and 1.13 billion daily active users, on average. · Everyone on Facebook is connected to one another by an average of 3.57 degrees of separation. · Facebook takes up 22 percent of the internet time Americans spend on mobile devices, compared with 11 percent on Google search and YouTube combined. Challenges Facebook advertising usually fails for two reasons: either the business didn’t have a solid strategy in place, or they approached Facebook Ads with the wrong intentions. The most important thing to keep in mind is that Facebook Ads are passive, meaning they’re shown when the consumer isn’t necessarily in the buying mood. Direct selling on Facebook can, therefore, be tricky and its success depends on your product. According to Matthew Tyson , a marketing strategist, the most effective uses of Facebook Ads for small businesses are 1) increasing brand awareness and social exposure, and 2) capturing and nurturing leads. In terms of measuring your Facebook campaign, you should focus on Social ROI. More specifically, measure how engaged your audience is by looking at impressions, reach, likes, shares, click-through-rate and so on. You can analyze these metrics in real-time and adjust your Facebook ads along the way to increase their impact. Should you use Facebook’s paid ads? In conclusion, Facebook advertising is one of the most affordable and effective ways to market your business. In fact, 92 percent of social marketers use Facebook advertising. Just make sure you have a clear strategy in place, including realistic goals and objectives. 3. Instagram paid ads Since it launched 7 years ago, it has become clear that Instagram isn’t just for selfies and animal pictures. Instagram is one of the leading social media platforms for image-based content, with over 600 million active monthly users. But where this platform really shines is its level of user engagement: Engagement with brand on Instagram is 10 times higher than Facebook, 54 times higher than Pinterest and 84times higher than Twitter. What’s more: · This platform is nicknamed “the king of social media.” · Instagram accumulates 4.2 billion likes per day. · Instagram now has more than 1 million monthly advertisers, up five times from a year ago. In fact, the rise in marketers can be attributed in large part to Instagram’s focus on catering to small businesses, which make up the majority of Instagram’s advertisers, and its growing suite of free business tools. Besides providing all the important statistics, Instagram allows companies to observe how their unpaid posts perform organically before deciding which one is best to use for an ad campaign. Challenges Similar to Facebook, Instagram allows small and niche businesses to find new customers through their targeting abilities. For instance, you can use traits like gender, age groups and interests to target your ad campaign. However, small businesses need to take into account that this requires you to know your target audience and how to reach them. You need to be able to create images that elicit a response from that audience. Therefore, research is essential, as well as trial and error. It is also important to note that in order to create a Business Profile on Instagram, you need to be able to connect it to a Facebook Business Page. This is because Instagram works with Facebook to pull the audience information relevant to your ad campaign. So, you will have to set up these social media profiles before you get started. Should you use Instagram’s paid ads? Instagram is definitely worth investing in, especially as a small business. Even if you are not (actively) on Instagram yet, you can build a following with the help of their sponsored posts. However, if you do not have a clear grasp on who your target audience is, you will have to take a step back to pinpoint the most defining audience traits.

Is this the future of travel? The Pal-V flying car; available from next year Credit: Pal-V Jonny Cooper 2 June 2017 • 6:00am Driverless cars, hypersonic underground tunnels, no more traffic lights… The Future Lab at the Goodwood Festival of Speed offers a glimpse of the shape of travel to come Regular visitors to the Goodwood Festival of Speed speak of a certain tang in the air. The annual four-day event sees a fleet of classic race cars and modern supermachines take it in turns to compete up the festival’s ‘Hillclimb’, a 1.16- mile track that winds its way through Lord March’s 11,500-acre estate. Intoxicating whiffs of throaty exhaust mingle with fresh, South Downs oxygen, creating a potion that’s joyfully inhaled by hundreds of thousands of spectators, who watch while soaking up the early summer sun. However, go down to Goodwood this year and you might be in for a surprise. In among all the combustion engines, there will be a collection of vehicles that call into question the future of mobility as we know it. Future Lab, an exhibition instigated by Lord March himself, promises to collate the big ideas that are jostling to shape the next generation of human travel, from driverless cars to hypersonic underground travel. The big players | Driverless cars It’s as though the ghosts of automobiles past and present are about to meet the spectre of what’s to come. What will the Goodwood air smell of in the future? ‘Driverless cars alone have the potential to completely change the way we travel,’ says Future Lab’s curator, Lucy Johnston. ‘And they’re closer than we think. In his most recent TED talk, Elon Musk (the entrepreneur who co-founded US carmaker Tesla) said that by the end of this year, an autonomous car will be able to leave a parking space in Los Angeles, navigate all the way across America, and park in a space in New York. If you promise that on the TED stage, you have to be pretty sure it’s going to happen.’ Indeed, driverless technology is a battleground for the world’s wealthiest companies, attracting eye-boggling investment from Silicon Valley and beyond. Name a big company and they’ve probably got a foot on the pedal: Uber and Volvo arguably lead the field, with a pilot scheme already running in Pittsburgh; Google has completed over two million miles of testing on public roads; Intel just sunk £12.5 billion into an autonomous-car tech company; Amazon is said to be looking at harnessing the cars for deliveries; and that’s before we’ve even mentioned the traditional car manufacturers – the BMWs and Audis, who all want a slice of the pie. Everyone went crazy when the Google car crashed into the bus, but if any human had driven that many miles, there would have been more accidentsJustin Cooke So it’s interesting that rather than use one of these big names to represent the future of driverless cars in her exhibition, Johnston has chosen the Robocar –  a madly futuristic, autonomous, electric car that was unveiled earlier this year by a British company of just 50 people. Robocar looks like a remote-controlled supercar that’s lost its top half: there’s no windscreen, no steering wheel, and nowhere for a human to sit. It can reach speeds of 200mph and is being tested on racetracks around the world – but spectators would be forgiven for struggling to identify Robocar as a car at all. And that, says Johnston, is part of the point. It forces spectators to appreciate the sheer capability of the technology. ‘When you first see Robocar, it spins you out  a bit. You realise the future is now real. We read a lot about driverless cars by companies such as Google, but they still look like cars. There’s a seat for a driver to take control, so your brain doesn’t have trouble joining the dots. With Robocar, your brain really does freak out – in a good way!’ The Robocar is seatless, driverless and can reach speeds of up to 200mph Credit: Benedict Redgrove    Johnston is confronting a problem that the driverless car industry knows only too well: that the computer technology for these vehicles is far ahead of our readiness to accept them into our lives. Elon Musk may be ready to send a car across America with no driver, but that doesn’t stop the idea sending a shiver down our collective spine. Which is why stories about driverless crashes, like the one between a Google car and a human-driven bus last year, travel so fast around the internet. We want to see the devil in computer-controlled cars, rather than the detail. ‘Everyone went crazy when the Google car crashed into the bus, but the reality is that it was the first crash after millions of miles of testing,’ says Justin Cooke, chief marketing officer of Kinetik, the company behind Robocar. ‘If any human had driven that many miles, there would have been more accidents.’ Other challenges include a game of chicken, where two Robocars speed towards a central line and have to stop as close to it as possible without hitting one another To help bridge this trust gap, Kinetik will next year launch Roborace, a competition designed to showcase its car’s capabilities, with teams of programmers striving to devise the most effective software and then running Robocar in front of spectators. In theory, Roborace will be to the driverless car what F1 is to the manual car: the supreme testing ground for technology that will ultimately trickle down to the consumer. Only in this instance, speed isn’t necessarily of the essence. ‘Roborace isn’t going to be your traditional race,’ explains Cooke. ‘Safety is top of the agenda for this technology, so we’re looking at setting tasks. Maybe the car has to reach 200kmh [125mph], then stop perfectly in a box.’ cars Goodwood 75MM gallery puff Other challenges being discussed include a game of chicken, where two Robocars speed towards a central line and have to stop as close to it as possible without hitting one another, and the introduction of robotic dogs on the racetrack – an idea borne from a testing session in February, when a real-life dog ran out on to the track and the Robocar swerved to avoid it. Roborace promises entertainment, but that’s not to say its real-world application is anything less than extraordinarily serious. With the hardware (the driverless cars themselves) already able to navigate city spaces and improving daily, an algorithm that can safely and efficiently control an entire car network has become the holy grail of autonomous transport. Find it, and the 97 per cent of accidents on our roads that are caused by human error disappear (Cooke says that, by comparison, a computer’s margin for error is ‘0.000something’). The HyperLoop ‘train’, funded by Tesla’s Elon Musk, proposes near-supersonic ‘tube’ travel  Credit: Hyperloop So too do traffic lights – instead, the computer can sort the most efficient flow of cars at any junction. No more sitting at red lights; no more slowing down as other drivers rubberneck a crash. The social implications are as startling. While some of us would regain the time we currently spend behind the wheel, others would lose their jobs. Estimates suggest there are around 400,000 HGV drivers in the UK alone; in the US, driving a vehicle is the most common job in 29 of the 50 states. All would face redundancy in the driverless epoch. We can also expect the face of our towns and cities to change significantly. The average car currently spends 95 per cent of its time parked in a drive or by the side of the road; that gets flipped on its head in a connected, autonomous system, where your next ride can be summoned at the touch of a button (much like Uber now, so you can see why it is keen to invest). How do Uber self driving / driverless cars work? ‘You’d only need main roads,’ says Cooke. ‘All those side streets running off B roads, where we currently park our cars, could be gardens for families. Kids could grow up in air that has more oxygen.’ Combine all this with advances in manufacturing techniques – 3D printing offers an alternative to the traditional production line – and Johnston thinks it’s no exaggeration to say that we could be looking at the next industrial revolution. However, she’s adamant that we shouldn’t be scared by the speed at which tech develops. ‘When people spell out the doom and gloom, that robots and AI are going to replace humans, I always say: “Yes, but it will also produce more roles in other places that don’t yet exist.” When Sir Tim Berners-Lee invented the web, we didn’t know that 20 years later one of the biggest industries in Britain would be digital design. We’re humans. We think creatively and we’re good at adapting.’ Italdesign and Airbus unveil Pop.Up  Credit: Airbus The obvious question that hangs over all this is: when? When will our trust of driverless cars catch up with their potential? Cooke suggests we could see an autonomous network within the next five years. Design company Italdesign, at Goodwood to show off its concept of detachable travel pods that use engines on the ground and propellers to fly through the air, says the radical vision could become reality within 10 years. Embrace the technology and it seems the possibilities become endless. But are we really so close to taking the handbrake off the future of travel? Transport entrepreneur Robert Dingemanse is sceptical. ‘Some of the concepts we see in transport were there in the 1930s. Of course, we’ve improved the concept since then, but making something safe and accepted by regulators is another thing.’ He cites the example of two relatively minor regulation changes for three-wheeled vehicles in Europe, which were first discussed in 2002, agreed in 2011, and are yet to be fully implemented. ‘These things move in decades, not years.’ Tech trends | An acceleration in driverless cars Dingemanse’s own project is Pal-V, a flying car that can reach 112mph on the ground and in the air, and will be commercially available next year (pre-orders start around £260,000, in case you’re wondering). It’s one of a handful of exhibits at Future Lab that look to use the ‘Third Dimension’ of travel – away from flat, congested roads and up into the air or down into the ground, where space isn’t at a premium. Pal-V is perhaps the most easy to understand: a small gyro plane-cum-car that will offer rural communities and the super-wealthy an efficient way to travel from door-to-door. At the loopier end is HyperLoop, a Musk-funded project that’s trying to shoot capsules of people through tunnels at near-supersonic speeds. If that one takes off, we’re looking at London to Manchester in 18 minutes flat. Does all this mean that the humble car as we know it is dead? Is that tang in the air above Goodwood soon to be a thing of the past? ‘Not at all,’ asserts Dingemanse. ‘We’re still driving cars that are 100 years old and it will be the same in 100 years’ time. Autonomous cars and flying cars and tunnels will offer different modalities, but people will still want to drive themselves. Humans like to determine their own destiny. That’s freedom.’  The Goodwood Festival of Speed runs from  29 June-2 July 2017   Share this article Follow Telegraph Science & Tech Follow on Facebook Follow on Twitter Follow on Instagram Follow on Pinterest View comments If you would like to add a comment, please register or log in Register Log in Please review our commenting policy Follow Telegraph Science & Tech Follow on Facebook Follow on Twitter Follow on Instagram Follow on Pinterest Related Topics Tesla Humans Driverless cars Amazon Flying cars Robotics Artificial Intelligence Luxury motoring BMW Elon Musk 3D Printing Space Goodwood Festival of Speed Volvo Roads Audi Google Race Uber Goodwood Fast cars Internet Motoring Show more Technology latest 02 Jun 2017, 7:00am Snapchat Spectacles go on sale in the UK: Where to buy them and how they work 02 Jun 2017, 7:01am Google Doodle celebrates ICC Champions Trophy with addictive cricket game - what you need to know about tournament 01 Jun 2017, 9:04pm Facebook shareholders reject fake news proposal 01 Jun 2017, 5:31pm BT to show Champions League final clips on Snapchat 01 Jun 2017, 4:46pm Uber 'on path to profitability' as losses fall to $708m 00:41 01 Jun 2017, 4:07pm Japan launches rocket in first phase of new GPS 01 Jun 2017, 3:22pm WWDC 2017: iOS 11 best features and release date, plus everything we know about Apple's new software 01 Jun 2017, 1:31pm Amazon Prime Day 2017: When is it and what are the best deals? 01 Jun 2017, 12:42pm Why does Google Street View’s 'Pegman' have a party hat and balloons? 01 Jun 2017, 12:13pm When is WWDC 2017 and what will Tim Cook and Apple announce? 01 Jun 2017, 11:18am First robotic cop joins Dubai police Gallery 01 Jun 2017, 10:01am Gallery: Stratolaunch: Microsoft founder unveils world's largest plane, in pictures 00:46 01 Jun 2017, 10:00am World’s biggest aeroplane revealed: Immense aircraft boasts six engines and is wider than a football pitch Gallery 01 Jun 2017, 8:30am Gallery: Obsolete technologies that will baffle modern children - in pictures  01 Jun 2017, 8:27am Elon Musk to quit Donald Trump's advisory councils if US leaves Paris agreement 01 Jun 2017, 6:55am Comment: The polls might be unreliable now, but voting will soon be as predictable as your Amazon shopping basket Juliet Samuel Premium 01 Jun 2017, 4:21am Hillary Clinton says Facebook 'must prevent fake news from creating a new reality' 01 Jun 2017, 12:01am Data watchdog fines double the number of businesses for breaches in crackdown  01 Jun 2017, 12:01am Deliveroo offers workers pay per trip in bid to defuse self employment row  31 May 2017, 6:13pm When is the Microsoft E3 2017 Xbox press conference and what can we expect from Project Scorpio? 00:57 31 May 2017, 5:52pm Zaha Hadid: Who was she and what were her most impressive buildings?  Contact us Rewards Archive Reader Prints Branded Content Syndication Guidelines Privacy Terms and Conditions Leave your feedback © Telegraph Media Group Limited 2017 We've noticed you're adblocking.

Apple is expected to extend its Siri voice-activated helper beyond the iPhone to a sleek new speaker. Credit: Apple Most Popular Agencies and brands suddenly have plenty of questions for Siri, which Apple is expected to extend from the iPhone to a new home-assistant device at its conference for developers next week. Marketers and publishers are eager to see where they could fit into the device, but right now all they know is the world of Amazon and Google's assistants, where they've accumulated plenty of experience developing programs to answer consumers' commands. Apple is late to the party. It also traditionally maintains tighter control over its ecosystem than its rivals. "Amazon and Google have allowed broad third-party support, but brands may want to temper their expectations for any Siri additions," said Jon Reiling, AKQA's head of emerging technology for Atlanta and Washington, D.C., in an e-mail. "If their previous implementation of third-party Siri integration is anything to go by, Apple's concern for multilingual support, privacy and user experience means that they will remain gatekeepers for many elements of the user interaction." So far, brands have taken most to Amazon, because its Alexa controls 70% of the voice-enabled speaker market in the U.S., according to eMarketer. Alexa can take voice commands to order a Lyft, send a text message through AT&T, reserve a table through OpenTable and play videos from Amazon's library. Brands have the potential to score big when they become the go-to habit in a voice-assisted service. "We've built prototypes for brands on Alexa and are working on one for Google Assistant," Azher Ahmed, exec VP-director of digital at DDB Worldwide, said in an e-mail. The agency's emphasis is on services that naturally make sense for the way people use assistants and offer some kind of value, he said, as opposed to gimmicks designed just to force a brand's way onto a cool new platform. Ahmed declined to identify the brands for which DDB is developing home-assistant apps. Related Stories Google Will Promote Its AI Assistant Home in a Super Bowl Spot Steve Smith Gets an Assist From Alexa in Amazon Echo's New Spot Apple's Siri speaker will likely feature the "usual spit and polish" one expects from the hardware maker, Reiling said. Reports have indicated that the speaker will offer sound quality above Amazon and Google's devices. Still, Siri does not have a reputation as the smartest smart assistant, and both Google and Amazon have superior machine learning technology. "Siri must differentiate in broad ways, beyond hardware," Reiling said. "The assistant is too quick to frustrate and too easy of a punchline." Third-party developers could be the key to Apple's home-controlling devices, and it will look to dominate like it has with its app store, which has been the most innovative and lucrative. On Thursday, Apple said the App Store generated $70 billion for third-party developers since it first opened. There will be room for that base of developers to build for Siri in the home. "If Apple releases this platform in the same way they released their watch and the iMessage platform, a native app developer will be able to simply build an extension for their app," Christian Brucculeri, CEO of Snaps, an Apple iPhone developer, said in an e-mail. "This would make sense as it'll allow Apple to leverage its massive installed app base to populate its speaker with experiences with the least amount of friction for consumers and developers." But Apple often prefers its own services for music and other forms of media. That could make it hard, if not impossible, for Spotify and others to integrate with Siri in the home. Apple, of course, has Apple Music. In this article: A.I.

Gboard v6.3 enables search suggestions in the Google app and widget for some Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/06/01 9:32am PDTJun 1, 2017 36 Plus 1 on G+ 60 Share on Facebook 41 Share on Twitter Total Shares137 Applications News Google dropped a new version of Gboard last night, which includes a number of cool improvements to search. Some people are reporting another interesting feature in the form of Google search suggestions int he Google app and widget. Not everyone seems to have this, though. On older versions of Gboard, the keyboard's suggestion bar disappears when doing a search. That's still what it looks like for myself and most other AP staff after the update to v6.3. However, we've heard from a not insignificant number of people who are seeing the suggestion bar. This appears when searching via the Google widget and within the Google app. It seems to work just like the suggestion bar elsewhere. Start typing, and the keyboard guesses what word you might want to use next based on your typing history and the power of Google's prediction engine. Just grab the new version of Gboard and open a search to see if you've got it. Download QR-Code Gboard - the Google Keyboard Developer: Google Inc.

Also had a nice little dog paw on my spacebar, until a separate update this morning removed it. Artem Russakovskii Yes https://plus.google.com/+ArtemRussakovskii/posts/aYxevnQNXK7 https://plus.google.com/+ArtemRussakovskii/posts/BsXuhKZQbmz F4LL0U7 I got that too, briefly. I think they accidentally pushed out the dogfood version. mike shwilly Somehow the suggestions/corrections bar doesn't even appear for me on menus like that. Anyone got a clue? https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/fcf5ae1af260f403d6fe67b4a16960601a0f678f624415845c966be49de6c152.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/7db6affa5d2544f41d448de7188c46494be0ca138cb1088830fd557174531b65.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/0729dbe9f8f2b6951428091c0dc20c66822aa0bd1fb3d8c8198fba4181bd896a.png Artem Russakovskii That's the mystery - I'm not seeing suggestions either, but many are. mike shwilly I think i had this problem since Nexus 5. It has always been really annoying. Suicide_Note Deftones are a terrible band. Hurricane Andrew I still do not see it on my S7 Edge. I wonder if launcher choice makes a difference. I use Action Launcher. Would be interesting to know what launcher people who are and are not seeing this are using. Yuri Vidal on my s7 it works. are you a beta tester? i also dont use touchwiz launcher. the suggestion bar works for me on chrome, and on google app too. jkl888 I see the suggestions on my phone Artem Russakovskii I'm on the Pixel Launcher, tried both Google app 7.2 and 7.3, and Gboard 6.2 and 6.3, and I don't have this. Reply and post your launcher, Google App version, and Gboard version, and whether you have suggestions or not. Armando Rodriguez Have you notice that the "short" height is shorter than previous versions? abqnm Are you on an S8 or G6? They tweaked some proportions on the odd aspect ratio devices. The S8 doesn't have the hugely tall spacebar anymore, which may be why it seems that way. If you're not on one of those I'm not sure as it seems the same to me. Armando Rodriguez Nexus 5 DPI at 420 Raz Have it. Nova Beta, GBoard 6.3.15.157483061-arm64-v8a, Google app 7.3.19.21.arm64. The new GBoard just asked for access to my SMS to improve the suggestions. Bruno Logerfo wait since when there's a dark theme for the google widget? João Ricardo He problaby has a theme kervation I am using a Google Pixel XL with the stock pixel launcher, running Google app version 7.3.19.21 & Google Gboard version 6.3.15.157483061. I have the suggestion bar for the Google app and also the Chrome beta browser and regular Chrome browser. I also have search suggestions show up when typing in the Google app. JATIN BANSAL I think this is also new. Earlier in dark themes, they used to have a white glow around emoji but now it is gone. I like it now https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/c8bcc901c9f60b97c05dc467df6fa4838f96cabcfbf6421714f5ec7189958205.png roberto.elena I wished the keyboard had a dynamic theme that would change automatically based on the app being used, like the status bar does: Youtube = red, WhatsApp = green, Facebook = blue, etc. thegrau There's a third party keyboard that does exactly that. Can't remember the name, but I believe it's based on AOSP Yuri Vidal chroma keyboard Łukasz Ordon There is also Xposed module that can do that... I used to use it but the framework is not available for 7.0+ yet... Adriannacsmith Google is paying 97$ per hour!

Lexster Okay, but...when will they put a freaking space after punctuation? It's not that difficult, but after using Swiftkey, I really can't get used to having to put a space after punctuation. catalysto I would NOT want that. Don't need my OCD flaring up with unnecessary spaces. Though, sure, it should probably be an option. Lexster How are spaces after periods of sentences unnecessary? hype67 In acronyms, when the dot doesn't denote the end of a sentence. As decimals. Others situations I can't remember off the top of my head. Lexster USe acronyms with periods a lot, do you? I can't remember the last time I did. It's not generally required for acronyms. You put FBI, not F. B. I. But, yes, it's a little annoying with decimals, but that can generally be programmed to recognize if the space isn't needed. Swiftkey often does. It misses sometimes, sure, but usually works well. If a field needs an IP address, it usually knows this and doesn't put a space. And yes, it can be annoying with website names, but it's much easier to backspace every once in awhile than have to hit space after every single period or question mark. Łukasz Ordon Just press space twice :P It puts full stop AND a space after it... Lexster Yes, but I prefer having the space after punctuation. Doesn't require two taps of the space bar. And it only enters periods. Łukasz Ordon Oh well... You can't make everyone happy... Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Typing URLs and email addresses is a giant pain in SwiftKey. catalysto When it's the last sentence. Lexster Okay? Well, it doesn't add a space until you type a letter, so if it's the last sentence, there wouldn't be a space unless you typed something else. catalysto A period does not always signify the end of a sentence though. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman So glad it doesn't do that. One of the worst things in SwiftKey. Typing URLs and email addresses was such a giant pain in the ass. Hitting space after I type a period isn't a big deal to me AT ALL. Especially since I'm used to typing on a keyboard anyway, so do it automatically. ozzyager I do see suggestions when doing a search. I also recieved the dog bone version first, before being updated again shortly thereafter. Maybe just a coincidence? catalysto Same thing happened to me. It's still working after updating to the non-beta version, too. Though I'm in the beta program for Gboard, so maybe that has something to do with it? My version number is 6.3.15.157483061-arm64-v8a, in case anyone is curious. Łukasz Ordon That Gboard app version with dog paw should not be released publicly. It indicates 'dogfood' version (as googlers call it) which should be tested only inside Google. Dogfood is just debug version of normal app (don't quote me on that tho) ozzyager Correct. This is why I wondered if there was any connection between that version being released by accident to some, like myself, and only some seeing the suggestions when doing a search. Of course it might just be a server side update that is being tested, etc. Łukasz Ordon I've myself got dogfood version but shortly after (like 5 mins later) I've received another update with normal apk... Armv7 version btw :p roberto.elena It also gives suggestions in Chrome while in incognito mode. abqnm While that may be unwanted, it should be pointed out that it now gives suggestions in the Chrome address bar. Period. Previously it did not suggest anything at all in the Chrome address bar, incognito or no. I still don't have it in search though. It does work when typing to Assistant, but it may have done that previously. boop Can someone explain the nav bar in the second pic? Łukasz Ordon It's probably Pixel phone navbar... destinyhud pixel phone if u mean the down arrow then when u click a bar the left become a down arrow boop The color, I mean Hurricane Andrew Running Action Launcher 3, Google app version 7.3.19.21, Gboard version 6.3.15.157483061 and do not have the suggestions in the search app. Łukasz Ordon Talking about Google app itself... apparently, cards in Google Now feed have new design now https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/5fbd4b5888c4ad6d684f6ab3ba7589a3354607b05f565c0b7aed404237d8d8dc.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/ed878edc7fa830f93bf49db1a7d5c8b4267ae6cada762eb9d0e723312cd72c5a.png Łukasz Ordon Aaaaand it's gone...

Teja The word prediction is the only thing I worry about. Swiftkey is way better than Gboard which made me to switch back to Swiftkey. Michael Oghia Does anyone else experience problems with the spell check feature? Sometimes I misspell a word, it tells me it's misspelled, but then doesn't offer any suggestions. It used to work better a few years ago (when it was still just keyboard or whatever it was called). Vratislav Jindra I would swear I had this yesterday. Today it disappeared.

[Update: Site is live, more details] Google launches Funding Choices, a way for users to pay sites to hide ads Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/06/01 8:01pm PDTJun 1, 2017 35 Plus 1 on G+ 77 Share on Facebook 59 Share on Twitter Total Shares171 Games News Update 1: 2017/06/01 8:01pm PDT The new site for Google Contributor/Funding Choices is live, and offers some new insight into how the service actually works. According to the signup page, each page without ads You may recall Google Contributor, which was a service by Google that allowed users to pay a monthly contribution to see fewer ads online. Your money would directly substitute the money earned by the site for advertisements. Contributor was discontinued in late 2016, with Google saying that an improved version would become available in "early 2017." Today, the company launched Funding Choices, the successor to Contributor. Currently in beta, it allows sites to show a customized message to visitors using an ad blocker. The message asks users to either enable ads for the site, or pay for a pass through Contributor that removes all ads on that site. Unlike the original Contributor, Funding Choices hides more than just AdSense ads If you're reading this and thinking, "I really wish Android Police would do this," then you're in luck. We've been part of Google's internal beta, but we're not quite ready to roll it out. Just know that we are definitely working on it. The new Contributor site doesn't seem to be live yet, but there will likely be more details there soon. Source: Google Update 1: 2017/06/01 8:01pm PDT The new site for Google Contributor/Funding Choices is live, and offers some new insight into how the service actually works. According to the signup page, each page without ads that you view on a site costs a small amount, with publishers apparently able to change the price (most of them seem to use $0.01 per page right now). So assuming $0.01 per page, $1 gets you 100 pages without ads, and Google is offering a $5 pass to start out with. Not bad pricing at all, as long as sites stay around the $0.01 price point. Google also offers a list of sites supporting Google Contributor, which currently includes Beliefnet, Business Insider UK, ComicBook, Eurogamer, Grub Street, Hot Air, Parkers, Patheos, Popular Mechanics, Townhall, Twitchy, and World Wide Gaming.

NexusPhan The ads in AP are not bad. Very reasonable and not intrusive at all. I have this site whitelisted to help support their great work. You should consider it too before funding choices goes live. MJ There is certainly websites with much more obnoxious ads but their is a lot of ads on AP. It's just not an acceptable user experience and I not going to subject myself to it. I have been calling for a way to donate to AP for awhile now (why did AP have to wait for a Google solution?) so we see how this plays out. Alex Dueppen Unfortunately Disqus hasn't been the same way, it seems to often load ads that redirect you to those scam "You are winner" pages that try to look like facebook. Adriannacsmith Google is paying 97$ per hour! Work for few hours & have longer with friends and family! !dy164c: On tuesday I got a great new Land Rover Range Rover from having earned $8752 this last four weeks.. Its the most-financialy rewarding I've had.. Follow this link for more information !dy164c: ➽➽ ➽➽;➽➽ http://GoogleFinancialCashJobs454MarketDriveGetPaid$97/Hour... ★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫::::::!dy164c:....,..... NeverrKnowsBest I have gotten full screen malware ads from AP before. I did not want to block them, but they forced my hand. NexusPhan They did have a bad streak of ads for a while about a year ago. I remember that now that you say it. I enabled ad blocker for a few months after it happened. Corbin Davenport I will say that those are normally from Disqus, and we've worked with Disqus in the past to identify them and get them removed. ZettabyteGamer I'm sure it would be hard but if disqus is causing so many problems, maybe you should switch to a different comment section or make your own? Justin W I'd agree that AP's ads aren't bad, but Disqus's are terrible. Irwin LOL are you seriuos? on mobile, like half the site is all ads. It's ridiculous. blueman24 I'm ok with whitelist for sites like AP on desktop but on mobile, I don't want any ads. AP can add 5 more ads on their desktop site but don't cripple performance on my already slow phone. Rashad Would it be a one time cost or is this a cost each time we visit a participating site? Corbin Davenport I believe it's a monthly subscription, just like the previous Contributor. MJ Questions? Why did AP have to wait for a Google solution? There are many ways you could have been collecting money all this time. A automatic monthly subscription? Sounds like a loser already as people hate that. It's not going to be a set amount but like pick an amount right? An annual subscription would make more sense. Why can't there just be a simple donate button so people could send money when they can and just continuing blocking the ads ourselves like we have been already doing? Cai Copley It's that you do it in one, centralized location for such a subscription, and not doing it over a series of sites and forgetting how much you're spending. MJ I guess need more details on how it works... Jeff Beck We'll have a special rate for you MJ. .005 cents per article, $15 per grumpy comment submitted. We are going to make a fortune off you ;) George https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4ba5750c423a92daff44db461bb3042c433e0f5e7edc1f8dadcb32198db0d5e8.jpg Mark Curtis Or just block ads and not pay! I'm entitled to free content! gimme gimme gimme. faceless128 it's about safety. there are so many malicious advertisements out there. if a site doesn't directly control the ads that show up, how can they ensure our safety? Camerooni I use privacy badger.. if it blocks ads that play bad - I'm okay with that alongside blocking tracking cookies etc. What I don't like is sites assuming that if you're blocking an ad network that plays bad with you that you're the bad guy.. Things have to work both ways. Ailín Ó’S I wonder will this work internationally or just USA only because I use adblock and don't have AP (for example) whitelisted because of the sheer volume of ads on the site especially from the likes of Disqus with their "Congrats! You're a winner!" and "Local man makes 999.999€ a day with this trick!" spam. cadtek91 I'd imagine it would work with anyone with a Google account? Fabrice Thomas Seems like it's only available in these contries: US, Germany, New Zealand and UK https://support.google.com/contributor/answer/6182581?hl=en Jeff Beck If you want to just pay me directly I'll give you my PayPal address. That'll make things even easier on you. I know, I'm way too nice to you all, you're welcome. TechGuy22 Thanks but I'll stick adblock and adaway needa If you guys are wanting input, which I know you didn't ask for, five bucks a year would be my max. Not sure how it works, but I would want that on my mobile device. Desktop chrome has what I need in an extension. Ultimately that would earn more money from me, as i get on this sight far less with mobile chrome. Good_Ole_Pinocchio 5 bucks a year? What does that Pay for? Beer for the staff? needa If everyone that comes to this site with adblock paid five bucks, I doubt they would complain. Jeffrey Spiers Brave browser has this built into the browser directly, have used the feature on some of my most frequented sites. Switched to Brave due to many sites detecting and bitching about ad blockers recently. Good_Ole_Pinocchio Web Ads are trash, always. But I've never used ad blockers. Because if I'm taking the content, I'm taking the ads, or I just don't go to the site if the ads are really horrible. I'd more than pay for no ads. psy spy You have to sign in to your gmail account for this to work? Easier to track us. _jack_ It would be nicer to have this from another company, yes. I also wonder, how much Google keeps for themselves? Lord Argyris The official blurb is a little vague. Each time I visit a page without ads, my pass/account/whatever has the site's chosen cost deducted from it. What constitutes a "page"? If I refresh the tab, does that count as an additional page load? What if I visit an article again at a later date? What about those obnoxious sites that have an automatic reload timer? Could they game FC users? I'm sure all these questions will be answered in time. What I would have liked to have seen is some sort of a multiple tier system, whereby I can select specific participants (e.g AP) and offer to pay a flat monthly rate rather than a per-page fee, then leave the normal fee structure in place for others. It would be an easy way to donate more than I would ordinarily accumulate to places I come frequently, without forcing said sites to set up their own donation system. No matter what tier FC visitors choose, the site gets money. FelschR It's stated quite clearly: "Note: you are charged each time you visit or refresh a page, even if you have previously visited it." https://support.google.com/contributor/answer/7359560?hl=en&ref_topic=6182570 Matías Duarte I've only used AdBlock for AP the moment that those ads magically opened a new popup while scrolling without even touching them. Now that the annoying problem is gone, I've disabled it. I know no one cares about this but I finally got accepted for a job and I'll get my very first payment tomorrow, so I would happily pay a contribution for this page! Jeff Beck I'll be one to care. Congrats! Getting paid is awesome. At least that's what the other writers at AP tell me. ZettabyteGamer How long till I can use this with you guys? I'm itching to try it out, but this is the only site I really read everyday. Necdet Ali Özdür I think the real question here is what Google means by "fewer ads". Are all kinds of ads will be blocked or just intrusive ones? Will the trackers also be removed? someone755 Hmmm... https://youtu.be/4ezd24krgiQ Powsniffer0110 I'd be happy to pay 1¢ an article on AP and Phandroid, XDA ect.! Powsniffer0110 This is funny as hell lol. We're now paying Google to NOT give us ads... Haha.

Reviews / Samsung Galaxy S8 review: a great phone, but not Galaxy S7 great By Hadlee Simons on 1 June, 2017 How do you build on the success of the Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge (review)? It’s quite possibly one of the best smartphones ever released, combining a killer camera with a respectable battery and a gorgeous screen. That alone is a tall order, but throw in the Note 7 disaster and you’ve got all eyes on Samsung, as it seeks to regain its place atop the Android smartphone pile. Speaking of “tall”, that’s the first thing you’ll notice about the Galaxy S8… Design Imagine the Galaxy S7 Edge, but with thinner bezels, a similarly thin design and a taller form factor, and you’ve got a great idea of what the Galaxy S8 is like. Much like LG and the G6 (review), Samsung has opted for the high screen/body ratio, cutting borders away to just a sliver at the top and bottom. But Samsung has thrown in that dual-curved screen as well, dominating the front of the phone. And the only logo you’ll find is on the back. LG’s smartphone is definitely thicker, with Samsung’s device being more svelte. I quite like LG’s heft and thicker design though — I don’t feel like the S8 can survive an accidental drop. In fact, a fellow tech writer friend has already cracked their review unit after an inadvertent drop. As for materials, you’re looking at a metallic rim (tapering off on the left and right edges) and a glass back that attracts fingerprint grease. In any event, it all comes together to produce a phone that definitely feels expensive. In terms of I/O and buttons, you’ve got an earphone jack (yay), USB Type-C port and speaker at the bottom, power/lock button on the left, SIM/microSD bay at the top, and volume rocker and Bixby button on the left. More on that Bixby button later… Between the high screen/body ratio, the materials used and the thin form factor, the Galaxy S8 definitely makes for a striking first impression. Is it the most visually appealing Android smartphone around? I still like the Mi Mix, but Samsung’s device is certainly in the running. Display Whether you’re a member of the LCD legion or an AMOLED acolyte, I think we can all agree that the Galaxy S8 has an absolutely gorgeous screen. Text looks sharp, your photos look great and the choice to go narrow and tall, much like the G6, is a wise one. It’s not a fingerprint magnet like many other screens, while it bursts with colour and reaches some high brightness levels. You won’t have trouble in direct sunlight, then. And the AMOLED nature of the screen means that always-on functionality (displaying the clock, battery life, etc) is put to good use, only lighting a portion of the screen rather than the whole display. The display is HDR-enabled, but Netflix only supports the LG G6 as of writing, while other services like Amazon Prime Video and YouTube are missing. The ability to record video in HDR would be a solid way improve the content situation then, but it’s not present either. Nevertheless, the 18.5:9 screen ratio and tall, narrow screen is indeed a great decision. The phone’s display does feel a little too tall when reaching for the dropdown menu and the upper sixth of the screen, necessitating a shuffle to get to the top with one hand. But overall, it’s reminiscent of the iPhone 5, feeling far more ergonomic than a traditional 5.7-inch display even. Heck, my seeded Huawei P9 feels super wide in comparison, despite having a 5.2-inch screen. I’m still not fully sold on the dual-curved design though, as gorgeous as it is. The hit-and-miss palm rejection tech means you might miss camera shots on the very odd occasion or accidentally open a WhatsApp contact’s profile photo (this happened far too often for my liking). Still, if you’re basing your purchase on display quality above all else, the Galaxy S8 is definitely up there with the Xperia XZ Premium as one of the best in the market. Performance on paper? Last year’s Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge stood out for sheer horsepower too, with the Exynos 8890 chipset actually beating the Snapdragon 820 used in rival phones. In fact, the Samsung chip was also more powerful than Huawei’s own beefy Kirin 950 chip, specifically in the graphics department. Does the Galaxy S8 and its Exynos 8895 provide a big leap though? An Antutu test saw the phone deliver some pretty fantastic results during graphical scenes, with judder now and again but a smooth experience the vast majority of the time. As for an overall score, you’re looking at two consecutive scores in the 173 000 range, being significantly higher than the Galaxy S7’s 129 000 or thereabouts. In fact, the S8’s score sees it landing at number two on the Antutu charts, with Apple’s iPhone 7 Plus being ahead of it. The GFX Bench 4 test also sees the Samsung device hand in a strong performance for the most part. It goes toe to toe with Apple’s best when it comes to the likes of the T-Rex test, ALU 2 run-through and several off-screen tests. Otherwise, the phone lags behind Apple’s best and/or Nvidia’s Shield TV when it comes to tests like Car Chase, Manhattan and texturing. In plain English, the Galaxy S8 silicon is a big step forward for Samsung in benchmarks, but Apple’s hardware/software synergy means it’s still pulling big numbers.

The phone unlocks in no time flat, multitasking is usually extremely snappy and responsive, apps launch quickly and scrolling (be it on the web or in apps) is a smooth endeavour. Sticklers for detail will probably notice a frameskip once in a blue moon, but it’s clear that we’ve got a speedy phone on our hands. It’s a long way away from the Galaxy S4 and its bloatware-ridden skin. In saying so, I did notice two random shutdowns in the three weeks I’ve been using it. The first shutdown took place when I was tinkering with the camera, failing to save the last photo I had taken at that moment. The second reboot came out of nowhere, as I stuck the phone in its box. The phone booted up a game as I placed it in the box (an accidental press due to the curved screen) and then, as I hit the home button to exit the game, it shut down. Very weird. In the gaming department, we played about half a dozen titles on the handset, starting with lighter/older fare like Nimble Quest, MNDZZ and Astra, then ramping it up with Nascar Heat Mobile, Motorsport Manager, Maximum Car and Fury Turn. The result? Well, the lightweight titles predictably ran without judder at all, but the heavier games didn’t disappoint either, running at a very smooth pace. Maximum Car in particular is a workout for many a phone, but it looks and feels great on the Galaxy S8. Now, about installing the Dolphin emulator and getting my GameCube library onto the phone… What does Samsung bring to the Android table? As for the actual TouchWiz skin, we’re glad to see Samsung isn’t quite returning to the heavy theme of yore. That’s not to say that the company hasn’t delivered plenty of customisations though… We’ve got a Pixel-style app drawer that I don’t particularly care for (swipe vertically to open your app list), a Bixby menu on the left-most homescreen that can fortunately be disabled, a persistent local search bar at the top of the app drawer, the now-standard device maintenance menu (to optimise battery life, free up RAM/storage etc) and a settings menu overhaul, among other things. In terms of preinstalled goodies/bloatware, the Galaxy S8 fares a wee bit worse than the S7. There’s the usual suite of Microsoft apps, Samsung Health, the Galaxy Apps store, Samsung Gear (why not make this an optional download?), the Samsung internet browser (a rather capable app), a Samsung Members app (for diagnostics, help etc), a Samsung Notes app, a Secure Folder app (why not add this functionality to the file explorer?) and of course, Bixby. To put it bluntly, Bixby is Samsung’s take on Google Now/Assistant and, at its best, the card-based aspect seems like a less capable version of Google Now. At its worst, Bixby is an unfinished product, due to the lack of voice commands at launch. And the voice aspect was a heavily hyped feature, with Samsung saying it represents a true natural language interface. TouchWiz on the Galaxy S8 looks and feels great, but that doesn’t mean Samsung got rid of bloatware Meanwhile, the Bixby Vision feature is another element that could do with some polish. No Bixby, that box of crackers isn’t toothpaste. Although I have to say that the Translate feature seems solid enough, using Google’s backbone to get things done. Now, if only it delivered offline support too… The biggest issue with Bixby is the fact that Samsung has delivered a physical button devoted to the feature. A feature that isn’t quite ready yet. This wouldn’t be as big of a deal if the company just let people customise the button. But no, the firm is strong-arming people into opening Bixby, even if it is an accidental launch. Probably so they can say “look, people are opening our app” at the Note 8 launch… There are indeed apps that let you remap the button (I’m using Bixby Remapper), but it’s not an ideal solution and Samsung has been clamping down. Here’s hoping they change course and introduce a native remapping option. When it comes to software, the Galaxy S8 is more proof that Samsung wants you to use its services rather than Google’s. That’s not to say that it’s reached the dizzy heights of Meizu and LeEco though. We still have a fast phone and a very pleasant user interface, while the menu when holding down on an app is a nice touch. But this is about as far as Samsung should go for its next release, before we have a repeat of the Galaxy S4. Is the camera any good? Does a bear poop in the woods? A post shared by Hadlee Simons (@brophylactic) on May 28, 2017 at 3:38am PDT The Galaxy S7 delivered a sensibly sized 12MP camera with a large f/1.7 aperture for improved low-light performance. And the results were fantastic, featuring Samsung’s trademark sharpness and saturated (but not overly so) colours. Night-time snaps were also a step ahead of the competition in many ways, sucking in more light than rivals. The Galaxy S8 has the same camera sensor, which means that you should reasonably expect quality snaps again. But, much like Google, Samsung has sought to differentiate itself by using software smarts to improve the camera experience, in the form of multi-frame image processing. Samsung’s technique sees a few images being combined for each shot taken, in order to reduce blur and improve low-light performance. Does it actually make a massive difference? I’m not sure, as I’d need a Galaxy S7 to do a side-by-side comparison. But the phone is still spitting out some great shots, with well-defined edges, accurate (if a tad saturated) colours and low levels of noise. Night time situations also see some great results and, when I took the S8 and P10 Plus to a live gig, the Samsung phone would often have less blur and seemed to have less noise. Is that due to the software smarts, better OIS or what? I don’t know, but it was clear that Samsung had a distinct advantage in that department. The Samsung Galaxy S8 takes some fantastic photos, but so did its predecessor Speaking of the competition, it’s clear that the 2017 crop of high-end phones are as close as ever when it comes to photo quality. You can see this in our G6/P10 Plus/Galaxy S8 camera comparison, where the difference mainly boils down to white balance and colour preference (although noise is a factor too). The difference also comes down to things like autofocus, with the phone being extremely quick on the draw due to a tweaked autofocus system. I haven’t really had any occasions where the phone failed to focus, save for those times when I got a little too close to a subject. Read more: Samsung Galaxy S8 – check these photo samples There were a few oddities though, like stubborn lens flares when taking outdoor snaps or a ghosted hand in one of our shots. To be fair, the former sometimes can’t be helped, but the latter was definitely a weird result. As for actual features, we’ve got the usual auto, pro, panorama, food, selective focus and virtual shot modes. The pro mode gets the job done well enough too, although the lack of LG-style focus peaking is a little disappointing. Nevertheless, Samsung still manages to stay level with Apple when it comes to fire and forget photography. No need for endless tweaking, no need for half a dozen shots — one or two will get the job done. One for video enthusiasts? We really enjoyed the Galaxy S7 video experience, delivering great quality recordings in 4K, 240fps slow-motion and 1080p/60fps flavours. The same great quality is on show here too, but those rumours of 1000fps video are unfounded. We went one step further with the Galaxy S8, taking the phone to a live gig. The result? You’ve got clips that are well-lit and feature less noise than many rival devices. It’s also worth noting that the phone has an AOP microphone for audio recording and, as the clip demonstrates, it’s capable of capturing good quality, distortion-free sound for the most part. My only qualm is that the company could’ve slapped on another AOP microphone for “richer” sound and HTC-style recording features (surround sound etc). Otherwise, the phone makes for a great buy if you value video quality above all else. And your shaky concert footage will actually sound decent. Will that 3000mAh battery last? The Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S8 share the same 3000mAh battery capacity, which is pretty much the baseline for a flagship smartphone these days. In fact, LG’s battery is slightly bigger (3300mAh) while Huawei’s P10 also edges out Samsung’s offering (3200mAh). In any event, I never found myself having to charge before leaving the newsroom on a typical day. My usual day of usage saw me chatting extensively on WhatsApp, listening to some tracks via Google Play Music and accessing email, often having 40% or more juice still left. Attending a conference is one of the more strenuous workouts for a phone, as I live-tweet, browse the web and generally punish the modem and screen. At the recent BotCon Africa event, I was live-tweeting pretty much 70% of the time, from about 10am to 4pm. The result was that the phone dipped below the 30% mark at about 2pm or so, subsequently plugging it into the power bank. A pretty good workout, but a solid showing from the phone. Still, I’d expect the likes of the Mate 9 (review) and other much larger phones to last a few hours longer. I did find however, that running benchmarks on the phone (two Antutu tests and GFX Bench) knocked double digits off the phone’s battery life. And you can expect streaming video to do similar damage. What about normal video playback? We put the phone through our usual video playback test, running a 20 second 1080p/60fps video on loop. We use MX Player, while enabling mobile data/WiFi and turning the brightness up to 100%. The result? It hit the 10% mark after eight hours and a few minutes, handily beating our five to six hour average. So that means you should be able to watch three movies on the plane, turning down the brightness and disabling connectivity to add a few hours. Still, if you’re worried about lasting for a day, the Galaxy S8 won’t let you down. In fact, if you forget to charge the night before, you should have enough juice for the morning. So it’s pretty much on par with the other flagships this year. The biometrics are a step backward and forward The elephant in the room really, is Samsung’s poorly placed, tiny fingerprint scanner. You’ll press the camera more times than you’d care to admit — and don’t get me started on the phone imploring me to cover the scanner with my entire finger. It works fine when you eventually get the hang of it, but yeah, the Galaxy S7’s scanner puts Samsung’s current flagship to shame. Although I still think the P9 has the best scanner on the market, owing to my preference for rear-mounted scanners. Then there’s the iris scanner, being much faster than my Lumia 950. The phone only takes a second or so to unlock, in a best case scenario. Unfortunately, much like Microsoft’s effort, it seldom works in direct sunlight, so you’ll need to use the fingerprint scanner or PIN code instead (or go to a shady spot). It works well in the dark though, owing to the use of infrared light to scan your iris. There are two other notable issues I have with Samsung’s iris scanner though. Firstly, why do I have to hit the power button and then swipe up to activate the scanner? A power button press like the 950 should automatically activate the scanner. This is even more apparent when the afterthought of a fingerprint scanner only requires a touch — no power button needed. [Update: we somehow missed that there was an option to enable iris scanning without a screen swipe. We’ve tweaked the score to reflect this.] The second iris-related issue (and one covered extensively here) is that you can’t improve your scanning profile like the aforementioned Microsoft phone. That means you can’t scan your iris with and without spectacles, for instance, or in a lighting situation that proves troublesome. Nevertheless, Samsung still lets you log into websites and the like via your biometrics, being very convenient. And the preinstalled Secure Folder utility means you can securely stash away your apps, photos and other files. Otherwise, Samsung has pulled a Huawei and delivered the ability to activate the dropdown menu with a fingerprint scanner swipe. So… should you get it? The Galaxy S8 is a less impressive leap from the Galaxy S7 than the LG G6 was from the G5. Then again, Samsung had already achieved greatness with the 2016 phone, while LG… well… hadn’t. Does the Galaxy S8 represent a big upgrade over the S7? Is it a skin-deep change only? Or is it a step back even? Well, the truth is that it’s a little bit of all three in many ways. We’ve got a solid but not great iris scanner, that gorgeous screen and a slick but “please-don’t-let-me-drop-it-for-the-love-of-all-that-is-holy” hardware design. Then there are the changes that are barely felt. Yes, the camera is excellent, but so was last year’s model. Sure, the phone is extremely nippy, but the S7 was a smooth operator too. Finally, we’ve got the departments that feel like a step back. There’s the tiny fingerprint scanner in a weird location. We’ve also got the return of an extra physical button — a good idea, but bad when Samsung forcibly ties it to Bixby. Speaking of Bixby, we’ve also got the return of software that duplicates Google functionality (Assistant/Now) for the sake of it. And it’s still not finished yet, lacking voice commands. Verdict: The Samsung Galaxy S8 packs a slick (water-resistant) design, snappy camera, brisk performance and a battery that punches slightly above its capacity. But if you’ve got a Galaxy S7 or S7 Edge, you actually have an equal or even better phone in many ways. Got an S6 or S6 Edge? Then you’re in for a treat.

Google confirms it will block bad ads in Chrome, starting in early 2018 Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/06/01 3:35pm PDTJun 1, 2017 52 Plus 1 on G+ 273 Share on Facebook 79 Share on Twitter Total Shares404 Applications Google News About two months ago, the Wall Street Journal reported that Google would add an ad-blocking feature into the Chrome web browser. Similar to AdBlock Plus' default setting, Chrome would block ads deemed unacceptable (such as pop-ups, auto-playing video ads, etc). Google has now confirmed this, and shared further details about how it will work. In a post on the company's blog, Google announced that it is joining the Coalition for Better Ads, an industry group attempting to improve online ads. The group has developed the Better Ads Standards, a list of guidelines for desktop and mobile ads based on comprehensive research. Ads deemed unacceptable include pop-ups, auto-playing video ads with sound, large sticky ads, and other common formats. In the post, Google confirmed that Chrome will soon not show ads, including those served by Google, on websites not in compliance with the Better Ads Standards. The change will take effect in "early 2018." This is huge news, especially considering that Google serves more online ads than any company on Earth. Now that Chrome has approximately 60% of the desktop browser market share (and growing), sites will likely have no choice than to follow the guidelines.

Mgamerz Great news, but I guarantee you there's going to be a shitstorm headed their way really quick. Corbin Davenport Oh for sure. Something something free market. bekifft This is huge. However if they don't address the issue of deceptive ads, it's still a big problem. Hopefully one day I can finally in good conscience stop installing ad blockers as simply a security measure to protect my users. Corbin Davenport I haven't looked through all of the standard's documentation, but I don't see anything about deceptive ads. But I agree, that should be addressed. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Using any download site is an exercise in frustration. "Which giant 'Download Here' button is the right one?! Oh, of course, it's the tiny text link buried between three of them." Santos Chavez Ugh, I hate those sites with a passion. They're part of the reason i vehemently block ads.

Gregory Will there be an option to block all ads without exceptions? Corbin Davenport Most likely not. Artem Russakovskii Sort of, but if you subscribe to sites running Funding Choices and use Contributor to buy an ad-free pass. Which is how it should be if you want to enjoy quality content from creators. Good ads and free if you don't. No ads and small fee if you do. Bimmer Ime or you can install an adblocker and enjoy no ads and no fee :) Tom Westrick And the sites you enjoy won't be able to sustain themselves... Nathan J Are they hurting now? Because that's what we have now. We have ad blockers, and we have ABP with its acceptable ads, but a lot of people turn it off. How about the sack on that guy, telling the main guy at AP to block ads on his own site? I'm a block-everything guy too, but I'm going to be seriously looking into this Funding Choices thing. I don't want my ad-free page views being wasted on just any old site, but sites I read daily, like AP and Neowin, I definitely want to see them get their cut. R Firestone ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ That would kill the internet and you would have to pay for everything. Ads are what make the internet free Gregory You know, they can always make money on others, not on me. Most people don't bother blocking ads, they simply don't care. Mark Curtis Yeah gimme free entertainment, but YOU foot the bill! David The internet was in fact a much *worse* place before ads became a thing. All the nice stuff you have access to now only exists because of ad revenue (email, YouTube, any and all social networking platforms) Toys Samurai He reminds me of some people whom I know -- always say they hate ads and would rather pay for it. But when the content provider actually asks for money, they don't open up their wallets. Jorgen Phillips This is the most hippocritical thing I think I have ever read. Toys Samurai Exactly. This very site he's reading would not even exist if everyone blocks ads. David That's not true, they could just use a different monetization model. Nathan J Hypocritical. You may be thinking of the hippocratic oath, where the famous phrase "do no harm" comes from. If only ads would pledge to do no harm... Nathan J There already is. That's what we have now. I mean, we have the no ad blocker option, which is default. Then you have Adblock Plus's default setting, which whitelists ads ABP considers to be not malicious. And that's what Google is doing. Then you have ABP with that feature turned off, or something like uBlock Origin, that just blocks all the ads indiscriminately. This is a future measure that is designed to be more tolerant than current "all or nothing" solutions, plus Google is an advertising business. So, there probably won't be. Eddy Nelson Lopez They profit from it, why would they do it? 😂😂 Corbin Davenport They won't profit from it if a majority of users have an ad blocker. Which is where things are headed right now. exadeci They can blocks ads from everyone except theirs and having the most popular browser they can sell the exclusivity to other ad agencies. Corbin Davenport "In the post, Google confirmed that Chrome will soon not show ads, including those served by Google, on websites not in compliance with the Better Ads Standards." exadeci Couldn't they just prevent bad ads on their platform?! Imparus The problem is how you serve them to the user. If you create a popup filled with Google ads, it would be bad ads even thought they are Google approved ads. exadeci Right but if they can detect it in Chrome why can't they use this to disable the ads on the website that abuses it? Sonny Bono I'm guessing it's a preventative measure, seeing how many people get virused through some popup ads that they don't realize are a pathway to malicious software. We certainly don't want another epidemic of ransomware. I find most of my service calls go to elderly people who have no idea what they're doing and get tons of malware/ransomware. One old lady I was working with a few weeks ago actually "called microsoft" per the directions on her browser and gave them her credit card number. It wasn't really microsoft. abqnm As long as it takes care of the shady JavaScript click event pop-unders and other such js deceptive ad techniques which are generally not able to be caught by ad-blockers. I would really love to be able to go back to having JavaScript enabled and blacklist only certain sites rather than have to keep it disabled and whitelist the majority of my internet experience. TW Does this mean my phone won't connect constantly start vibrating because of ads on legitimate sites? raazman I'm sorry you have to experience this is this day and age. AintaDamnThingFunny This!! I've always wondered how those got through Chrome's security. I mean, it's an obtrusive add that makes your phone vibrate, and all you can do is close out the browser. How the hell do those get through and how has Google not stopped this from happening? Imparus Because a website can access the vibrator API, this is useful in the example of facebook, where you can activate notification for the site, and not having to use their shitty app. TW Now I know what to call the thing I hate: Vibrator API BRO i prefer my phone silent, no notification sound or vibration, as i mostly use my pc with pushbullet mirroring Santos Chavez OMG I hate those types of ads! Especially when the ads that popup are so obstrusive I can't do anything but exit Chrome. Ugh! blindexecutioner Doesn't affect me much. I already block ads. Nathan J It's not meant to affect you or I or anyone else who knows what uBlock Origin is. Google Chrome is the most popular browser, so I imagine what it will affect is the 60% or however many people use Chrome, and all of a sudden they're blocking malicious ads. That will affect a lot. I suspect for you and I, we will probably be able to just disable Google's solution and use our own, and if Google blocks other ad blockers, there's always Chromium. AS The biggest annoyances for me are subscribe popovers and EU cookie warnings. Things like taboola and outbrain need to be aggressively blocked. Lateef Alabi-Oki I'll disable my ad blocker if this gets rid of malicious and egregious ads. Nexus Hexus I'm sure most of these "Bad ads" will be alternative media. Or aka "Whatever we don't agree with" boop It's not content that's blocked, but format. Sonny Bono Ironically, all the ads that I find bothersome are on google services themselves, such as YouTube, but I have a Chrome extension (ublock origin) that works to get rid of them. Santos Chavez I enjoy YouTube so much, I pay for YouTube Red, via the Google Play Music Family Plan . Haven't seen an ad, especially on mobile. for months, and I get unlimited music streaming and downloading, all of those features shared to 5 other users. Pretty neat. Gary But do they block those annoying as hell forced Google surveys? Lord Argyris "...Google confirmed that Chrome will soon not show ads, including those served by Google, on websites not in compliance with the Better Ads Standards." I'm going to guess they're including their own ads here to avoid anticompetitive suits from competing ad providers. If they just blocked the other ads and left their own (presumably compliant ads), they would be gaining an unfair advantage and could be seen to be leveraging their strength in the browser market to incentivize use of their own ad platform. I wondered about this in my comment on the previous AP article on the subject, and it seems Google has considered the matter as well. Santos Chavez Yeah, it's kinda neat; by doing it that way Google avoids all sorts of blames of being hypocrites while also setting the example for everyone. "THIS", they say, "is how ads should be done. Look, we're even doing them to our own; you should, too". Terra Remove the ads that play before a video and we got a deal. Small banners below the video? Ok. Playing a commercial before the content I actually want to see? That is old tv bullcrap and is annoying as hell, even more so than popups. Dennis Ulijn "But, but, but...

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars AI AI Weekly: Siri, please meet Alexa and Google Assistant Blaise Zerega@BeeZee June 1, 2017 8:53 PM What a difference a year makes. The headlines this week could have been pulled from last spring: intelligent assistants, voice interfaces, and devices. But in 2017, different flavors of machine learning underpin all of them. Hello, Google Assistant. Hello, Alexa. Please meet Siri. Yes, Apple has finally begun extending Siri to a new line of smart speakers. While the devices may not be available until later this year, Apple watchers are hoping to learn how they work with Apple’s other products and services at the upcoming WWDC event. Meanwhile, here at AI Weekly, we’re watching to see just how smart Siri can become. At the same time, interoperability is improving. You can now use Amazon Alexa to add appointments to your Apple iCloud calendar. This rounds out Alexa’s access to G Suite, Outlook and Office 365 calendars. While less lofty than pondering machine learning, we’re keen to see whether such cross-platform uses spark entirely new services. Recombinant DNA, anyone?

President's Paris climate speech annotated: Trump's claims analysed Read more In separate statements and messages on social media, leaders of Apple, Google, Twitter, Amazon, Facebook, Tesla, Microsoft and IBM declared climate change an “urgent” threat that required a global effort to combat. “Decision to withdraw from the #ParisAgreeement was wrong for our planet,” said Apple CEO Tim Cook tweeted on Thursday. “Apple is committed to fight climate change and we will never waver.” Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey called the decision “incredibly shortsighted” and a “move backwards by the federal government”. He also retweeted several stories and statements disapproving of Trump’s move to extract the US from the Paris agreement, including a message from the new French president, Emmanuel Macron, that read: Make Our Planet Great Again. jack (@jack) This is an incredibly shortsighted move backwards by the federal government. We're all on this planet together and we need to work together. https://t.co/tLEdtG0n1o June 1, 2017 Facebook CEO Mark Zuckererg said Trump’s decision “puts our children’s future at risk”. He said the social media giant was committed to ensuring that every new data center is powered by 100% renewable energy. “Stopping climate change is something we can only do as a global community, and we have to act together before it’s too late,” Zuckerberg said in a Facebook post. Google CEO Sundar Pichai tweeted: “Disappointed with today’s decision. Google will keep working hard for a cleaner, more prosperous future for all.” Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, followed through with his promise to step down from two of Trump’s business advisory councils if the president removed the US from the global climate agreement. IBM said in a statement that the tech company “supported and still supports US participation in the Paris agreement”. IBM said, however, confirmed that its CEO, Ginni Rometty, will remain on Trump’s business advisory council. Trump just cemented his legacy as America’s worst-ever president | Dana Nuccitelli Read more “IBM believes that it is easier to lead outcomes by being at the table, as a participant in the agreement, rather than from outside it,” the statement said. Microsoft president Brad Smith said in a statement the company has been a “steadfast supporter of the Paris agreement” and was therefore “disappointed with today’s decision by the White House”. Smith said his company had worked for months to persuade Trump to remain in the Paris agreement, though ultimately that effort came up short. “We’ve sent letters to and held meeting on this topic with senior officials in the state department and the White House. And in the past month, we’ve joined with other American business leaders to take out full-page ads in the New York Times, Wall Street Journal and New York Post, urging the administration to keep the United States in the Paris agreement,” Smith said in a statement. Microsoft was part of handful of influential technology firms behind an eleventh-hour push to keep the US in the Paris climate accord ahead of his Thursday announcement in the White House rose garden. “Climate change presents both business risks and business opportunities,” read a letter signed by more than two dozen companies and published as a full-page advertisement in several US newspapers on Thursday morning. “Continued US participation in the agreement benefits US businesses and the US economy in many ways.” Topics Technology Mark Zuckerberg Jack Dorsey Donald Trump Climate change COP 21: UN climate change conference | Paris Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Reuse this content View all comments > Order by newest oldest recommendations Show 25 25 50 100 All Threads collapsed expanded unthreaded Loading comments… Trouble loading?

[Update: Site is live, more details] Google launches Funding Choices, a way for users to pay sites to hide ads Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/06/01 8:01pm PDTJun 1, 2017 35 Plus 1 on G+ 77 Share on Facebook 59 Share on Twitter Total Shares171 Games News Update 1: 2017/06/01 8:01pm PDT The new site for Google Contributor/Funding Choices is live, and offers some new insight into how the service actually works. According to the signup page, each page without ads You may recall Google Contributor, which was a service by Google that allowed users to pay a monthly contribution to see fewer ads online. Your money would directly substitute the money earned by the site for advertisements. Contributor was discontinued in late 2016, with Google saying that an improved version would become available in "early 2017." Today, the company launched Funding Choices, the successor to Contributor. Currently in beta, it allows sites to show a customized message to visitors using an ad blocker. The message asks users to either enable ads for the site, or pay for a pass through Contributor that removes all ads on that site. Unlike the original Contributor, Funding Choices hides more than just AdSense ads If you're reading this and thinking, "I really wish Android Police would do this," then you're in luck. We've been part of Google's internal beta, but we're not quite ready to roll it out. Just know that we are definitely working on it. The new Contributor site doesn't seem to be live yet, but there will likely be more details there soon. Source: Google Update 1: 2017/06/01 8:01pm PDT The new site for Google Contributor/Funding Choices is live, and offers some new insight into how the service actually works. According to the signup page, each page without ads that you view on a site costs a small amount, with publishers apparently able to change the price (most of them seem to use $0.01 per page right now). So assuming $0.01 per page, $1 gets you 100 pages without ads, and Google is offering a $5 pass to start out with. Not bad pricing at all, as long as sites stay around the $0.01 price point. Google also offers a list of sites supporting Google Contributor, which currently includes Beliefnet, Business Insider UK, ComicBook, Eurogamer, Grub Street, Hot Air, Parkers, Patheos, Popular Mechanics, Townhall, Twitchy, and World Wide Gaming.

NexusPhan The ads in AP are not bad. Very reasonable and not intrusive at all. I have this site whitelisted to help support their great work. You should consider it too before funding choices goes live. MJ There is certainly websites with much more obnoxious ads but their is a lot of ads on AP. It's just not an acceptable user experience and I not going to subject myself to it. I have been calling for a way to donate to AP for awhile now (why did AP have to wait for a Google solution?) so we see how this plays out. Alex Dueppen Unfortunately Disqus hasn't been the same way, it seems to often load ads that redirect you to those scam "You are winner" pages that try to look like facebook.

I remember that now that you say it. I enabled ad blocker for a few months after it happened. Corbin Davenport I will say that those are normally from Disqus, and we've worked with Disqus in the past to identify them and get them removed. ZettabyteGamer I'm sure it would be hard but if disqus is causing so many problems, maybe you should switch to a different comment section or make your own? Justin W I'd agree that AP's ads aren't bad, but Disqus's are terrible. Irwin LOL are you seriuos? on mobile, like half the site is all ads. It's ridiculous. blueman24 I'm ok with whitelist for sites like AP on desktop but on mobile, I don't want any ads. AP can add 5 more ads on their desktop site but don't cripple performance on my already slow phone. Rashad Would it be a one time cost or is this a cost each time we visit a participating site? Corbin Davenport I believe it's a monthly subscription, just like the previous Contributor. MJ Questions? Why did AP have to wait for a Google solution? There are many ways you could have been collecting money all this time. A automatic monthly subscription? Sounds like a loser already as people hate that. It's not going to be a set amount but like pick an amount right? An annual subscription would make more sense. Why can't there just be a simple donate button so people could send money when they can and just continuing blocking the ads ourselves like we have been already doing? Cai Copley It's that you do it in one, centralized location for such a subscription, and not doing it over a series of sites and forgetting how much you're spending. MJ I guess need more details on how it works... Jeff Beck We'll have a special rate for you MJ. .005 cents per article, $15 per grumpy comment submitted. We are going to make a fortune off you ;) George https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4ba5750c423a92daff44db461bb3042c433e0f5e7edc1f8dadcb32198db0d5e8.jpg Mark Curtis Or just block ads and not pay! I'm entitled to free content! gimme gimme gimme. faceless128 it's about safety. there are so many malicious advertisements out there. if a site doesn't directly control the ads that show up, how can they ensure our safety? Camerooni I use privacy badger.. if it blocks ads that play bad - I'm okay with that alongside blocking tracking cookies etc. What I don't like is sites assuming that if you're blocking an ad network that plays bad with you that you're the bad guy.. Things have to work both ways. Ailín Ó’S I wonder will this work internationally or just USA only because I use adblock and don't have AP (for example) whitelisted because of the sheer volume of ads on the site especially from the likes of Disqus with their "Congrats! You're a winner!" and "Local man makes 999.999€ a day with this trick!" spam. cadtek91 I'd imagine it would work with anyone with a Google account? Fabrice Thomas Seems like it's only available in these contries: US, Germany, New Zealand and UK https://support.google.com/contributor/answer/6182581?hl=en Jeff Beck If you want to just pay me directly I'll give you my PayPal address. That'll make things even easier on you. I know, I'm way too nice to you all, you're welcome. TechGuy22 Thanks but I'll stick adblock and adaway needa If you guys are wanting input, which I know you didn't ask for, five bucks a year would be my max. Not sure how it works, but I would want that on my mobile device. Desktop chrome has what I need in an extension. Ultimately that would earn more money from me, as i get on this sight far less with mobile chrome. Good_Ole_Pinocchio 5 bucks a year? What does that Pay for? Beer for the staff? needa If everyone that comes to this site with adblock paid five bucks, I doubt they would complain. Jeffrey Spiers Brave browser has this built into the browser directly, have used the feature on some of my most frequented sites. Switched to Brave due to many sites detecting and bitching about ad blockers recently. Good_Ole_Pinocchio Web Ads are trash, always. But I've never used ad blockers. Because if I'm taking the content, I'm taking the ads, or I just don't go to the site if the ads are really horrible. I'd more than pay for no ads. psy spy You have to sign in to your gmail account for this to work? Easier to track us. _jack_ It would be nicer to have this from another company, yes. I also wonder, how much Google keeps for themselves? Lord Argyris The official blurb is a little vague. Each time I visit a page without ads, my pass/account/whatever has the site's chosen cost deducted from it. What constitutes a "page"? If I refresh the tab, does that count as an additional page load? What if I visit an article again at a later date? What about those obnoxious sites that have an automatic reload timer? Could they game FC users? I'm sure all these questions will be answered in time. What I would have liked to have seen is some sort of a multiple tier system, whereby I can select specific participants (e.g AP) and offer to pay a flat monthly rate rather than a per-page fee, then leave the normal fee structure in place for others. It would be an easy way to donate more than I would ordinarily accumulate to places I come frequently, without forcing said sites to set up their own donation system. No matter what tier FC visitors choose, the site gets money. FelschR It's stated quite clearly: "Note: you are charged each time you visit or refresh a page, even if you have previously visited it." https://support.google.com/contributor/answer/7359560?hl=en&ref_topic=6182570 Matías Duarte I've only used AdBlock for AP the moment that those ads magically opened a new popup while scrolling without even touching them. Now that the annoying problem is gone, I've disabled it. I know no one cares about this but I finally got accepted for a job and I'll get my very first payment tomorrow, so I would happily pay a contribution for this page! Jeff Beck I'll be one to care. Congrats! Getting paid is awesome. At least that's what the other writers at AP tell me. ZettabyteGamer How long till I can use this with you guys? I'm itching to try it out, but this is the only site I really read everyday. Necdet Ali Özdür I think the real question here is what Google means by "fewer ads". Are all kinds of ads will be blocked or just intrusive ones? Will the trackers also be removed? someone755 Hmmm... https://youtu.be/4ezd24krgiQ Powsniffer0110 I'd be happy to pay 1¢ an article on AP and Phandroid, XDA ect.! Powsniffer0110 This is funny as hell lol. We're now paying Google to NOT give us ads... Haha.

Google confirms it will block bad ads in Chrome, starting in early 2018 Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/06/01 3:35pm PDTJun 1, 2017 52 Plus 1 on G+ 273 Share on Facebook 79 Share on Twitter Total Shares404 Applications Google News About two months ago, the Wall Street Journal reported that Google would add an ad-blocking feature into the Chrome web browser. Similar to AdBlock Plus' default setting, Chrome would block ads deemed unacceptable (such as pop-ups, auto-playing video ads, etc). Google has now confirmed this, and shared further details about how it will work. In a post on the company's blog, Google announced that it is joining the Coalition for Better Ads, an industry group attempting to improve online ads. The group has developed the Better Ads Standards, a list of guidelines for desktop and mobile ads based on comprehensive research. Ads deemed unacceptable include pop-ups, auto-playing video ads with sound, large sticky ads, and other common formats. In the post, Google confirmed that Chrome will soon not show ads, including those served by Google, on websites not in compliance with the Better Ads Standards. The change will take effect in "early 2018." This is huge news, especially considering that Google serves more online ads than any company on Earth. Now that Chrome has approximately 60% of the desktop browser market share (and growing), sites will likely have no choice than to follow the guidelines.

Can get rid of those annoying app install ads when browsing on the phone! Corbin Davenport Yeah, I think those are included, since they stick to the top while scrolling. Mgamerz Great news, but I guarantee you there's going to be a shitstorm headed their way really quick. Corbin Davenport Oh for sure. Something something free market. bekifft This is huge. However if they don't address the issue of deceptive ads, it's still a big problem. Hopefully one day I can finally in good conscience stop installing ad blockers as simply a security measure to protect my users. Corbin Davenport I haven't looked through all of the standard's documentation, but I don't see anything about deceptive ads. But I agree, that should be addressed. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Using any download site is an exercise in frustration. "Which giant 'Download Here' button is the right one?!

Gregory Will there be an option to block all ads without exceptions? Corbin Davenport Most likely not. Artem Russakovskii Sort of, but if you subscribe to sites running Funding Choices and use Contributor to buy an ad-free pass. Which is how it should be if you want to enjoy quality content from creators. Good ads and free if you don't. No ads and small fee if you do. Bimmer Ime or you can install an adblocker and enjoy no ads and no fee :) Tom Westrick And the sites you enjoy won't be able to sustain themselves... Nathan J Are they hurting now? Because that's what we have now. We have ad blockers, and we have ABP with its acceptable ads, but a lot of people turn it off. How about the sack on that guy, telling the main guy at AP to block ads on his own site? I'm a block-everything guy too, but I'm going to be seriously looking into this Funding Choices thing. I don't want my ad-free page views being wasted on just any old site, but sites I read daily, like AP and Neowin, I definitely want to see them get their cut. R Firestone ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ That would kill the internet and you would have to pay for everything. Ads are what make the internet free Gregory You know, they can always make money on others, not on me. Most people don't bother blocking ads, they simply don't care. Mark Curtis Yeah gimme free entertainment, but YOU foot the bill! David The internet was in fact a much *worse* place before ads became a thing. All the nice stuff you have access to now only exists because of ad revenue (email, YouTube, any and all social networking platforms) Toys Samurai He reminds me of some people whom I know -- always say they hate ads and would rather pay for it. But when the content provider actually asks for money, they don't open up their wallets. Jorgen Phillips This is the most hippocritical thing I think I have ever read. Toys Samurai Exactly. This very site he's reading would not even exist if everyone blocks ads. David That's not true, they could just use a different monetization model. Nathan J Hypocritical. You may be thinking of the hippocratic oath, where the famous phrase "do no harm" comes from. If only ads would pledge to do no harm... Nathan J There already is. That's what we have now. I mean, we have the no ad blocker option, which is default. Then you have Adblock Plus's default setting, which whitelists ads ABP considers to be not malicious. And that's what Google is doing. Then you have ABP with that feature turned off, or something like uBlock Origin, that just blocks all the ads indiscriminately. This is a future measure that is designed to be more tolerant than current "all or nothing" solutions, plus Google is an advertising business. So, there probably won't be. Eddy Nelson Lopez They profit from it, why would they do it? 😂😂 Corbin Davenport They won't profit from it if a majority of users have an ad blocker. Which is where things are headed right now. exadeci They can blocks ads from everyone except theirs and having the most popular browser they can sell the exclusivity to other ad agencies. Corbin Davenport "In the post, Google confirmed that Chrome will soon not show ads, including those served by Google, on websites not in compliance with the Better Ads Standards." exadeci Couldn't they just prevent bad ads on their platform?! Imparus The problem is how you serve them to the user. If you create a popup filled with Google ads, it would be bad ads even thought they are Google approved ads. exadeci Right but if they can detect it in Chrome why can't they use this to disable the ads on the website that abuses it? Sonny Bono I'm guessing it's a preventative measure, seeing how many people get virused through some popup ads that they don't realize are a pathway to malicious software. We certainly don't want another epidemic of ransomware. I find most of my service calls go to elderly people who have no idea what they're doing and get tons of malware/ransomware. One old lady I was working with a few weeks ago actually "called microsoft" per the directions on her browser and gave them her credit card number. It wasn't really microsoft. abqnm As long as it takes care of the shady JavaScript click event pop-unders and other such js deceptive ad techniques which are generally not able to be caught by ad-blockers. I would really love to be able to go back to having JavaScript enabled and blacklist only certain sites rather than have to keep it disabled and whitelist the majority of my internet experience. TW Does this mean my phone won't connect constantly start vibrating because of ads on legitimate sites? raazman I'm sorry you have to experience this is this day and age. AintaDamnThingFunny This!! I've always wondered how those got through Chrome's security. I mean, it's an obtrusive add that makes your phone vibrate, and all you can do is close out the browser. How the hell do those get through and how has Google not stopped this from happening? Imparus Because a website can access the vibrator API, this is useful in the example of facebook, where you can activate notification for the site, and not having to use their shitty app. TW Now I know what to call the thing I hate: Vibrator API BRO i prefer my phone silent, no notification sound or vibration, as i mostly use my pc with pushbullet mirroring Santos Chavez OMG I hate those types of ads! Especially when the ads that popup are so obstrusive I can't do anything but exit Chrome. Ugh! blindexecutioner Doesn't affect me much. I already block ads. Nathan J It's not meant to affect you or I or anyone else who knows what uBlock Origin is. Google Chrome is the most popular browser, so I imagine what it will affect is the 60% or however many people use Chrome, and all of a sudden they're blocking malicious ads. That will affect a lot. I suspect for you and I, we will probably be able to just disable Google's solution and use our own, and if Google blocks other ad blockers, there's always Chromium. AS The biggest annoyances for me are subscribe popovers and EU cookie warnings. Things like taboola and outbrain need to be aggressively blocked. Lateef Alabi-Oki I'll disable my ad blocker if this gets rid of malicious and egregious ads. Nexus Hexus I'm sure most of these "Bad ads" will be alternative media. Or aka "Whatever we don't agree with" boop It's not content that's blocked, but format. Sonny Bono Ironically, all the ads that I find bothersome are on google services themselves, such as YouTube, but I have a Chrome extension (ublock origin) that works to get rid of them. Santos Chavez I enjoy YouTube so much, I pay for YouTube Red, via the Google Play Music Family Plan . Haven't seen an ad, especially on mobile. for months, and I get unlimited music streaming and downloading, all of those features shared to 5 other users. Pretty neat. Gary But do they block those annoying as hell forced Google surveys? Lord Argyris "...Google confirmed that Chrome will soon not show ads, including those served by Google, on websites not in compliance with the Better Ads Standards." I'm going to guess they're including their own ads here to avoid anticompetitive suits from competing ad providers. If they just blocked the other ads and left their own (presumably compliant ads), they would be gaining an unfair advantage and could be seen to be leveraging their strength in the browser market to incentivize use of their own ad platform. I wondered about this in my comment on the previous AP article on the subject, and it seems Google has considered the matter as well. Santos Chavez Yeah, it's kinda neat; by doing it that way Google avoids all sorts of blames of being hypocrites while also setting the example for everyone. "THIS", they say, "is how ads should be done. Look, we're even doing them to our own; you should, too". Terra Remove the ads that play before a video and we got a deal. Small banners below the video? Ok. Playing a commercial before the content I actually want to see? That is old tv bullcrap and is annoying as hell, even more so than popups. Dennis Ulijn "But, but, but...

The Siri Speaker seems like it will be a voice-controlled device in your home that happens to be able to emit sound. But I think there’s a different target Apple’s going after: Sonos. Remember, this isn’t rumored to just be a voice-controlled device with a speaker thrown in for audio feedback. Reports peg this as a device which contains multiple, high-quality speakers. In early May, KGI Securities’ Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said: We expect Apple’s first home AI product will have excellent acoustics performance (one woofer + seven tweeters) and computing power (similar to iPhone 6/6S AP). Seven tweeters. Amazon’s Echo at US$179.99, by comparison, has one woofer and one tweeter, as does the $199 Sonos PLAY:1. Even Sonos’s Flagship PLAY:5 at $499 only has six speakers, though three of those are woofers (the remaining three are tweeters). Yesterday’s report from Mark Gurman and Alex Webb writing at Bloomberg states: The device will differ from Amazon.com Inc.’s Echo and Alphabet Inc.’s Google Home speakers by offering virtual surround sound technology […] Virtual surround sound. This is starting to sound like the technology that Sonos has baked into its PLAYBASE and PLAYBAR (and, used a little differently, in the aforementioned PLAY:5, as well). Amazon and Google aren’t doing that with any of their current offerings. Twitter User @iFunnyVlogger’s rendering of what the Siri Speaker might look like. I would expect a device with seven tweeters to provide truly room-filling sound, perhaps from all angles given that each of those tweeters could be aimed in slightly different directions. This might be something that could pair with an Apple TV and not only play music but also play the audio for your TV shows and movies. The Siri Speaker may be more of a living room device than a kitchen device. For additional support, let’s include this tidbit from the same Ming-Chi Kuo report: […] likely to be positioned for: (i) the high-end market; (ii) better entertainment experience; and (iii) higher price than Amazon Echo. Better entertainment experience is something none of the existing voice-controlled home assistants seem to boast or even target. Given the popularity and functional usefulness of the $49 Amazon Echo Dot and its one, tiny speaker, it could easily be argued that the Alexa product line completely omits the I-care-about-sound-quality market (feel free to leave your “but Bluetooth!” comments below). Given the reported Siri Speaker’s enhanced acoustics and higher price points I’m thinking this thing targets the Sonos market: people that care about audio quality. It could perhaps finally be the first device that truly competes with Sonos (again, feel free to leave your comments about Bose and Polk below… I’ve tried those systems, folks, and I stand by the previous sentence). Sonos Killer? I’ll stop well-short of applying the term “Sonos killer” here, though. Sonos already has excellent support for Apple Music and every other streaming platform available. I would be surprised if Apple’s Siri speaker did that upon launch, too, though it’s not outside the realm of possibilities. Remember, your iPhone supports this stuff, and if the reported Siri Speaker processor speed is even close to accurate, there’s no reason that this device couldn’t run apps to support third-party services just like the Apple TV does. If Apple can truly release a high-quality speaker that is audibly-controlled and supports multiple music services including Apple Music, they would potentially have something very, very compelling to offer. Sonos is due to release their Alexa support later this year, but I’ve had a chance to approximate that with a hacked-together setup. Even with my hack’s imperfections, controlling music with one’s voice is true bliss and is most definitely the future of products like this. Let’s just hope Siri doesn’t interpret “Play Stevie Wonder” as “Hey, this is a steaming blunder.” Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn Reddit More Print Tumblr Tags: Apple TV, Siri speaker, sonos You might also like… Get Free Bitcoins from 23 Faucets That Pay The Touchbar MacBook Pro is a Disposable Embarrassment The 5 Best PC Motherboards for Creating a Hackintosh The 5 Best Hackintosh Graphics Cards Apple Music Is Turning Apple into a Media Giant 3 Comments Add a comment Andrush June 1, 2017 Hey Dave, you may be right to suggest that “Apple’s going after Sonos” but I have to say that the rest of your comments are rubbish. Are we talking about a mono BGM system or are we talking about 5.1 channel surround sound? Either way, there is a clear differentiation between streaming services and the number of tweeters in a speaker enclosure. “I would expect a device with seven tweeters to provide truly room-filling sound, perhaps from all angles given that each of those tweeters could be aimed in slightly different directions.” Say What ???

By Chris Duckett | June 2, 2017 -- 02:28 GMT (19:28 PDT) | Topic: Security Google has highlighted 42 Android devices where the majority of users are running security updates from the last two months. Leading the way in sheer numbers is Samsung with 14 devices ranging from its Galaxy S5 Dual SIM model up to the Galaxy S8 Plus, and covering some budget models and one tablet, the Galaxy Tab S2 9.7. LG Electronics has four devices on the list, as does General Mobile. Vivo has three models that made the cut. Unsurprisingly, Google's own Pixel and Nexus devices from the Nexus 6 and up make the list. When the window is opened to three months' worth of security updates, Google said more than 100 devices would make the list. The Android owner revealed the list in a blog post where the company announced it was bumping up the top tier of its Android Security Rewards program. A remote exploit chain or exploit leading to TrustZone or Verified Boot compromise will be quadrupled to $200,000, while a remote kernel exploit quintuples to $150,000. Google said the increases were a result of not having paid out its top reward for two years. The search giant said over the course of the last year it has paid 115 individuals an average of $2,150 per reward. Overall, $1.1 million was paid in the second year of the bounty scheme. Google's latest security update in Android addressed a remote code excution issue, and its Nexus 6 handsets are set to stop receiving guaranteed security updates in October.

The company today set the record straight regarding its plans, and it’s not quite what the speculation suggested. Google has joined the Coalition for Better Ads, a group that offers specific standards for how the industry should improve ads for consumers — full-page ad interstitials, ads that unexpectedly play sound, and flashing ads are all banned. Chrome will stop showing ads (including those owned or served by Google) on websites that are not compliant with the Better Ads Standards “starting in early 2018.” In other words, Google will use Chrome to cut off ad revenue from websites that serve low-quality ads, as deemed by the aforementioned standards. That means the browser’s built-in ad blocker will be taking an all-or-nothing approach: All ads blocked if one ad doesn’t follow the standards or all ads allowed through if they all follow the standards. The hope is that this will stymie the usage of add-ons and extensions that block all ads outright. Google acknowledges that ad blockers like this hurt publishers (like VentureBeat) that create free content “and threatens the sustainability of the web ecosystem.” Interestingly, despite the fact that Google makes the vast majority of its revenue from ads, the company says it sees this type of selective browser ad blocker the natural evolution of pop-up blockers. But the Chrome ad blocker coming next year isn’t the only thing Google is doing. The company is also launching the Ad Experience Report, a tool which provides screenshots and videos of annoying ad experiences to help sites find and fix issues. Developers can re-submit their site for review once the problematic ad experiences have been addressed. For a full list of ads to use instead, Google recommends that publishers visit its new best practices guide.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Samsung’s Bixby launch in US delayed due to syntax, grammar issues By Ida Torres - June 1, 2017 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter When Samsung launched its newest flagship, the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+, one of its selling points was the inclusion of Bixby, its own artificial intelligence virtual assistant. But while it is already available in its native South Korea, it looks like the US launch of the AI service is going to be delayed. Sources close to the issue have said this is due to the fact that they are encountering syntax and grammar issues with the English language. Bixby is Samsung’s counterpart to Apple’s Siri, Amazon’s Alexa, and Google’s, well, Google Assistant and uses AI to bring voice-activated assistance to users. Sources are saying that internal testing show that the program is having a hard time understanding English syntax and grammar and is still weeks away from being ready for launch. Originally, Samsung said that it will be ready for launch in the US “later this spring” but based on this, that will probably be a long shot. All eyes were on the new smartphones from Samsung, mostly because of the whole Galaxy Note 7 debacle of 2016. Sales numbers so far indicate that the public may have been a bit more forgiving as in South Korea alone, they exceeded the one million units mark in just 37 days. They have not released numbers for the US, but they did say that the pre-orders have surpassed that of the Galaxy S7 from the year before. Now as to whether the delay of Bixby will affect sales of the well-reviewed Galaxy S8, that remains to be seen. Industry experts are saying that virtual assistants are still not hitting it off with smartphone users and a study says that only 9% are actually using these services. Let’s wait and see.

The Internet search engine giant describes the feature as an ad "filter" rather than a "block" -- similar to current Chrome software that warns users of harmful software known as malware. The new setting won't allow ads from appearing on websites that are deemed to provide a bad advertising experience for users. Smaller sites often rely on lower-quality ads the most. But Google plans to give publishers a six-month head start for the new tool to be introduced as part of its Chrome browser. It will provide a self-service tool -- Ad Experience Reports -- to alert publishers of offending ads on their sites and tell them how to fix the problem. A publisher's site will receive a score and will learn which ads are "annoying experiences." Unacceptable ads by the Coalition for Better Ads, an industry group that includes trade bodies and online advertising-related companies, include pop-ups, auto-playing video ads with sound and "prestitial" ads that count down before content appears. Google is a member of the group as well as Facebook. "We've all known for a while that the ad experience is a real problem, and that it's confused and angered users," Sridhar Ramaswamy, senior vice president of ads and commerce at Google, told Ad Age. "We realized solutions like ad blockers punish everybody, including publishers who develop great content and are thoughtful about the ad experience they put on their site." Google's idea is a way to encourage Chrome users to turn off existing software that blocks all ads, CNBC reported. Online advertising revenue accounted for 88 percent of the $90 billion in revenue last year for parent Alphabet Inc.

Last year it was 74% - an acceleration that demonstrates the competitive advantage of scale companies have online or as the report's author Mary Meeker succinctly writes: "Big Get Bigger & Go After Other Bigs." Meeker is a partner at KPCB, one of the first VC firms on Silicon Valley's famed Sand Hill Rd. She was a popular Wall Street analyst during the dotcom boom. Here are some of the extremely worrying Internet trends for those media companies that are not Google and Facebook: - Meeker points to an up for grabs $16 billion annual opportunity in mobile ads which should be good news for media companies. However, huge numbers of people with ad blockers are blocking this money. Google and Facebook are less affected by this issue and are making a fortune in mobile ads. - Meeker warns that tying ad metrics to return on investment is a huge challenge and that there is a "triple-edge" to having accurate data. You might not like what it reveals about the effectiveness of some ad networks. - Consumers say they want targeted ads but they don't want to be tracked which is a huge problem for publishers. Google and Facebook have a big advantage because they don't need cookies to target users due to logins and owning popular services. Mary Meeker's Internet report: User growth slowing, but disruption full speed ahead Leading technology analyst Mary Meeker takes her 20th look into the state of the Internet. Read More - Media companies cannot compete with additional marketing services from Google and Facebook that can monitor real-time conversations; incorporate location based ads; and demonstrate offline effects by showing retailers how they can drive foot traffic in addition to online visitors. [I called it "Vectors of Engagement" in a 2014 column.] - In perspective: in 2016 Google and Facebook took $5.67 for each $1 of new business won by other media. It's an accelerating trend: A year ago the duo took $3.17 in new business for each $1 by everyone else. Meeker calls this pace of media disruption "torrid". Foremski's Take: "The trend is your friend" is sage Wall Street investment advice but there is nothing friendly about these Internet trends for any media company other than Google and Facebook. These two giants used to compete aggressively against each other with Google launching its own social media network and Facebook aligning with Microsoft in search. But those ventures were sidelined by the end of 2014 in favor of exploiting growth opportunities in their own areas. Was this done by agreement or in response to market conditions? asks long-time Google watcher Scott Cleland. This accelerating dominance of Google and Facebook in online advertising is being examined by European Union regulators. However, any regulatory actions will do nothing to help reverse the fortunes of struggling media companies because we still lack a stable media business model accessible to all. Also, the Meeker report does nothing to address a massive issue for all media companies: online ads continue to lose value. For example, Google reports less money per ad but somehow each quarter it manages to show even more of them and sail past Walls Street analyst estimates. Greater numbers of less effective ads is not a sustainable business model for any media company including Google. The media industry apocalypse continues. And as the media sector shrinks companies are having to tell their own stories and become their own media companies, to standout, to make sure they are seen to be seen because if they don't they'll cease to exist. If we had a healthy media sector this wouldn't be needed.

Homepage Sign in / Sign up Aleks JakulinBlockedUnblockFollowFollowing Information Economy Jun 1 What has Internet done to Media? This essay contains my thoughts about how Internet has been evolving over the past 20 years. It contains my analysis, supporting links and my recommendations. These ideas have been driving me over the past decade to develop a set of improved technologies, practices and standards. If this resonates with you, if you have ideas on how to improve this document, please reach out to aleks+ie@ganxy.com. Let’s bring different people, efforts and organizations together and fulfill the dream that was at the core of Internet: to unleashing the potential of networked humanity. 1. Introduction Internet originated from an effort to develop reliable communications in the case of a nuclear war. It’s been an incredible success even in peacetime, a science fiction tale come true: Internet now connects well over 3 billion people, provides access to information and services using tiny devices we carry in our pockets. The change to the society that the Internet will cause will be as large or larger than Gutenberg’s press, internal combustion engine, airplanes or electricity, and we’re yet to see the full extent of its impact. Internet, unfortunately, isn’t fulfilling its potential for several reasons: Violation of the information property rights through piracy and “scraping” has eliminated a source of income for developers, journalists, authors, and artists, reducing both quality and quantity of Internet content. Much valuable information is not yet online, or not easily found, even if there’s a market for it. The fundamental reason for this is rigidity of licensing contracts and practices. It’s unnecessarily hard to create a sustainable content business online: advertising is inadequate, and charging for information on the global web is encumbered by legacy regulation. The internet is putting the public in danger: there is an increasing amount of false and misleading information online, leading to political polarization, extremist movements, and terrorism. The practices are inadequate, and there’s a lack of a system. The collection of personal data is threatening democracy with the emergence of a number of powerful private surveillance organizations. Again, the regulation is futile and inadequate. Fortunately, there is a solution. Protection of personal and private data is a universal human right, but we need to enforce it. In order to develop and distribute protected information online, we need to implement better licensing technologies. To increase the quality and trustworthiness of information, we need to set up systems for reviewing, versioning, and reputation. Consequently, the Internet will develop its full potential, and we will create more than a billion jobs in the sustainable information economy. 2. Value of Data and Content The Internet emerged by connecting communities of researchers, but as Internet grew, antisocial behaviors were not adequately discouraged. When I coauthored several internet standards (PNG, JPEG, MNG), I was guided by the vision of connecting humanity. Groups of volunteers like myself were developing open standards that would allow programmers to create internet software without restrictions or taxes. We had felt this could be big if we succeeded, but we didn’t imagine that billions of people would be now using the open standards and the open software we created. The world is smaller than ever before. Friendships now span the globe. Internet technologies are reducing the need for travel for work, reducing fossil fuel consumption and pollution. Internet was originally designed to connect a few academic institutions, namely universities and research labs. Academia is a community of academics, which has always been based on the openness of information. Perhaps the most important to the history of the Internet is the hacker community composed of computer scientists, administrators, and programmers, most of whom are not affiliated with academia directly but are employed by companies and institutions. Whenever there is a community, its members are much more likely to volunteer time and resources to it. It was these communities that created websites, wrote the software and started providing internet services. The skills of the hacker community are highly sought after and compensated well, and hackers can afford to dedicate their spare time to the community. Society is funding universities and institutes who employ scholars. Within the academic community, the compensation is through citation, while plagiarism or falsification can destroy someone’s career. Institutions and communities have enforced these rules both formally and informally through members’ desire to maintain and grow their standing within the community. The values of academic community can be sustained within universities, but are not adequate outside of it. When businesses and general public joined the internet, many of the internet technologies and services were overwhelmed with the newcomers who didn’t share their values and were not members of the community. In the beginning, there was very little unwanted email, or spam, on the Internet. But once America Online and other service providers started bringing hordes of new Internet users starting around 1996, spam started growing. It was spam that brought down the USENET forums and made decentralized email clients almost unusable. Many companies are still being held hostage with the denial of service attacks on their servers. False information is distracting people with untrue or irrelevant conspiracy theories, ineffective medical treatments, while facilitating terrorist organization recruiting and propaganda. The excessively idealistic assumptions have actually made reality worse for Internet users. Fighting spam led to commercialization of the Internet, and excessive centralization of control and information. Large web media companies like Google, Amazon and Microsoft have been able to detect spam by creating highly centralized systems. Their services are highly popular, and the companies are liked by the general public. But as a result, a small number of companies have control of an unprecedented amount of personal information. These companies have access to what we search for, what we post about, what we email, who we message, where we go, who we go with, who we call, what we search for, what websites we view. A small group of conspiring individuals within these companies or an outside hacker can access all this data. Such break-ins have happened several times before (*,*,*). Even without a break-in, these companies are already accessing this data right now by themselves and potentially using it in ways we cannot even detect. Privacy laws do not protect us: it’s impossible to detect violations when private data is stored with these companies. These web media companies generate profits using our data. Their business model is facilitating advertising. Advertisers working with web media companies can target us by bidding on our gender, our age, or location or even our personal identity. These web media companies control the operating systems of our phones, computers, the web browsers we use to do banking and communication. They can activate a microphone or camera at any time by pushing an update to the software. We seem to be perfectly okay with the companies already using the data for profit, by performing data analysis about us, and choosing what version of an ad is most likely going to compel us to buy something we don’t need while interrupting the communication, research or entertainment we’re engaged in. They are beginning to use our data to train the artificial intelligence, thus using the value of our information and applying it elsewhere. As long as the public has trust in these companies, the amount of information and data will grow. It’s like a balloon that’s being inflated with data. It’s precarious: it takes a single needle to pop a balloon. Of course, once the break-in happens, people won’t trust the companies anymore. But there’s so much information there that even a single event can be highly lucrative. It’s irresponsible of these companies not to protect the private information in case of an attack on their systems. We shouldn’t expect much: the appropriation of user data is at the core for many of these companies. For example, the founder of Facebook hacked into protected areas of Harvard’s computer network and copied private dormitory students’ images. He then used them to create a website where users ranked two students based on their hotness (*). The situation is becoming even more dangerous because we are trusting these companies to offer us search results without a bias and documents without tampering. If the power of the internet consumer companies continues to grow, nobody will even know the balloon popped. There’s already evidence that internet consumer companies are becoming involved in politics by tampering with search results (*), buying media companies (*) and sponsoring politicians (*,*). So, when the balloon pops, there will perhaps be no news posts and no search results about it. Web media companies have earned hundreds of billions of dollars by extracting value from personal and protected data As a result of the internet development over the past 20 years, the average level of content online has been lowered, many publishers have gone out of business, and we’ve got more advertising than ever. The magazine industry has shrunk by 20% just between 2005 and 2011. The number of newsroom employees has fallen by 40%. We do, however, have web media companies earning valuations measured in hundreds of billions of dollars. Web media companies earned this in large part by matching advertising with the content either taken from the media companies or created by unpaid volunteers, while only returning a tiny fraction of that money to those who created the content. How did this happen? Above I’ve described how web media companies accumulate and extract value from our personal data. Many of these practices have actually developed earlier, with the public internet. It was the volunteers, webmasters, who have created the first websites. Websites made information easily accessible. The website was property and a brand, vouching for the reputation of the content and data there. Users bookmarked those websites they liked so that they could revisit them later — or emailed the creators of websites with suggestions and comments. Some of the websites primarily collected links to other websites and kept the links current and curated. In those days, I kept current about the developments in the field by following newsgroups and regularly visiting key websites that curated the information on a particular topic. Google entered the picture by downloading all of Internet and indexing it. It was a Faustian bargain for the webmasters: if they prevented Google from crawling and using the data, their websites could languish in obscurity. But if they did allow Google to crawl, they’d also allow Google to make a copy of the pages and using the information in there for Google’s own profit. Something else happened too: the perceived credit for finding information went to Google and no longer to the creators of the websites. After a few years of maintaining my website, I was no longer receiving much appreciation for this work, so I have given up maintaining the pages on my website and curating links. This must have happened around 2005. An increasing number of Wikipedia editors are giving up their unpaid efforts to maintain quality in the fight with vandalism or content spam (*,*). On the other hand, marketers continue to have an incentive to put information online that would lead to sales. As a result of depriving contributors to the open web with brand and credit, search results on Google tend to be of worse quality. When Internet search was gradually taking over from websites, there was one area where a writer’s personal property and personal brand were still protected: blogging. While search yielded results on a particular topic, one could stay current by following blogs on topics of interest. RSS reader software provided a way to maintain subscriptions or bookmarks to blogs. The community connected through the comments on blog posts. The bloggers were known and personally subscribed to. Alas, whenever there’s an unprotected resource online, some startup will move in and harvest it. Social media tools simplified link sharing. Thus, an “influencer” could easily post a link to an article written by someone else within their own social media feed. The conversation was removed from the blog post and instead developed in the influencer’s feed. As a result, carefully written articles have become a mere resource for influencers. As a result, the number of new blogs has been falling. Social media companies like Twitter and Facebook reduced barriers to entry by making so easy to refer to others’ content so much that the pool of influencers was a simple rich-get-richer phenomenon: famous personalities from mainstream media also became the most followed personalities on the social media. Social media companies then used the social relationships and communities and started inserting their own advertising. This way, even social media has started withering. Part of the rise of podcasting is the inability of social media to interfere with podcast subscriptions through special apps (*,*). But it’s a just a question of time when podcasting will get aggregated. How advertising fails as a business model for journalism? To earn an income with free content, publishers sold advertising space for banner ads. Ad tech companies like DoubleClick (later acquired by Google) sold ad space on behalf of publishers in exchange for a cut of the revenue. Because of the lack of competition in ad tech the revenue share continues to be unfavorable for publishers. Moreover, abundant advertising fraud led to over $7B in revenue going to fraudsters rather than to publishers (*). As a result, web advertising is hardly lucrative: the revenue that can be generated with web page advertising is measured in mere cents per hour, whereas subscription revenue from newspapers and magazines was easily measured in dollars per hour. At the same time, the online content is fundamentally unprotected through conventional copyright. The creation of print content and photographs, the collection of links to other relevant pages end up being a resource that gets harvested by search engines, social media, and content farms who end up extracting most of the financial value. For example, a search engine will extract the title and the summary, and reuse them in their page with search results — but the publisher will not partake in lucrative ad revenue displayed on the search result page. Social media will similarly repurpose the photos, headlines, and summaries to create an attractive news feed, and similarly, won’t share the lucrative targeted ad revenue with the creators of those. A content farm will re-use the hard work of journalistic reporting by creating a derivative article for a fraction of the cost — which can be published only minutes or even seconds after the original publication. To increase revenues in such an environment, publishers have made the advertising increasingly obstructive, eroding the privacy with tracking, slowing down page loading, increasing the amount of data consumed as well as shortening the battery life. This led more and more users to employ tools such as ad blockers (*), ad-blocking browsers (*,*), and offline reading apps (*,*). These tools strip content of ads and thereby publishers of revenue. Google’s Chrome browser is planning to start blocking ads (presumably non-Google ones, further consolidating their already dominant market share) in 2018 under the pretense of “usability” (*). Google and Facebook engage in censorship under the pretense of fighting “fake news” (*,*), although better proposals exist (*). The success of paid content business models and continued erosion of digital advertising. I’ve recently realized I read web content less and less, and read eBooks more. It’s true that web articles are often shorter and convenient, but I find I save a lot of time by reading well-researched and well-written ebooks from reputable publishers. It’s not even necessary to pay a lot to purchase ebooks — one can just loan or rent them from public libraries and online stores that support lending. Public libraries have spent over 6% of their total materials spending on ebooks. Why are ebooks better than web articles? Ebooks have a better business model than web pages: when an ebook is sold or lent, writers and publishers earn income. The income allows writers to do quality research and writing. Income also allows publishers to do quality selection, editing, design and distribution. Income is especially important at a time when publishing quality content on the web is increasingly about volunteering rather than about livelihood, and livelihood is about satisfying advertisers or, more recently sponsors. The sponsored content or native advertising model is about presenting advertising as content, so that readers think they’re reading an article when in reality they’re reading an advertorial. The web media firms that have successfully charged for content are worth considerably more. Financial Times has been sold for $1.3B to Nikkei, having the circulation of 1.3M. The Economist has been valued to $1.5 billion through the sale of Pearson’s stake, with a similar figure of 1.3M subscribers, and reaching 11M digitally. These publications are thus worth $1K per paid subscriber. On the other hand, newspapers that aren’t restricting access to their content are worth considerably less per customer: The Washington Post sold for $250M with the paid circulation of about 400K, even if the digital reach is 76M. The Boston Globe and its affiliated New England media assets sold for only $70 million with the reach of 571K. Paid business models are technically expensive to implement for smaller newspapers. But even more importantly, the management fears that increasing the price will drive down the number of readers, who have been spoiled with free content. Thus, while Financial Times and The Economist picked the path of staying financially independent from advertisers, most American newspapers and newspapers like The Guardian chose larger audiences, while continuing to shrink and cut costs. The give-away of content by national newspapers has led to the vanishing of many blogs, smaller newspapers, and magazines. Now even these national newspapers are threatened. They have hoped that growing digital audiences would lead to growing ad revenues, using the model of renting space alongside the articles to digital ad networks. However, consolidated digital advertising networks like Facebook and Google are a strong adversary. These networks are inviting newspapers to syndicate their content to Google search results and Facebook news feeds in exchange for a fraction of the ad revenue. In the meantime, Google and Facebook can play the game of favorites, and hold all the customer data. How content gets devalued by using Internet as a promotional tool. Perhaps the most dramatic downfall of a content industry has happened to music. Between 1996 and 2014, 75% of global music revenue evaporated, going from $60B to $15B (*). The annual revenue per capita in the US dropped 67% to $26 between 1999 and 2014 (*). The number of full-time music artists dropped by 42% between 2015 and 2000 in the US (*). An average American still spends more than 4 hours per day listening to music: this amounts to less than $0.02/hour of music, and only a fraction of that actually goes to its creator. The fastest growing revenue source for music is digital streaming. The business model for digital streaming is still based on the radio which paid a relatively insignificant amount in exchange for creating exposure to music. However, digital streaming offers millions of channels instead of maybe a dozen that existed when the business model was created. With old radio, one had no choice what to listen to, and had to buy the album to be able to listen to a song arbitrarily. But digital streaming services offer this ability while still only paying the artist the amount a radio station would. Several artists have opted out of streaming services (*), even though it’s difficult to do so (*). Independent musicians are furthermore in a disadvantageous position and receiving as much as 10x times less money per play than large music publishers — who often hold ownership stakes of digital music streaming services. Yet in the big scheme of things, digital streaming music companies are not alone at fault for the downfall of the music industry. They are still trying to charge for access to music under an all-you-can-eat subscription model while giving away some content for free combined with some advertising. The real problem is the ad supported model: if a website or an app offers any piece of music for free with some optional advertising to everyone in unlimited quantities — it’s very hard to persuade customers to purchase it. With human nature as it is, customers are eager to look for the cheapest option. And the epitome of the cheapest option these days happens to be YouTube. YouTube has over a billion users watching millions of hours of video per day (*), and generated over $4B in ad revenue just in 2015 — but has paid only about $2B to rights holders in the decade from 2007 until July 2016. The most popular YouTube search term is “music”. The revenue is only a small part of the value generated for Google: there are goodwill and generated data. Goodwill is the brand value generated for YouTube by giving content away is another part of the profit for the company, and that doesn’t get measured in the revenue share calculations. The generated data allows Google to create detailed viewing profiles for users that allow them to optimize ads. YouTube is free, while at the same time, people are perfectly happy to pay for a drink, a meal, a cab ride or a vacation. The primary ways of monetizing content these days is the subscription model. How does that work? A subscriber pays a fixed fee every month and received unlimited access to the content. Examples of this are Netflix for video and Spotify for music. It’s a bit like an all-you-can-eat buffet: a fixed payment for an unlimited quantity of food. It’s seemingly attractive, but to make it work, there is a small number of high-quality items and a large amount of inexpensive filler content. Netflix provides a trial account as the high-quality video is still scarce online, but Spotify has to compete with YouTube by providing a free ad-supported tier. As long as YouTube can freely provide content, only a minority of the potential market will be willing to pay extra. Why would a student pay $10 for an album if they can get unlimited Spotify subscription for less than $5 per month? Yet another consideration for the holder of content rights: they only have a limited amount of information what’s happening with their content, the information is delayed and it’s difficult to trust and audit what they do get. The news websites have tried the “metered model” — where the ad-supported tier only carries a limited number of articles that can be read. Maybe such a model will also appear in music. But the fundamental problem is that articles are still fundamentally treated as “free”, and that the news media continue to value their editorial role even though the editorial role has largely been transferred to the social media “curators” who make use of inexpensive raw material of articles. Subscriptions have been seen as the solution for content monetization online. Yet, at the same time, all-you-can-eat restaurants are a tiny minority of all restaurants. Subscriptions will not include top content without additional payment. The selection of what is free and what isn’t will be intrinsically subjective and expensive to negotiate. In the meantime, as long as a large variety of content is available free of charge. Wide accessibility of a large quantity of content on Spotify makes it difficult for bands and labels to offer digital downloads of their music. Already, Apple iTunes model of selling uniformly priced singles in addition to albums made it much cheaper to assemble an album composed of outstanding tracks. The subscription model is just the next step in this direction. The ad-supported model is a jump to zero. This price competition is leading the industry in a downward spiral which ultimately reduces the creativity. How some companies benefit from the rhetoric of “free” content, and how the hopes of content creators aren’t materializing. With the Internet, both barriers went down: the fragmentation of digital jurisdictions among hundreds of geographies, and judicial and law enforcement’s lack of technical ability led to the copyright laws being violated on a regular basis. The ease of copying or modifications removes the investment and delay that previously existed for physical carriers. Finally, web media companies have successfully lobbied against revamping laws that would limit or prevent effective enforcement of copyright (*) even though that is technically feasible, while passive aggressively making it difficult to use (*,*). So, at the moment, DMCA framework from the dark ages of the Internet (1998) remains as it is, with all the limitations (*,*). Whoever pretends to “liberate” content in this system, gets to play the role of a seeming Robin Hood and gets the credit, attention, and resources. Those facilitating illegal piracy became extremely wealthy, like Kim Dotcom (*), or politically powerful, like Pirate Bay founder Peter Sunde (*). In some cases, companies that violate copyright particularly egregiously, such as the music piracy pioneer Napster (*) or Kim Dotcom’s MegaUpload (*) do get shut down. But there are few personal repercussions for the agents: Napster co-founder Sean Parker later helped start Facebook as its founding president — and is now a billionaire (*). There’s a distinct disunity among creators on the role of copyright. Those creating are also consuming, and consuming more than most others, so having free access is quite appealing. To justify this, they are very happy to also freely share their work with others, engaging in a personal gift economy. Creators often base their work on creations of others, remixing and drawing inspiration from it, but rigid licensing practices make it difficult to obtain the formal permissions. Lack of transparency and one-sided contracts in the publishing industries create an alienation between creators and publishers. As a result, many creators are looking to revise the copyright laws, often by removing them altogether. However, rejection of creators’ rights is short-sighted. This change would primarily benefit intermediaries like Internet media and search companies. And these companies are the ones sponsoring think tank organizations and grassroots efforts that criticize copyright, and fund lobbyists that advocate limiting copyright. With these efforts and with the adoption of free content mindset, only advertising models are feasible. Creators have also been quite willing to offer free access to everyone as to get discovered and develop a following. It’s a strategy that worked quite well in the early days of the Internet when there was a strong community, a relative lack of content and still functioning avenues to sell content. But in the over 10 years that YouTube has existed, not a single best-selling album got launched on YouTube — and most artists still get discovered and launched through existing industry networks. A hope has been that free music would increase concert attendance. However, while $13B (in inflation-corrected dollars) of total recorded music revenue in the US vanished between 1999 and 2014, the live concert revenue only increased by $4.1B in this same period: to fill the gap, even tripling of current live concert revenue wouldn’t suffice (*,*). So, competition for attention by giving content away has only devalued music. Another hope has been that fans would donate. Yet, the only result is continued commercial failure of the donation model (*). When the music is perceived to be free, and when “sharing is caring” and 18% of American youth think it’s acceptable to upload content to pirate websites (*) — there simply isn’t any value attributed to the content, regardless of the effort that was put into it. When physical property is assured protection by the government — why shouldn’t intellectual property have the same? What makes a landlord more deserving of government’s protection of their investment and property than a scientist, a journalist or an artist? And why not transition from the model of apartment and property leases to voluntary donations to landlords by squatters? To summarize, with adoption of the Internet, the protection of content has weakened. It’s not that people aren’t willing to pay for good content: The success of iTunes, Netflix, Amazon and many other examples has already demonstrated that beyond all doubt. It’s that creators have bought into the deceptive optimism that giving away content will grow their audience. Moreover, the proprietary content e-commerce solutions have limited the traditional rights of content buyers — so content creators have been trying to compensate by giving content away. As a result, the value of content has been devalued, and it’s still hard to find an audience. It’s the content creators who are subsidizing this vicious cycle of content which is leading to an unprecedented shrinking of content creation industries. The importance of insisting on a price for content. It takes many years of study to be able to produce music. Then it takes a lot of work to create a good piece of work. Finally, it takes much effort and resources to establish recognition for a single or album, so that it can rise above the din of mediocrity and find its audience. After that, it costs virtually nothing to deliver the content through the Internet. The cost of content is not the cost of delivery, it’s the cost of creation. The creators hope to recoup the cost of creation by charging for delivery. It’s not too different for a farmer to acquire and clear the land, enrich it, select seeds, plant an apple tree, nurture it to maturity, and then protect it from pests. Once the apples are ripe, it’s very little work to pick them. But this ignores the vast amount of time and effort that needed to be put into those apples prior. Societies that don’t protect the farmers’ investment end up in poverty, as farmers stop working the land. This is beginning to happen to the Internet. The solution to this problem is the creation of a new type of rules for the protection of content creators. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights states (*): “Everyone has the right to the protection of the moral and material interests resulting from any scientific, literary or artistic production of which he is the author.” The US Constitution states (*): “The Congress shall have power […] To promote the progress of science and useful arts, by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries;“ Copyright has been developed at the beginning of the 18th century, became more widespread at the end of 19th century. These laws need a very significant update for the present-day internet. Moreover, to correct for the anomalies of the past two decades, content creators and the general public deserve a part of the value that has been unfairly captured by the web media companies. Publishers, authors, film production companies and many other owners of intellectual property are in a weak position compared with the concentration of Apple, Amazon, Google and a small number other consumer web media companies who control the commerce and rights protection technologies. These companies also spend enormous amounts of money for lobbying, Google spent $450M betwee 2015–2016 just in the EU (*). It’s only after the standards will truly protect the authors, creators and curators but also allow more openness and competition among the services based on content and data outside of public domain. What’s needed is a model governed by standards that allows content rightsholders to control and enforce the cost of acquiring a license to the content. The cost of that license needs to be clear and should hold for everyone, regardless of the business model, be it advertising or acquisition. With this, media companies can develop new innovative offerings to the users, while the clearly priced licenses ensure that the competition is in the quality of offerings and not through content deals. The dream of the universal internet library will then be fulfilled, where any piece of work is accessible for a fair price, without illogical bundles and barriers. 3. Failing to Protect Content The obsolescence of copyright with advancing technology. In the past, content was packaged into books and videotapes, later DVDs. It was physical objects, the “carriers”, that were bought and sold, even though the value was in the content itself. Carriers could be distributed, sold by a variety of competing vendors in different stores. The scarcity of carriers and the protection of copyright law ensured that the access to content was priced and valued. In addition to copyright, the delay and considerable investment needed for production and distribution of an illicit carrier protected the underlying content. Physical media were very difficult to copy, magnetic media such as audio cassettes simplified copying, but the quality of the copy was lower, but with the transition to digital media, copy is perfect. The content industry tried to develop digital copy protection and digital rights management (DRM) technologies. While they do prevent casual sharing to some extent, they also prevent behaviors that people were used to with physical media, such as the creation of permanent private libraries, creation of backup copies, lending to friends, ability to use different devices to consume content. DRM is only applied to commercial content, but fails to protect our personal data and many other types of content and data. But the most important flaw of DRM is that it’s fundamentally inadequate: the protection can always be broken, and the bootleg copy uploaded to the internet. The unintended effects of digital rights management technologies. Media companies understood that with digital technologies, digital content can be copied more easily than ever before. They sought protection for their digital content products through DRM technologies. Implementing a DRM system is difficult: it requires low-level integration with the operating system, the ability to offer a positive buying experience to end consumers, as well as the business ability to maintain partnerships with content rightsholders. As a result, few companies had the resources to develop DRM: Apple, Amazon, Google, Adobe and Microsoft. These companies were in a powerful position and they tried to leverage that. For example, when ebooks were a novelty, I bought a Kindle to read them. To get an ebook, I’d have to use a computer to buy it from a website. Kindle allowed the books to be transferred wirelessly. Before that, an ebook would be transferred to the reader with a USB cable: a complex feat for many people, requiring special software to run on the computer. That was the time of Kindle and Nook that only large companies can accomplish: it required 1) building a hardware device 2) creating custom software 3) acquiring the content from a number of publishers 4) launching and supporting millions of customers. It took an Apple to release the iPhone. It took a Microsoft to release Windows. It took Barnes & Noble to release Nook, and Amazon to develop the Kindle. Adobe and Microsoft tried to develop general-purpose technologies that were to be used by other stores. This is a harder problem, and Adobe’s ebook DRM technology has proven not to be very user friendly. Consequently, 75% of all the ebook sales now happen just through one company, Amazon. Amazon does not have to support open standards (*): a customer can’t read the purchased book on a device or with software that isn’t Amazon’s own (*). This limits innovation in e-book reading technology. Unlike with paper books, it’s very difficult to legally share one’s library with others. All the purchases are locked into an Amazon account, at mercy of the company operating the service (*) — and Amazon can even arbitrarily remove purchases from customers’ libraries (*). It gets worse: Amazon controls the prices, the selection (*), and the reading experience, and is monitoring every individual page view of every reader. Amazon uses price as its main competitive advantage over other retailers and has a history of driving competitors out of business (*) through predatory pricing (*), which it can afford because of its size (*,*). Amazon has started reducing payments to authors based on monitoring of the e-book reading applications (*). Amazon even started its own publishing unit (*). Other publishers can buy ad space on Amazon to promote their products. But Amazon can feature their own books on the landing page, or include them in automated product recommendations. With the search data, they can prioritize what books to publish. Amazon’s leadership now controls important national news media (*) and is now expanding to education (*). Ironically, judicial system perceived Amazon as an underdog when publishers tried to develop an agency pricing model for ebooks (*). As a result of media companies quest for content protection, a very small number of technology companies have developed a commanding share of the paid media market: Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google. These companies are involved in politics and have a considerable amount of ability to affect pricing, presentation and access to content for hundreds of million of people. There are very few controls on what these companies can or cannot do, and with their growth and degradation of journalism, it is becoming increasingly difficult to monitor and regulate them. A better approach than DRM is needed. These days, I prefer to read ebooks on my smartphone or a standard tablet: the pages turn faster, and I don’t need to carry another device. In fact, over 80% of American cell phones sold today are smartphones. I’ve been using several different apps to read my books. Some of them are web applications which don’t even require an installation. Since an ebook is technically not much different than a saved web page, there’s no need for special ebook stores or store-brand reading devices. Ebooks have become an internet technology. It’s the time of Linux and Android, not Windows. There are much fewer barriers to entry for new publishers. The role of libraries in making content affordable and accessible. For those who can’t afford to buy ebooks, it’s now increasingly possible to borrow ebooks from public libraries for free. Libraries are transforming themselves away from warehousing paper into curators of publishing. Libraries protect the rights of publishers and authors, buying ebooks using funds provided by the public, by members and by donors — to make verified and high quality information available to children, students and others. A large part of humanity’s information, knowledge and entertainment aren’t yet easily available online. There are wonderful books only found in libraries, fascinating video materials and recording only found in archives, children’s cartoons only available on DVD, performances only accessible at rare and expensive metropolitan venues, lectures only happening at certain universities. Why are then these materials not accessible to anyone online? It’s not just that the digitalization of physical content into digital form costs money, but that tickets, tuition, physical books help pay for the creation of these materials. In fact, the creators of these materials have a justified fear that once the content will be digitized, unlawful copying or piracy will deprive them of most of their income, just as it has happened to music. When it does become available, it’s usually available for a limited period of time from a single source. This model of licensing is very similar to the broadcast model, where the buyer of the license pays a fixed amount in advance. Such licensing deals tend to be viable only for a limited selection of works that are extensively promoted. At would be unaffordable for a comprehensive library of content to be created using broadcast licensing. In summary, more content will be available when protection and licensing practices are updated for the Internet era. Instead of trying to maintain practices from the publishing and broadcasting industries, a new paradigm of data licenses needs to be developed. Data doesn’t stand alone, but it depends on what is known about it, its reputation, quality, origin. In that respect, the next chapter will examine the role of the middleman. 4. Protecting the Middleman How products get developed and discovered? Creators put their love and care into producing something of quality, be it a book, a song, a film, or a physical product. We celebrate creators for their individual achievements, but in reality, creators don’t get very far without a team. A prerequisite for a quality product is training the creator, helping them develop the skills. Then, the creator needs collaborators and funding to create a high quality product. And finally, the product needs to be checked, certified, introduced to the public, and then distributed. This last stage is often dismissed as marketing, but it’s exceedingly important. In fact, the distribution of the product itself is itself a part of creation. While the creator is intimately familiar with the product and its qualities, a customer initially knows nothing about it. The task for the curator is to create a bridge between the customer and products. Customers have their own motivations, problems and interests. A curator seeks to understand the customers’ state of mind, and present the available products so that their value is clear to the customer, and present them in a way that allows the customer to explore and select. Moreover, the curator seeks to protect the customer from low quality and high price. Finally, curator retains a long-term relationship with the customer, as it’s rare for a customer to maintain strong relationships with every individual product’s creator. The job of storekeeper or merchant includes the work of a curator. Running the business of a store also requires procuring, storing, displaying, and protecting the merchandise, handling accounting, taking payments, and managing complaints, returns and refunds. With all this complexity, the curatorial role can easily be neglected: we’ve often found a store assistant that knew little about the products he was selling. Amazon does not have to create a pleasant environment of a bookstore and doesn’t employ staff to provide guidance to the bookstore customers. Amazon doesn’t have to display products and let customers try new products. But Amazon benefits from brick-and-mortar stores doing that. A buyer can be enjoying the curated selections in a physical store. Once the customer discovers a product, they can go to Amazon and search for the product they already know. With Amazon’s scale, it’s hard for most curators or brick-and-mortar retailers to compete with on cost. This practice is referred to as showrooming. Indeed, a store is a mix between a warehouse and a showroom or a gallery. Customers can explore products, ask the store employees for recommendations. If there’s a problem with the product, the store provides assurance and returns. It’s expensive to provide recommendations and allow a customer to explore the products. When stores do not provide such service, the publisher needs to market the products by broadcasting. While this isn’t a problem for consumer products like toothpaste, it’s a much more significant problem with small-volume products like books and fashion. That’s why stores provide an important role in discovery. They have a similar role as museums, as they create curated collections of products. Tourists travel far to spend time visiting shopping districts filled with boutiques. On the other hand, online stores like Amazon are the equivalent of a warehouse: it’s hard to discover anything new unless you know exactly what you’re looking for. Amazon and iTunes provide a user interface that has changed very little from the 1916 self-service store patent by Clarence Saunders. Saunders’ patent proposed that the customers walk through a store, collecting products for purchase from the shelves and putting them into the cart, paying at the checkout. Various devices, like one-way turnstiles, prevented thievery. Before that, a customer would order an item from a shopkeeper on the other side of a counter. This concept was quickly imitated across the industry. Online retailers are encouraging showrooming and attempting to steal the efforts of curators, giving them no recognition or compensation. For example, Amazon introduced the Amazon Shopping App in 2011. A customer can use this app to scan the bar code on the product, and buy it for a lower price from Amazon online (*). The store had to pay to attract the customer, stock the products, let customers browse in a pleasant environment, working to match the products to the customer. The store is now deprived of income, and the local community is deprived of sales tax and later deprived from retail stores going out of business. Over the past two decades the circle of curators has shrunk. The number of bookstores has fallen from over 38,500 in 2004 to fewer than 25,000 in 2016, a 36% decrease (*). The number of independent record stores has fallen from over 3,300 in 2003 to under 1,600 in 2013, a 52% decrease (*). The number of movie tickets sold is predicted to fall from 1.6B in 2003 to 1.0B in 2016, a 36% decrease (*). As these curators are vanishing, the mass-marketed hits and best-seller lists are beginning to dominate sales. In the past, the curators used to enable the “middle class” of quality content. That content was not being mass marketed, but was still widely available through theaters, through reviews, and through stores. There, content was picked up by enthusiasts who then recommended it further and gave it enough distribution for the products to be financially viable. But now, much content is no longer as viable as it used to be (*,*). Big hits are becoming bigger than ever: in the summer of 2016 of the top 100 tracks spinning on Pandora, 20 belonged to Drake according to the Pandora Top Spins chart (*). Many retailers are responding to the problem of showrooming. They don’t want to carry products where they won’t offer the best price. They look to be the exclusive retailer for products, sometimes through custom products or through store brands. We can already see deals where certain movies or TV shows are only accessible through one of the stores. It’s a frustrating situation for consumers, who are sometimes forced to acquire a whole monthly subscription to just watch one show or listen to one album. With digital products, content is fundamentally the same regardless of the source — and it would be most sensible to fix the price and allow different retailers to instead compete on the quality of curation and delivery. In the meantime top tier manufacturers such as Apple are opening their own stores partly also in response to retailers’ falling ability to curate. Many publishers have tried this as well, but the results have been somewhat mixed. Digital marketing is expensive if the customer lifetime value is less than $100. While a publisher knows how to select and produce quality content, creating a bookstore environment is not their core competency. Moreover, retailers do not want help customers discover products just so that they would later be bought directly from the supplier directly. Some publishers take an effort to assure their impartiality with respect to all their retailers. The demise of the reviewer. A large part of curation of products is done by our friends. They purchase products and test them — and then recommend them to others. Early adopters, which Malcolm Gladwell refers to as “mavens” in his book “The Tipping Point“ can spend a lot of time and money on staying ahead of others in knowing what’s best. But these are acts of volunteerism, not paid professional work. Few people can afford to develop a true expertise on products. Professional reviewers of the heyday were employed by magazines and newspapers, who had the resources to systematically evaluate a wide selection of products, and create high-quality reviews. Internet has made it a lot easier for anyone to publish. While such reviews are cheap and plentiful, volunteer reviewers typically don’t have much expertise in the product or evaluation techniques. Professional reviewers’ work is also used by “review aggregators” such as Metacritic or Rotten Tomatoes without compensation to create aggregations which are then offered online to end-customers. Some of the largest review aggregators have no qualms about uncredited data theft (*). E-commerce companies like Amazon solicit product reviews from its customers, offering no compensation and deprofessionalizing reviewing. As a result, there is an increasing amount of unreliable and deceptive reviews (*) — and customers need to spend an increasing amount of time researching. The best-seller lists can be easily manipulated by large publishers who have the resources to simply purchase their own products. Social media “influencers” can leverage their following to solicit positive reviews, views and ratings to help boost their ratings. Because customers trust such lists and recommendations, an initial fake purchase will be followed by real purchases — so such manipulative actions can be highly profitable (*). Reviewing communities bring together enthusiasts and expert who collaborate to develop their expertise on a particular topic, just like academic and hacker communities. The community provides a reward for sharing, but also peer review which discourages fakery and deception in reviews. As a result of that combined with the attitude of giving reviews away to the general public, the websites that bring the communities together are attractive acquisition targets. A book reviewer community GoodReads, as well as the movie database IMDB have been acquired by Amazon (*,*). Thus, the reviewers who thought they volunteered their work to the community, have instead merely donated their work to the companies who hosted the communities. It was these companies who received the money from the acquirers without having to compensate the contributors. The work of the contributors and their social connections are now effectively owned by Amazon. Automation of recommendations. The internet media companies think reviews and reviewers will soon be replaced by artificial intelligence and recommender systems. Such automated recommendations use the data we voluntarily submit about what we like or dislike. For example, one who liked several action movies might be recommended other action movies. The technology was pioneered by Netflix who realized that marketing drives people to see heavily marketed recent blockbuster movies — but it was expensive for them to purchase such a large number of DVDs. So, Netflix seeks to persuade its customers through recommendations to instead order an older, cheaper movie that they would still like. This has proven very profitable for Netflix, and given it a key advantage over other DVD rental companies. When Amazon notices that we’re considering a particular product, it lists other products that were frequently bought alongside with it. For example, if you look at Tolstoy’s War and Peace product page on Amazon, you will be also suggested other Russian classics. Amazon’s goal is to increase the number of sales, while minimizing the human effort of curation. This automation seems convenient, but there are important problems. Quality curation is often about exposing a visitor to new experiences, so that they develop a broader perspective. On the other hand, recommender systems seem to draw an unsuspecting customer deeper and deeper onto the rabbit hole they might have crawled into. For example, someone who bought a right-wing political book was just recommended more right-wing books, and someone who has bought a left-wing book was recommended even more left-wing books, based on the research into Amazon’s product recommendations (*). This can lead do dangerous political polarization, creating a deep rift in society. Another problem with such product recommendations is that new products have not been bought by anyone yet. So, a manufacturer with a large marketing budget can pay people to buy the product and thus populate the recommendation systems. Somewhat ironically, Amazon also offers its suppliers an option to buy advertising on amazon.com (*). The digital advertising market is highly centralized with Google and Facebook controlling almost 50% of digital advertising dollars in the US in 2016 (*). But there’s no economic incentive for an early adopter or a discoverer of such a product to profit from helping to spread the good word for a quality product except through non-monetary reputation economy. This is hopefully not the end. There are solutions. As many other volunteers on the Internet, I’m dependent on emotional and material support to continue to do my work. There’s much funding available for fashionable stuff. But there are real problems that aren’t fashionable (yet!).

(Representatvie image: Reuters) Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers (KPCB), a leading American venture capital company, which made its early bets on companies such as Amazon, Google and Twitter among its vast portfolio, has stressed how immigration is important for job creation in the American technology sector. The Internet Trends 2017 report of KPCB authored by Mary Meeker also provided data points on the importance of immigration for the technology sector in the US. It stated how more than 50% of most highly valued private technology companies with valuation of more than $1 billion in the US were founded by first generation immigrants creating more than 48,000 jobs. It provides examples of Indian immigrants such as Apoorva Mehta of Instacart, K R Sridhar of Bloom Energy, Laks Srini of Zenefits, Ragy Thomas of Sprinklr, Dhiraj Rajaram of Mu Sigma and Jay Chaudhry of Zscaler. The report states that 60% of most highly valued tech companies in US were founded by first or second generations Americans which has provided employment for 1.5 million people. The report has cited the example of Steve Jobs, the founder of Apple who was a second generation Syrian or the Sergey Brin of Google who is a first generation Russian. In the case of Amazon, founder Jeff Bezos is a second generation Cuban. In Facebook, one of the co-founder, Edurado Saverin is a first generation Brazilian. Watch this also: It also makes a mention of Cognizant, the Nasdaq listed IT services company with a large employee base in India, whose founders – Francisco D’Souza and Kumar Mahadeva are of Indian and Sri Lankan origin respectively. The VC company’s report comes in the backdrop of the various protectionist measures adopted by the current US administration under President Donald Trump. The administration has now made it more cumbersome for Indian IT companies to apply for the H-1B visas while also enhancing the fee structure. No Comments.

Not only can you now get far more relevant contextual information about artists and their works, but taking virtual tours of galleries just got a lot more informative too. First off, if you search for artwork on Google, you'll now find the search results a lot more useful, as the system can now group artworks by artist, location, materials used and the period they were created in. In practice this means searching for certain works will be a lot more informative, like the example for Gustav Klimt below. You can zoom in to high resolution imagery from Google Arts & Culture and easily find where it is in person for you to go visit. But sometimes you really don't want to leave the house, which is where the second part comes in. Google has allowed you to use Street View to virtually walk around museums and galleries for some time, but the extra data is now available on your virtual stroll too. So not only will you see the artwork in its natural habitat, but you'll still have all the information about that work right there in the Maps screen. Video of Searching for art just got better. Where will you start?   Google says it used machine learning technology to scan the walls of museums and galleries all over the world to identify and categorise over 15,000 works of art. The technology is similar to what Google Photos uses to identify objects, places and people. While zooming across a gallery in your browser will never be the same as actually visiting in person, it's certainly handy when the works you want to see currently reside hundreds of miles away. And a friend of mine still uses Google Streetview to retrace a two hour walk back to his town when he's drunk and feeling nostalgic for home. With that in mind, it seems plausible that some people will be happy to skip the queues and see the art in a browser window.

The European Commission’s decision will come after a seven-year investigation into the world’s most popular internet search engine triggered by scores of complaints from both U.S. and European rivals. The EU competition authority accused Google in April 2015 of distorting internet search results to favour its shopping service, harming both rivals and consumers. The Commission and Google declined to comment. The U.S. company has in the past rejected the charges, saying that regulators ignored competition from online retailers Amazon and eBay Inc. Fines for companies found guilty of breaching EU antitrust rules can reach 10 percent of their global turnover, which in Google’s case could be about $9 billion of its 2016 turnover. Apart from the fine, the Commission will tell Google to stop its alleged anti-competitive practices but it is not clear what measures it will order the company to adopt to ensure that rivals get equal treatment in internet shopping results. The regulator could set out general principles or specific instructions for Google to follow, said an observer. The Commission’s tough line is in sharp contrast with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission which settled its own web search case with the company in 2013 by requiring Google to stop “scraping” reviews and other data from rival websites for its own products.Google made three unsuccessful attempts to settle the case with the previous European Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia in a bid to stave off a possible fine and a finding of wrongdoing. Almunia’s successor Margrethe Vestager, however, has shown no willingness to settle with Google. The company has also been charged with using its Android mobile operating system to squeeze out rivals and with blocking competitors in online search advertising related to its “AdSense for Search” platform.The platform allows Google to act as an intermediary for websites such as online retailers, telecoms operators or newspapers. The Commission has warned of massive fines in both cases.

The apps used infected Android phones to auto-click on ads, and the number of downloads makes this possibly the largest mobile ad fraud network Google has ever faced. The malware apps saw between 4.5 million and 18.5 million downloads, as security company Check Point reports. Check Point was able to report the troublemaking apps, and Google has since removed them from their official app store, Google Play. How It Works Some of the apps had been around for years, but all were consistently updated, meaning that this malware campaign was a resounding success up until now. Here are the full details from the company that cracked the case: “The malware, dubbed ‘Judy,’ is an auto-clicking adware which was found on 41 apps developed by a Korean company. The malware uses infected devices to generate large amounts of fraudulent clicks on advertisements, generating revenues for the perpetrators behind it. […] We also found several apps containing the malware, which were developed by other developers on Google Play. The connection between the two campaigns remains unclear, and it is possible that one borrowed code from the other, knowingly or unknowingly. The oldest app of the second campaign was last updated in April 2016, meaning that the malicious code hid for a long time on the Play store undetected. These apps also had a large amount of downloads between 4 and 18 million, meaning the total spread of the malware may have reached between 8.5 and 36.5 million users. Similar to previous malware which infiltrated Google Play, such as FalseGuide and Skinner, Judy relies on the communication with its Command and Control server (C&C) for its operation. After Check Point notified Google about this threat, the apps were swiftly removed from the Play store.” Avoiding Malware Apps The only way to be sure you’re safe is to opt for downloading only the most well-established professional apps. And given some of Uber’s brushes with the Apple Store’s ethical standards that have recently come to light, maybe even the established apps aren’t safe. A full list of the 41 malware apps involved in this incident is available over here, for those interested in finding out if their Android phone has been supporting ad scammers for the last few years. Hint: If ‘Judy’ is in the title of an app you downloaded, you’re in trouble. Tags: ad fraud, android, android security, apps, Google, Google Play, malware, security Did you like this article?

For the next few weeks drivers in a dozen camera-equipped cars will canvas the city, section by section, to collect imagery which will help improve their "underlying technology", Uber's head of maps Manik Gupta said. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link Mick Deery is one of several contractors who will be driving around Canberra over the next few weeks mapping suburbs for Uber. Photo: Sitthixay Ditthavong "From the street imagery that is captured, we can extract information which helps us improve core elements of the Uber rider and driver experience, such as ideal pick-up and drop-off points, better routes, and calculating more accurate ETAs," Mr Gupta - who is a former Google Mapping executive - said. "Examples of information we extract from imagery can include business names and addresses, locations, street names, and much more." Mr Gupta said the data would help make suggested pick-up points and arrival times more accurate for users, and give drivers better in-app navigation, faster routes and more accurate drop-off locations. "As maps have become more advanced, it may seem like we have all the information we need. But mapping for Uber purposes requires a more nuanced data set than what exists today," he said. Advertisement "For example, we don't need to know what ocean topography looks like, but we do need to be able to understand ideal pick-up and drop-off locations outside a building." Uber's current technology is based on Google Maps, which is inaccurate by about 1.5 metres due to drifting tectonic plates. Mr Gupta said the data Uber gathered would be kept in-house and would help them roll out new functionalities for their app, like UberPOOL and UberCOMMUTE. Those services would reward drivers who picked up passengers along their daily routes.  The company was not gathering data to help roll out driverless cars, a spokesman for Uber said. The company was trialling a fleet of self-driving cars in Tempe, Arizona, but took them off the road in March after one of the cars crashed.  Waymo, the Alphabet company formed from Google's self-driving project, also filed a lawsuit against Uber in February accusing a former engineer from taking intellectual property from Alphabet to his current company, Uber. Uber has already mapped Adelaide, Brisbane, the Gold Coast, Melbourne, Newcastle, Perth, Sunshine Coast, Sydney and Toowoomba. You can't request a ride in one of the mapping vehicles, as they're driven by an independent contractor along a set route. Mick Deery is one of the drivers and said he was keen to become an UberX driver after his stint in the mapping cars. "I don't mind driving and I was looking for full-time work Monday to Friday," he said. Canberra was the first Australian city to legalise ride-sharing in 2015.

Google’s chrome browser to start blocking annoying ads in 2018 Technology Friday 2 June 2017 - 2:47am A woman walks past a logo of Google at the Global Mobile Internet Conference (GMIC) 2015 in Beijing, China, Photo: Reuters/Kim Kyung-Hoon LOS ANGELES - Google has started to inform publishers that it will add an ad blocker to its Chrome browser next year that aims to only filter out the most annoying ads, the company confirmed Thursday. By giving publishers advance notice, Google hopes to get them to adapt less intrusive advertising formats. The company is also offering publishers affected by ad blockers another way to monetize their content. “t’s far too common that people encounter annoying, intrusive ads on the web—like the kind that blare music unexpectedly, or force you to wait 10 seconds before you can see the content on the page,” wrote Google ads and commerce SVP Sridhar Ramaswamy in a blog post Thursday. Read: In battle of digital assistants, Google heads to Apple turf “These frustrating experiences can lead some people to block all ads—taking a big toll on the content creators, journalists, web developers and videographers who depend on ads to fund their content creation. We believe online ads should be better.” Google plans to add its ad blocker to both the desktop and mobile versions of Chrome next year. However, unlike other ad blockers, Google’s goal isn’t to filter out all advertising. The software will instead remove advertising formats that have been deemed unacceptable by the Coalition for Better Ads, a trade group that counts tech companies like Google and Facebook, but also media companies like News Corp. and the Washington Post among its members. Some of these ad formats include auto-playing video ads with sound, pop-up ads and ads that take over more than 30 percent of a mobile screen. Read: Google embarrassed by Holocaust denial glitch Google also isn’t the only browser maker to enable ad blocking. Apple tweaked its Safari browser back in 2015 to allow iPhone users to install third-party ad blockers, many of which filter out advertising altogether. Google will now give publishers affected by these all-or-nothing ad blockers a new way to monetize their content: Publishers will be able to encourage users who have ad blockers installed to either disable them for their site, or get paid access through a new program called Google Contributor. Still, some criticize that Google may have a conflict of interest. The company’s ads run on 16.5 percent of all websites, according to data from W3Techs.com . Filtering out other ads arguably gives publishers an incentive to run more ads from Google’s ad network. What’s more, Chrome has in recent years become the most-used web browser, and is being used by 58 percent of all internet users, according to W3Counter.com.   Reuters Comment Now!

Google confirms it will block bad ads in Chrome, starting in early 2018 Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/06/01 3:35pm PDTJun 1, 2017 52 Plus 1 on G+ 273 Share on Facebook 79 Share on Twitter Total Shares404 Applications Google News About two months ago, the Wall Street Journal reported that Google would add an ad-blocking feature into the Chrome web browser. Similar to AdBlock Plus' default setting, Chrome would block ads deemed unacceptable (such as pop-ups, auto-playing video ads, etc). Google has now confirmed this, and shared further details about how it will work. In a post on the company's blog, Google announced that it is joining the Coalition for Better Ads, an industry group attempting to improve online ads. The group has developed the Better Ads Standards, a list of guidelines for desktop and mobile ads based on comprehensive research. Ads deemed unacceptable include pop-ups, auto-playing video ads with sound, large sticky ads, and other common formats. In the post, Google confirmed that Chrome will soon not show ads, including those served by Google, on websites not in compliance with the Better Ads Standards. The change will take effect in "early 2018." This is huge news, especially considering that Google serves more online ads than any company on Earth. Now that Chrome has approximately 60% of the desktop browser market share (and growing), sites will likely have no choice than to follow the guidelines.

Can get rid of those annoying app install ads when browsing on the phone! Corbin Davenport Yeah, I think those are included, since they stick to the top while scrolling. Mgamerz Great news, but I guarantee you there's going to be a shitstorm headed their way really quick. Corbin Davenport Oh for sure. Something something free market. bekifft This is huge. However if they don't address the issue of deceptive ads, it's still a big problem. Hopefully one day I can finally in good conscience stop installing ad blockers as simply a security measure to protect my users. Corbin Davenport I haven't looked through all of the standard's documentation, but I don't see anything about deceptive ads. But I agree, that should be addressed. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Using any download site is an exercise in frustration. "Which giant 'Download Here' button is the right one?! Oh, of course, it's the tiny text link buried between three of them." Santos Chavez Ugh, I hate those sites with a passion. They're part of the reason i vehemently block ads. Take your stupid large fake green buttons outta here, filths :3 Adriannacsmith Google is paying 97$ per hour! Work for few hours & have longer with friends and family! !dy164c: On tuesday I got a great new Land Rover Range Rover from having earned $8752 this last four weeks..

Gregory Will there be an option to block all ads without exceptions? Corbin Davenport Most likely not. Artem Russakovskii Sort of, but if you subscribe to sites running Funding Choices and use Contributor to buy an ad-free pass. Which is how it should be if you want to enjoy quality content from creators. Good ads and free if you don't. No ads and small fee if you do. Bimmer Ime or you can install an adblocker and enjoy no ads and no fee :) Tom Westrick And the sites you enjoy won't be able to sustain themselves... Nathan J Are they hurting now? Because that's what we have now. We have ad blockers, and we have ABP with its acceptable ads, but a lot of people turn it off. How about the sack on that guy, telling the main guy at AP to block ads on his own site? I'm a block-everything guy too, but I'm going to be seriously looking into this Funding Choices thing. I don't want my ad-free page views being wasted on just any old site, but sites I read daily, like AP and Neowin, I definitely want to see them get their cut. R Firestone ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ That would kill the internet and you would have to pay for everything. Ads are what make the internet free Gregory You know, they can always make money on others, not on me. Most people don't bother blocking ads, they simply don't care. Mark Curtis Yeah gimme free entertainment, but YOU foot the bill! David The internet was in fact a much *worse* place before ads became a thing. All the nice stuff you have access to now only exists because of ad revenue (email, YouTube, any and all social networking platforms) Toys Samurai He reminds me of some people whom I know -- always say they hate ads and would rather pay for it. But when the content provider actually asks for money, they don't open up their wallets. Jorgen Phillips This is the most hippocritical thing I think I have ever read. Toys Samurai Exactly. This very site he's reading would not even exist if everyone blocks ads. David That's not true, they could just use a different monetization model. Nathan J Hypocritical. You may be thinking of the hippocratic oath, where the famous phrase "do no harm" comes from. If only ads would pledge to do no harm... Nathan J There already is. That's what we have now. I mean, we have the no ad blocker option, which is default. Then you have Adblock Plus's default setting, which whitelists ads ABP considers to be not malicious. And that's what Google is doing. Then you have ABP with that feature turned off, or something like uBlock Origin, that just blocks all the ads indiscriminately. This is a future measure that is designed to be more tolerant than current "all or nothing" solutions, plus Google is an advertising business. So, there probably won't be. Eddy Nelson Lopez They profit from it, why would they do it? 😂😂 Corbin Davenport They won't profit from it if a majority of users have an ad blocker. Which is where things are headed right now. exadeci They can blocks ads from everyone except theirs and having the most popular browser they can sell the exclusivity to other ad agencies. Corbin Davenport "In the post, Google confirmed that Chrome will soon not show ads, including those served by Google, on websites not in compliance with the Better Ads Standards." exadeci Couldn't they just prevent bad ads on their platform?! Imparus The problem is how you serve them to the user. If you create a popup filled with Google ads, it would be bad ads even thought they are Google approved ads. exadeci Right but if they can detect it in Chrome why can't they use this to disable the ads on the website that abuses it? Sonny Bono I'm guessing it's a preventative measure, seeing how many people get virused through some popup ads that they don't realize are a pathway to malicious software. We certainly don't want another epidemic of ransomware. I find most of my service calls go to elderly people who have no idea what they're doing and get tons of malware/ransomware. One old lady I was working with a few weeks ago actually "called microsoft" per the directions on her browser and gave them her credit card number. It wasn't really microsoft. abqnm As long as it takes care of the shady JavaScript click event pop-unders and other such js deceptive ad techniques which are generally not able to be caught by ad-blockers. I would really love to be able to go back to having JavaScript enabled and blacklist only certain sites rather than have to keep it disabled and whitelist the majority of my internet experience. TW Does this mean my phone won't connect constantly start vibrating because of ads on legitimate sites? raazman I'm sorry you have to experience this is this day and age. AintaDamnThingFunny This!! I've always wondered how those got through Chrome's security. I mean, it's an obtrusive add that makes your phone vibrate, and all you can do is close out the browser. How the hell do those get through and how has Google not stopped this from happening? Imparus Because a website can access the vibrator API, this is useful in the example of facebook, where you can activate notification for the site, and not having to use their shitty app. TW Now I know what to call the thing I hate: Vibrator API BRO i prefer my phone silent, no notification sound or vibration, as i mostly use my pc with pushbullet mirroring Santos Chavez OMG I hate those types of ads! Especially when the ads that popup are so obstrusive I can't do anything but exit Chrome. Ugh! blindexecutioner Doesn't affect me much. I already block ads. Nathan J It's not meant to affect you or I or anyone else who knows what uBlock Origin is. Google Chrome is the most popular browser, so I imagine what it will affect is the 60% or however many people use Chrome, and all of a sudden they're blocking malicious ads. That will affect a lot. I suspect for you and I, we will probably be able to just disable Google's solution and use our own, and if Google blocks other ad blockers, there's always Chromium. AS The biggest annoyances for me are subscribe popovers and EU cookie warnings. Things like taboola and outbrain need to be aggressively blocked. Lateef Alabi-Oki I'll disable my ad blocker if this gets rid of malicious and egregious ads. Nexus Hexus I'm sure most of these "Bad ads" will be alternative media. Or aka "Whatever we don't agree with" boop It's not content that's blocked, but format. Sonny Bono Ironically, all the ads that I find bothersome are on google services themselves, such as YouTube, but I have a Chrome extension (ublock origin) that works to get rid of them. Santos Chavez I enjoy YouTube so much, I pay for YouTube Red, via the Google Play Music Family Plan . Haven't seen an ad, especially on mobile. for months, and I get unlimited music streaming and downloading, all of those features shared to 5 other users. Pretty neat. Gary But do they block those annoying as hell forced Google surveys? Lord Argyris "...Google confirmed that Chrome will soon not show ads, including those served by Google, on websites not in compliance with the Better Ads Standards." I'm going to guess they're including their own ads here to avoid anticompetitive suits from competing ad providers. If they just blocked the other ads and left their own (presumably compliant ads), they would be gaining an unfair advantage and could be seen to be leveraging their strength in the browser market to incentivize use of their own ad platform. I wondered about this in my comment on the previous AP article on the subject, and it seems Google has considered the matter as well. Santos Chavez Yeah, it's kinda neat; by doing it that way Google avoids all sorts of blames of being hypocrites while also setting the example for everyone. "THIS", they say, "is how ads should be done. Look, we're even doing them to our own; you should, too". Terra Remove the ads that play before a video and we got a deal. Small banners below the video? Ok. Playing a commercial before the content I actually want to see? That is old tv bullcrap and is annoying as hell, even more so than popups. Dennis Ulijn "But, but, but...

Weeks of speculation that Google planned to introduce its own ad blocker for Chrome led to today's official announcement, with Senior Vice President, Ads & Commerce Sridhar Ramaswamy outlining the company's reasoning to block all ads for publishers that don't get in line.  While acknowledging, "the vast majority of online content creators fund their work with advertising," Ramaswamy also noted that "annoying, intrusive ads" have led users to block advertisements altogether via extensions and other tools.   Google's approach is to encourage better advertisements that both publishers and visitors can live with. The search giant has joined the Coalition for Better Ads and will use its Better Ads Standards as a guideline for best advertising practices.   "In a dialogue with the Coalition and other industry groups, we plan to have Chrome stop showing ads (including those owned or served by Google) on websites that are not compliant with the Better Ads Standards starting in early 2018," Ramaswamy said.  What are bad ads? According to the Better Ads Standards, examples of bad desktop ads include pop ups, auto-playing video ads with sound, "presitial" ads with countdowns (ads that don't let you onto a page until a timer runs out) and large sticky ads.  On mobile, examples of offending ads include many of the same as well as ads with a density higher than 30%, full-screen scrollover ads and flashing animated ads. Google's ad blocker is said to work on both desktop and mobile devices. Google is giving publishers at least half a year months to ready themselves for the ad blocker tool roll out, according to sources speaking with the Wall Street Journal. The publication reports ad blocking will be on by default, and will stop all ads from appearing on websites that have too many that result in a negative user experience. Google is treating the new tool more like a filter than a proper ad blocker, the Wall Street Journal says.  Comply or... Google is also providing resources for publishers so they don't suddenly lose all their advertising (and associated revenue).  The company has published an Ad Experience Report to help website owners identify whether ads they serve violate the Better Ads Standards. Google provides examples with screenshots and videos of annoying ad experiences as well as a best practices guide for what constitutes acceptable ads.  Another tool Google is introducing is called Funding Choices. This lets publishers post a customized message to users coming to their site with an ad blocker turned on. Users will have the option to either allow ads or make a payment to bypass all ads. Transactions will be completed through another new tool called Google Contributor.  Funding Choices is already available in North America, the UK, Germany, Australia and New Zealand, Ramaswamy said, with a roll out in more countries planned for later this year.   It's no surprise Google is introducing this ad "filter" as it ensures some ads are served up rather than no ads at all.  However, there's sure to be push back as publishers rely on ad revenue in order to show their content for free. What's more, with Google the ultimate arbiter of good and bad ads, the search giant may be seen as wielding too much power – more so than it does now – in the online advertising game.  Best VPN services you can try right now Related news Plex adds live TV streaming to its box of tricks Here's how much we've spent in Apple's App Store since it launched The best cheap soundbar deals in June 2017 The best cheap Sonos deals in June 2017 See more Internet news Tech deals, prizes and latest news Get the best tech deals, reviews, product advice, competitions, unmissable tech news and more!

Starting early next year, Google's Chrome web browser will automatically block some of the most annoying and intrusive internet advertisements, including those that automatically play audio or prevent you from viewing a web page. Google is a member of the Coalition for Better Ads, which recently published guidelines to convince advertisers to stop using annoying ad formats. Google will design Chrome's ad blocker to filter out ads that don't meet those guidelines, the company announced on Thursday. "In dialogue with the Coalition and other industry groups, we plan to have Chrome stop showing ads (including those owned or served by Google) on websites that are not compliant with the Better Ads Standards starting in early 2018," Google Vice President of Ads & Commerce Sridhar Ramaswamy wrote in a blog post. Rumors of the blocker first surfaced last month. Related 32 Hidden Chrome Features That Will Make Your Life Easier 32 Hidden Chrome Features That Will Make Your Life Easier Ramaswamy didn't offer more details about how the ad blocker would work or whether users would be able to deactivate it, but he hinted that the new feature will be similar to how Chrome currently deals with other internet annoyances, like blocking pop-ups in new tabs. There are currently four types of desktop ads and eight types of mobile ads that the Coalition deems unacceptable and that Chrome will likely block, ranging from ads that cover more than 30 percent of a website to large "sticky" ads that remain covering a portion of the page even when a user scrolls through it. While it might seem counterintuitive that Google would move to block ads—no matter how annoying they are—from its own network in its own web browser, the company has concluded that doing so is the best way to curb the rise of third-party blockers that remove all ads, not just those that are intrusive. "These frustrating experiences can lead some people to block all ads—taking a big toll on the content creators, journalists, web developers and videographers who depend on ads to fund their content creation," Ramaswamy wrote.

Jasper HamillThe Sun June 2, 20172:03pm New Google HQ plans in London. Picture: HayesDavidson GOOGLE has filed plans for an incredible “groundscraper” headquarters in London’s King’s Cross. The massive building will feature a running track on the roof, basketball courts, an Olympic swimming pool and even “pause areas” to allow staff to relax. The tech giant has submitted an application for planning permission with Camden Council — 18 months after Google boss Larry Page reportedly tore up original plans because he felt they were too dull. It’s hoped construction of the 11-storey, 1 million square foot building will begin in 2018. Joe Borrett, director of real estate and construction at Google, said: “We are excited to be able to bring our London Googlers together in one campus, with a new purpose-built building that we’ve developed from the ground up. “Our offices and facilities play a key part in shaping the Google culture, which is one of the reasons we are known for being among the best places to work in the industry.” New Google HQ will be home to 7,000 employees. Picture: HayesDavidsonSource:Supplied More than 7,000 staff will occupy the new HQ, which is the first “wholly owned and designed Google building outside the United States”. Bjarke Ingels, founding partner at the Bjarke Ingels Group architecture firm, said: “Our design for the new Google Campus at King’s Cross is rooted in the local character of the area, taking advantage of the contextually defined building envelope while creating continuously cascading work environments that will connect Googlers across multiple floors. The new Google HQ will have market halls, auditoria and shops on the ground. . Picture: HayesDavidsonSource:Supplied “By opening up the ground floor and activating the roofscape, the light and airy workspaces are sandwiched between the terraced gardens on the roof — and market halls, auditoria and shops on the ground.” The building has been described as a “groundscraper” because it sprawls rather than soars into the sky. The tech giant’s headquarters in California is known as the Googleplex. Picture: HayesDavidsonSource:Supplied Google was named after a number called the Googol, which is written as the number 1 followed by 100 zeros. The tech giant’s headquarters in California is known as the Googleplex, which is also a very large number. It will be an 11 storey building in London.

Business Home LBoard COMMENT Religious dept ought to be more discerning in its duties Read More FMT BAHASA FMT BORNEO+ FMT VIDEO CONTRIBUTE NEWS HOME NATION OPINION WORLD LEISURE SPORTS BUSINESS ADVERTISE WITH US Google faces hefty EU fine in shopping case by August Reuters | June 2, 2017 The company has also been charged with using its Android mobile operating system to squeeze out rivals and with blocking competitors in online search advertising related to its "AdSense for Search" platform. BRUSSELS: EU antitrust regulators aim to slap a hefty fine on Alphabet unit Google over its shopping service before the summer break in August, two people familiar with the matter said, setting the stage for two other cases involving the U.S. company. The European Commission’s decision will come after a seven-year investigation into the world’s most popular internet search engine triggered by scores of complaints from both U.S. and European rivals. The EU competition authority accused Google in April 2015 of distorting internet search results to favour its shopping service, harming both rivals and consumers. The Commission and Google declined to comment. The U.S. company has in the past rejected the charges, saying that regulators ignored competition from online retailers Amazon and eBay Inc. Fines for companies found guilty of breaching EU antitrust rules can reach 10 percent of their global turnover, which in Google’s case could be about $9 billion of its 2016 turnover. Apart from the fine, the Commission will tell Google to stop its alleged anti-competitive practices but it is not clear what measures it will order the company to adopt to ensure that rivals get equal treatment in internet shopping results. The regulator could set out general principles or specific instructions for Google to follow, said an observer. The Commission’s tough line is in sharp contrast with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission which settled its own web search case with the company in 2013 by requiring Google to stop “scraping” reviews and other data from rival websites for its own products. Google made three unsuccessful attempts to settle the case with the previous European Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia in a bid to stave off a possible fine and a finding of wrongdoing. Almunia’s successor Margrethe Vestager, however, has shown no willingness to settle with Google. The company has also been charged with using its Android mobile operating system to squeeze out rivals and with blocking competitors in online search advertising related to its “AdSense for Search” platform. The platform allows Google to act as an intermediary for websites such as online retailers, telecoms operators or newspapers. The Commission has warned of massive fines in both cases.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Friday, 2 June 2017 | MYT 6:30 AM Apple said to ready Siri speaker in bid to rival Google, Amazon Apple's device will differ from Amazon.com Inc’s Echo (pic) and Alphabet Inc’s Google Home speakers by offering virtual surround sound technology and deep integration with Apple’s product lineup, said sources. — Reuters Apple Inc is already in your pocket, on your desk and underneath your television. Soon, a device embossed with “Designed by Apple in California” may be on your nightstand or kitchen counter as well.  The iPhone-maker has started manufacturing a long-in-the-works Siri-controlled smart speaker, according to people familiar with the matter. Apple could debut the speaker as soon as its annual developer conference in June, but the device will not be ready to ship until later in the year, the people said.  The device will differ from Amazon.com Inc’s Echo and Alphabet Inc’s Google Home speakers by offering virtual surround sound technology and deep integration with Apple’s product lineup, said the people, who requested anonymity to discuss products that aren’t yet public.  Introducing a speaker would serve two main purposes: providing a hub to automate appliances and lights via Apple’s HomeKit system, and establishing a bulwark inside the home to lock customers more tightly into Apple’s network of services. That would help combat the competitive threat from Google’s and Amazon’s connected speakers: the Home and Echo mostly don’t support services from Apple.  Without compatible hardware, users may be more likely to opt for the Echo or Home, and therefore use streaming music offerings such as Spotify, Amazon Prime Music or Google Play rather than Apple Music.  “This will be a platform for developing Apple’s services,” says Gene Munster, a co-founder of Loup Ventures and former Apple analyst.  Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller declined to comment.  Chief executive officer Tim Cook has emphasised Apple’s services businesses over the past 18 months as iPhone sales slowed. He expects service revenue to double by 2020 from last year’s US$24bil (RM102.92bil). A speaker may help keep customers loyal to service products such as Apple Music, a subscription music streaming offering that costs US$10 (RM43) per month. The speaker would likely be tucked into Apple’s “Other Products” category, which currently includes devices like the Apple Watch, Apple TV and AirPods. That set of products generated US$11bil (RM47.17bil) in sales last year.  Inventec Corp, the Taipei manufacturer that already makes the AirPod wireless headphones, will add the speaker to its Apple repertoire, the people said. Apple employees have been secretly testing the device in their homes for several months, they said. The Siri speaker reached an advanced prototype stage late last year, Bloomberg News reported at the time. An Inventec representative didn’t respond to a request for comment outside normal business hours in Taiwan.  This year’s developers conference will be the first since 2013 to introduce new hardware. Apple could announce updated iPad tablets at the conference, one of the people said. Apple last updated the 9.7in iPad Pro in March 2016 and hasn’t refreshed the larger 12.9in model since its November 2015 debut. Planned Mac updates will include refreshed versions of the MacBook and MacBook Pro with faster Intel Corp processors, Bloomberg News reported earlier this month.  Apple hopes that more advanced acoustics technology will give the speaker an edge over competitors, according to people with knowledge of the product’s development. Along with generating virtual surround sound, the speakers being tested are louder and reproduce sound more crisply than rival offerings, the people said. Apple has also considered including sensors that measure a room’s acoustics and automatically adjust audio levels during use, one of the people said.  Apple will also likely let third-party services build products for the speaker. Last year, Apple opened up Siri on the iPhone to the likes of Uber Technologies Inc and Facebook Inc, allowing a user to order a ride or send a WhatsApp message with a voice command.  The device will be a hub for Apple’s HomeKit home automation system, letting users control devices such as lights, door locks and window blinds. At present, an Apple TV or iPad is required to control that equipment from outside the home or automatically. The Echo and Google Home both support third-party services and smart home appliances.  Ahead of Apple’s launch, the competition has upgraded their speakers with support for making voice calls, while Amazon’s gained a touchscreen. Apple’s speaker won’t include such a screen, according to people who have seen the product.  An Apple-designed speaker with high-end sound quality that fits perfectly into the Apple ecosystem is a familiar pitch. In 2006, Apple unveiled the iPod Hi-Fi, a battery powered speaker designed to cast a shadow over the thriving iPod third-party accessory market. With its bulky size and high price point, the Hi-Fi flopped and was discontinued within 18 months of launching.  With Siri and a clear hole in its ecosystem, Apple is banking that its second try at a speaker product will do better. — Bloomberg Related Stories You May Be Interested Lyft releases first diversity report, showing edge over Uber UK campaigner takes on Facebook ‘dark ads’ during election Apple said to ready Siri speaker in bid to rival Google, Amazon Toyota uses open-source software in new approach to in-car tech How to avoid dehydration during Ramadan Racing for a better tomorrow Others Also Read Retailer donates furniture and products worth RM8,300 to four homes in Sabah and Sarawak Dutch striker Huntelaar rejoins Ajax on one-year deal Afghan police fire into air to disperse demonstrators in Kabul - witnesses advertisement Latest News Fretting over savings, Mrs Watanabe turns to bitcoin Lyft releases first diversity report, showing edge over Uber Patriotic Russians may have staged cyber attacks on own initiative Google faces hefty EU fine in shopping case by August: sources Waymo working on self-driving trucks Most Viewed in Tech Chipmakers at Taiwan's biggest tech fair look beyond crowded smartphone market Ethiopia cuts off Internet after high school exam leaks Patriotic Russians may have staged cyber attacks on own initiative Musk, Iger to quit Trump advisory councils after Paris accord decision Google faces hefty EU fine in shopping case by August: sources Sophisticated automatic replies are coming to Gmail Waymo working on self-driving trucks Lyft releases first diversity report, showing edge over Uber Parents have no right to dead child's Facebook account To play Android games on your PC, this is the best emulator Powered by advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)
Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Friday, 2 June 2017 | MYT 7:30 AM Alphabet’s driverless ambitions looked stalled. Then it sued Uber by mark bergenandkartikay mehrotra Only a few months ago, critics suggested Alphabet had squandered its head-start in driverless technology. But behind the scenes, Waymo was shoring up its engineering bench and improving the technology, and then it made a legal move on Uber and in one fell stroke separated a competitor from its star engineer. — Reuters Not so long ago Alphabet Inc’s self-driving ambitions seemed to have lost momentum despite the company being among the earliest to put experimental autonomous cars on the road.  There was no business plan, and Alphabet was in danger of losing its first-mover advantage to traditional automakers and Silicon Valley startups, including Uber Technologies Inc. It looked as though the company had started another moonshot.  Then Alphabet got serious.   Late last year, the company spun off the self-driving arm into its own entity, called Waymo, which this month began testing a driverless taxi service in Phoenix featuring minivans loaded with in-house technology. Waymo also pulled out a legal bazooka, suing Uber and accusing the ride-hailing company of stealing trade secrets when it acquired the autonomous vehicle startup founded by Anthony Levandowski, who previously helped run Google’s driverless arm.  On May 27, Uber fired Levandowski because he refused to turn over allegedly stolen documents to the court. In an instant, Waymo had separated a key rival from its star engineer.  Only a few months ago, critics suggested Alphabet had squandered its head-start in driverless technology. Waymo had lost several engineers – including its original tech lead, Chris Urmson, and several people recruited by Levandowski – and cut a deal with only one carmaker, Fiat Chrysler. The auto industry and a bevy of startups were aggressively working on driverless technology. Tesla Inc, meanwhile, was touting Autopilot.  But behind the scenes, Waymo was shoring up its engineering bench and improving the technology. Since being spun out of Alphabet’s X lab in December, the division has hired aggressively, including several engineers from Terra Bella, the satellite division Google sold earlier this year, according to a person familiar with the situation. Waymo also designed new hardware that helps vehicles see their surroundings better. Another auto manufacturing deal with Honda Motor Co is in the works, and earlier this month, Waymo announced a US partnership with Uber nemesis Lyft Inc.  Uber’s fortunes, meanwhile, have cratered. Executives have been leaving amid a broader culture crisis, ignited by claims of pervasive sexual harassment across the company. Former US Attorney General Eric Holder is expected to issue an internal report on this issue to the company this week. Among those who have left: Sherif Marakby, a high-profile hire from Detroit responsible for deals with carmakers at Uber’s self-driving unit. Earlier this month, he returned to Ford. Several other engineers from Uber’s self-driving programme have also recently left, defecting for autonomous companies started by former Uber and Waymo roboticists, according to their LinkedIn profiles.  While the first driverless cars aren’t expected on US highways for five to 10 years, the emerging industry is already hotly contested. Sidelining or at least hobbling Uber would give Waymo time to shore up its position. But Uber chief Travis Kalanick is a notoriously dogged competitor, who believes his company’s very survival depends on mastering driverless technology. Uber could partner with other companies to build the tech and already has a massive global driving network in place, a key attribute for collecting driverless data.  Meanwhile, the court battle is far from over. Firing Levandowski buttresses Uber’s case that it never had access to the trade secrets he allegedly downloaded before quitting Alphabet. Uber also says it developed the underlying lidar technology without Levandowski’s input. From a legal standpoint, Uber had little choice but to push Levandowski out. Doing so shows the company is complying with a court order and not trying to shield the executive accused of stealing thousands of documents.  The move also could presage some kind of legal settlement for Uber. There also remains a chance the case moves to criminal court; now that he’s no longer employed by and beholden to Uber, Levandowski could cooperate with prosecutors in exchange for immunity – a switch that could prove detrimental to Uber.  “The same way Waymo improved its position by getting Uber to cut Levandowski, Uber improved its position by distancing themselves from him,” says Jim Pooley, a Silicon Valley intellectual property lawyer who isn’t involved in the case. “This is all about risk reduction.” — Bloomberg Related Stories You May Be Interested Lyft releases first diversity report, showing edge over Uber UK campaigner takes on Facebook ‘dark ads’ during election Apple said to ready Siri speaker in bid to rival Google, Amazon Toyota uses open-source software in new approach to in-car tech How to avoid dehydration during Ramadan Racing for a better tomorrow Others Also Read Retailer donates furniture and products worth RM8,300 to four homes in Sabah and Sarawak Dutch striker Huntelaar rejoins Ajax on one-year deal Afghan police fire into air to disperse demonstrators in Kabul - witnesses advertisement Latest News Fretting over savings, Mrs Watanabe turns to bitcoin Lyft releases first diversity report, showing edge over Uber Patriotic Russians may have staged cyber attacks on own initiative Google faces hefty EU fine in shopping case by August: sources Waymo working on self-driving trucks Most Viewed in Tech Chipmakers at Taiwan's biggest tech fair look beyond crowded smartphone market Ethiopia cuts off Internet after high school exam leaks Patriotic Russians may have staged cyber attacks on own initiative Musk, Iger to quit Trump advisory councils after Paris accord decision Google faces hefty EU fine in shopping case by August: sources Sophisticated automatic replies are coming to Gmail Waymo working on self-driving trucks Lyft releases first diversity report, showing edge over Uber Parents have no right to dead child's Facebook account To play Android games on your PC, this is the best emulator Powered by advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

Media: Connor Letourneau / sfchronicle.com As the Warriors’ acting head coach, Mike Brown’s primary objective is to maintain the status quo. Because after seeing Golden State win at least 67 games in three straight seasons, he recognizes that Steve Kerr’s blueprint has worked. Before Game 1 of the NBA Finals on Thursday night, while trying to describe the team’s philosophy, he drew parallels to another popular Bay Area-based organization. “If your work environment is enjoyable, you’re going to bring that much more to the table,” Brown said. “It’s a way of thinking like, I guess, Google, maybe. Google has the big campus that’s like a playground. People love to go to work at Google. They know at lunch time they can go to the playground and jump on the jungle gym or something like that. It’s no different than the message that Steve wants to get across to our guys.” That the Warriors’ approach mimics Silicon Valley’s booming tech industry is no mistake. In 2010, after a group of venture capitalists bought Golden State, they started implementing ideologies that were foundational to their previous companies’ success. Among them was the notion that winning and having fun shouldn’t be mutually exclusive. Kerr, perhaps the league’s most laid-back head coach, has helped put that philosophy into action. Pranks between players are commonplace. To mock his team’s new public image as the NBA’s new evil empire, Kerr distributed T-shirts to his players during training camp that read “Super Villains.” Hip-hop music thumps through the loudspeakers at every practice. Since taking over for the ailing Kerr before Game 3 of the first round, Brown has made a point to keep up the Warriors’ easygoing environment. It is an underrated reason Golden State became the first team in NBA history to open a postseason 12-0.

Because at the end of the day, that’s what it is.” Connor Letourneau is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer. Email: cletourneau@sfchronicle.com.

Google confirms it will block bad ads in Chrome, starting in early 2018 Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/06/01 3:35pm PDTJun 1, 2017 52 Plus 1 on G+ 273 Share on Facebook 79 Share on Twitter Total Shares404 Applications Google News About two months ago, the Wall Street Journal reported that Google would add an ad-blocking feature into the Chrome web browser. Similar to AdBlock Plus' default setting, Chrome would block ads deemed unacceptable (such as pop-ups, auto-playing video ads, etc). Google has now confirmed this, and shared further details about how it will work. In a post on the company's blog, Google announced that it is joining the Coalition for Better Ads, an industry group attempting to improve online ads. The group has developed the Better Ads Standards, a list of guidelines for desktop and mobile ads based on comprehensive research. Ads deemed unacceptable include pop-ups, auto-playing video ads with sound, large sticky ads, and other common formats. In the post, Google confirmed that Chrome will soon not show ads, including those served by Google, on websites not in compliance with the Better Ads Standards. The change will take effect in "early 2018." This is huge news, especially considering that Google serves more online ads than any company on Earth. Now that Chrome has approximately 60% of the desktop browser market share (and growing), sites will likely have no choice than to follow the guidelines.

Mgamerz Great news, but I guarantee you there's going to be a shitstorm headed their way really quick. Corbin Davenport Oh for sure. Something something free market. bekifft This is huge. However if they don't address the issue of deceptive ads, it's still a big problem. Hopefully one day I can finally in good conscience stop installing ad blockers as simply a security measure to protect my users. Corbin Davenport I haven't looked through all of the standard's documentation, but I don't see anything about deceptive ads. But I agree, that should be addressed. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Using any download site is an exercise in frustration. "Which giant 'Download Here' button is the right one?! Oh, of course, it's the tiny text link buried between three of them." Santos Chavez Ugh, I hate those sites with a passion. They're part of the reason i vehemently block ads.

Gregory Will there be an option to block all ads without exceptions? Corbin Davenport Most likely not. Artem Russakovskii Sort of, but if you subscribe to sites running Funding Choices and use Contributor to buy an ad-free pass. Which is how it should be if you want to enjoy quality content from creators. Good ads and free if you don't. No ads and small fee if you do. Bimmer Ime or you can install an adblocker and enjoy no ads and no fee :) Tom Westrick And the sites you enjoy won't be able to sustain themselves... Nathan J Are they hurting now? Because that's what we have now. We have ad blockers, and we have ABP with its acceptable ads, but a lot of people turn it off. How about the sack on that guy, telling the main guy at AP to block ads on his own site? I'm a block-everything guy too, but I'm going to be seriously looking into this Funding Choices thing. I don't want my ad-free page views being wasted on just any old site, but sites I read daily, like AP and Neowin, I definitely want to see them get their cut. R Firestone ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ That would kill the internet and you would have to pay for everything. Ads are what make the internet free Gregory You know, they can always make money on others, not on me. Most people don't bother blocking ads, they simply don't care. Mark Curtis Yeah gimme free entertainment, but YOU foot the bill! David The internet was in fact a much *worse* place before ads became a thing. All the nice stuff you have access to now only exists because of ad revenue (email, YouTube, any and all social networking platforms) Toys Samurai He reminds me of some people whom I know -- always say they hate ads and would rather pay for it. But when the content provider actually asks for money, they don't open up their wallets. Jorgen Phillips This is the most hippocritical thing I think I have ever read. Toys Samurai Exactly. This very site he's reading would not even exist if everyone blocks ads. David That's not true, they could just use a different monetization model. Nathan J Hypocritical. You may be thinking of the hippocratic oath, where the famous phrase "do no harm" comes from. If only ads would pledge to do no harm... Nathan J There already is. That's what we have now. I mean, we have the no ad blocker option, which is default. Then you have Adblock Plus's default setting, which whitelists ads ABP considers to be not malicious. And that's what Google is doing. Then you have ABP with that feature turned off, or something like uBlock Origin, that just blocks all the ads indiscriminately. This is a future measure that is designed to be more tolerant than current "all or nothing" solutions, plus Google is an advertising business. So, there probably won't be. Eddy Nelson Lopez They profit from it, why would they do it? 😂😂 Corbin Davenport They won't profit from it if a majority of users have an ad blocker. Which is where things are headed right now. exadeci They can blocks ads from everyone except theirs and having the most popular browser they can sell the exclusivity to other ad agencies. Corbin Davenport "In the post, Google confirmed that Chrome will soon not show ads, including those served by Google, on websites not in compliance with the Better Ads Standards." exadeci Couldn't they just prevent bad ads on their platform?! Imparus The problem is how you serve them to the user. If you create a popup filled with Google ads, it would be bad ads even thought they are Google approved ads. exadeci Right but if they can detect it in Chrome why can't they use this to disable the ads on the website that abuses it? Sonny Bono I'm guessing it's a preventative measure, seeing how many people get virused through some popup ads that they don't realize are a pathway to malicious software. We certainly don't want another epidemic of ransomware. I find most of my service calls go to elderly people who have no idea what they're doing and get tons of malware/ransomware. One old lady I was working with a few weeks ago actually "called microsoft" per the directions on her browser and gave them her credit card number. It wasn't really microsoft. abqnm As long as it takes care of the shady JavaScript click event pop-unders and other such js deceptive ad techniques which are generally not able to be caught by ad-blockers. I would really love to be able to go back to having JavaScript enabled and blacklist only certain sites rather than have to keep it disabled and whitelist the majority of my internet experience. TW Does this mean my phone won't connect constantly start vibrating because of ads on legitimate sites? raazman I'm sorry you have to experience this is this day and age. AintaDamnThingFunny This!! I've always wondered how those got through Chrome's security. I mean, it's an obtrusive add that makes your phone vibrate, and all you can do is close out the browser. How the hell do those get through and how has Google not stopped this from happening? Imparus Because a website can access the vibrator API, this is useful in the example of facebook, where you can activate notification for the site, and not having to use their shitty app. TW Now I know what to call the thing I hate: Vibrator API BRO i prefer my phone silent, no notification sound or vibration, as i mostly use my pc with pushbullet mirroring Santos Chavez OMG I hate those types of ads! Especially when the ads that popup are so obstrusive I can't do anything but exit Chrome. Ugh! blindexecutioner Doesn't affect me much. I already block ads. Nathan J It's not meant to affect you or I or anyone else who knows what uBlock Origin is. Google Chrome is the most popular browser, so I imagine what it will affect is the 60% or however many people use Chrome, and all of a sudden they're blocking malicious ads. That will affect a lot. I suspect for you and I, we will probably be able to just disable Google's solution and use our own, and if Google blocks other ad blockers, there's always Chromium. AS The biggest annoyances for me are subscribe popovers and EU cookie warnings. Things like taboola and outbrain need to be aggressively blocked. Lateef Alabi-Oki I'll disable my ad blocker if this gets rid of malicious and egregious ads. Nexus Hexus I'm sure most of these "Bad ads" will be alternative media. Or aka "Whatever we don't agree with" boop It's not content that's blocked, but format. Sonny Bono Ironically, all the ads that I find bothersome are on google services themselves, such as YouTube, but I have a Chrome extension (ublock origin) that works to get rid of them. Santos Chavez I enjoy YouTube so much, I pay for YouTube Red, via the Google Play Music Family Plan . Haven't seen an ad, especially on mobile. for months, and I get unlimited music streaming and downloading, all of those features shared to 5 other users. Pretty neat. Gary But do they block those annoying as hell forced Google surveys? Lord Argyris "...Google confirmed that Chrome will soon not show ads, including those served by Google, on websites not in compliance with the Better Ads Standards." I'm going to guess they're including their own ads here to avoid anticompetitive suits from competing ad providers. If they just blocked the other ads and left their own (presumably compliant ads), they would be gaining an unfair advantage and could be seen to be leveraging their strength in the browser market to incentivize use of their own ad platform. I wondered about this in my comment on the previous AP article on the subject, and it seems Google has considered the matter as well. Santos Chavez Yeah, it's kinda neat; by doing it that way Google avoids all sorts of blames of being hypocrites while also setting the example for everyone. "THIS", they say, "is how ads should be done. Look, we're even doing them to our own; you should, too". Terra Remove the ads that play before a video and we got a deal. Small banners below the video? Ok. Playing a commercial before the content I actually want to see? That is old tv bullcrap and is annoying as hell, even more so than popups. Dennis Ulijn "But, but, but...

[Update: Site is live, more details] Google launches Funding Choices, a way for users to pay sites to hide ads Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/06/01 8:01pm PDTJun 1, 2017 35 Plus 1 on G+ 77 Share on Facebook 59 Share on Twitter Total Shares171 Games News Update 1: 2017/06/01 8:01pm PDT The new site for Google Contributor/Funding Choices is live, and offers some new insight into how the service actually works. According to the signup page, each page without ads You may recall Google Contributor, which was a service by Google that allowed users to pay a monthly contribution to see fewer ads online. Your money would directly substitute the money earned by the site for advertisements. Contributor was discontinued in late 2016, with Google saying that an improved version would become available in "early 2017." Today, the company launched Funding Choices, the successor to Contributor. Currently in beta, it allows sites to show a customized message to visitors using an ad blocker. The message asks users to either enable ads for the site, or pay for a pass through Contributor that removes all ads on that site. Unlike the original Contributor, Funding Choices hides more than just AdSense ads If you're reading this and thinking, "I really wish Android Police would do this," then you're in luck. We've been part of Google's internal beta, but we're not quite ready to roll it out. Just know that we are definitely working on it. The new Contributor site doesn't seem to be live yet, but there will likely be more details there soon. Source: Google Update 1: 2017/06/01 8:01pm PDT The new site for Google Contributor/Funding Choices is live, and offers some new insight into how the service actually works. According to the signup page, each page without ads that you view on a site costs a small amount, with publishers apparently able to change the price (most of them seem to use $0.01 per page right now). So assuming $0.01 per page, $1 gets you 100 pages without ads, and Google is offering a $5 pass to start out with. Not bad pricing at all, as long as sites stay around the $0.01 price point. Google also offers a list of sites supporting Google Contributor, which currently includes Beliefnet, Business Insider UK, ComicBook, Eurogamer, Grub Street, Hot Air, Parkers, Patheos, Popular Mechanics, Townhall, Twitchy, and World Wide Gaming.

NexusPhan The ads in AP are not bad. Very reasonable and not intrusive at all. I have this site whitelisted to help support their great work. You should consider it too before funding choices goes live. MJ There is certainly websites with much more obnoxious ads but their is a lot of ads on AP. It's just not an acceptable user experience and I not going to subject myself to it. I have been calling for a way to donate to AP for awhile now (why did AP have to wait for a Google solution?) so we see how this plays out. Alex Dueppen Unfortunately Disqus hasn't been the same way, it seems to often load ads that redirect you to those scam "You are winner" pages that try to look like facebook. Adriannacsmith Google is paying 97$ per hour! Work for few hours & have longer with friends and family! !dy164c: On tuesday I got a great new Land Rover Range Rover from having earned $8752 this last four weeks.. Its the most-financialy rewarding I've had.. Follow this link for more information !dy164c: ➽➽ ➽➽;➽➽ http://GoogleFinancialCashJobs454MarketDriveGetPaid$97/Hour... ★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫::::::!dy164c:....,..... NeverrKnowsBest I have gotten full screen malware ads from AP before. I did not want to block them, but they forced my hand. NexusPhan They did have a bad streak of ads for a while about a year ago. I remember that now that you say it. I enabled ad blocker for a few months after it happened. Corbin Davenport I will say that those are normally from Disqus, and we've worked with Disqus in the past to identify them and get them removed. ZettabyteGamer I'm sure it would be hard but if disqus is causing so many problems, maybe you should switch to a different comment section or make your own? Justin W I'd agree that AP's ads aren't bad, but Disqus's are terrible. Irwin LOL are you seriuos? on mobile, like half the site is all ads. It's ridiculous. blueman24 I'm ok with whitelist for sites like AP on desktop but on mobile, I don't want any ads. AP can add 5 more ads on their desktop site but don't cripple performance on my already slow phone. Rashad Would it be a one time cost or is this a cost each time we visit a participating site? Corbin Davenport I believe it's a monthly subscription, just like the previous Contributor. MJ Questions? Why did AP have to wait for a Google solution? There are many ways you could have been collecting money all this time. A automatic monthly subscription? Sounds like a loser already as people hate that. It's not going to be a set amount but like pick an amount right? An annual subscription would make more sense. Why can't there just be a simple donate button so people could send money when they can and just continuing blocking the ads ourselves like we have been already doing? Cai Copley It's that you do it in one, centralized location for such a subscription, and not doing it over a series of sites and forgetting how much you're spending. MJ I guess need more details on how it works... Jeff Beck We'll have a special rate for you MJ. .005 cents per article, $15 per grumpy comment submitted. We are going to make a fortune off you ;) George https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4ba5750c423a92daff44db461bb3042c433e0f5e7edc1f8dadcb32198db0d5e8.jpg Mark Curtis Or just block ads and not pay! I'm entitled to free content! gimme gimme gimme. faceless128 it's about safety. there are so many malicious advertisements out there. if a site doesn't directly control the ads that show up, how can they ensure our safety? Camerooni I use privacy badger.. if it blocks ads that play bad - I'm okay with that alongside blocking tracking cookies etc. What I don't like is sites assuming that if you're blocking an ad network that plays bad with you that you're the bad guy.. Things have to work both ways. Ailín Ó’S I wonder will this work internationally or just USA only because I use adblock and don't have AP (for example) whitelisted because of the sheer volume of ads on the site especially from the likes of Disqus with their "Congrats! You're a winner!" and "Local man makes 999.999€ a day with this trick!" spam. cadtek91 I'd imagine it would work with anyone with a Google account? Fabrice Thomas Seems like it's only available in these contries: US, Germany, New Zealand and UK https://support.google.com/contributor/answer/6182581?hl=en Jeff Beck If you want to just pay me directly I'll give you my PayPal address. That'll make things even easier on you. I know, I'm way too nice to you all, you're welcome. TechGuy22 Thanks but I'll stick adblock and adaway needa If you guys are wanting input, which I know you didn't ask for, five bucks a year would be my max. Not sure how it works, but I would want that on my mobile device. Desktop chrome has what I need in an extension. Ultimately that would earn more money from me, as i get on this sight far less with mobile chrome. Good_Ole_Pinocchio 5 bucks a year? What does that Pay for? Beer for the staff? needa If everyone that comes to this site with adblock paid five bucks, I doubt they would complain. Jeffrey Spiers Brave browser has this built into the browser directly, have used the feature on some of my most frequented sites. Switched to Brave due to many sites detecting and bitching about ad blockers recently. Good_Ole_Pinocchio Web Ads are trash, always. But I've never used ad blockers. Because if I'm taking the content, I'm taking the ads, or I just don't go to the site if the ads are really horrible. I'd more than pay for no ads. psy spy You have to sign in to your gmail account for this to work? Easier to track us. _jack_ It would be nicer to have this from another company, yes. I also wonder, how much Google keeps for themselves? Lord Argyris The official blurb is a little vague. Each time I visit a page without ads, my pass/account/whatever has the site's chosen cost deducted from it. What constitutes a "page"? If I refresh the tab, does that count as an additional page load? What if I visit an article again at a later date? What about those obnoxious sites that have an automatic reload timer? Could they game FC users? I'm sure all these questions will be answered in time. What I would have liked to have seen is some sort of a multiple tier system, whereby I can select specific participants (e.g AP) and offer to pay a flat monthly rate rather than a per-page fee, then leave the normal fee structure in place for others. It would be an easy way to donate more than I would ordinarily accumulate to places I come frequently, without forcing said sites to set up their own donation system. No matter what tier FC visitors choose, the site gets money. FelschR It's stated quite clearly: "Note: you are charged each time you visit or refresh a page, even if you have previously visited it." https://support.google.com/contributor/answer/7359560?hl=en&ref_topic=6182570 Matías Duarte I've only used AdBlock for AP the moment that those ads magically opened a new popup while scrolling without even touching them. Now that the annoying problem is gone, I've disabled it. I know no one cares about this but I finally got accepted for a job and I'll get my very first payment tomorrow, so I would happily pay a contribution for this page! Jeff Beck I'll be one to care. Congrats! Getting paid is awesome. At least that's what the other writers at AP tell me. ZettabyteGamer How long till I can use this with you guys? I'm itching to try it out, but this is the only site I really read everyday. Necdet Ali Özdür I think the real question here is what Google means by "fewer ads". Are all kinds of ads will be blocked or just intrusive ones? Will the trackers also be removed? someone755 Hmmm... https://youtu.be/4ezd24krgiQ Powsniffer0110 I'd be happy to pay 1¢ an article on AP and Phandroid, XDA ect.! Powsniffer0110 This is funny as hell lol. We're now paying Google to NOT give us ads... Haha.

Well, it turns out that the rumor was right. Google announced today that starting in early 2018, Chrome will stop showing ads on websites that aren’t compliant with the Better Ads Standards determined by the Coalition for Better Ads group. Google also confirmed that even its own ads will be blocked on a site if that site isn’t compliant. Meanwhile, a new report says that Google will give publishers at least six months to prepare for the new Chrome ad blocker. That’s according to the Wall Street Journal, whose sources explain that Google will offer an “Ad Experience Reports” tool that will alert publishers to so-called “bad ads” on their website and tell them how to fix the issue. Many websites across the web depend on advertising to keep their lights on, and so it’s good to hear that Google will give publishers plenty of time to make sure that their sites and the ads on them are compliant with the Better Ads Standards. While this new ad blocker will only be built into Chrome, Google’s browser is one of the most popular browsers around, so it’s a good idea for publishers to utilize Google’s ad-testing tool whenever its released. Do you use Google Chrome or do you prefer another web browser?

Segment fees paid by airlines, age of the technology and how long it takes to get anything new done are all popular reasons for GDS bashing. However, at an airline event last week, the bashing was reserved for Google Flight Search, which is ringing alarm bells for some in the travel industry for the strength it is gathering. It’s a subject close to the heart of CarTrawler’s technology chief Bobby Healy who first laid out his concerns here about a year ago. In short, Healy feels GFS is “very bad” for the airline industry (and travel in general), airline.com and future distribution. He sees the roll out of the service enables Google to extend its reach to the top of the trip planning funnel – i.e where consumers go first to start planning a trip. And, Healy thinks airlines need to evaluate GFS in a different way to other potential threats because of Google’s power and the data it has on consumers and their purchase intent. He says that “in good times” a GDS makes about $3 per booking, an airline makes about $21 but currently, according to Healy, Google is making $16 per online airline booking. “It’s growing every year, widening and deepening as they take more of the travel funnel.” It’s not about cost Healy was speaking at the CAPA conference in Dublin last week but said it’s actually not about cost but about “the loss of control.” He likens Google to a “blender” because it attracts more and more users with its products and ecosystem and gathers more information, data and insight on them. “They have more access to you customers then you’ll ever have, more insight into your customers, more data. It knows your customers location, it knows absolutely everything about your customer. “It has an engineering capability like nothing we’ve ever seen and produce products quicker than anyone else. “Airlines willingly give Google their pricing data and inventory in real time sub 10 response times. That key item is the problem here as you have created the perfect storm for intermediation of your own customer base.” What to do? Airlines can push back GFS on this by only giving up their data on their own terms. This is something Healy believes both American Airlines and Ryanair are doing. And, provide the sort of value Google is providing, via better mobile products, for example. Or, wait for the regulators to catch up. Those solutions seem weak as pointed out by CNN journalist Richard Quest who was moderating the CAPA session and says it’s like “trying to hold back the tide.” He questions whether it’s possible for the airline to be in control and own the customer with the number of distribution channels out there and ongoing disruption. But, ultimately control lies with the customer as Travelport global head of product and marketing Ian Heywood stresses. “That’s where it should reside but it’s about what is put in front of the customer. Is the airline going to be able to do that or is someone else going to do it for them?” Heywood says a more collaborative approach is the way forward so that airlines can improve how products and services are shown to consumers and it is no longer all about price. He adds that airlines need to take steps along an API path to move forward generally. “Everyone talks about disruption, that’s the reason no one has moved anywhere. Airlines have been waiting for a big disruption rather than working with the industry to plan evolution.” Steps to IATA NDC Heywood says airlines need to start using a combination of existing ATPCo technology and API to ensure their content is being distributed via various channels. “Once you have those steps in progress then arilines can see how they can get more content into the API path.” He stresses that it’s going to take a lot of time and will require investment in both API technology and a merchandising platform. “ATPCO works well and is really efficient so we’ve got to make sure new technology and processes are as effective and as efficient.” Heywood adds that carriers will also need to “reengineer the human process” to get buy in from everyone. The last word So, taking into consideration slim margins, 40 years of technology and the complex fare structure – can it be done? Healy says airlines really need to focus on what the problem is. SAP general manager and global head of travel & transportation Paul Pessutti adds that the airline industry needs to invest in areas such as data science. For Heywood, although the industry is only a “minute way along the path” – the technology is there and the standard is there so it’s just about bringing it all together. NB: Reporter’s flights and accommodation costs at the conference were supported by Travelport.   Previous Article Next Article   About the Writer :: Linda Fox Linda Fox is deputy editor for Tnooz.

Why would they want to create a channel conflict with their biggest customers while concurrently entering a business with far lower margins than advertising? Seems to me Google’s strategy must be, as always, to organize this data (content as we call it in the industry) and provide sensible options to the consumer based on everything Google knows about the consumer and the terms of their search. The options provided will be OTA and Supplier.com. Both OTAs and Suppliers need to start thinking about 1) how best to market through a mix of organic & paid search and 2) how to convert users that come to them through search. Almost like real-live eCommece retailers…. The Meta-Search brands seem to be ahead of the curve from my view as a consumer. Reply 7 hrs ago   Ted There’s only one reason why I start with Google Flights anytime I search for a flight — it doesn’t suck. (1) it doesn’t take forever to give me results; (2) it doesn’t bias the result based on whatever airline is giving them more money (3) the results isn’t cluttered with pop-ups reading “978 other people are buying this ticket” or “add insurance to this trip” (4) they give me the information I want (type of aircraft, meal or no meal, seat pitch or, if in business, lie flat or slanted seats, entertainment or no entertainment, Wi-Fi or no Wi-Fi, etc.), (5) they compare buying separate tickets on roundtrips, (6) their recommendations are usually very good and (7) they allow me to compare flights from different airlines. As a consumer, it’s very clear that the enemy in airline distribution are the airline themselves, whose sites totally suck. For example, on the site from the world’s largest airline, American Airlines, I can’t even tell what meals are included in my $2,000 business class ticket, what type of seat I will be sitting in, or if there will be any seatback entertainment. Why would I ever want to start my purchase there? You should ask consumers before writing articles! Reply 2 weeks ago   N Funny that Mr. Healy balks at the $16 GFS makes per booking, then he goes on to talk about how Google has more access to customers and engineering capability no one else has. Perhaps the $16 is commensurate for the value added by the capabilities/data/funnel of Google that airlines don’t have (and will probably never have). However, I do agree that airlines may be working themselves into a corner by embracing Google. I would also like to know where the $16 number comes from. I suspect he is confusing revenue and profit. Reply 2 weeks ago   Bobby Healy Hi N, not confusing rev from profit…the number on GOOG is indeed rev, because it’s impossible to get to EBITDA based on the numbers they publicly disclose. That number is actually provided by a recent SKIFT article. I think it’s fair to compare GOOGs rev alongside other numbers as an indicator of how rich the segment is for them and how much they are ultimately taking out of the total wallet. Ultimately, ALL of these costs will be paid by the consumer – so the more GOOG take, either the airlines have to subsidise that in some way, or the Hotel and other ancillary aggregators do. Or…(and this is what the EU believes), the Consumer will end up paying. The more expensive advertising becomes, the more the prices will have to rise, or margins decline. And there will only be ONE winner in that equation. The monopoly that controls ALL the traffic. Reply 2 weeks ago   Josh Gunn So Lufthansa estimates that selling a fare through the GDS amounts to €16 and Google is apparently earning $16 (€14.35 as of May ’17) for a flight booked through GFS. Which is the better user experience for the person actually paying for the ticket? Undeniably GFS. Admittedly not a complete apples to apples comparison as both sets of figures are assumptive, but when cost is more or less equal, user experience wins. I agree that a travel industry dominated by Google and Amazon isn’t a future many people, including myself, want but it’s basic human nature to want 1. Choice 2. Value and 3. Simplicity. These things will not change. If the industry ignores that and keeps treating people like they shouldn’t be trying to compare costs and offerings in a quick and simple way then they’ll have nobody to blame but themselves. They should redouble their efforts to build loyal brand followers (looking at you United, BA) while accepting that for many, we just want the cheapest flight with the least amount of hassle involved in booking it. Ps. An airline’s brand investment should inform the user’s decision ahead of time, not dictate it at the point of sale. Reply 2 weeks ago   Ian R Clayton Well GDS is pretty outdated and it time for modern technology and up to date systems to replace it. I am not happy that is Google. It is being very disruptive to travel companies now, from hotels to activities and all the steps from planning to purchase. Its power is unrelenting and it looks poised to close down all the small companies who provide services to travels and hotels. We do not want a single company dominating the entire landscape! Reply 2 weeks ago   Henry Harteveldt ATPCO may “work” well but it is as relevant as a DC-6 in today’s airline world. Airlines are, as the should be, intent on pursuing dynamic pricing, which means less reliance on pre-filed fares and, in turn, ATPCO. Reply 2 weeks ago   Ian Tunnacliffe Henry, you are right but with very few exceptions airlines are literally years away from being able to do dynamic pricing. And this whole mantra about GDSs being outdated is something I have been hearing for more than 20 years. Remember the GDSs rôle is providing data to intermediaries who then interpret it for consumers. These intermediaries may be human travel agents or additional technology layers. The end consumer should never see a raw GDS display. With that in mind, where are the deficiencies in GDS technology? I can think of some but they are as much to do with airlines’ inability to provide their offers in a modern form as they are about the GDSs inability to consume them. Lest anyone be unclear, I do think that the GDSs have been under responsive to airlines’ wishes to update their proposition and I certainly think that there was a period from roughly 1995 to 2005 when they were guilty of some horrific price gouging. All that said, any airline that wants to switch to an API connection to the GDSs is able to do it today, so why have so few outside the LCC space chosen to do so? Reply 2 weeks ago   Paul Byrne Henry, Agree that the desire for airline to retake control, make the offer and know their customer in order to better serve them is the way forward. All of this in real time, in addition. Cost saving/reduced filing/fewer ADMs are all desirable outcomes also.

[Update: Site is live, more details] Google launches Funding Choices, a way for users to pay sites to hide ads Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/06/01 8:01pm PDTJun 1, 2017 35 Plus 1 on G+ 77 Share on Facebook 59 Share on Twitter Total Shares171 Games News Update 1: 2017/06/01 8:01pm PDT The new site for Google Contributor/Funding Choices is live, and offers some new insight into how the service actually works. According to the signup page, each page without ads You may recall Google Contributor, which was a service by Google that allowed users to pay a monthly contribution to see fewer ads online. Your money would directly substitute the money earned by the site for advertisements. Contributor was discontinued in late 2016, with Google saying that an improved version would become available in "early 2017." Today, the company launched Funding Choices, the successor to Contributor. Currently in beta, it allows sites to show a customized message to visitors using an ad blocker. The message asks users to either enable ads for the site, or pay for a pass through Contributor that removes all ads on that site. Unlike the original Contributor, Funding Choices hides more than just AdSense ads If you're reading this and thinking, "I really wish Android Police would do this," then you're in luck. We've been part of Google's internal beta, but we're not quite ready to roll it out. Just know that we are definitely working on it. The new Contributor site doesn't seem to be live yet, but there will likely be more details there soon. Source: Google Update 1: 2017/06/01 8:01pm PDT The new site for Google Contributor/Funding Choices is live, and offers some new insight into how the service actually works. According to the signup page, each page without ads that you view on a site costs a small amount, with publishers apparently able to change the price (most of them seem to use $0.01 per page right now). So assuming $0.01 per page, $1 gets you 100 pages without ads, and Google is offering a $5 pass to start out with. Not bad pricing at all, as long as sites stay around the $0.01 price point. Google also offers a list of sites supporting Google Contributor, which currently includes Beliefnet, Business Insider UK, ComicBook, Eurogamer, Grub Street, Hot Air, Parkers, Patheos, Popular Mechanics, Townhall, Twitchy, and World Wide Gaming.

NexusPhan The ads in AP are not bad. Very reasonable and not intrusive at all. I have this site whitelisted to help support their great work. You should consider it too before funding choices goes live. MJ There is certainly websites with much more obnoxious ads but their is a lot of ads on AP. It's just not an acceptable user experience and I not going to subject myself to it. I have been calling for a way to donate to AP for awhile now (why did AP have to wait for a Google solution?) so we see how this plays out. Alex Dueppen Unfortunately Disqus hasn't been the same way, it seems to often load ads that redirect you to those scam "You are winner" pages that try to look like facebook. Adriannacsmith Google is paying 97$ per hour! Work for few hours & have longer with friends and family! !dy164c: On tuesday I got a great new Land Rover Range Rover from having earned $8752 this last four weeks..

NeverrKnowsBest I have gotten full screen malware ads from AP before. I did not want to block them, but they forced my hand. NexusPhan They did have a bad streak of ads for a while about a year ago. I remember that now that you say it. I enabled ad blocker for a few months after it happened. Corbin Davenport I will say that those are normally from Disqus, and we've worked with Disqus in the past to identify them and get them removed. ZettabyteGamer I'm sure it would be hard but if disqus is causing so many problems, maybe you should switch to a different comment section or make your own? Justin W I'd agree that AP's ads aren't bad, but Disqus's are terrible. Irwin LOL are you seriuos? on mobile, like half the site is all ads. It's ridiculous. blueman24 I'm ok with whitelist for sites like AP on desktop but on mobile, I don't want any ads. AP can add 5 more ads on their desktop site but don't cripple performance on my already slow phone. Rashad Would it be a one time cost or is this a cost each time we visit a participating site? Corbin Davenport I believe it's a monthly subscription, just like the previous Contributor. MJ Questions? Why did AP have to wait for a Google solution? There are many ways you could have been collecting money all this time. A automatic monthly subscription? Sounds like a loser already as people hate that. It's not going to be a set amount but like pick an amount right? An annual subscription would make more sense. Why can't there just be a simple donate button so people could send money when they can and just continuing blocking the ads ourselves like we have been already doing? Cai Copley It's that you do it in one, centralized location for such a subscription, and not doing it over a series of sites and forgetting how much you're spending. MJ I guess need more details on how it works... Jeff Beck We'll have a special rate for you MJ. .005 cents per article, $15 per grumpy comment submitted. We are going to make a fortune off you ;) George https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4ba5750c423a92daff44db461bb3042c433e0f5e7edc1f8dadcb32198db0d5e8.jpg Mark Curtis Or just block ads and not pay! I'm entitled to free content! gimme gimme gimme. faceless128 it's about safety. there are so many malicious advertisements out there. if a site doesn't directly control the ads that show up, how can they ensure our safety? Camerooni I use privacy badger.. if it blocks ads that play bad - I'm okay with that alongside blocking tracking cookies etc. What I don't like is sites assuming that if you're blocking an ad network that plays bad with you that you're the bad guy.. Things have to work both ways. Ailín Ó’S I wonder will this work internationally or just USA only because I use adblock and don't have AP (for example) whitelisted because of the sheer volume of ads on the site especially from the likes of Disqus with their "Congrats! You're a winner!" and "Local man makes 999.999€ a day with this trick!" spam. cadtek91 I'd imagine it would work with anyone with a Google account? Fabrice Thomas Seems like it's only available in these contries: US, Germany, New Zealand and UK https://support.google.com/contributor/answer/6182581?hl=en Jeff Beck If you want to just pay me directly I'll give you my PayPal address. That'll make things even easier on you. I know, I'm way too nice to you all, you're welcome. TechGuy22 Thanks but I'll stick adblock and adaway needa If you guys are wanting input, which I know you didn't ask for, five bucks a year would be my max. Not sure how it works, but I would want that on my mobile device. Desktop chrome has what I need in an extension. Ultimately that would earn more money from me, as i get on this sight far less with mobile chrome. Good_Ole_Pinocchio 5 bucks a year? What does that Pay for? Beer for the staff? needa If everyone that comes to this site with adblock paid five bucks, I doubt they would complain. Jeffrey Spiers Brave browser has this built into the browser directly, have used the feature on some of my most frequented sites. Switched to Brave due to many sites detecting and bitching about ad blockers recently. Good_Ole_Pinocchio Web Ads are trash, always. But I've never used ad blockers. Because if I'm taking the content, I'm taking the ads, or I just don't go to the site if the ads are really horrible. I'd more than pay for no ads. psy spy You have to sign in to your gmail account for this to work? Easier to track us. _jack_ It would be nicer to have this from another company, yes. I also wonder, how much Google keeps for themselves? Lord Argyris The official blurb is a little vague. Each time I visit a page without ads, my pass/account/whatever has the site's chosen cost deducted from it. What constitutes a "page"? If I refresh the tab, does that count as an additional page load? What if I visit an article again at a later date? What about those obnoxious sites that have an automatic reload timer? Could they game FC users? I'm sure all these questions will be answered in time. What I would have liked to have seen is some sort of a multiple tier system, whereby I can select specific participants (e.g AP) and offer to pay a flat monthly rate rather than a per-page fee, then leave the normal fee structure in place for others. It would be an easy way to donate more than I would ordinarily accumulate to places I come frequently, without forcing said sites to set up their own donation system. No matter what tier FC visitors choose, the site gets money. FelschR It's stated quite clearly: "Note: you are charged each time you visit or refresh a page, even if you have previously visited it." https://support.google.com/contributor/answer/7359560?hl=en&ref_topic=6182570 Matías Duarte I've only used AdBlock for AP the moment that those ads magically opened a new popup while scrolling without even touching them. Now that the annoying problem is gone, I've disabled it. I know no one cares about this but I finally got accepted for a job and I'll get my very first payment tomorrow, so I would happily pay a contribution for this page! Jeff Beck I'll be one to care. Congrats! Getting paid is awesome. At least that's what the other writers at AP tell me. ZettabyteGamer How long till I can use this with you guys? I'm itching to try it out, but this is the only site I really read everyday. Necdet Ali Özdür I think the real question here is what Google means by "fewer ads". Are all kinds of ads will be blocked or just intrusive ones?

Google confirms it will block bad ads in Chrome, starting in early 2018 Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/06/01 3:35pm PDTJun 1, 2017 52 Plus 1 on G+ 273 Share on Facebook 79 Share on Twitter Total Shares404 Applications Google News About two months ago, the Wall Street Journal reported that Google would add an ad-blocking feature into the Chrome web browser. Similar to AdBlock Plus' default setting, Chrome would block ads deemed unacceptable (such as pop-ups, auto-playing video ads, etc). Google has now confirmed this, and shared further details about how it will work. In a post on the company's blog, Google announced that it is joining the Coalition for Better Ads, an industry group attempting to improve online ads. The group has developed the Better Ads Standards, a list of guidelines for desktop and mobile ads based on comprehensive research. Ads deemed unacceptable include pop-ups, auto-playing video ads with sound, large sticky ads, and other common formats. In the post, Google confirmed that Chrome will soon not show ads, including those served by Google, on websites not in compliance with the Better Ads Standards. The change will take effect in "early 2018." This is huge news, especially considering that Google serves more online ads than any company on Earth. Now that Chrome has approximately 60% of the desktop browser market share (and growing), sites will likely have no choice than to follow the guidelines.

Can get rid of those annoying app install ads when browsing on the phone! Corbin Davenport Yeah, I think those are included, since they stick to the top while scrolling. Mgamerz Great news, but I guarantee you there's going to be a shitstorm headed their way really quick. Corbin Davenport Oh for sure. Something something free market. bekifft This is huge. However if they don't address the issue of deceptive ads, it's still a big problem. Hopefully one day I can finally in good conscience stop installing ad blockers as simply a security measure to protect my users. Corbin Davenport I haven't looked through all of the standard's documentation, but I don't see anything about deceptive ads. But I agree, that should be addressed. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Using any download site is an exercise in frustration. "Which giant 'Download Here' button is the right one?! Oh, of course, it's the tiny text link buried between three of them." Santos Chavez Ugh, I hate those sites with a passion. They're part of the reason i vehemently block ads. Take your stupid large fake green buttons outta here, filths :3 Adriannacsmith Google is paying 97$ per hour!

Gregory Will there be an option to block all ads without exceptions? Corbin Davenport Most likely not. Artem Russakovskii Sort of, but if you subscribe to sites running Funding Choices and use Contributor to buy an ad-free pass. Which is how it should be if you want to enjoy quality content from creators. Good ads and free if you don't. No ads and small fee if you do. Bimmer Ime or you can install an adblocker and enjoy no ads and no fee :) Tom Westrick And the sites you enjoy won't be able to sustain themselves... Nathan J Are they hurting now? Because that's what we have now. We have ad blockers, and we have ABP with its acceptable ads, but a lot of people turn it off. How about the sack on that guy, telling the main guy at AP to block ads on his own site? I'm a block-everything guy too, but I'm going to be seriously looking into this Funding Choices thing. I don't want my ad-free page views being wasted on just any old site, but sites I read daily, like AP and Neowin, I definitely want to see them get their cut. R Firestone ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ That would kill the internet and you would have to pay for everything. Ads are what make the internet free Gregory You know, they can always make money on others, not on me. Most people don't bother blocking ads, they simply don't care. Mark Curtis Yeah gimme free entertainment, but YOU foot the bill! David The internet was in fact a much *worse* place before ads became a thing. All the nice stuff you have access to now only exists because of ad revenue (email, YouTube, any and all social networking platforms) Toys Samurai He reminds me of some people whom I know -- always say they hate ads and would rather pay for it. But when the content provider actually asks for money, they don't open up their wallets. Jorgen Phillips This is the most hippocritical thing I think I have ever read. Toys Samurai Exactly. This very site he's reading would not even exist if everyone blocks ads. David That's not true, they could just use a different monetization model. Nathan J Hypocritical. You may be thinking of the hippocratic oath, where the famous phrase "do no harm" comes from. If only ads would pledge to do no harm... Nathan J There already is. That's what we have now. I mean, we have the no ad blocker option, which is default. Then you have Adblock Plus's default setting, which whitelists ads ABP considers to be not malicious. And that's what Google is doing. Then you have ABP with that feature turned off, or something like uBlock Origin, that just blocks all the ads indiscriminately. This is a future measure that is designed to be more tolerant than current "all or nothing" solutions, plus Google is an advertising business. So, there probably won't be. Eddy Nelson Lopez They profit from it, why would they do it? 😂😂 Corbin Davenport They won't profit from it if a majority of users have an ad blocker. Which is where things are headed right now. exadeci They can blocks ads from everyone except theirs and having the most popular browser they can sell the exclusivity to other ad agencies. Corbin Davenport "In the post, Google confirmed that Chrome will soon not show ads, including those served by Google, on websites not in compliance with the Better Ads Standards." exadeci Couldn't they just prevent bad ads on their platform?! Imparus The problem is how you serve them to the user. If you create a popup filled with Google ads, it would be bad ads even thought they are Google approved ads. exadeci Right but if they can detect it in Chrome why can't they use this to disable the ads on the website that abuses it? Sonny Bono I'm guessing it's a preventative measure, seeing how many people get virused through some popup ads that they don't realize are a pathway to malicious software. We certainly don't want another epidemic of ransomware. I find most of my service calls go to elderly people who have no idea what they're doing and get tons of malware/ransomware. One old lady I was working with a few weeks ago actually "called microsoft" per the directions on her browser and gave them her credit card number. It wasn't really microsoft. abqnm As long as it takes care of the shady JavaScript click event pop-unders and other such js deceptive ad techniques which are generally not able to be caught by ad-blockers. I would really love to be able to go back to having JavaScript enabled and blacklist only certain sites rather than have to keep it disabled and whitelist the majority of my internet experience. TW Does this mean my phone won't connect constantly start vibrating because of ads on legitimate sites? raazman I'm sorry you have to experience this is this day and age. AintaDamnThingFunny This!! I've always wondered how those got through Chrome's security. I mean, it's an obtrusive add that makes your phone vibrate, and all you can do is close out the browser. How the hell do those get through and how has Google not stopped this from happening? Imparus Because a website can access the vibrator API, this is useful in the example of facebook, where you can activate notification for the site, and not having to use their shitty app. TW Now I know what to call the thing I hate: Vibrator API BRO i prefer my phone silent, no notification sound or vibration, as i mostly use my pc with pushbullet mirroring Santos Chavez OMG I hate those types of ads! Especially when the ads that popup are so obstrusive I can't do anything but exit Chrome. Ugh! blindexecutioner Doesn't affect me much. I already block ads. Nathan J It's not meant to affect you or I or anyone else who knows what uBlock Origin is. Google Chrome is the most popular browser, so I imagine what it will affect is the 60% or however many people use Chrome, and all of a sudden they're blocking malicious ads. That will affect a lot. I suspect for you and I, we will probably be able to just disable Google's solution and use our own, and if Google blocks other ad blockers, there's always Chromium. AS The biggest annoyances for me are subscribe popovers and EU cookie warnings. Things like taboola and outbrain need to be aggressively blocked. Lateef Alabi-Oki I'll disable my ad blocker if this gets rid of malicious and egregious ads. Nexus Hexus I'm sure most of these "Bad ads" will be alternative media. Or aka "Whatever we don't agree with" boop It's not content that's blocked, but format. Sonny Bono Ironically, all the ads that I find bothersome are on google services themselves, such as YouTube, but I have a Chrome extension (ublock origin) that works to get rid of them. Santos Chavez I enjoy YouTube so much, I pay for YouTube Red, via the Google Play Music Family Plan . Haven't seen an ad, especially on mobile. for months, and I get unlimited music streaming and downloading, all of those features shared to 5 other users. Pretty neat. Gary But do they block those annoying as hell forced Google surveys? Lord Argyris "...Google confirmed that Chrome will soon not show ads, including those served by Google, on websites not in compliance with the Better Ads Standards." I'm going to guess they're including their own ads here to avoid anticompetitive suits from competing ad providers. If they just blocked the other ads and left their own (presumably compliant ads), they would be gaining an unfair advantage and could be seen to be leveraging their strength in the browser market to incentivize use of their own ad platform. I wondered about this in my comment on the previous AP article on the subject, and it seems Google has considered the matter as well. Santos Chavez Yeah, it's kinda neat; by doing it that way Google avoids all sorts of blames of being hypocrites while also setting the example for everyone. "THIS", they say, "is how ads should be done. Look, we're even doing them to our own; you should, too". Terra Remove the ads that play before a video and we got a deal. Small banners below the video? Ok. Playing a commercial before the content I actually want to see? That is old tv bullcrap and is annoying as hell, even more so than popups. Dennis Ulijn "But, but, but...

Puerto Rican residents could order from the US Google Store, but now Google has created a seperate Store just for the island itself. The Google Store country picker, which lists all of the countries with their own Store, has been updated to include Puerto Rico. In addition, the support document listing product availability by country has been updated with mentions of the island. Currently, only the Google Pixel, Daydream View, Samsung Chromebook Plus, and various accessories are available for purchase. Still, at least Puerto Rico residents can now buy an unlocked Pixel straight from Google. You can view the island's Google Store at the source link below.

I ordered my Nexus 4 and a Pixel C from google store. And I obviously live in Puerto Rico. Frisi Just put United States in the billing address and you're good to go. ;) Christian Camacho My account always had access to Google Devices and I live in PR. I've been ordering from the Google Store since the Nexus 4. I'm confused. Frisi This is for those who put Puerto Rico as country instead of United States. I always put my address to United States as country, since we're part of the US. If I put Puerto Rico it even locks me out of the Play Store (except for apps and games). Frisi It has always worked. Since we're part of the United States, we could put US as country and have access to Google's entire hardware catalogue. I have ordered the Pixel, Nexus 5X, Chromecast, Chromebooks, cases, etc. Same applies with Google Play itself. If you put US as country, Movies, Music, and Books works. If you put just Puerto Rico as country then you're locked out from the aforementioned services. Artem Russakovskii That is mind-bogglingly dumb, especially since https://support.google.com/store/answer/2462844 now provides specific exclusions for Puerto Rico for most products. Frisi I don't even know. I know I have been redirected to the Puerto Rico section for weeks now. Possibly a month or so. All I do is change back to the US and order normally. I haven't had any issues at all. Products work here fine (Pixel, Assistant, Home, Chromecast) even with local services. Josue Rivera Well according to that page chromecast is not available in PR, yet I own one that I purchased through Google on the last black friday sale they had with HBO streaming service. Same deal as Frisi said I use the US store and in address use US (which isn't wrong as we are a territory that depends on USPS anyways) lol. So now we have "official" store with half the products locked out... Artem Russakovskii ¯_(ツ)_/¯ MJ Great, now that Puerto Rico has access to the Play store next thing you know they will want to be US citizens. Frisi We *are* US citizens... MJ Shhhhh... Most people in the US don't know that. Tom Westrick They already are US citizens MJ I guess should have ended my comment with /joke.

U.S. Editions Australia Edition China Edition India Edition Italy Edition Japan Edition Singapore Edition United Kingdom United States Jun 02, 2:40 AM EDT Subscribe Search Search Business Technology World National Media & Culture Millennial Money Entertainment Sports Subscribe Technology Google Will Bring Ad Blocking Features To Chrome Browser By Eric Chiu @eric_chiu On 06/01/17 AT 7:37 PM Close Ads have long been a necessary part of web browsing, but it’s only been in recent years that users have fought back against ads they’ve found distracting. Soon, they’ll also have a notable company in their corner: Google. In a post Thursday, Google confirmed it will begin to integrate its own ad blocking features into its Chrome browser starting in early 2018. Google plans to follow existing standards set up by the Coalition for Better Ads, an industry group of online advertisers, to determine which ads to block. Read: Google Reportedly Planning To Put Native Ad-Blocking Feature In Chrome Ads that the Coalition for Better Ads considers problematic include pop-ups, full-screen ads and auto-playing videos. Google’s announcement said the move to start actively supporting smarter ad blocking came from the way most users experience sites today. “The reality is, it’s far too common that people encounter annoying, intrusive ads on the web — like the kind that blare music unexpectedly, or force you to wait 10 seconds before you can see the content on the page,” Google said. “These frustrating experiences can lead some people to block all ads — taking a big toll on the content creators, journalists, web developers and videographers who depend on ads to fund their content creation.” Publishers will be able to audit their sites through Google’s Ad Experience Report tool to determine what ads would violate its new standards and learn about ad formats that would follow new guidelines. Google also plans to pair its ad filtering tools with other support features. The company is currently testing a whitelisting feature called Funding Choices with several publishers. Through the feature, publishers can show a message to readers who have enabled a third-party ad blocker encouraging them to either enable ads or pay a small fee to go ad-free. CNBC reported Google will take an estimated 10 percent of payments made through Funding Choices. Google’s move reflects a shifting attitude among readers, publishers and advertisers toward online advertising. While ads have been a major way for publishers to earn income to fund their sites, readers have become increasingly opposed to ads they find disruptive. Read: Best Chrome Extensions To Help You At Work, Keep Organized In the past, users have simply had to bear with advertising but with tools like ad blockers and video filtering, users can now block and disable ads that they find distracting. As a response, publishers have increasingly turned to appeals to readers about the effect ad blockers have on their bottom line and offered alternatives like ad-free micropayment passes. Google’s willingness to take on ad blocking services means publishers can outsource this work directly to another company. Third-party extensions like Adblock have filled in the gap for many users, but on Google’s end, they likely want to bring such functionality in-house. In April, Google was rumored to be looking into bringing ad blocking to Chrome. Join the Discussion Most Read The Newsletter Exclusive articles delivered to your inbox daily.

X Close Nation Home > News > Nation < Back to SMG 45 Friday, 2 June 2017 Doodle 4 Google art competition returns Best of the best: (From left) Head of Marketing at Google Malaysia Jon Day, Head of Google For Education Malaysia Rahayu Ramli and Sajith showing their favourite local doodles. PETALING JAYA: The Doodle 4 Google Malaysia art competition is back after three years. Google Malaysia, Vietnam, the Philippines and New Emerging Markets managing director Sajith Sivanandan announced its comeback in conjunction with Malaysia’s 60th National Day. “The theme for this year’s competition is Celebrating Malaysia’s Diversity, and we are inviting children age seven to 17 to show their creativity and stand a chance for their creation to be viewed by potentially 24 million people in Malaysia,” he told a press conference at the Google Malaysia headquarters here yesterday. “We hope to see doodles that best represent Malaysia’s diversity and most importantly, we are also looking for imagination and creativity,” he added. The competition is divided into four age groups: seven to nine, 10-12, 13-15 and 16-17. The winners in each group will be assessed by the Doodlers team at Google headquarters in Mountain View, California, to decide on the final doodle that will be used on the Google homepage on Malaysia Day, Sept 16. The previous Doodle 4 Google winner was Lee Yee Run, whose doodle beautifully depicted the theme Malaysia To Me Is ... with his sketch of the country’s tourist attractions patterned around the Google name. His sketch was displayed on the Google homepage on Sept 16, 2014. Google Doodles are thematic changes made to the Google logo and typically done to celebrate special occasions, cultural moments, and the lives of pioneers, scientists, musicians and artists who have helped shape history. Notable Malaysians who received the Google Doodle treatment in the past include P. Ramlee, Yasmin Ahmad, Mokhtar Dahari and Sybil Kathigasu. The closing date for entries is July 31.

An old patent filing, dug up by the folks at Patently Apple and granted prior to its big phone reveal this week, show a concept device shaped like a standard pair of eyeglasses, but with camera and display hardware built in. Much like Snapchat’s Spectacles, this theoretical Essential device would be used to capture eye-level photo and video with a built-in camera. However it would go further, more in the vein of Google’s ill-fated Glass headset, by adding digital information and images to real life scenes with some type of augmented reality tech. The filing describes the device working with prescription lenses, photo sensitive lenses, and standard sunglass lenses. There is also talk of a “dual-mode display,” which would present visual overlays and use an inward facing camera to perform eye tracking. Photo: Patently Apple The patent also describes AR use cases like real-time price matching of products in a store. “Based on the environment that the user sees, and based on the direction of the user's gaze, the processor can display an image to augment the environment around the user,” the filing reads. “For example, if the user is looking at a barcode of an item, the processor can display cheaper purchasing options of the same item." This is of course not a real product, at least not yet. Though from what we’ve seen from Essential, which starts shipping its new Essential Phone later this month or early July, it’s clear the company has serious hardware ambitions to take on the biggest players in the tech industry. We don’t know quite yet whether the Essential Phone can keep pace with the iPhone or its fellow top-tier Android competitors, nor do we know if the company’s Essential Home will be a viable smart speaker compared with offerings from Google and Amazon. But if Essential can arrive early to the smart glasses market, it could just gain an early edge in a sector not yet dominated by a big Silicon Valley player.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Cars TECH Android Apple Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable MORE Entertainment Science Health Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Cars Tech   Android Apple Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable More   Entertainment Science Health Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search Chrome will have a built-in ad-blocker starting in early 2018 Brittany A. Roston - Jun 1, 2017 0 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Back in April, we reported on sources that claimed Google was going to bake an ad-blocker directly into its Chrome browser, something that would block advertisements deemed to be intrusive and/or disruptive for visitors. Google has confirmed that report today, shedding light on a crucial detail that was missing the first time around: Chrome will block all advertisements on a website that doesn’t adhere to Better Ads Standards. Ad-blocking software has become increasingly popular, much to the detriment of online publications that rely on advertisement revenue. These ad-blockers are utilized due to obnoxious, intrusive, or otherwise bothersome ads that some websites splash across every page, forcing visitors to wait a certain amount of time before they can visit the page, to hunt for and mute a random video ad that starts playing, and more. Google detailed this reality recently in a long post, explaining that some Internet users block all advertisements in an effort to avoid the most annoying ads…and that harms content producers who have to figure out new ways to overcome the lost revenue. Here to help everyone, then, is a more selective ad-blocking process, one that will start next year. According to Google, Chrome will begin blocking all the advertisements on websites that fail to adhere to Better Ads Standards…including its own ads. This process will begin sometime in early 2018, and will hopefully mark the perfect compromise between all and no ads: Web users won’t have to deal with problematic advertisement practices, and publishers, in return, won’t have all of their advertisements blocked across the board.

Report: Google’s Chrome ad blocker coming to both PC and mobile ‘within 6 months’ Ads on sites that don't follow Coalition for Better Ads guidelines will be blocked. Greg Sterling on June 1, 2017 at 6:50 pm More In April, The Wall Street Journal reported that Google was going to introduce an ad blocker into Chrome. On Thursday, the publication confirmed the earlier report and said Google has put publishers on notice that the ad blocker is coming within six months to give them time to prepare. Chrome’s ad blocker will reportedly be turned on by default on both desktop and mobile web versions. The move appears to be a strong-arm tactic to improve the quality and performance of ads across the web. According to the Journal’s report, Google will inform publishers of poor ad experiences on their sites and instructions on how to fix any issues: To help publishers prepare, Google will provide a self-service tool called “Ad Experience Reports,” which will alert them to offending ads on their sites and explain how to fix the issues. The tool will be provided before the Chrome ad blocker goes live, the people familiar with the plans say . . . Unacceptable ad types include those identified by the Coalition for Better Ads… Think of it as an ad quality score for publishers. The report says that Chrome will block all advertising on sites that cross some threshold of unacceptable advertising. Prohibited ad types are those laid out by the Coalition for Better Ads, of which Google is a member. The following graphic reflects the Coalition’s list of unacceptable units for mobile devices. Non-compliant publishers will see ads on their sites blocked and revenues adversely impacted. While this is clearly a self-interested move on Google’s part, it’s also a move that could improve the overall state of digital advertising and lead to less consumer antagonism toward online ads. Ad blocking is a growing problem, with varying levels of blocking going on around the world. A recent report from AdBlock Plus found that 40 percent of PC owners in the US said they had used an ad blocker in the past month. That compares with 15 percent for mobile users. This translates into billions of dollars in lost impressions and clicks. Google’s initiative could preempt the use of third-party ad-blocking software. Assuming it comes to pass, the move will undoubtedly upset some publishers and could even trigger litigation. Chrome is the world’s most widely used browser, with 48 percent market share in North America and 54 percent globally.

How To Turn Your Old Android Into A Google Pixel Clone Eric Ravenscraft Jun 2, 2017, 9:00am ⋅ Filed to:  editor's picks google google pixel pixel Share Eight months on, and Google Pixel is still one of the best Android smartphones on the market. This is in large part due to innovative software features like Assistant and inbuilt unlimited cloud storage for photos and video. If you're still using an older handset, you can get most of the Pixel's big, best features with a few clever tweaks. Install Google Assistant on Your Current Phone Google Assistant is the headlining feature of the Pixel range. You can also use it on the Google Home speaker and Google's messaging app Allo. It really shines on a phone where it can scan what you're reading to find contextually-relevant information, give you a daily briefing on your way to work and take down reminders or find things around you. So, it's a little weird that Google locked it to a single phone. Fortunately, if you're comfortable with the rooting your phone or flashing .zips, you can get it on any phone running Marshmallow or higher. We've put together an in-depth guide here that walks you through the steps. The technique involves tricking your device into identifying as a Pixel XL instead of whichever model you have. Fortunately, this shouldn't affect day-to-day usage of your device. It's unclear if Google will continue to allow this workaround for long, but for now you can enjoy Assistant without having to get a whole new phone. Roll Your Own Unlimited Photo and Video Storage When Pixel launched, it was priced at a relatively expensive $1079. It's since fallen in price but will still set you back well over $800. To soothe that wound in your wallet, Google throws in free, unlimited, full-size photo storage for life for any photos you take with your Pixel, unlike the resolution-clipped unlimited storage you can already get with Google Photos. That's a pretty huge deal, since most photo backup services have some pretty big caveats. If you don't mind making a couple sacrifices, though, you can roll your own nearly unlimited photo storage. Here are some of the most popular cloud services, and how you can put them to use, no new phone required: Google Photos: Even if you don't buy a Pixel, Google will let you upload an unlimited amount of photos and videos with just one catch: They have to be less than 16 megapixels for photos or 1080p for videos. For most people, that's probably good enough, though you may want to be able to record video in 4K, even if you don't have a 4K TV. Flickr: With Flickr, you can save up to 1TB of photos and videos at their full resolution. 1TB isn't a lot, but it's a handy backup if you're hitting the limit on the other two. Dropbox: Nearly everyone has a Dropbox account already, so you may as well use it to backup your photos. Dropbox can automatically upload any photo or video to your account, regardless of its size. Your space can be fairly limited, but fortunately there are plenty of ways to get more. Between these three, you can probably backup just about anything. Your library will be a little disjointed, but you won't need to spring for a new phone just to back up everything you need. You can also use IFTTT to make it easier to manage multiple backup locations. IFTTT's Android channel can automatically upload photos you take to any cloud backup location. If you want to get more complex, you can use Tasker and IFTTT together to upload to a different service based on which folder you store pictures in. You can also build your own NAS storage to backup as many photos and videos as you have hard drive space for, instead of relying on another company to do it for you. Google's unlimited backup might be convenient, but it's far from your only option. Beef Up Your Photos and Shoot Better Video The camera on the Pixel is pretty impressive. Unfortunately, there's no app to change the hardware on your phone. Before you spend a ton of money on a new phone with a better camera, learn how to use the one you have first and unlock its best features. You can download the Google Camera app to get some of its coolest features like HDR or smart burst mode. While it's not compatible with every device, you can find APKs to install from APK Mirror here. If you want even more control over your photos or Google Camera doesn't work on your device, check out Camera ZOOM FX, one of our favourite camera alternatives for Android. It comes with a ton of advanced features like RAW support, burst shot modes and a ton of photo presets. It also has all of the tools to help you be a better photographer and learn how to compose and take better photos, no matter what camera you have — and sometimes that's what's important. You can even tweak the ISO, exposure, shutters speed and focus distance to get the perfect shot. Use Gestures and Quick Links to Make Your Home Screen More Useful In Android 7.1 you can long-press a shortcut on the home screen to find quick links to features within the app itself. For example, if you hold down the Google Maps icon, you can quickly navigate to home or work. This feature is being rolled out to everyone, but if your phone can't handle the OS update, try our favourite home screen replacement Nova Launcher Prime ($5.99). With this app installed, you can assign a shortcut to any icon on your home screen. We'll demonstrate by adding a navigation shortcut to Google Maps: If there isn't one already, add a Maps shortcut to your home screen. Long-press the app icon and tap Edit in the pop-up menu. Tap the "Swipe action" drop-down. Tap the Shortcuts tab along the top of the screen. Scroll down and tap Directions. Enter a destination address, like your home. Give it a name like "Navigate Home". Tap Save. Tap Done. Now, swipe up on the Maps icon on your home screen. This should immediately launch the Navigation feature of Google Maps with your home address already entered. This isn't quite the same as Android 7.1's feature, since you can only have one shortcut at a time. On the other hand, you get to customise it, instead of settling for whatever the developers decide to give you. Download Allo and Duo, Google's Messaging Apps If you visit the Pixel's store page, Google will tell you about apps like Allo and Duo, but they're far from Pixel exclusives. Allo, Google's intelligent messaging app, and Duo, its dead-simple 1-to-1 video chat app, are available on the Play Store for any compatible device. While Allo still needs some refinement, having Assistant built-in makes it a compelling alternative to other chat apps. Meanwhile, Duo is like a cross-platform Facetime, bringing easy video calls to both Android and iPhone users. Best of all, there's no need to buy a new phone just to try these out. Add a Reboot Button We're not sure why Google decided to wait until version 7.1 to bring back the reboot option to the Android power menu, but at least it's back. If your phone has yet to receive the 7.1 update, you can get it with Material Power Menu. This app works with or without root to give you a handy menu that lets you turn your phone off, reboot it or even boot into recovery or the bootloader. Without root, you can launch the app from a shortcut on your home screen, which is still pretty convenient. It will launch a simple screen with several power options available. If all you want is an easy way to reboot your phone, this is all you'll need. However, if you have root and Xposed, it will also automatically activate whenever you hold down your power button. It's a little thing, but if you constantly need to restart your phone, it can make a huge difference. WATCH MORE: Tech News & Life Hacks Comments Be the first to comment on this story!

By Stephanie Condon for Between the Lines | June 1, 2017 -- 22:26 GMT (15:26 PDT) | Topic: Security Google is giving publishers at least a half a year to prepare for the rollout of its built-in ad filter in Chrome, the Wall Street Journal reports. Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Once launched, the ad filter would be on by default for both desktop and mobile versions of the browser. While previously described to the Journal as an ad "blocking" feature, Google now reportedly frames the feature as a "filter" similar to Chrome's pop-up blocking windows or its malware warnings. Ad filters can, of course, be problematic for publishers that rely on advertising revenue. So Google is reportedly giving publishers a self-service tool called "Ad Experience Reports" that shows which ads violate Chrome's standards and how to fix them. The tool will be available before the ad filter goes live next year, the Journal reports. Google has reportedly told publishers that it plans to block all ads on a site if the site has a certain level of unacceptable ads. To determine which ads are acceptable, Google is apparently relying on standards set by the industry group the Coalition for Better Ads. While publishers -- and Google itself -- rely heavily on advertising dollars, consumers appear to be increasingly tired of disruptive ads. The use of ad blockers is on the rise, with one estimate suggesting there were 615 million devices running ad-blocking software in December 2016. According to the Journal, Google has also proposed a new tool for publishers called "Funding Choices" to push back against ad blockers. The tool would prompt Chrome users to either disable their ad blockers or pay the publisher for an ad-free experience.

If the user’s commands aren’t being picked up on, then there’s really not much point. It turns out that Google’s speech recognition efforts are chugging along just fine to the point where it is apparently at the same level as humans. This is according to Mary Meeker’s annual Internet Trends Report (via 9to5Google) where apparently Google’s machine-learning voice recognition system has achieved a 95% word accuracy rating for the English language. This is said to be the same threshold for human accuracy, which means that as far as recognizing words from users in English, Google’s speech recognition is pretty spot on. The report notes that Google has improved upon its efforts by nearly 20% since 2013, and all of this was previously touted by Google’s CEO Sundar Pichai during Google I/O 2017 where he noted that computers these days are getting better at understanding voice input. As 9to5Google points out, Google’s success at developing the technology has allowed them to create Google Home using just two microphones to pick up speech versus eight, and how it can support multiple users and recognize up to 6 of them at any given time.

Gboard v6.3 enables search suggestions in the Google app and widget for some Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/06/01 9:32am PDTJun 1, 2017 36 Plus 1 on G+ 60 Share on Facebook 41 Share on Twitter Total Shares137 Applications News Google dropped a new version of Gboard last night, which includes a number of cool improvements to search. Some people are reporting another interesting feature in the form of Google search suggestions int he Google app and widget. Not everyone seems to have this, though. On older versions of Gboard, the keyboard's suggestion bar disappears when doing a search. That's still what it looks like for myself and most other AP staff after the update to v6.3. However, we've heard from a not insignificant number of people who are seeing the suggestion bar. This appears when searching via the Google widget and within the Google app. It seems to work just like the suggestion bar elsewhere. Start typing, and the keyboard guesses what word you might want to use next based on your typing history and the power of Google's prediction engine. Just grab the new version of Gboard and open a search to see if you've got it. Download QR-Code Gboard - the Google Keyboard Developer: Google Inc.

Artem Russakovskii Yes https://plus.google.com/+ArtemRussakovskii/posts/aYxevnQNXK7 https://plus.google.com/+ArtemRussakovskii/posts/BsXuhKZQbmz F4LL0U7 I got that too, briefly. I think they accidentally pushed out the dogfood version. mike shwilly Somehow the suggestions/corrections bar doesn't even appear for me on menus like that. Anyone got a clue? https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/fcf5ae1af260f403d6fe67b4a16960601a0f678f624415845c966be49de6c152.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/7db6affa5d2544f41d448de7188c46494be0ca138cb1088830fd557174531b65.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/0729dbe9f8f2b6951428091c0dc20c66822aa0bd1fb3d8c8198fba4181bd896a.png Artem Russakovskii That's the mystery - I'm not seeing suggestions either, but many are. mike shwilly I think i had this problem since Nexus 5. It has always been really annoying. Suicide_Note Deftones are a terrible band. Hurricane Andrew I still do not see it on my S7 Edge. I wonder if launcher choice makes a difference. I use Action Launcher. Would be interesting to know what launcher people who are and are not seeing this are using. Yuri Vidal on my s7 it works. are you a beta tester? i also dont use touchwiz launcher. the suggestion bar works for me on chrome, and on google app too. jkl888 I see the suggestions on my phone Artem Russakovskii I'm on the Pixel Launcher, tried both Google app 7.2 and 7.3, and Gboard 6.2 and 6.3, and I don't have this. Reply and post your launcher, Google App version, and Gboard version, and whether you have suggestions or not. Armando Rodriguez Have you notice that the "short" height is shorter than previous versions? abqnm Are you on an S8 or G6? They tweaked some proportions on the odd aspect ratio devices. The S8 doesn't have the hugely tall spacebar anymore, which may be why it seems that way. If you're not on one of those I'm not sure as it seems the same to me. Armando Rodriguez Nexus 5 DPI at 420 Raz Have it. Nova Beta, GBoard 6.3.15.157483061-arm64-v8a, Google app 7.3.19.21.arm64. The new GBoard just asked for access to my SMS to improve the suggestions. Bruno Logerfo wait since when there's a dark theme for the google widget? João Ricardo He problaby has a theme kervation I am using a Google Pixel XL with the stock pixel launcher, running Google app version 7.3.19.21 & Google Gboard version 6.3.15.157483061. I have the suggestion bar for the Google app and also the Chrome beta browser and regular Chrome browser. I also have search suggestions show up when typing in the Google app. JATIN BANSAL I think this is also new. Earlier in dark themes, they used to have a white glow around emoji but now it is gone. I like it now https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/c8bcc901c9f60b97c05dc467df6fa4838f96cabcfbf6421714f5ec7189958205.png roberto.elena I wished the keyboard had a dynamic theme that would change automatically based on the app being used, like the status bar does: Youtube = red, WhatsApp = green, Facebook = blue, etc. thegrau There's a third party keyboard that does exactly that. Can't remember the name, but I believe it's based on AOSP Yuri Vidal chroma keyboard Łukasz Ordon There is also Xposed module that can do that... I used to use it but the framework is not available for 7.0+ yet... Adriannacsmith Google is paying 97$ per hour!

Lexster Okay, but...when will they put a freaking space after punctuation? It's not that difficult, but after using Swiftkey, I really can't get used to having to put a space after punctuation. catalysto I would NOT want that. Don't need my OCD flaring up with unnecessary spaces. Though, sure, it should probably be an option. Lexster How are spaces after periods of sentences unnecessary? hype67 In acronyms, when the dot doesn't denote the end of a sentence. As decimals. Others situations I can't remember off the top of my head. Lexster USe acronyms with periods a lot, do you? I can't remember the last time I did. It's not generally required for acronyms. You put FBI, not F. B. I. But, yes, it's a little annoying with decimals, but that can generally be programmed to recognize if the space isn't needed. Swiftkey often does. It misses sometimes, sure, but usually works well. If a field needs an IP address, it usually knows this and doesn't put a space. And yes, it can be annoying with website names, but it's much easier to backspace every once in awhile than have to hit space after every single period or question mark. Łukasz Ordon Just press space twice :P It puts full stop AND a space after it... Lexster Yes, but I prefer having the space after punctuation. Doesn't require two taps of the space bar. And it only enters periods. Łukasz Ordon Oh well... You can't make everyone happy... Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Typing URLs and email addresses is a giant pain in SwiftKey. catalysto When it's the last sentence. Lexster Okay? Well, it doesn't add a space until you type a letter, so if it's the last sentence, there wouldn't be a space unless you typed something else. catalysto A period does not always signify the end of a sentence though. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman So glad it doesn't do that. One of the worst things in SwiftKey. Typing URLs and email addresses was such a giant pain in the ass. Hitting space after I type a period isn't a big deal to me AT ALL. Especially since I'm used to typing on a keyboard anyway, so do it automatically. ozzyager I do see suggestions when doing a search. I also recieved the dog bone version first, before being updated again shortly thereafter. Maybe just a coincidence? catalysto Same thing happened to me. It's still working after updating to the non-beta version, too. Though I'm in the beta program for Gboard, so maybe that has something to do with it? My version number is 6.3.15.157483061-arm64-v8a, in case anyone is curious. Łukasz Ordon That Gboard app version with dog paw should not be released publicly. It indicates 'dogfood' version (as googlers call it) which should be tested only inside Google. Dogfood is just debug version of normal app (don't quote me on that tho) ozzyager Correct. This is why I wondered if there was any connection between that version being released by accident to some, like myself, and only some seeing the suggestions when doing a search. Of course it might just be a server side update that is being tested, etc. Łukasz Ordon I've myself got dogfood version but shortly after (like 5 mins later) I've received another update with normal apk... Armv7 version btw :p roberto.elena It also gives suggestions in Chrome while in incognito mode. abqnm While that may be unwanted, it should be pointed out that it now gives suggestions in the Chrome address bar. Period. Previously it did not suggest anything at all in the Chrome address bar, incognito or no. I still don't have it in search though. It does work when typing to Assistant, but it may have done that previously. boop Can someone explain the nav bar in the second pic? Łukasz Ordon It's probably Pixel phone navbar... destinyhud pixel phone if u mean the down arrow then when u click a bar the left become a down arrow boop The color, I mean Hurricane Andrew Running Action Launcher 3, Google app version 7.3.19.21, Gboard version 6.3.15.157483061 and do not have the suggestions in the search app. Łukasz Ordon Talking about Google app itself... apparently, cards in Google Now feed have new design now https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/5fbd4b5888c4ad6d684f6ab3ba7589a3354607b05f565c0b7aed404237d8d8dc.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/ed878edc7fa830f93bf49db1a7d5c8b4267ae6cada762eb9d0e723312cd72c5a.png Łukasz Ordon Aaaaand it's gone...

Teja The word prediction is the only thing I worry about. Swiftkey is way better than Gboard which made me to switch back to Swiftkey. Michael Oghia Does anyone else experience problems with the spell check feature? Sometimes I misspell a word, it tells me it's misspelled, but then doesn't offer any suggestions. It used to work better a few years ago (when it was still just keyboard or whatever it was called). Vratislav Jindra I would swear I had this yesterday. Today it disappeared.

Katie Pearce Jun 1, 2017 Comments Share on Facebook Tweet Kevin Lamarque/Reuters Tech vs. Trump: As President Donald Trump threatens to pull the U.S. out of the Paris climate agreement, the tech industry is speaking out in a big way. Tesla CEO Elon Musk suggested he would quit his White House advisory role over the reported Paris withdrawal, and a band of major tech companies—including Apple, Facebook, and Google—plan for a full-page ad in the New York Times urging Trump to stay in. Politico reports: Tech CEOs have been under widespread pressure, including in some cases from their own liberal-leaning workforces, to cut off engagement with Trump over his stances on immigration, LGBT issues and the environment. IBM's Ginni Rometty, for example, was the target of a campaign by employees to uphold the company's "core values of diversity, inclusiveness, and ethical business conduct" in response to her outreach to Trump early in his administration. Musk's warning carries particular weight because he's become one of the Trump White House's go-to tech industry executives. The Tesla and SpaceX CEO has taken part, for example, in the so-called President’s Strategic and Policy Forum.

The company told CNBC that it will allow publishers to participate in a new program called Funding Choices. Under the program, when a user with a third-party ad blocker enabled visits a participating site using Chrome, they will see a prompt that asks them to either turn off their ad blocker, or "pay for a pass that removes all ads on that site through the new Google Contributor." If they choose to pay the fee, Google will take a 10 percent cut. If they select neither choice, they won't be able to view the website. The move will help publishers who fear losing ad revenue from users with ad blockers turned on. Instead of having to manage these kinds of prompts themselves, publishers can essentially outsource this task to Google. To see the prompts, users must sign up to participate in the Google Contributor program, and must be signed in to Chrome. If they're not signed up and have an ad-blocker turned on, they won't be able to view the site. If they're not using an ad blocker at all, they'll be able to view the site as usual, complete with ads. Business Insider is among the participating sites, Google confirmed. However, publishers must first be compliant with ad standards from the Coalition of Better Ads, of which Google is a part, which could hurt some smaller publishers who have limited leverage over the types of ads they can accept. Publishers will be able to prepare their sites for these standards using an Ad Experience Report, which will provide "screenshots and videos of annoying ad experiences we've identified to make it easy to find and fix the issues." Pop-ups, takeover ads and ads with auto-playing audio are all considered bad ads, according to the Coalition for Better Ads. Google confirmed a new version of Chrome will launch in 2018 that will prevent websites from showing ads "including those owned or served by Google" on sites that don't meet its standards.

While Samsung already sells the SmartThings hub capable of controlling everything from smart lighting and locks to Amazon and Google’s voice assistants, its latest release, the Samsung Connect Home, is billed as the industry’s first smart Wi-fi system to incorporate a smart devices hub as well. So what will it do? First, the smart Wi-Fi router and system finds optimal signal coverage for the whole home (you can cover up to 4,500 square feet by connecting three hubs) and the corresponding app lets you control network access from a phone or tablet. Add in the existing SmartThings platform and you’ll be able to use the same app (or by voice command if voice assistants are integrated) to manage all of your compatible smart home devices. The product will be available as a single pack for $169.99 and three pack for $379.99. Pre-orders start on June 4 through Best Buy’s website, and will be widely available on July 16.

The team reinvented Android navigation buttons with Pie controls, offered a multi-window mode years before Google officially supported the feature, reimagined multitasking on Android devices, and started (and killed) a bunch of other projects in the meantime. But Paranoid Android has been pretty quiet over the past few years. Some of the lead developers were hired by OnePlus and left the team. And when a new ROM finally launched last year… it was pretty much just stock Android 6.0 with a handful of tweaks. But now Paranoid is back… again. And this time they’ve got an up-to-date operating system that merges some old features with some new Android goodies. xda-developers Paranoid Android 2017 Nougat Resurrection includes a new version of Pie controls designed to match Google’s Material Design, support for gesture controls (like drawing letters on the screen to launch an app, or double-tapping to wake),  an immersive mode for running any app in a full-screen view (with the notification bar hidden out of sight), and a new feature called Color Engine which is basically a theming tool that lets you choose from light, dark, and black modes and set accent colors. You can also customize the navigation buttons, battery icon, and other features. And the Android 7.1.2-based ROM is also said to offer “various performance and battery improvements.” If there’s a catch, it’s that only a handful of device sare officially supported, including: Google Pixel and Pixel XL Google Nexus 5X and 6P OnePlus 3 and OnePlus 3T The team is also testing compatibility for the Google Nexus 5, Nextbit Robin, OnePlus One, OnePlus 2, and OnePlus X. One pretty cool feature: there are custom camera features for the OnePlus 3 and OnePlus 3T that allegedly offer better image quality than you get from the stock camera on those devices, as well as faster shutter speed. But I wouldn’t be surprised to see the software ported to other devices by third-party developers… or for some of those developers to start working with the Paranoid Android team, which says it’s looking for folks to help “expand our roster of supported devices.” Now that Paranoid Android’s code is up to date and there’s a new development framework in place, the plan is to start offering bug fixes and feature updates more frequently in the future. via xda-developers and Android Police Share this: Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Email Leave a Reply 3 Comments on "Paranoid Android is back with an Android 7.1.2 ROM" Login with Notify of new follow-up comments new replies to my comments Notify of new replies to this comment Notify of new replies to this comment Sort by:   newest | oldest | most voted Guest pepekraft Share On TwitterShare On Google Click to flag and open «Comment Reporting» form.

Liliputing LPX Show Mini PCs Reviews Deals Shop About Contact us Advertise on Liliputing About Liliputing Privacy Statement Google Chrome will block annoying ads by default starting next year 06/01/2017 at 6:17 PM by Brad Linder 1 Comment Ads pay for the vast majority of free content found on the web. That’s pretty much how the modern web evolved. But some ads are really annoying, potentially blocking the content you’re trying to read and probably making you less likely to have warm, fuzzy feelings about the products being advertised. For that reason, and many others, a growing number of people are using ad blockers to hide the ads found on websites. Plugins like uBlock and AdBlock Plus can do that for Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. The Opera browser even has a built-in ad blocker. And soon, so will Google Chrome. Kind of. Let’s be clear: not only do websites like this one make most of their money from advertising. So do many big internet giants like Facebook and… Google. So why would Google include an ad blocker in its own web browser? Because it doesn’t block all ads. Instead, it’s designed to only block those ads that don’t meet the Better Ads Standards set by the Coalition for Better Ads. Basically, that means ads that pop-up over other content on a website, automatically play audio without any user interaction, cover the page until a countdown timer ends, or cover a large part of the screen in a “sticky” format that can’t easily be removed. Starting in “early 2018,” Chrome will stop showing ads on websites that don’t meet the Better Ads Standards. Note that Google isn’t just saying Chrome will stop showing non-compliant ads. It will stop showing all ads on websites that don’t comply. So let’s get back to the original question: why would a company that makes its money from advertising start filtering out ads? There are a few good explanations: Annoying ads drive people to install ad blockers which indiscriminately hide all ads. By including a selective ad blocker in Chrome, Google might encourage people not to take a more extreme approach. Threatening to block all ads for users of the world’s most popular web browser is a pretty good way to ensure that web publishers start to comply with the standards… giving readers less reason to turn to ad blockers. Google’s own advertising networks already discourage the use of these sorts of annoying ads, so it’s not like Google’s really shooting itself in the foot too much here. Of course, part of the reason websites use those flashier, more annoying ads is because simpler ads might not generate as much revenue. If Google succeeds in discouraging websites from using those ads though, it’s possible more ad money will flow to less obtrusive ads in the future. But Google also has another option: the company is revamping its Google Contributor tool that lets website visitors pay a fee to hide Google ads from the websites they visit. In the future, Chrome users who have an ad blocker installed may see a new Funding Choices notice when visiting some websites, asking them to either enable ads or pay for a pass to remove ads on that site. Meanwhile, Google may be missing a key point: some people install third-party ad blockers because they find ads annoying or irrelevant. But over the past few years I’ve heard a lot of people complain that ads are also problematic for other reasons. Some folks worry about privacy matters that come from ads that track your data. Others worry about security issues associated with ads that can deliver code to your computer (and there have been instances where malware is distributed through ads). And there’s also the fact that ads consume internet bandwidth and computer resources. So I suspect that even if Google’s new plan to start blocking ads does slow the adoption of third-party ad blockers… there will still be a large number of people who opt for the more powerful solution. Note: In case it wasn’t abundantly clear already, Liliputing is ad-supported. We do our best to ensure that our ads aren’t obtrusive, and glancing at the Better Ads Standards, it looks like we already comply, although I’ll be keeping an eye on Google’s new ad Experience Report tool to see if Google catches any problems.  But if you’re already using an ad blocker and want to help support the site, please consider making a contribution to our Patreon campaign.  Share this: Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Email Leave a Reply 1 Comment on "Google Chrome will block annoying ads by default starting next year" Login with Notify of new follow-up comments new replies to my comments Notify of new replies to this comment Notify of new replies to this comment Sort by:   newest | oldest | most voted Guest QWERTY Share On TwitterShare On Google Click to flag and open «Comment Reporting» form.

Autoplay is annoying, but it doesn’t really compare to ransomware. Chrome was one of the first to sandbox flash. It’s probably harder to sandbox the maelstrom of cross site scripting that controls every element today, but it ought to be done with only very limited content allowed to actually reach your machine.

The warning is meant to let websites assess their ads and strip any particularly disruptive ones from their pages. That’s because Chrome’s ad blocker won’t block all ads from the web. Instead, it’ll only block ads on pages that are determined to have too many annoying or intrusive advertisements, like videos that autoplay with sound or interstitials that take up the entire screen. Sridhar Ramaswamy, the executive in charge of Google’s ads, writes in a blog post that even ads “owned or served by Google” will be blocked on pages that don’t meet Chrome’s guidelines. “All content creators ... can continue to have a sustainable way to fund their work.” Instead of an ad “blocker,” Google is referring to the feature as an ad “filter,” according to The Wall Street Journal, since it will still allow ads to be displayed on pages that meet the right requirements. The blocker will work on both desktop and mobile. Google is providing a tool that publishers can run to find out if their sites’ ads are in violation and will be blocked in Chrome. Unacceptable ads are being determined by a group called the Coalition for Better Ads, which includes Google, Facebook, News Corp, and The Washington Post as members. Google shows publishers which of their ads are considered disruptive. Image: Google The feature is certain to be controversial. On one hand, there are huge benefits for both consumers and publishers. But on the other, it gives Google immense power over what the web looks like, partly in the name of protecting its own revenue. First, the benefits: bad ads slow down the web, make the web hard and annoying to browse, and have ultimately driven consumers to install ad blockers that remove all advertisements no matter what. A world where that continues and most users block all ads looks almost apocalyptic for publishers, since nearly all of your favorite websites rely on ads to stay afloat. (The Verge, as you have likely noticed, included.) By implementing a limited blocking tool, Google can limit the spread of wholesale ad blocking, which ultimately benefits everyone. Users get a better web experience. And publishers get to continue using the ad model that’s served the web well for decades — though they may lose some valuable ad units in the process. There’s also a good argument to be made that stripping out irritating ads is no different than blocking pop ups, which web browsers have done for years, as a way to improve the experience for consumers. Google, an ad company, is determining ad standards for everyone But there are drawbacks to building an ad blocker into Chrome: most notably, the amount of power it gives Google. Ultimately, it means Google gets to decide what qualifies as an acceptable ad (though it’s basing this on standards set collectively by the Coalition for Better Ads). That’s a good thing if you trust Google to remain benign and act in everyone’s interests. But keep in mind that Google is, at its core, an ad company. Nearly 89 percent of its revenue comes from displaying ads. The Chrome ad blocker doesn’t just help publishers, it also helps Google maintain its dominance. And it advantages Google’s own ad units, which, it’s safe to say, will not be in violation of the bad ad rules. This leaves publishers with fewer options to monetize their sites. And given that Chrome represents more than half of all web browsing on desktop and mobile, publishers will be hard pressed not to comply. Google will also include an option for visitors to pay websites that they’re blocking ads on, through a program it’s calling Funding Choices. Publishers will have to enable support for this feature individually. But Google already tested a similar feature for more than two years, and it never really caught on. So it’s hard to imagine publishers seeing what’s essentially a voluntary tipping model as a viable alternative to ads. Ramaswamy says that the goal of Chrome’s ad blocker is to make online ads better. “We believe these changes will ensure all content creators, big and small, can continue to have a sustainable way to fund their work with online advertising,” he writes. And what Ramaswamy says is probably true: Chrome’s ad blocker likely will clean up the web and result in a better browsing experience. It just does that by giving a single advertising juggernaut a whole lot of say over what’s good and bad.

BUSINESS Tesla's Elon Musk and Disney's Robert Iger quit Trump advisory councils, citing climate change Musk, the chief executive of both Tesla and SpaceX, is an advocate of alternative energy. Musk, the chief executive of both Tesla and SpaceX, is an advocate of alternative energy. Russ MitchellContact Reporter Tesla’s Elon Musk and Disney’s Robert Iger both said they were resigning from White House advisory councils after President Trump announced Thursday that he is withdrawing the United States from the Paris climate accord. Along with those two chief executives, other pillars of corporate America — including Google’s chief executive and Amazon.com — joined a growing chorus of disapproval over Trump’s decision. “Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world,” Musk tweeted. Musk, the CEO of both Tesla and SpaceX, had warned Wednesday that he would quit the two councils he was on if Trump pulled out of the climate agreement. Musk said he had “done all I can" — as a member of the advisory councils, through White House personnel and directly with the president — to push Trump to stick with the Obama-era plan. He later tweeted about China’s commitment under the climate accord; among that country’s goals is to get 20% of its energy from renewable sources by 2030. Musk has been an outspoken advocate of alternative energy. His electric car company Tesla also makes solar panels and high-capacity batteries. Musk was criticized when he agreed to serve on Trump’s panels on business and manufacturing, but he said he thought his presence could have a positive effect. “I believe at this time that engaging on critical issues will on balance serve the greater good,” he said at the time. Hours after Musk pulled out, Iger — who with Musk was on Trump’s business advisory panel — said he was leaving that council “as a matter of principle.” At Disney's shareholder meeting in March, Iger defended his decision to be involved with the council, saying he wanted to be "in the room where it happens." When one shareholder criticized his relationship with Trump, calling it a tacit endorsement of the president's policies, Iger said the council gives members an opportunity to express opinions to the president that Trump otherwise might not hear. "I made a decision I thought was in the best interest of our company and the industry," Iger said at the time. "I think it's a privileged opportunity to be in the room." Iger did not attend either of the two meetings the council has had so far — citing scheduling conflicts — but he told CNBC’s Julia Boorstin last month that he was in touch with the Trump administration. A Democrat who supported Hillary Clinton in the presidential election, Iger was the only entertainment executive in the business advisory council. Iger has avoided directly criticizing Trump, but he previously made a veiled criticism of his immigration policies. At the shareholder meeting in March, Iger said he is against policies that single out particular religious groups, a reference to the Trump administration's moves that some have said discriminate against Muslims. “I happen to believe this company has benefited over the years in so many different ways, as has this country, [because of] an open and fair and just immigration policy,” Iger said at the time. “We are who we are as a country because of great immigration.” General Electric CEO Jeff Immelt, a member of Trump’s council on manufacturing, also tweeted his disapproval of Trump’s choice to exit the climate change pact Thursday. Immelt has been a vocal critic of Trump on the climate change issue. In an internal memo to employees obtained by Politico, he wrote: “We believe climate change should be addressed on a global basis through multi-national agreements, such as the Paris Agreement. We hope that the United States continues to play a constructive role in furthering solutions to these challenges, and at GE, we will continue to lead with our technology and actions.” Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google Inc., expressed a similar sentiment. Google is among the two dozen companies that signed an open letter last month urging Trump to keep the U.S. in the climate accord. Richard Branson, founder of the Virgin Group, said on Bloomberg Television, “It makes me want to cry that a great country like America is abandoning its duty.” “It’s a sad day for Americans, it’s a sad day for the world, it’s a sad day for our grandchildren,” Branson said. “And obviously as business people we have to pick ourselves up on a global basis and just get on and try to sort the problem out ourselves with the other 193 countries around the world.” Amazon.com Inc. also weighed in to support the Paris deal, pushing back against the idea that climate-change policies are bad for business. “We believe that robust clean energy and climate policies can support American competitiveness, innovation, and job growth,” the e-commerce giant said in a string of tweets. “We remain committed to putting our scale and inventive culture to work in ways that are good for the environment and our customers.” And Lloyd Blankfein, the CEO of Goldman Sachs, condemned Trump's move — doing so in his first-ever tweet.

Though many voices around the world, including politicians and representatives from numerous corporations and countries, have expressed extreme concern over Trump’s decision, Pichai, Nadella, and Zuckerberg are three of the most powerful figures in the tech. Their opinions on political matters carry immense weight in the industry, suggesting many other members in Silicon Valley and beyond will speak up on behalf of the tech sector. Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk also confirmed today on Twitter that he would be stepping down from Trump’s economic advisory councils over the decision. Pichai, Nadella, and Zuckerberg are three of the industry’s most influential voices “Withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement is bad for the environment, bad for the economy, and it puts our children's future at risk,” Zuckerberg wrote on his personal Facebook page. “For our part, we've committed that every new data center we build will be powered by 100 percent renewable energy. Stopping climate change is something we can only do as a global community, and we have to act together before it's too late.” Shortly after 5PM ET, Pichai tweeted, “Disappointed with today’s decision. Google will keep working hard for a cleaner, more prosperous future for all.” Slightly early in the afternoon, Nadella and Brad Smith, the company’s chief legal officer, both tweeted messages reiterating Microsoft’s commitment to reducing carbon emissions and preventing the devastating effects of climate change. “We believe climate change is an urgent issue that demands global action. We remain committed to doing our part,” Nadella wrote. Disappointed with today’s decision. Google will keep working hard for a cleaner, more prosperous future for all.— Sundar Pichai (@sundarpichai) June 1, 2017 Smith, who is known for penning lengthy and thorough blog posts on controversial political topics on behalf of Microsoft, also directed readers to a LinkedIn post that better explained the company’s reasoning for denouncing the withdrawal. “We are disappointed with today’s decision by the White House to withdraw the United States from the landmark, globally supported Paris Agreement on climate change,” Smith writes. “We believe that continued U.S. participation benefits U.S. businesses and the economy in important and multiple ways. A global framework strengthens competitiveness for American businesses. It creates new markets for innovative clean technologies, from green power to smart grids to cloud-enabled solutions. And by strengthening global action over time, the Agreement reduces future climate damage to people and organizations around the world.” Though Musk and the others remain the most prominent tech industry leaders to have personally voiced concern on the subject, other tech companies have been issuing statements denouncing Trump’s decision as well. Both Amazon and HP issued statements saying they will continue to support the agreement and to take actions to reduce emissions and mitigate the effects of climate change. “Climate change is one of the most significant and urgent issues facing business and society today,” wrote HP in its statement. “The science is clear, the impacts are serious and the need to act is essential.” Here's Amazon's reaction to Trump pulling out of Paris Accords: pic.twitter.com/Mw2pwV49EF— Charlie Warzel (@cwarzel) June 1, 2017 Prior to Trump’s press conference today, tech leaders across the industry attempted to sway the president from following through on the withdrawal. Among those were Apple CEO Tim Cook, who called the White House on Tuesday to reportedly ask Trump to reconsider. A number of other companies signed a letter that was published today as a full-page ad in both The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times expressing the same concern. According to Axios, Cook sent an email to to Apple employees today confirming his attempt on Tuesday to convince Trump to remain part of the accord. “Climate change is real and we all share a responsibility to fight it. I want to reassure you that today's developments will have no impact on Apple's efforts to protect the environment,” Cook wrote in the email. “Our mission has always been to leave the world better than we found it. We will never waver, because we know that future generations depend on us.” Many corporate leaders like Cook tried, and apparently failed, to appeal to Trump’s nationalistic tendencies. They do so by trying to reiterate the damage the withdrawal could do to America’s business interests, as well as its ability to compete on the global stage with the nearly 200 other members of the Paris climate deal. Despite those efforts, Trump is now following through with his promise to try and renegotiate the agreement, a task some EU countries have already said is virtually impossible.

There are dozens upon dozens of features that everyone wants, so features are added over time. However, one thing that seems pretty obvious, if you ask me at least, is setting reminders. For whatever reason, though, both Amazon’s Echo and Google Home completely missed out on this feature, but now Amazon is adding it. The best gifts for Android users Starting today, Amazon Echo owners will have the ability to use their Alexa assistant to easily set reminders just with their voices. Simply tell the device something along the lines of “Alexa, remind me to take out the trash at 5 pm” or “Alexa, remind me to call John on June 5th” and you’ll get an audible alert when that time has come. It’s a simple addition, but one that will certainly come in handy quite often. Google Home users, on the other hand, still only have the hope that this same feature is on its way. Google confirmed at I/O earlier this month that reminders are coming, but the company gave no time frame for that. While implementing reminders for Google Home will be great even if similar to Amazon’s simple method, Google definitely has the ability to one-up this feature by allowing the same reminder to push through smartphones, tablets, and the Chrome browser just like current reminders via Google Assistant can. Along with reminders, Echo users are also getting the ability to set custom names to timers. To see all reminders/named timers, users can simply open the Alexa application on their Android or iOS device and navigate to the “Alerts and Alarms” section of the app. Ben Schoon @NexusBen Ben is a writer for 9to5Google who can also be found over on the 9to5Google YouTube channel and on Twitter @NexusBen.

This is a result of an improved voice recognition software by Google that nears human-level accuracy. According to Mary Meeker, an analyst from KPCB, Googles engine reached 95% accurate recognition, which is a level identical to humans. The recognition rate jumped 20% in four years and will continue to go up since Google now has voice recognition even in Google Translate and the company will keep collecting and analyzing voice data. The analyst also shared statistics that voice is beginning to replace typing in online queries, with 20% of entries made via voice last year. Meeker said that even if the internet growth is slowing globally, in India the users of the worldwide web grew more than 28% in 2016. There is room for even bigger improvement since less than a third of Indian people have access to the internet, or about 27%.

By giving publishers advance notice, Google hopes to get them to adapt less intrusive advertising formats. The company is also offering publishers affected by ad blockers another way to monetize their content. “t’s far too common that people encounter annoying, intrusive ads on the web—like the kind that blare music unexpectedly, or force you to wait 10 seconds before you can see the content on the page,” wrote Google ads and commerce SVP Sridhar Ramaswamy in a blog post Thursday. “These frustrating experiences can lead some people to block all ads—taking a big toll on the content creators, journalists, web developers and videographers who depend on ads to fund their content creation. We believe online ads should be better.” Google plans to add its ad blocker to both the desktop and mobile versions of Chrome next year. However, unlike other ad blockers, Google’s goal isn’t to filter out all advertising. The software will instead remove advertising formats that have been deemed unacceptable by the Coalition for Better Ads, a trade group that counts tech companies like Google and Facebook, but also media companies like News Corp. and the Washington Post among its members. Some of these ad formats include auto-playing video ads with sound, pop-up ads and ads that take over more than 30 percent of a mobile screen. Google also isn’t the only browser maker to enable ad blocking. Apple tweaked its Safari browser back in 2015 to allow iPhone users to install third-party ad blockers, many of which filter out advertising altogether. Google will now give publishers affected by these all-or-nothing ad blockers a new way to monetize their content: Publishers will be able to encourage users who have ad blockers installed to either disable them for their site, or get paid access through a new program called Google Contributor. Still, some criticize that Google may have a conflict of interest. The company’s ads run on 16.5 percent of all websites, according to data from W3Techs.com. Filtering out other ads arguably gives publishers an incentive to run more ads from Google’s ad network. What’s more, Chrome has in recent years become the most-used web browser, and is being used by 58 percent of all internet users, according to W3Counter.com.

Zeman   @phonescooper Google today rolled out new features for its Sheets spreadsheet application. Most of the new features target the desktop-based version of Sheets. For example, machine learning makes it possible to ask Sheets questions in a natural way to explore the data contained in any given document. For example, users can ask “what is the distribution of products sold?” or “what are average sales on Sundays?” and Sheets' new Explore function will help find the answers. Google also made it easier to share and/or import data from Google Docs and Google Slides. Other new features include improved keyboard shortcuts, printing previews, and chart editing. On the mobile front, the Apple iPhone and iPad will benefit from some of these improvements. Google says iPhone and iPad owners will be able to create and edits charts in a new sidebar. Mobile users will be able to select their own colors for personalization, and add trend lines to highlight data within charts. Last, iPhones and iPads will be able to create more types of charts, including 3D charts. Sheets for iOS is free to download from the iTunes App Store.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Google improves Gmail security against phisers with machine learning By Rei Padla - June 1, 2017 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter Google is adding some more security measures to Gmail to ensure that your work inbox is always safe and secure. It’s no secret that hackers and spammers abound. We don’t think they will go away anytime soon (and maybe not ever) so it is important that email providers do everything in their power so your account remains private. For companies who rely on Gmail for corporate mails and data transfer, know that Google is adding more security features. Whether you like it or not, phising threats are considered normal now. What is not normal though is if you actually fall into the trap. We can’t really blame you but to keep people from becoming victims, the Gmail team has added machine learning for phising detection, click-time warnings, and unintended external reply warnings among others. With machine learning, Gmail can help block phising and spam messages. Google is improving its processes for spam detection with the goal of higher accuracy. Gmail has integrated wwith Google Safe Browsing machine learning technologies so suspicious links and phising schemes are detected. Gmail has also started to show new warnings for employees that may prevent data loss. You will be asked first if you really want to send an email outside your domain.

This is the one to use pic.twitter.com/0Z8fUlzmHc— GoogleTrends (@GoogleTrends) May 30, 2017 June 1 (UPI) -- Google Trends released a report of the most misspelled words in each state based on search results for the phrase "how to spell." Google released the map of "America's Most Misspelled Words" in honor of the 90th Scripps National Spelling Bee, which began on Wednesday. The map compiled data from Jan. 1 to April 30, 2017 to determine which words Americans most commonly searched how to spell. Residents of California, Minnesota, New York and Kentucky struggled to spell the world "beautiful" and residents of Washington, Alabama, Maine and Michigan had difficulty with "pneumonia," making those the most commonly misspelled words. Other words that plagued people in multiple states included "schedule," "tomorrow," "maintenance" and "hallelujah." People in the state of Wisconsin regularly double-checked the spelling of their state's name, as they most commonly searched for how to spell "Wisconsin." Residents of Massachusetts had the same issue in 2016, but increased the degree of difficulty significantly in 2017 as they most commonly searched for how to spell "supercalifragilisticexpialidocious." Google Trends also experienced a spelling error of its own as the original version of the map misspelled "ninety," the most commonly searched word in Maryland, but later shared a corrected version.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Hayley Tsukayama By Hayley Tsukayama June 1 at 4:20 PM Follow @htsuka The Apple logo at a store in San Francisco's Union Square. (Eric Risberg/AP) Speculation over what Apple will do to compete in the home hub market is spinning up ahead of Apple's annual developers conference next week, where many analysts expect the company to confirm the project. And what will be the Apple home hub's distinguishing feature? It may be sound quality, according a report from Bloomberg News. The Siri-infused speaker will really focus on producing quality surround sound and may also have a feature that can measure the room it's in and adjust its sound accordingly, the report said. Although there were no details on how this room-adapting feature works, it sounds similar to one already on Sonos speakers, called Trueplay, that uses the microphone in an iOS device to measure a room. Apple declined to comment on the report. Focusing on sound quality would give Apple an advantage, particularly given its historical strength in music, if it moves to another front in its war against Google and Amazon.com. Both of those companies already have smart speakers on the market that integrate with their services, but they aren't going to challenge Bose or other high-end speaker systems. Still, it will be stiff competition. Both Google and Amazon are continually adding features to their devices and the voice assistants they house. Google, at its own developers conference, announced that its Google Home will work with more devices, thanks to a Bluetooth connection, as well as even deeper integration with its own services. And Amazon on Thursday announced that its Echo line of smart home hubs now lets users further customize their reminders and timers on the device — a small but useful update for two core uses of these devices. (Amazon chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos is the owner of The Washington Post.) Apart from focusing on sound quality, Apple will also have to find ways to leverage its own ecosystem of services — iTunes, the App Store, HomeKit, Siri and more — to convince potential buyers that its hub is right for them. It's not yet clear how Apple will do this, although Bloomberg reports that there will be “deep integration” with Apple services. However, contrary to prior reports from analysts, the Bloomberg report said Apple's home hub will not have a screen. That could mean it won't compete, as expected, with Amazon's recent Echo Look — a home hub that allows for video calling and potentially threatens Apple's FaceTime. Still, Apple has laid some groundwork in the home hub space before, by allowing some smart home devices such as lightbulbs to be controlled through its Apple TV, and prominently featuring its own apps for the living room. A smart speaker that builds on what Apple TV has offered would give users more flexibility to decide where to place their home hub. business technology the-switch true Please provide a valid email address.

Name: Subject: Message: Google can now understand language with 95% accuracy Newsby Edgar Cervantes9 hours ago 9 228 11 Mary Meeker’s yearly Internet Trends Report can tell us plenty of what’s going on in the interwebs. Smartphone growth is slowing down, live TV is dying, internet usage is booming in India, and Netflix is all the hype. That is all to be expected, but there is one piece of information that really impressed us. Apparently Google is now able to understand language with a 95% accuracy, rivaling human beings. Google’s jump from 80% in 2013 is credited to the search giant’s algorithms, which allow these services to learn as more users continue to utilize voice actions. Either these statistics are flawed or I am a horrible speaker, but I swear about 30% of the time Google Home has no idea what the heck I’m saying. But hey, I am not here to refute Mary’s arguments. After all, she does have all the numbers. The truth is it is still impressive we can ask a robot to tell us about the weather, traffic or that joke I wake up to on a daily basis. And it can respond intelligently (at least most of the time). See also: Google Home review – the future of the home? November 18, 2016 So let’s assume Google can understand us as well as the next door neighbor. Where do we go from now? Well, we can still tell the digital assistant is… a digital assistant. The next step is fooling humans into thinking they are speaking to another person. Author Ray Kurzweil is working with Google to make chatbots, and he claims artificial intelligence should be able to pass the Turing test by 2029. This means people wouldn’t be able to differentiate it from human speech. Crazy, right? Do hit the comments if you agree with me. Do you think Google can really understand us with a 95% accuracy? I don’t think that’s the case, at least in my experience. News Google Google  KPCB  Recode Edgar Cervantes Edgar Cervantes has over 5 years of experience in tech journalism.

Digital Trends Home > Computing > Google uses ‘Wonder Woman’ to inspire… Google uses ‘Wonder Woman’ to inspire next generation of female programmers By Adam Ismail — Updated June 1, 2017 6:37 am Subscribe Share Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you The tech industry still suffers from an overwhelming lack of diversity, and programs like this one could help change that in the future. A recent study co-published by Google and Gallup states that just 48 percent of girls between seventh and 12th grade are “very confident” they could learn computer science, compared to 65 percent of boys. An International Game Developers Survey from 2014 estimated that although the percentage of female game developers had more than doubled since 2009, women still only represented less than a quarter of the industry. Clearly there’s an imbalance that has pervaded the field. And although tech companies have made strides in terms of representation, there’s still much work ahead. Even Google, it must be said, has come under fire in recent years for failing to do enough to fix the lack of diversity within its walls — especially where equal pay is concerned. And that brings us to this week. On Friday, Wonder Woman hits theaters, and Google is using the opportunity to take action. The company has developed an interactive coding project to introduce girls to the fundamentals of the trade. The experience will allow budding programmers to recreate three unique scenes from the movie. Meanwhile, the DC Legends mobile RPG available through the Play Store has been updated with new missions where gamers can play as Wonder Woman. The coding project is being headed up by Made With Code, Google’s initiative to empower young women to pursue careers in computer science — whether they have some tech know-how or none at all. It will be accompanied by an advance screening of the film, where 100 teen girls from the Los Angeles area will be invited to see Wonder Woman before getting the opportunity to try the programming experience for themselves. Google is hoping that by helping girls become acquainted with the basics, it can chip away at societal norms and stereotypes that push women away from technical industries like computer science. A great deal of the pressure is exerted at home and in schooling — so much so that Made With Code concludes “encouragement from adults and peers is the No. 1 contributor to a teen girl’s decision to pursue computer science.” Those interested can visit Made With Code to explore other projects similar to the Wonder Woman one. Additionally, parents and teachers can use the site’s resources to discover ways to introduce programming to the young women in their lives.

Google has a plan to block ads inside Chrome, which could mean big problems for media companies, but it has a plan to soften the blow. The company won't just flip a switch and leave publishers out in the cold. Instead, Google will give publishers a 6-month lead time to get things in order, according to The Wall Street Journal. Publishers will have access to a new tool that'll let them know whether or not their ads are deemed unacceptable by the Coalition for Better Ads. The move may end up hurting smaller sites that rely on lower-quality ads the most, since those types of ads are more prevalent on sites that don't generate as much traffic as much larger publishers. The Coalition for Better Ads' website identifies both desktop and mobile web ads that it deems unacceptable for end-user experiences. show chapters Google assistant is ‘definitely useful’, says director    22 Hours Ago | 01:44 The unacceptable list includes pop-ups, ads that auto-play with sound, ads that appear before the homepage loads, and large sticky ads on the desktop. On mobile, it expands the unacceptable ads to include full-screen scrollover ads, flashing animated ads and ad density higher than 30 percent. Alphabet relies heavily on Google's ad business, which generated $21.4 billion in revenue during the first quarter of 2017. Google's move is likely to encourage Chrome users to turn off existing ad blockers, allowing a larger percentage of high-quality ads to still present themselves. In turn, that might increase Google's ever-important click-through rate. Google hasn't yet said exactly when the new ad filter will launch in Chrome, but it's expected next year. A Google spokesperson was not immediately available for comment.

The European Commission's decision will come after a seven-year investigation into the world's most popular internet search engine triggered by scores of complaints from both U.S. and European rivals. The EU competition authority accused Google in April 2015 of distorting internet search results to favour its shopping service, harming both rivals and consumers. The Commission and Google declined to comment. The U.S. company has in the past rejected the charges, saying that regulators ignored competition from online retailers Amazon and eBay Inc. Fines for companies found guilty of breaching EU antitrust rules can reach 10 percent of their global turnover, which in Google's case could be about $9 billion of its 2016 turnover. Apart from the fine, the Commission will tell Google to stop its alleged anti-competitive practices but it is not clear what measures it will order the company to adopt to ensure that rivals get equal treatment in internet shopping results. The regulator could set out general principles or specific instructions for Google to follow, said an observer. The Commission's tough line is in sharp contrast with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission which settled its own web search case with the company in 2013 by requiring Google to stop "scraping" reviews and other data from rival websites for its own products. Google made three unsuccessful attempts to settle the case with the previous European Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia in a bid to stave off a possible fine and a finding of wrongdoing. Almunia's successor Margrethe Vestager, however, has shown no willingness to settle with Google. The company has also been charged with using its Android mobile operating system to squeeze out rivals and with blocking competitors in online search advertising related to its "AdSense for Search" platform.

Gboard v6.3 enables search suggestions in the Google app and widget for some Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/06/01 9:32am PDTJun 1, 2017 36 Plus 1 on G+ 60 Share on Facebook 41 Share on Twitter Total Shares137 Applications News Google dropped a new version of Gboard last night, which includes a number of cool improvements to search. Some people are reporting another interesting feature in the form of Google search suggestions int he Google app and widget. Not everyone seems to have this, though. On older versions of Gboard, the keyboard's suggestion bar disappears when doing a search. That's still what it looks like for myself and most other AP staff after the update to v6.3. However, we've heard from a not insignificant number of people who are seeing the suggestion bar. This appears when searching via the Google widget and within the Google app. It seems to work just like the suggestion bar elsewhere. Start typing, and the keyboard guesses what word you might want to use next based on your typing history and the power of Google's prediction engine. Just grab the new version of Gboard and open a search to see if you've got it. Download QR-Code Gboard - the Google Keyboard Developer: Google Inc.

I think they accidentally pushed out the dogfood version. mike shwilly Somehow the suggestions/corrections bar doesn't even appear for me on menus like that. Anyone got a clue? https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/fcf5ae1af260f403d6fe67b4a16960601a0f678f624415845c966be49de6c152.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/7db6affa5d2544f41d448de7188c46494be0ca138cb1088830fd557174531b65.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/0729dbe9f8f2b6951428091c0dc20c66822aa0bd1fb3d8c8198fba4181bd896a.png Artem Russakovskii That's the mystery - I'm not seeing suggestions either, but many are. mike shwilly I think i had this problem since Nexus 5. It has always been really annoying. Suicide_Note Deftones are a terrible band. Hurricane Andrew I still do not see it on my S7 Edge. I wonder if launcher choice makes a difference. I use Action Launcher. Would be interesting to know what launcher people who are and are not seeing this are using. Yuri Vidal on my s7 it works. are you a beta tester? i also dont use touchwiz launcher. the suggestion bar works for me on chrome, and on google app too. jkl888 I see the suggestions on my phone Artem Russakovskii I'm on the Pixel Launcher, tried both Google app 7.2 and 7.3, and Gboard 6.2 and 6.3, and I don't have this. Reply and post your launcher, Google App version, and Gboard version, and whether you have suggestions or not. Armando Rodriguez Have you notice that the "short" height is shorter than previous versions? abqnm Are you on an S8 or G6? They tweaked some proportions on the odd aspect ratio devices. The S8 doesn't have the hugely tall spacebar anymore, which may be why it seems that way. If you're not on one of those I'm not sure as it seems the same to me. Armando Rodriguez Nexus 5 DPI at 420 Raz Have it. Nova Beta, GBoard 6.3.15.157483061-arm64-v8a, Google app 7.3.19.21.arm64. The new GBoard just asked for access to my SMS to improve the suggestions. Bruno Logerfo wait since when there's a dark theme for the google widget? João Ricardo He problaby has a theme kervation I am using a Google Pixel XL with the stock pixel launcher, running Google app version 7.3.19.21 & Google Gboard version 6.3.15.157483061. I have the suggestion bar for the Google app and also the Chrome beta browser and regular Chrome browser. I also have search suggestions show up when typing in the Google app. JATIN BANSAL I think this is also new. Earlier in dark themes, they used to have a white glow around emoji but now it is gone. I like it now https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/c8bcc901c9f60b97c05dc467df6fa4838f96cabcfbf6421714f5ec7189958205.png roberto.elena I wished the keyboard had a dynamic theme that would change automatically based on the app being used, like the status bar does: Youtube = red, WhatsApp = green, Facebook = blue, etc. thegrau There's a third party keyboard that does exactly that. Can't remember the name, but I believe it's based on AOSP Yuri Vidal chroma keyboard Łukasz Ordon There is also Xposed module that can do that... I used to use it but the framework is not available for 7.0+ yet... Adriannacsmith Google is paying 97$ per hour!

Lexster Okay, but...when will they put a freaking space after punctuation? It's not that difficult, but after using Swiftkey, I really can't get used to having to put a space after punctuation. catalysto I would NOT want that. Don't need my OCD flaring up with unnecessary spaces. Though, sure, it should probably be an option. Lexster How are spaces after periods of sentences unnecessary? hype67 In acronyms, when the dot doesn't denote the end of a sentence. As decimals. Others situations I can't remember off the top of my head. Lexster USe acronyms with periods a lot, do you? I can't remember the last time I did. It's not generally required for acronyms. You put FBI, not F. B. I. But, yes, it's a little annoying with decimals, but that can generally be programmed to recognize if the space isn't needed. Swiftkey often does. It misses sometimes, sure, but usually works well. If a field needs an IP address, it usually knows this and doesn't put a space. And yes, it can be annoying with website names, but it's much easier to backspace every once in awhile than have to hit space after every single period or question mark. Łukasz Ordon Just press space twice :P It puts full stop AND a space after it... Lexster Yes, but I prefer having the space after punctuation. Doesn't require two taps of the space bar. And it only enters periods. Łukasz Ordon Oh well... You can't make everyone happy... Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Typing URLs and email addresses is a giant pain in SwiftKey. catalysto When it's the last sentence. Lexster Okay? Well, it doesn't add a space until you type a letter, so if it's the last sentence, there wouldn't be a space unless you typed something else. catalysto A period does not always signify the end of a sentence though. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman So glad it doesn't do that. One of the worst things in SwiftKey. Typing URLs and email addresses was such a giant pain in the ass. Hitting space after I type a period isn't a big deal to me AT ALL. Especially since I'm used to typing on a keyboard anyway, so do it automatically. ozzyager I do see suggestions when doing a search. I also recieved the dog bone version first, before being updated again shortly thereafter. Maybe just a coincidence? catalysto Same thing happened to me. It's still working after updating to the non-beta version, too. Though I'm in the beta program for Gboard, so maybe that has something to do with it? My version number is 6.3.15.157483061-arm64-v8a, in case anyone is curious. Łukasz Ordon That Gboard app version with dog paw should not be released publicly. It indicates 'dogfood' version (as googlers call it) which should be tested only inside Google. Dogfood is just debug version of normal app (don't quote me on that tho) ozzyager Correct. This is why I wondered if there was any connection between that version being released by accident to some, like myself, and only some seeing the suggestions when doing a search. Of course it might just be a server side update that is being tested, etc. Łukasz Ordon I've myself got dogfood version but shortly after (like 5 mins later) I've received another update with normal apk... Armv7 version btw :p roberto.elena It also gives suggestions in Chrome while in incognito mode. abqnm While that may be unwanted, it should be pointed out that it now gives suggestions in the Chrome address bar. Period. Previously it did not suggest anything at all in the Chrome address bar, incognito or no. I still don't have it in search though. It does work when typing to Assistant, but it may have done that previously. boop Can someone explain the nav bar in the second pic? Łukasz Ordon It's probably Pixel phone navbar... destinyhud pixel phone if u mean the down arrow then when u click a bar the left become a down arrow boop The color, I mean Hurricane Andrew Running Action Launcher 3, Google app version 7.3.19.21, Gboard version 6.3.15.157483061 and do not have the suggestions in the search app. Łukasz Ordon Talking about Google app itself... apparently, cards in Google Now feed have new design now https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/5fbd4b5888c4ad6d684f6ab3ba7589a3354607b05f565c0b7aed404237d8d8dc.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/ed878edc7fa830f93bf49db1a7d5c8b4267ae6cada762eb9d0e723312cd72c5a.png Łukasz Ordon Aaaaand it's gone... Now cards are normal for me... Take look at football match card (I mean the 'title' of it) https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/150e49575e0870a2a9ca2cf19dd64acd4a3c720df42161667388f2bc104c7a1b.png Federico Rios Im still here with the 5.2.1 version before it called Gboard in Android O DP2 and im SO HAPPY :D whispy_snippet I've never understood why this feature hasn't always existed. Teja The word prediction is the only thing I worry about. Swiftkey is way better than Gboard which made me to switch back to Swiftkey. Michael Oghia Does anyone else experience problems with the spell check feature? Sometimes I misspell a word, it tells me it's misspelled, but then doesn't offer any suggestions. It used to work better a few years ago (when it was still just keyboard or whatever it was called). Vratislav Jindra I would swear I had this yesterday. Today it disappeared.

Google improves art searches with high-resolution images, interactive knowledge panels, and more Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/05/31 8:54am PDTMay 31, 2017 17 Plus 1 on G+ 29 Share on Facebook 42 Share on Twitter Total Shares88 Google News Videos Google says people like art, and it would know. There are more than 500 million art-related searches on Google every month. The team from Google Arts & Culture got together with the search team to make these results more than just a list of images and Wikipedia links. Now, you'll see high-resolution collections, knowledge panels, better indoor Street View experiences, and more. The improvements are split into two distinct parts. If you head over to Google and do a search for an artist or artwork, the search engine will better understand how to help you explore the topic. You get an interactive knowledge panel with information on artists, related works, and more. There are also high-resolution images that you can zoom in to get a better look at. Google Street View is also getting some more art-friendly features. Specifically, the indoor Street View museum experiences. Google used machine learning to scan the walls of participating museums and identify works of art. When wandering through these places on the web and mobile app, you will see handy annotations next to each piece. Clicking on them takes you to a new page with more info and high-resolution images for zooming in close. Both these features are rolling out to users now. Keep an eye out.

The search giant has introduced an update to Gmail with features to tackle fraudulent emails, including early detection, click-time warnings for malicious links and unintended external replies and built-in defenses against new threats. The update, although available to all Gmail customers, is largely geared towards helping companies keep their data secure. Scroll down for video  Google has introduced an update to Gmail with features to tackle fraudulent emails, including early detection, click-time warnings for malicious links and unintended external replies and built-in defenses against new threats GMAIL UPDATE  Google has introduced an update to Gmail with features to tackle fraudulent emails, including early detection, click-time warnings for malicious links and unintended external replies and built-in defenses against new threats.  These new models have combined a variety of techniques such as reputation and similarity analysis on URLs, allowing Google to generate new URL click-time warnings for phishing and malware links. It also selectively delays messages to perform rigorous phishing analysis and further protect user data from compromise. Google has adding unintended external reply warnings to its email service. This feature will prevent users from accidentally sending protected data to someone outside of their company. Google has already harnessed the power of machine learning to block spam and phishing messages - 'with over 99.9 percent accuracy,' Andy Wen, senior product manager at Google claimed in an announcement. He continued to explain that about 50 to 70 percent of messages sent through Gmail are spam. 'We're continuing to improve spam detection accuracy with early phishing detection, a dedicated machine learning model that selectively delays messages (less than 0.05 percent of messages on average) to perform rigorous phishing analysis and further protect user data from compromise,' Wen explained.  The new detection models have integrated with Google Safe Browsing machine learning technologies in order to sniff out and identify potentially dangerous URLS. These new models have combined a variety of techniques such as reputation and similarity analysis on URLs, allowing Google to generate new URL click-time warnings for phishing and malware links. And the more patterns that are found, the faster the models become at finding threats. Additionally, Google is adding unintended external reply warnings to its email service.

For example, if you are set to share a confidential document to someone outside of your domain, a warning will appear underneath the recipient stating 'the recipient does not belong in your organization and is not in your list of contacts. The new detection models have integrated with Google Safe Browsing machine learning technologies in order to sniff out and identify potentially dangerous URLS PHISHING ON GMAIL  Earlier this month, a malicious email wreaked havoc on Gmail. Users were asked to click on the link, which ultimate gives the hackers behind the attack access to the contents of their Google accounts, including email, contacts and documents. Clicking the malicious link takes users to a what looks like a Google-hosted page that presents them with a list of their accounts. The page asks users to select one of their accounts and provide an app called 'Google Docs'. Once you press 'allow', the Google Docs app, which was developed by the cyber trouble makers, can now sift through your emails and contacts, allowing it to continue the infected chain-mail. Although it may seem harmless, experts warn that these hackers now have access to your Google account and any personal information inside.  'Be careful with sensitive information'. However, Wen explained that the AI is capable of decipher between who is or is not someone who you interact with regularly. 'Security threats are constantly evolving and we're always looking for ways to help people protect their data,' Wen explained. Google is adding unintended external reply warnings to its email service. This feature will prevent users from accidentally sending protected data to someone outside of their company 'With new built-in defenses against ransomware and polymorphic malware, Gmail now blocks millions of additional emails that can harm users.' 'We classify new threats by combining thousands of spam, malware and ransomware signals with attachment heuristics (emails that could be threats based on signals) and sender signatures (already marked malware).'    Share or comment on this article e-mail Most watched News videos Three dead after two bounty hunters shoot up Nissan dealership Beefeater tells woman off for throwing glove at Royal Guard Trump announces U.S. will officially withdraw from Paris accord Catching a Killer: Documentary shows search for mother's killer Reports indicate Trump pulling US out of Paris climate deal Road rage pair kung-fu fight in middle of traffic jam in Malaga Dani Mathers apologizes for body shaming naked 70-year-old woman Jeremy Corbyn refuses to say if immigration would fall with him as PM Election 2017: The highlights from the BBC leaders' debate Timeline: Events that led to Tiger Woods' arrest suspicion of DUI Zookeeper mauled by a tiger talks about protecting the species Terrifying footage shows panic and chaos as people flee Manila hotel 'I represent the people of Pittsburgh NOT Paris': Trump...

MailOnline puts Sony's XB40 to the test Sony SRS-XB40 has a built-in multi-coloured line light, speaker lights and a flashing strobe. It features 24 hours of battery life and claims to be a 'mini-disco on the move'. But does it live up to the claim? Samsung's Galaxy S8: A hefty price tag and a dumb personal assistant Samsung's new Galaxy S8 phone is stunning, but its $100 price hike is hard to swallow. Overall the S8 is for those who want elegance - and are willing to pay for it. Affordable, robust and surprisingly responsive: Samsung's Galaxy A5 With the eagerly awaited Galaxy S8 having been pushed back, South Korea-based Samsung has plugged the gap with the Samsung Galaxy A5, a high-end device with a mid-range price tag. Is it really worth paying £280 for Nintendo's Switch? MailOnline's verdict While the design is impressive and easy to use, the game line up is disappointing. Google's Daydream: The $79 headset that could bring VR to the masses Google's $79 headset is superb in terms of hardware - but is currently let down by a lack of apps. However, it has absolutely huge potential to finally bring VR to the masses. Welcome Home: Google's $130 smart speaker Google's smart Home speaker still has a lot of learning to do, and loses out to Amazon's Echo in some areas - but has incredible potential 'Not quite an iPhone replacement': Google's Pixel phone Google's Pixel handset is good, and boasts an amazing camera and smart assistant. It's the king of the Android handsets - but still not great. Xbox One S review: Console that will make your 4K TV shine Microsoft's Xbox One S has shrunk the giant console by 40%, and is stunningly designed console with 4K HDR capabilities - but comes with some caveats. The $1,000 wireless speaker that really IS worth the price: Naim Mu-so Qb review Naim's incredible Mu-So Qb takes you back to the good old days - where the music captivates and enthralls, rather that simply being something in the background. The hi-tech $2,000 spin bike that really could change your life Peloton's hi-tech bike lets you stream live and on demand rides to your home - and it's one of the best examples of fitness technology out there - at a price. Apple's new 9.7inch iPad Pro is a powerhouse you can take anywhere Apple has added a few improvements to the smaller version, creating a tablet that is astonishingly powerful, but, unlike its big brother, is something you'll be able to carry everywhere. Speaker that looks as good as its sounds: B&W Zeppelin Wireless review It's not cheap, but the $699 (£500) Zeppelin Wireless is perfect for the design conscious music fan. The best all in one wireless speaker you'll ever hear: Naim Mu-so review It might not be a name familiar to the US market, but Naim is a legendary British brand hoping to make a splash with the American launch of its $1499 Mu:So speaker.

Look for it at WWDC next week. Apple is set to bring Siri to a standalone speaker akin to the Google Home or Amazon Echo, according to Bloomberg. Apple could announce the Siri speaker at WWDC next week, although it wouldn't be ready to ship until later this year, Bloomberg reports, citing people familiar with the matter. Although Siri first launched in 2011, long before voice assistants from Google and Amazon, users must currently interact with it via Apple's existing products, including Macs, iPhones, and the Apple TV. Giving Siri its own dedicated speaker would allow Apple to ride the more recent phenomenon of always-listening voice assistants that can perform home automation tasks—via Apple's HomeKit protocol—in addition to looking up sports scores and reading weather reports. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Related With Cortana Speaker, Microsoft Is Again Late to the Party With Cortana Speaker, Microsoft Is Again Late to the Party While the rumored Apple speaker would directly compete with the Echo and Google Home, Siri has had a rudimentary ability to constantly listen and respond to "Hey, Siri" commands since the iPhone 6s was introduced in September 2015. But that experience falls far short of what a dedicated speaker offers, since it relies on your phone's speakers and microphone to do the listening and the talking. Rumors of a Siri speaker raises the question of what Microsoft has in the works to keep its Cortana voice assistant competitive. The Cortana-powered Harman Kardon Invoke speaker is one possibility. Announced last month, the Invoke is scheduled to ship this fall. This week, Microsoft also teased a digital assistant from HP, a small puck-like speaker akin to the Amazon Echo Dot. "The new HP digital assistant featuring Cortana is a standalone personal assistant device that does not need to connect to a Windows 10 PC to provide a complete intelligent speaker experience," Microsoft said in a statement to The Verge. It's unclear when it will go on sale. Back to top Previous : Paul Allen's Massive Stratolaunch Aircraft Emerges From Hang...

Gboard v6.3 enables search suggestions in the Google app and widget for some Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/06/01 9:32am PDTJun 1, 2017 36 Plus 1 on G+ 60 Share on Facebook 41 Share on Twitter Total Shares137 Applications News Google dropped a new version of Gboard last night, which includes a number of cool improvements to search. Some people are reporting another interesting feature in the form of Google search suggestions int he Google app and widget. Not everyone seems to have this, though. On older versions of Gboard, the keyboard's suggestion bar disappears when doing a search. That's still what it looks like for myself and most other AP staff after the update to v6.3. However, we've heard from a not insignificant number of people who are seeing the suggestion bar. This appears when searching via the Google widget and within the Google app. It seems to work just like the suggestion bar elsewhere. Start typing, and the keyboard guesses what word you might want to use next based on your typing history and the power of Google's prediction engine. Just grab the new version of Gboard and open a search to see if you've got it. Download QR-Code Gboard - the Google Keyboard Developer: Google Inc.

I think they accidentally pushed out the dogfood version. mike shwilly Somehow the suggestions/corrections bar doesn't even appear for me on menus like that. Anyone got a clue? https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/fcf5ae1af260f403d6fe67b4a16960601a0f678f624415845c966be49de6c152.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/7db6affa5d2544f41d448de7188c46494be0ca138cb1088830fd557174531b65.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/0729dbe9f8f2b6951428091c0dc20c66822aa0bd1fb3d8c8198fba4181bd896a.png Artem Russakovskii That's the mystery - I'm not seeing suggestions either, but many are. mike shwilly I think i had this problem since Nexus 5. It has always been really annoying. Suicide_Note Deftones are a terrible band. Hurricane Andrew I still do not see it on my S7 Edge. I wonder if launcher choice makes a difference. I use Action Launcher. Would be interesting to know what launcher people who are and are not seeing this are using. Yuri Vidal on my s7 it works. are you a beta tester? i also dont use touchwiz launcher. the suggestion bar works for me on chrome, and on google app too. jkl888 I see the suggestions on my phone Artem Russakovskii I'm on the Pixel Launcher, tried both Google app 7.2 and 7.3, and Gboard 6.2 and 6.3, and I don't have this. Reply and post your launcher, Google App version, and Gboard version, and whether you have suggestions or not. Armando Rodriguez Have you notice that the "short" height is shorter than previous versions? abqnm Are you on an S8 or G6? They tweaked some proportions on the odd aspect ratio devices. The S8 doesn't have the hugely tall spacebar anymore, which may be why it seems that way. If you're not on one of those I'm not sure as it seems the same to me. Armando Rodriguez Nexus 5 DPI at 420 Raz Have it. Nova Beta, GBoard 6.3.15.157483061-arm64-v8a, Google app 7.3.19.21.arm64. The new GBoard just asked for access to my SMS to improve the suggestions. Bruno Logerfo wait since when there's a dark theme for the google widget? João Ricardo He problaby has a theme kervation I am using a Google Pixel XL with the stock pixel launcher, running Google app version 7.3.19.21 & Google Gboard version 6.3.15.157483061. I have the suggestion bar for the Google app and also the Chrome beta browser and regular Chrome browser. I also have search suggestions show up when typing in the Google app. JATIN BANSAL I think this is also new. Earlier in dark themes, they used to have a white glow around emoji but now it is gone. I like it now https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/c8bcc901c9f60b97c05dc467df6fa4838f96cabcfbf6421714f5ec7189958205.png roberto.elena I wished the keyboard had a dynamic theme that would change automatically based on the app being used, like the status bar does: Youtube = red, WhatsApp = green, Facebook = blue, etc. thegrau There's a third party keyboard that does exactly that. Can't remember the name, but I believe it's based on AOSP Yuri Vidal chroma keyboard Łukasz Ordon There is also Xposed module that can do that...

Lexster Okay, but...when will they put a freaking space after punctuation? It's not that difficult, but after using Swiftkey, I really can't get used to having to put a space after punctuation. catalysto I would NOT want that. Don't need my OCD flaring up with unnecessary spaces. Though, sure, it should probably be an option. Lexster How are spaces after periods of sentences unnecessary? hype67 In acronyms, when the dot doesn't denote the end of a sentence. As decimals. Others situations I can't remember off the top of my head. Lexster USe acronyms with periods a lot, do you? I can't remember the last time I did. It's not generally required for acronyms. You put FBI, not F. B. I. But, yes, it's a little annoying with decimals, but that can generally be programmed to recognize if the space isn't needed. Swiftkey often does. It misses sometimes, sure, but usually works well. If a field needs an IP address, it usually knows this and doesn't put a space. And yes, it can be annoying with website names, but it's much easier to backspace every once in awhile than have to hit space after every single period or question mark. Łukasz Ordon Just press space twice :P It puts full stop AND a space after it... Lexster Yes, but I prefer having the space after punctuation. Doesn't require two taps of the space bar. And it only enters periods. Łukasz Ordon Oh well... You can't make everyone happy... Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Typing URLs and email addresses is a giant pain in SwiftKey. catalysto When it's the last sentence. Lexster Okay? Well, it doesn't add a space until you type a letter, so if it's the last sentence, there wouldn't be a space unless you typed something else. catalysto A period does not always signify the end of a sentence though. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman So glad it doesn't do that. One of the worst things in SwiftKey. Typing URLs and email addresses was such a giant pain in the ass. Hitting space after I type a period isn't a big deal to me AT ALL. Especially since I'm used to typing on a keyboard anyway, so do it automatically. ozzyager I do see suggestions when doing a search. I also recieved the dog bone version first, before being updated again shortly thereafter. Maybe just a coincidence? catalysto Same thing happened to me. It's still working after updating to the non-beta version, too. Though I'm in the beta program for Gboard, so maybe that has something to do with it? My version number is 6.3.15.157483061-arm64-v8a, in case anyone is curious. Łukasz Ordon That Gboard app version with dog paw should not be released publicly. It indicates 'dogfood' version (as googlers call it) which should be tested only inside Google. Dogfood is just debug version of normal app (don't quote me on that tho) ozzyager Correct. This is why I wondered if there was any connection between that version being released by accident to some, like myself, and only some seeing the suggestions when doing a search. Of course it might just be a server side update that is being tested, etc. Łukasz Ordon I've myself got dogfood version but shortly after (like 5 mins later) I've received another update with normal apk... Armv7 version btw :p roberto.elena It also gives suggestions in Chrome while in incognito mode. abqnm While that may be unwanted, it should be pointed out that it now gives suggestions in the Chrome address bar. Period. Previously it did not suggest anything at all in the Chrome address bar, incognito or no. I still don't have it in search though. It does work when typing to Assistant, but it may have done that previously. boop Can someone explain the nav bar in the second pic? Łukasz Ordon It's probably Pixel phone navbar... destinyhud pixel phone if u mean the down arrow then when u click a bar the left become a down arrow boop The color, I mean Hurricane Andrew Running Action Launcher 3, Google app version 7.3.19.21, Gboard version 6.3.15.157483061 and do not have the suggestions in the search app. Łukasz Ordon Talking about Google app itself... apparently, cards in Google Now feed have new design now https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/5fbd4b5888c4ad6d684f6ab3ba7589a3354607b05f565c0b7aed404237d8d8dc.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/ed878edc7fa830f93bf49db1a7d5c8b4267ae6cada762eb9d0e723312cd72c5a.png Łukasz Ordon Aaaaand it's gone...

Teja The word prediction is the only thing I worry about. Swiftkey is way better than Gboard which made me to switch back to Swiftkey. Michael Oghia Does anyone else experience problems with the spell check feature? Sometimes I misspell a word, it tells me it's misspelled, but then doesn't offer any suggestions. It used to work better a few years ago (when it was still just keyboard or whatever it was called). Vratislav Jindra I would swear I had this yesterday. Today it disappeared.

By Lory Gil Thursday, Jun 1, 2017 at 10:00 am EDT 17 Comments Lory is a renaissance woman, writing news, reviews, and how-to guides for iMore. She also fancies herself a bit of a rock star in her town and spends too much time reading comic books.  If she's not typing away at her keyboard, you can probably find her at Disneyland or watching Star Wars (or both). Did you just get your first iPad? Looking for the top apps to download next? Here they are! Updated May 2017: These are still the best apps you can download for your new iPad. We added OneDrive for a cloud storage option that pairs nicely with your PC, as well as Tweetbot 4 for a great social media management service. You just got your brand new iPad. You've set it up. You tried out all the built-in apps. And now you're starting at that big, beautiful screen and wondering — what's next? Well, the App Store! It's home to hundreds of thousands of iPad apps any of which can transform the screen you're holding into a new a wondrous tool or toy. Here are some great ones to get started with! Productivity Streaming media Cloud Storage Reading Writing Social media Art Shopping Music creation Games Productivity 1Password No matter what type of device you own, you are always going to need a way to keep track of the dozens of passwords you collect from apps and websites. 1Password makes it incredibly easy to store information across all of your devices so you only have to remember the one you use to unlock the app. It also works with Touch ID(iPad Pro, iPad Air 2, iPad mini 3 or later), so you can keep your passwords ultra secure. Free - Download now iWork Of course, no iPad would be complete without Apple's suite of productivity apps. With Pages, Numbers, and Keynote, you can create and edit the best files and documents around. And, if you are sharing your work with Office users, no problem. iWorks is compatible with Microsoft's counterparts. $9.99 or free on qualified devices Download Pages $9.99 or free on qualified devices Download Numbers $9.99 or free on qualified devices Download Keynote Duet Display If you plan on using your iPad as a companion to your Mac or PC, you can turn the smaller display into a second screen with Duet. Lag time is undetectable because you connect the devices using a Lightning USB cable, instead of over Wi-Fi. When the two are connected, you can drag files, browser tabs, and more to the iPad's screen. Plus, you can use your mouse, trackpad, and even touch screen gestures to interact with anything on the second screen. $ 9.99 - Download now Streaming media Netflix If you can't stream movies and shows on your big screen TV, watching them on your iPad is the next best thing. With a paid subscription to Netflix, you can access thousands of titles. If you are already a subscriber, all of your history, favorites, and queues will be waiting for your on your tablet. $7.99 - $11.99 per month Download now Hulu Similar to Netflix, Hulu gives subscribers access to thousands of TV shows and movies right on their iPad. You can watch current seasons of some of the most popular shows on television the day after they air. Plus, Hulu's exclusive content makes it worth the monthly price. If you already subscribe to Hulu, your history, favorites and queues will be available on your iPad. $7.99 - $11.99 - Download now YouTube To round out the media streaming trifecta, add YouTube for hours of homespun fun. Don't forget to subscribe to iMore to keep up to date on the latest and greatest Apple product reviews. And, of course there's always cat videos. Free - Download now Cloud Storage Dropbox If you've made the plunge into the 256 GB iPad Pro, you probably don't need to worry about storage, but for everyone else, there is Dropbox. Dropbox is a cross-platform cloud storage service that lets you keep photos, videos, documents, and more in one place. You can access your account from anywhere you have Internet access, and you can also share content with others without having to give them your personal account information. Free - Download now Google Drive If you have a Google account, you may want to look into using the Google Drive cloud service. Similar to Dropbox, you can save all manner of files, including videos and pictures. With Google Docs, you can collaborate in real-time with others, too. The only requirement is that you must be signed up with Google. Free - Download now OneDrive Microsoft's cloud storage service is also the best way to transfer data between your iPad and your PC. When you sign up, like iCloud, you get 5GB of free storage. For $2 a month, you can get 50GB, and after that, you can subscribe yearly and also get Office 365 for $70 to $100 per year. With the OneDrive app for iPad, if you have Office, you can get to work on documents right in the app, with the ability to save right in the app. Photos are automatically tagged so that you can find them easily, and you can share everything. You can even access files offline, so that you can get work done when you don't have an internet connection. If you're a PC user, OneDrive is the best cloud storage service for you. Free, subscriptions - Download now Evernote Evernote is like cloud storage extreme (with a capital "E"). Its great for taking notes and making lists, but it is also a place for saving ideas, like something you've seen on your favorite blog (or this best app list). Features include a business card scanner that turns physical contacts into digital ones, voice-to-text dictation, and the ability to collaborate on project ideas. It is your one-stop shop for creativity. Free - Download now Reading Kindle Reader Having the Kindle Reader for iOS is like having a Kindle inside of your iPad. When you purchase a book on Amazon, you can send it to your iPad directly from the website. When you open the app, it will be there, waiting for you to download. Thanks to landscape mode, reading on the iPad feels more natural. Free - Download now Overdrive Did you know that you can check out ebooks from your local library? Overdrive makes it easy to get those books onto your iPad. You can connect your local library number to check out books, read them, and even return them. You can place books on hold and get a notification when they are ready for checkout. All of this, and you don't even have to exit Overdrive. Free - Download now Comics by comiXology Comic book readers will really enjoy getting their weekly fix right on their iPad. Comixology has the largest selection of comics across all distributor including majors and indies, plus get your Manga fix without having to wait for the next Anime convention. You do have to purchase books from the ComiXology website before you can download them. Now that Amazon owns the service, all of your Kindle comics are readable in the Comics app. Free - Download now GoodReader If you have lots of documents, books, pamphlets, comics, or other items already stored on your computer, you can add them to GoodReader to take with you anywhere. You can import files from iCloud Drive, open PDFs from Safari in it, and even connect to a friend's device to share files directly. It is also a document annotator, so if you want to draw mustaches on your magazine models, go right ahead. $4.99 - Download now Writing iA Writer For bloggers and those that use plain text or Markdown to write, iA Writer is a must-have for the iPad. You can concentrate on your work by activating focus mode, use special tools to highlight such things as nouns or conjunctions, and get a preview of what your finished work should look like once it is published. The customizable keyboard lets you select specific functions you use the most, like headers, bullets, or bold font. Documents can be stored and accessed in iCloud or Dropbox for easy access across any device. Oh, and Night mode. $4.99 - Download now Day One 2 Diary + Journal + Notes Every good writer knows that journaling is how you keep your skills sharp. Day One is a streamlined digital journal app for keeping daily notes, musings, and ideas in order. You can add photos and locations to your entries and create multiple journals for different themes. For example, you could keep one journal specifically for writing song lyrics, and another for keeping track of your photography shoots. Bloom Built created an exclusive cloud storage service to keep your journal accessible across all of your devices. But, if you prefer iCloud or Dropbox, you can always use Day One Classic instead. $4.99 - Download now Notability Notability is a note-taking app that lets you handwrite your notes instead of typing them, which is fantastic for new iPad Pro owners that also have the Apple Pencil. In any given note, you can sketch, handwrite, type, cut out a section and paste it back in, and record audio that is saved with that specific note. It features palm detection, so you can write with your hand resting on your screen (the way most people handwrite) without confusing the program. $5.99 - Download now Social media Pinterest Pinterest is a social networking website for crafting, cooking, and building your dream home. It is sort of like a digital scrapbook for anything you are passionate about. The official app looks great on the iPad. You can browse through pins in your feed, search for specific topics, and see who is saving your posts. Your pins are all saved on your personal board for quick access when you want to check a recipe or see if that couch matches your lounge chair. Free - Download now Tweetbot 4 You might think that Twitter's own iOS app is perfect, and if you do, that's totally fine. But if you're a diehard Twitter user, you'll probably want something a little more robust, with better features and ways to view your feed. Tweetbot 4 lets you sync your timeline across all of your devices and puts you in control of what you see. You can mute tweets by certain users, mute hashtags, and even keywords, so that you don't get so frustrated with all the crap flying around that you just up and quit Twitter altogether. You can still do everything like you would normally — DMs, tweet, view lists — as well as a statistics view, a night theme for low-light environments, and more. If you want to keep track of how popular certain tweets are or how many followers you're gaining and losing every day, Tweetbot is invaluable. $9.99 - Download now Art Paper You may recall that iMore Managing Editor Serenity Caldwell reviewed the Apple Pencil entirely in sketch. The go-to app she uses for her amazing art is Paper. It is the perfect app for sketching out ideas, creating graphs, doodling, and more. There are also some impressive tools for taking notes and annotating images. It's an all-around useful app for sparking creativity. Free - Download now Procreate For creating full digital paintings, you'll want to step into Procreate. It has dozens of highly customizable painting and drawing tools with a wide array of color options. You can paint on top of colors and blend shades for a very realistic art experience. It also has additional digitizing features, like adjustable motion and perspective blur, color balance, and more. The project tracking feature lets you record your progress as a time lapse video that you can share with others. $5.99 - Download now Pigment If you aren't really much of an artist, but do love to express yourself with color, Pigment is a coloring book for adults that is the most realistic coloring experience on the iPad. The eight basic coloring tools range from simple crayon to airbrushing. You can freeform color and risk going outside the lines, or lock a section to ensure that your creation looks perfect. The free download comes with dozens of free illustrations, but for a weekly, monthly, or yearly subscription you get new coloring books every month. Free - Download now Shopping Amazon When it comes to online purchases, the iPad is the perfect mobile device for finding what you want. Amazon practically has every single sellable item in its online store and the mobile app makes it easy for you to find what you are looking for. You can add items to your wish list, compare items, check for daily deals, view recommended products, and of course, buy it all. If you shop on Amazon, you'll want this app on your iPad. Just be careful, shopping is so easy you might spend all of your hard-earned cash. Free - Download now eBay For reseller shopping, eBay has practically everything you can think of, plus everything else that Amazon won't sell. On your iPad, you can search for products and filter by price, ending time, and distance. You can also refine your search by sold items, condition, and auction or buy it now. View full screen photos, compare items, and bid on that vintage toy you know you shouldn't buy. Or, add it to your watch list to see just how much you could have gotten it for. Free - Download now Music creation GarageBand Whether you shred on electric guitar or drop beats on a synthesizer, GarageBand makes it easy for you to create music. You can download tracks you've recorded from another program, connect your instrument with an adapter, or capture your inspiration using a microphone. Even if you don't own a single instrument, you can create multi-track songs since GarageBand includes dozens of guitar, bass, keyboard, and drum options that you can use to create realistic sounding digital music. Once recorded, you can export your tracks to Facebook, Youtube, SoundCloud, and more. $4.99 or free on qualified devices Download now Audiobus The iPad is an incredible device for music creation. There are hundreds of apps that all do amazing things. You can lay down beats, clip loops, create synth sounds, and a whole lot more. Audiobus is like a digital pedal board for connecting music apps. You can link up compatible apps, like Animoog and SoundPrism, to combine the music they both make. Audiobus is indispensable for any iPad musician working with multiple programs. $4.99 - Download now Games Gaming is another animal (and another post) altogether! We rounded up the best games for iPad because there were just too many to list here. Check it out: Best games for iPad What do you recommend? This list focuses on a broad spectrum of apps that are a staple of owning an iPad, but there are thousands of great titles in the App Store that become favorites among iPad users. What are some of your favorite apps that you would recommend to someone brand new to the Apple ecosystem?

If someone should have bought a new device, then he (or she, of course) will know why. If someone unfamiliar with mobile gear at all should be given his first mobile device, let him first familiarize himself with this world opening up. If someone familiar with another mobile platform should be given an iOS device, let him find the way to productivity (or whatever) here. And then, if that person should start wondering "Can I do this at all on my device?" or "I need some guidance in choosing the right app for this task." - only then would that person be served by some comparison of similar apps. Comparison by features, ease of use, value for money - whatever may seem relevant. And yes, with the amount of apps available and the limitations of the App Store itself (and the tendency of many vendors to delay the purpose and features of their apps until far down in the description field), then such guidance would definitely be welcome. I may seem to suggest some forum-only approach. However, I do discover new (to me) fields of iOS apps after collecting over 3000 of them during over four years, so please do continue pointing me to things not asked. :-) -3 1 year ago Reply phreddyl You know you don't have to read the article if you don't want to- Its called free will... 0 1 year ago Reply Chris Laarman Thanks for the enlightenment! 0 1 year ago Reply smart_burro Who ****** in your Cheerios? Sent from the iMore App 0 1 year ago Reply Ninotschka Depends on what they want to use their new iPad for, doesn't it? For general use I'd agree with Kindle, 1Password, Dropbox, Evernote and Procreate, but would replace GoodReader with PDF Expert, IA Writer with 1Writer, Drafts, Byword or Ulysses and mention MS Word, Excel and PowerPoint as alternative to iWork (many people have, or have to have, Office on their Mac / PC and the iOS apps are actually pretty good). I'd also add Newsify (I wouldn't know what to do without RSS), Instapaper, Pixelmator, VSCO, Scanner Pro, 2Do, Tweetbot and Workflow and drop pretty much everything else. 1 1 year ago Reply Tech198 (umm.. that pic look very similar to... well never-mind...apart from the green R2) I would say Netflix would be mine, Hulu, Dropbox and Lastpass (and for some reason i got Adobe Photoshop elements...) Duet Display looks good 0 1 year ago Reply Uthink I think these lists are always valuable. As long as they're up to date. I remember years ago buying at least 20 different note taking apps. I really wished there was just a database engine that I could plug my desired attributes in and it could generate a short list for me. Those of us who've used iPads for a while, don't get a lot of value out of these. But even if you only see 1 app of use, it's worth the read. My humble suggestions would be...Notes Plus (Awesome note app for people who like to write more than type notes), Infinote (make idea boards with stickies), LinkedIn, OutlineCreate, Toodledo, Post-it Plus (It's like magic), AnyList (I use it for recipe sharing), HBO Go, TWITpad, Lumin, and Waze 0 1 year ago Reply Rahul Krishna1 I would Outlook for email is good Sent from the iMore App 0 1 year ago Reply tjedson "AP Mobile" and "Breaking News" for the latest breaking news notifications.

"Authy" for second factor authentication. 0 1 year ago Reply Hirisky Spark for email is on my iPhone and iPad. Tried a whole bunch of apps but seem to stick to this one. Outlook I guess comes second. Keepass has been my password manager for years. Can't have better security when you database and program are separated. I keep the database file in Dropbox so it sync across all my devices even my dust collecting BB Z30. On a daily basis my most used apps are: Spotify, Netflix, Fantastical, WP office, Paper my Hue app and Safari. 0 1 year ago Reply RupMjee Terrific list. Thanks Lory. Sent from the iMore App 0 1 year ago Reply smart_burro Duet Display is fantastic. Especially with the bigger iPad Pro. I like OneNote better than Evernote since it allows for more levels of nested folders/notebooks and handwritten notes can be added inline with typed text. The OneNote web clipper isn't as good as Evernote, but has improved significantly. Evernote also integrates better with 3rd party apps and services, but OneNote has it beat in many other areas more important to me. It's also free. For a PDF/document reader I prefer PDF Expert over Goodreader. For an Apple Mail replacement I would recommend Spark.

Best research and writing tool out there at any price. 0 12 hours ago Reply n8ter#AC Scrivener only works if you use Dropbox for your cloud service, which is probably one of the biggest blunders they've made. They should have just revamped their file format to make it work with iCloud. I have it on both macOS and iOS. I never use it, because I'm not using wires to transfer files, and I'm not opening up a Dropbox account just for ONE APP (well, technically two). For research, you can use Microsoft OneNote. Works wonders. Microsoft also has a Researcher app for iOS, which Syncs with Desktop Office's research pane. These things are far better than Scrivener for "research." Scrivener is great for compiling large, complex documents, though. However, for the average person, Ulysses is going to give them a much better UX devoid of Scrivener's overbearing complexity. Hulu and Netflix I find to be redundant if you have a Cable Package, as most Cable Providers are now letting you stream On-Demand content on Mobile Devices and PCs for free. This includes a metric ton of the same stuff available on Hulu, Netflix, and Amazon Video. They're a waste of money if you have cable. At the very least, I'd just subscribe to them for a month here and there to binge watch a few seasons of some "exclusive" series/content, and then turn them right off. All of this can be done for free from a trial account set up on a disposable email account or alias ;-) I had huge battery drain issues with VLC on my iPhone. Not sure how it works on iPad, but it certainly didn't work out too well on my phone. VSCO requires an account. If you deleted an account on your email previously, it won't let you create a new one. Something to keep in mind, for those people who don't want 1,000 internet accounts. Tweetbot won't let you browse Twitter without an account. The app requires an account, so I just use the Twitter website. Would be nice if the app worked without an account, though :-) Microsoft Remote Desktop should have been mentioned. It's free and works well. No mention of Microsoft OneNote, which is pretty much completely free, while Evernote definitely isn't? If you have a Microsoft Account, then Microsoft Outlook is the best email client for that service, IMHO. Athletes and Coaches will want to check out Dartfish Express, Coach's Eye, or Hudl Technique (formerly Ubersense). Almost every athlete and coach at the my training facility uses an iPhone because of how good the video analysis apps are on iOS. It's a corner of the market that is often forgotten, but is a huge driver for iOS adoption around the places I frequent (training facilities, competitions, etc.). Flashcard Hero is nice, and available on both macOS and iOS (iCloud Synchronization). WolframAlpha is cheap, and I believe you can open the full results from Siri direction in the app with a Tap. Pixelmator is probably the best Photo Editor on iOS, though I think Affinity is coming out with a version of their app for iPad in the [near?] future. That will likely rival Pixelmator, which is already "not worth buying" on macOS due to the existence of Affinity Photo. For the gamers out there, there is an Xbox app for iOS, as well as PlayStation , PlayStation Messages, and PlayStation Communities. The Roku App can be useful, as well as its equivalents for other Streaming Box platforms (ChromeCast, Apple TV/iTunes Remote, Amazon Fire TV Remote). Tapatalk, for the forum trolls... Skype... Sorry, but as much as I'd like to replace this, it seems as impossible as replacing iMessage in your circle of iPhone friends at this point. Kindle and Audible... Nothing is worse than having your eBooks and Audiobooks locked to a single vendor's platforms... (the Audiobooks may be available on Windows, though the eBooks are not, and you certainly aren't going to be loading them onto an Android or Windows Mobile device). If a service offers a mobile authenticator (i.e. Battle.net Authenticator from Blizzard), use it. Some of us have learned the heard way just so that we can tell you it's worth it ;-) Firefox Focus - Free Content Blocker.

Hybrid Wars: Yandex’s Hidden Threat (Infographic) By vasgri | on 05/31/2017 In a hybrid war, any lull is temporary. In a hybrid war, the instigators never announce their aggression and attack suddenly, from unexpected points, in the first place trying to crush the enemy’s morale – this is why it is called hybrid. Defeated in the first battle and retreating on most of the fronts, Russia is still hoping to conquer Ukraine. And this objective still looks doable – while Ukraine has made headway in terms of energy (gas, coal, nuclear fuel) and technological independence, in the field of informational and political security setbacks come one after the other. The squabble between the Kremlin towers ending in the effective decommissioning of the Humpty-Dumpty project revealed to the public and policymakers the fact long known to the professionals – all the Russian IT majors are closely connected with the Federal Security Service. Yet again the issue of VKontakte, Odnoklassniki, Mail.ru Holding and a number of other Russian services extensively used by Ukrainians came into the spotlight. The standing of Mail.ru has been clear for a long time. The beneficial owner of Mail.ru Group is Alisher Usmanov, Putin’s loyal friend and treasurer , whom he personally awarded with the For Beneficence decoration. The role of Mail.ru in Ukraine has been the topic of discussion for quite some time, and sooner or later it was bound to end in a ban. However, there is another agent of Russian influence in Ukraine right next to this infamous holding which is no less dangerous and sometimes even more so. It is hardly ever mentioned, and this is exactly why it is more dangerous. We are talking about a kraken with enormous resources which are obscure to us and fully controlled by the Russian government. Its tentacles reach all areas of one’s Internet activity, from e-mailing to payments, entertainment and logistics, simultaneously promoting Russian values and pushing individual Ukrainians and mass media outlets into Russia’s bear hug. The name of this kraken is Yandex. In this small investigation we are going to prove the following three claims: Yandex is fully controlled by the Kremlin. Yandex Group is engaged in a very expensive and economically unreasonable expansion in Ukraine. Yandex expansion in Ukraine is the biggest threat to the national security, even compared to the presence of the Russian social networks. We apologize for a large number of links to Russian sources. 1.Yandex is Putin’s business Let’s start with the easy part. It does not take a conspiracy theorist to see Yandex’s full dependency on the Kremlin. Public sources contain enough eloquent information. Russian Yandex is a limited liability company fully owned by the joint-stock company Yandex N.V. (the Netherlands). The Dutch company has two types of shares – A and B. The B-type shares give 10 times more votes and are the tool of effective control over the company. This system intended to protect the company from hostile takeover attempts was developed by Yandex founders, Arkady Volozh and Ilya Segalovich, when Yandex saw the Russian government with its charming night robber’s manners as its biggest threat. A lot has changed since then. Today, Yandex is an amazingly wealthy company with the Russian government as its principal owner and the holder of the golden share. In 2009, Yandex sold one golden share to the state-owned Sberbank of Russia for 1 euro. This share gives broad control over the company’s shareholdings. Since August, 2009, any shareholder who acquired more than 25% of the company’s authorized share capital or votes must request Sberbank’s approval for holding such stake. Thus, an uncooperative shareholder daring to challenge the official policies will not be able even to exit by selling the shares to somebody else, but will be forced to bend the knee or end up like Voronenkov (Ed.: an ex-MP from Russia who defected to Ukraine and was assassinated in Kyiv).   The main important component of the Yandex infrastructure is the Yandex.Money service. Again, 75% of this payment service is owned by the same Sberbank of Russia. It does not operate in Ukraine, however. But not because Yandex does not want to – it has been blocked by the National Bank of Ukraine. If together with these two influence tools, we put into the picture the FSB which is omnipotent in Russia, we will get a corporation fully controlled by the Kremlin in key matters. Actions speak louder than words – the tougher the going gets in Russia, the closer Yandex is leaning towards the Kremlin. This March, the whole Russia witnessed rallies against Medvedev and the government in general convened by the opposition leader Alexey Navalny. The security services managed to hush the event in the printed media. But, the Internet burst with amateur coverage. Yandex responded to the events with a blackout. The news about the rallies never made it to the search results while the latest addresses by Putin and his associates, as well as reports about rich crops and good weather, received extensive coverage. Yandex found itself the target of serious criticism by Russian opposition, and the company’s response sounded rather lame. However, everything is quite clear as it is. Especially in view of the fact that in January, 2017, Yandex’s financial arm started blocking opposition members’ e-wallets at its own discretion. And here Navalny’s role in the Kremlin’s scenario is of little relevance. In any case, Yandex has now the only role – to announce “Dinner is served”. 2.Yandex spares no expenses to infiltrate Ukraine The system with which Yandex can beat the more technologically advanced Google and squeeze it out if the country rests not even on three pillars but on only two – political protection (in China, where Google is suppressed, they develop Baidoo, in Russia, the Kremlin’s anti-Western efforts carved a large niche for Yandex) and, most importantly, a great number of “auxiliary services” (Mail, Navigator, Maps, Money, Jobs, News, Browser) pushing the user into a walled garden of Yandex infrastructure. After getting firm hold of the user, Yandex makes its major profit from its Money, Market and Direct services. Yandex managers, in the spirit of typical Russians chutzpah, recently declared that they were ready to steal Google’s market share in any country. Cool, but not really true. The thing is that Yandex cannot enter any country. It is a very expensive endeavor to surround a foreign citizen with a network of services. However, penetrating Ukraine is coming slightly cheaper for Yandex – there are enough Russian-speaking people and, traditionally, despite Google’s domination, the share of Yandex as a search engine had been higher than one-third before the war. Has something changed after the war began? Nothing. Yandex has not suffered any repressions and is feeling just fine. Moreover, since 2016, it has been very active in capturing the Ukrainian market. It started last summer when Yandex surreptitiously sneaked into Facebook and started expanding its Overton window by pushing its numerous advantages and boasting development plans for Ukraine. It turned out that Ukrainians could tolerate it somehow, while some of them even liked it. After it had expanded its window enough, Yandex used it to push through a new taxi service posting its logos in the Ukrainian cities. It created interesting partnership offers for mass media. Yandex.Direct intensified customer search. Outdoor advertising appeared. Total Yandex expenses on its expansion into Ukraine are estimated in dozens of millions US dollars. In its taxi service only, Yandex now pays the drivers UAH 20 or more as compensation for each journey (this subsidy alone exceeds the profit) and spares no money for marketing. Yandex expenditure budget for such campaigns must be over a hundred million hryvnyas. Where does this money come from? Imagine that Yandex owners were businessmen seeking a business case and trying to manage risks carefully. There is Russia’s aggression against Ukraine. Ukraine responds accordingly – with sanctions and office raids. Any minute, the business in Ukraine can be shut down by the local authorities. Any minute, Putin can start a hot war. In Russia, the law enforcement agencies can start persecuting the company for doing business in an enemy state. The investments in Ukraine are under extremely high risk in any of these scenarios. Success is EXTREMELY UNLIKELY. But what do the Yandex managers do? They invest millions in developing their business in Ukraine. In Russia, there can be only one situation when a business is so careless about the money. It’s when the money comes from the government. Why is Yandex interested in Ukraine? Yandex is very good at pretending to be a “politically independent organization”. It is as good in this as are many “members of the Russian opposition” when they pretend to be “supporters of Ukraine”. Now Yandex managers claim that it is “an independent transnational company”. However, their rhetoric used to be totally different. Yandex founder Ilya Segalovich made an absolutely clear statement: “Yandex is a Russian company. And offering services in the Ukrainian language is a war ruse”. We have already quoted a Yandex developer saying: “We are ready to capture any country, however, it is not necessary right now”. But why then are Ukrainians so special? Why is it necessary to capture this market? Here is the explanation. Yandex has all sorts of possibilities to softly influence Ukraine. Search results manipulation. For millions of Yandex readers, it shows five news at the top. Just five. They determine the country agenda, they represent the most important things. What are now the most important things for Ukrainians according to Yandex? Let’s see: Kyiv News      April 26, Wednesday, 00:18 Russian city flooded with juice following a factory disaster Responsibility claimed for the terrorist attack in St. Petersburg Security Service of Ukraine initiated a criminal case against foreign politicians Scandal in Kyiv about the “Holocaust-Cabaret” sign Putin wants to start military cooperation with Ukraine OK, this must be some mistake. Putin’s false advances, juice flood in Russia, Holocaust scandals in Kyiv, the terrorist attack in St. Petersburg – can these really be the most important news for Ukrainians? Maybe, the problem is that we were searching in the Russian language? Let’s switch to Ukrainian. Kyiv News      April 26, Wednesday, 00:20 Security Service of Ukraine initiated a criminal case against foreign politicians Streets are flooded with tons of juice following a factory disaster in Russia Now we know who is behind the explosions in the Russian subway Putin announced willingness to resume military-technical cooperation with Ukraine: It is essential to create the proper conditions In Kyiv, the sign “Holocaust Cabaret” located opposite the synagogue was taken down So it is intentional. The news Yandex is feeding to Ukrainians is a set deliberately and professionally filtered through the Russian propaganda machine. Since its audience is about one-third of the country (see the infographic), the reach is wider than of any TV channel. At the same time, Russian TV channels are being banned in Ukraine while Yandex is not. Another interesting thing which Yandex can do for the Russian government is its invaluable help in espionage. Today, many Ukrainians believe that Yandex has great Maps and Navigator services. In addition, it has an equally great Mail service, all linked together with monitoring of search queries and matching them to the user’s account. This is how it happens that an elderly lady, Oksana Ivanenko, recently wrote to her brother telling him how her son was serving in the Ukrainian Army (“such a folly”) and where he was assigned and what he was doing there and who his companions were. Also we can see a government official, Fedir Petrenko, looking up Ulysse Nardin watches, making multiple searches related to military equipment and often visiting Ukroboronprom (Ukrainian state-owned defense conglomerate). We can see a lot of different things if we are Yandex in Ukraine. And we pass them on. This is far better than VKontakte or Odnoklassniki with their scraps of photos, geolocations mixed together with some gibberish text. This thing is very much like the Dark Lord’s all-seeing eye. And the feeble ban for the use of non-Ukrainian mail servers (only to government officials! and only for job-related correspondence!) issued by the Ukrainian government in 2015, is not going to make a lot of difference. If only because the most interesting things are in private correspondence, geotargeting and search statistics. And finally: Yandex is not only doing all this in Ukraine. It also makes money and engages Ukrainian businessmen and media into its system. Yandex.Direct, an intermediary between the advertising customer and Internet media, is the main source of the company revenue. Besides, the search engine can include news into its results and enter into agreements with media. Yandex has already hooked the media on package cooperation deals, just like Ukr.Net used to do in its own time. Certain most patriotic Ukrainian mass media receive up to 20% views from Yandex! Then they run Ukrainian customers’ advertizing, and the money again goes to Yandex. Ukrainian money. Part of it is spent on arms for the terrorists in Donbas. We are not exaggerating now, as Yandex and its shareholders must pay taxes in Russia. The prospects are rather gloomy. Yandex’s further expansion in Ukraine should be regarded as nothing else but a time bomb. In an opportune moment, it will be able to either stir the crowds (“Away with the Junta! The people want to be friends with Russia!”) or dampen down the protest wave (“Calm down, if the government makes pro-Russian actions, it’s all right”). And in-between, it will be creating the informational background advantageous for Putin, spy and make more money. It is not so easy to stop this process. Ukraine has no own regulator with sweeping powers like Roscomnadzor (Russian Federal Service for Supervision in the Sphere of Telecom, Information Technologies and Mass Communications), so it cannot block applications, Internet search engines, browser use etc. The only thing which can thwart Yandex’s plans is putting it on the sanction list. If Yandex is unable to trade in Ukraine and engage Ukrainian companies and citizens (run advertising, advertise itself, hire people…), if its office is frequently visited by the law enforcement agencies of all sorts, if it is ridiculed by the civil society, all this will make the expansion too expensive, even for Putin.

The search giant claims that about 50-70% of all emails is spam but that it is able to block 99.9% of all spam mails. This means the email service rejects hundreds of millions emails every day. Gmail logo Google has developed a new method to protect users against spam mails with malicious attachments. In a blog the company explains that it now, “correlate[s] spam signals with attachment and sender heuristics, to predict messages containing new and unseen malware variants.” Messages that are potentially dangerous are also additionally analyzed which could cause a delay of about 4 minutes. During those minutes Google’s Safe Browsing technology will scan the mails. About 0.05% of all emails would require the extra analyzing, according to Google. “These protections enable Gmail to better protect our users from zero-day threats, ransomware and polymorphic malware,” according to Sri Somanchi, Product Manager of Gmail. “In addition, we block use of file types that carry a high potential for security risks including executable and javascript files,” he added. The technology is rolled out right now and it can up to 3 days before all Gmail users make use of it.   Related Forum: Related Tags: gmail security google Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

In Ohio's case, we seem to have the most trouble spelling "beautiful." America's most misspelled words data was gathered by Google by mining the top searched "How to spell ___" analytics from each state in 2017. In most cases, like Ohio, folks searched most often for help spelling words with between six and 10 letters. But two states, West Virginia and Connecticut, sought out help with a 20-letter problem. Before you go thinking those states are extra smart, that word was the Mary Poppins' favorite: "Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious." It turns out the citizens of New York, California, Kentucky and Minnesota also don't know how to spell "beautiful." What that says about all of us is unclear. But at least we're not Rhode Island, who apparently doesn't know how to spell the word "liar." And "college"? Come on, South Dakota. Learn more about America's terrible spelling habits right here.

Leonardo Da Vinci, known to simulate birds wings as he envisioned human flight, was an early adopter of this practise. Flash forward to 2017. Humans are still simulating experiences, only this time anyone can jump in and try them out. With the developments in Virtual Reality, headset competition, AI and cloud based computing, dropping into a world-sized simulation becomes very possible. Google daydream with worldsense Among a host of other announcements, Google mentioned their WorldSense tech at Google IO last week. Standalone Daydream headsets will include WorldSense, a new technology based on Tango. Worldsense enables the headset to track your precise movements in space, without any extra sensors. This means a lot less hassle to jump straight into your very own escapist paradise. Improbable SpatialOS Taking the industry by storm, Improbable have been grabbing the headlines recently. Famed as a high valued startup, Improbable created SpatialOS, a cloud computing platform. This platform allows game engines to be stitched together seamlessly to create massive world environments. It will allow a lot of smaller software companies to rise without the need of serious computing power for test-beds:  The SpatialOS Games Innovation Program in partnership with Google Cloud, is now live and looking to support up to 100 eligible studios via reduced costs and co-marketing opportunities. The Matrix Possibility Although the jury is out on whether this cult sci-fi classic will be rebooted, the theory behind it is creeping towards reality.  Previously the Head of Sony VR division, David Ranyard is now CEO of Dream Reality Interactive and also has a PhD in AI. The core team at DRI previously worked at Sony’s London Studio where they developed the best-seller ‘PlayStation VR Worlds’, featuring the critically acclaimed ‘The London Heist’ and ‘The Deep’. Based in King’s Cross, London. Dream Reality Interactive aim to create compelling VR experiences that focus on natural interaction, believable worlds and AI. Mr Ranyard believes there will be a merging of VR and AI very soon. The main reason for this belief is that VR would be the perfect medium to meet an AI face to face. Go back a decade and VR was only a plaything for the rich. Nowadays you can grab a VR headset and have change from £600. As technology improves, prices will drop and so too will the size of the unit itself. Ranyard guesses that eventually we will just be wearing something similar to shades.   Facebook Twitter Google+ Print E-mail Tags: AI, Daydream, google, improbable, matrix, ranyard, simulation, Tango, VR, worldsense Post a comment Cancel reply Your comment * Your email address will not be shared or made public.

Blog :  Loosely Defining the Software-Defined Data Center Article :  IT Business Edge 2016 Editorial Calendar Google Moves to Make Public Cloud Platform More Flexible Mike Vizard |   IT Unmasked   |   Posted 01 Jun, 2017          |         |     Share As part of an ongoing effort to allow IT organizations to consume only the exact amount of public cloud computing resources they need, Google this week announced it has removed the memory caps attached to any virtual machine. In addition, Google claims it has become the first public cloud provider to make the latest generation of Intel Xeon processors, codenamed Skylake, generally available via the Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Paul Nash, group product manager for GCP, says Google is taking pains to enable IT organizations to consume the virtual machines without requiring them to commit to specific sizes on even an hourly amount of time that ultimately winds up forcing them to pay for unused resources. A Skylake instance of an Intel processor can now be configured with up to 455GB of RAM. Rather than setting specific memory limits, Nash says IT organizations can now determine how much memory they want to allocate to a virtual CPU instance. That approach is intended to be especially appealing to IT organizations aiming to deploy, for example, in-memory computing databases on a public cloud. “We’re starting to see more deployments of applications such as SAP HANA databases or analytics applications by enterprise customers,” says Nash. At the same time, via a new Minimum CPU Platform feature, Google is now allowing IT organizations to select a specific CPU platform for VMs in any given zone. GCP will always schedule a virtual machine to run on that class of CPU family or better. It’s clear that Google is now spending a lot more time and energy courting enterprise customers. While public clouds have been around for 10 years, most enterprise IT organizations are just now making public clouds a standard deployment option for their applications. That doesn’t mean everything will be moving into a public cloud. But it does mean that before making any substantial commitments, many enterprise IT organizations are likely to be very particular about the terms and conditions offered by a public cloud service provider.

By: Reuters | Brussels | Published: June 2, 2017 12:08 AM   The European Commission’s decision will come after a seven-year investigation into the world’s most popular internet search engine triggered by scores of complaints from both US and European rivals. (Reuters) EU antitrust regulators aim to slap a hefty fine on Alphabet unit Google over its shopping service before the summer break in August, two people familiar with the matter said, setting the stage for two other cases involving the US company. The European Commission’s decision will come after a seven-year investigation into the world’s most popular internet search engine triggered by scores of complaints from both US and European rivals. The EU competition authority accused Google in April 2015 of distorting internet search results to favour its shopping service, harming both rivals and consumers. The Commission and Google declined to comment. The US company has in the past rejected the charges, saying that regulators ignored competition from online retailers Amazon and eBay Inc. Fines for companies found guilty of breaching EU antitrust rules can reach 10 percent of their global turnover, which in Google’s case could be about $9 billion of its 2016 turnover. Apart from the fine, the Commission will tell Google to stop its alleged anti-competitive practices but it is not clear what measures it will order the company to adopt to ensure that rivals get equal treatment in internet shopping results. The regulator could set out general principles or specific instructions for Google to follow, said an observer. The Commission’s tough line is in sharp contrast with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission which settled its own web search case with the company in 2013 by requiring Google to stop “scraping” reviews and other data from rival websites for its own products. Watch this also: Google made three unsuccessful attempts to settle the case with the previous European Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia in a bid to stave off a possible fine and a finding of wrongdoing. Almunia’s successor Margrethe Vestager, however, has shown no willingness to settle with Google. The company has also been charged with using its Android mobile operating system to squeeze out rivals and with blocking competitors in online search advertising related to its “AdSense for Search” platform. The platform allows Google to act as an intermediary for websites such as online retailers, telecoms operators or newspapers. The Commission has warned of massive fines in both cases. No Comments.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 1 June 2017 by Maciej Heyman Woods Cross, UTAH Reason #1 Why Financially Supporting the Local .Well-Beyond. ‘Marketing Network (#WellBeyond) Product May Be a Bad Investment Idea Woods Cross, UT — (SBWIRE) — 06/01/2017 — Examples of Apps: Some apps exist in all three forms and are available as not only mobile apps but also desktop and web apps. The Adobe Photoshop image editor is a full software program that runs on your computer, but Adobe Photoshop Sketch is a mobile app that lets you draw and paint from a portable device. It’s more of a condensed version of the desktop application. The same is true with the web app called Adobe Photoshop Express Editor. Another example is Microsoft Word. It’s available for computers in its most advanced form but also on the web and via a mobile app. Those two examples are of apps that exist in all three app forms, but that isn’t always the case. For example, you can get to your Gmail messages through the official Gmail.com website and Gmail mobile app but there isn’t a desktop program from Google that lets you access your mail. In this case, Gmail is both a mobile and web app but not a desktop app. Others (usually games) are similar in that there are both mobile and web versions of the same game but maybe not a desktop app. Or, there might be a desktop version of the game but it’s not available as a web or mobile app. Can APPS that go „Well-Beyond” really make apps that spread health? Can APPS that go „Well-Beyond” really make apps that spread happiness? Do you truly believe that APPS can be tools to help you live a better life? If You Do, then Contact Us Today! g3president@comcast.net 801-809-7766 G3 Develops Customs APPS. G3’s latest APP Technology is called: Well-Beyond-Period (i.e. Well-Beyond.) What the APP? The word „app” is an abbreviation for „application.” It’s a piece of software that can run through a web browser or even offline on your computer, phone, tablet or any other electronic device. Apps may or may not have a connection to the internet. App is a modern take on the word software or application. This is why you probably only hear it in reference to a mobile app or a small piece of software that’s running on a website. It’s typically used to describe anything that isn’t a full-fledged software program. Types of Apps: There are three main types of apps: (1) Desktop, (2) Mobile and (3) Web. Desktop apps, like mentioned above, are usually much „fuller” and are comprised of all the features of a program, whereas the mobile or app equivalent is a simpler and easier-to-use version. This makes sense when you consider that most desktop and web apps are built to be used with a mouse and keyboard along with a much larger display, but mobile apps are intended to be accessed with a finger or stylus on a small screen. Web apps might be full of features too but they have to leverage the capabilities of the internet connection and web browser program, so while some are heavy duty and can perform really well like mobile or desktop programs, most web apps are lightweight for a reason. If an app is a mix between a web app and desktop app, they might be called hybrid apps. These are apps that have an offline, desktop interface and direct access to hardware and other connected devices, but also an always-on connection to the internet for quicker updates and access to internet resources. http://www.g3-development.co/ Why An App Is Important Now that we’ve got that figured out, the next question you’re probably asking is „why should I care about apps?”  Two good reasons: (1) Web apps or online apps can be a faster, cheaper, more efficient way of deploying software in your business.  Rather than buying a software license, having to install it on your servers or local computers, keeping up with updates — all of which can be expensive and take time — you can simply go online and sign up for an account.  In a few minutes you are using the software.  And typically you pay a monthly fee, meaning that you don’t have to pay license fee up front.   For more on what you can do with Web applications, read:  How Small Businesses Use Web Apps – and What to Look For. (2) Mobile apps extend the reach and productivity of your business.  Once you equip your mobile device and/or your employees’ mobile devices with apps, then you and they can perform all sorts of business functions while out of the office traveling, on sales calls, making service calls, etc.  A mobile app usually enables you to do something specific, like accessing your bank account in the case of a banking app, or run payroll with a payroll mobile app.  Check out: 10 Ways to Use Mobile Devices to Run Your Business.   So the next time someone bandies about the term „app” you’ll be in the know. More importantly, perhaps you’ll be in a position to say, „Oh sure, we use all sorts of apps to run our business better.” By 2004, search engines had incorporated a wide range of undisclosed factors in their ranking algorithms to reduce the impact of link manipulation. In June 2007, The New York Times’ Saul Hansell stated Google ranks sites using more than 200 different signals. The leading search engines, Google, Bing, and Yahoo, do not disclose the algorithms they use to rank pages. Some SEO practitioners have studied different approaches to search engine optimization, and have shared their personal opinions.  Patents related to search engines can provide information to better understand search engines. In 2005, Google began personalizing search results for each user. Depending on their history of previous searches, Google crafted results for logged in users. In 2008, Bruce Clay said that „ranking is dead” because of personalized search. He opined that it would become meaningless to discuss how a website ranked, because its rank would potentially be different for each user and each search. In December 2009, Google announced it would be using the web search history of all its users in order to populate search results. Google Instant, real-time-search, was introduced in late 2010 in an attempt to make search results more timely and relevant. Historically site administrators have spent months or even years optimizing a website to increase search rankings. With the growth in popularity of social media sites and blogs the leading engines made changes to their algorithms to allow fresh content to rank quickly within the search results. In February 2011, Google announced the Panda update, which penalizes websites containing content duplicated from other websites and sources. Historically websites have copied content from one another and benefited in search engine rankings by engaging in this practice, however Google implemented a new system which punishes sites whose content is not unique.  In April 2012, Google launched the Google Penguin update the goal of which was to penalize websites that used manipulative techniques to improve their rankings on the search engine. The Real Reasons Why To Use Social Media: 1. If ones business can’t be found — they are not engaging with the „True Market.” 2. Social Media (YouTube) is 64% more effective — than traditional advertising. 3. Ones „True Competition” — is guaranteed to be engaged in Social Media. 4. One will find customers — 15 times faster with Social Media. 5. One can reach the „True Market” — by simply engaging the right people. 6. By ignoring this Social Media Market, they are not creating opportunities – while the competition is. 7. Social Media saves massive amounts of time— if one uses it right. Site owners started to recognize the value of having their sites highly ranked and visible in search engine results, creating an opportunity for both white hat and black hat SEO practitioners. According to industry analyst Danny Sullivan, the phrase „search engine optimization” probably came into use in 1997. The first documented use of the term Search Engine Optimization was John Audette and his company Multimedia Marketing Group as documented by a web page from the MMG site from August, 1997. Early versions of search algorithms relied on webmaster-provided information such as the keyword meta tag, or index files in engines like ALIWEB. Meta tags provide a guide to each page’s content. Using meta data to index pages was found to be less than reliable, however, because the webmaster’s choice of keywords in the meta tag could potentially be an inaccurate representation of the site’s actual content. Inaccurate, incomplete, and inconsistent data in meta tags could and did cause pages to rank for irrelevant searches.  Web content providers also manipulated a number of attributes within the HTML source of a page in an attempt to rank well in search engines.

Google’s Spokesman Taiwo Kola-Ogunlade, made the announcement in Lagos on Thursday. Kola-Ogunlade, who is Google’s Communications and Public Affairs Manager for Anglophone West Africa, said the searches were apparently to know more about Biafra. The News Agency of Nigeria reports that some groups observed a sit-at-home protest on May 30, to commemorate the 50th anniversary since the Biafra uprising ended. Kola-Ogunlade said that Nigerians searched for Democracy Day, Biafra News, Biafra Day, Tiger Woods, Ernesto Valverde and Paul Pogba in the search engine. According to him, a group, the Muslim Rights Concern has rejected May 29 as Nigeria’s Democracy Day, describing it as fraudulent, unrealistic and escapist. KolaOgunlade said: “The group asked the Federal Government to declare June 12 as Democracy Day instead. “May 29 was chosen by the last military regime of General Abdul Salaam Abubakar. “Nigerian researched more on the topic on Google search using the terms: when is democracy day in Nigeria.” The spokesman said that Nigerians also searched for: “why do we celebrate democracy day in Nigeria” and “history of democracy day in Nigeria and democracy day 2017”. The searches commenced on May 25 and ended on May 31. Kola-Ogunlade said there was total shutdown in Nigeria’s South East on May 30, following the Indigenous People of Biafra’s sit-at-home order. He said that the order was to mark the 50th anniversary of the declaration of the defunct Republic of Biafra and also to honour heroes and heroines of the liberation struggle. The Google chief said that the sit-at-home order was totally complied with in the five states in the South East. Kola-Ogunlade explained that people searched Google using terms such as ‘Biafra news today’, ‘Biafra latest news’, ‘radio Biafra news’ and ‘radio Biafra’. The spokesman said that Golf superstar, Tiger Woods’ arrest and charge for driving under the influence by the police in Florida on May 29 also trended on Google. He said that the former golf world number one had to deal with a fresh blow as he struggled to resurrect his career. “Nigerians went on Google to search for ‘Tiger Woods net worth’, ‘Tiger Woods arrested’, ‘Tiger Woods news’, ‘DUI’ and ‘Serena Williams’. The Google chief said that Barcelona FC President, Josep Bartomeu, on May 29 officially confirmed the appointment of Ernesto Valverde as the club’s new head coach, replacing Luis Enrique. Kola-Ogunlade said that sports fanatics Googled ‘Ernesto Valverde profile’, ‘Barcelona’, ‘Who is Ernesto Valverde’ and ‘Barcelona new coach’. He also said that Paul Pogba’s visit to Mecca to give thanks for a good season trended on Google. He said: “Paul Pogba visited Islam’s holiest city, Mecca this week to pray and offer his appreciation for a successful season with Manchester United and to mark the beginning of Ramadan. “Nigerians visited Google to search ‘Paul Pogba religion’, ‘Is Paul pogba a Muslim’, ‘Paul Pogba profile’ and ‘Paul Pogba biography’.” Google Trends launched in May, 2006, allows one to see how popular search terms and their demography have been overtime on the search engine.

Today, Google is debuting several new features for Sheets that are bound to become incredibly useful to its users, including those on the iPhone and iPad. Samsung Chromebook Plus The first major update Sheets gets today is the ability to automatically create charts based on your various spreadsheets, taking the work off of your back and throwing it on to Google’s powerful machine learning. Simply using the “explore” option, users can ask Google natural language questions based on their spreadsheet, “bar chart for ice cream sales” for example, and Google will present them with a chart that uses that data. This works a lot like Sheet’s feature that uses natural language questions in place of complex formulas to pull data from complicated spreadsheets. In either case, these features are designed to make using spreadsheets as easy as possible, and it makes a massive difference compared to what you’d need to do in any other spreadsheet program. Both work via the web and should work for both Chrome and Safari users. Further, Sheets is also adding improved sync between Google Docs and Google Slides today. Last year the company introduced sync for charts in these two areas, and today that expands to tables as well. Simply copy and paste your data to the other service, then tap the “update” button whenever you want to refresh that information from the original spreadsheet. Along with that, Sheets is getting some enhancements in areas which customers have been asking for. The first is keyboard shortcuts. Since Sheets runs in a browser, some of the commands used in native applications such as Excel won’t work since they are already active in the browser. Starting today, Sheets users will be able to override that to take advantage of the same commands they’re already used to. Sheets is also getting improvements to printing, including the ability to adjust margins, scale, and alignment options. Editing charts also gets an upgrade with a new sidebar that makes accessing chart tools easier. This feature will even be making its way to Google’s iPhone/iPad Sheets app. Google has also added new functions to Sheets which help users find insights. Try “SORTN,” a function unique to Sheets, which can show you the top three orders or best-performing months in a sales record spreadsheet. Sheets also supports statistical functions like “GAMMADIST,” “F.TEST” and “CHISQ.INV.RT.” All of these features are available starting today for all Google Sheets users.

A Chrome ad blocker would seem to be a self-sustained shot to the foot, but GOOGL stock won't notice a thing By Brian Wu, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  Jun 1, 2017, 9:25 am EDT Get AMZN alerts: Submit     View All   Popular Posts: Is Elon Musk Right About Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock? Is International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) Stock All Out of Air? Will Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Die by Ad Blocker? Recent Posts: Is International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) Stock All Out of Air? Will Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Die by Ad Blocker? Can Bitcoin Become Better at Being Gold Than Gold? View All Posts Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) tacked on roughly 7% in gains for May to clock in just under $990, and is rapidly closing in on the $1,000 psychological mark. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) touched their first, but there’s little doubt that a clean break of the four-digit figure would mean big things for GOOGL stock. Source: Shutterstock Alphabet has its impressive Q1 earnings beat in April 27 to thank for the strong momentum. Not even news that its search division, Google, will soon bring an ad-blocking feature to both the desktop and mobile versions of its popular Chrome browser have dampened the mood at the bull camp. The headline received very little attention at the time, but with GOOGL stock at all-time highs, it’s worth diving into potential threats. Alphabet Is Protecting the Gravy Train The last time anything of those seismic proportions happened in the advertising industry was back in 2015 when Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) made good its threat to allow third-party ad-blocking extensions on iOS 9 and future operating systems. At the time, GOOGL stock tanked nearly 5% in response. The ad blocking feature looks like Google is shooting itself in the foot, at first glance. Though it’s far from clear what shape or form Google’s ad-blocking tool will take. One option though would be to block  all ads from any site that carried even a single offending ad. The company could work with the Coalition for Better Ads to determine which ads don’t meet the cut, meaning most pop-up ads, auto-play videos and some countdown ads including YouTube’s pre-roll ads would likely be cut off. Google says it’s still ironing out the details regarding whether the feature will be enabled by default — if it ever comes to pass. There are two key reasons why GOOGL would want to take such a controversial move: To create a good user experience To preempt the proliferation of third-party ad-blocking tools. This will not be the first time that Google will be going to extreme lengths to protect its advertising gravy train. Anybody remember the AdSense Conspiracy? Maybe you don’t, but the long and short of it is that a couple of years ago Google literally banned thousands of publishers from its lucrative AdSense program in a bid to get rid of publishers who were gaming the system through illegal practices such as click fraud. Google says it found it necessary to weed out the bad actors, including those who were buying lots of low quality traffic (read: clicks that convert poorly and offer little returns to advertisers) in a bid to preserve the integrity of its display network. Is Ad Blocking Really a Threat to GOOGL Stock? Basically, it’s the same script here, but with a different cast. Google is well-aware that too many offending or irrelevent ads create a bad experience for end-users and lead to poor ROI for advertisers — all of which can badly backfire on the company. We saw that in March when giant brands and advertisers including AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T), the British government, PepsiCo, Inc. (NYSE:PEP) and Wal-Mart Stores Inc (NYSE:WMT) pulled their advertising dollars from Google after their ads were featured on YouTube videos posted by extremists. Alphabet ostensibly wants to avoid a repeat of the same, and also to make sure extremists don’t get paid in the future.

MAGAZINE EVENTS PAPERS TOPICS GOVTECH 100 NAVIGATOR SEARCH Applications 7 in 10 Smartphone Apps Share Your Data With Third-Party Services Once an app has permission to collect that information, it can share your data with anyone the app’s developer wants to – letting third-party companies track where you are, how fast you’re moving and what you’re doing. by Narseo Vallina-Rodriguez, University of California, Berkeley and Srikanth Sundaresan, Princeton University / June 1, 2017 Shutterstock Our mobile phones can reveal a lot about ourselves: where we live and work; who our family, friends and acquaintances are; how (and even what) we communicate with them; and our personal habits. With all the information stored on them, it isn’t surprising that mobile device users take steps to protect their privacy, like using PINs or passcodes to unlock their phones. The research that we and our colleagues are doing identifies and explores a significant threat that most people miss: More than 70 percent of smartphone apps are reporting personal data to third-party tracking companies like Google Analytics, the Facebook Graph API or Crashlytics. When people install a new Android or iOS app, it asks the user’s permission before accessing personal information. Generally speaking, this is positive. And some of the information these apps are collecting are necessary for them to work properly: A map app wouldn’t be nearly as useful if it couldn’t use GPS data to get a location. RELATEDIndependent ISPs Take Aim at SF Internet Access OrdinanceFCC Approves Waiver to Allow N.Y. North Country ISP to Operate Under Rural DesignationFederal Court to Rehear Case Exempting ISPs from Privacy Regulations But once an app has permission to collect that information, it can share your data with anyone the app’s developer wants to – letting third-party companies track where you are, how fast you’re moving and what you’re doing. The help, and hazard, of code libraries An app doesn’t just collect data to use on the phone itself. Mapping apps, for example, send your location to a server run by the app’s developer to calculate directions from where you are to a desired destination. The app can send data elsewhere, too. As with websites, many mobile apps are written by combining various functions, precoded by other developers and companies, in what are called third-party libraries. These libraries help developers track user engagement, connect with social media and earn money by displaying ads and other features, without having to write them from scratch. However, in addition to their valuable help, most libraries also collect sensitive data and send it to their online servers – or to another company altogether. Successful library authors may be able to develop detailed digital profiles of users. For example, a person might give one app permission to know their location, and another app access to their contacts. These are initially separate permissions, one to each app. But if both apps used the same third-party library and shared different pieces of information, the library’s developer could link the pieces together. Users would never know, because apps aren’t required to tell users what software libraries they use. And only very few apps make public their policies on user privacy; if they do, it’s usually in long legal documents a regular person won’t read, much less understand. Developing Lumen Our research seeks to reveal how much data are potentially being collected without users’ knowledge, and to give users more control over their data. To get a picture of what data are being collected and transmitted from people’s smartphones, we developed a free Android app of our own, called the Lumen Privacy Monitor. It analyzes the traffic apps send out, to report which applications and online services actively harvest personal data. Because Lumen is about transparency, a phone user can see the information installed apps collect in real time and with whom they share these data. We try to show the details of apps’ hidden behavior in an easy-to-understand way. It’s about research, too, so we ask users if they’ll allow us to collect some data about what Lumen observes their apps are doing – but that doesn’t include any personal or privacy-sensitive data. This unique access to data allows us to study how mobile apps collect users’ personal data and with whom they share data at an unprecedented scale. In particular, Lumen keeps track of which apps are running on users’ devices, whether they are sending privacy-sensitive data out of the phone, what internet sites they send data to, the network protocol they use and what types of personal information each app sends to each site. Lumen analyzes apps traffic locally on the device, and anonymizes these data before sending them to us for study: If Google Maps registers a user’s GPS location and sends that specific address to maps.google.com, Lumen tells us, “Google Maps got a GPS location and sent it to maps.google.com” – not where that person actually is. Trackers are everywhere Lumen’s user interface, showing the data leakages and their privacy risks, found for a mobile Android game called ‘Odd Socks.’ ICSI, CC BY-ND More than 1,600 people who have used Lumen since October 2015 allowed us to analyze more than 5,000 apps. We discovered 598 internet sites likely to be tracking users for advertising purposes, including social media services like Facebook, large internet companies like Google and Yahoo, and online marketing companies under the umbrella of internet service providers like Verizon Wireless. We found that more than 70 percent of the apps we studied connected to at least one tracker, and 15 percent of them connected to five or more trackers. One in every four trackers harvested at least one unique device identifier, such as the phone number or its device-specific unique 15-digit IMEI number. Unique identifiers are crucial for online tracking services because they can connect different types of personal data provided by different apps to a single person or device. Most users, even privacy-savvy ones, are unaware of those hidden practices. More than just a mobile problem Tracking users on their mobile devices is just part of a larger problem. More than half of the app-trackers we identified also track users through websites. Thanks to this technique, called “cross-device” tracking, these services can build a much more complete profile of your online persona. And individual tracking sites are not necessarily independent of others. Some of them are owned by the same corporate entity – and others could be swallowed up in future mergers. For example, Alphabet, Google’s parent company, owns several of the tracking domains that we studied, including Google Analytics, DoubleClick or AdMob, and through them collects data from more than 48 percent of the apps we studied. Data transfers observed between locations of Lumen users (left) and third-party server locations (right). Traffic frequently crosses international boundaries. ICSI, CC BY-ND   Users’ online identities are not protected by their home country’s laws. We found data being shipped across national borders, often ending up in countries with questionable privacy laws. More than 60 percent of connections to tracking sites are made to servers in the U.S., U.K., France, Singapore, China and South Korea – six countries that have deployed mass surveillance technologies. Government agencies in those places could potentially have access to these data, even if the users are in countries with stronger privacy laws such as Germany, Switzerland or Spain. Connecting a device’s MAC address to a physical address (belonging to ICSI) using Wigle. ICSI, CC BY-ND   Even more disturbingly, we have observed trackers in apps targeted to children. By testing 111 kids’ apps in our lab, we observed that 11 of them leaked a unique identifier, the MAC address, of the Wi-Fi router it was connected to. This is a problem, because it is easy to search online for physical locations associated with particular MAC addresses. Collecting private information about children, including their location, accounts and other unique identifiers, potentially violates the Federal Trade Commission’s rules protecting children’s privacy. Just a small look Although our data include many of the most popular Android apps, it is a small sample of users and apps, and therefore likely a small set of all possible trackers. Our findings may be merely scratching the surface of what is likely to be a much larger problem that spans across regulatory jurisdictions, devices and platforms. It’s hard to know what users might do about this. Blocking sensitive information from leaving the phone may impair app performance or user experience: An app may refuse to function if it cannot load ads. Actually, blocking ads hurts app developers by denying them a source of revenue to support their work on apps, which are usually free to users. If people were more willing to pay developers for apps, that may help, though it’s not a complete solution. We found that while paid apps tend to contact fewer tracking sites, they still do track users and connect with third-party tracking services. Transparency, education and strong regulatory frameworks are the key. Users need to know what information about them is being collected, by whom, and what it’s being used for. Only then can we as a society decide what privacy protections are appropriate, and put them in place. Our findings, and those of many other researchers, can help turn the tables and track the trackers themselves.

Gboard v6.3 enables search suggestions in the Google app and widget for some Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/06/01 9:32am PDTJun 1, 2017 36 Plus 1 on G+ 60 Share on Facebook 41 Share on Twitter Total Shares137 Applications News Google dropped a new version of Gboard last night, which includes a number of cool improvements to search. Some people are reporting another interesting feature in the form of Google search suggestions int he Google app and widget. Not everyone seems to have this, though. On older versions of Gboard, the keyboard's suggestion bar disappears when doing a search. That's still what it looks like for myself and most other AP staff after the update to v6.3. However, we've heard from a not insignificant number of people who are seeing the suggestion bar. This appears when searching via the Google widget and within the Google app. It seems to work just like the suggestion bar elsewhere. Start typing, and the keyboard guesses what word you might want to use next based on your typing history and the power of Google's prediction engine. Just grab the new version of Gboard and open a search to see if you've got it. Download QR-Code Gboard - the Google Keyboard Developer: Google Inc.

I think they accidentally pushed out the dogfood version. mike shwilly Somehow the suggestions/corrections bar doesn't even appear for me on menus like that. Anyone got a clue? https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/fcf5ae1af260f403d6fe67b4a16960601a0f678f624415845c966be49de6c152.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/7db6affa5d2544f41d448de7188c46494be0ca138cb1088830fd557174531b65.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/0729dbe9f8f2b6951428091c0dc20c66822aa0bd1fb3d8c8198fba4181bd896a.png Artem Russakovskii That's the mystery - I'm not seeing suggestions either, but many are. mike shwilly I think i had this problem since Nexus 5. It has always been really annoying. Suicide_Note Deftones are a terrible band. Hurricane Andrew I still do not see it on my S7 Edge. I wonder if launcher choice makes a difference. I use Action Launcher. Would be interesting to know what launcher people who are and are not seeing this are using. Yuri Vidal on my s7 it works. are you a beta tester? i also dont use touchwiz launcher. the suggestion bar works for me on chrome, and on google app too. jkl888 I see the suggestions on my phone Artem Russakovskii I'm on the Pixel Launcher, tried both Google app 7.2 and 7.3, and Gboard 6.2 and 6.3, and I don't have this. Reply and post your launcher, Google App version, and Gboard version, and whether you have suggestions or not. Armando Rodriguez Have you notice that the "short" height is shorter than previous versions? abqnm Are you on an S8 or G6? They tweaked some proportions on the odd aspect ratio devices. The S8 doesn't have the hugely tall spacebar anymore, which may be why it seems that way. If you're not on one of those I'm not sure as it seems the same to me. Armando Rodriguez Nexus 5 DPI at 420 Raz Have it. Nova Beta, GBoard 6.3.15.157483061-arm64-v8a, Google app 7.3.19.21.arm64. The new GBoard just asked for access to my SMS to improve the suggestions. Bruno Logerfo wait since when there's a dark theme for the google widget? João Ricardo He problaby has a theme kervation I am using a Google Pixel XL with the stock pixel launcher, running Google app version 7.3.19.21 & Google Gboard version 6.3.15.157483061. I have the suggestion bar for the Google app and also the Chrome beta browser and regular Chrome browser. I also have search suggestions show up when typing in the Google app. JATIN BANSAL I think this is also new. Earlier in dark themes, they used to have a white glow around emoji but now it is gone. I like it now https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/c8bcc901c9f60b97c05dc467df6fa4838f96cabcfbf6421714f5ec7189958205.png roberto.elena I wished the keyboard had a dynamic theme that would change automatically based on the app being used, like the status bar does: Youtube = red, WhatsApp = green, Facebook = blue, etc. thegrau There's a third party keyboard that does exactly that. Can't remember the name, but I believe it's based on AOSP Yuri Vidal chroma keyboard Łukasz Ordon There is also Xposed module that can do that...

Lexster Okay, but...when will they put a freaking space after punctuation? It's not that difficult, but after using Swiftkey, I really can't get used to having to put a space after punctuation. catalysto I would NOT want that. Don't need my OCD flaring up with unnecessary spaces. Though, sure, it should probably be an option. Lexster How are spaces after periods of sentences unnecessary? hype67 In acronyms, when the dot doesn't denote the end of a sentence. As decimals. Others situations I can't remember off the top of my head. Lexster USe acronyms with periods a lot, do you? I can't remember the last time I did. It's not generally required for acronyms. You put FBI, not F. B. I. But, yes, it's a little annoying with decimals, but that can generally be programmed to recognize if the space isn't needed. Swiftkey often does. It misses sometimes, sure, but usually works well. If a field needs an IP address, it usually knows this and doesn't put a space. And yes, it can be annoying with website names, but it's much easier to backspace every once in awhile than have to hit space after every single period or question mark. Łukasz Ordon Just press space twice :P It puts full stop AND a space after it... Lexster Yes, but I prefer having the space after punctuation. Doesn't require two taps of the space bar. And it only enters periods. Łukasz Ordon Oh well... You can't make everyone happy... Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Typing URLs and email addresses is a giant pain in SwiftKey. catalysto When it's the last sentence. Lexster Okay? Well, it doesn't add a space until you type a letter, so if it's the last sentence, there wouldn't be a space unless you typed something else. catalysto A period does not always signify the end of a sentence though. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman So glad it doesn't do that. One of the worst things in SwiftKey. Typing URLs and email addresses was such a giant pain in the ass. Hitting space after I type a period isn't a big deal to me AT ALL. Especially since I'm used to typing on a keyboard anyway, so do it automatically. ozzyager I do see suggestions when doing a search. I also recieved the dog bone version first, before being updated again shortly thereafter. Maybe just a coincidence? catalysto Same thing happened to me. It's still working after updating to the non-beta version, too. Though I'm in the beta program for Gboard, so maybe that has something to do with it? My version number is 6.3.15.157483061-arm64-v8a, in case anyone is curious. Łukasz Ordon That Gboard app version with dog paw should not be released publicly. It indicates 'dogfood' version (as googlers call it) which should be tested only inside Google. Dogfood is just debug version of normal app (don't quote me on that tho) ozzyager Correct. This is why I wondered if there was any connection between that version being released by accident to some, like myself, and only some seeing the suggestions when doing a search. Of course it might just be a server side update that is being tested, etc. Łukasz Ordon I've myself got dogfood version but shortly after (like 5 mins later) I've received another update with normal apk... Armv7 version btw :p roberto.elena It also gives suggestions in Chrome while in incognito mode. abqnm While that may be unwanted, it should be pointed out that it now gives suggestions in the Chrome address bar. Period. Previously it did not suggest anything at all in the Chrome address bar, incognito or no. I still don't have it in search though. It does work when typing to Assistant, but it may have done that previously. boop Can someone explain the nav bar in the second pic? Łukasz Ordon It's probably Pixel phone navbar... destinyhud pixel phone if u mean the down arrow then when u click a bar the left become a down arrow boop The color, I mean Hurricane Andrew Running Action Launcher 3, Google app version 7.3.19.21, Gboard version 6.3.15.157483061 and do not have the suggestions in the search app. Łukasz Ordon Talking about Google app itself... apparently, cards in Google Now feed have new design now https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/5fbd4b5888c4ad6d684f6ab3ba7589a3354607b05f565c0b7aed404237d8d8dc.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/ed878edc7fa830f93bf49db1a7d5c8b4267ae6cada762eb9d0e723312cd72c5a.png Łukasz Ordon Aaaaand it's gone...

Teja The word prediction is the only thing I worry about. Swiftkey is way better than Gboard which made me to switch back to Swiftkey. Michael Oghia Does anyone else experience problems with the spell check feature? Sometimes I misspell a word, it tells me it's misspelled, but then doesn't offer any suggestions. It used to work better a few years ago (when it was still just keyboard or whatever it was called). Vratislav Jindra I would swear I had this yesterday. Today it disappeared.

The European Commission's decision will come after a seven-year investigation into the world's most popular internet search engine triggered by scores of complaints from both U.S. and European rivals. The EU competition authority accused Google in April 2015 of distorting internet search results to favour its shopping service, harming both rivals and consumers. The Commission and Google declined to comment. The U.S. company has in the past rejected the charges, saying that regulators ignored competition from online retailers Amazon and eBay Inc. Fines for companies found guilty of breaching EU antitrust rules can reach 10 percent of their global turnover, which in Google's case could be about $9 billion of its 2016 turnover. Apart from the fine, the Commission will tell Google to stop its alleged anti-competitive practices but it is not clear what measures it will order the company to adopt to ensure that rivals get equal treatment in internet shopping results. The regulator could set out general principles or specific instructions for Google to follow, said an observer. The Commission's tough line is in sharp contrast with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission which settled its own web search case with the company in 2013 by requiring Google to stop "scraping" reviews and other data from rival websites for its own products. Google made three unsuccessful attempts to settle the case with the previous European Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia in a bid to stave off a possible fine and a finding of wrongdoing. Almunia's successor Margrethe Vestager, however, has shown no willingness to settle with Google. The company has also been charged with using its Android mobile operating system to squeeze out rivals and with blocking competitors in online search advertising related to its "AdSense for Search" platform. The platform allows Google to act as an intermediary for websites such as online retailers, telecoms operators or newspapers. The Commission has warned of massive fines in both cases.

Name: Subject: Message: Gmail takes on spam and phishing messages with new security features Newsby Mitja Rutnik11 hours ago 94 11 Google has added a bunch of new security features to Gmail including early phishing detection that uses machine learning, click-time warnings for malicious links, unintended external reply warnings, and built-in defenses against new threats. According to Google, machine learning already helps Gmail block spam as well as phishing emails with an accuracy of over 99.9 percent. The online search giant wants to further improve the spam protection accuracy with early phishing detection, which basically delays certain messages (less than 0.05 percent on average) and performs what Google describes as a rigorous phishing analysis. It works together with the Google Safe Browsing tech that looks for and flags URLs that are considered phishy. See also: Gmail SMTP settings and Gmail setup – a quick guide 3 days ago Google has also added unintended external reply warnings to Gmail. Whenever you send an email to someone outside of your company domain, a warning will pop up asking you if you really want to send it. Thankfully, if you’re sending the email to an existing contact or someone who you’re communicating with on a regular basis, the warning won’t be displayed. That’s an important factor, as it could get quite annoying if the warning would appear every single time you wanted to send an email, right? Google also claims that the new built-in defenses against ransomware and polymorphic malware now help Gmail block a lot more emails that have the potential to harm users in some way. Threats are classified by combining a bunch of spam, malware, and ransomware signals with attachment heuristics (emails that could be threats based on signals) and sender signatures (already marked malware).

Image Credit: Screenshot It’s now easier to create charts from data stored in Google Sheets, thanks to a new feature added Thursday. Users can open up the Explore tab and type in the sort of chart they want, and the software will produce it for them. For example, typing “bar chart of revenue and profit” is supposed to generate exactly that. The feature uses machine learning to parse a user’s text input and translate that into a chart. It’s designed to make it faster for people to create visuals based on their data, without requiring them to wade through a set of menus using trial and error in order to get the right result. Above: An animated GIF shows Google’s new chart generation feature. That builds on Google’s existing investments in using machine intelligence to simplify the creation and analysis of data in its spreadsheet software. The company launched the Explore tab in Sheets in 2015, which automatically generated charts for users based on the content of a spreadsheet. Google is locked in a battle with Microsoft over which tech titan will provide productivity software to modern workers, and these intelligent capabilities can help the company compete. In addition, Sheets gained some capabilities that are aimed directly at addressing the needs of legacy Excel users. Users can now set their own custom keyboard shortcuts for particular functions, so that they can use the same keybindings they’re used to from Excel. Google also updated Sheets’ printing functionality, so that users have more control over how a spreadsheet looks on paper. Sheets’ chart editing capabilities got an upgrade, too. Users can select custom colors for their diagrams, add multiple trendlines, and create 3D charts. Users who have iPhones and iPads can also edit charts on their mobile devices, something that wasn’t previously possible. Google’s spreadsheet software also now supports syncing data in tables between Sheets, Docs, and Slides. Users can copy data from a spreadsheet and paste it into a document or presentation, then click the update button to get the latest version of the information. That feature builds on support for live-updating charts that Google added last year.

The European Commission's decision will come after a seven-year investigation into the world's most popular internet search engine triggered by scores of complaints from both U.S. and European rivals. The EU competition authority accused Google in April 2015 of distorting internet search results to favour its shopping service, harming both rivals and consumers. The Commission and Google declined to comment. The U.S. company has in the past rejected the charges, saying that regulators ignored competition from online retailers Amazon and eBay Inc. Fines for companies found guilty of breaching EU antitrust rules can reach 10 percent of their global turnover, which in Google's case could be about $9 billion of its 2016 turnover. Apart from the fine, the Commission will tell Google to stop its alleged anti-competitive practices but it is not clear what measures it will order the company to adopt to ensure that rivals get equal treatment in internet shopping results. The regulator could set out general principles or specific instructions for Google to follow, said an observer. The Commission's tough line is in sharp contrast with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission which settled its own web search case with the company in 2013 by requiring Google to stop "scraping" reviews and other data from rival websites for its own products. Google made three unsuccessful attempts to settle the case with the previous European Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia in a bid to stave off a possible fine and a finding of wrongdoing. Almunia's successor Margrethe Vestager, however, has shown no willingness to settle with Google. The company has also been charged with using its Android mobile operating system to squeeze out rivals and with blocking competitors in online search advertising related to its "AdSense for Search" platform. The platform allows Google to act as an intermediary for websites such as online retailers, telecoms operators or newspapers. The Commission has warned of massive fines in both cases.

The Wednesday move by Google’s Waze unit, best known for its navigation and traffic monitoring app, extends the year-old carpooling service outside its initial markets of northern California and Israel. Waze will now be pairing up drivers and passengers across a wider expanse that includes heavily congested highways in Los Angeles and other parts of southern California. Waze connects drivers and riders with similar commutes based on their home and work addresses. Riders request carpool rides in advance, but aren’t guaranteed matches. Drivers can only pick up one rider; they also get to review the profiles of potential riders in advance and to select the ones they prefer. Riders can only request two rides a day. The service is primarily focused on rush-hour commutes, when the odds of successfully matching drivers and riders are highest. Waze said tens of thousands of drivers and passengers have registered for carpooling in northern California. It won’t begin booking carpooling requests outside northern California until June 6 to give interested drivers and riders a chance to sign up for the program. Since signing up for Waze’s carpooling service in February, Lesley Watson says she gets paid $3.50 to $5.50 every time she gives someone a ride on her morning commute from her home in Oakland to her job at an advertising agency in San Francisco. Sometimes, she also picks up a passenger on her evening commute home, although she usually drives solo on her return trip. “It has helped me offset my commute costs for gas, tolls and parking,” Watson, 28, says. It also has given her a chance to make new friends among the five or six people she regularly picks up through the Waze app. Although the expansion could pose a threat to Uber and Lyft, most people who use ride-hailing services don’t rely on them to get to work, according to survey data. Instead, most people use Uber and Lyft for recreational or social reasons, particularly between 10 p.m. and 4 a.m. when public transit shuts down in many places. That’s according to a survey of 4,500 people conducted last year by the Shared-Use Mobility Center, a group that focuses on public transit and ways to reduce the number of cars on the road. Only 21 percent of the respondents summoned a raid-hailing service to commute to work, and then did so sporadically, the study found. Cost could easily be a factor. For instance, commuting to downtown San Francisco from the suburb of Lafayette via Uber could cost between $30 and $40 each way using the service’s own carpool option, according to Uber’s fare estimator . On Waze, that 22-mile ride would cost no more than $12.42. Unlike ridesharing services, Waze’s carpooling service isn’t designed to provide drivers with a major source of income. It tries to calculate a price that’s most likely to encourage two people to carpool instead of driving separately. At most, drivers are paid 54 cents per mile, the rate that Internal Revenue Service allows to account for gasoline, insurance and maintenance for a vehicle used on business. “We want the ride to be affordable enough for riders so they use it frequently and we want drivers to be rewarded for taking a detour to fill an extra seat,” said Josh Fried, head of business development for the carpooling service. The service also doesn’t make much money for Google, which derives most of its income from digital advertising. But the company will be amassing data on commuters and their travel habits. That could be useful to Google for a variety of purposes, including targeted advertising and planning potential future transport services, including any involving the self-driving cars one of its spinoffs, Waymo, is currently testing. While carpooling has been around for decades, it’s never been particularly popular. “People don’t want to get tied to something that requires them to ride with the same people and be in a certain place at a certain time,” said Sharon Feigon, executive director for the Shared-Use Mobility Center. Using technology to match drivers and passengers on days they want to participate in a carpool offers more flexibility that may get more people to try it out, and discover they like it, Feigon said. But it’s not an easy business. Lyft ended its carpool service nine months ago, citing a shortage of drivers willing to meet the demand. It’s currently experimenting with another commute-hour option called Shuttle that makes designated stops on routes in two test markets, San Francisco and Chicago. The expansion makes it more likely that Waze will offer carpooling in other urban regions, although Fried declined to comment on that possibility. So far, the only other market that Waze has confirmed is Brazil, where the carpooling service will begin operating later this year. Copyright 2017 Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The Nest Cam IQ, unveiled Wednesday, will be Nest’s first device to draw upon the same human-like skills that Google has been programming into its computers – for instance, to identify people in images via its widely used photo app. Facebook deploys similar technology to automatically recognize and recommend tags of people in photos posted on its social network. THE COST OF FACIAL RECOGNITION The new camera will set you back almost $300, and you’ll also have to pay $10 a month for a plan that includes facial recognition technology. The same plan will also include other features, such as alerts generated by particular sounds – barking dogs, say – that occur out of the camera’s visual range. The camera will only identify people you select through Nest’s app for iPhones and Android devices. For instance, you could program the device to recognize a child, friend or neighbor, after which it will send you a notifications about that person being in the home. It won’t try to recognize anyone that an owner hasn’t tagged. Even if a Nest Cam IQ video spies a burglar in a home, law enforcement officials will have to identify the suspect through their own investigation and analysis, according to Nest. PRIVACY CONCERNS Facial recognition is becoming much more common on home-security cameras. Netatmo, for instance, introduced a security camera touting a similar facial recognition system in 2015. That camera sells for $100 less than the Nest Cam IQ. The way that the Nest and Netatmo cameras are being used doesn’t raise serious privacy concerns because they are only verifying familiar faces, not those of complete strangers, said Jennifer Lynch, who specializes in biometrics as a senior staff attorney for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital advocacy group. But Lynch believes privacy issues are bound to crop up as the resolution and zoom capabilities of home security cameras improve, and as engineers develop more sophisticated ways of identifying people even when an image is moving or only a part of a face is visible. Storing home-security videos in remote data centers also raises security concerns about the imagery being stolen by computer hackers. “It definitely could become a slippery slope,” Lynch said. The privacy issues already are thorny enough that Nest decided against offering the facial recognition technology in Illinois, where state law forbids the collection and retention of an individual’s biometric information without prior notification and written permission from a person. FURTHER DETAILS Nest’s $10 monthly subscription plans includes video storage for 10 days. Video can be stored for a maximum of 30 days with an upgrade to a subscription plan costing $30 per month. The high-end camera supplements lower-resolution indoor and outdoor cameras that Nest will continue to sell for almost $200. Neither of the lower-end cameras is equipped for facial recognition. Nest can tap into Google’s expertise in artificial intelligence because both companies are owned by the same parent company, Alphabet Inc. Copyright 2017 Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Email Password Remember me Forgot password?     Log in with Facebook Log in with Twitter Log In news tech & science social media business entertainment life sports     Google announces new Gmail features to make email safer Listen | Print By James Walker     13 hours ago in Technology Google has detailed its latest progress in its ongoing work to make email more secure. The company claimed its automated systems can now detect and filter out 99.9 percent of phishing emails. The statement comes after a recent high-profile Gmail scam. In May, thousands of Gmail users were duped into falling for a phishing scam when attackers distributed an extremely widespread email purporting to be from Google Docs. The message made it through Google's spam filters and into inboxes worldwide, causing outcry on social media. Although Google responded rapidly to the situation, it wasn't enough to combat the days of negative publicity that followed. In the weeks since the campaign, Google has released a series of blog posts explaining how it is working to make Gmail safer and prevent similar emails from being spread again. In its latest post, it revealed that it now blocks phishing emails with "over 99.9 percent accuracy." It identifies scams using a network of machine learning models that constantly assess emails flowing through its network. The company's new early phishing detection model is now being introduced to take its systems a step further. The new neutral network performs selective analysis on a tiny subset of Gmail messages. In total, an average of less than 0.05 percent of all messages will be selected by the system. They'll be slightly delayed from reaching their recipient so they can be processed by advanced phishing analysis tools. READ MORE: Chinese 'Fireball' malware could cause 'global catastrophe' This preventative approach should help to stop future phishing campaigns before they have a chance to get established. Google is fighting an uphill battle though: the company said that between 50 and 70 percent of the Gmail messages received each day are spam. With this volume of messages to isolate and destroy, staying on top of the situation isn't an easy matter. "Security threats are constantly evolving and we’re always looking for ways to help people protect their data," Google said. "With new built-in defenses against ransomware and polymorphic malware, Gmail now blocks millions of additional emails that can harm users. We classify new threats by combining thousands of spam, malware and ransomware signals with attachment heuristics (emails that could be threats based on signals) and sender signatures (already marked malware)." Google also announced a new mechanism it's launching for Gmail customers who use the web app as part of their work. The company is debuting a system that's designed to alert you to potential sensitivity issues if you're addressing an email to somebody outside of your organisation. When you draft an email that's to an address on a different domain, Gmail will show a reminder not to send private information. It's designed to prevent you inadvertently sharing business files with external contacts you could have mistakenly selected. Even if you are intentionally messaging someone in a different firm, the prompt could remind you to think twice about what you're including in the email.

subscribe Vogue fashionbeautycultureliving runway videoshop Most Shared Culture > Books Catherine Lacey's Dating Dystopia The Answers Is This Summer's Must-Read Novel June 1, 2017 5:34 PM by Megan O'Grady Catherine Lacey's second novel, The Answers, will be released on June 6, 2017.Photo: Antoine Doyen/ Courtesy of Leemage “I’ll probably spend the rest of my life wanting these verifiable answers that just aren’t there,” says Catherine Lacey, midway through a Negroni at a Chicago bar. Recently named one of Granta’s Best Young American Novelists, the 32-year-old author, who has large, clear eyes and tattoos of paper clips on the insides of her arms, is talking about her second novel, The Answers (Farrar, Straus and Giroux), a darkly funny, tartly feminist look at the tender state of our bodies and souls in the Information Age. Though more ambitious than her sleeper-hit debut, Nobody Is Ever Missing, Lacey’s sophomore effort is, like its predecessor, grounded in the perspective of a young woman who is searching and a little strange; lacking a certain social coding, she seems almost dangerously porous. Mary, who suffers from an undiagnosed but debilitating illness, responds to a Craigslist ad for an “income generating experience” to pay for her expensive New Age energy therapy (“neuro-physio-chi bodywork”). Soon she’s embroiled in a bizarre experiment led by a famous actor she’s never heard of, Kurt Sky, who is on a quest to perfect the mechanisms of romantic love. Her job, as Kurt’s Emotional Girlfriend (there’s also an Anger Girlfriend and an Erotic Girlfriend, among others), is to listen, ask questions, and touch the actor’s hand at appropriate intervals. After five weeks, they will exchange keys; after two to four months, they will say “I love you” after “an emotionally intimate moment.” Mary turns out to be unusually well-suited for the role but also especially vulnerable to it, and if her backstory is a little makeshift—an off-the-grid childhood with a religious zealot for a father—she’s an ideal mouthpiece for the author’s sharp observations of an era in which there’s much to believe in but little to depend on. The novel, Lacey explains over drinks, came to be when two short stories unexpectedly merged, and was inspired in part by an encounter with an eerily perceptive therapist the author met while undergoing bodywork for scoliosis. “You can Google anything, but you can’t Google your body,” she says. “We’re so used now to being able to get accurate information very, very quickly, but you can’t get it about this meat thing that you’re dragging around,” she says, looking at me penetratingly. “You don’t know if you have cancer right now.” Lacey, whose work manages to be both conceptual and human, socially aware and mordant—think DeLillo for millennials—captures the absurdity of a culture that persists in thinking that enlightenment is a matter of the right purchase, hashtag, or Google search. Many of the novel’s memorable scenes could be described as surreal if they weren’t so real. Near the climax of the novel, Mary stops in a store, thirsty, and the following exchange ensues: "I’d like a water. Totally, what kind? Of water? We have coconut water, aloe water, ginger water, vegetable water, herb-infused water, yellow watermelon juice-enhanced water, turmeric water, and deionized apple-cider-vinegar agave water. A heavy dread overtook her." All of our waters, Lacey suggests, have only made us thirstier for things that can’t be bottled. “It’s like you’re five cleanses away from your insides being made of crystal,” says Lacey, with a laugh, “and I’ve been through all the therapy and I have a great relationship with everyone in my family now and I know where all my problems came from and I’m blissed out on a hilltop, tweeting about it.” As Kurt and Mary grow more attached, his experiment does little to illuminate the delicate matters of the heart, and instead, of course, complicates them hopelessly. “Love is a compromise for only getting to be one person,” Mary muses aloud to Kurt early in their relationship—a line that sounds more romantic than it turns out to be, especially after Kurt repurposes it later in the novel. (Lacey says she thought of the line while on MDMA.) For Mary and Kurt, love is less of an opportunity for mutual empathy and a relief from solitude than a challenge to identity. In an era of dating algorithms, to what extent can we trust our emotions, much less another person’s? “I don’t know if anyone can really fall in love under that level of scrutiny,” says the author, and it’s true that Kurt’s experiment is somewhat reminiscent of the television reality dating show The Bachelor in its efforts to atomize romance, only to kill off any humanity in it. “Could it ever be authentic? Anyway, I feel like at the beginning of any relationship, you’re observing yourself having it, there’s a degree of remove, and that’s why you have to stay with somebody long enough in order for that to kind of wear off. So then you’re not observing yourself being so thrilled, you’re just left with what actually is the feeling, not looking at it.” Lacey, who recently moved to Chicago to be with her partner (the author and fellow Best Young Novelist Jesse Ball), grew up in Tupelo, Mississippi, in a Methodist family—her father owns a hardware store that’s been in the family for almost a century—and she has a former Southerner’s distrust of the status quo. “I don’t know that I have much in common with the person I was when I was 14,” she says. “Even the person who wrote Nobody Is Ever Missing, I can’t really speak on her behalf anymore. The text is kind of what’s left of that person, and that person doesn’t exist anymore. It both makes me very uncomfortable and very relaxed, because who you are and what you think that you’re attached to vanishes very quickly.” After studying art at Loyola University New Orleans, she turned to writing, interested in essayistic journalism along the lines of Nick Flynn and Eula Biss. She was working on her MFA in nonfiction at Columbia University when she took a seminar on first person narrative fiction taught by Heidi Julavits. “I was trying to write about Mississippi for a long time, and about religion and religiosity, and I really should have been writing fiction,” says Lacey. “I was just spinning my wheels for years, trying to write something that just needed to be in a different form.” If love is one compromise for being only one person, literature is another. (A recent trip to Japan has Lacey reading Tanizaki’s The Makioka Sisters and Ishiguro’s A Pale View of Hills.) After a book tour for The Answers, there awaits a temporary return to her home state, where she’ll serve as the University of Mississippi’s John Grisham Writer in Residence through 2018. A short story collection is due out next year, and she’s finishing a “short, strange novel that began as a joke and ended up pretty serious.” At a time when any discussion of art inevitably bends to politics, it’s encouraging to find a novelist like Lacey asking questions that more subtly unnerve. “I don’t have to write a political book or a social novel in order to subtly change the way people perceive their immediate environment,” she says. “It’s much more about getting people to continue to think, period.” Recommended For You Vogue Fashion Beauty Culture Living Runway Magazine City Guides Videos Subscribe Vogue App Vogue Shop Promotions Vogue Archive Masthead Vogue Podcast Facebook Twitter Pinterest Google+ Instagram Sign up for Newsletter Contact Press Subscriptions Digital Editions Vogue Worldwide UK India Italy Mexico Australia Germany Korea Spain Taiwan Russia France Brazil Japan Portugal Ukraine Turkey China Reprints/Permissions Media Kits Careers Condé Nast Digital Allure Ars Technica Backchannel Bon Appétit Brides Condé Nast Traveler Epicurious Glamour Golf Digest Golf World GQ GQ Style Pitchfork Self Style Teen Vogue The New Yorker The Scene Vanity Fair Vogue W Wired Magazine Customer Service Sitemap © 2017 Condé Nast.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 1:00 AM, June 2, 2017 Updated: 5:35 AM, June 2, 2017 BRUSSELS - EU antitrust regulators aim to slap a hefty fine on Alphabet <GOOGL.O> unit Google over its shopping service before the summer break in August, two people familiar with the matter said, setting the stage for two other cases involving the U.S. company. The European Commission's decision will come after a seven-year investigation into the world's most popular internet search engine triggered by scores of complaints from both U.S. and European rivals. The EU competition authority accused Google in April 2015 of distorting internet search results to favour its shopping service, harming both rivals and consumers. The Commission and Google declined to comment. The U.S. company has in the past rejected the charges, saying that regulators ignored competition from online retailers Amazon <AMZN.O> and eBay Inc <EBAY.O>. Fines for companies found guilty of breaching EU antitrust rules can reach 10 percent of their global turnover, which in Google's case could be about $9 billion of its 2016 turnover. Apart from the fine, the Commission will tell Google to stop its alleged anti-competitive practices but it is not clear what measures it will order the company to adopt to ensure that rivals get equal treatment in internet shopping results. The regulator could set out general principles or specific instructions for Google to follow, said an observer. The Commission's tough line is in sharp contrast with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission which settled its own web search case with the company in 2013 by requiring Google to stop "scraping" reviews and other data from rival websites for its own products. Google made three unsuccessful attempts to settle the case with the previous European Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia in a bid to stave off a possible fine and a finding of wrongdoing. Almunia's successor Margrethe Vestager, however, has shown no willingness to settle with Google. The company has also been charged with using its Android mobile operating system to squeeze out rivals and with blocking competitors in online search advertising related to its "AdSense for Search" platform. The platform allows Google to act as an intermediary for websites such as online retailers, telecoms operators or newspapers. The Commission has warned of massive fines in both cases.

Hide Caption 6 of 6 Story highlights Landscaped rooftop garden among plans for the 11-story, 1 million-square-foot building Construction will start next year if Google's plans are approved (CNN)Google has released designs for a new 11-story, 1 million-square-foot headquarters in London near King's Cross railway station, complete with a sprawling, landscaped rooftop garden. The facilities will include a cafe, gym and pool as well as a rooftop track and ground-floor retail spaces, according to the company's application for permission to build. The campus has been designed by an all-star team that includes Thomas Heatherwick, the British designer behind London's 2012 Olympic cauldron, and Danish architect Bjarke Ingels' BIG firm. The two are also collaborating on Google's Mountain View campus in California. Diplomatic design: New US embassies make an architectural statement The current designs seem characteristic of the two men. Heatherwick was the mastermind behind the recently scrapped garden bridge in London, and last year, Ingels opened what he calls a "courtscraper" -- a structure that combines a communal courtyard with the density of a skyscraper -- in New York.

The Jaguars may be trying to tell us something. by Adam Stites Jun 1, 2017, 1:22pm EDT tweet share pin Rec For a while now, Google news search results have labeled the Jacksonville Jaguars' official site as "satire." The team is a decade removed from its last winning season, so it feels accurate to call the franchise a joke. But what’s worse is that the mistake is probably the fault of Jaguars.com and not Google. How did it happen? The best guess is that someone at Jaguars.com accidentally applied the satire tag when setting up the site in the Google News Publisher Center. That has meant that for about a year, all links to Jaguars.com have been listed as comedy: Presumably, this will get fixed eventually. But I like to imagine that the Jaguars are secretly telling us that the team has been satirical performance art all along. Blake Bortles threw interceptions that bounced off his receivers’ feet in consecutive weeks during the 2016 season. Earlier in the season, he also made the comical mistake of running well past the line of scrimmage before throwing a pass. Then he made the SAME EXACT MISTAKE. All of this would make much more sense if Bortles was secretly playing the role of slapstick quarterback to provide us with football bloopers. We’re on to you, Jaguars.

The classic “ten blue links” have been shoved further down the page to make way for Google’s own services, such as Maps, Hotel Finder, Flight Search, etc, etc. Depending on your point of view, this is simply free market capitalism in action or grossly unfair because Google still has the temerity from advertisers at the same time. Over the years, many travel brands have slowly weaned themselves off the need for ultra-engineered SEO tactics to get traffic – but many haven’t. A new report from SimilarWeb, examining web traffic trends for airlines, accommodation, intermediaries and cruise lines in the US, shows just how much some brands are still reliant on SEO to funnel in their much-needed traffic. For example, according to the report, TripAdvisor between April 2016 and March this year got around 70% of its traffic from organic search (i.e. Google). No other mainstream brand in the US comes close to this figure, perhaps with the exception of car rental giant Enterprise which relies on about 45% on traffic coming from that direction, or the Royal Caribbean cruise giant with nearly 35%. Amongst the leading accommodation brands, Airbnb comes in at 25%, whilst Expedia and Kayak – OTA and metasearch engine leaders respectively – also both have around 25%. So what about that other element of the Google ecosystem, paid-search? Airlines are not relying too much on PPC (although Delta has altered it strategy over the last year), but both Booking.com and Expedia see around 10% of traffic coming via paid-search. Car rental brands such as Enterprise and Hertz have similar datapoints.   Previous Article Next Article   About the Writer :: Kevin May Kevin is senior editor and a co-founder at Tnooz.

Microsoft thinks blockchain tech could solve one of the internet’s toughest problems: digital identities Written by Joon Ian Wong Obsession Future of Finance June 01, 2017 Easier on a blockchain. (Reuters/Beawiharta) Share Written by Joon Ian Wong Obsession Future of Finance June 01, 2017 When swathes of the internet were taken offline for hours last year, it was because Internet of Things devices had been hijacked by a malicious botnet, known as “Mirai,” that overwhelmed parts of the global network with streams of data. The Mirai attacks were made possible by easily discovered passwords hard-coded into the cheap devices, which were mainly internet connected cameras. The cameras in turn were able to direct floods of traffic at targets because it’s easy to fake internet addresses. The vulnerabilities go to a core problem with the way the internet is designed: There isn’t a foolproof way to identify people or machines online. “The Mirai botnet is a direct result of the fact that we didn’t think about identity originally,” says Dan Elitzer, who leads work on blockchain technology and digital identity at the research and development unit of design consultancy Ideo. “Now it’s time to say we had some fundamentally flawed assumptions at the time.” Elitzer isn’t alone in his thinking. His firm is part of a group, including Microsoft, Accenture, and several startups, that launched the Decentralized Identity Foundation at the Consensus blockchain tech conference in New York May 30, with the goal of developing a system to reliably identify things on the internet. They think they’ll succeed because they’ll use blockchain technology, that same system catching the imagination of banks, corporations, and libertarians. Blockstack, one of the foundation’s startup members, has released a set of programming tools and a handful of pre-made apps that would create a decentralized internet. Greater decentralization of the internet would place more control in the hands of the user—or more specifically, the user’s devices, instead of relying on clouds operated by the likes of Google or Amazon. “Every character you type is literally going to Google,” says Muneeb Ali, Blockstack’s co-founder. “But your device is almost like a supercomputer. We just need to upgrade the internet infrastructure to be more user-friendly.” Among the apps Blockstack released at the conference is one for decentralized storage called Gaia that lets users keep files on existing, centralized services like Dropbox or Google Drive, while splitting up the contents and keeping them encrypted from the service operators. This turns the cloud services into “dumb drives,” Blockstack explained in a blog post. Blockstack faces an uphill climb. In order for its vision to succeed, the company must first convince developers to build things on top of the infrastructure it has designed. Those developers must then create compelling applications, which attract hoards of users. And that’s not taking into account competition from the internet giants they’re trying to disrupt. Even the inventor of the web, Tim Berners-Lee, is working to solve the same problem with his Solid project, which he hopes will “re-decentralize” the web—but with little evidence that his efforts are paying off. Microsoft’s involvement in the Decentralized Identity Foundation gives hope that the project’s quixotic goal may one day be realized. Microsoft is on the back foot when it comes to internet identities today, crowded out by widespread use of Gmail accounts or Facebook logins among consumers. “With Microsoft, it’s the Android play,” says Elitzer, referring to the Android operating system’s open-source nature, which allowed Google to rapidly grab market share in the smartphone sector. Big banks and corporates who think a blockchain might be a panacea for the problem of digital identity have some support. In the Netherlands, the ministry of economic affairs has started the Dutch Blockchain Coalition, getting government agencies and corporations to work on digital identities using the technology. Djuri Baars, a blockchain specialist at the big Dutch bank Rabobank, imagines a system that allows users to control what pieces of private information they wish to share with banks, the tax agency, or even a supermarket when buying a bottle of wine. “Because everyone can use the blockchain, everyone can connect their own systems to the blockchain,” he says. “You can give explicit consent to share information with specific recipients.” The open-source Hyperledger Project, a consortium of 142 corporate members from Airbus to Samsung, is also working to decentralize identity. “It’s critical to everything,” says Hyperledger executive director Brian Behlendorf. “You have to have identity to do business. But how do you implement it in such a way that privacy is built in?” The consortium is developing something called Project Indy to address this problem. “We can correlate an identity on one chain to an identity on another. It allows individuals to be a point of authentication on how their data gets shared,” Behlendorf says. The problem of digital identity on the internet has attracted a motley crew of computer scientists, big banks, and industrial conglomerates, bound by a shared belief that the ideas behind bitcoin could solve one of the online world’s trickiest problems. For many in the space, there is also a sense that blockchain tech could be the internet’s missing link. “We got many things wrong in the early days of the web,” says Behlendorf, who developed the open-source Apache server, which powers most of the web today. “This is a chance to get it right.” Read this next: Bitcoin set a new price record as the industry gathers for its biggest event of the year Most Popular Stop being positive and just cultivate neutrality for existential cool Read full story home our picks popular latest obsessions search

By Natalie Gagliordi for Between the Lines | June 1, 2017 -- 17:00 GMT (10:00 PDT) | Topic: Cloud Google's spreadsheet editor app Sheets is getting another machine learning boost to make sorting through rows and rows of spreadsheet data more digestible. what's hot on zdnet ​AMD stakes its claim to the high ground Who's to blame for that cyberattack? Here's why nobody's really sure Microsoft is making the Mac look old and stale WannaCry ransomware code errors could give victims a chance to get files back Central to the update is Explore, Google's system for running natural language searches in Sheets, Docs and Slides. In its initial implementation, Explore let Sheets users ask questions in words, not formulas, to analyze their data. For instance, one could ask, "what is the distribution of products sold?" and Explore will help surface the answers. Now, that same machine learning technology will allow users to create charts from their spreadsheet data using a simple natural language query. "If you don't see the chart you need, just ask," Google Sheets product manager Daniel Gundrum wrote in a blog post. "Instead of manually building charts, ask Explore to do it by typing in 'histogram of 2017 customer ratings' or 'bar chart for ice cream sales.' Less time spent building charts means more time you can act on new insights." Google is also bringing an instant sync feature to Sheets that's been available in Docs and Slides since last year. The feature lets users programmatically update charts in Docs, Slides and now Sheets by copying and pasting data from one source to another and tapping the "update" button to sync the data. Here's a look at a few more updates coming to Sheets today: Keyboard shortcuts: Change default shortcuts in your browser to the existing spreadsheet shortcuts currently in use. Upgraded printing interface: Preview Sheet data, adjust margins, select scale and alignment options or repeat frozen rows and columns before printing. New chart editing tools: Create and edit charts in a new sidebar. Choose from custom colors in charts or add additional trendlines to model data. More spreadsheet functions: New batch of functions brings the total function count in Sheets to more than 400.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars SECURITY After 0 successful submissions, Google quadruples top reward for hacking Android to $200,000 Emil Protalinski@EPro June 1, 2017 10:16 AM Google has paid security researchers millions of dollars since launching its bug bounty program in 2010. The company today expanded its Android Security Rewards program because “no researcher has claimed the top reward for an exploit chain in two years.” Right. Well, the program has only been around for two years — a Google spokesperson confirmed that nobody has ever claimed the top reward. The Android team is making two bug bounty increases today. The reward for a remote exploit chain or exploit leading to TrustZone or Verified Boot compromise has quadrupled from $50,000 to $200,000. The reward for a remote kernel exploit has quintupled from $30,000 to $150,000. Want to make six figures? Just figure out how to hack Android. Since the Android Security Rewards program launched, Google has rewarded security researchers over $1.5 million. The company today also shared that in the second year of the program, it received over 450 qualifying vulnerability reports from researchers. In the past year, the average pay per researcher jumped by 52.3 percent and the payout doubled to $1.1 million. 115 individuals were paid an average of $2,150 per reward and $10,209 per researcher. You can expect the payouts to continue increasing, especially if someone manages to claim either of the two new rewards. Google is clearly hoping to incentivize security researchers to dedicating more time trying to hack its mobile operating system. Last month, Google shared that there are over 2 billion monthly active Android devices. The company needs all the help it can get to protect these users. Bug bounty programs are an excellent addition to existing internal security programs. They help motivate individuals and groups of hackers not only to find flaws, but to disclose them properly when they do, instead of using them maliciously or selling them to parties that will. But this is just one piece of the puzzle. Google today also shared a small update on its recent security strategy to collaborate closer with Android manufacturers: Over 100 device models have a majority of their deployed devices running a security update from the past 90 days. Finding bugs and squashing them in Android is one thing, but the company is also making more of an effort to actually have those fixes trickle down to actual devices via monthly security updates.

People can already use Explore in Sheets to ask questions and receive data in return, like “which person has the top score?” Now, you can ask Google to make a chart or graph. So, for example, you could type “histogram of 2017 customer ratings” or “bar chart for ice cream sales” and receive that visual image in return. You can then instantly insert it into your sheet. Today’s update will also let you sync data to tables from your Sheets to Google Docs or Slides. You can copy and paste your Sheets data to Docs or Slides and tap “update” to keep it synced. A new charts sidebar is launching, too, that allows for the creation of 3D charts. It’s available on iPhones and iPads, as well. The print interface is also being refreshed so you can adjust margins, select scale and alignment options, or repeat frozen rows and columns before sending to the printer. Spreadsheet updates aren’t always the most exciting, but honestly, less time spent making charts is a positive for everyone.

To match Exclusive EU-GOOGLE/ANTITRUST REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson/File Photo 1/2 left right A man holds his smartphone which displays the Google home page, in this picture illustration taken in Bordeaux, Southwestern France, August 22, 2016. REUTERS/Regis Duvignau 2/2 By Foo Yun Chee | BRUSSELS BRUSSELS EU antitrust regulators aim to slap a hefty fine on Alphabet (GOOGL.O) unit Google over its shopping service before the summer break in August, two people familiar with the matter said, setting the stage for two other cases involving the U.S. company. The European Commission's decision will come after a seven-year investigation into the world's most popular internet search engine triggered by scores of complaints from both U.S. and European rivals. The EU competition authority accused Google in April 2015 of distorting internet search results to favour its shopping service, harming both rivals and consumers. The Commission and Google declined to comment. The U.S. company has in the past rejected the charges, saying that regulators ignored competition from online retailers Amazon (AMZN.O) and eBay Inc (EBAY.O). Fines for companies found guilty of breaching EU antitrust rules can reach 10 percent of their global turnover, which in Google's case could be about $9 billion of its 2016 turnover. Apart from the fine, the Commission will tell Google to stop its alleged anti-competitive practices but it is not clear what measures it will order the company to adopt to ensure that rivals get equal treatment in internet shopping results. The regulator could set out general principles or specific instructions for Google to follow, said an observer. The Commission's tough line is in sharp contrast with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission which settled its own web search case with the company in 2013 by requiring Google to stop "scraping" reviews and other data from rival websites for its own products. Google made three unsuccessful attempts to settle the case with the previous European Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia in a bid to stave off a possible fine and a finding of wrongdoing. Almunia's successor Margrethe Vestager, however, has shown no willingness to settle with Google. The company has also been charged with using its Android mobile operating system to squeeze out rivals and with blocking competitors in online search advertising related to its "AdSense for Search" platform. The platform allows Google to act as an intermediary for websites such as online retailers, telecoms operators or newspapers. The Commission has warned of massive fines in both cases.

Gboard v6.3 enables search suggestions in the Google app and widget for some Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/06/01 9:32am PDTJun 1, 2017 36 Plus 1 on G+ 60 Share on Facebook 41 Share on Twitter Total Shares137 Applications News Google dropped a new version of Gboard last night, which includes a number of cool improvements to search. Some people are reporting another interesting feature in the form of Google search suggestions int he Google app and widget. Not everyone seems to have this, though. On older versions of Gboard, the keyboard's suggestion bar disappears when doing a search. That's still what it looks like for myself and most other AP staff after the update to v6.3. However, we've heard from a not insignificant number of people who are seeing the suggestion bar. This appears when searching via the Google widget and within the Google app. It seems to work just like the suggestion bar elsewhere. Start typing, and the keyboard guesses what word you might want to use next based on your typing history and the power of Google's prediction engine. Just grab the new version of Gboard and open a search to see if you've got it. Download QR-Code Gboard - the Google Keyboard Developer: Google Inc.

Artem Russakovskii Yes https://plus.google.com/+ArtemRussakovskii/posts/aYxevnQNXK7 https://plus.google.com/+ArtemRussakovskii/posts/BsXuhKZQbmz F4LL0U7 I got that too, briefly. I think they accidentally pushed out the dogfood version. mike shwilly Somehow the suggestions/corrections bar doesn't even appear for me on menus like that. Anyone got a clue? https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/fcf5ae1af260f403d6fe67b4a16960601a0f678f624415845c966be49de6c152.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/7db6affa5d2544f41d448de7188c46494be0ca138cb1088830fd557174531b65.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/0729dbe9f8f2b6951428091c0dc20c66822aa0bd1fb3d8c8198fba4181bd896a.png Artem Russakovskii That's the mystery - I'm not seeing suggestions either, but many are. mike shwilly I think i had this problem since Nexus 5. It has always been really annoying. Suicide_Note Deftones are a terrible band. Hurricane Andrew I still do not see it on my S7 Edge. I wonder if launcher choice makes a difference. I use Action Launcher. Would be interesting to know what launcher people who are and are not seeing this are using. Yuri Vidal on my s7 it works. are you a beta tester? i also dont use touchwiz launcher. the suggestion bar works for me on chrome, and on google app too. jkl888 I see the suggestions on my phone Artem Russakovskii I'm on the Pixel Launcher, tried both Google app 7.2 and 7.3, and Gboard 6.2 and 6.3, and I don't have this. Reply and post your launcher, Google App version, and Gboard version, and whether you have suggestions or not. Armando Rodriguez Have you notice that the "short" height is shorter than previous versions? abqnm Are you on an S8 or G6? They tweaked some proportions on the odd aspect ratio devices. The S8 doesn't have the hugely tall spacebar anymore, which may be why it seems that way. If you're not on one of those I'm not sure as it seems the same to me. Armando Rodriguez Nexus 5 DPI at 420 Raz Have it. Nova Beta, GBoard 6.3.15.157483061-arm64-v8a, Google app 7.3.19.21.arm64. The new GBoard just asked for access to my SMS to improve the suggestions. Bruno Logerfo wait since when there's a dark theme for the google widget? João Ricardo He problaby has a theme kervation I am using a Google Pixel XL with the stock pixel launcher, running Google app version 7.3.19.21 & Google Gboard version 6.3.15.157483061. I have the suggestion bar for the Google app and also the Chrome beta browser and regular Chrome browser. I also have search suggestions show up when typing in the Google app. JATIN BANSAL I think this is also new. Earlier in dark themes, they used to have a white glow around emoji but now it is gone. I like it now https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/c8bcc901c9f60b97c05dc467df6fa4838f96cabcfbf6421714f5ec7189958205.png roberto.elena I wished the keyboard had a dynamic theme that would change automatically based on the app being used, like the status bar does: Youtube = red, WhatsApp = green, Facebook = blue, etc. thegrau There's a third party keyboard that does exactly that. Can't remember the name, but I believe it's based on AOSP Yuri Vidal chroma keyboard Łukasz Ordon There is also Xposed module that can do that...

Lexster Okay, but...when will they put a freaking space after punctuation? It's not that difficult, but after using Swiftkey, I really can't get used to having to put a space after punctuation. catalysto I would NOT want that. Don't need my OCD flaring up with unnecessary spaces. Though, sure, it should probably be an option. Lexster How are spaces after periods of sentences unnecessary? hype67 In acronyms, when the dot doesn't denote the end of a sentence. As decimals. Others situations I can't remember off the top of my head. Lexster USe acronyms with periods a lot, do you? I can't remember the last time I did. It's not generally required for acronyms. You put FBI, not F. B. I. But, yes, it's a little annoying with decimals, but that can generally be programmed to recognize if the space isn't needed. Swiftkey often does. It misses sometimes, sure, but usually works well. If a field needs an IP address, it usually knows this and doesn't put a space. And yes, it can be annoying with website names, but it's much easier to backspace every once in awhile than have to hit space after every single period or question mark. Łukasz Ordon Just press space twice :P It puts full stop AND a space after it... Lexster Yes, but I prefer having the space after punctuation. Doesn't require two taps of the space bar. And it only enters periods. Łukasz Ordon Oh well... You can't make everyone happy... Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Typing URLs and email addresses is a giant pain in SwiftKey. catalysto When it's the last sentence. Lexster Okay? Well, it doesn't add a space until you type a letter, so if it's the last sentence, there wouldn't be a space unless you typed something else. catalysto A period does not always signify the end of a sentence though. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman So glad it doesn't do that. One of the worst things in SwiftKey. Typing URLs and email addresses was such a giant pain in the ass. Hitting space after I type a period isn't a big deal to me AT ALL. Especially since I'm used to typing on a keyboard anyway, so do it automatically. ozzyager I do see suggestions when doing a search. I also recieved the dog bone version first, before being updated again shortly thereafter. Maybe just a coincidence? catalysto Same thing happened to me. It's still working after updating to the non-beta version, too. Though I'm in the beta program for Gboard, so maybe that has something to do with it? My version number is 6.3.15.157483061-arm64-v8a, in case anyone is curious. Łukasz Ordon That Gboard app version with dog paw should not be released publicly. It indicates 'dogfood' version (as googlers call it) which should be tested only inside Google. Dogfood is just debug version of normal app (don't quote me on that tho) ozzyager Correct. This is why I wondered if there was any connection between that version being released by accident to some, like myself, and only some seeing the suggestions when doing a search. Of course it might just be a server side update that is being tested, etc. Łukasz Ordon I've myself got dogfood version but shortly after (like 5 mins later) I've received another update with normal apk... Armv7 version btw :p roberto.elena It also gives suggestions in Chrome while in incognito mode. abqnm While that may be unwanted, it should be pointed out that it now gives suggestions in the Chrome address bar. Period. Previously it did not suggest anything at all in the Chrome address bar, incognito or no. I still don't have it in search though. It does work when typing to Assistant, but it may have done that previously. boop Can someone explain the nav bar in the second pic? Łukasz Ordon It's probably Pixel phone navbar... destinyhud pixel phone if u mean the down arrow then when u click a bar the left become a down arrow boop The color, I mean Hurricane Andrew Running Action Launcher 3, Google app version 7.3.19.21, Gboard version 6.3.15.157483061 and do not have the suggestions in the search app. Łukasz Ordon Talking about Google app itself... apparently, cards in Google Now feed have new design now https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/5fbd4b5888c4ad6d684f6ab3ba7589a3354607b05f565c0b7aed404237d8d8dc.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/ed878edc7fa830f93bf49db1a7d5c8b4267ae6cada762eb9d0e723312cd72c5a.png Łukasz Ordon Aaaaand it's gone... Now cards are normal for me...

Teja The word prediction is the only thing I worry about. Swiftkey is way better than Gboard which made me to switch back to Swiftkey. Michael Oghia Does anyone else experience problems with the spell check feature? Sometimes I misspell a word, it tells me it's misspelled, but then doesn't offer any suggestions. It used to work better a few years ago (when it was still just keyboard or whatever it was called). Vratislav Jindra I would swear I had this yesterday. Today it disappeared.

In fact, Google’s machine learning systems are now nearly on par with humans. Nintendo Switch According to Mary Meeker’s annual Internet Trends Report, Google’s machine learning-backed voice recognition — as of May 2017 — has achieved a 95% word accuracy rate for the English language. That current rate also happens to be the threshold for human accuracy. Quantifying Google’s progress, accuracy has improved nearly 20% since 2013. There are some caveats, including how the word error rate is calculated using real world search data that is more error prone than typical human dialogue. This achievement is quite remarkable and lines up with Pichai noting that “error rates continue to improve even in noisy environments.” Google’s efforts in AI are aiding in these improvements. For example, a deep learning technique known as neural beamforming allowed the company to release Google Home with only two microphones, but achieving the same quality as having eight. It is also responsible for recent features like multi-user support that can recognize up to six different users and provide personalized Assistant results.

Today, Google is debuting several new features for Sheets that are bound to become incredibly useful to its users. The best gifts for Android users The first major update Sheets gets today is the ability to automatically create charts based on your various spreadsheets, taking the work off of your back and throwing it on to Google’s powerful machine learning. Simply using the “explore” option, users can ask Google natural language questions based on their spreadsheet, “bar chart for ice cream sales” for example, and Google will present them with a chart that uses that data. This works a lot like Sheet’s feature that uses natural language questions in place of complex formulas to pull data from complicated spreadsheets. In either case, these features are designed to make using spreadsheets as easy as possible, and it makes a massive difference compared to what you’d need to do in any other spreadsheet program. Further, Sheets is also adding improved sync between Google Docs and Google Slides today. Last year the company introduced sync for charts in these two areas, and today that expands to tables as well. Simply copy and paste your data to the other service, then tap the “update” button whenever you want to refresh that information from the original spreadsheet. Along with that, Sheets is getting some enhancements in areas which customers have been asking for. The first is keyboard shortcuts. Since Sheets runs in a browser, some of the commands used in native applications such as Excel won’t work since they are already active in the browser. Starting today, Sheets users will be able to override that to take advantage of the same commands they’re already used to. Sheets is also getting improvements to printing, including the ability to adjust margins, scale, and alignment options. Editing charts also gets an upgrade with a new sidebar that makes accessing chart tools easier. This feature will even be making its way to Google’s iPhone/iPad Sheets app. Google has also added new functions to Sheets which help users find insights. Try “SORTN,” a function unique to Sheets, which can show you the top three orders or best-performing months in a sales record spreadsheet. Sheets also supports statistical functions like “GAMMADIST,” “F.TEST” and “CHISQ.INV.RT.” All of these features are available starting today for all Google Sheets users.

Resold Pixel phones originally purchased from Project Fi are having their IMEIs blacklisted Richard Gao Follow View All Posts 2017/05/25 5:30am PDTMay 25, 2017 59 Plus 1 on G+ 150 Share on Facebook 58 Share on Twitter Total Shares267 Google News Pixel Pixel XL Project Fi Back in November, when the Pixel was slowly beginning to ship to customers, there were numerous reports of people getting their Google accounts banned for purchasing Pixel and Pixel XL devices with the intent to resell them. It turns out that this issue hasn't exactly been laid to rest, as it seems that Pixel phones purchased from Project Fi for this purpose are now getting blacklisted via their IMEI numbers. As an overview, people originally bought Pixels from both the Google Store and Project Fi to sell them to a New Hampshire-based reseller. Why New Hampshire, you may ask? There's no sales tax. Both parties here were supposed to make a profit, but Google ended up banning a ton of accounts for a violation of their terms of service.. Considering how important Google is in our lives (Gmail, Google Photos, YouTube, Play Store, etc.), a lot of people were obviously not happy. In the end, Google did restore many of these accounts, but it was obviously enough for a good scare. However, it seems that Google still hasn't completely forgiven people for violating their ToS. Kyle Bennett, the editor-in-chief and founder of the HardOCP website, had his Pixel XL's IMEI blacklisted just yesterday. IMEIs are typically blacklisted by carriers when phones are lost or stolen, but that's clearly not what happened here. Calling T-Mobile didn't do anything, as their staff told him that they could not reverse the blacklisting. His communication with Swappa support was more interesting, though; here's what they told him: "Sorry to hear of the complaints. We have seen a great number of Pixel devices becoming blacklisted the past two days. We are still trying to figure out why this has happened to so many devices. We are working to find out the cause of this widespread issue. It would be best for both of you to keep on top of Google and pressing them for an explanation. In one other case, I saw this morning Google agreed to send the buyer a replacement device so that might be an option to look into. Seller please work with the buyer and Google to see if they can get to the bottom of it." Kyle then contacted Google support, with the first representative claiming that he had simply received a spam message. When he showed a second rep how his IMEI had indeed been blacklisted via Swappa's ESN/IMEI checker (useful tool if you're buying a phone, by the way), he was told that his Pixel XL hadn't been reported as stolen, but that it had been originally purchased through Project Fi. Kyle was also once again told that his phone hadn't really been blacklisted, but a quick rescan of his IMEI in Swappa proved otherwise. His case was escalated to Project Fi's support team, but the customer service rep refused to give him a reference number and told him that he'd receive it via email. After contacting a third representative, Kyle was informed that his phone had indeed been blacklisted, but that Google wasn't responsible for doing so. This lends further credence to the Project Fi explanation, as it's the carrier and not the manufacturer that has the ability to blacklist devices. The situation is still ongoing, but that's all we know for now; we'll update with more information as we get it.

Okay. NeverrKnowsBest You can sell a Project Fi phone. You just buy them in bulk and try to make a profit off Project Fi. Stupid that the customer is being punished for this, though. Green Dog Is it clear that this is one of the phones that was bought in bulk from that retailer? From my reading, it was just a resold phone. I mean obviously, it's not happening to all phones, but the fact that it's still happening is a concern. NeverrKnowsBest The IMEIs are being linked to one particular reseller in New Hampshire. celestre Do you have more information than is present in the article on this? NeverrKnowsBest I'm just going off what the article said. I would love to read more, but I highly doubt they are just flipping the switch on every resold Project Fi phone. That just isn't very plausible, at least to my knowledge. datkidpatrick you misunderstood the article... they referenced a time where a bulk reseller's phones were black listed... but now it is happening to a bunch of random sellers that decided to sell the phone... Richard Gao The bulk reseller's phones weren't blacklisted at that time. It is entirely possible that these are the same phones. datkidpatrick i purchased mine straight from project fi... sold it 3 months ago and the seller told me the other day it was blacklisted... and yes my mistake.. the bulk resellers email's were blocked or something like that... Cael Did you pay off the phone before you sold it? datkidpatrick yes i did... Corey Kinard So they're punishing someone that fully paid for a device from you, who fully owned the device? They're legally allowed to just fully break something they've already sold and have no right to? This is worse than when carriers wouldn't unlock phones... datkidpatrick im still giving google the benefit of doubt that it was a mistake... they just need to fix it PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ You'll easily win in small claims court if you have to refund and take the phone back. PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ What kind of financing plan did you have? They were first sold in Oct. 22 2016 and this is only May 2017. I seem to remember 24 month financing or 12 month financing. You paid your phone off three months ago and already had sold it on Swappa for some time? datkidpatrick ya youre allowed to pay it off early... PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ Maybe that's what caused the error at Fi in blacklisting by accident. datkidpatrick ya that doesn't make any sense... but it got fixed this morning by google... NeverrKnowsBest I see that now. Thanks for the clarification. In any case, there has to be something in common with these blacklisted phones, I don't think Google/Project Fi would blacklist all second hand phones, I don't think that's very plausible. Corey Kinard Do you really need to think straight when you are in competition for largest company in the world? They probably got algorithms looking for shit and those algorithms mess up. 4Ui812 That's pretty shitty Google. David Bowline Is it really? What's shitty is the people buying in bulk just to make an easy buck and therefore screwing people over. Swappa needs to go after these people. jonzey231 Yeah but if I bought a Pixel LAST YEAR and wanted to sell it no in preparation for the next Pixel or the OP5, for example, my customer may get screwed even though it was just an innocent buy and resell. Max Uh? That's not what happened here... so far this situation seems to be the result of a reseller elaborate plan to evade tax and sell the scarce phone for a bigger profit. This wasn't an individual reselling his/her own phone. jonzey231 Uh? I know that it was originally caused by the douche bags in NJ, but now it's affecting regular people. David Bowline No they won't. I'll bet you can call Google and set it up at the time. Use your noggin and quit jumping to conclusions before the fact. jonzey231 But you saying that is also jumping to conclusions, just on the other side of the argument. If you want to argue me, call Google and play it out. Report your findings here. Otherwise, your words mean no more or less than mine. 4Ui812 That's called capitalism. No one is forcing you to buy it. What Google needs to do is fix all the reported issues with that shitty phone. As for the limited supply of said phone , again that's Google's fault (hell , I wouldn't be surprised if Google intentionally limted the supply ... That's a play out of nintys handbook) Duder12 I have a pixel. There is nothing wrong with my phone. I love it. SirCanealot But I have a Pixel and it is broken. Surely this is not possible to exist in reality? :O :O :O David Bowline If Google is selling phones to a specific customer, who then turns around and sells them en masse, how is Google to know what was sold legally and what was stolen? Google has every right to blacklist those phones. Nobody forced anyone to buy a phone from some jerk on swappa. Its the responsibility of the middle man seller to take care of the problem, not Google. This isn't rocket science here. 4Ui812 You're right , it's not rocket science. If the phone is reported as stolen then it's ok to black list the IMEI. This story makes no mention of phones being stolen. Therefore like I said.... That's pretty shitty Google. A Person It may suck, but who is to decide how my money is spent? kbbl Caveat emptor. SeanPR11 Or.... don't buy your phone from a New Jersey Douchebag. If people don't buy from them, they will stop doing this bullshit. It sucks that regular people are caught in the middle (which happens all too often). It seems Swappa should have known these phones were out there (given the business they are in) and flagged them with the IMEI checker. Alex Excuse them for doing whatever they like with a product they purchased. Pfff David Bowline Then Google can assume that they were stolen and blacklist them. It's not Googles fault here. JFC. SeanPR11 Amen. Ryan from GroupTweet Yes, its shitty. If anything Google should go after the reseller, not the innocent legitimate customers that bought the devices and who are now punished because their phones are blacklisted. Alexander Z Great Swappa can't GO after anyone. Maybe suspend/revoke their account but that's it. My trusted seller hasn't been any help at all with the blacklisted pixel I bought. It's so messed up!! T4rd Saw the site/forum owner of a site I frequent get hit with this on his Pixel this week too. Crazy how the Pixel is being plagued with all sorts of extraneous issues. They can't stay in stock, forcing people to buy second hand, then they get black listed because of some weird policy Google has with Project Fi phones. Max Well being out of stock has nothing strange coming from a Google phone, that's been their main issue for a few years now (Nexus), and it happens even to Apple on launch but the difference is that they're a lot better ramping up production afterwards. This blacklisting is really weird, but so far it seems to be potentially related to a shady reseller so we'll have to wait and see if we get more clarification soon. Geoff Johnson As someone from New Hampshire, it's weird to see my state in an AP article, since nothing interesting ever happens here lol. This sucks though because buyers who bought their Pixel 2nd hand months ago now suddenly might get it blacklisted? J.J. Holy f. That is terrible. So random guy buys a second hand pixel (because Google was out of stock) later gets blacklisted by Google/fi. Gets no help from Google. Never buys a Google phone again. Real smart. Green Dog This on top of the seeming shaky quality of the phones may force me to an iPhone. J.J. I feel ya there but, i just can't do the iPhone thing. Loving this s8+ right now. Duder12 When consumers say this its just sad. Why when you have a difficult time with one android manufacturer immediately think its all Androids and switch to the iPhone? This is how Apple gets tons of customers. Everyone that had a bad time with Samsung just assumed their only other option was iPhone bc MARKETING. Green Dog Because I don't want to have to deal with OS updates through the carrier or a limited phone in terms of LTE bands, as is common for Android phones? People like other phones and I've played with some of them, but I like the Pixel/Nexus lines. But this does give me pause. blenderboy Well, the only offering that competes with iPhone in the world of android is the pixel phone. Samsung displays(hardware in general) are great but software experience can't be compared with iPhone or pixel. It is just sad that they can't keep up with Apple or Google. Google is trying really hard to reach there. I am still using Android because of the platforms openness. Duder12 Fair enough but you know what I mean. You are an exception but A LOT of consumers act this way. Honestly I bought my Pixel through the Google Store last fall and its been solid. I love it. Google needs to sort out the second hand market but these are growing pains. Hardware is still new to them bc the nexus line had help from the OEMs. Now they dont. marcusmarcus2 His comment does not address all Androids. He is only speaking of this one phone. It could be he was between using phones by Google and iPhones and he choose to go with Google's phone. Now with this situation, he decided to go to his second choice. I'm not defending switching to an iPhone over another manufacturer, just pointing out his statement you criticized did not say what you thought it was saying and you were the one to actually apply his statement to all Androids. Just playing the devil's advocate here Alex Because when you pay 7-8-900€ (the price of an iPhone) on an Android phone you expect it to be flawless. And that's normal! However, in real life, regardless if you pay 300 or 800€, Android remains Android, with its notoriously inconsistent battery life, inexplicable wakelocks, unfixed bugs (don't get me stored on the "low priority" bugs with thousands of stars), 2 year updates, etc, etc. tekfr33kn That seems a little dramatic considering that iPhones are far from flawless. You also pay that amount for your average laptop and they aren't flawless. It seems you, or someone else, is holding Android phones to an unrealistic standard. Alex Please don't compare a laptop with an Android phone. It makes absolutely no sense. Isn't it rather that manufacturers (Google being the first of them) increase the prices each year to hallucinating levels with little to no innovation or improvement in user experience. Take the S8 line. Beautiful phones, remarkable design, but a fraction of the cost you pay goes to that crap Bixby that nobody wants tekfr33kn I'll agree with you that Google is artificially raising the price far beyond what it should be but that's basic capitalism and market forces. If the market doesn't want those kinds of prices or can't support it, it won't sell. The issue is that people are actually willing to pay that. iPhones are the primary example. There's about $400 - $500 worth of stuff put in a phone that goes for $800 - $1000 and they still sell like hotcakes. I also agree with you about the S8's and Bixby but again, the market says that the S8 is a hot seller and so Samsung isn't about to change that trend. That kind of makes your argument moot. As for comparing a smartphone to a laptop - if you can't see the comparisons, it's either willful ignorance or you just don't know a thing about electronic devices (specifically smartphones or laptops). In either case, I can't help you with that. The fact is that they share more in common that differences. It's one of the many reasons that development strategies (hardware and software) often translate quite well between them. xyz Uhm, because the phone in question is the overpriced Google phone that is intended to compete with the iPhone and which Google fanboys insist is the greatest Android phone of all time. psychic99 It costs about the same to make a Pixel XL as it does an iphone 7, so why would you expect Google to make less margin than Apple? I will say their ecosystem and support SUCKs compared to Apple, so yeah it should be hundred less because the lifecycle experience of a Pixel will be much worse than Apple and the fact that they artificially end support after 2 years is atrocious. I have 4+ year old Nexus that operate just fine on custom ROMs. And BTW I don't think it is worth it either and happily keep my Nexus 6p for less than 50% the cost. I can't rationalize the price they are asking. Google's support is not consistent. Either they will go over the top to help, or tell you go away you are screwed, There is nothing in the middle, and until you engage them you have no idea if you are going to get help or the hand. Yet another reason they should be hundreds less. Merrill Sampson Just FYI, Google announced at IO a few days ago that they're extending the support cycle on the Pixel from 2 year to 5. marcusmarcus2 Do you have a source for that? https://support.google.com/nexus/answer/4457705?hl=en#nexus_devices Android Version updates: October 2018 Security updates: October 2019 Duder12 Dont forget that apple blocked iPhones that had their fingerprint sensor replaced. Also, dont forget Apple is trying to get a bill banned that will allow consumers to have 3rd parties fix phones. PS: My Pixel is fucking awesome. NexusKoolaid "Dont forget that apple blocked iPhones that had their fingerprint sensor replaced." And this in and of itself was a good thing. With the sensor and the CPU being paired, the sudden appearance of a new sensor having a new signature was deemed to be a security breach. I'm not standing up for Apple here, just calling a spade a spade. And I don't know what information Apple could have shared with 3rd party repair houses (if they were inclined to play nice with them) without compromising security. "PS: My Pixel is fucking awesome." I wish I had one. But they were so hard to get hold of for so long that at this point I'll hang on to my 6P until the Pixel2 is out. psychic99 On Android if you reinstall the O/S or make major modifications they simply invalidate the fingerprint then you have to enter the password manually as a failback. Then you can enrol your fingerprint again. In fact every few days you have to manually enter your pin on N to get into the phone. Sounds like a reasonable method, rather than locking the phone forever. Apple went one step farther. You should go watch youtube... Apple is on a mission to make 3rd party repair a thing of the past. They even specifically make it hard to repair. They want control of the supply chain and dispose of equipment as fast as possible. NexusKoolaid On your first point, there is little control over hardware used to support the platform, so core design decisions are prone to fall back to a software solution. Apple on the other hand has tight control of their hardware and have the option for hardware based solutions, whatever the motivation might be, such as better security or to maintain control of their platform (probably a mix on the two). On your second point, I've read the headlines and seen videos on Youtube (like Louis Rossman). Yeah - their crusade against 3rd party repair sickens me to no small degree. Not just because it would prevent me from seeking out more economical and timely repair of my phone (if I had an iPhone), but because this type of precedent could trickle down to other things I might want to tinker with. Jay Hate to say it but that is the risk people run when you don't buy your devices brand new. J.J. True. But they exasperate said risk artificially for the perceived end goal.... More Profit. The truth is they are doing the exact opposite. This news definitely makes me pause on buying a pixel at all. The Second hand market is real and if i have a bad experience do to Google on a second hand device i will probably not buy new from them when i have the funds. james fuston If you (or the person who sells you a phone) violates the terms of service, you're gonna have a bad time regardless of manufacturer. blenderboy Real question to ask, did Apple ever had similar issue with many devices? hunter2 Probably not since Apple realizes that the perceived strong resale value is a determining factor for many people. Even people who may have never sold a product second hand gain some comfort from the knowledge that they could potentially recoup a lot of their costs if they ever needed to sell. ericshmerick Do the TOS say you can never ever resell the device? Serious question. ekana_stone No the TOS is that you resell as soon as you bought it, so like if you bought from fi cuz it's cheaper and the resold it a little under asking. It's only those phones that were black listed ericshmerick What defines "as soon as?" 5 minutes after purchase? 1 week? 2.8 months? 3 years? marcusmarcus2 Do we have confirmation that it is only those phones that were black listed? Could they have inadvertently black listed other phones from fi? EarlyMon The TOS say that commercial resale is not allowed and lots of them were resold by a private company in a scheme that tried to avoid sales tax. Chris Pretty sure that the Supreme Court just ruled that after you purchase the item the first time that you are allowed to resell it. EarlyMon Commercial resale, not individual resale, is the issue here - a gray market supplier. Look at the number of complaints from people who expected Google support and didn't think that it mattered that they were buying what they thought were the Google version only to find out that they were Verizon models. That's one of the things that the store I referred to evidently did. Who mail orders a Pixel from a New Hampshire store to save the cost of taxes added when we all know what the only outlets are? Santos Chavez It actually does say that isn't allowed, hence why they initially banned several accounts the first time. It was a breach of their TOS, and it still is. It's likely Project Fi saw these phones as stolen and blacklisted them. james fuston "You may only purchase Devices for your personal use. You may not commercially resell any Device, but you may give the Device as a gift." So if you purchase the device and resell it in New (unopened) condition, yeah. Fi could also pretty easily make the case that if you purchased the phone and turned around to sell it before the expiry of the original installment plan that you had purchased it with the intention of reselling. MisterAlex That's still not a commercial sale. If I go to the store, buy a Nintendo Switch, and immediately list it as a brand new Switch on Craigslist, I'm not a commercial seller. I'm still an individual selling something that's fully within my "first sale" rights to sell. james fuston Yeah, that's true if you're reading the second, and only the second, sentence there. The first one pretty clearly states "You may only purchase Devices for your personal use" MisterAlex If you think that reselling a personally owned item goes beyond the bounds of personal use, you're kidding yourself (and so is anyone who thinks that line of thinking would hold water, legally speaking). First Sale is a very broad consumer protection, my friend. Once you buy something of your own, you can do whatever you want with it, including sell it. (Edit: in the States, anyway.) james fuston Yep! Totally fine for you to sell it. Also totally fine for Google to deactivate your phone when you've done something you agreed not to do at the time of purchase. It's then legally on you to prove that they overstepped. MisterAlex You're clearly not parsing what I'm posting. Selling privately owned property is within the bounds of "personal use." james fuston Seeing as Google specifically included a clause about gifting, I'd venture to say they disagree with you. MisterAlex That's fine. Sony also disagreed that it had done anything wrong by removing Other OS. james fuston Cool! So we agree that whether or not you believe Google's terms of service to be legal, it's entirely on the customer to take action after being penalized for a violation of said terms of service. MisterAlex It's always up to the wronged party to seek litigation against a wrongdoer. james fuston In that case, I have no idea why you started commenting on legality when I was discussing terms of service violations. Rather, I would have no idea why if this weren't the comment section. MisterAlex A TOS is not a legally binding agreement. You defended enforcement of a TOS when that enforcement went contrary to law. That's why I brought up the comparison to Sony's PS3 lawsuit (which it lost). james fuston I'm not discussing whether terms of service are legally binding. I'm discussing whether or not the action being described (selling the phone) violates the ToS. It does. MisterAlex And my counter was to point out that putting something in a TOS doesn't make it hunky-dory. In fact, it's quite possible for a TOS to violate law. As I've illustrated. bekifft This is where America is so great. Even if the TOS is unenforceable by law, it is technologically enforceable, obviously. So they do it anyway, and now the onus is on you the little guy to get the multinational corporation to knock it off. Vape John most likely carrier issues the blacklisting... so project fi is the culprit psychic99 More profit? The sell them $150 below market rates. That is not free. I don't know what is actually going on but I would suspect that the original owner did something wrong or unethical. To be honest Google's systems are weird. I ported out my nexus5x and it took them almost 3 months to Bill me for the remainder. So maybe the original person cancelled their card, played games with DPP, activated it for one day and did it again. And again. xyz Fortunately, you can just buy an iPhone and get top notch support. hunter2 So the answer is to buy everything new and toss the old device in the landfill? Kind of sad to see how people just roll over and let over-reaching companies basically decimate the second hand market so they can increase their profits. Jay Never said that and you know it. I said this is the risk you take.. It's as simple as that. trixnkix637 That's the risk you take for not buying from reputable sources. Buying used has risks. Sucks he found out the hard way. jb0nez But the article says it's not Google, it's the carrier who blacklisted. Whatever that means... hunter2 That makes no sense. The carrier technically blocks that IMEI on their network, but only after another carrier submits it to the blacklist. It would be like if you SWATTED somebody and then said "it was the police who came to your house with guns not me". pfmiller On top of that this seems like an abuse of the blacklisting system. The system is intended to discourage theft, not as a means for companies to get revenge on their customers. psychic99 That's not true. Companies have been blacklisting devices for years if tos wasn't met. I have bought 3 phones through fi and they are heavily discounted. Google doesn't do that for free they expect you to activate them on fi for more than one day. Also if you are buying a phone from an individual and not a dealer you are taking a risk straight up. I have had friend have their phones blacklisted when they have bought phones from people and then they turned around and reported them as stolen. Swappa is a marketplace not a arbitrator. They are facilitating a sale. You guys need to know the difference. PayPal is your friend. hunter2 That's dumb. The whole point of cancellation fees is to re-coup the cost of subsidies if you break the contract. By going a different route, the only people who are getting punished are the people buying these phones. psychic99 Lots of people don't pay them and I have seen numerous accounts where friends have bought phones and have told me they got a "deal of a lifetime" to find their devices blacklisted and guess what they were people who never paid off their termination fees or have sold them then reported them stolen. And as an individual you need to take responsibility, if you purchase anything through a private transaction you should ask for poof of sale, do they own it, have it put in writing, etc. That way if the seller does something illegal then you have a remedy. This doesn't derisk anything tho. This is good education for people, to know where responsibility lies and the risks of buying from an individual versus an established dealer. In the case of Swappa, you should buy via Paypal, so there is a remedy. You can chargeback your loss if this happens within 6 months (I have done this will unethical sellers), so they are not being punished they are being inconvenienced. But that is the RISK you take buying from an individual. hunter2 I know you want to see Google as the good guy here, but within these comments there are accounts from people who bought outright, and months later sold their Pixel's and now months after that sale are being contacted by the seller about the device being blacklisted. bekifft I think you're missing his point. It's not about Google being the good or bad guy, it's that buying something third party is inherently risky and he's right, you should ask for a chain of evidence that proves the device is legit. Maybe I'm also just tired of people claiming they can find things so cheap online, when most of it is scams like this, and just devalues the whole market. hunter2 You need to look through these comments. There are people here who bought their phones directly from Fi and after switching carriers their fully paid off phones have been blacklisted. They were the original owners and these phones were never sold. There are also people here who bought phones, used them for months, and sold them after they were fully paid off. These people are saying that the proper they sold the phones to are now coming back and telling them they're blacklisted. bekifft In that case that is indeed disturbing. I am a Fi subscriber though I bought my phone direct from the Google store. Sounds like someone made a big mistake on the back end. Lance Biddle I bought my phone from Project Fi, and it has become blacklisted after changing to another carrier. Google is definitely the bad guy right now IMO pfmiller Just because other companies have been doing it, doesn't mean that it's not an abuse of the system. It's clearly not what the blacklisting system was intended for. Lance Biddle How about when you buy the phone from Project Fi, decide to switch carriers and the phone you outright own becomes black listed. I cannot connect to the Verizon service I'm paying for. And Verizon cannot do anything about. And Google/Project Fi isn't. I've wasted way too much time on the phone trying to get this resolved. They have told me it could be 2-5+ days to get it fixed. WTF!! Never Google again. Never. J.J. I'm sorry. That sucks hard. ProductFRED Considering the original seller probably isn't going to pay people back, all Google did was fuck over a bunch of legitimate customers. iPhone reselling is also a big issue, especially on new releases, but you don't see Apple doing this. J.J. Agree 💯. Most of these customers involved (who probably have had hardware and software issues already on top​ of this) will never buy a pixel again! Cassidy James Blaede Just for the record, the majority of Pixel users likely never have hardware or software issues. I, my mom, and a couple of my friends have Pixels and haven't had any issues. You probably hear about issues on Reddit a lot because the only reason to visit the Pixel subreddit is to complain. 🙃 Jordan L no issues here too. J.J. Not a redditer lol, but many other sites show the issues(as low as they may be) and if you were on the fence about spending that kind of money, these stories alone may sway many Duder12 Yep. Just like iphone touch disease and early shutdowns. Tr3ple Never had those issues. xyz That's true. I personally don't know anyone who has been murdered. Therefore, no one gets murdered. Cassidy James Blaede I'd wager that the majority of people don't get murdered. 😉 Written Description My Pixel XL has performed flawlessly since its purchase and it's my first Android phone after using every iPhone from the first generation on. Google's AI is better, its cloud storage is infinitely better, and I don't see going back to Apple anytime soon. J.J. I'm glad you have not had issues.... Others however have Duder12 Not me. Corey Kinard 3rd Np. Duder12 Mines been great... atl3630 great here too. Cael Apple is not a "carrier". ProductFRED Neither is Google. They just use other carriers' networks. Either way, that isn't justification for what they're doing. Unless they plan on replacing everyone's Pixel (which looks like a hard no), they fucked over a lot of legitimate customers. I buy my devices off of swappa most of the time. Tell me how I would get this fixed if neither the seller nor Google want to take responsibility. marcusmarcus2 Google is an MVNO. Per https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-an-mvno-cell-phone-carrier-578673 "An MVNO is a cell phone carrier (such as a prepaid wireless carrier) that typically does not have its own network infrastructure and licensed radio spectrum" Apple is not even an MVNO carrier. drksilenc fi is a carrier... JD With Fi Google is a Carrier. Mitch Gray This just happened to my fiance's phone. I bought it on swappa for her birthday months ago because Google store didn't have any in stock and this morning it is blacklisted. I'm so furious. I have had every Google phone since the Galaxy Nexus and because of this policy I will never buy another phone of theirs. She is now stranded without a phone and has no way of using it for work at the busiest time of the year for her (she is a teacher and it's graduation week). Who do I contact about this? We shouldn't be punished because someone gamed the system. J.J. I feel so bad for you. I hope you get it resolved. This is an atrocity! J.J. Should definitely hassle fi/Google and let them know if they don't resolve you will never buy and tell everyone you know not to buy and so on jibust No, stop don't tell them that, they might not withstand the shock of loosing them. /S T4rd I would contact the seller of the phone and/or Swappa if they're the service you went through. If they're no help somehow, then contact Paypal if that's how you paid for it. Google isn't going to unblacklist the phone regardless of what you say to them. It's virtually impossible for a phone to be unblacklisted once it has happened, so you're going to have to just get a refund and buy another phone. A Person Good luck with that. I am hesitant to ever buy again from Swappa.. and I used to love, love, love them. I purchased a device that was blatantly not as described. I then contacted Swappa and they instructed me that it is now between me and the seller. So I contacted the seller via the sale page and was basically told: "ummmm, nah". datkidpatrick at that point you could have went thru paypal and filed a claim... T4rd That's why you buy from reputable sellers. The few minor issues I've had on there were resolved quickly. atl3630 yes, same here. To date I've never had a swappa problem that didn't get resolved and the people have been very helpful. Don't blame swappa for shitty sellers. Buy from reputable sellers (like me). yankeesusa Swappa only helps communicating. To resolve any issues you must file a PayPal claim. datkidpatrick contact the seller and see if they can contact project fi/google... King_Android Ijs, BBB is an extremely powerful tool in order to get your voice heard from Corporate asap...... Stephen Hicks If the phone is under warranty still, file an RMA claim and state the bluetooth isn't working correctly on the device and that you've already tried factory resetting the phone as well as reconnected all the bluetooth devices with no improvement. Might work? njn There is no warranty for second hand phones. JRock I purchased a bootlooping 6P off eBay for cheap, erasing/flashing firmware had same result, RMA'd to Huawei and they promptly sent me a brand new one. Mark Depending on the credit card you used to buy the phone, you might have an extended warranty that might cover this. atl3630 You can get your money back. Contact the seller through swappa and tell them the issue. They will likely tell you it's been to long, I don't care, etc. If so, then file a PayPal claim. You have six months PayPal protection. Document that the phone no longer works and send it back to the seller with tracking. Then PayPal will refund you money, no matter what the seller says. M3D1T8R But doing this will just end up screwing over the seller. PayPal will simply take the money from their account and refund it to the buyer. So that's not fair to the seller either. PayPal's "seller protection" is a fraud. And their customer service is a total joke. They should be boycotted. atl3630 How does that screw over the seller? The seller screwed himself when he sold the phone. His beef is with ProjectFi, not the buyer. Frankly the buyer shouldn't have to deal with this crap since buyers have no way to determine the history of a phone. The seller sold a phone that stopped working. That's on them. M3D1T8R Because, obviously, the seller doesn't necessarily know the history and every previous owner of every phone. What if it's a phone someone bought previously used. They used it for a while just fine, and resold it. Then this IMEI block thing happened. atl3630 Yeah, that would suck. But still, it's not the buyer's fault. If something happens and somebody gets cheated out of $500+ then you better bet people are going to exercise whatever option they can to recover their money. PayPal protection would do that for them in the first 6 months. ericshmerick So anyone who sells a phone is on the hook for its functionality until the end of time? GTFO of here with that. It's ridiculous and you know it. atl3630 Six months, moron. PayPal protection is 6 months. Like it or not, facts. Stop being a little bitch. Roh_Mish What if the seller had bought directly from google. AP mentioned about the trains but there doesn't appear to to be a link between this and that fraud. Also there are many cases where buyer on PayPal will request a reverse and never return the product, screwing over the seller. And PayPal won't do anything about this. vn33 That really sucks .. .especially to someone near and dear to you. I would be beyond furious! Hope everything works out!! Duder12 Swappa will cover you here. You are fine. Get the ball rolling. Anwar Imraan Lucas To me it seems that the original buyer had reported his credit card lost or stolen and is disputing charges on his card which in terms maybe blacklisting those devices as stolen.. blindexecutioner You do Google the service of endless beta testing their software on a way overpriced phone and they blacklist you. Nice. Lawrence Good, that is what you get for buying the Bezel XL ericshmerick OH YOUUUU!!1 theadamsegal Yet another reason I will not buy a Google device again. Tiberian For the record: Kyle Bennett is the owner and founder of HardOCP, not just a simple writer for the site. ;) Richard Gao Did not know that. Thanks! datkidpatrick this happened by to me as well... i sold my pixel 3 months ago and the buyer just informed me it was blacklisted... i had no clue project fi was doing this and legit thought the buyer was trying to scam me... i contacted project fi support and was advised it was escalated to be removed from the blacklist... i paid off the phone before i sold it... this is definitely a mistake by google/project fi... they should be correcting this soon... Jordan L Can a carrier just randomly blacklist IMEIs?! I guess so. I was reading this thread thinking 'well, people probably just bought a stolen Pixel unknowingly' but your case proves this wrong. Navneet Suresh Shitty move Google ! :/ Jay If this happened to me, I'd just return the phone to the seller, get refunded, and make them have to deal with this. Swappa made a huge fucking deal about refunding buyers after the Note7 debacle and it should be the same thing here. freshprince_87 I hope that Kyle guy reads your comment. This may help him Jay Honestly, Swappa needs to be pushing this harder. I sold my Note7 last year and despite the fact that the buyer could have gone and gotten the refund from T-Mobile themselves, they chose to take Swappa up on their suggestion of getting the refund from me. (Add to this that Swappa said if I didn't agree to the refund, they'd "suggest" the buyer take the issue up with PayPal as the device was not sold as advertised. Seriously..) datkidpatrick it isn't the sellers fault... and its something that can be fixed... Jay I fail to see how this isn't the seller's fault for trying to game the system and make a profit. This sure as hell isn't Google's fault.. so who do you want to blame then? The unsuspecting buyers? datkidpatrick it is googles fault... the point they referred to in november is completely separate from the issue happening now... the issue happening now is many pixel phones that were sold and originated from fi is getting blacklisted... i sold my pixel after paying it of legit and it just got blacklisted... now please tell me how i tried to game the system... Jay For all I know, you could be one of those shady scalpers too who tried to make a profit by gaming the system. The burden of fixing this issue should still lie on the sellers. If someone wants their money back, they have every right to make you do the legwork of figuring out how you'll make your money back. datkidpatrick I contacted project fi for the buyer and it is escalated... again the point is it wasn't my fault... marcusmarcus2 If you are just trying to sell 1 phone that you got and paid for without trying to "game the system" it is not your fault, but it is your responsibility as the seller to try and resolve the issue, which it sounds like you are doing. Who's fault is it? Hard to tell until Google releases a comment about why this is happening. Did they block these by mistake? Then it is Googles fault. Are they doing it to block the bulk buyers that were "gaming the system" and just went over board and blocked some extra phones that were not part of those that gamed the system? Then it would be the fault of Google and those that gamed the system that caused Google to make the choice. hunter2 I wouldn't say it's his responsibility. He's selling a device. If the maker of that device decides to flip a kill switch in 18 months and disable every device out there then why blame him. Google is flipping a kill switch an all kinds of devices (just below there is a comment from a guy who bought and paid for his phone, then later switched carriers and had his originally bought phone killed). Trying to blame middle men here is crazy. marcusmarcus2 I'm not blaming the seller. Please re-read. I said the fault is with Google if they are the ones that decided to black list them. It is the sellers responsibility to try figure out why a device they sold is blacklisted. If they did nothing wrong, then they should be able to get it unblacklisted by working with Google. From the looks of some of the comments on here, it looks like the buyer would not be able to get the device of the black list but the seller should be able to. Again, I'm not blaming the middle man. There is a difference between fault and responsibility. Fault sounds like it is fully on Google. Responsibility goes across everyone though with some having more responsibility. Buyer has some responsibility to report the issue to the seller instead of just reporting it to paypal. Seller has more responsibility than the seller because they would be the one who would be able to work with Google/fi to get it off the black list. Google/fi would have even more responsibility to explain why devices are being blacklisted and getting devices off the black list if they should not be on there. Max As a somewhat frequent seller/buyer on Swappa and Ebay I can say that this is definitely the sellers responsibility to fix the problem or promptly accept a return for a refund otherwise this isn't so different from a bait and switch situation. datkidpatrick how is it a bait and switch if i paid off a phone legit and decided to sell it after... 3 months later it gets blacklisted... this is a mistake by google and its their responsibility to fix... Max If you paid off the phone legit and didn't do anything shady then it wouldn't have been blacklisted and if it was you, as the original buyer, are the one with more authority to contact Google, not the second hand buyer, therefore it's your responsibility to fix it. The buyer with a blacklisted phone has zero reasons to believe that you were truthful in your description even if you were. datkidpatrick well i did contact project fi for the buyer and it is escalated... Max Then you're doing the right thing (taking responsibility) and hopefully this gets resolved quickly by Fi! Although I don't know if they can just un-blacklist a phone? Hopefully they can. ericshmerick If I buy a product from a retail store and 92 days later it has an issue, guess what they will tell me when I show up barking for a refund? Yeah, pound sand kid. That's what they will say. So why do Swappa sellers suddenly have the responsibility to refund forever ala Costco? I get people are pissy at the situation, but the seller isn't responsible for Google's shadyness here. Max We're not talking about "an issue" here because that's what warranties are for, we're talking about a phone reported as lost/stolen after being sold this could potentially mean a fraudster that didn't fully pay the phone or a thief that sold a stolen phone, I doubt any serious retailer would do that... By the way that's what buyer protections are for, Paypal has six months of protection and credit card providers can be very flexible if you explain your case well and you're in the right. If a retailer pull something like this they would never win a chargeback.

If a retailer pull something like this they would never win a charge back and the manufacturer and distributor would never be involved in the original transaction or charge back, it would be up to the retailer to go after the manufacturer or distributor. ericshmerick But nothing shady or illegal is going on here. If I and the original buyer and I use it on project fi for two months, then decide to sell it. How does that suddenly implicate me as being some sort of shady criminal? I would simply be selling a legally purchased piece of hardware that was paid in full. Max Can you please elaborate how the buyer knows that you sold "a legally purchased piece of hardware that was paid in full" if he has a blacklisted phone reported as lost/stolen in the hands? Good luck convincing the buyer, Paypal and a Bank that you're in the right in such a situation... Luxferro If they sold you shady (stolen or not legal) products you'd be dealing with them. tnt These are not devices being bought from an official retailer. There's no need to question the history of a device bought from Costco. Swappa (and Ebay and Craigslist for that matter) are not the same type of market. It's the seller's responsibility to know the history (as much as possible anyway) of the devices they're selling. freshprince_87 I guess it's safer to buy a Verizon Google Pixel instead if you intend on reselling it later. So the future buyer isn't screwed by Google. That is such a ridiculous policy drksilenc have to have a line with verizon to do that though. Wendell Brown Apparently not, this dude says his WERE Verizon phones that were locked.... https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/6d2yse/2_of_my_3_google_pixel_phones_blacklisted_on_the/ Me Google is just shooting themselves in the foot at this point with the Pixel Yan Qin I just sold my Pixel XL and switch to Galaxy S8, I do think I was out of my mind that I actually bought Pixel at full price. Jordan L anyone resell a project fi phone NOT through Swappa and have it blacklisted? maybe ProjectFi blacklisted only Swappa phones(still a strange move if it was on purpose) Jagermeister 2 of my 3 Pixel phones showed up blacklisted 2 days ago. I made a reddit post yesterday of my issue. I though it was part of an insurance fraud scam. https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/6d2yse/2_of_my_3_google_pixel_phones_blacklisted_on_the/ I had originally though our phones were from Verizon not Google Fi. We were happy Pixel customers that are now considering purchasing different phones because Google can report as stolen whenever they feel a Google Fi device was not transferred to a new owner per their TOS. How can any user purchasing a pre-owned or "new" Google Pixel be sure that it isn't a Google Fi device and won't be blacklisted in the future? Max Johnson Note to self, don't buy second hand Google devices. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Note to everyone: Don't buy first hand Google devices. Max Why? Mine works perfectly fine and so far it's the best phone I've ever owned. Dana Yeah, it's fine as long as you don't get it from Project Fi because you can't sell it if you want to upgrade to a new device. Max LOL, what? I simply bought it directly from store.google.com, no issues here and I can provide proof. This is something related to phones sold through Fi. hunter2 Congrats, scroll up one comment and you'll find a guy who's phone is blacklisted despite him being the original owner and being fully paid off. To answer your question of "Why", it's because not everyone is as comfortable gambling with their money as you are. Max 1) It was blacklisted by the carrier, not the manufacturer. 2) It was blacklisted after it was resold, sucks but as far as we know it doesn't affect the original seller, there's a difference there. 3) We don't know yet why this really happened. 4) Even with all of the above, I don't see how it fits in a "Don't buy first hand Google devices." statement. Maybe if you tell me "Don't deal with Project Fi service" I could somewhat agree. hunter2 http://disq.us/p/1iz7ts3 Sorry, should have permalinked the comment since the order is moving per votes. That guy was the original owner and claims to have been paid off. Moved to Verizon at some point and had the device he originally bough directly from Google blacklisted. Max Well that negates my point 2 and sucks even more. But still the blame here points 100% to Project Fi and not the phone itself nor Google as the manufacturer of the phone. Something really strange is happening with Project Fi devices and hopefully they will find out soon if it's an error, incompetence, sabotage or maybe even hacking. hunter2 I guess it depends on how willing you are to absolve the parent company of things a specific branch is doing. It would be like saying "don't blame MS, it's the IE team who makes the browser" during the IE6 days. Max Legally is evident that the responsibility is on Google but if you think that the group in charge of designing and manufacturing the Pixel has any minimal clue about what happens inside the group of the MVNO Project Fi then you're frankly clueless about how such a huge company works. By the way IE and Edge sucks but Visual Studio rocks and I'm liking more Windows 10 recently but I guess I should avoid using everything Microsoft because IE really sucks, right? hunter2 If a decisions like these can be made without going far enough up the chain of command that you're dealing with some higher ups, then I don't really want to know how this company runs. It's enough to tell me that I can't really trust them because you can't really depend on a company keeping in line with their corporate ideals when individual units can work with this much impunity. Avoiding/disliking MS was never about IE sucking. It was about IE being openly hostile and damaging to the web. This complaint was obviously projected at Microsoft themselves since no one believed that the IE team was working in a bubble. I don't know how old you are so maybe you weren't around when all this was going on. It's not about disliking a company because one or some of their many products are inferior. It's about disliking them because they employ user hostile tactics and you don't feel like you can support that (or at the very least want to punish them in the tiny way you can by voting with your wallet). Max So you already got an official response from Google about this? Can you share it? Because so far I have only read guesses about what is happening and nothing official yet. I'm old enough to have used MS-DOS 5 & 6 as well as Windows 3.1. That doesn't change the fact that saying "don't buy anything from a company" based on one division issues is just silly. If Google officially says that all of this was planned then maybe you could have a point, until then you're just stretching facts to prove a weak point. hunter2 I don't need to fill in the facts. I'm saying either way it's bad. The facts are that this happened. Additional facts about why it happened are irrelevant Max Well, if you're happy thinking like that be my guest, I guess some people is unable to see the colors and think the world is black and white. hunter2 For people whom this isn't a mundane thought experiment but are actually in a position where they need to buy a new device (not everyone is able to be without their phone until Google ultimately resolves this); the shades of gray in this scenario don't change their circumstances. The facts are that they have a phone that was remotely disabled. I'm assuming your shades of gray are the how's and why's of that? How is that of any consequence to these people? Steve_Jobroni Shut up, troll. DanSan got em! Matt This will be great for their resale value. ericshmerick Swappa comments: I GEEVE U $200 BUY NOW FINAL OFFERS!! JD Wooooo! Go Pixel, I'm definately not going near any Google hardware with a 1000ft pole now.I may use my 1001ft pole. In Many states, and at least in Canada this is not legal, you can't blacklist a phone for ToS violation. There's a very narrow list of reasons for a device to be blacklisted. Cuong This is a really shitty move from Google. At least sent a notification few days in advance and offer a way to appeal. What if a person was in an emergency situation? Imagine the lawsuit for that, Google. Why customers have to suffer because Google can't control their resellers? ericshmerick 911 always works. segag Thats Fuck all! Snowsky Mountain This may seriously make me rethink my use of Google hardware (especially phones). Stevie Do no evil Google. Do no evil. My Dixie Wrecked Yeah, they got rid of that mandate years ago. Seriously. Look it up. mxwp lol, yeah it was pretty funny. but i give Big G props for being somewhat honest about that. "hmm, we're huge now and so just cannot help to do some evil" Corey Kinard Just looked​ it up. Looks like it's still in place for Google. Alphabet's is different l though. It's "do the right thing." Sruly J Bought an unlocked Pixel yesterday for $334. Before I send it in to get checked and fixed by Google, I really should check the IMEI (normally I'd have the IMEI first, but the seller didn't give it to me). Michael D’Ambrosio "Someone with an answer." That'll get you far with Tech support. Smh vn33 Does the blacklisted phone works out of US, say in Canada? I assume yes, if it's the carriers that are doing the blacklisting. that said, it would really dampen my desire for a phone from Google. Stevie I am crossing my fingers that they don't come after my Nexus 6. Already bought and activated. There's no going back right? speedy1979 So to clarify google is randomly blacklisting any google pixel that is resold. I actually considered buying a ProjectFi device sometime ago; so glad I didn't go through with it. Kris Crowley I have fi service. When you buy a phone through fi you got a discount or a phone that you can't get through the Google store if you want. There is a disclaimer that if you buy it and never activate it that you will be charged additional Monies within 30 days. Now without knowing isn't possible that A the phone was bought at a discount and B the additional fee was levied but never paid? trixnkix637 Know the risks of buying used people. Do your homework. Asking where the seller bought the phone originally could've prevented all of this. Can't blame Google because someone tried to game the system both ways. marcusmarcus2 Know the risks of not using commas, people. You should never buy people, whether they are used or new. Rony Hmmm, is there a difference between a new and a used person. I've scoured the forums and haven't got a clear answer. marcusmarcus2 You would have to ask them before you buy them. They usually know when they've been used. But again, you should not buy any people. Def Ref But if you try to rent people, you start hearing words like "solicitation" and that's no fun. marcusmarcus2 Don't rent them either. While we are at it. Do not borrow, loan or steal people. Def Ref Is enticement allowed in your no fun world? Asking for a friend. marcusmarcus2 I don't see a problem with enticement as long as that enticement does not lead to stealing people. "No fun world"? You mean my world where I think people should not be viewed or treated as items/property? If yes, then yeah, I guess it is a no fun world. Def Ref Lighten up, Francis. marcusmarcus2 Lighten up, Francis? https://38.media.tumblr.com/39ef7347a58e308e67a5bd01cd124431/tumblr_nsld6lafvE1qh124lo1_500.gif Def Ref https://youtu.be/0OnpkDWbeJs That the title is misspelled AND mispunctuated is bonus. trixnkix637 Didn't NY and NV allow for the renting of people or is that wishful thinking? Asking for a friend. Rod This was so good, I had to sign into Disqus to upvote. trixnkix637 Buying people has been around for ages. Can't just stop now because of commas. marcusmarcus2 Buying used has been around for ages. trixnkix637 And so has it's risks. ericshmerick Wow I feel bad for the Swappa sellers who are getting PayPal charge backs right about now. Alexander Z Great This was the response I received. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/948da6656e25823e8dc529c4571fbc2d347f5e820ee9b7c91844d48c9745a112.png DanSan owner of the device ≠ person who purchased. way to go google. InnocentEd News flash this could happen with any phone from any manufacturer on any network that is resold used. I've had it happen with 2 iPhones and Apple could have cared less. You buy used, you take the risk. It's amazing how even credited tech journalists assume devices on Swappa are always going to be 100% safe. If Project Fi were not allowed to be resold via T&S then it's no diff than blacklisting a resold stolen phone...they had every right. Bewear This is why we can't have nice things. Rony Honestly this makes total sense. Its technically stealing the phone if you buy it for a discounted price and you dont activate it and sell it again. I think they made the right move. raffr It's not "technically" stealing. If you purchase a product at the price requested, you did not steal it. IF, big IF, in your purchase agreement it states you cannot resell the phone without activating it first, then google has a case. Serge Cebrian if you are paying for the service ... you are still paying for it even if you keep your older phone or a better phone if you want to unless you stop paying then its stealing ... but not if you keep the service// marcusmarcus2 They could have blacklisted these phones for that reason. But they could have also been overzealous when blacklisting devices and blacklisted numerous other devices that people did not do that with. It may have been the right move to block those that did do that, but if they inadvertently blocked additional devices, then hopefully they make the right move and unblock those devices that should not have been blocked. newtonfb Not new. Wife got a 5x on swappa. Phone was originally on FI but never taken off the account. We tried to activate it on FI but they did we couldn't until the owner released the phone? It worked fine on any other carrier. Had to get a new 5x Lance Biddle I paid off my pixel through project fi. I recently switched to Verizon. Yesterday Verizon notified me that my phone had been reported as stolen! When I awoke this morning my service had been disabled by Verizon. The support from Project Fi has been abysmal. What do I do to fix this? Corey Kinard Go to Reddit. Get ready for talks with the Better Business Bureau. Keep contacting Fi, keep screenshotting all the correspondences, you get all the buyers info in order to prove you are the original device owner. You don't fix this, you didn't cause it to break. Google fixes this. Everyone affected just has to light a fire under their ass. tnt Keep pushing / escalating with Project Fi. Ryan from GroupTweet I bought a Pixel from Tradeport USA (NH based company, shit!) about 3 months ago. The phone is on T-mobile right now and still currently working (fingers crossed). From my interpretation this appears only to be affecting Pixels bought through Google Fi - and perhaps not ones bought via Google Play store unlocked? Is that correct? Is there anyway I can check to see if my pixel was in fact sold via Google FI vs Google Play? Really hoping I don't wake up to a bricked phone in the next couple mornings... Sruly J You could contact Google, provide them with the IMEI, and they could let you know if it was bought through Google Play. Ryan from GroupTweet Thanks - but don't want to risk tipping them off that my phone should be on the blacklist :( Sruly J But wouldn't they know anyways if it should be blacklisted? I mean, how else would they have blacklisted so many phones this week? lauriedesautels So I have the Pixel and was planning on selling it via Swappa after my credits end from another phone. They ended up giving me a brand new Pixel XL but their service has become horrible where I live. So please correct me if I am wrong but if the Pixel is paid off and I switch carriers/ my Pixel is a paperweight? (I don't plan on using the phone on another carrier after 3 mo). ericshmerick According to this place, you can never sell it. You must carry it with you to your grave. Robert Montoya I have a Pixel that is currently blacklisted as of 5/23/2017 I bought it from Swappa... Google says they will lift the ban in 24 to 48 hours... That was 24 hours ago.. Phone still Blacklisted Wendell Brown I must have missed where it was shown that these deactivated phones were on Project Fi. As best I can tell, the only link to Fi is from an OLD article about the guy reselling phones several months ago. Is there any proof that this is in any way Fi related? MadJoe I have to say, if Google ever blacklisted my phone in a misguided sour-grapes attempt to punish the person who sold it to me, and without compensating me for it I would be rather angry. It would also be the absolute last Google product I ever purchased. As it is, this story has me glad I don't own anything more than a $25 Chromecast that I never use. I was seriously considering the Pixel 2 as my next phone, but not any more. If they were going to be such babies about the phones being resold, they should have vetted their buyers a little better. Corey Kinard It doesn't look like they were making any money off of you in the first place... Second-hand buyers/ bargain hunters rarely go out and pre-order $800 phones. Maybe you're different. They're definitely fucking up, but considering how little the pixel one sold and how much money they make I'm not sure they'll care about this any which way the wind blows. Same way Apple can just outright tell their customers to go fuck themselves over certain problems. MadJoe The problem is that too many people will ignore a company's unscrupulous behavior. If more of us would punished them by taking away access to our wallets, they'd think twice about trying to screw us. But people are lazy and lack commitment. So you're absolutely right, Google won't feel any hit by my deciding not to buy any more of their shit because a shit-ton of blind lemmings will gladly line up to jump off that spot on the cliff I chose not to use. And when a couple of them get screwed, they will cry "why isn't anyone else interested in helping me?" as the rest of the heard ignore them. On the bright side, the cycle will continue ad nauseum until I'm in a hole in the ground. Bruce Considering the ridiculous amount they are charging for the phones (Apple pricing without the Apple level support), this just about kills the resale value for a Pixel. Who the hell is going to buy a used phone for $500+ (because the original cost is so high) if their phones get blacklisted months later. And who the hell is going to buy the phones at the original price, when resale value will drop like a rock. And this doesn't even take into account all the BS that comes with the phone to begin with. 2 years of guaranteed OS updates. Hardware issues (Bluetooth, speakers, water resistance...) which don't get acknowledged amid finger pointing. Insufficient inventory even if they were open to replacements. The 128GB version (the 32GB is too little and the 64 GB doesn't exist) costs almost a $1000. The first time they tried this with the Nexus One, it didn't go well. This doesn't seem to be going much better. The Galaxy Nexus couldn't be upgraded because of drivers. The only real hits have been the Nexus 5 and the 6P. UniBroW *clutches iPhone 7 plus despite it's inferiority to android* Tj Hariharan Wait, do we actually KNOW that the phones that are blacklisted were originally purchased for reselling for profit? All i got from this article was that the phone was originally purchased from Project Fi.. RTNDO128 My phone was effected by this. I've been having issues with no T-Mobile service for the past couple of days on Project Fi. After reading this article, I used the Swappa IMEI checker and what do you know, my phone is reported "lost/stolen". I bought my Pixel on eBay at the beginning of January. Now I'm beyond their 30 day gaurentee. What an absolute clusterfuck. RTNDO128 My phone was effected by this. I've been having issues with no T-Mobile service for the past couple of days on Project Fi. After reading this article, I used the Swappa IMEI checker and what do you know, my phone is reported "lost/stolen". I bought my Pixel on eBay in the middle of February. Now I'm beyond their 30 day guarantee. What an absolute clusterfuck. Y2J You have 180 days in Paypal. RTNDO128 Thanks, I filed a claim with them. Hopefully this situation is covered. Max Did you contact first the seller? Otherwise it's a dick move to file a claim without first giving the seller the opportunity to see if he collaborates... RTNDO128 Thanks for your opinion. As stated, I'm beyond the 30 day eBay guarantee window. I created a "dispute" through the PayPal Resolution Center, which sends a message directly to the seller. PayPal is totally uninvolved with the dispute until I choose to escalate, which will only happen if I cannot get this resolved with the seller first. I just want to have our conversations documented in the event that the seller does not want to deal with this situation. Ken Kinda weird Google said that IMEI can't be blocked by manufacturer, I'm sure that's true. But what when manufacturer is also technically the carrier? Da_James Are you saying that "buying" a device in the USA doesn't mean you own it? Just SUE. Steve_Jobroni > as it's the carrier and not the manufacturer that has the ability to blacklist devices Do people not read the full article anymore? There seems to be a lot of Jabroni's blaming Google when it's the carrier that can only do the blacklisting. Sir_Brizz But that carrier is Project Fi, aka Google... Aleksandr Ivanov Change IMEI, problem solved! AbdulB1 lol Cassidy James Blaede I'd be interested in hearing how widespread this actually is, and a response from Google. My mom bought a Pixel from Swappa because Google was out of stock, and she's been loving it. I'd hate for her phone to become a brick because of this. Leonardo Baez I see a class action demand on the horizon? Đức Thành I'm a die-hard Google fan, but wow does Google need some fixing. justmy2pennies2012 There is one simple way Google can prevent the second hand market from making a profit. 1. Provide enough stock for all those who want to purchase the device! :) Bonus: Price the device accrodingly!! I gave up trying to buy one new from VZW and the Play Store. MisterAlex Did getting a Pixel phone through Fi require signing away your rights regarding "first sale?" And is that enforceable? RayNeverLearns You are Android Police. You might want to stay more up to date on this story and keep your readers updated, especially one that has a big impact on one of the purest Android flagships. http://www.techspot.com/news/69452-pixel-phones-project-fi-showing-up-blacklisted.html datkidpatrick happy to announce the phone i sold has been taken off the blacklist after communicating with project fi... so if you're affected by this contact google or more specifically project fi support... RayNeverLearns I believe Project Fi has done this for all affected Pixels. I didn't contact the person who sold it to me (Craigslist 7 months ago... wouldn't know where to even start) yet my phone was whitelisted earlier today. A little pain and it took almost 3 days, but a good resolution. datkidpatrick thats great... happy it's fixed... Amir What an idiotic move by Google. That's suicide. HardWired I wonder how long before Tesla implement a similar system in their cars :) Sorry you signed an agreement, the car has been disabled because you decided to sell it to a used car salesman for resale. Same sort of punishment that should not be legal.

Zeman   @phonescooper updated Yesterday, 12:19 PM Updated: Updated with several corrections concerning LTE and GPS. The Wear24 from Verizon is among the first to support Android Wear 2.0 from Google. The wearable is a classy-looking smartwatch that offers LTE-based calling and messaging integration with your main mobile number. If you use an Android handset, the Google-focused Wear24 can handle vital communications when reaching for your phone isn't ideal. AD       article continues below... Background Smartwatches are struggling. Two years ago it seemed they were on a trajectory to eliminate dedicated fitness wearables (and possibly even smartphones) to become the wrist-borne computers we all thought we wanted. They can answer messages! They can track your workouts! They can set calendar appointments! Then reality struck. Smartwatches are neat, but they can't always replace a smartphone. Interacting with the small screen is often frustrating. Battery life can be inconsistent. Some are big and bulky, while others aren't powerful enough. The market has been topsy-turvy since Day One, particularly where Google's Android Wear platform is concerned. Google hoped Android Wear 2.0 would solve many of these problems. It promised to deliver a more powerful set of features that would be available across a wider range of wearables. Then reality struck again. Google's Android Wear 2.0 platform arrived in February, nearly four months later than originally planned, and nine months after it was first announced in May 2016. The revised operating system includes, among other things, a refreshed user interface and tools such as the Google Assistant, an on-device storefront, and better text input. The number of new smartwatches with support for Android Wear 2.0 are few and far between. In fact, all the models announced so far would fit on a single arm. The Wear24 from Verizon Wireless is one of them. Not only is the Wear24 among the first to support Android Wear 2.0, it's also among the first to include LTE for mobile data on the go. This is a big deal for Android watches, which have always required a nearby smartphone for network access. Are Android Wear 2.0 and LTE the turnkey features smartwatches need to finally spur real consumer interest? Hardware Google-based smartwatches tend to fall into one of two camps: "sport" or "classic". The former are generally made from plastics and silicone, while the latter typically feature metal and leather. Where about half of the new Android wearables focus purely on fitness, the rest are content to exist as conservative-styled arm jewelry. The Wear24 is trying to be both. Wear24 Hardware   The main casing of the watch is formed by stainless steel. It comes in a raw, unfinished look, as well as gunmetal gray and rose gold. I found the unfinished steel to be the most appealing of the three, though that's not saying much. It is bright and shiny, and yet generic and somewhat boring. The plain shape of the Wear24 features smooth contours, a thin bezel, and just a single button on the right side. The quality of the brushed metal finish is not in question, but the Wear24 looks like a million other watches. I suppose that's the point. The Wear24's metal chassis would go really well with a leather strap to complete the classic look. It's too bad Verizon selected a cheap, sport-like silicone (rubber) strap to wrap around your wrist. The silicone strap is crappy. It's perfectly functional, yet it cheapens the entire experience. Worse, you can't swap it out for a different strap. (Instead of standard pins, the strap is secured to the watch with custom screws and a contoured shape where it adjoins the chassis.) Verizon says the strap was designed this way because it contains the LTE antennas. This is an unfortunate engineering decision, as it directly impacts usability. On a personal level, I had an allergic reaction to the Wear24's strap and the Wear24 gave me a rash after wearing it a few days. The strap of the Apple Watch did the same thing (both are rubbery). The rash issue makes the Wear24 a non-starter for me; I can't wear it. Apple, by way of comparison, was happy — and able — to swap out the silicon strap for a nylon strap at no cost to me. Verizon can't do that with the Wear24's custom strap design. At 0.53 inches thick, the Wear24 is a beefy wearable. It's not as ridiculously huge as the Samsung Gear S3, but it's not a svelte timepiece, either. The chassis has a rounded, plastic underbelly that I found comfortable against my skin. The strap has more than enough holes in it, which allowed me to find just the right fit on my wrist (not too tight, not too loose.) The lone button on the right side is easy to find and use. It has good travel and feedback. A small hole for the microphone is next to the button. There's no rotating bezel, no buttons, and no ports. The Wear24 charges wirelessly via the included dock. Like most smartwatches, you simply drop the Wear24 on the dock and it starts charging. It couldn't be easier to use. Wear24 Dock   The wearable has an IP67 rating, which means it can handle getting wet. Verizon indicates that it can handle rain and short immersions in water, but it's probably not a good idea to go swimming with the Wear24 on your wrist. Software Setting up the Wear24 requires some time. You'll need a Verizon Android smartphone, the Android Wear application, and some patience. Inexplicably, the Wear24 shipped to me with Android Wear 1.5.x installed, despite the fact that the Wear24's primary promise is being among the first smartwatches to use Android Wear 2.0. I had to download and install Android 2.0. What the what? Android Wear Phone App   With 2.0, the home screen (watch face) behavior of Android Wear now strongly resembles that of Android phones themselves. Swipe down from the top of the watch to access your radio controls, status indicators, screen brightness, and settings. Swipe up from the bottom of the watch to see notifications, which can be dismissed by swiping to the right or opened with a single tap. Swipe left or right on the watch face to explore alternate watch faces. Wear24 User Interface   The biggest change in Android 2.0 is the new app drawer, which is accessed by pressing the hardware button on the right edge. The app drawer is now a semicircular carousel that lines the left side of the screen. Swipe up or down to move through the carousel. You can "star" up to 5 apps, which will be pinned at the top of the carousel for easier access. By default, the most recently used apps appear first. Press the side button to dismiss the app drawer. Pressing the button also acts as a "back" control when using just about any other app. App Drawer   I had no problem using Android Wear 2.0's basic user interface and neither should most anyone else. But I do have a few complaints. The most significant issue facing Android Wear 2.0 and the Wear24 is the Play Store. You can use the Play Store to browse through or search for Android Wear apps, which you can download and install directly on the watch (rather than via the phone). Finding the apps isn't a problem, but downloading and installing them sure is. It takes forever, whether you're downloading over WiFi or LTE. Google Play Music, for example, took nearly 30 minutes to install via WiFi. The app measures just 10MB. Similar-sized apps required just as long. Updating apps directly via the watch is similarly painful. You're much better off using the Android Wear app on your smartphone to download and install watch apps, as it is much quicker and more reliable. I'm not sure if the experience here is dictated by the OS, hardware, or network. Whatever the cause, it's not good. Play Store   Most of the preloaded apps worked as you'd expect on a smartwatch. For example, the weather app lets you gauge the current conditions and view the forecast for the next three days. Rather than allow you to view a full calendar app, Android Wear 2.0 includes an agenda app providing details on your next few appointments. It's just useful enough. I had no trouble with core functions, such as calling, using the stopwatch/timer, and handling notifications from my phone. I do wish there were more preloaded watch faces (there's only one). Finding new watchfaces requires us of the Play Store. As noted earlier, you'll be much better service by downloading new watchfaces in the Android Wear app on your phone. Watchfaces   I am somewhat annoyed by the bloatware. Verizon saw fit to load the watch with VZ Message+ and MyVerizon — both of which cannot be deleted. Smartwatches have extremely limited storage space. Cramming even two unwanted apps aboard is unnecessary. Performance The Wear24's display measures 1.39 inches across and has 400 by 400 pixels. This is an improvement when compared to the first generation of devices, which had similar-sized screens but fewer pixels. The improved pixel density means the Wear24 supports smaller fonts and graphics. This, in turn, allows the screen to accommodate a bit more content. This mostly impacts longer setting and menu screens, as it makes more text available in a single glance. The AMOLED lighting is bright enough so the watch is easy to view indoors and out. It's pretty good at keeping fingerprints at bay. A 450mAh battery is tucked inside the Wear24 and it does an admirable job. Verizon suggests basic standby time lasts up to 60 hours, and that's about right. With minimal use, the watch lasted about 2.5 days in between charges. If you're using it full time throughout the day to make calls and send messages, the battery will give up the ghost by the time you go to bed. In other words, most people will need to charge the Wear24 every night. It would be better if the wearable could make it through two days of real use, but it doesn't. Thankfully the included charger fills up the battery in just over an hour. Docked Watch   The Wear24 has a number of wireless radios buried within, including Bluetooth, LTE, and WiFi. The Bluetooth radio works okay, but I've seen better. I noticed the watch disconnected from my smartphone a handful of times for no reason at all. It has a 30-foot limit, so it will definitely lose the connection if you wander away from your handset. Worse, it won't necessarily automatically reconnect. I had to prod the phone to reconnect to the watch on several occasions. Competing devices were better at reconnecting under similar circumstances. The WiFi radio appears to work. I streamed music using Google Play Music when at home. The sound quality was terrible, but it functioned properly. The LTE radio does its job when you're out in the world sans phone. One of the chief marketing pitches from Verizon is that the Wear24 can make phone calls and send messages without a smartphone. Using the on-board app, you can easily access your contacts and make calls. The Verizon Message+ app, preinstalled handles incoming and outbound messages without problem, but you have to agree to use Message+ on the handset itself. Thankfully you can download and use the messaging app of your choice (I prefer the Google Messages app.) Composing messages on a watch is tricky. Android Wear 2.0 includes an actual on-screen keyboard. It is painful to peck out messages, but it does work. Alternately, you can select from a number of pre-written responses, or dictate via voice. I would love to say dication is the way to go, but the Wear24 had real problems hearing my voice. You can have the Wear24 stand alone as its own distinct device for calls/messages, but it's better if you associate it with your Verizon phone number. This way, when people call your main number it will ring your phone (wherever it is) and the smartwatch on your wrist. You can answer calls on the watch and use the built-in speaker or a separate Bluetooth headset. Call quality was generally pretty bad no matter how I chose to take the call. You won't find a heart rate monitor on the Wear24. You can use Google Fit (or the app of your choice) for tracking walks, runs, hikes, bike rides, weightlifting sessions and more, thanks to the included GPS. Hardcore fitness buffs who want the best workout metrics, including their own heart rate, should probably target different wearables. NFC is available, but the Wear24 doesn't support Android Pay. That's dumb, and we can lay the blame here at Verizon's feet. Qualcomm's Snapdragon Wear 2100 platform powers the Wear24, with 768MB of RAM and 4 GB of storage. I didn't find the performance of the user interface to be all that smooth. I noticed laggy screen response time, slow apps, and delayed actions, like scrolling. It's hard to say if what I saw is related to the processor or buggy software. Google Assistant barely works. Despite manually turning on hotword detection — "OK, Google" — the Wear24 hardly ever responded to my voice-based Assistant requests. When it did, it was often unable to understand my requests, even when they were simple commands for performing Google Searches or texting my contacts. I'm pretty sure this is a microphone problem rather than a software problem, especially when I consider the poor quality of voice calls. Discussion I'm pretty stunned at how crummy a piece of gear the Verizon Wireless Wear24 truly is. The cons outweigh the pros at least three to one. I'll start with the positive stuff. The stainless steel chassis is well made, it's water resistant, and the screen looks good. The Android Wear interface is easier to navigate than previous versions of the platform. The LTE radio does permit calling and messaging from the watch pretty much anywhere Verizon offers service. Battery life is adequate. The silicone strap is cheap, gave me a rash, and is not interchangeable. The Bluetooth radio didn't create strong connections, and WiFi wasn't fast enough. There's no heart rate monitor, and the NFC radio doesn't support Android Pay. The Google Play Store is a nice addition, but downloading and installing apps via WiFi or LTE is a painful endeavor. The Google Assistant — which should be able to help ease the process of performing half the tasks available on the watch — rudely ignores most requests. The generic design does little to stand out or endear itself to potential owners. The Wear24 is exactly the type of shoddy gear retailers like to foist on unwitting consumers at the point of sale. It's a $350 mistake waiting to happen. No one needs this smartwatch, it's too compromised. Stay away. Wait for something better.

Google has released designs for a new 11-story, 1 million-square-foot headquarters in London near King's Cross railway station, complete with a sprawling, landscaped rooftop garden. By Allyssia Alleyne CNN (CNN) -- Google has released designs for a new 11-story, 1 million-square-foot headquarters in London near King's Cross railway station, complete with a sprawling, landscaped rooftop garden. The facilities will include a cafe, gym and pool as well as a rooftop track and ground-floor retail spaces, according to the company's application for permission to build. The campus has been designed by an all-star team that includes Thomas Heatherwick, the British designer behind London's 2012 Olympic cauldron, and Danish architect Bjarke Ingels' BIG firm. The two are also collaborating on Google's Mountain View campus in California. The current designs do not seem characteristic of the two men. Heatherwick was the mastermind behind the recently scrapped garden bridge in London, and last year, Ingels opened what he calls a "courtscraper" -- a structure that combines a communal courtyard with the density of a skyscraper -- in New York. "Our design for the new Google campus at King's Cross is rooted in the local character of the area, taking advantage of the contextually defined building envelope while creating continuously cascading work environments that will connect Googlers across multiple floors," Ingels said in a statement. "By opening up the ground floor and activating the roofscape, the light and airy workspaces are sandwiched between the terraced gardens on the roof -- and market halls, auditoria and shops on the ground." Heatherwick, whose studio is based in King's Cross, added: "We have treated this new building for Google like a piece of infrastructure too, made from a family of interchangeable elements which ensure that the building and its workspace will stay flexible for years to come." The company currently has a smaller headquarters in the area, along with another nearby building. Google had submitted designs for a new headquarters in 2013, but they were later scrapped. If the new application is approved by Camden Council, construction will start next year. TM & © 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

自由電子報 | 影音娛樂 | 好康報報 | 自由部落 ‧Business Home Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorials Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Home / Business Fri, Jun 02, 2017 - Page 11　 Print Mail Facebook Twitter plurk funp Stores offer Android Pay MORE OPTIONS:Google’s mobile payment platform, for now only available to CTBC Bank and First Commercial Bank customers, is the third to debut in Taiwan this year Staff writer, with CNA A woman yesterday uses Android Pay to pay for groceries at a Jason’s Market Place in Taipei. Photo: CNA Android Pay, a mobile digital wallet platform developed by Google, was launched nationwide yesterday, with thousands of stores joining the new payment service. Users of smartphones or tablets equipped with near-field communication and Android Kitkat 4.4 or more advanced operating systems are to have access to the new service, Google Taiwan said. Android Pay has been rolled out in 13 nations since September 2015, including the US, UK, Canada, Hong Kong and Singapore. Taiwan is the fourth market in Asia to have the service, Google Taiwan managing director Chien Lee-feng (簡立峰) said. Holders of Visa and MasterCard credit cards issued by CTBC Bank (中國信託銀行) and First Commercial Bank (第一銀行) can make use of the service, Google Taiwan said. As long as credit card holders from the two participating banks install the Android Pay app and add their cards, they will be able to make tap-to-pay purchases in participating stores online and offline, it said. Android Pay also incorporates Google Maps services to remind consumers of coupons, membership cards and discounts when they visit stores, it added. HappyGo, the largest point-collecting platform in the nation, is also to allow people to add their cards to Android Pay, Google Taiwan said, adding that purchases at certain shops would contribute points that can be used for discounts on future purchases. Stores in Taiwan that accept Android Pay include Carrefour, A-Mart (愛買), RT-Mart (大潤發), Pxmart (全聯), Taipei 101, Pacific Sogo Department Store (太平洋崇光百貨), Starbucks and Watsons, the company said. Taiwan is an important market for Android Pay because it has a fast-growing e-commerce market and great potential for mobile payment growth, Chien said. According to Google Taiwan, 62 percent of consumers in Taiwan have made purchases over the Internet, posting about US$38 billion in aggregate transaction value to date. Smartphones account for 82 percent of the nation’s cellphone market and it is the fifth-largest market for Android Play: further evidence of its growth potential, Chien said. The introduction of Android Pay is expected to be welcomed by Taiwanese who are keen to have alternative payment methods, he said, adding that it would likely accelerate the pace of mobile payment adoption. Android Pay is the third major foreign mobile payment platform available in Taiwan, following Apple Pay, which started in late March, and Samsung Pay, which began early last month.

Photograph: HayesDavidson Architecture Sober look of Google's 'landscraper' shows tech firm is trying to grow up Heatherwick-designed London building eschews campus architectural trends and instead sports polite corporate costume Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close Oliver Wainwright @ollywainwright Thursday 1 June 2017 12.43 EDT Last modified on Thursday 1 June 2017 17.00 EDT Plans for Google’s new London headquarters have been shrouded in secrecy and awaited with bated breath since the internet giant ditched its original architects in 2015 for being “too boring”. But the proposals for the £1bn project finally unveiled this week have considerably cranked down the wow factor. Stretching for over 300 metres along the side of the railway tracks of King’s Cross, the 1 million sq ft (92,000 m2) “landscraper” office building is a surprisingly sober design from the studios of Thomas Heatherwick and Danish architect Bjarke Ingels, the starry duo who are also working together on Google’s Californian headquarters in Mountain View. Having built international reputations for projects that often defy the logic of both gravity and common sense, the pair were an obvious choice for a tech company that prides itself on reinventing everything it turns its hand to. But, while in California they are conjuring a sci-fi vision of freeform pavilions arranged beneath a big undulating metal tent , their London project sports the polite generic costume of any other corporate office block. Eschewing the tech campus trend for increasingly wacky architecture, it appears Google may be trying to grow up. The earlier scheme, designed by AHMM in 2013, featured an elaborate climbing wall and bike ramp running the full height of the building, so that Googlers could climb or cycle to their desks. Such novelties have now been banished and replaced with a simple wooden staircase that runs the length of the building, conceived as an “internal promenade” where employees can meet and meander. The plan for jaunty cladding painted in Google’s brand colours has also been swapped for a sleek, muted dressing of timber fins and curving bronzed panels, a palette that has more the whiff of a luxury apartment scheme or a swanky hotel complex. That’s not surprising when you see what’s inside. A 25-metre swimming pool, massage rooms, basketball court and nap pods await the 7,000 Google employees who could eventually be housed here, brought together from offices currently spread across King’s Cross, Covent Garden and Victoria. Facebook Twitter Pinterest A render of Google’s new London headquarters in King’s Cross. Photograph: HayesDavidson Recycling elements from his aborted garden bridge plans, Heatherwick proposes crowning the building with a rolling garden, where outdoor “rooms” will be divided by planting and groups of long benches, and stools will “support collaboration” alfresco, while a 200-metre “trim trail” loops around this rooftop meadow, encouraging the Google culture of walking meetings. Inside, the open-plan office floors are broken up with “pause areas”, trees and planted walls designed to protrude out on to the facade in places, a green garnish to emphasise the company’s environmental credentials. The landscaping elements are all being designed by Gillespies, the firm behind the notorious Walkie Talkie “sky garden” in London, which didn’t quite live up to the promise of a rooftop jungle. Heatherwick, who has lived and worked in King’s Cross for more than 15 years and designed the Coal Drops Yard shopping arcade under construction nearby, says the project is a response to the richly layered context of “massive railway stations, roads, canals and other infrastructure”. “Influenced by these surroundings, we have treated this new building for Google like a piece of infrastructure too,” he says, “made from a family of interchangeable elements which ensure that the building and its workspace will stay flexible for years to come.” Three primary concrete floor decks provide the support for lighter timber floors hung between them, arranged to provide a series of single-, double- and triple-height workspaces with a “warehouse” quality. Ingels says the “continuously cascading work environments” will connect Googlers across multiple floors, “sandwiched between the terraced gardens on the roof and market halls, auditoria and shops on the ground”. Rising from seven to 11 storeys, the gargantuan landscraper (imagine the Shard lying down) will sit atop a row of shops and restaurants, providing the much needed retail revenue to help pay for it all. It’s a tricky site – long, thin and sitting on top of a stepped concrete box that covers a sloping access ramp for the railway – and the designers have done a decent, if unremarkable, job of reconciling the constraints. But a look at the planning application reveals that the executive architect of the project is neither Heatherwick Studio nor Ingels’ practice BIG, but BDP – a corporate giant that has been several times shortlisted for the Carbuncle Cup for the country’s ugliest building. From the details provided in the drawings, there is little reason to believe the finished product will rise much beyond their usual standards, nor much evidence of how Heatherwick and Ingels’ role extends further than being the signature stylists to lubricate the project through the system.

This past week I needed to be able to read some data from a Google Sheet and then update a column for each row after processing it. This sort of thing should be simple, Google is built on APIs and has client SDKs for just about every language. I’ve also integrated with several Google Admin APIs previously so I expected this to be a breeze. I was wrong. I started out by reading the Quickstart for Sheets API with the PHP Client, but almost immediately I could tell it was not written for my use case. [...] My use case is to use a backend process to function as a service account and batch process data. So the whole API credentials process was wrong for me. He tried a few different approaches and finally, after some guessing, discovered how to share a sheet with the email address for the application. He then includes the steps to follow to get this same setup configured for your application and the code (using the Google_Client) to read and write to the sheet. tagged: read write google sheets tutorial client sharing Link: http://www.phillipshipley.com/2017/05/read-and-write-google-sheets-from-php/ Trending Topics: tutorial laravel package introduction podcast framework application series zendexpressive example All content copyright, PHPDeveloper.org :: info@phpdeveloper.org

Lyons, Ehsun Forghany and Karon N. Fowler Morgan Lewis The Federal Circuit recently held that the Patent Trial and Appeal Board is not constrained by parties' proposed constructions and may, in fact, adopt an alternative construction that the Board raises for the first time at oral argument, so long as both sides have adequate notice and an opportunity to respond. On May 8, the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed the Patent Trial and Appeal Board's (Board's) decision to invalidate certain claims challenged in an inter partes review (IPR) proceeding based on an alternative construction previewed by the Board for the first time at oral argument and that no party had previously argued for or expected. As long as both parties offer constructions for that claim term prior to argument and are given an opportunity to respond during the argument, the court held that the Board may adopt that alternative construction in its final written decision without violating a party's due process rights. The Decision In Intellectual Ventures II LLC v. Ericsson Inc. et al., the Board granted three petitions for IPR filed by Ericsson and Google challenging different claims from two different Intellectual Ventures II (IV) patents, both of which claimed methods for selecting an appropriate bandwidth in a multibandwidth communication system.[1] In their briefing, the parties offered competing constructions of a key term recited in both patents: "an indication of an operating bandwidth." IV advocated for one construction, Google contended that the plain and ordinary meaning should control, and Ericsson argued that IV's definition was too narrow and no construction was needed.[2] This debate carried over into the oral argument for each petition�an exchange later characterized by the Board as a "vigorous dispute over the proper construction." [3] During the oral argument, however, the Board sua sponte asked the parties whether it would be "sufficient for us to say that enough information is conveyed from the transmitter to the receiver so that the receiver can configure itself to receive that which is transmitted"�i.e., an alternative construction of the term that neither party had proposed and that was notably broader than IV's proposed construction.[4] Google's counsel responded affirmatively. And although IV's counsel disputed the Board's proposed construction, it too conceded that "there's no special requirement for the form of an indication of operating bandwidth." In its final written decision, the Board relied solely on its alternative construction to find all challenged claims of the IV patents invalid over the cited references.[5] IV appealed on several grounds, including that the Board had denied it procedural due process by construing a claim term to mean something no party had proposed or expected.[6] The Federal Circuit disagreed. The court explained that "[d]ue process requires notice and an opportunity to be heard by an impartial decision-maker."[7] In other words, due process requires that the Board "give the parties an opportunity to submit facts and arguments for consideration," so that each party may "present oral and document evidence in support of its case, as well as rebuttal evidence."[8] The court also reiterated that "the Board may not change theories midstream without giving the parties reasonable notice of its change."[9] Turning to the facts at hand, the Federal Circuit found "no due process violation" given "the continuous focus on 'an indication of an operating bandwidth' before and during oral arguments and [IV's] opportunity to seek a sur-reply or rehearing."[10] As long as the Board provides parties with the necessary notice and opportunity to be heard, the court held that "the Board is not constrained by the parties' proposed constructions and is free to adopt its own construction, as it did here."[11] However, the Federal Circuit issued a word of caution: "To be clear, after the Board adopts a construction, it may not change theories without giving the parties an opportunity to respond."[12] According to the court, however, "[n]o such change occurred here" because "the Board questioned counsel about [the disputed term] at oral argument, asked for a reaction to a hypothetical construction, and issued its construction in its Final Written Decision."[13] Future Implications The Intellectual Ventures decision falls in line with two recent Federal Circuit decisions�In re Magnum Oil International Ltd.[14] and SAS Institute, Inc. v. ComplementSoft, LLC[15]�that addressed similar due process concerns in the context of post-grant proceedings. � In Magnum Oil, the Federal Circuit reversed the Board's decision to "adopt[] arguments on behalf of petitioners that could have been, but were not, raised by the petitioner during an IPR."[16] Because the petitioner bears the burden of proving unpatentability, the court held that "the Board must base its decision on arguments that were advanced by a party, and to which the opposing party was given a chance to respond."[17] In other words, "the Board supplied completely new arguments that the petitioner never raised."[18] This differs from Intellectual Ventures, "where the Board questioned counsel extensively over the construction of [the disputed term] after receiving briefs that contested both whether and how the Board needed to construe the term."[19] Along the same lines, the Federal Circuit in SAS reversed the Board's decision to "adopt[] a construction in its final written decision" after "chang[ing] theories in midstream."[20] Unlike SAS, however, "where the Board construed a claim term one way in its Institution Decision and, unexpectedly, a different way in its Final Written Decision," the Board in Intellectual Ventures posed the hypothetical construction to both parties during oral argument before adopting the construction in its final written decision.[21] At bottom, the Intellectual Ventures decision makes clear that the Board may adopt a construction not advanced by any party so long as it provides the parties with notice and an opportunity to respond, even if that construction is raised for the first time at oral argument. Accordingly, parties to a post-grant proceeding should be prepared to substantively address any alternative construction previewed by the Board during oral argument, especially where both sides argued competing constructions prior to argument. But even where the Board adopts a construction for a claim term that neither side briefed, or adopts a construction without affording both sides a meaningful opportunity to respond, parties should still consider seeking a sur-reply or rehearing in order to preserve their due process claim for appeal.

We are only able to provide the material on the Mondaq (and its affiliate sites) site free to site visitors because we can pass on information about the pages that users are viewing and the personal information users provide to us (e.g. email addresses) to reputable contributing firms such as law firms who author those pages.

Google Store officially launches in Puerto Rico, Pixel and other products available for purchase Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/31 4:35pm PDTMay 31, 2017 22 Plus 1 on G+ 100 Share on Facebook 55 Share on Twitter Total Shares177 Google News Puerto Rico, despite being a territory of the United States, is often treated as a separate country by businesses. Puerto Rican residents could order from the US Google Store, but now Google has created a seperate Store just for the island itself. The Google Store country picker, which lists all of the countries with their own Store, has been updated to include Puerto Rico. In addition, the support document listing product availability by country has been updated with mentions of the island. Currently, only the Google Pixel, Daydream View, Samsung Chromebook Plus, and various accessories are available for purchase. Still, at least Puerto Rico residents can now buy an unlocked Pixel straight from Google. You can view the island's Google Store at the source link below.

I ordered my Nexus 4 and a Pixel C from google store. And I obviously live in Puerto Rico. Frisi Just put United States in the billing address and you're good to go. ;) Christian Camacho My account always had access to Google Devices and I live in PR. I've been ordering from the Google Store since the Nexus 4. I'm confused. Frisi This is for those who put Puerto Rico as country instead of United States. I always put my address to United States as country, since we're part of the US. If I put Puerto Rico it even locks me out of the Play Store (except for apps and games). Frisi It has always worked. Since we're part of the United States, we could put US as country and have access to Google's entire hardware catalogue. I have ordered the Pixel, Nexus 5X, Chromecast, Chromebooks, cases, etc. Same applies with Google Play itself. If you put US as country, Movies, Music, and Books works. If you put just Puerto Rico as country then you're locked out from the aforementioned services. Artem Russakovskii That is mind-bogglingly dumb, especially since https://support.google.com/store/answer/2462844 now provides specific exclusions for Puerto Rico for most products. Frisi I don't even know. I know I have been redirected to the Puerto Rico section for weeks now. Possibly a month or so. All I do is change back to the US and order normally. I haven't had any issues at all. Products work here fine (Pixel, Assistant, Home, Chromecast) even with local services. Josue Rivera Well according to that page chromecast is not available in PR, yet I own one that I purchased through Google on the last black friday sale they had with HBO streaming service. Same deal as Frisi said I use the US store and in address use US (which isn't wrong as we are a territory that depends on USPS anyways) lol. So now we have "official" store with half the products locked out... Artem Russakovskii ¯_(ツ)_/¯ MJ Great, now that Puerto Rico has access to the Play store next thing you know they will want to be US citizens. Frisi We *are* US citizens... MJ Shhhhh... Most people in the US don't know that. Tom Westrick They already are US citizens MJ I guess should have ended my comment with /joke.

According to Google’s director for emerging platforms Spencer Spinell, the desktop implementation of Android Pay will be designed to complement its current offering of mobile payment service. However, Spinell stated that they are currently focusing on mobile platforms, which is not surprising given that the infrastructure and standards for desktop implementation of payment services are yet to be finalized. There is a clear benefit in making Android Pay available to desktops since it will result in a less complicated user experience as consumers can use the same service everywhere. At this point, however, Google is already working with partners to develop standards that will allow for a secure desktop implementation of its payment service. According to Spinell, Google is currently working in collaboration with WC3, the consortium responsible for developing desktop and web payment standards. By working with WC3, the interoperability of payment solutions will be guaranteed. Google itself is developing an open standard for desktop payment, which it calls the Payment Request API. The open nature of the standard allows the said API to be implemented not only in Google Chrome but practically across all the different browsers used around the globe. It will also seamlessly support as many payment methods as possible. Google describes the said API as a “process layer” which aims to allow the browser to act as an intermediary between the user, merchants, and payment services. By adopting the API, Google hopes that the payment communication flow in desktops will be standardized, reducing or even eliminating the need for lengthy checkout forms before a purchase. While it is working to develop a desktop implementation of its payment method, Google is still working hard to ensure compatibility of its mobile payment service with more banks and financial institutions in numerous markets around the world. J ust recently, Google launched its payment service in Canada and Russia. The search giant is also working to improve the security and user experience of Android Pay. Recently, a teardown of the Android Pay app shows that the payment service may support facial recognition soon, providing users with more options to secure their financial transactions.

The release of the Samsung Chromebook Pro was going to be the opening salvo in 2017's battle of the cheap computers. It went on sale on May 28th, priced at $549.99. It's a handsome and thin touchscreen laptop that looks like it costs twice as much as it does. Because it also comes with a stylus and performs at speeds you don't usually get on Chrome OS, it should have been an inexpensive flagship that can prove that Chromebooks aren't just for students and couches, but could be your main computer. The operative word there is "should." Because after a grand unveiling at CES, reality hit: the hardware wasn't finished in time, and the software still isn't finished. Even though it's now on sale and shipping to customers, the software has a memory bug that crashes the computer if you push it too hard. Until Google fixes it, you should hold off on buying this laptop. I’m holding off on reviewing it, too. I found that if I open more than a dozen or so tabs or web apps, the Chromebook Pro can become unstable — the whole device will freeze or even restart. The problem is intermittent and seems worse if you happen to open an Android app or had opened and closed one since you last rebooted. Proper support for Android apps is still months away Although Android apps are still in beta, they’re available for regular users out of the box. In fact, one of the core features of the Chromebook Pro is annotating images in the Android version of Google Keep. That means you can’t use the key differentiating feature of the Chromebook Pro without causing crashes. To be clear, the bug rears its head even if you never open an Android app — it just seems to be worse when you do. Until Google solves these problems, you can only use a fraction of the Chromebook Pro's capabilities without risking a freeze-up. Google says it’s working on the software fix. What I should have been doing this week is judging this laptop by a new standard: standing toe-to-toe against Windows 10 S and the iPad as a complete vision for the next generation of simplified, secure, yet nevertheless powerful computing. Instead of doing that, I’m doing this: telling you that the Chromebook Pro was delayed, that the main thing we were hoping it would do (Android apps) is still months away from being any good, and the people who ordered it on day one are going to experience a critical bug that breaks their experience until Google issues a patch. Earlier this month, I wrote that Google prefers slow and steady iteration to flashy, change-the-world product releases. That slow and steady approach is admirable in its way and may ultimately win the race for Chrome OS. But if you're going to take a measured approach to releasing products, you absolutely shouldn't be tripping over your own feet as you do it. We’ll update this article and post a review of the Chromebook Pro when Google issues the patch.

The report, titled ‘Online Education in India: 2021, was based on market research conducted by KPMG and combined with insights from Google search. The research covered more than 3,600 respondents from across 27 geographies, including metro and non-metros to understand the growth of consumer paid online education market in India by 2021. The respondents were in the age group of 16-45 years. According to the report,the paid user base would grow six times (6x) from 1.6 million users in 2016 to 9.6 million users in 2021. At a time when the IT services industry was talking about re-skilling, the study said re-skilling and online certification was the largest category in the online education space. In 2016, it was valued at $93 million and expected to grow at a CAGR of 38% to reach 463 million by 2021. “The online education segment is set to become a multi-billion dollar opportunity in India. There are many factors driving this growth, including the perceived convenience, increased reach and personalisation offered by online channels,” said Nitin Bawankule, industry director, Google India, in a statement. The report said over the last two years, there had been a 2x growth in online searches for education and a 3x growth in searches from a mobile device. Also, 44% of education searches were now coming from beyond the top 6 metros and there had been a 4x growth in education content consumption on YouTube in the last one year. As per the report, the primary and secondary education category had the largest addressable audience with students base of about 260 million when compared with the other categories. Owing to this, the primary and secondary supplementary education segment was the second largest category in 2016 and would grow at a CAGR of 60% to reach $773 million, making it the largest category in 2021. Test preparation, which is a small segment as of now, would likely to grow at CAGR of 64% to become a $515 million category in 2021.

According to security researchers and mobile experts at Check Point, an auto-clicking malware dubbed they now call “Judy” may already be the biggest malware campaign found on Google Play. Based on the team’s report posted on May 25, the malware which was discovered to be embedded in 41 Android apps developed by Korean company Kiniwini already has reached millions of Android users in the world. According to them, the malicious apps containing the Judy malware already has a staggering download count between 4.5 million and 18.5 million. According to the report, the firm behind the malware was registered in the Platy Store as ENISTUDIO Corp., the developer for popular cooking games including Chef Judy: Picnic Lunch Maker. Aside from that, the team unearthed more apps on Google Play that may contain the codes for the ad-clicking software that were not developed by the initial perpetrators. The connection between the 41 apps with malware codes in them as well as the ones from other developers remain a mystery. However, Check Point experts have a theory about how they gained access to the malware. “The connection between the two campaigns remains unclear, and it is possible that one borrowed code from the other, knowingly or unknowingly.” [Image by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images] The team’s research on revealed that the malware acts by infecting a device with a click-generating software that “clicks” on advertisements without the knowledge of the user. This, in turn, generate more revenue for the people behind the Judy malware. From what the team’s research discovered, the oldest of the other Google Play apps with the malicious software was last updated in April 2016 which means that the code has been hidden for quite a while in the Android application store. Fortunately, Google immediately took action after the security research firm submitted their report unveiling the malware and has since removed all apps that may contain its code. Still, security provided to Android users by the Google Bouncer, Play Store’s protection system, can only do as much considering that the culprits behind the malware found a way to pass the screening without getting detected by not adding the malicious part of the code to the software immediately. Speaking to BBC, Open University Networking Senior Lecturer Andrew Smith revealed that after being downloaded, the Judy malware quietly runs a registration of the user’s device to a remote server that responds with the malicious ad-click part of the code. [Image by DaLiu/Thinkstock] While it may sound clever to people who are not well-versed with technical stuff, this delivery “has become commonplace,” according to Smith. “There are many tools available, and the advantage is that the malware distributor can change them remotely, which makes it difficult for anti-malware software to keep up.” The general rule in preventing online junk like the Judy malware to infect one’s devices is to vigilant. Tech Times provided specific tips to prevent similar malicious software from entering your devices. Before downloading any app, make sure to read reviews “for potential red flags” even with ones that are from reputable developers. Also, make sure that your device’s operating system is updated as most OS updates contain security patches for recently discovered threats. Heavy mobile users and Internet enthusiasts are also advised to make use to VPN especially when connected to a public network and make sure that an antivirus software has been installed. When opening up your device to Wi-Fi’s and other unknown networks, make sure to add levels of security codes such as passwords and PIN codes that are strong by making it specific and more personal.

[Final Answer] 233 SHARES 188 READS Ron Dod Ron Dod 188 READS The impact of social media on SEO has, and probably always will be, one of the most talked about topics in the search industry. Specifically, whether social media really helps your SEO efforts. So does it? Short answer: yes. For the longer answer, however, you really should read the rest of this post. Social media doesn’t help SEO in the way many people think it does. Let’s answer this question by digging into some data, evidence from Google employees, and personal insights. Social Media ≠ Ranking Factor First off, in reality, it’s highly unlikely we’ll ever know exactly what’s in Google’s algorithm unless someone works at Google, doesn’t sign an NDA (good luck!), and decides to share that information with us. No shocker here — that isn’t likely to happen. So we’re left to infer based on what Google employees have said and what we have in case studies/data. Google has repeatedly told us that social signals aren’t a direct ranking factor. Let’s start with What Social Signals Do Google & Bing Really Count? by Search Engine Land’s Danny Sullivan. In this article, Google confirmed that links shared on Facebook and Twitter are used as a ranking signal. After this article was published, Matt Cutts, the former head of Google’s webspam team, confirmed that Google used links from Facebook and Twitter as ranking signal. Here’s that video: Fast forward to 2014. Cutts produced another video tackling this question. This time he said that Google treats Facebook and Twitter pages like any other web page for search, but not as a ranking factor. In 2016, Gary Illyes, a Google Webmaster Trends Analyst, was asked if Google takes social into account for SEO. He then retweeted Cutts’ video and said: “the short version is, no, we don’t.” Since Google’s algorithm is so secretly guarded, we have to take these comments at their official word — that social media isn’t a direct ranking factor. But just because Google said that social isn’t a ranking factor doesn’t mean that it doesn’t impact rankings. According to Searchmetrics’ 2016 Rebooting Ranking Factors White Paper: “The correlation between social signals and ranking position is extremely high, and the number of social signals per landing page has remained constant when compared to with the values from last year’s whitepaper. … The top-ranked websites in Google’s rankings displays vastly more social signals than all other pages…. This is primarily due to the overlap between brand websites performing strongly in social networks and being allocated top positions by Google.” I believe the answer to this lies in the second word in that quote — correlation. Cutts hints at the same thing when he says, “It’s correlation, not causation.” We know links are one of the top Google ranking factors. Google has said that social media shares don’t count as individual links. But there most likely is correlation here. If you create good content, it will most likely be popular on social media, and people are probably going to like it and link it to — which does boost your rankings. So is it a surprise that sites with high ranking positions also have high numbers of social signals? It shouldn’t. It makes sense, but that doesn’t mean it is a direct ranking factor. How Social Media Helps SEO Although social media isn’t a direct Google ranking factor, here are four ways social media actually does help your SEO efforts. 1. Potential for Links The more shares on social media you have, the more opportunities people have to see your content and link to it. In this case study, a company achieved over 130,000 Facebook shares to a web page and shot up the rankings for keyword phrases that were competitive. It still ranks #1 (as of this writing) and is a really good example of a good content creation and promotion strategy. Back in 2014, we assumed Facebook shares were a good ranking signal and, therefore, we preached Facebook shares would help rankings. What we were unable to see was that it wasn’t about Facebook shares at all. It was about links that can come from Facebook shares. Here’s an example: The author found the article on Facebook and then decided to link back to it. This shows that having popular content on social media helps to attract potential links. It doesn’t matter whether it’s Twitter, Pinterest, or Facebook. If you make high-quality content that gains traction on social media, you’re more likely to get links from other websites. 2. Build an Audience You can have the best product or service out there, but if people don’t know about it, you can give it up. “Build it and they will come” doesn’t cut it in today’s competitive marketplace. You have to be proactive and reach people where they are. And where are the majority of people? Social media. In fact, Facebook has nearly 2 billion users. With the number of people on social media, its worldwide reach, and its ease of sharing, social media is a great way to build your web presence and quickly build an audience. If you want to be found among the millions of sites on the web (and the 571 new websites being created each minute), you’re going to have to up your social game. We also know that click-through rates can impact search engine rankings. Social media marketing helps build brand awareness and an audience, which increases the likelihood that people will click on your brand’s content in Google’s search results. Here’s a good example, a search for [three most important google ranking factors]: Since I know that Search Engine Journal is one of the most trusted voices in search engine marketing, I’m more likely to click on their organic listings than any of the others. Think about it from your own experience — if you were to Google “men’s running shoes”, wouldn’t you be more likely to click on Nike, as opposed to randomshoecompany.com? You might not want to admit it, but yes, consumers are more likely to turn to companies they know and trust. The bigger your brand is and the more consumers trust you, the more likely you are to receive a larger share of clicks in Google. Social media can be a great and efficient way to help you build your brand and get in front of people who wouldn’t have otherwise found you. Once you start getting more of the share of clicks in Google from your expanded audience, the higher you will start to rank. 3. Branded Searches When consumers Google your brand name plus a keyword phrase, it can help you rank for similar keyword phrases. An example of this would be if you have a horde of consumers searching “[Your Brand Name] Jeans” and they interact positively with your content, Google would think that since your web page ranks well for “[Your Brand Name] Jeans”, it would also be a good result for “Jeans” and place you higher for the keyword phrase “Jeans”. In a quick analysis of a fashion website we did earlier this year, the site, FashionNova, rose from nothing to 88,000 keywords (in SEMrush) over the course of a year. We discovered that the only positive SEO ranking factors it had over everyone else were that its bounce rate was much lower than other sites, according to Alexa, and they had 6.3 million Instagram followers. Instagram doesn’t have the best linking procedure, so what happened was hundreds of thousands of consumers each month were searching Google for things like “Fashion Nova Jeans” and other related keyword phrases. This enabled Google to understand more of what consumers wanted when they searched particular phrases. If consumers interacted positively with the Fashionnova.com web page — which ranks for “Fashion Nova Jeans” — then, over the course of 100,000 search queries a month for the keyword phrase “Fashion Nova Jeans”, you might imagine Google would eventually have thought perhaps that particular web page would be good for the keyword phrase “Jeans” as well. 4. Helps Promotion Although this article has focused mostly on Facebook and Twitter, we can’t forget YouTube. YouTube is actually the second most-searched search engine. However, most of the YouTube search queries have low commercial-intent, whereas Google brings in all the converting customers. But you can still use YouTube to positively influence your SEO performance. You can create videos to promote your content or brand, which can lead to links, and your videos can potentially rank organically in the SERPs. A good example is a company which blends random items and made a website out of their YouTube videos once they realized YouTube videos hosted on YouTube provide no real SEO value. You can use this example, and other social media platforms, to promote your content to your audience and be able to acquire high-quality backlinks. There are a few dependencies though: Your audience must be on social media. Your audience must care about your content. This is why B2B is a pretty hard sell when doing social media marketing in order to help SEO. Engagement is challenging for most B2B companies. Generally, people using social media aren’t thinking about work. They’re thinking about their interests and hobbies. So if you can take a different approach (perhaps creating humorous content or something outside of your service offering), you just might get better engagement. Conclusion Will Google ever include more social media signals in its ranking algorithm? Maybe, maybe not. Regardless of what the future holds, it’s clear that social media can, in fact, help your SEO efforts. Social media offers many long-term benefits. Even if social media isn’t a direct Google ranking factor, it is one of the best ways to promote content and be found online. Which is, ultimately, what SEO is all about.

Is Apple Readying Speaker to Rival Google, Amazon? Jun 1, 2017 Bloomberg | IoT and the Digitization of Manufacturing EMAIL Tweet Comments 0 Apple has started manufacturing a long-in-the-works Siri-controlled smart speaker, and could debut it as soon as its annual developer conference this month. The new Apple headquarters is operational, but construction likely won’t be finished until near the end of this year. Justin Sullivan, Getty Images Advertisement Apple Inc. is already in your pocket, on your desk and underneath your television. Soon, a device embossed with “Designed by Apple in California” could be on your nightstand or kitchen counter. Apple has started manufacturing a long-in-the-works Siri-controlled smart speaker, according to people familiar with the matter. Apple could debut the speaker as soon as its annual developer conference this month, but the device will not be ready to ship until later in the year, the people said.  The device will differ from Amazon.com Inc.’s Echo and Alphabet Inc.’s Google Home speakers by offering virtual surround sound technology and deep integration with Apple’s product lineup, said the people, who requested anonymity to discuss products that aren’t yet public. Introducing a speaker would serve two main purposes: providing a hub to automate appliances and lights via Apple’s HomeKit system, and establishing a bulwark inside the home to lock customers more tightly into Apple’s network of services. That would help combat the competitive threat from Google’s and Amazon’s connected speakers: the Home and Echo mostly don’t support services from Apple. Without compatible hardware, users may be more likely to opt for the Echo or Home, and therefore use streaming music offerings such as Spotify, Amazon Prime Music or Google Play rather than Apple Music. Popular Now How to Set Up a Lean Factory That Works, Part 1 Top 25 Supply Chains of 2016 Moving Quality Beyond the Factory Floor with Holistic Improvement “This will be a platform for developing Apple’s services,” said Gene Munster, a co-founder of Loup Ventures and former Apple analyst. Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller declined to comment. CEO Tim Cook has emphasized Apple’s services businesses over the past 18 months as iPhone sales slowed. He expects service revenue to double by 2020 from last year’s $24 billion. A speaker may help keep customers loyal to service products such as Apple Music, a subscription music streaming offering that costs $10 per month. The speaker would likely be tucked into Apple’s “Other Products” category, which currently includes devices like the Apple Watch, Apple TV and AirPods. That set of products generated $11 billion in sales last year. Inventec Corp., the Taipei manufacturer that already makes the AirPod wireless headphones, will add the speaker to its Apple repertoire, the people said. Apple employees have been secretly testing the device in their homes for several months, they said. The Siri speaker reached an advanced prototype stage late last year, Bloomberg News reported at the time. An Inventec representative didn’t respond to a request for comment outside normal business hours in Taiwan. This year’s developers conference will be the first since 2013 to introduce new hardware. Apple could announce updated iPad tablets at the conference, one of the people said. Apple last updated the 9.7-inch iPad Pro in March 2016 and hasn’t refreshed the larger 12.9-inch model since its November 2015 debut. Planned Mac updates will include refreshed versions of the MacBook and MacBook Pro with faster Intel Corp. processors, Bloomberg News reported earlier this month. Apple hopes that more advanced acoustics technology will give the speaker an edge over competitors, according to people with knowledge of the product’s development. Along with generating virtual surround sound, the speakers being tested are louder and reproduce sound more crisply than rival offerings, the people said. Apple has also considered including sensors that measure a room’s acoustics and automatically adjust audio levels during use, one of the people said. Love tech? Keep up with the manufacturing technology world with the M&T Newsletter, in your inbox every Friday morning Apple will also likely let third-party services build products for the speaker. Last year, Apple opened up Siri on the iPhone to the likes of Uber Technologies Inc. and Facebook Inc., allowing a user to order a ride or send a WhatsApp message with a voice command. The device will be a hub for Apple’s HomeKit home automation system, letting users control devices such as lights, door locks and window blinds. At present, an Apple TV or iPad is required to control that equipment from outside the home or automatically. The Echo and Google Home both support third-party services and smart home appliances. Ahead of Apple’s launch, the competition has upgraded their speakers with support for making voice calls, while Amazon’s gained a touchscreen. Apple’s speaker won’t include such a screen, according to people who have seen the product. An Apple-designed speaker with high-end sound quality that fits perfectly into the Apple ecosystem is a familiar pitch. In 2006, Apple unveiled the iPod Hi-Fi, a battery powered speaker designed to cast a shadow over the thriving iPod third-party accessory market. With its bulky size and high price point, the Hi-Fi flopped and was discontinued within 18 months of launching. With Siri and a clear hole in its ecosystem, Apple is banking that its second try at a speaker product will do better.

These are an automated extension type that showcases advertisers with high ratings. Google will collect seller ratings from reputable sources that aggregate business reviews. This AdWords ad extension shows below the ad and looks like this: Many advertisers who are new ask why they don't see these seller ratings for their sites. Well, it normally takes at least 12 months of data aggregation for Google to start showing these ratings. Often it also requires at least 150 unique seller reviews over the past 12 months. If you do not have 150 reviews in the past month, you might lose those ratings. The help docs read: For Google Shopping star ratings to appear, typically your business needs at least 150 unique seller reviews, each from the past 12 months. However, we may show ratings for merchants with fewer than 150 reviews if we have sufficient data from other sources to determine an accurate rating. Google was asked this on Twitter: @DennisGriemink Hi Dennis, Google looks at the last 12 months worth of data from various sources when generating seller ratings.

It happens way too often where someone will go to Google and then search for Google to bring up Google. Yes, I know it sounds crazy but I've seen at least two clients do that right in front of my eyes over the years and who knows how many people do it at their desk? In any event, one SEO asked Google's Gary Illyes if he ever got an email from an SEO offering them SEO services specifically aimed at helping Google rank well in Google for [google]. Gary from Google said yes, he has received email offers for such a service. Here is the tweet: @i_praveensharma Yes— Gary Illyes ᕕ( ᐛ )ᕗ (@methode) April 9, 2017 Can you imagine if Google ranked Bing for the term [google]? Yea, one of you are going to point out the search results for [search engine on Google - it has been that way for a while. Anyway, if you want to help Google rank well for that, reach out to Gary. :) As you can see, the keyword density around this post for the term google is way high and I am trying to outrank Google for google on this post. This way, I can sell them a link on this page for them to try to rank #1 for google again in Google. :-P Forum discussion at Twitter.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: 3 Top Information Technology Stocks to Buy in 2017 Here are three ways to profit in the information technology sector this year. Anders Bylund (TMFZahrim) Jun 1, 2017 at 10:26AM Information technology has been a hot topic for decades. The industry has helped many investors build successful retirement portfolios, and will create lots of wealth in the future, too. That being said, it's also a risky sector where investors can walk into a value trap at every turn. It's important to separate the dry chaff from the golden wheat in this market, metaphorically speaking. I'm here to point you in the right direction, with three top information technology stocks offering more rewards than risk right now. Read on to see how Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE), Akamai Technologies (NASDAQ:AKAM), and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) can live up to that promise, each in its own particular way. Image source: Alphabet. A fleet-footed giant Today, you know Alphabet as the parent company of internet search and advertising giant Google. Under that consumer-friendly brand, the company also runs many services aimed directly at corporate customers. Online advertising is the prime example of this, followed by cloud-computing services and advanced machine learning tools. The Google umbrella covers 99% of Alphabet's revenue today, but that's going to change in the long run. Without the "Other Bets" division, there would be no need to wrap the successful Google business in the Alphabet structure. That segment is working on new ideas in fields as diverse as medical research, self-driving cars, and high-speed connectivity services. Come back in 10 years, and chances are that the Alphabet you see will look very different from the online titan you're used to. Alphabet aims to become a cross-sector conglomerate, a sprawling set of loosely connected products and services, where data-driven research is the common denominator that ties the whole group together. That's a winning strategy in the long run. The conglomerate idea frees Alphabet to start from the solid platform of cash and technology that Google built, and then point it in new directions as circumstances allow. Alphabet carries the second-largest market cap on the planet, but still has lots of room for growth over decades to come. I'm in for the long run, and would also be very comfortable with buying Alphabet shares in 2017. A leaner, meaner enterprise computing specialist You can think of Hewlett Packard Enterprise as the business-oriented side of the old Hewlett-Packard empire. The enterprise segment was spun out as a separate business in 2015, leaving HP Inc. to manage consumer products and printers. The two companies are still intertwined in many ways and could stand to put more space between them, but at least investors have the opportunity to focus on one specific aspect of the predecessor company's sprawling operations. From that starting point, Hewlett Packard Enterprise has moved on to refine its strategic plan and double down on profitable growth opportunities within its wheelhouse. The company spun out its low-margin enterprise services operations to merge with Computer Sciences Corporation, creating a new business entity known as DXC Technology. The cratering sales of the software division soon followed, moving out to U.K.-based sector peer Micro Focus in a deal worth $8.8 billion. A leaner, meaner company then turned around to acquire flash-based storage specialist Nimble Storage for $1 billion. The revamped Hewlett Packard Enterprise is a nearly pure play on enterprise services with a small side of financing operations. The company focuses on enterprise-class storage solutions, big-iron server systems, and the consulting services needed to run an HP-powered data center. Going forward, Hewlett Packard Enterprise is trading in nearly half of its annual revenue for a clearer business focus and much wider profit margins. You can buy into this evolving business at bargain-basement prices, coupled with a reasonably generous dividend policy. This is a low-risk pick in the information technology sector now that the corporate makeover has been completed, ideal for investors with little patience for volatility and surprises along the way. Image source: Getty Images. Diving deeper into security services Akamai Technologies runs a global network of content delivery services, based on specialized caching servers installed in connection hubs and data centers around the world. These caches used to speed up downloads of large files such as high-resolution graphics and digital video, and media customers accounted for the lion's share of Akamai's sales. As of 2017, the company is letting smaller rival Limelight Networks take much of the media traffic that used to mean so much, giving Limelight a new lease on life while Akamai turns toward the more profitable security market. The same caching servers can also serve as an effective cure for distributed denial of service (or DDoS) attacks. "Enterprises need solutions capable of defending against massive botnets that are exploiting millions of online devices," said Akamai CEO Tom Leighton in November 2016. "This is an area where Akamai's unique architecture and ongoing investments in global scale and security innovation continue to make a critical difference." Akamai's cloud security sales skyrocketed 44% higher in 2016, showing no signs of slowing down in 2017. Media delivery revenue dropped 10% lower, but the company seems to be comfortable with its new calling. Investors have yet to be convinced, driving share prices 30% lower in the first five months of 2017 while Limelight's investors enjoyed a 15% gain. But Akamai strikes a profit without breaking a sweat, and the security-focused future looks bright. Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

The technology giant is currently manufacturing a new smart home hub that would compete with Amazon Echo and Google Home, among others, Bloomberg is reporting, citing sources. The device could be unveiled on Monday at Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) event, but likely won't debut until later this year, the report says. Rumors have been swirling for months that suggest Apple is working on a new smart home hub. The device, the rumors have said, would be powered by its virtual personal assistant Siri and would control smart home devices. It might also interact with third-party apps. Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter A Siri-based speaker would put Apple (aapl) in direct competition with Amazon's Echo and Echo Show, as well as Google Home. All three devices similarly come with speakers and voice control. Amazon's devices are powered by its virtual personal assistant Alexa. Google Home is powered by its Alexa and Siri alternative Google Assistant. According to Bloomberg's sources, Apple's product would differ from Amazon (amzn) and Google's (googl) products by integrating with other products from the company, including the iPhone and iPad. Apple is also bundling loud speakers in the device in hopes of topping its competitors. However, like its competitors, the speaker would allow users to control smart home gadgets and play music, and would support third-party apps, the Bloomberg sources say. Last month, Apple senior vice president of worldwide marketing Phil Schiller criticized current smart home hubs for not having a display, suggesting that if Apple is indeed working on an alternative, it would come with a screen. While Amazon last month unveiled the Echo Show, which has a screen, the Bloomberg sources say the Siri-based speaker won't offer the feature. Apple is holding a keynote to kick off WWDC at 1 p.m. on Monday. The company is expected to focus on software during its address, but as Bloomberg's sources note, the speaker could make an appearance. Several rumors say Apple might also unveil a new iPad at the event. Apple did not respond to a Fortune request for comment.

A new Google feature can tell when someone who clicked on an ad in search results made a credit or debit card purchase at a corresponding physical store. The tool will give advertisers a better idea of how successful their online ad campaigns are. How does Google know if you bought something at Subway or Aldo? It works with the credit and debit card companies to match up in-store purchases with your online identity. The company has partnerships with companies that account for 70 percent of credit and debit card purchases in the U.S. The credit card companies provide Google with encrypted information about purchases, which Google software then compares to Google profiles of people who viewed relevant ads. Google cannot actually see any of the encrypted data, so it does not have access to identifiable payment information, like the person’s name or what they bought. The matches are tallied up in aggregate to protect privacy. That means Google can tell a restaurant their ads resulted in 1,000 people going there to eat and how much they spent, but not share any personal information about individual diners. For all its futuristic investments like self-driving cars, Internet-beaming balloons and thermostats, Google is still an advertising company. It relies on ad sales for the majority of its revenue. Last quarter, ads made up $21.4 billion of Alphabet’s $24.8 billion in sales. Making the connection between online ads and in-person purchases could be huge for the company, which is competing against companies like Facebook (FB, Tech30) for the same ad buyers. Google is also adding another real-world tool to get more customers into physical stores. It will show information for local stores on YouTube ads, such as hours and driving directions to the nearest store or chain location. In order to know what stores you’re close to, YouTube will rely on information from your location history. The company has been using this feature on Search and Maps since 2014. Google announced the tools at its annual advertising and marketing conference in San Francisco recently. The YouTube feature is well timed. Earlier this year, some advertisers pulled out of YouTube ads after they were shown alongside extremist videos. If the idea of Google tracking real world purchases, even in aggregate, unsettles you, there are ways to opt out. You can log out of your Google Account before using search, or turn off your search history so that it’s not saved. You can also use cash to buy your fast food.. For the local ad information tool, you can turn off your location history. Pinterest Gains Traction With Ad Buyers Pinterest has long been seen as a laggard behind the giant platforms, but it’s slowly gaining traction with one key constituency: ad buyers. After a slow start in advertising, Pinterest has released a slew of new features over the past year – and a newly aggressive agency strategy. Its quick product rollout, coupled with its emphasis on search and scale, has piqued the interest of agency executives. The moves come as Pinterest is reportedly plotting to go public this year — and hit $500 million in revenue. That would put it within striking distance of the far-younger Snap, which is forecast to pull in $770 million in revenue, and a far distance from the likes of Google and Facebook. The knock on Pinterest was that it lacked the scale and return of Google and Facebook, and the shiny newness of Snapchat. But Pinterest has impressed marketers with several analytics, targeting and ad options. Marketers can place a Pinterest conversion tag across their websites, which enables them to track existing users onto Pinterest and better target their ads. Pinterest Lens is a new visual search tool that detects objects in the real world and suggests a list of related items. While brands don’t have the option of surfacing their own products through this feature yet, marketers believe it is only a matter of time before Pinterest starts monetizing lenses this way. According to experts, Pinterest has also been focusing on building deeper relationships with agency partners over the past couple of months, especially in terms of creative collaboration. While Pinterest Lens is not an ad product yet, the Pinterest team has been working with the agency to “hack” the platform for clients. The newfound attentiveness stands in contrast to the old rap on Pinterest that it was stuck between Google and Facebook and lacked sufficiently sophisticated tools. Back in November, several ad buying executives told Digiday they were decidedly cool on the platform. One common complaint last fall: Pinterest’s archaic application programming interface. That no longer seems to be a concern, as the interface has become a lot more simplified and transparent. While Pinterest may be making strides, it should keep an eye out for competition, particularly when it comes to Amazon. Amazon already owns the bottom of the funnel – the people who are on their site or leveraging search have already expressed intent to purchase. Golden Mic | Gregg Allman & Band Branded Southern Rock Rock musician Gregg Allman – who died too young at age 69 – and his famous Allman Brothers Band branded the classic Southern rock genre, set the stage for the jam bands movement and influenced generations of players. Allman’s work and life is entwined with his brother Duane, with whom he founded the Allman Brothers Band in 1969. Two years later, Duane was killed in a motorcycle accident, but the band soldiered on, and reached new peaks with the 1973 album “Brothers and Sisters,” which featured signature songs “Ramblin’ Man” and the instrumental “Jessica.” Still, the band found their greatest success as a live act, performing for massive crowds in the 1970s and – like the Grateful Dead – influencing a future wave of concert-focused jam bands. Throughout their five-decade run – which included a few brief hiatuses – Allman was a constant presence, and his Hammond organ and soulful lead vocals defined their sound as much as his late brother’s limber guitar. Allman’s sound was further showcased through his solo work, which included six albums and the 1987 hit “I’m No Angel.” His last release, 2011’s “Low Country Blues,” entered the Billboard 200 at No. 5 — the highest chart position of his career. Earlier this year, Allman announced he was finishing work on his next album “Southern Blood.” He made many friends and inspired countless followers over the years, and several of them paid respects via social media. Charlie Daniels said Allman “had a feeling for the blues very few ever have,” adding it was “hard to believe that magnificent voice is stilled forever.” The Bonnaroo festival – which sprouted out of the jam band scene Allman helped foster – was quick to respond, as well. “Gregg Allman, thank you for everything. You’re our blue sky, our sunny day, and The Farm will miss you.” Although Allman’s mic has been silenced, his bodacious sound will continue to inspire generations as long as there is Southern and rock! Allman takes a very solid Golden Mic. » Todd Smith is president and chief communications officer of Deane, Smith & Partners, a full-service branding, PR, marketing and advertising firm with offices in Jackson.

Miller May 31, 2017 10 Comments Consumers and developers both will benefit from the latest news from Google I/O. To me, the biggest theme at last week's Google I/O conference was "democratizing AI"—in other words, making AI accessible both to end-users through its use in a variety of Google services, and to developers through new tools, programs, and even hardware designed around Google's TensorFlow AI framework. Google CEO Sundar Pichai started the conference out with a keynote in which he again stressed that the company was moving from a mobile-first to an AI-first approach, similarly to what he said last year. He said Google was "rethinking all our products and applying machine learning and AI to serve user's problems." He said machine learning algorithms already influence the ranking of different results in search, and how Street View now automatically recognizes signs. Other services are getting smarter because of AI, he said, such as how the Google Home now supports multiple users and how Gmail is now rolling out a "smart reply" feature where it automatically suggests responses to emails. To that end, he made a number of announcements of AI products, both for consumers and for developers. Lens, Assistant, and Photo use AI features For end-users, the most visible of these new efforts is Google Lens, a set of vision-based computing capabilities that can understand what you are seeing and take action, both in the Google Assistant and in Google Photos. For instance, he demonstrated how you can take a picture of a flower, and how Google Lens can now identify it. More prosaically, it can take a picture of a username and password for Wi-Fi, and then automatically understand that you want to connect and do that for you. Other examples include taking a picture of the outside of a restaurant and having the software understand what it is, then showing you user reviews and menus. This isn't all completely new, but I can imagine that it will be quite useful—the kind of thing we'll all be using pretty much by rote in a few years. Google says this will be rolling out in a few months. Google Assistant continues to get smarter and will incorporate the Google Lens, though the biggest news on that from is that Assistant is now coming to the iPhone. The popular Google Photos app is also getting a number of other new AI-driven features, including "suggested sharing," where it will automatically select the best pictures and suggest you share them with the people in the photos. Google Photos is also adding a feature that automatically will let you share all or part of your library, so that if you take photos of your kids, they automatically become part of your partner's photo library as well. And it can suggest the best photos for a photo book. AI-First Data Centers and New Development Tools On the internal side, Pichai talked about how the company was "rethinking" its computational architecture to build "AI-first data centers." He said Google uses its current Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) across all its services, from basic search to speech recognition to its AlphaGo competition. I was particularly intrigued by the company's introduction of a new version of its TPU 2.0, which Pichai said was capable of reaching 180 teraflops (180 trillion floating point operations per second) per 4-chip board, or 11.5 petaflops in each "pod" of 64 such boards. These are available to developers as "cloud TPUs" on the Google Cloud Engine now, and the company said it would make 1000 cloud TPUs available to machine learning researchers via its new TensorFlow Research Cloud. This is part of an increasing push on TensorFlow, the company's open source machine learning framework for developers, and the conference had a variety of sessions aimed at getting more developers to use this framework. TensorFlow appears to be the most popular of the machine learning frameworks, but it's only one of a number of choices. (Others include Caffe, which is pushed by Facebook, and MXNet, pushed by Amazon Web Services.) I went to a session on "TensorFlow for Non-Experts" designed to evangelize the framework and the Keras deep learning library, and it was packed. It's fascinating stuff, but not as familiar as the more traditional development tools. All the big companies say they are having trouble finding enough developers with machine learning expertise, so it's no surprise to see all of them pushing their internal frameworks. While the tools to use these are getting better, it's still complicated. Of course, just calling an existing model is much easier, and Google Cloud Platform, as well as Microsoft and AWS, all have a variety of such ML services developers can use. Because developing such services is so hard, Pichai spent a lot of time talking about "AutoML," an approach that has neural nets designing new neural networks. He said Google hopes that AutoML will take an ability that a few PhDs have today and will make it possible for hundreds of thousands of developers to design new neural nets for their particular needs in three to five years. This is part of a larger effort called Google.ai to bring AI to more people, with Pichai talking about a variety of initiatives to using AI to help in health care. He talked about pathology and cancer detection, DNA sequencing, and molecule discovery. Continuing the theme, Dave Burke, head of Android engineering, announced a new version of TensorFlow optimized for mobile called TensorFlow lite. The new library will allow developers to build leaner deep learning models designed to run on Android smartphones, and he talked about how mobile processor designers were working on specific accelerators in their processors or DSPs designed for neural network inferencing and even training. In the developer keynote, Fei Fei Li, a Stanford professor who heads Google's AI research, said she joined Google "to ensure that everyone can leverage AI to stay competitive and solve the problems that matter most to them." She talked a lot about "Democratizing AI," including the various tools Google makes available to developers for specific applications, such as vision, speech, translation, natural language, and video intelligence, as well as making tools for creating your own models, such as TensorFlow, which is easier to use with more high-level APIs. She talked about how developers will now be able to use CPUs, GPUS, or TPUs on the Google Compute Engine. She gave an example of how much of a speed improvement some models have running on TPUs, saying the research implications of this are significant. Echoing Pichai, she touted the new TensorFlow Research Cloud, saying students and Kaggle users should apply to use it; and concluded by saying the firm created its cloud AI team to make AI democratic, to meet you where you are, with Google's most power AI tools, and to share the journey as you put these to use.

By Liam Tung | June 1, 2017 -- 13:55 GMT (06:55 PDT) | Topic: Innovation Timelines show 50 percent probability intervals for achieving various AI milestones. Image: Katja Grace et al/Oxford University/Yale University Google has hung up its AlphaGo gloves after trouncing the world's best human Go players, but when will AI beat humans at other tasks, such as writing a best-selling novel or doing surgery? To answer that question, a team of researchers led by Katja Grace of Oxford University's Future of Humanity Institute surveyed several hundred machine-learning experts to get their educated guess. The researchers used the responses to calculate the median number of years it would take for AI to reach key milestones in human capabilities. Teachers may need to be on the alert for machine-written essays by 2026 and truck drivers could be made redundant by 2027, according to the results. Meanwhile, AI will surpass human capabilities in retail by 2031. The experts also predict that AI will be capable of writing a best-seller by 2049, and doing a surgeon's work by 2053. Overall, the respondents believe there is a 50 percent chance that AI beats humans at all tasks in 45 years and will automate all human jobs within 120 years. The researchers invited the views of all 1,634 authors of papers published in 2015 at two of the leading machine-learning conferences, Neural Information Processing Systems and the International Conference on Machine Learning. A total of 352 researchers responded. Interestingly, the researchers predict that AI won't beat the best human Go players until about 2028. As we know, Google beat Korean Go champ, Lee Sedol, in 2016, and just beat Chinese grandmaster Ke Ji. Google is now putting its AlphaGo developers from its DeepMind lab to work on solving bigger challenges to society. But as Grace et al point out in the paper, the machine-learning experts were asked when AI could beat a human at Go on the condition that opponents had played or been trained on the same number of games. "For reference, DeepMind's AlphaGo has probably played a hundred million games of self-play, while Lee Sedol has probably played 50,000," they note. In fact, if the researchers' predictions are right, we're likely to see a two-legged robot beat humans in a 5km road race before AI beats a human Go player on equal terms. The survey also asked the researchers about the likelihood of an AI "intelligence explosion", or the point at which AI becomes better than humans at AI design. As physicist Stephen Hawking explained, if that situation occurs, it could result in "machines whose intelligence exceeds ours by more than ours exceeds that of snails". Specifically, researchers were asked about the chances of an intelligence explosion happening within two years of machines having learned to do every task better and more cheaply than humans. That is, within about 45 years. Respondents overall see it as "possible but improbable", with a median probability of 10 percent. They also see it as likely to have positive outcomes but there is a five percent chance of an "extremely bad" outcome, like human extinction.

Google’s Spokesman Taiwo Kola-Ogunlade made the announcement in Lagos on Thursday. Kola-Ogunlade, who is Google’s Communications and Public Affairs Manager for Anglophone West Africa, said the searches were apparently to know more about Biafra. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that some groups observed a sit-at-home protest on May 30, to commemorate the 50th anniversary since the Biafra uprising ended. Kola-Ogunlade said that Nigerians searched for Democracy Day, Biafra News, Biafra Day, Tiger Woods, Ernesto Valverde and Paul Pogba in the search engine. According to him, a group, the Muslim Rights Concern (MURIC) has rejected May 29 as Nigeria’s Democracy Day, describing it as fraudulent, unrealistic and escapist. “The group asked the Federal Government to declare June 12 as Democracy Day instead. “May 29 was chosen by the last military regime of Gen. Abdul Salaam Abubakar. “Nigerian researched more on the topic on Google search using the terms: ‘when is democracy day in Nigeria.’ The spokesman said that Nigerians also searched for: “why do we celebrate democracy day in Nigeria. “History of democracy day in Nigeria and democracy day 2017”. The searches commenced on May 25 and ended on May 31. Kola-Ogunlade said there was total shutdown in Nigeria’s South East on May 30, following the Indigenous People of Biafra’s sit-at-home order. He said that the order was to mark the 50th anniversary of the declaration of the defunct Republic of Biafra and also to honour heroes and heroines of the liberation struggle. The Google chief said that the sit-at-home order was totally complied with in the five states in the South East. Kola-Ogunlade explained that people searched Google using terms such as ‘Biafra news today’, ‘Biafra latest news’, ‘radio Biafra news’ and ‘radio Biafra’. The spokesman said that Golf superstar, Tiger Woods’ arrest and charge for Driving Under the Influence (DUI) by the police in Florida on May 29 also trended on Google. He said that the former golf world number one had to deal with a fresh blow as he struggled to resurrect his career. “Nigerians went on Google to search for ‘Tiger Woods net worth’, ‘Tiger Woods arrested’, ‘Tiger Woods news’, ‘DUI’ and ‘Serena Williams’. The Google chief said that Barcelona FC President, Josep Bartomeu, on May 29 officially confirmed the appointment of Ernesto Valverde as the club’s new head coach, replacing Luis Enrique. Kola-Ogunlade said that sports fanatics Googled ‘Ernesto Valverde profile’, ‘Barcelona’, ‘Who is Ernesto Valverde’ and ‘Barcelona new coach.’ He also said that Paul Pogba’s visit to Mecca to give thanks for a good season trended on Google. “Paul Pogba visited Islam’s holiest city, Mecca this week to pray and offer his appreciation for a successful season with Manchester United and to mark the beginning of Ramadan. “Nigerians visited Google to search ‘Paul Pogba religion’, ‘Is Paul pogba a Muslim’, ‘Paul Pogba profile’ and ‘Paul Pogba biography’,” Kola-Ogunlade said. Google Trends launched in May, 2006, allows one to see how popular search terms and their demography have been overtime on the search engine.

Designed by Bjarke Ingels Group and Heatherwick Studios, the team behind TfL’s New Bus for London and the 2012 Olympic Cauldron, the building will stand 11 storeys tall and stretch parallel to the platforms of London’s King’s Cross railway station. Combined with Google’s current King’s Cross office around the corner, and a third building that the company also plans on moving into in the area, it will form a new campus that will house 7,000 Google employees. Dubbed a “landscraper”, the finished building will be longer than the Shard is tall. Related video: Google Home review - an Amazon Echo killer?

Google Cloud has become the first major cloud provider to offer Virtual machine instances using Intel’s Skylake processors. The Skylake Xeon processors, which are now generally available, include up to 64 vCPUs and 455GB of RAM supporting a range of compute-intensive workloads, data analytics and engineering simulations. Google Cloud revealed that the customer demand for Intel’s Skylake has increased and since its launch for the Compute Engine in February, customers have run several hours of compute Skylake VMs. According to Google, the new general availability release enables customers to create new VMs with Skylake across all the VM instance types in Compute Engine. This includes standard, highmen, highcpu, Custom Machine types and Preemptible VMs. Read more: Google Cloud boosts machine learning portfolio with Nvidia GPUs The decision to begin offering virtual machine instances using Intel’s processors is a smart move made by Google to compete against its rival cloud providers such as AWS, which announced a set of Skylake-powered C5 instances for its Elastic Compute Cloud in 2016 but are still yet to launch. The Google Cloud Platform also released several updates to its Compute Engine to allow developers to easily select their preferred CPU platform for VMs within a particular Google Cloud region, whilst also being able to choose the suited CPU features. Developers were previously restricted with the amount of RAM space per vCPU they were entitled to, but Google has now extended the memory and removed the restrictions to up memory space to a maximum of 455GB per VM instance. This helps Google offer a wider memory space to user applications that may benefit from flexible memory configurations for better performance. Google Cloud has made Skylake available in three of its regions, Western US, Western Europe and Eastern Asia Pacific with general availability across every region at no extra cost for a limited time.     Tags Google Cloud Platform Intel Processors Previous Article5G – A building block for the smarter city Next ArticleOneLogin data breach: Encrypted info at risk following hack on password manager Most read Hackers turn political saboteurs as cracks in the cloud signal a new frontier for cyber crime Ellie Burns 26th April 2017 IBM brings cognitive assistant to factory for cutting down inspection time Byomakesh Biswal 25th April 2017 Oracle, the newest tech startup?

Google, who will be moving to Kings Cross, London in 2018, have decided to update their plans for the US$1 billion employee pad which will provide a work space for around 4,500 people. Documents show that the Google building will have seven to 11 storeys and will include facilities only seen in a five star hotel. According to an expert, all of this has been done to ensure the health and well-being of staff and to foster the innovation and creativity that defines the organization. A 300 meter long landscaped roof terrace with areas described as "fields" and "gardens" will also be included. The architects have also taken into consideration a place where runners can train and walkers can leisurely enjoy tranquil places for rest and relaxation. There will also be a roof top cafe. A 25 meter swimming pool will form part of a "wellness and fitness center," which will also include a gym, exercise studio and a 32 meter long indoor "multi-use games area" for sports such as basketball, five-a-side football or badminton. Joe Borrett, director of real estate and construction said that the project was an exciting one. "We are excited to be able to bring our London Googlers together in one campus, with a new purpose-built building that we've developed from the ground up," Mr. Borrett said in a recent interview." "Our offices and facilities play a key part in shaping the Google culture, which is one of the reasons we are known for being amongst the best places to work in the industry," he added. One source said that the building is a fascinating collision of diversity and the external mix around the structure of massive railway stations, roads, canals and other infrastructure is brilliant. ...

Sources suggest Apple could be unveiling the speakers at the annual developer conference on 5 to 9 June in San Jose, with a public release later in the year. The product is believed to be aimed at bringing Apple AI into the home, but will have a higher price tag that the Amazon range, which begins at $49 (£49) for the Echo Dot. Scroll down for video Sources say Apple could be unveiling the Siri speakers at the annual developer conference on 5 to 9 June with release later in the year.  The speaker would be a key rival to the Amazon Echo (pictured) and Google Home APPLE'S SIRI-DRIVEN SMART SPEAKER The product is believed to be aimed at bringing Apple AI into the home, and will have a higher price tag that the Amazon range, which begins at $49 (£49) for the Echo Dot. The speaker will provide a hub for appliances via Apple's HomeKit system and establish a centre inside the home to lock people in to using other Apple services, according to the report. A speaker might help customers stay loyal to other services such as Apple Music, Apple Watch, Apple TV and AirPods.  Insiders suggest that Siri's advanced acoustics technology may give it the edge over competitors. The company has considered including sensors that automatically adjust audio levels dependent on the acoustics of a room, insiders said. The speaker will provide a hub inside the home to lock people in to using other Apple services, writes Bloomberg.  It might encourage customers to stay loyal to other services such as Apple Music, Apple Watch, Apple TV and AirPods. These products generated the company $11 billion (£8.5 billion) last year. Sources suggest Apple employees have already been testing the speaker for months. The firm is known for unveiling new technologies at its Worldwide Developers Conference and this year’s conference might be the first in three years to introduce new hardware. Insiders suggest that Siri's advanced acoustics technology may give it the edge over competitors. The company has considered including sensors that automatically adjust audio levels dependent on the acoustics of a room, insiders said. It is believed a third-party will build products for the speaker.  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Drones take to the skies to supply DOUGHNUTS: UAVs team up...

Share this article Share According to 9to5 Mac, KGI analyst Ming-Chi Kuo calls it 'Apple's first home AI product', and says it will feature 'excellent' sound with seven tweeters and a subwoofer. 'It will be positioned as a more premium product than the Echo…with a higher price tag to match, the site says. According to Mr Kuo, Apple hopes to ship around 10 million of these as-yet-unannounced devices in the first year, and it will be made by Inventec, the same company that made Apple's AirPods.  A leak in April revealed that the Cupertino company is 'currently finalizing' its own smart speaker, which is said to be marketed as a 'Siri/AirPlay device' Sonny Dickson, who is known for sharing inside information in the tech world, said it could also 'carry some form of Beats technology and is expected to run on variant iOS' A leak in April by Sonny Dickson, who is known for sharing inside information in the tech world, revealed the Cupertino company is 'currently finalizing' its smart speaker, which is said to be marketed as a 'Siri/AirPlay device.' It also noted that the Siri-driven device could 'carry some form of Beats technology and is expected to run on variant iOS.'  Mr Dickson also told Mashable that it would have a 'concave top' with the controls, 'Mac Pro style.'  Insiders suggest Siri's advanced acoustics technology may give it the edge over competitors. The company has considered including sensors that automatically adjust audio levels dependent on the acoustics of a room, insiders said (stock image)  Adding AirPlay support to the device would let users 'push music, radio, and podcasts to the Apple hardware over Wi-Fi, which typically offers better quality than Bluetooth,' Apple Insider reported. Apple has yet to make an official announcement regarding their Siri-enabled smart speaker.

Facebook Twitter Pintrest LinkedIn Google+ Mail Comment Modular phones are in a rather interesting spot. At the end of 2016 Google canned Project Ara, its open-source modular mobile project. In 2017, the latest LG G-series unceremoniously ditched the company's lacklustre "Friends" modules. Motorola, on the other hand, is forging onward with Moto Mods - magnetic clip-on back panel accessories with differing functions that connect with its Z-series smartphones. The latest device to support Mods is the Moto Z2 Play: a 5.5-inch phone with mid-power specification and oodles of battery life wrapped into a slender metal frame, which updates last year's original battery-heavy Z Play. As the apparent last bastion of the modular mobile movement, the Z2 Play is not only the flag-bearer for Moto Mods, but for modular phones as a whole in 2017 and beyond. And with a US price of $499 (we anticipate a similar UK price, around £449 when the device launches in Blighty this July), it's on the right side of affordable to make it an attractive idea. That said, the Z2 Play is invariably pitched against the imminent (and likely more powerful) OnePlus 5. So, is Moto's modular quirk a useful enough feature to warrant its purchase? We've been using the Z2 Play day in, day out for a full week to find out. Moto Z2 Play review: Design Moto Mods compatible 156.2 x 76.2 x 5.99mm (without Mod) Metal design with water-resistance 64GB storage; microSD card slot 3.5mm headphones jack Lunar Grey or Fine Gold finishes If you've ever seen the original Moto Z Play then, well, the Z2 Play looks like business as usual at first glance. It's taken the 5.5-inch footprint of the original - an unavoidable and non-negotiable size, given the Mods need to match the rear panel exactly to fit - and trimmed a full millimetre of thickness from it, making for a lighter, more pocket-friendly device at sub-6mm. Why slimmer? There will be no "standard" Moto Z2, so the Play is left to rule the roost for now. Pocket-lint Look closer, however, and there are notable differences between first- and second-gen models. The Z2 Play has an all-metal frame, including the exposed rear plate (when no Mod is attached), rather than the etched glass rear of the original device. That makes it less slippery to handle, which is an obvious benefit when switching between Mods and not lobbing the phone on the floor. At least, we've managed to not let slip just yet. The other obvious point - which we'll come to in more detail later - is the new fingerprint scanner to the front. It's out with the old square format and in with the new elongated form, just as you'll find on Moto G5 Plus and Moto G5 models (plus, presumably, all future Moto handsets). It looks, feels and functions far better. Pocket-lint When we saw the original Moto Z, we found its appearance more pock-marked than a hormonal teenager. The Z2 Play keeps things neater: there aren't excessive openings for microphones to the front, instead a simple aperture for the speaker sits top and centre, between the discreet front-facing camera and flash. It's not a design that'll stop people in their tracks, like the Samsung Galaxy S8, but it's a tidy looking phone nonetheless. Moto Z2 Play review: Moto Mods New: JBL SoundBoost 2 speaker with kickstand, $80, available at launch New: Style Shells with wireless charging (finishes: wood, fabric, flower digital print), $40, available at launch New: TurboPower Pack (3490mAh, with TurboPower charging speeds), $80, available summer 2017 New: Moto Power Pack (2200mAh), $50, available at launch More Mods coming in the near future, including GamePad For this review we received three Mods: a wooden Moto Style Shell with wireless charge (note, no wireless charging panel is included with either phone or Mod, it's a separate purchase); the JBL SoundBoost 2, which is the second-gen fabric-covered version of the attachable speaker with kickstand; and the Moto TurboPower Pack, an additional 3490mAh capacity for the battery. Pocket-lint Whichever way we look at it, we think Mods are divisive. If you're on board with the idea then we suspect these accessories will be the in-point and very reason to purchase a Z-series. If you're non-plussed about them then, well, there are plenty of other handsets on the market from which to take your pick - and it's easy to buy a separate universal battery pack or speaker at similar prices for any given device. On the upside, however, Moto Mods are the best implementation of modular accessories for any device that we've seen. Pull a Mod from the rear of the Z2 Play, sling a new one into place and - boom - that's it. No buttons, release switches or complicated fitting at all - the phone knows what's connected right off the bat. There's even a dedicated Mods section within the software, available via a swipe down in the notifications shade, to keep a closer eye on things. The future potential of Mods makes for interesting reading, too. We've seen the GamePad, a control-laden cradle for the Z-series, perfect for gaming fans - which will join the existing 10x zoom Hasselblad True Zoom camera and Moto Insta-Share Projector. There's scope for plenty of interesting additions beyond just yet another battery pack - although, right now, various battery forms seem to be Moto's bread and butter releases. It's also worth keeping in mind that you'll pretty much have to buy a Mod when purchasing a Z2, as there isn't one included. Fail to connect one to the rear and, while the phone will function as normal, it looks downright bizarre. With the rear connection pins exposed, the Z2 Play looks like a prototype; an unfinished device crying out for its back panel. Which Mod or Mods you choose needs careful consideration too: the TurboPower Pack is huge, for example, and thus transforms the Z2 Play into a brickphone. Sure, it'll last seemingly forever, which might be the most important thing for your use, but it makes the phone abnormally massive and heavy to be considered as a current flagship contender. Pocket-lint Or all the Mods we settled on the most simple one for the most part: the Moto Style Shell. Finished in wood - different colours and materials, including fabric, will also be available - it makes the phone look, well, kind of normal. The only glitch here is that wood can bend due to heat and moisture, so our pre-release sample doesn't sit perfectly flush with the phone, which is less than ideal. Moto Z2 Play review: Display 5.5in 1920 x 1080 pixel Super AMOLED panel On the display front, the Z2 Play hasn't made any advances over the original Z Play model, opting for a 5.5-inch Full HD AMOLED panel as before. Pocket-lint Not only is that perfectly good in resolution terms in this mid-area market, it's a degree better than what you'll find in many $499 phones thanks to its use of an AMOLED panel. Unlike LCD this technology illuminates per pixel, rather than using a backlight, which is better for power consumption, ensures richer blacks and an even brighter colour palette. Not that the Z2 Play's colour saturation is as audacious as you'll find in, say, the Sony Xperia XZ Premium. Its colours are bright without being overworked, while brightness is ample, although the auto-brightness does seem to prefer a middling position (it avoids going unfathomably dark like some competitor handsets, however, such as Huawei). Pocket-lint There's no ultra-HD resolution to be found here, nor does this screen tick the boxes to cater for mobile HDR content delivery like the flagship LG G6 and Samsung Galaxy S8 models do. Not that we expected that; we think the Z2 Play sits perfectly well in its position as a sub-flagship. Moto Z2 Play review: Fingerprint scanner, gesture control and software Front-positioned fingerprint scanner (plus NFC) One-button Nav for gesture-based controls Android 7.1, Google Assistant included Moto Actions/Display/Voice software additions We've already mentioned the presence of the front-positioned fingerprint scanner, but it warrants further exploration given its capabilities. Pocket-lint The scanner sits in a slight indentation to the bottom of the Z2 Play's front, which is subtle enough to make it look barely noticeable while being easy to locate. It isn't a depressible button, but it does provide haptic (vibrational) feedback that makes it feel like something approaching a real clicky button (much like in Apple's latest iPhones). One of the best things about the scanner is that it offers Moto's One-button Nav control. This mode removes the usual trio of Android soft keys - home, back and recent apps - from the screen, instead offering them as finger-input gestures on the scanner itself. Swipe left to go back; swipe right to open current apps; press to return home (or the lock screen); or press-and-hold to activate Google Assistant. Activating One-button Nav doesn't necessarily make navigating the Z2 Play quicker than using the soft keys, but it does open up more on-screen real estate for content and, given the size of this particular phone, we think makes it easier to use one-handed without needing to reach over the screen. Having used the Moto G5 and G5 Plus in this format for a number of weeks, we've settled into it comfortably. In addition to One-touch Nav as part of Moto Actions within the pre-installed Moto app - which includes physical movements to produce actions; things like "karate chop to activate torch" - there's also Moto Display and Moto Voice found here. The last of these three is essentially Moto's modded route into Google Assistant. So, for example, say "show me the weather" and the Z2 Play will pop-up a window to do just that. There's no need to press anything or say "OK, Google" like you would with Google Assistant. Moto Voice works quite differently to Assistant, however, typically prompting you to open apps via a swipe down rather than automatically opening them (sensible, given the carnage that could otherwise ensue in public). It uses the same format as Moto Display, showing alerts for five seconds full-screen before fading them out, which means there's no visible dialogue window like with Google Assistant. That can be handy if the phone is on the table across the room and you want to make simple requests. But having both Assistant and Voice seems kind of unnecessary. As those three major pillars - Actions, Display and Voice - are contained within the Moto app, which sits front and centre, there's little else that gets in the way of the Z2 Play's Android 7.1 operating system. There is the addition of Mods, of course, but that's the lot. That means everything looks clean and tidy, works 99 per cent like stock Google Android, and will be easy to pick up for newbies and familiar for established Android users. Moto Z2 Play review: Performance, software and battery Snapdragon 626 octa-core processor (2.2Ghz); 4GB RAM 3,000mAh battery, TurboPower charging (via USB-C) Having used the Z2 Play for a week, we thought that Moto had made a mistake informing us it houses a Snapdragon 626 processor - because the phone runs like one that's a flagship, not a mid-ranger by any means. Pocket-lint Flicking around the interface has presented no issues, while games have performed without stutters and pauses - which isn't even something we can say of some current flagship models, such as the Huawei P10 Plus. Load times don't feel long, either, aided by the 4GB RAM on offer. What's perhaps even more impressive is just how long the Z2 Play lasts. Having shaved a full millimetre from its thickness compared to the original device, the second-gen model has, of course, downscaled its battery capacity too. The 3,000mAh cell still sounds reasonable (despite dropping 510mAh compared to the original Z Play), but it still performs much like a 4,000mAh cell from our use. A typical day with the Z2 Play has seen us achieve 15 to 16 hours of use with around 30 to 40 per cent battery remaining when going to bed. And seeing as we've been intermittently playing Candy Crush and Magikarp in among our usual work-related tasks each day, we think that's very good innings indeed. When failing to charge overnight once, we still had 15 per cent battery remaining by lunchtime the next day. Those quotes are when just using the built-in battery. If you're a battery fiend then the addition of Mods can be hugely useful. The TurboPower Pack makes the Z2 Play almost unstoppable, for example. With that attached our device lasted a full working day, before we boarded a trans-Atlantic flight, saw us through the remainder of the second day and then off to bed at 10pm with 47 per cent still in the tank. All-in, that was a 33 hour stint - and we suspect the remainder would have seen us through another eight hours or more before calling it a day. So if battery is your thing then, well, few phones can compete with the longevity of the Z2 Play. That's down to a savvy ensemble of specs - AMOLED, Full HD only, mid-power processor - that work in logical harmony. It doesn't disappoint. Moto Z2 Play review: Cameras 12MP Dual Autofocus Pixel Camera Sensor-based autofocus pixels (more than 3 million) Enhanced laser autofocus (works to 5 metres) 5MP front camera, includes Moto's first Dual CCT flash A new generation means a new camera. The Z2 Play hasn't gone overboard, opting for a single optic with a 12-megapixel sensor at its heart. Pocket-lint However, that sensor has seen a serious upgrade. It includes more than three million autofocus pixels on its surface meaning that, in Professional mode within the camera app, a super-fast autofocus mode will be available. Watch the in-focus points highlight in real-time as green squares on screen, which is nifty, just like a real camera. Problem is, just as we said of the Moto G5 Plus, those more advanced focusing options aren't put to best use. In the standard mode the camera requires the usual tap-the-screen approach, with speed that isn't class leading. It has the same glitch which sees the focus point reset to the centre when adjusting it too. Best advice, therefore, is stick with the Professional mode, as it's just speedier. It also features manual focus, white balance, shutter speed, ISO sensitivity and exposure compensation dials to take full control as you please - or leave them blank to get an automated shooting experience. With an f/1.7 aperture lens plenty of light can reach the sensor too, putting the Z2 Play up there among the flagships. There's no optical stabilisation, however, which can be felt when shooting in low-light scenarios - we needed an extra steady hand when shooting sunset shots to ensure sharp results. As seems typical of Moto, images look great on screen but appear a little over-sharpened when viewing them at full scale on a larger computer monitor. Not terribly so, but a subtler processing would be better. What the Z2 Play does show off is how good this sensor can be. We shot condiment bottles in a dim-lit burger joint and even with ISO 1250 selected (about as high as the camera wants to auto-select) the detail in the walls is commendable, with image noise to a minimum. Sure, there's the typical mottling seen in single colour areas that you'll find in any mobile phone image, but it's still a good result. Pocket-lint Give the Z2 Play's camera even better light and you'll see even better results. The kind of results that see Moto climbing up a peg or two in the camera world. It's not best-in-class still, but it's a solid setup at this level. Verdict If you find Moto Mods enticing then the Z2 Play is a super phone with plenty to offer beyond its quirky unique selling point. If Mods leave you cold given their cost and size implication then, well, we think Moto will be in a great place to deliver an excellent Moto X (rumoured to be in the third quarter of 2017), which might well be the perfect fit. Between now and then, however, we suspect the imminent OnePlus 5 will ask some tough questions.  Ignoring Mods for a moment, however, and it's hard to ignore how well the Z2 Play runs. The subtle design tweaks compared to the previous-gen Play makes for a more slender and tidier appearance, the all-metal material choice makes far more sense than glass, the processor selection sees the software work effortlessly, the One-button Nav gesture control is easy to use, and battery life is hugely impressive. In that regard the Moto Z2 Play really does have all the mod cons, then, eh? There are little to no slip-ups in use, which secure this phone a commendable position in the mid-range market. And if battery life is your all then it ought to be the perfect companion. The alternatives to consider Pocket-lint OnePlus 3T £399 Ok, so it's due to be discontinued around the time the Moto is announced, but OnePlus is the name to watch in the mid-level market. There are no modular features to worry about in this phone, of course, instead it's all about high power for a lower-than-flagship price. And its imminent follow-up, the OnePlus 5, is likely to be the mid-level phone of 2017. Read the full article: OnePlus 3T review Pocket-lint Lenovo P2 £199 If you're looking to go lower budget but want a phone with strong battery performance then the Lenovo P2 - which is similar to the Moto G5 Plus - crams a 5,100mAh battery into its rear for seemingly never-ending battery life. It's not as powerful or smooth to operate as the Moto Z2 Play, but for under £200 it's a steal. Read the full article: Lenovo P2 review Sections Motorola Lenovo Phones What are Moto Mods?
