For convenience, Google will not close these private searches when you leave the app. You will have to do that yourself. A friendly reminder, though. Going incognito doesn’t mean you’re completely private. It “doesn’t hide your browsing from your employer, your internet service provider, or the websites you visit.” The Google app won’t hide your searches from Google, either, but it won’t tie them to your account. One other feature added to the Google app on iOS is allowing you to watch YouTube videos directly in the app. Nicole Batac | Post a Comment | Share Article Print Article Permalink tagged Google app, iOS Email Article in Apple, First Looks, Google, Mobile, News, app news Reader Comments There are no comments for this journal entry.

San Francisco District Court Judge William Alsup denied [PDF] Oracle's latest motion to have the case reheard, this time on grounds of misconduct on the part of Google's lawyers. The legal war, which has been tied up in various phases since 2010, was ultimately decided in Google's favor and has since been appealed by Oracle multiple times. In this latest effort, Oracle had accused Google's legal team of failing to disclose the Chocolate Factory's intent to develop tools to run Android on the desktop via the Android App Runtime for Chrome (ARC). This, Oracle charged, would have nullified Google's contention that its use of Java APIs was limited to mobile devices and could be considered fair use, as its code did not compete with Oracle's own software. Alsup, however, shot down that argument, denying Oracle's motion. The judge reasoned that Oracle and Google had agreed that in this specific case, the focus was only to be on the smartphone and tablet implementations of Android. "It may well be true that the use of the copyrighted APIs in ARC++ (or any other later use) will not qualify as a fair use, but that will not and does not mean that Google's argument on transformative use as to the original uses on trial (smartphones and tablets) was improper," the judge wrote. "That Oracle failed to detect the ARC++ documents in its possession had no consequence within the defined scope of our trial." Additionally, Alsup argues, Oracle is picking and choosing what important data in the case should be added and what should be omitted. He notes that while the ARC++ information could help Oracle's claim, another document left out of the original trial would have backed up Google's side of the story by showing that Oracle/Sun offered an open Java API years earlier. "Sun itself had given away Java (including all of the lines of code in suit) in 2008 via its open-source OpenJDK. In 2015, Google used OpenJDK to reimplement the Java APIs for the latest release of Android, which it called Nougat," Alsup pointed out. "Google wished to use this evidence under the fourth fair use factor to show that its infringement did no more market harm than Sun itself had already invited via its own OpenJDK release." Oracle and Google declined to comment on the ruling. ® Sponsored: Customer Identity and Access Management Tips and corrections 29 Comments More from The Register Oracle lawyers prevail in copyright case (No, not that, the other one) Rimini Street will have to foot $46m legal bill 4 Comments Microsoft lures top Linux exec from Oracle to Redmond Wim Coekaerts' hire another sign of open source push 92 Comments Oracle Java copyright war latest: Why Google's luck is about to run out Analysis Database giant claims web ads goliath tricked court, Android isn't just phones 58 Comments $10bn Oracle v Google copyright jury verdict: Google wins, Java APIs in Android are Fair Use Big Red tells us it immediately plans to appeal 117 Comments Oracle v Google: Big Red wants $9.3bn in Java copyright damages And the judge wants to ban lawyers from Googling jury members 59 Comments Oracle campaigns for third Android Java infringement trial Android on Chrome in the spotlight 30 Comments Whitepapers Data and Analytics Maturity Model and Business Impact How top performing enterprises use their IT investments to store, process, and use data to make more effective, real-time decisions.

PC-Tablet Videos Tech Apps Telecom Science Business Social Auto Reviews How-To’s Featured Google Pixel and Pixel XL specs, price, release date, images: Everything we know so far By Abhinav Mishra - 30/09/2016 Google is all set to showcase some new hardware for us smartphone nuts. The company has already sent media invites for an event slated for October 4 in San Francisco. Besides, they’ve also posted a teaser video that shows a rectangular Google search bar that in the end transforms into a smartphone. Now this clearly suggests Google will most likely show off the highly-anticipated Pixel smartphones – Pixel and Pixel XL. These are the ones that will probably take over the Nexus range, and become the company’s signature flagships from now. In essence, 2016 could mark a new beginning for Google with their very first Pixel phone. Hence, we’ve compiled a list handy list of everything we know so far, and what Google will unveil at the upcoming event. Google Pixel and Pixel XL Google has been promoting its event under the slogan “Made by Google,” which fuels existing rumors about the company ditching the Nexus brand in favor of Pixel. These upcoming smartphones will likely be called Google Pixel and Pixel XL, and made by Taiwanese manufacturer HTC. Google Pixel The Pixel is the smaller of the two and is expected to get a 5-inch full HD display, and the Pixel XL will be the high-end variant with a 5.5-inch Quad HD AMOLED display and a larger battery. Apart from this, both devices share the same set of specs which include a Snapdragon 821 processor bundled with Adreno 530 graphics, 4GB of RAM and 32GB of built-in storage. Besides, rumors also suggest a 13MP primary camera along with an 8MP selfie shooter. They are expected to come in Black and White color options. Google Pixel XL As far as pricing goes, it seems Google is going all guns blazing to take on the likes of iPhone 7 and the Galaxy S7. Android Police reports that upcoming Pixel smartphones will start at $649, which is the kind of price tag reserved for flagships from Samsung and Apple. Not to forget, both devices will likely run the latest Android 7.0 Nougat out-of-the-box, with support for Google’s DayDream VR headset. Google DayDream At it’s I/O conference back in May, Google revealed its plans to go full throttle in the VR space and announced the DayDream VR platform. Hence, we can expect the company to show off its DayDream VR headset running on upcoming Pixel smartphones. Google has reportedly made a huge investment to ensure there’s enough VR content for its DayDream VR platform when it launches. Besides, reports do indicate that Google is expected to launch the headset alongside its latest smartphones. 4K-ready Chromecast Google launched it’s first Chromecast back in 2013, an affordable HDMI dongle that essentially makes your television a SmartTV. It lets you wirelessly cast content onto your television screen. The Chromecast update has been due for over a year now. And it seems the company is finally prepping the launch of its 3rd generation model alongside its Pixel phones, that’ll reportedly have 4K capabilities. Though, we’re not sure if the 4K Chromecast will be as economical as it’s predecessors. Google Home Google is also expected to reveal more information about its Amazon-echo like device called Google Home. It’s essentially a voice-activated Wi-Fi speaker that also functions as a smarthome control center, and acts as an assistant for your entire home. You can use it for managing daily routine tasks, ask for information, or use to it play music. It houses a speaker underneath the shell which allows you interact with Google Assistant. Google said we could expect the device to be released “later this year.” Hence, it is likely that we hear more about it on 4 October. Other products So what else does Google has in store for October 4th. If rumors are true, Google could also announce a Huawei-made 7-inch Pixel tablet. Even credible tipster Even Blass aka @evleaks tweeted that Google is indeed prepping a new tablet that’ll be built by Huawei. Could it be a genuine successor to the Nexus 7 (2013), we’ll find out more on October 4. Till then, hold onto your horses and stay tuned for more information.

Online voter registration searches surge in Latino areas Published September 29, 2016 Fox News Latino (Photo by David McNew/Getty Images) In what is being dubbed “The Alicia Machado Effect,” Google Trends indicated that the company has seen a surge in searches for voter registration over the last week, with a disproportionately large portion of those searches coming from largely Hispanic areas. By Wednesday night – two days after Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton name-checked Machado during the first presidential debate – all the areas that topped the list of voter registration searches were in heavily Latino markets in Texas, California, Nevada, Arizona and Florida.  And the trend appeared to be holding into Thursday. It’s unclear whether the plight of Machado – who was criticized by GOP nominee Donald Trump for gaining weight following her 1996 Miss Universe win and again on morning talk shows following this week’s debate – is driving more Latinos to register to vote. But the trend reported by Google marks a large reversal from last month's registration searches, which were highest in predominantly white, Northern states – areas that typically have the highest voter turnout in presidential elections. The Google search surge, however, does fit with anecdotal evidence that Trump’s language – not just toward Machado, but on topics important to Latinos such as immigration – is driving more Hispanics to register to vote this election season. “I’m confident Latino voter turnout will go up significantly,” Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julíán Castro told Fox News Latino during the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia. “We see it in the registrations that are happening in different states. I believe it can go into the 50s, and if that happens then particularly in swing states like Florida, Colorado Nevada and even Virginia, where there is a growing Latino population, Hillary Clinton will win those.” Latinos, however, have historically failed to show up in large numbers come Election Day. In the 2012 presidential match-up between Barack Obama and Mitt Romney, less than half (48 percent) of registered Latino voters cast a ballot – a figure that has remained relatively unchanged over the last four presidential elections. “Our weakness in this country is that in the past there have been Latinos who are eligible to vote who are not registered to vote,” said Democratic Rep. Linda Sanchez of California. “The only way we’re going to get the problems in our community addressed is to increase our numbers.” Like us on Facebook Follow us on Twitter & Instagram   Print   Email   Share   Comments Recommend Tweet Related Video Sen.

The company's X Lab, which was created to pursue big-vision projects, said it hopes to establish a network of helium balloons floating in the stratosphere that will emit a powerful 4G signal to rural and difficult-to-access areas. The new initiative -- launched in 2013 and dubbed "Project Loon" -- saw its first balloon take off from South America in February only to crash at a tea plantation in Sri Lanka, where it was discovered by villagers. Alphabet, the parent company of Google, had partnered with Sri Lanka to bring the internet to remote areas there. The country's Information and Communication Technology Agency, which coordinated the tests with Google, described the landing as controlled and scheduled. Loon has "significantly improved the balloon design, manufacture and launch procedure," X Lab told the UN's International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Wednesday, according to a document seen by AFP. "The balloons are now robust, remaining aloft well beyond the targeted 100 days, and are launched through a custom developed auto-launcher, allowing rapid multiple launches," X Lab told the organization's executive committee. After compiling publicly available wind data with its own flight data, Project Loon was able to model the stratosphere's air flow, allowing its balloons to "change altitude to 'catch' the winds moving at the speed and direction necessary to a given service area," the document said. Alphabet requested the assistance of ICAO member states as they met for its 39th triennial assembly, asking them in particular to "establish bilateral or multilateral letters of agreement with adjacent states and Project Loon to allow Loon balloons to safely transit flight information region boundaries." "Safety and coordination with the international civil aviation community is very important to Project Loon," a X Lab spokeswoman told AFP. Loon is currently working to finalize a safety plan and set up its operations center. In July, leading social network Facebook launched a similar attempt to bring internet access to remote areas via solar drones. - AFP Most Viewed TODAY LAST 7 Days LAST 30 Days Fire breaks out at Pattaya discotheque early Thursday...

Resend activation e-mail Risk Assessment / Security & Hacktivism iPhone exploit bounty surges to an eye-popping $1.5 million Zerodium triples price for iOS exploits, doubles Android bounties to $200,000. by Dan Goodin - Sep 29, 2016 11:30 pm UTC Login to bookmark 59 Antoine Taveneaux A controversial broker of security exploits is offering $1.5 million (£1.2 million) for attacks that work against fully patched iPhones and iPads, a bounty that's triple the size of its previous one. Zerodium also doubled, to $200,000, the amount it will pay for attacks that exploit previously unknown vulnerabilities in Google's competing Android operating system, and the group raised the amount for so-called zeroday exploits in Adobe's Flash media player to $80,000 from $50,000. After buying the working exploits, the company then sells them to government entities, which use them to spy on suspected criminals, terrorists, enemies, and other targets. Last year, Zerodium offered $1 million for iOS exploits, up to a total of $3 million. It dropped the price to $500,000 after receiving and paying for three qualifying submissions. On Thursday, Zerodium founder Chaouki Bekrar said the higher prices are a response to improvements the software makers—Apple and Google in particular—have devised that make their wares considerably harder to compromise. "Prices are directly linked to the difficulty of making a full chain of exploits, and we know that iOS 10 and Android 7 are both much harder to exploit than their previous versions," he told Ars. Asked why a string of iOS exploits commanded 7.5 times the price of a comparable one for Android he said: "That means that iOS 10 chain exploits are either 7.5 x harder than Android or the demand for iOS exploits is 7.5 x higher. The reality is a mix of both." Many pundits and reporters regularly compare the bounties offered by bug brokers to those paid by the developers, the latter of which are without exception only a small fraction of the former. Apple bounties, for instance, top out at $250,000, or a sixth of what Zerodium is offering. Google, meanwhile, pays a maximum of $38,000, or about 15 percent of Zerodium's top bounty. The pundits often point to the disparity as evidence that the companies' bug bounty programs are being outdone by the brokers. Those arguments, however, discount a key difference between the broker-sponsored bounties and bounties funded by the software developers. To qualify for a Zerodium bounty, the chain must generally work almost flawlessly to surreptitiously give an attacker complete control over the targeted device. In the parlance of hackers, that's called a weaponized exploit. It's not enough that a researcher provides only a rough outline of the vulnerabilities with a less-than-perfect proof-of-concept exploit. The bounties paid by Apple and Google, by contrast, are much less demanding, and as a result, they generally require less work. The comparisons also discount an important but less tangible compensation offered by developer-sponsored bounties. Many researchers are strongly opposed to bug brokers who sell their exploits to governments, many of which have little accountability and a history of abuse. (For a sense of the debate, see this Twitter thread.) In August, for example, researchers uncovered a highly weaponized chain of exploits that targeted iOS users in the wild. The attack, which was developed by a US-owned company that is estimated to have charged about $8 million for 300 licenses, was only discovered after it targeted a political dissident located in the United Arab Emirates. In fairness, Bekrar has said the iOS used in that case had no connection to Zerodium. Still, many researchers understandably have strong objections to Zerodium and its competitors, and these individuals don't want to play any role in government spying. Bekrar has defended his business by saying that governments have a legitimate need for zerodays to achieve national security goals and to catch and prosecute criminals. Another difference, at least when contrasting Apple with Zerodium, is that Apple's biggest bounties are largely reserved for vulnerabilities in the secure boot and secure enclave components that protect iOS users who have lost their devices or have them confiscated. Zerodium, by contrast, is most interested in remote iOS jailbreak exploits that target a Web browser or the OS kernel. Despite the differences, Zerodium's move significantly puts upward pressure on the already sky-high prices paid for high-severity vulnerability reports. It will also ensure that an ample supply of zeroday exploits remain in the wild, despite the non-trivial strides Apple, Google, and other software makers continue to make in security their products.

San Francisco District Court Judge William Alsup denied [PDF] Oracle's latest motion to have the case reheard, this time on grounds of misconduct on the part of Google's lawyers. The legal war, which has been tied up in various phases since 2010, was ultimately decided in Google's favor and has since been appealed by Oracle multiple times. In this latest effort, Oracle had accused Google's legal team of failing to disclose the Chocolate Factory's intent to develop tools to run Android on the desktop via the Android App Runtime for Chrome (ARC). This, Oracle charged, would have nullified Google's contention that its use of Java APIs was limited to mobile devices and could be considered fair use, as its code did not compete with Oracle's own software. Alsup, however, shot down that argument, denying Oracle's motion. The judge reasoned that Oracle and Google had agreed that in this specific case, the focus was only to be on the smartphone and tablet implementations of Android. "It may well be true that the use of the copyrighted APIs in ARC++ (or any other later use) will not qualify as a fair use, but that will not and does not mean that Google's argument on transformative use as to the original uses on trial (smartphones and tablets) was improper," the judge wrote. "That Oracle failed to detect the ARC++ documents in its possession had no consequence within the defined scope of our trial." Additionally, Alsup argues, Oracle is picking and choosing what important data in the case should be added and what should be omitted. He notes that while the ARC++ information could help Oracle's claim, another document left out of the original trial would have backed up Google's side of the story by showing that Oracle/Sun offered an open Java API years earlier. "Sun itself had given away Java (including all of the lines of code in suit) in 2008 via its open-source OpenJDK. In 2015, Google used OpenJDK to reimplement the Java APIs for the latest release of Android, which it called Nougat," Alsup pointed out. "Google wished to use this evidence under the fourth fair use factor to show that its infringement did no more market harm than Sun itself had already invited via its own OpenJDK release." Oracle and Google declined to comment on the ruling. ® Sponsored: Customer Identity and Access Management Tips and corrections 29 Comments More from The Register Oracle lawyers prevail in copyright case (No, not that, the other one) Rimini Street will have to foot $46m legal bill 4 Comments Microsoft lures top Linux exec from Oracle to Redmond Wim Coekaerts' hire another sign of open source push 92 Comments Oracle Java copyright war latest: Why Google's luck is about to run out Analysis Database giant claims web ads goliath tricked court, Android isn't just phones 58 Comments $10bn Oracle v Google copyright jury verdict: Google wins, Java APIs in Android are Fair Use Big Red tells us it immediately plans to appeal 117 Comments Oracle v Google: Big Red wants $9.3bn in Java copyright damages And the judge wants to ban lawyers from Googling jury members 59 Comments Oracle campaigns for third Android Java infringement trial Android on Chrome in the spotlight 30 Comments Whitepapers Data and Analytics Maturity Model and Business Impact How top performing enterprises use their IT investments to store, process, and use data to make more effective, real-time decisions.

The upcoming operating system update for wearables packs in a ton of new features such as Play Store for Android Wear, apps that can run independently on the watch as opposed to being tethered to a smartphone, an onscreen keyboard and new fitness apps. However, users will have to wait a bit longer since Google will not be rolling out 2.0 this year. The release has been pushed back to 2017. Note that only the developer preview version of Android Wear 2.0 is out at the moment. Google is extending the developer preview until early 2017, which is also the timeframe that the tech giant has set for the first smartwatches to receive the Android Wear 2.0 update. "We’ve gotten tons of great feedback from the developer community about Android Wear 2.0––thank you! We’ve decided to continue the preview program into early 2017, at which point the first watches will receive Android Wear 2.0," says Google in a blog post. Why Is The Release Delayed? The OS version is not yet ready for prime time. Google wants to iron out bugs and encourages its developer community to keep spotting more. Bear in mind that Android Wear 2.0 Developer Preview is only available on a couple of devices. One is the Huawei Watch and the other is the LTE-equipped LG Watch Urbane 2nd Edition. Both are running on the same processor, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 clocked at 1,200 MHz. LG, Huawei and Motorola made it clear that they will be releasing Android Wear devices for the remainder of 2016. The Wearable Market According to data gathered by the IDC, the demand for wearables has increased by more than 67 percent in the first quarter of 2016 compared to the previous year. Total shipment volumes reached 19.7 million units for Q1 2016, which is quite the jump from Q1 2015’s 11.8 million units. (Photo : Android Wear) Android Wear 2.0 will arrive in 2017.   "The good news is that the wearables market continues to mature and expand," says Ramon Llamas, research manager for IDC's Wearables team. "The wearables that we see today are several steps ahead of what we saw when this market began, increasingly taking their cues from form, function, and fashion.” The IDC data also shows that Fitbit dominates the wearable market and claims more than a quarter of it. It is followed by Xiaomi, Apple, Garmin, Samsung and BBK. Photo: Uncalno Tekno | Flickr  TAG SmartWatch, Android Wear 2.0, LG, Huawei, Google, Motorola © 2016 Tech Times, All rights reserved.

(Reuters/Peter Power) Share Written by Mike Murphy Obsession Messaging September 29, 2016 Whither Google? Today (Sept. 29), Google relaunched its enterprise software services as “G Suite” (presumably a play on the fact that the top-level of management at companies is referred to as the C-suite). It also announced that many of its products, including its Docs word processor, its Sheets spreadsheet program, and Google Calendar, would now be infused with “machine intelligence” derived from the same research that was used by Google to beat the best human player in the world at Go and translate text into any language in real time. But the rebrand also reflects a growing trend within Alphabet entities to remove “Google” from their names. While G Suite is still very much part of Google, it used to be called “Google for Work,” and there has been a move within the company to seemingly separate out the company’s efforts beyond its core products in advertising and search. Here are a few other examples that have popped up in the year since Google reorganized itself into Alphabet: [google] X ➡️ X Google’s “moonshot” lab gets its name from the algebraic command of “solve for X.” Since the Alphabet restructure, the lab dropped Google from its name, presumably in an effort to differentiate its research from the work done by Google on its core products. Google Life Sciences ➡️ Verily Like X, Verily dropped the “Google” and went a bit more cryptic with its new name. This is the Alphabet division concerning itself with research into disease. Google Ventures ➡️ GV Google’s venture capital arm slimmed down its name to just its initials, again suggesting a distance from Google’s core business, but hinting that the two are still linked. Google Ideas ➡️ Jigsaw The think-tank set up by Alphabet chairman Eric Schmidt and former US State Department staffer Jared Cohen to research technology and geopolitics went in an entirely new direction with its name. (Jigsaw is also the name of a British clothing company, but it’s unlikely the two entities will have much overlap.) And then there are other ventures that never had Google in their name in the first place, including: Calico Alphabet’s division that wants to figure out if we can live forever. Sidewalk Labs A company set up to turn cities into smart cities. Think filling your home with Internet of Thing devices, but at a city level. Nest Google’s smart-home device company that it purchased in 2014 for $3 billion. Android The company’s mobile operating system that it acquired in 2005 for $50 million.

Follow TechnoBuffalo Alto on Thursday introduced a new update that might make you jump ship from Google Inbox. The feature, coming to Android and iOS, is known as “Dashboard,” and is designed to organize your life into Google Now-like cards. What makes Alto such a tantalizing alternative to a traditional email app is how it sorts emails into stacks; there are categories for travel, photos, files, shopping, and personal. This helps strip out important information from your email into the Dashboard view, which is where you can quickly see upcoming events, flights, hotel reservations, and more. Separating the important stuff from the noise of your inbox keeps your life organized, all in beautiful, visually-pleasing cards. It’ll even surface relevant items when they’re needed, such as a boarding pass on the day of your flight. For folks who have busy schedules, Alto’s Dashboard is a great tool for keeping track of what’s going on. Alto isn’t the only app to use this approach to email but it’s certainly one of the most elegant. See it in action in the video below.

Variety Continue to Variety () SKIP AD Variety Editions: U.S Latino Global Asia Subscribe Today! Navigation Menu Film TV Digital Contenders Video Dirt Scene More Biz Music Legit Jobs Conferences Insight Archives Directory Choose Edition: U.S Latino Global Asia Russia | My Account Sign In Subscribe Home Digital News How Google Plans to Take Down Amazon’s Echo (EXCLUSIVE) Janko Roettgers Senior Silicon Valley Correspondent @jank0 15 Share This Article Email LinkedIn Print Pin It Tumblr Courtesy of Google September 29, 2016 | 03:19PM PT At its press event in San Francisco next week, Google is expected to not only unveil new flagship phones, but also officially launch Google Home, a Wifi-connected smart speaker that can be best described as Google’s answer to Amazon’s Echo — but it’s just a first step in an ambitious plan to battle Amazon for dominance in the home. Google has already started to talk to consumer electronics manufacturers about building other devices that will work just like Google Home, Variety has learned. Key to these efforts is another device that has been built by the same team as Google Home: Chromecast, and its music-loving sibling Chromecast Audio. How Casting Became A Trojan Horse Google revealed key details of this plan during a closed-door meeting with industry insiders about a month after publicly unveiling Google Home. The meeting was attended by around 50 participants, and held in Google’s Mountain View offices. It brought some of the biggest names of home audio together in one room. Some of the companies in attendance have already been working with Google by selling Wifi-enabled speakers powered by Google Cast, the same technology that’s behind Google’s popular Chromecast streaming adapter. Chromecast and Google Home do share some key technology, and Google now wants to use these existing relationships to get consumer electronics manufacturers to build their own versions of Google Home — smart speakers that are powered by Google’s cloud-based assistant. “Google Cast has become a Trojan horse,” said one of the attendees, who wasn’t authorized to speak on the record with Variety. This insider estimated that some of the companies that attended the meeting may be ready to unveil speakers with integrated microphones and a connection to Google’s assistant as early as next summer. Amazon’s Echo Is the Next Search Bar Google’s overtures to consumer electronics makers come at a time of upheaval for many home audio brands. Premium stereo equipment makers in particular have seen their sales diminished in recent years by both changing listening habits and a rapid evolution of technology. The move to streaming audio led music fans to massively embrace headphones and cheap Bluetooth speakers. Then Sonos came along and established itself as the market leader for premium Wifi-connected speakers. And finally, Amazon surprised everyone with the Echo, a device that redefined what a speaker does, thanks to smart voice control that can be used to request songs, news headlines, the weather, and even to order a pizza or an Uber. Amazon hasn’t released any official sales numbers for the Echo yet, but analysts peg the number of Echos sold north of 3 million. Reportedly, Amazon plans to sell as many as 10 million Echo devices next year. Home audio vendors are more than a bit concerned about this trend. So is Google, albeit for other reasons. To Google, the Echo isn’t just another speaker. It’s part of a bigger move away from text- and app-based interfaces that require users to seek out information to voice-based systems that offer more natural interaction. In other words: It’s what’s next after Google’s search bar — and it’s made by a competitor. Google Home Is Built for the Entire House That’s why Google developed Google Home, a small speaker with integrated microphones that responds to voice commands to play music and tap into Google-operated services for additional smarts. Google hasn’t actually given any live demonstrations of the product yet, but a product video shown at Google I/O in June showed users asking the speaker to query Google Calendar, send text messages to contacts, translate phrases, control connected light bulbs and more. The device is powered by Google Assistant: A smart, personalized assistant in the cloud that can respond to questions and commands, making use of the data Google has about its users. Related Here’s Why Google Home Is Much More Than Just an Amazon Echo Clone Google Home also integrates with Google Cast, the same technology that powers Google’s popular Chromecast streaming adapter. Consumers will be able to launch audio from their favorite Cast-compatible streaming apps on Google Home, including Spotify, Tunein, Pandora, NPR One, SoundCloud and more. At the same time, Google Home also works as a Cast sender, which means that it can launch media playback on other Cast-compatible devices. Consumers will, for example, be able to launch YouTube video playback on their TVs by telling Google Home what they want to watch. What’s more, Google Home can play music in sync with other Google Cast-capable speakers or Chromecast Audio-equipped stereo systems. The Battle for Your Bedroom Consumers who own an Echo often put that device in their kitchen, but Amazon has made some moves to take over their bedrooms, and the rest of the house, as well. The company recently introduced a slimmed-down version of the Echo called the Echo Dot, and is now trying to convince consumers that they need one of these devices for every room. At the same time, Amazon has started to collaborate with third-party consumer electronics brands to add Alexa technology to their devices. Amazon struck a deal with Sonos to leverage the Echo for voice control for existing Sonos speaker systems in August, and followed up this week with a similar deal with DTS for Wifi speakers powered by the company’s Play-Fi technology. And if that wasn’t enough, Amazon has also enabled a number of smaller manufacturers to add its Alexa smart assistant directly to their speaker systems. Google’s own negotiations with consumer electronics manufacturers could be hampered by what multiple sources have described as overly aggressive muscle-flexing. At the meeting in June, Google is said to have told home audio vendors that they won’t be allowed to add any other digital assistants than Google’s own to their hardware if they want to continue to use Google Cast. Another source told Variety of similarly far-reaching demands made in negotiations with another big consumer electronics manufacturer — demands that ultimately led to talks breaking down. (A Google spokesperson declined to comment on plans to add Google Assistant to third-party hardware, or on the meeting in question. She did however point out that some consumer electronics manufacturers have in the past used Google Cast in addition to competing technologies like AirPlay and Bluetooth.) In the end, Google’s plan to beat Amazon’s Echo may still hinge on the performance of Google Home. Multiple leaks suggest that Google will sell the device for $130, which is $50 less than the price of an Amazon Echo. If anything, Google has shown with the success of its $35 Chromecast that these price differences can matter. And perhaps, Chromecast really will act as a Trojan Horse for Google Home — and lay the foundation for a full-blown home invasion in 2017.

Ariella Waltman says: October 6, 2016 at 1:43 am They will become a monoply there needs to be a market place Reply Rob L. says: October 2, 2016 at 12:53 pm Why on Earth would you put something in your home that is designed to listen to you and everyone else in your home 24/7? That’s asinine. People cry foul over privacy invasions (as they should), but yet they VOLUNTARILY give up so much personal information to the likes of Google, Facebook, and Amazon that it’s almost unbelievable. Google is an advertising company — let’s all stop pretending they’re not. And they’re betting heavy on machine learning and AI — and to do that you need data. Lots and lots and lots of data. The best way to get that, evidently, is to get people to GIVE it to you freely, under the guise of connecting your toaster to your smartphone. This IoT stuff is an unmitigated DISASTER of enormous proportions just waiting to happen. I’ll have none of it. If you want to do this home automation stuff then learn how to work with microcontrollers and electronics and build them yourself — at least that way YOU are in control of what it does and where the data goes. Reply Ross says: October 3, 2016 at 4:35 am For some reason I can’t reply to your latest post so I’ll reply to this one. “Unless it’s an open hardware design and open source software you can’t actually know that it’s only listening for “OK Google” or whatever else.” The same argument could be made for any smart phone, or even any device cable of leaving a comment on here. If it’s got an internet connection, it could have a microphone spying on you. I’ve made a judgement on the likelihood of Google secretly gathering sensitive personal information beyond what I’ve consented to. I don’t think it’s very likely. That’s based on the difficulty of concealing such data gathering, the implications of them being discovered, and the value they would gain over the information I have consented to them gathering. Security of IoT devices is definitely a valid concern. As is single points of failure and continuation of service. In my opinion, privacy is less of a risk. Reply Ross says: October 3, 2016 at 1:39 am 99% of the time the only listening it will be doing is for the phrase “OK Google”. Only after detecting that will it begin to analyse what is being said in any more detail. My phone and watch already do the same. Yes, Google is an advertising company, and yes, they want big data. However, they do not and will not collect everything they are technically able to. If they started storing all of the raw audio from any of these microphones, they would soon be discovered and suffer a massive reputation cost. I trust Google. You might think that foolish, but it’s my considered choice and It’s impossible to function in modern society without trusting some corporations (Telecoms providers, banks, electronics manufacturers, etc.). If you choose not to trust Google, that is your choice, but don’t delude yourself that you aren’t trusting anyone. Personally I’m a big fan of home automation, although my toaster is a long way down the list of devices I’d like to connect. My home already has a fair bit of smarts and I did build a lot of it myself – down to soldering and coding in Python and C. I’m not your average consumer though. I’ve got a masters degree in electronics and software and develop embedded systems for a living. There are things that are not realistic for me to do myself though and advantages to off the shelf devices. It’s unrealistic and wasteful to expect everyone to build home automation systems from scratch. Reply Mike says: October 3, 2016 at 9:49 pm //Unless it’s an open hardware design and open source software you can’t actually know that it’s only listening for “OK Google” or whatever else// Actually it’s pretty easy to determine even if it’s encrypted, most network administrators have tools that allow them to see when data is transmitted to a device and how much data is transferred, for a smart speaker if large amounts of data are being uploaded when it isn’t being used then something is up. Bear in mind that the Amazon Echo has been out in the public for just a little under two years by now and bought by millions of people, if something was fishy, the planet would have noticed right now, instead we have same old conspiracy theories that have been propagated for years without any evidence to back it up. It’s doubtful that google would do anything untoward either, as they ought to know this whether or not the device is spying on users will be the very first thing tested. Also on the botnet thing, in order for someone to compromise an Echo, they’ll need to fully compromise Amazon Web Services first, which in and of itself would be a much bigger problem. Rob L. says: October 3, 2016 at 3:54 am Unless it’s an open hardware design and open source software you can’t actually know that it’s only listening for “OK Google” or whatever else. (and even if you can’t code, a big advantage of open source is that there are many eyes from people who CAN code on it as well) Some may call that paranoid, but Google gave up on their “don’t be evil” stance a long time ago, even if they don’t admit it. Of course you have to trust someone/something in your day-to-day lives, that’s just modern society, but there’s no need to voluntarily invite a single-point of failure like these devices into your own home. The consequences of them being compromised (and they will be, it’s only a matter of time) is too great, and it outweighs the advantages of the convenience they provide, in my opinion. [The ‘toaster’ thing I was being a little facetious, but my point still remains] It’s already happening – look at the recent events: in the last 10 or so days a MASSIVE “botnet” of compromised ‘Internet of Things’ devices (those stupid “smart” cameras, net-connected DVR boxes, etc.) was used to attack a major French ISP & server host farm (OVH) and a popular security researcher’s website (KrebsOnSecurity) which was protected by a major backbone internet provider (Akamai/Prolexic). This DDoS attack was the largest that anyone has ever seen. EVER! It was enough bandwidth to bring down almost anything. And it’s only going to get worse. These off-the-shelf ever-connected IoT things are a disaster in the making, and the idiot masses are actually PAYING for it out of their own wallets without even knowing it. If you’re too lazy, unwilling, or dumb to do a little bit of research or learn how something works then you deserve what you get — however, this will impact us all. Thomas Middleton says: October 2, 2016 at 2:05 am With options in devices and platforms like Asteria (getasteria.com) leapfrogging their efforts, I think they’re quite myopic in fighting one another in the battle for the home. Reply Steve Gallo says: October 1, 2016 at 12:56 pm Google & Amazon see this new product line and the future of home/AI/IoT . both will lose money on selling price and will pour huge amount of $ to build an eco-system. likely both will gain decent market share in 5 years from now Reply codecrackx15 says: September 30, 2016 at 11:28 am Google Home will be discontinued within a year. It’s the “Google Way”. Google has ADHD and can’t keep up with product lines. Nexus Player – Discontinued at the year mark Nexus 7 tablet – Last one was in 2013… people have been waiting since then. People have moved on to other tablets because Google sucks at keeping hardware lines going. Pixel 2 Chromebook – Discontinued. No other high end options at this time. 5 different messaging platforms… it’s insane. Possibly 3 different OS’s they will have. A list of hundreds of apps and utilities they have shut down after people started using them – Don’t get “Readered”. If you are interested in media and home automation… Go with Amazon and the Echo. They have a plan going forward. A plan they will stick with. Google is a mess right now. They are like Microsoft in 2006. Anything you use from them is buyer/user beware. Reply alexrmurf says: September 30, 2016 at 4:58 pm You have no idea what the hell you’re talking about. If you understand Google at all, Home is absolutely central to the future of their company. They’re betting everything on artificial intelligence and their big dream is to build the Star Trek computer, and they’re far better positioned to do that than any other company. And every other device you mentioned up there either has a newer version available directly from Google or from one of their hardware partners, which if you read the article, is the same approach they’re taking with Home and Cast. To think Amazon can compete with Google long term in machine learning and home automation is just silly. Reply codecrackx15 says: October 14, 2016 at 2:56 pm Like they did with Android TV? Google TV? Nexus? Android Gaming? To think you believe what Google tells you… now that’s just silly. George says: September 30, 2016 at 1:28 pm keep your facts straight: Nexus Player – received Android N update Nexus 7 – there is Nexus 9 and the Pixel Tablet, focus on “tablet” and not size of the tablet. Messaging – Hangouts, refocused for work, Allo, for social IM with Google Assistant 3 different OS – different OS for different devices, what’s the problem here? iOS, OSX? Amazon’s own OS was forked from Android, they should be grateful of Google. Reply codecrackx15 says: October 14, 2016 at 2:58 pm Nexus player has been discontinued. Getting Nougat doesn’t change that. Nexus 9 discontinued. Pixel is not a budget tablet nor even a good tablet. You people are such fanboys… blinded by adoration. Kent Smith says: September 29, 2016 at 11:04 pm It seems that Amazon is countering Google unit price competition by selling the Amazon Echo DOT for $49. The Echo Dot looks to be version 2 of the original Echo, with a design that encourages customers to purchase Amazon Dot 6 or 10 packs so they can have one in each room in the house,,,,,The Echo Dot does not require or need any previous Amazon Echo…..hmmmmmmm Reply wuzyoungoncetoo says: September 30, 2016 at 2:09 pm – “It seems that Amazon is countering Google unit price competition by selling the Amazon Echo DOT for $49.” And if you buy in the 6 or 12 packs the per-unit price drops to just under $41.66. – “The Echo Dot looks to be version 2 of the original Echo” Actually, the new $49.99 Dot is version 2 of the previous Dot (which sold for $89), which was itself an abbreviated version of the Echo aimed at a lower price-point.

Earlier this month, reports claimed LG, Lenovo, and Huawei aren't planning to release new Android Wear smartwatches in 2016, which seemed to imply they are in no hurry to put out new hardware, as consumer demand is reportedly not so demanding. Google was expected to unleash Android Wear 2.0 this autumn, but with no new smartwatches out to run it or even demo it, many wondered if that would affect the software's launch. The Mountain View, CA-based company has now confirmed the overhaul of its wearable OS won't officially release for smartwatches until early 2017. To soften that blow however, Google revealed that the new third developer preview includes the Google Play Store, meaning the software will eventually let you download apps directly to your watch instead of queuing them on your phone. So, with this Play Store integration, you'll be able to download paid titles and beta tests, browse recommended apps, and search for specific apps. You'll be able to download them without having to send them to your phone, too, as developers can now develop apps that live just on the watch. Beyond the Play Store, Android Wear 2.0, which Google announced at I/O 2016 in May, is a major update that'll bring a new user interface, widgets called "complications" for watch faces, a new keyboard for messaging, and more. Google neglected to provide a specific 2017 release date for Android Wear 2.0.

Aaron Agius Published 10:30 am, Friday, September 30, 2016 Photo: Ouh_desire / Shutterstock Image 1of/1 Caption Close Image 1 of 1 Photo: Ouh_desire / Shutterstock The Beginner's Guide to Launching a Mobile SEO Campaign 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Mobilegeddon was a game-changer. Google tweaked its algorithm in April 2015 to favor mobile-ready websites in searches performed on mobile devices. A little more than a year later, over half of all worldwide searches happen on mobile devices. It’s a big deal in marketing. If your site isn't mobile-friendly, you’re waving goodbye to more than half of your potential. Google wants to help with useful links and tools as well as guides designed specifically for content management systems (CMS). It’s good for you, and it’s good for Google. A mobile world. It’s hard to remember the world before smartphones. They’ve changed everything. According to Morgan Stanley, 91 percent of Americans keep their phones within reach 24/7. We use them all the time for what’s been dubbed “micro-moments,” those countless instances when we turn to our phones for information, directions, to do something, to buy something, to compare, to evaluate, to learn and more. Consider this: Search queries using “near me,” “close” or “nearby” have increased 34 times since 2011. Among smartphone users, 82 percent use a search engine when looking for local businesses. It must be a magic number: 82 percent of smartphone owners also consult their devices while shopping in a store. With apologies to Stanley Kramer, it’s a mobile, mobile, mobile, mobile world. Related: 15 Tips for Designing a Mobile-Friendly E-Commerce Site Talking about “mobile SEO" vs.“regular SEO" is a bit of a misnomer. It’s just SEO. They’re all cogs in the same machine. That said, if the thought of launching a “mobile SEO" campaign gives you nightmares, it's worth walking through the basics. Take these steps to avoid being penalized by search engines (you need their love) and begin targeting mobile users. Mobile-friendly is a must. Mobile-friendly simply means a site looks good and behaves properly on a mobile device. A mobile-friendly site can be designed in a number ways: Responsive. The site morphs depending on the size of the screen. Parallel-mobile. A second, independent site created for mobile users. Dynamic-serving. The server detects and loads an appropriate page depending on the user agent.   Each type of site has its pros and cons, but a responsive site is the easiest and most cost-effective to implement. It doesn’t hurt that it’s also Google’s official recommendation. You can accomplish this using a responsive theme, for which you’ll find free options and paid options, or a responsive plug-in. Your first step is to determine whether your website is, in fact, mobile-friendly. The mobile-friendly test from Google is straightforward. Enter your URL. Google's tool will tell if you're you're mobile-friendly and what you can do to improve your results if you don't pass muster. Related: How the Future of Mobile Search Is Unfolding This Year and Beyond Page speed matters. We know mobile friendliness is a ranking signal. So is site speed. Mobile users expect service on demand: 40 percent of surfers will abandon a site that takes longer than three seconds to load. Check your site’s speed using PageSpeed Insights. The guide presents both mobile and desktop results, letting you know which features are issue-free and helpfully suggesting which elements need serious attention. GTmetrix is another handy resource. Next, turn to the Google Search Console for tons of useful tools and advice. To tackle speed concerns, you’ll need to look into your Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) data. AMP is a stripped-down, faster HTML designed for mobile users. You can use Google AMP tools to see all pages that implement AMP, identify which of them contain errors and learn what you can do to fix those mistakes. Pages built using AMP load anywhere from 15 to 85 percent faster, but that’s only the start of the story. You can learn more at AMP Project (including tutorials for getting started). Just be aware it’s not for everyone or every site. It’s best for news-type sites such as blogs, and that’s in part because AMP doesn’t support opt-in forms. Adding AMP to Wordpress is reasonably uncomplicated, and sites using it will rank higher in mobile search-engine results pages (SERPs). Finally, explore Mobile Usability on the Google Search Console. It reports any existing errors, which might include flash usage, a font that’s too small or a viewport that isn’t configured. Any errors will affect your mobile SEO, so eliminate them wherever you can. Use Google My Business. One stop. Done. Want to be found when people search online? Google My Business gets your address, contact details and hours on both Google Search and Google Maps. You can edit it all from one convenient platform. Add photos, respond to reviews and shape how your business appears online. It’s easy. And crucial. Do it. Claim your business. Claim your business and check the details on local directories such as Yelp, Bing Places, Yellow Pages, CityGrid and Foursquare. These services are increasingly popular, and people use them to find local products and services. Bonus: They’re ranked favorably by the search engines. Follow the guidelines, and make sure everything is up-to-date. Google Maps may lead the way in mobile location-finding, but Apple Maps still is at the party. Don’t ignore it. Publish accurate information so people can find and contact you when they’re on the go. Track mobile stats on Google Analytics. Log in to Google Analytics and conduct some research on your mobile site visitors. Filter those results by day, time and device to discover exactly when your mobile customers are most active. Publish mobile-friendly content (more on that below) at those times to maximize your effect and reach. Create mobile-friendly content. Not all content is mobile-friendly, even when it’s on a mobile-friendly site. Focus on these tactics: Bullet points, which are easy to scan Short and concise text Easily shared articles and links Compressed images and videos that do not auto-play, so you benefit from faster load times and less data consumption Meta-title and meta descriptions that are short and to the point -- perfect for mobile displays Time of day is a factor here, too. Publish shorter content during morning and afternoon commutes and longer pieces during typical lunch breaks for your target market. Save your longest content for when people are likely to be at home. And remember, mobile users often look for informational content. Related: 5 Content Strategies That Will Always Work Use local keywords. When conducting keyword research, be sure include local vocabulary that might be unique to your area. Think about terms and slang that don’t appear anywhere else: nicknames for neighborhoods or the city itself, colorful and relevant expressions, regional specialties or whatever. When people search for you online, what language and words might they actually use? Target them. Optimize for voice search. People are talking to Siri or Google Now more than ever on their smartphones. In fact, 20 percent of Google searches on Android are now done via voice search. That amounts to hundreds of millions of inquiries, with 55 percent of teens and 41 percent of adults using voice search at least once per day. Voice search is the better option when walking (or driving -- which you shouldn’t do). But it does have its own set of criteria. Voice-search queries tend to be more conversational. We pose a question or ask our phones to perform a task in the same way we would talk to another human being. Craft your content to match those specific, real-life questions and optimize for the three biggest voice platforms. Related: Voice Search Is Exploding and Digital Strategy Will Never Be the Same Remember the takeaway. There’s a lot more you could do, but this is a great jumping-off point. It is the beginner’s guide, after all. If you take away only two things, these are it: Make sure you’re mobile friendly, and remember that page speed matters. Mobile optimization will get only more important. Don’t be left behind.

That means, taking something like a screen shot using the normal “power button + volume down” combo can be a little tricky. Okay, it’s downright frustrating. Thankfully, taking a screen shot on the LG V20 can also be quickly accessed in your device’s notification panel (look for the Capture+ button), which can also be moved around by clicking the edit button. Lastly, you can add a Capture+ button to your Second Screen by going into Settings > Second screen > Show when main screen on > Quick Tools. From there, you can tap an icon to replace with Capture+, or long press to rearrange. Use Quick Charge 3.0 chargers for the fastest charging The LG V20 is one of a few Android devices that features Qualcomm’s new Quick Charge 3.0 technology. Although you can can still (safely) use a wall charger from any other smartphone, to get the full benefit of Quick Charge 3.0 charging speeds from the V20, you’ll want to stick with the supplied charger that came in the box. The good news is that Quick Charge 3.0 is backwards compatible and although a Quick Charge 2.0 adapter may not charge the phone as quickly as the supplied charger, it’s better than most other non-QC (regular) chargers. If you’re looking for either a replacement or spare charger, here are a few reliable Quick Charge 3.0 adapters on Amazon: AUKEY Quick Charge 3.0 wall adapter: (Single port) $14 | (Double ports) $20 AUKEY Quick Charge 3.0 car charger (Dual port) $20 AUKEY Quick Charge 3.0 USB hub (6 ports) $35 Pop in a micro SD card The LG V20’s 64GB of internal storage should provide most folks with enough room to store their the apps, games, and media. But since the V20 also allows users to shoot in high-quality 4K (with HiFi Audio to boot), you may find it beneficial to expand this storage with a micro SD card. Especially if you plan on shooting a lot of video. Adding an SD card is easy. Just remove the back cover from the V20 by pressing the unlock button on the side and slide a micro SD card (up to 2TB) into the slot. Unlike the SIM card tray, you don’t even have to remove the battery to insert/remove an SD card, so you can use it to transfer media quickly and easily should you choose. When it comes to removing the SD card, make sure you eject it first by going into Settings > Storage > and tapping on the eject icon next to the SD card. After that, you can physically remove the SD card safely. Customize the Second Screen to make it truly useful Although some would label the Second Screen on the LG V20 a gimmick, it’s actually pretty darn handy once you set it up. There’s a ton of options here and while having a signature display your name all the time might be fun for some folks, it doesn’t really add much utility to the Second Screen. Instead, we found that adding our most commonly used apps, media controls, and settings toggles (Quick Tools), was the perfect way to take advantage of the Second Display. Here’s where you’ll find it. Open the Settings app Tap on Second screen From here, you’ll find 2 main options (Show when main screen on and off). Tapping on the words — not the toggle switch — will pull up additional options for the following: Show when main screen on – Choose additional content to show on the Second Screen from contacts, to upcoming plans, or recent apps. You can rearrange the order by using the handles on the left. Shown when main screen off – Choose whether to show the Date & time or your signature when the main screen is off. You can also choose which Quick Tools (settings toggles) to show as well by tapping on them or long pressing to change their placement. There’s even the option to set the Second Screen to turn off automatically on their own. Customize the quick settings in your notification panel Android’s quick settings (toggles) are easily one of its most useful features. You can further add to their convenience by customizing and reorganizing them to better suit your needs. Just pull down the notification shade, then once more to expand the settings toggles. It’s then you’ll find the option to edit the notification panel, remove, add, or just rearrange your current toggles however you like. Don’t forget there’s 2 pages of toggles, so swipe over to the right to see the rest. LG’s UX 5.0+ interface adds a few extra options as well. Tapping the 3-dot menu will allow you to add additional sliders for brightness and volume, or new buttons for screen and file sharing (although admittedly, we turn those off). Customize your Home screen The LG V20’s built-in Home screen allows you to customize it in a variety of different ways. Found in Settings > Home screen, there are 4 main options: Smart Bulletin – This is like LG’s version of Google Now which is a home screen page dedicated to Calendar, LG Health, QuickRemote, Evernote, Smart settings, and Music. Wallpaper – This is where you can change the wallpaper on your Home screen. Screen swipe effect – The transition effect you see when swiping through your Home screen pages. Allow Home screen looping – Jump back to the first Home screen page after swiping past the last. Don’t forget that you could always download a 3rd party launcher (Home screen) from the Google Play Store. Just remember to enable it, you’ll have to visit the same Home screen page in your Settings app to choose it. Set up your “Do not disturb” schedule Nobody likes being woken up by a random email or instant message in the middle of the night. Although you could manually silence your phone before bed, it’s just one more thing you have to remember doing before turning in for the night. Nobody wants that. The nice part about having a smartphone is it can perform specific functions automatically — like mute your smartphone during set “do not disturb” times. Oh, and so you don’t have to worry about missing an emergency call or text message, you can still allow phone calls from specific phone numbers or certain instances (like multiple phone calls from the same number). This can all be configured in the following settings: Open the Settings app Select Notifications Tap on Do not disturb From here, you have a variety of options to customize do not disturb to your liking. Like allowing calls based on a specific criteria (anyone in your contacts for instance), or just allowing calls from anyone who calls repeatedly within 15 minutes (this could be helpful if someone’s in trouble and has to use a stranger’s phone). Select priorities – Calls from: no one, everyone, contacts, favorites. Repeated calls – Second call from the same caller within 15 min is not silenced. Messages from: No one, everyone, contacts, favorites. Schedule – Set a weekly schedule for turning on Do not disturb. Available options include by day, time, priority only or total silence. Power saving modes (game battery saver) Most devices these days feature some sort of built-in power saving function. The LG V20 is no different, but trumps a lot of other devices in that it offers a little more than the usual power saving settings (disabling background data, CPU usage, dimming the display, etc..) with an additional setting called Game battery saver. The game battery saver allows you to pick specific games to tone down graphical quality (frame rate or resolution) to make things easier on your processor/GPU. By messing with these settings, the V20’s graphics processor doesn’t have to work as hard, saving you precious battery as a result. It’s pretty straight forward and handy for games where graphics performance isn’t really all that important (Pokémon GO for instance). Open the Settings app Scroll down and select Battery & power saving Tap on Game battery saver (the words, not the toggle switch) Choose desired optimization level Customize your navigation buttons and color Like most other manufacturers, LG likes to theme up Android with their own custom UI. The result are strange UI choices, like changing the normally black navigation bar (where you find the on-screen buttons) by making the background stark white. It’s odd and quite frankly a little too bright when using the phone in darker lighting situations. The good new is you can change this back to black easily, just as the good Lord intended. Here’s how: Open the Settings app Scroll down the select Display Tap on Home touch buttons From here, you have 3 different options that include: Choose different button combinations, or add new ones Change the nav bar color (white or black) Hide Home touch buttons for specific apps/games KnockON and Knock Code KnockON is one of LG’s better known features and one they’ve been adding to their devices for years now. That doesn’t mean it’s any less noteworthy. The feature allows you to wake the device from sleep simply by double tapping on the display, or use a secret combination of taps on different quadrants on the display to unlock. While KnockOn should already be enabled by default, if you find the feature getting in the way (activating when it’s not supposed to), it’s probably best to just turn it off via Settings > Display > KnockON. As for the the Knock Code feature — locking your device down by using a combination of well-placed taps — you can find that here: Open the Settings app Scroll down and select Lock screen Tap on Screen lock (Confirm password if you have one) Select Knock Code from the list of available screen locks Follow onscreen directions on setting it up Apply a dark theme As part of LG’s new UX 5.0+ custom Android user interface, they’re finally allowing users to customize the look of their device using full system wide themes. They’re available in LG’s special Theme store app and change the look of everything from the notification panel to the icons and settings toggles. Right now there aren’t too many of them available (2 built-in, and 1 to download), but we’re sure the number will grow over time. Even then there’s a pretty nice dark theme you can try right now. Just hop into Settings > Theme to get started. Change the display size for more screen real estate (or poor vision) The display on the LG V20 is incredible large. One of the first things we noticed when powering the device on for the first time was how blown up the UI appeared. Icons were ginormous, text was huge — it was a little much for our tastes, especially considering the size of the display. Whether you have good eyes and want to take advantage of that extra screen real estate to show more of everything, or you want to further enlarge text, icons, everything — it’s all possible thanks to a new feature in Android 7.0 Nougat. Here’s where you’ll find it: Open the Settings app Tap on Display Scroll down and select Display size Move the slider to the left or right to either shrink, or blow up the entire UI Activate Mini mode for easy one-hand use The LG V20’s 5.7-inch display might be a lot for some folks to handle. Although it’s easy to simply use two hands to reach everything on the screen, should there come a time when only one is free, you’ll need to take advantage of Mini mode. This shortcut shrinks the screen to a fraction of its size so that everything is easily reachable with one hand. To activate it, all you have to do is swipe the navigation bar shrink it down to the left or right corner. After that, the window can be dragged around, or enlarged by grabbing the upper left corner. Should you decide this feature isn’t for you (I’ve activated it on accident more than a few times), you can always disable it in Settings > Display > Mini view. Give your home screen an app drawer (or choose something else) Whether you’re looking to change your home screen to one with an app drawer, or try one of the many 3rd party apps available on the Google Play Store, this can all be done from inside the Settings app. Open the Settings app Tap on Home screen Select Home Choose between Home, EasyHome, Home & app drawer, or any other 3rd party home screen app you already have installed. Night mode (comfort view) After recent studies have shown that the using your smartphone at night can keep you from falling asleep quickly, blue-light filters have become the latest buzzy smartphone feature. Depending on the phone, they go by different names but they all do the same thing: filter out blue light on your phone’s display to create a warmer image (similar to indoor lighting or candle light). On the LG V20, it’s called “Comfort view” and you can actually adjust the intensity of the effect. Here’s where you’ll find Comfort view: Open the Settings app Tap on Comfort view (text, not the switch) Choose desired intensity level (will need to activate the switch first) Unfortunately, there’s no way to schedule set Comfort view times, but the toggle can be found in your notification panel to easy on/off. Keep in mind you can rearrange the placement of the quick settings by clicking the EDIT button and long pressing them to drag them around. Multi-window mode For multi-taskers who hate being limited to using one app at a time, the LG V20 is one of the few devices that allows you to open 2 separate apps side-by-side for simultaneous usage. It’s called Multi-window mode and it’s built into Android 7.0 Nougat. Thankfully, that just so happens to be what the LG V20 is running and enabling it is easy. Press the recents button Tap the double rectangle button at the top of an app preview window (this will set the app to the top window) On the bottom half of the screen, pick another recently used app to open another window Things you can do: Press the home button to select another app (bottom window) Drag the slider in the middle to shrink/extend the top window Dragging the slider all the way down will exit multi-window mode The problem with multi-window mode is not very many apps support it at the moment. In fact, it seems some of our favorites — Pokémon GO, for instance — are DOA. Don’t worry, there’s actually a way you can force compatibility with the new feature, all you have to do is dive into Android’s secret Developer options. Here’s how: Open the Settings app Scroll down and select About phone Tap Software info Scroll down and tap Build Number 7 times “You are now a developer” message will appear Go back into the main settings and you’ll see a new option: Developer options Then… Open Developer options Scroll down and select Force activities to be resizable Reboot Now you’ll be able to open any and all apps in multi-window mode. Well, unless they force close on you. You’re welcome. Google In Apps The LG V20 is one of the first Android devices to feature Google In Apps. This is basically a feature that allows you to perform personal searches, pulling up info from inside your apps. For instance, you could search for a friend’s name and pull up a message they recently sent you, email, Keep note you’re sharing, Instagram profile, or loads of other info stored inside your phone — from inside your apps. To get started, you can either perform a normal Google Search and once the results are displayed, scroll over to the In Apps tab at the top. That, or you can open the shortcut using the In Apps icon in your app drawer (much easier). Keep in mind that not every app is compatible with Google In Apps, but Google says they’re working on adding more. Since personal results happen entirely on your device, you don’t even need an internet connection for it to work and can customize which apps to pull info from via your Google settings. Here’s how: Open the Google app At the top left, tap Menu followed by > Settings > In Apps Check/uncheck an app to add/remove from search results Camera Tips & Tricks The LG V20 features some pretty fancy camera tech. With a dual lens system, users can switch between the regular 16MP camera or a super wide angle 8MP on the fly. The weird part is when you first open the camera app, that primary 16MP camera is actually cropped to 12MP, giving you the appearance of a wider 16:9 aspect ratio. Don’t be fooled. While it’s nice to see the viewfinder filling up the entire display, it’s basically chopping off the top and bottom. Why is LG forcing this on their users? Who knows, but you can get back all 16 megapixels by jumping into the camera settings and making one small change. Here’s how: Open the Camera app Tap on the camera settings (gear icon) Select Photo size > 4:3 (16MP) Use the primary 16MP camera whenever possible Also something to keep in mind that, while the secondary wide-angle lens can be fun to use, the quality is noticeably worse than the regular 16MP camera. Our advice is to use it sparingly and only in extremely well-lit environments like the outdoors where there’s plenty of light. Other than that, stick to the 16MP camera if possible. Enable HDR mode and leave it on HDR mode doesn’t have a quick access toggle, but we strongly recommend going into the camera settings and enabling it as it greatly improves the bright and dark areas of your photos. When it’s turned on, there’s a very slight delay when snapping photos, so it’s not well-suited for fast moving subjects. That means if you’re shooting the kids’ soccer game or the family pet running around the living room, turn it off (just don’t forget to turn it back on later). Take a photo using your voice You can also snap photos on the LG V20 by using your voice. Just enable the “Cheese shutter” and while the camera app is open, say “cheese,” “smile,” “whiskey,” “kimchi,” or “LG,” to take a pic without using your hands (extremely useful for taking selfies. The LG V20 has a variety of shooting modes that include: Auto – Standard shooting mode Panorama – Stitch together a large panoramic photo Slo-mo – Slow motion video (120fps 720p) Popout – Use both 16MP/8MP cameras at the same time Time-lapse – Record video for fast forward playback (opposite of slo-mo) Multi-view – Take a photo collage using all 3 cameras on the phone at the same time Snap – Stitches together multiple video clips (tap to record 3 second video, or touch and hold for up to 60 seconds) Use the fingerprint sensor for more than the lock screen The fingerprint sensor on the LG V20 is more than just a quick and easy way to keep your lock screen secure. You can also use the fingerprint sensor to make secured purchases via the Google Play Store, or even to lock down media in your Gallery or QuickMemo+. Whether you’re looking to register additional fingerprints on your device, or toggle Screen lock and Content lock functions, you can find them in Settings > Fingerprints & security > Fingerprints. To set up Content lock with different back up password or pattern (one different from your lock screen), you’ll find those options in Settings > Fingerprints & security > Content lock > Set lock. Because nobody likes typing their long (at least it should be really long) Google password every time they want to download a 99 cent app or game, you can also use your fingerprint to authorize purchases. Just open the Google Play app and use the slide out menu on the left to select Settings. From there, select Fingerprint authentication, enter your Google password (hopefully for the last time), and from here on out you can simply use your fingerprint to make all your purchases on Google Play. Keep guests locked to a single app using Screen Pin Your smartphone is full of sensitive information. So what happens when someone needs to use your phone to make a quick phone call or look something up online? You can either hand over your phone and stress out, or you rest easy by taking advantage of a core Android feature called Screen Pinning. It basically allows you to lock someone down to a specific app of your choosing, but first, you’ll have to enable it: Open the Settings app Select Fingerprints & security Scroll down and select Screen pin Turn it on by tapping on the toggle Also turn on “Pin with screen lock“ Once it’s been enabled, you’ll now be able to activate this feature whenever you need to by doing the following: Open the app (screen) you’d like to “pin” Use the overview button to open Recent apps Tap on the pushpin icon at the bottom right corner of the app preview Confirm “Pin this screen to only use this app?” by tapping PIN “Screen is pinned” message will confirm the app has been locked To unpin the screen/app, touch and hold back button until you’re taken back to the lock screen Unlock your phone as normal to get back to your home screen Keep your phone unlocked when it’s safely with you Smart Lock is a core Android feature that allows you to keep your device unlocked when it’s safe with you. How does your phone know this? Well, you can set it to remain unlocked when it detects movement from your body, when you’re in proximity of your home, connected to the Bluetooth stereo in your car, or your smartwatch. Located inside Settings app > Lock screen > Smart Lock (confirm password), you’ll find the following options: On-body detection: Set up device to stay unlocked while it’s on you Trusted places: Add location where device should be unlocked (your home, for instance) Trusted devices: Add device to keep this one unlocked when it’s nearby Trusted face: Set up facial recognition Trusted voice: Set up voice recognition Note: No matter which Smart Lock option you choose, if you don’t use your phone for 4 hours (or happen to reboot), you’ll still have to manually unlock the phone again with your fingerprint, password, or pattern. Add app shortcuts to the lock screen change the unlock animation If you’ve secured your lock screen with a fingerprint, you probably wont see it very often since as soon as you press the power button, it will verify your fingerprint and unlock your device. But should you find yourself taking advantage of Smart Lock (which keeps your phone unlocked when at home or connected to a trusted device), you can customize the lock screen in a variety of different ways by going into Settings > Lock screen. From there you’ll find the option to change the wallpaper, unlocking animation (Screen swipe effect), or even the shortcuts to apps that appear on the lock screen. We’d highly recommend adding Contact info for lost phone in case your phone ever goes missing and is found by someone. This way they’ll know how to contact you or a loved one. Lock or hide “sensitive” photos or videos with Content Lock When it comes to keeping prying eyes out of your phone, having a secure lock screen is great way to keep people out. But should you require an additional layer of security (perhaps your household has a no-lock policy), you can hide sensitive memo’s, photos, or videos using LG’s Content Lock feature. Here’s where you’ll find it: Open the Settings app Select Fingerprints & security Tap on Content Lock From here, you’ll have the option of setting up a different password or pattern for Content Lock files (and a backup PIN in case you forget it). If you want, you can also use your fingerprint by enabling it. To lock your files, you’ll need to open an album inside the Gallery app, press the 3-dot menu, then Lock. From there you’ll be able to select the files and then Lock at the bottom of the screen to hide them. Files that are locked wont appear in other apps, so don’t worry about them showing up somewhere else. Locked files can be viewed by opening the Gallery app > menu > Show locked files, where they’re organized according to the album where they originally came from. When Unlocking a file (long press or pressing the unlock button), the files will be moved right back into their original albums. Fairly straight forward. Automatically turn on/off settings with OpSmart Settings Smartphones are supposed to be getting smarter every year, so it’s nice when they actually live up that promise. Like lights, nobody likes remembering to turn off the WiFi off whenever they leave the house. Thankfully, the LG V20’s Smart settings can automate all most of these functions and more — you just need to set them up first. The first 2 main parameters to customize are at home and away from home which allow you to set a sound profile, and choose whether to turn Bluetooth or WiFi on/off when coming or leaving. This can be convenient if you like your phone to be set to silent when arriving home, or switching off WiFi before you head out on your morning commute. Then there’s when earphones are plugged in and when Bluetooth device is connected which simply allow you to set a specific app to open under those circumstances (launch Spotify for instance). It’s all pretty convenient and nice when your phone knows what you want to do without you even doing it. How to factory reset the LG V20 Should it ever come time to sell or send your LG V20 back for repairs, you’re going to want to erase all your data from the device. Also known as a factory reset, this will wipe the device clean to make sure none of your personal information is left — just as if it came fresh out of the box. Open the Settings app Scroll down and select Backup & reset Tap Factory data reset Tap RESET PHONE (confirm password) Check for new Software Updates manually There’s a good chance that, by the time you boot up the LG V20, there’s going to be some sort of software update waiting for you. Whether it’s a full system update or just one of those Android security patches, you should know how to check for an updates manually (instead of just waiting for them to arrive). Here’s where you’ll find the setting buried: Open the Settings app, then scroll down and select About phone > Update center > Software update > Check now for update. Be careful buying glass screen protectors With the LG V20, I had the pleasure of being one of the first people in the world to get to test the device early. This also means that, when it finally came time to buy the usual accessories online (cases, screen protectors), I was also the guinea pig. With the phone not yet widely available, most accessories are still unproven with little-to-no ratings to help make an informed purchase. When buying a glass screen protector for the phone, I simply opted for the best deal and what seemed to offer the most coverage, but you see — that’s where I royally messed up. The LG V20 has a screen that curves downward on the top of the bottom of the display, something I — nor the manufacturers of this glass screen protector — considered. A screen protector trying to cover most of the glass, including the Second Screen, will need to bend to accommodate, something glass isn’t really good at. The result is a glass screen protector that doesn’t properly adhere to the top and bottom of the display as you can see in the above photo. Browsing some more, it does appear that some glass screen protectors don’t cover the Second Screen or extend too low over the LG logo either. I’m sure those would work a lot better, but I think I’ll wait for more reviews to come out before I rush to buy. Our suggestion? Stick with the plastic film screen protector that already comes pre-installed on the phone. Well, at least for now. Speed up the LG V20 using secret Developer options Without question, the LG V20 is one of the fastest smartphones we’ve ever had the pleasure of using. But all those silky smooth animations only get in the way of you and wherever you’re trying to go. To speed things up and make the UI feel more snappy, you can increase the speed of the animations but you’ll first need to activate the LG V20’s hidden Developer options by following these steps: Open the Settings app Scroll down and select About phone Tap Software info Scroll down and tap Build Number 7 times “You are now a developer” message will appear Go back into the main settings and you’ll see a new option: Developer options Then… Open Developer options Scroll down select Window animation and choose .5x Select Transition animation and choose .5x Select Animator duration scale and choose .5x Once you’re all done, go back to the home screen and turn off the display using the power button. Wake your phone to enjoy a speedier, more kicky fast UI. Keep in mind that the setting is persistent, so you don’t have to worry about having to redo anything after a reboot or system update. Join the LG V20 community over at Android Forums We covered a lot of ground here, but we’re only just getting started. There’s always more to learn and sometimes the best place to do it is by chatting it up with others on Android Forums.com. There you’ll find other users and/or prospective buyers sharing their thoughts, experiences, or even concerns they have with the LG V20. It’s the best place to gain some knowledge and although there isn’t much chatter right now, feel free to start your own conversation to get things started: LG V20 forum.

The phone is the first to ship with Google's new Android Nougat software. Nougat offers plenty of time-saving features, plus a few to save money and perhaps even your life. The update will let you switch between apps more easily and do more without opening apps at all. New settings also let you choose which apps eat up cellular data in the background. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File) MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. — Nougat, Google’s latest update of its Android smartphone software, isn’t particularly flashy; you might not even notice what’s different about it at first. But it offers a number of practical time-saving features, plus a few that could save money — and perhaps even your life. You’ll be able to switch between apps more easily and do more without opening apps at all. New settings also let you block apps from eating up cellular data in the background. Nougat is starting to appear on phones, including new ones expected from Google next week. Some of these features may seem familiar because individual manufacturers such as Samsung and LG have built them on their own. But now they are officially part of Android, which means they should work with a greater range of apps and phones. Multitasking To switch apps in the past, you had to tap a small square at the bottom and scroll through your open apps. Now, just double tap that square to go directly to your most recently used app. Keep double tapping to toggle between them — for example, if you want to switch back and forth between email and map. Or just have both of them open at the same time, one on top of the other. Instead of double tapping that square, press and hold it until the app you have open moves to the top half of the screen. You then can choose another app for the bottom. But some apps won’t work properly — or at all — in split screen, at least until their makers update them to support the feature. Going appless Nougat will let you reply to messages directly from a notification; for chats, you also can see recent sent and received messages from both sides, not just the most recent incoming note. And when apps such as Gmail group multiple notifications into one, just slide down the notification center from the top to see more on each item, rather than an unhelpful “5 new messages.” Coming soon is a feature called Instant Apps. You no longer need to download and install an app you might use just once. Instant Apps run on Google’s servers instead of your phone, and only the parts you need get sent to your phone temporarily. Though it’s not formally part of Nougat, it is part of Google’s effort to reduce app clutter. Save money … A data-saver feature blocks apps from using cellular data while running in the background. Google says that even if an app is active, images and other data-hungry elements might not load until you tap them. You still can choose to have specific apps override that — for example, if you absolutely must have your Facebook app check for updates around the clock. Even if you have a generous data plan, this feature is still useful when traveling abroad, where data charges get expensive. You can turn data saver on in the settings. … and perhaps your life Enter your name, blood type, allergies, emergency contacts and other crucial data in the settings. Emergency personnel can access the information by tapping “emergency” from the lock screen; they don’t need your passcode. Personalization To control what notifications you receive, just tap and hold a notification. You can choose to block notifications from that app or silence them as they come in. Or prioritize them by having notifications still appear when you set “Do Not Disturb” to “Priority only.” (This option still requires going to the settings, but it’s just one tap away from the notification.) You also have more control over the quick-settings menu, which you get by sliding down from the top edge twice (the first slide just yields five frequently used settings icons above your notifications). This menu gives you quick access to settings and tools such as Wi-Fi, flashlight and battery indicator. Hit “Edit” to add or remove some. Not every setting is available as a shortcut, though. How to get Nougat You’re in luck if you have one of Google’s recent Nexus phones, as Nougat is already available. LG’s new V20 phone ships with Nougat, starting this week in South Korea, while new phones expected from Google next week also should come with it. As is typical in the Android world, some phones might not have all of the new features, and some features might work differently. Everyone else should expect to wait a while. Android updates have to get tweaked and approved by both phone manufacturers and wireless carriers. Because of the time it takes, older phones might never get the update, even if the phone meets all the minimum technical requirements. Anick Jesdanun reports for The Associated Press.

This actually isn’t the first time the platform is being rebranded — you may recall it used to be called Google Apps for Your Domain a few years back. Obviously, a rose by any other name would smell as sweet, but it’s possible Google may be targeting a wider audience by deemphasizing the ‘work’ aspect from the name.

Discussing the rebranded Google Cloud, Diane Greene, senior vice-president of Google's enterprise business, said the company has made good progress courting customers and improving its technology. Cloud computing uses remote internet servers to store, manage and process data, and Google offers a range of apps like word processing and email, as well as the ability to host data and offer resources for developers. The new name replaces the Google for Work brand. "We are closing the gap incredibly fast" with competitors, Greene, a former CEO of VMware who joined Google last year to ramp up its cloud business, told experts and journalists at an event. Analysts say Google trails Amazon and Microsoft in market share but is gaining under Greene. Although the business is not big enough to break out separately in its quarterly earnings statement, Google reported a 33 per cent surge in "other revenue" in its most recent quarter, which analysts said was probably due largely to gains in cloud computing. Greene has moved quickly to streamline engineering and appointed new leadership to beef up the company's cloud business. This has helped improve sales, Google Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai said during the company's latest earnings call. Earlier this month, Google acquired cloud software company Apigee Corp in a deal valued at about $625 million. The company on Thursday also announced a partnership with consultant Accenture to develop cloud services for clients in industries such a retail, healthcare and finance. In addition, the company said it had woven more artificial intelligence into its apps to help employees work more efficiently. Using machine learning to crunch troves of data, Google says its apps will prompt users to, say, open files at certain times of day or propose meetings based on their habits. Google recently added a US data centre in Oregon in order to speed up service and next year will open more in Virginia, Mumbai, Singapore, Sydney, São Paulo, London, Finland and Frankfurt.

Business Home LBoard Arrests of Red Shirts imminent, says Guan Eng Predeep Nambiar Read More FMT BAHASA FMT BORNEO+ FMT VIDEO CONTRIBUTE NEWS HOME NATION OPINION WORLD LEISURE SPORTS BUSINESS ADVERTISE WITH US BlackBerry lesson: Adapt or die in the internet Age AFP | September 30, 2016 The tech sector is young and fast-moving in an internet culture that praises "disruption" and "revolution" of industries and lifestyles. SAN FRANCISCO: BlackBerry has joined Yahoo, Nokia and other technology industry stars felled by an internet age in which companies are forced to evolve quickly or perish. Canadian-based BlackBerry announced Wednesday it would halt in-house production of smartphones, marking the end of an era for the once-dominant handset producer. Originally known as Research in Motion, the company earned a dedicated following of “CrackBerry” addicts and introduced millions to the smartphone. But, its luster faded with the introduction of the iPhone in 2007 and the large number of low-costs Android handsets that followed. BlackBerry travelled a road well-worn. Finland’s Nokia, once the world’s largest mobile phone maker, has seen its smartphone business go up in smoke as well. Internet pioneer Yahoo recently inked a deal to sell its core business to US telecommunications firm Verizon after years of struggling in vain to revive growth in an online search market usurped by Google. “What they have in common is that they haven’t reacted well to rapid change from their original positions,” said Endpoint Technologies Associates analyst Roger Kay. “Tech has high velocity.” The tech sector is young and fast-moving in an internet culture that praises “disruption” and “revolution” of industries and lifestyles. Among mottos found on the walls of leading social network Facebook is “Move fast and break things.” Smartphones themselves have become seemingly indispensible, with people typically replacing handsets every year or two in order to have the newest features or capabilities. Resting on laurels Changing to capitalize on a new trend can be daunting for companies comfortable with products that keep revenue flowing for the moment. “It reminds me of all those old singers going to Las Vegas to do whatever it is they do when they should really have just stopped,” Kay said of tech companies sticking with what early hits. “Everybody wants to do an encore and get paid again.” When Apple launched the iPhone in 2007, some critiques questioned why the California company was “cannibalizing” its successful line of iPods. The iPhone became a global sensation, and a main driver of stellar profit for Apple. Kay noted that when Yahoo ruled internet search it became clear their model was under attack by a newcomer called Google. Yahoo may not have seen the threat, or may have blinded itself to the need for change because its old business model continued to pump revenue, according to Kay. And while there are individual specifics underlying the downfall of incumbent mobile phone titans, they all faced the sudden and simultaneous rise of two powerhouses Apple disrupted smartphones and lifestyles with its iPhone, and Google fired back with an Android mobile operating system that any consumer electronics maker was free to use. The Google and Apple one-two punch was enough to essentially “pivot” a smartphone market that incumbents thought was too stable to rattle, according to independent Silicon Valley analyst Rob Enderle. “None of the big firms were prepared to deal with it,” Enderle said of two companies new to the smartphone scene fueling a revolution. Unlike the birth of search engine Google on a young and growing internet, mobile phones were an existing market that incumbents felt they knew well and were “completely taken aback b the combination of Apple and Google,” according to Enderle. Reinvention Veteran technology firms being overtaken by newcomers is not necessarily inevitable, if established companies have the wit and courage to re-invent themselves, adapting to survive. Analyst Kay noted IBM, a century-old technology company that has embraced transformation time and again, even shedding products along the way. Computer chip giant Intel shifted its focus to microprocessors for mobile devices to adapt to how internet-connected devices were evolving. Apple itself was a computer company on the brink of bankruptcy when it staked its future on iPods and iPhones in a winning move that made it one of the most profitable companies on the planet. The future is a question mark for Microsoft, once the world’s largest company, which has fallen behind Apple and Google as the PC industry declines and which is refocusing on enterprise services. But reinvention isn’t a cure-all, and needs ongoing commitment to change along with vision of where markets are heading. IBM now seems tangled in endless restructuring, with revenue declining for more than four years; Intel continues to struggle to find the kind of success it had with big computer chips. Analysts have taken to wondering whether Apple itself has become too dependent on the iPhone, and is taking too long to come up with “the next big thing.” Comments Readers are required to have a valid Facebook account to comment on this story.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us View the greens at the Ryder Cup through Google Street View By Ida Torres - September 29, 2016 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter For fans of golf, one of the most anticipated tournaments is the Ryder Cup, a biennial competition between teams from Europe and the US. This year, it will be held from September 30 to October 2 at the Hazeltine National Golf Club in Chaska, Minnesota. Of course you can catch the tournament on your sports channels, but in case you’d want to walk where your heroes walk, you will now be able to virtually do so through Google Street View. Turner Sports wanted to change the way fans experienced the Ryder Cup this year, especially those who won’t actually be able to make it to the Minneapolis. And so Google brought them the Street View Trekker which allowed a team to collect hole-by-hole imagery which is then uploaded to Google’s database. Golf fans will now be able to walk through the same greens that the team will be walking through if they go to Google Maps. There is also another way they can enjoy that view and have a deeper understanding of the tournament. The Hazeltine Explorer is an interactive tour from Turner Sports. You’ll get 360-degree views, custom elevation graphs for each of the holes, integrated video highlights from past and the present tournament, and course-specific historical moments from the Ryder Cup. This app was actually built using Google Maps API. For those who’ll be able to go to the tournament, you can also use the Ryder Cup app’s Wayfinding feature to look at the detailed view of the entire course, plus routing instructions, on-course amenities and facilities, etc. You can download the Ryder Cup app from the Google Play Store for free.

The decision combines Google for Work, Google’s Cloud Platform, which Google said has more than 1 billion users, and the company’s other cloud-based services to bring smart data, analytics, machine learning and digital communications to companies of all sizes in the next five years. Google’s Diane Greene, senior vice president of enterprise business, told an invitation-only gathering at its Horizon cloud computing conference in San Francisco the company considered the name Google Enterprise to convince customers it is serious about cloud computing — using a network of remote services hosted on the internet to store, manage and process data, replacing a local server or personal computer — TechCrunch reported. It ultimately decided Google Enterprise is too unwieldy and not descriptive enough, she said. “Enterprise — that was so June,” Greene said. “We are the full power of Google in the Cloud. We are Google Cloud. It’s uniquely Google — a broad set of technologies, solutions and products.” Greene, a former CEO of VMware, said Google is closing the gap with competitors rapidly though it still trails Amazon and Microsoft on market share. Google reported a 33 percent surge in “other revenue” in the most recent quarter and analysts attributed that to gains in cloud computing, Reuters reported. Google acquired Apigee Corp., a cloud software company, for $625 million earlier this month.

This comes more than two months after the second preview went out. The new software meant for developers to test brings with it a huge new feature - the Google Play Store, on your wrist. From this point on, you no longer have to use your phone to put apps on your watch. The Play Store for Android Wear lets you easily find and install apps straight on your wearable. According to Google, this will help developers of Android Wear apps reach more people. The Play Store for Android wear starts up with a home view filled with recommended apps, and you can search for others using voice, keyboard, handwriting, and recommended queries. This makes finding an app as easy as possible on such a small device. You can switch between multiple Google accounts, as well as take part in alpha and beta tests, just like you can on Android itself. There's even a My Apps view in the Play Store on your watch, where you can manage what's installed. This release finally decouples watch apps from phone apps, so if you want a specific app on your wearable but not on your handset, that's now possible to have. And, obviously, developers can start making watch-only apps from now on. Complications improvements have been baked into the third developer preview of Android Wear 2.0 too, and inline actions are possible for notifications. Finally, smart replies are going to be available for messaging style notifications. The bad news is that Google is not sticking to the initially announced "fall 2016" release time frame for the final version of Android Wear 2.0. This has now been pushed to "early 2017", and a fourth developer preview is going to arrive before that. Given the huge changes coming to the wearable OS, it's probably best if the final release isn't plagued by any showstopping bugs; on the other hand, delays of any kind naturally aren't nice, and Wear 2.0 has already been in development for at least five months.

Credit: Gage Skidmore More like this In three debates, H-1B visa untouched by Clinton and Trump The H-1B positions of Clinton and Trump Trump to Russian hackers: Help find Hillary Clinton's emails Video Inside Google's Loon and Wing Just two days after his first debate with Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump told an audience at a political rally in Wisconsin that Google is biased against him and suppressing search results. After saying that a new Google "poll" showed him leading Democratic nominee Clinton, he went on to accuse the market's most dominant search engine of working against him. Google itself did not run a poll after the debate. Instead, the Independent Journal Review commissioned a poll using Google Consumer Surveys data. That poll showed Trump was leading Clinton nationally by 1.7%, but that Clinton won the debate by 4 percentage points. "A new post-debate poll that just came out, the Google poll, has us leading Hillary Clinton by two points nationwide and that's despite the fact that the Google search engine was suppressing the bad news about Hillary Clinton," Trump said Wednesday night at a rally in Waukesha County, Wisconsin. The Republican presidential nominee did not offer any examples of Google changing its search results in connection with Trump or Clinton. The Trump campaign had not responded to a request for comment at deadline. Google declined to comment on Trump's statements. However, in August 2015, Amit Singhal, a senior vice president for Google, wrote in a piece on Politico.com that Google does not work to influence political elections. "Google has never ever re-ranked search results on any topic (including elections) to manipulate user sentiment," Singhal wrote a year ago. "Moreover, we do not make any ranking tweaks that are specific to elections or political candidates. From the beginning, our approach to search has been to provide the most relevant answers and results to our users, and it would undermine people's trust in our results, and our company, if we were to change course." In July, The Washington Post posted research showing that Trump prominently appeared on the Google News homepage about twice as often as Clinton did. Patrick Moorhead, an analyst with Moor Insights & Strategy, said it's "highly unlikely" that Google is adjusting its search engine to benefit one candidate over another. "Trump didn't do very well at the debate, and therefore he needs to blame the aftermath on something," he said. "He's going after Google as he doesn't like what he sees on search." Going after a search engine doesn't make a whole lot of sense, Moorhead continued. "Google search is very algorithmic, with very few people managing these things," he said. "The misconception is that there are a lot of humans involved behind the curtain at search." While it's technically possible for Google to tweak its search algorithms, doing so could hurt the business and its dominant share of the search marketplace. However, that doesn't mean that an allegation, even one not backed up with evidence, won't harm a company. "It very difficult for companies to have a clean reputation with charges and counter charges always flying," said Jeff Kagan, an independent industry analyst. "I don't know whether there is a problem at Google or not, but the charge will hurt them. Charges like this always do."

About Future Staff Contact Privacy Policy Search for: Select Press Releases Home / Press Releases / Serpstat Launches a Tool for Finding SEO-Friendly Topics and Headlines Now Serpstat Launches a Tool for Finding SEO-Friendly Topics and Headlines Now Posted on September 29, 2016 by Benzinga Full Feed in Press Releases Conceptual image of a businessman holding big hammer Find out questions that people might have about your product with a new tool from Serpstat (PRWEB) September 29, 2016 Serpstat is a growing Ukrainian startup that provides search analytics data for SEO, PPC and marketing specialists. By continuously collecting and saving the data from search engines, Serpstat’s staff is able to create algorithms that allow its users to conduct a keyword research, analyze competitors in organic and paid search and etc, monitor positions and market shares and etc. Data that Serpstat collects from Google includes the so-called autocomplete suggestions. Autocomplete suggestions, or search suggestions, is a feature that allows Google to predict the rest of a search query that a user is typing. Or in other words, it’s what users see under the Google’s search bar as they type in their search request. A brief description of this feature written by Google can be found here. Serpstat’s Search Suggestions tool can collect this data in real time and show what suggestions are most likely to be shown by Google for any keyword at given time. It also shows previously used suggestions and suggestions for keyword combinations that are most common for a given research subject. By typing any keyword into this tool users will get a list of potential autocomplete suggestions. Serpstat can also filter the results to show only questions, so for example when user enters a keyword “dog food” into this tool, he or she will get a list of the most common questions about the dog food according to Google. Like, “How to make a dog food soft?” or “What dog food is bad for dogs?”. Questions like these can be used as Ideas for a blog’s content and as titles for website’s pages. From the SEO point of view these questions work great because competition for keywords as specific as “how to make an automatic dog food dispenser” usually have low competition. These questions are suggested by Google to people who search for related things and they are also an exact match to the query in cases when people follow Google’s suggestion. Serpstat claims that their search suggestions tool is the most accurate and has the biggest database. This tool is completely free to use within Serpstat’s otherwise subscription-based tool for SEO, PPC and Marketing specialists. Apart from just providing a list of autocomplete suggestions, this tool shows what words are most commonly used in combination with the request and how big are the different question groups. To use this feature simply follow this link. For more information about Autocomplete Suggestions Tool by Serpstat, contact Eugene Lata at e.lata(at)serpstat(dot)com.

The right question is why you shouldn’t use it. – tchrist♦ Dec 17 '14 at 5:18 1   I've yet to see a dictionary say of a specific white-space-bounded letter string 'there is no such word'. The latest estimates of the number of words in the English lexicon are over 1 000 000, and the most comprehensive English dictionary addresses fewer than half of these. – Edwin Ashworth Dec 17 '14 at 6:39 add a comment |  5 Answers 5 active oldest votes up vote 5 down vote Whether a word can be said to "exist" or not is a very difficult question whose answer depends on many things. Clearly, for example, the sequence of characters comprising "incrementation" exists or otherwise you couldn't have written it down in the first place! So, instead, I will answer an easier and less philosophical question: are there a number of uses of "incrementation" in the wild with the meaning you suggested? The answer is decidedly yes. Now, whether that's a good choice, of course, is something else entirely. Some people might say "incrementation" is too technical or constructivist of a word for regular, everyday usage. In that case, you should stick with just "increments" or "incrementing" instead of using the less common word. share|improve this answer edited Dec 17 '14 at 5:26 answered Dec 17 '14 at 5:04 John Feminella 1,650719      I'd say it's a matter of agreeing terms (and perhaps the collection and analysis of corpus data) rather than being 'philosophical' (unless you're using an uncommon sense). 'Academic' certainly, in both the 'debated by academic institutions, rather than being a problem the man on the Clapham omnibus worries about' and 'not practically achievable' senses. – Edwin Ashworth Dec 17 '14 at 6:37      The philosophical question is "Do words exist by the fact that they can be constructed from letters, or by common cultural agreement, or by appeal to authority, or by ability to convey meaning?" – Timbo Oct 21 '15 at 18:55      It's exactly the kind of question pondered by Analytical Philosophers in the early 20th century. – Timbo Oct 21 '15 at 20:32 add a comment |  up vote 2 down vote There are about 358,000 Google hits for "incrementation" (with upright quotes, to limit searches to pages with this exact word), so it surely exists as a word in actual usage—even though Google results are not an exact measure of anything and even though there are probably occurrences of the word in languages other than English, too. The word “incrementation” appears to be used mostly in programming, mathematics, and natural sciences. For example, in some programming languages, according to established terminology for them, “the incrementation operator” means the “++” operator, which increments the value of its argument by one. There is apparent need for a word like “incrementation”. Even though we could say “the incrementing operator”, it’s not really a term-like expression, and when we need to discuss how the process of incrementing something actually happens, “incrementation” is more convenient and readable than “process of incrementing”. Dictionaries like Merriam-Webster and Oxford dictionaries do not contain it, but they often lack new words and words with limited scope of use. This particular word might be common enough to make its way to dictionaries, but this is not automatic; their editors need to do things, and they also exercise their judgment. Dictionaries also have normative aspects: words may be excluded since they are considered as “not correct” in some sense. Spelling dictionaries like those used by Microsoft Word tend to be more limited than large general dictionaries, since when a word is rare, its occurrence in text may well be unintentional, a “typo” or other mistake, so it is useful to inform the user about a potential problem. share|improve this answer answered Dec 17 '14 at 6:49 Jukka K. Korpela 1866      OED is an 'Oxford dictionary'; are you saying that OED doesn't list 'incrementation'? – Edwin Ashworth Dec 17 '14 at 11:53      @EdwinAshworth, I was referring specifically to the dictionaries at the oxforddictionaries.com site. – Jukka K. Korpela Dec 17 '14 at 12:48      You cannot just search Google in general. You need to search Google Books specifically. – tchrist♦ Dec 17 '14 at 17:43 1   @tchrist, I actually did, and there is nothing you can do to stop me from doing it again! Searching Google Books might answer the question “Is this word used in printed books, more exactly those available as scanned at Google Books?” Interesting as that might be, it’s a different question. – Jukka K. Korpela Dec 17 '14 at 18:02 add a comment |  up vote 1 down vote It's common in computer science to turn verbs into nouns simply because labelling processes is at the heart of what we do. The verb for this is to reify (or to objectify), which itself has the noun form, reification. Incrementation isn't a pretty word. Stylistically, I'd prefer to use increment as an adjective, 'the increment operator', or using 'incrementing' as a noun, where possible, but I certainly agree there are places where such a word could be valuable. Is it a word or isn't it? There's no formal way to say, because there's no definitive source in English for what is a word and what isn't. Consider that many programming terms don't mean what their general English equivalents mean. Many terms don't appear in dictionaries at all. It's understandable and it communicates a familiar idea. If you ask me, yes, it's a word. share|improve this answer answered Jan 25 '15 at 15:41 Paul Senzee 37516      As an old (in more ways than one) computer guy, I'd generally try to make do with "incrementing". "Incrementation" is simply too hard to read, if nothing else (did that say "incineration"? "incremation"? "incrimination"?). Google, for instance, for how many times it was misspelled "incrematation". – Hot Licks Jan 25 '15 at 20:26 add a comment |  up vote 0 down vote Yes. It means the act of incrementing: Incrementation of the counter occurs once a second. It could also mean the result of incrementing, though I doubt that that meaning is used often. share|improve this answer answered Dec 17 '14 at 5:13 Drew 9,25151941      Ick! You mean the counter increments every second, or incrementing the counter every second. The other smacks of gratuitous and tasteless nominalizationifying. – tchrist♦ Dec 17 '14 at 5:17 1   @tchrist: Why would it be any different from implementing and implementation? Implementation of a new version of program FooBar happens every summer during the Google Summer Of Code. You might prefer to say Joe implements... or Implementing a new version...happens... but the first is quite possible, regardless of what it might smack. – Drew Dec 17 '14 at 5:28 2   It’s different because you have the noun an increment for what happens when you increment something, but when you implement something, you don’t end up having an *implement. That’s why. – tchrist♦ Dec 17 '14 at 5:30 1   It is expected that answers be supported by authoritative references, or at the very least, a reasonable number of examples. If this is not the case, how can readers judge how subjective the answer is? – Edwin Ashworth Dec 17 '14 at 6:19 1   One man's gratuitous and tasteless nominalizationifying is another man's useful word formation. Some might feel 'increment' is overworked: increment n. 1. The process of increasing in number, size, quantity, or extent. 2. Something added or gained: a force swelled by increments from allied armies. 3. A slight, often barely perceptible augmentation. 4. One of a series of regular additions or contributions... 5. Mathematics A small positive or negative change in the value of a variable. [AHDEL; I'd say sense (1) wasn't the most commonly used. 'Incrementation' strongly suggests the process.] – Edwin Ashworth Dec 17 '14 at 6:29  |  show 2 more comments up vote 0 down vote Although the word incrementation has been seen in print, it occurs only incredibly rarely according to this Google N-gram: To control for verb use instead of noun use, I’ve put an in front of the singular noun and of after the plural one. As you see, there is a frequency difference of 3 to 4 orders of magnitude. Moreover, if you look at actual specimens, you will find that most of them could have been far more felicitously worded had a different word been chosen. I wouldn’t use it, but whether you choose to use this rare word this is entirely up to you. share|improve this answer answered Dec 17 '14 at 17:51 tchrist♦ 85.3k20208341      So? You have excluded occurences that are not preceded by an indefinite article. This is rather arbitrary. – Jukka K. Korpela Dec 17 '14 at 18:01      @JukkaK.Korpela Do you have a better suggestions for isolating noun uses from verb uses of increment and increments? I did the same to both, so it should not matter. – tchrist♦ Dec 17 '14 at 18:55 1   The question was “Does the word ‘incrementation’ exist?” I see no reason to distinguish between forms of some other words. I was pointing out that you restricted searches for “incrementation” to occurrences preceded by an indefinite article. – Jukka K.

Google rebrands its business apps as G Suite, upgrades apps & announces Team Drive Posted Sep 29, 2016 by Sarah Perez (@sarahintampa), Frederic Lardinois (@fredericl) 0 SHARES Next Story Tales from a Tesla Model S at 200k miles Google announced today that its now ten-year old service Google Apps for Work (formerly Google Apps for Your Domain), is getting rebranded yet again. This time around, the company will call it “G Suite.” Sounds more hip, right? Alongside the news, Google also noted a handful of upgrades and improvements in G Suite’s existing product lineup, which includes apps like Drive, Docs, Spreadsheets, Slides, Calendar, Hangouts, and more. But first of all: G Suite? Google claims the name better reflects the mission of helping people everywhere work and innovate together. Okay then. Ryan Tabone, Google’s director of product management for the G Suite, also told us that the company wanted to make it clear to potential enterprise users that that this is a unified collection of tools and not simply a set of individual offerings. The company then highlighted the growing use of machine intelligence – something Google has been investing in for over a decade – across G Suite’s products. Already, this technology has been used in a variety of other efforts, including instant translation and photo recognition, for example. It also powers the Smart Reply feature in Inbox, launched last year. Today, Google says that it’s bringing machine intelligence to more services, starting with Google Drive. A new feature called Quick Access in Drive on Android will take 50% off the average time it takes to get to the right file, by eliminating the need to search for it, says Google. Instead, machine learning will predict which file you need before you type and then display those near the top of the screen. The technology is able to make a smart guess about the file you might need based on things like your Drive activity, as well as your interaction with colleagues and your workday patterns like recurring team meetings or regular reviews of forecasting spreadsheets, explains Google. Meanwhile, Google Calendar’s Smart Scheduling feature, which was already live on Android, is now arriving on iOS, too, and will hit the web by year-end. This feature, again powered by machine intelligence, helps suggest meeting times and available rooms based on users’ preferences and other insights. Other improvements which have benefitted from machine learning include an Explore feature in Google Sheets, which lets you enter a question in natural language. The software then uses Natural Language Processing to translate that question into a formula and gives you an instant answer. Tabone noted that this is the kernel of what could be a very basic business intelligence system, too, but on an even more basic level, he told us that a third of Sheets users doesn’t understand how formulas work. Using natural language queries will now allow these users to bypass formulas and still get more value out of Sheets. Explore is also now arriving in Google Docs in order to recommend related topics to learn about, images to insert and more content to discover, says Google. It can point you to a related document in Drive, as well. And it’s coming to Google Slides to offer layout suggestions. To get these suggestions, you only have to drop an image into a slide. While Google doesn’t currently analyze the content of the image, it does look at its color palate and resolution to determine the layout. Team Drives In addition to the new features, Google is launching a new product today called Team Drives. This Google Drive offering focuses on managing content ownership and sharing at a team level, and introduces new roles that allow for more granular control over the content. It essentially gives teams a shared cloud storage space. Tabone tells us that Google actually had to do a rewrite of the technology stack that powers Drive to enable this feature. While it’s almost surprising that Google didn’t already offer this capability to share drives, Tabone noted that the industry as a whole mostly focused on individual productivity until now — and only recently started thinking about how to best enable teams to work together. However, Team Drives are only now becoming available through an Early Adopter Program, which follows a limited preview Google had run with a small number of customers. Through a similar Early Adopter program, companies can request access to an upgraded version of Google Hangouts, too. The revamped product will require no downloads or plugins, and will let anyone join from any device, even without an account or data connection. The new user interface will support up to 50 video participants. It will also integrate with Calendar and support instant screen sharing and recording. Google tells us that the team is already thinking about which other Hangouts features it can enable now that it has laid the groundwork with this new version. Tabone wasn’t quite ready to tell us about specific features, but tools like automatic transcripts and call analytics seem like especially low-hanging fruit. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Google Founded 1998 Overview Google is a multinational corporation that is specialized in internet-related services and products.

And rereleased. The Moto Z and Moto Z Force have been released. The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus have been released. Are there any upcoming new phones left to get excited about in the second half of 2016? Why yes, yes there are, and the world will get its first official look at them next Tuesday when Google hosts a press conference to introduce the Pixel and Pixel XL flagship phones. Of course, we don't have to wait for anything official to take a peak at what Google has in store. MUST SEE: Yup, now the iPhone 7 is exploding We've seen plenty of leaks that seemingly reveal various details and even images of Google's upcoming Pixel phones, which are believed to be taking the place of the company's Nexus smartphone lineup in 2016. Whereas Nexus phones focused on value, offering solid specs at low price points, the new Pixel and Pixel XL will reportedly both be premium flagship phones with high-end specs and much higher price points than Google fans are used to. Where specs are concerned, rumors suggest the phones will be powered by a Snapdragon 820 processor along with 4GB of RAM, between 32GB and 128GB of storage, a 12-megapixel rear camera, an 8-megapixel front-facing camera. The smaller Pixel will have a 5-inch 1080p display while the larger Pixel XL will reportedly pack a 5.5-inch 2K screen. Both phones will apparently launch with an unannounced version of Nougat, Android 7.1. We've seen leaks in the past that showed renders and even some blurry live photos of the phones, but a new offering from gadget leaker Steve Hemmerstoffer gives us what is likely our best look yet at the larger Pixel phone. Both phones are expected to share the same design, including that ugly glass or plastic panel at the top, so there likely won't be any hardware surprises next week. A video showing a 3D render of the new Google Pixel XL phone is embedded below. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6V1AYP8F-0 Google is expected to unveil both new phones during a big press conference on October 4th, where several other big announcements are also due.

The service allows users to buy songs and albums online. Its arrival has not been officially declared as yet. Users can buy music tracks and albums online through Google Play Music. Right now, a single track costs Rs 15 and an album is priced between Rs 90 to Rs 200. Genres like Bollywood, Hollywood, regional, and devotional music are available via the service. Google Play Music has not yet enabled online streaming. It also has not activated Google Play All Access subscription, radio, and podcast features. This may reduce the number of its subscribers as the Indian consumer is not yet used to buying music online. There is no dearth of online music streaming applications in India right now. Apps like Saavn, Gaana and Airtel Wynk Music have plenty of takers for themselves. Besides, the prices on Google Play Music are hardly favorably comparable to Apple Music offerings. Users can check if Google Play Music has been activated on their device by going to the Play Store and swiping right for the menu. The music button in the list will open up a library on clicking, thus activating the service on the concerned phone or tablet. Also see: Google announces new products for India Interested enthusiasts can also install Google Play Music on their desktops through the player app. Payments for purchases can be made via debit, credit, and Google Play cards. Users can even upload songs using the service through the Music Manager app. TAGS Android Google Google Play Music SHARE Facebook Twitter tweet Previous articleLeEco Le Max 2 price slash of Rs 5000 from October 1 to 6 Next articleAirtel announces new International Roaming Packs Sumit Chauhan RELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR Google Pixel launch in India next week, up for pre-order Google launches Pixel smartphone, India pre-booking from October 13 Google announces new products for India Trending Reliance Jio’s Welcome Offer could hurt itself, subscriber growth slows Keval Shah - Nov 17, 2016 While the telecom regulatory authority of India (TRAI) has given a clean chit to Reliance Jio's plan of free voice calls for users, industry...

Discussing the rebranded Google Cloud, Diane Greene, senior vice president of Google's enterprise business, said the company has made good progress courting customers and improving its technology. Cloud computing uses remote internet servers to store, manage and process data, and Google offers a range of apps like word processing and email, as well as the ability to host data and offer resources for developers. The new name replaces the Google for Work brand. "We are closing the gap incredibly fast" with competitors, Greene, a former CEO of VMware who joined Google last year to ramp up its cloud business, told experts and journalists at an event. Analysts say Google trails Amazon and Microsoft in market share but is gaining under Greene. Although the business is not big enough to break out separately in its quarterly earnings statement, Google reported a 33 percent surge in "other revenue" in its most recent quarter, which analysts said was probably due largely to gains in cloud computing. Greene has moved quickly to streamline engineering and appointed new leadership to beef up the company's cloud business. This has helped improve sales, Google Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai said during the company's latest earnings call. Earlier this month, Google acquired cloud software company Apigee Corp in a deal valued at about $625 million. The company on Thursday also announced a partnership with consultant Accenture to develop cloud services for clients in industries such a retail, healthcare and finance. In addition, the company said it had woven more artificial intelligence into its apps to help employees work more efficiently. Using machine learning to crunch troves of data, Google says its apps will prompt users to, say, open files at certain times of day or propose meetings based on their habits. Google recently added a U.S. data centre in Oregon in order to speed up service and next year will open more in Virginia, Mumbai, Singapore, Sydney, São Paulo, London, Finland and Frankfurt.

More Comments Tumblr Pinterest Reddit Digg FarkIt StumbleUpon In a cutthroat smartphone market where it is tough to pull consumers away from some of the juggernauts — such as Apple and Samsung — Motorola is betting on modular accessories that can be swapped in and out  to standout.  Purchased by Google in 2011 for US$12.5 billion — which, most importantly, included all of its patents — Motorola was later sold to the Lenovo in 2014 for just under US$3 billion. So now Motorola is back as its own standalone brand and returns to the hardware game once again with the release of the Moto Z and Moto Z Play — the former being their flagship premium model and the latter offering a less expensive alternative.  Both models use what Motorola calls Moto Mods, which have proprietary magnet inputs on the back that allow accessories such as a point-and-shoot camera, projector or speakers to attach to the back and transmit data (allowing for software updates and new features).  After using both phones and the suite of Moto Mods for a couple of weeks now, it’s obvious that these aren’t just a gimmick and actually offer an intriguing value proposition — for a price.  But first, evaluating the phones Though the Moto Z has been available in the U.S. since June (exclusively through Verizon), it’s now available unlocked and in Canada starting $900 off contract. It has a Snapdragon 820 processor, 4GB of RAM, a 13MP camera and weighs 136g. It’s a quad HD 5.5-inch screen with a resolution of 2560×1440 and 535 pixels per inch, meaning it looks great.  Because it’s so thin, the Moto Z doesn’t have a headphone jack and instead can use Bluetooth for audio or the included adapter to convert old headphones to the phone’s USB-C port (sound familiar?). Like with Apple’s new iPhone 7 models, this really doesn’t feel like too much of an issue though in day-to-day use. Now compare all of this to Moto Z’s less expensive sibling, the Moto Z Play (which starts at $650 off contract). The specs aren’t as beefy, with a Snapdragon 625 processor, 3GB of RAM and a 16MP camera (though a higher number, it doesn’t have optical stabilization and has a smaller aperture). It’s thicker, so there actually is a headphone jack and it weighs 165g. The screen is only full HD with a 1920 x 1080 resolution and 403 pixels per inch, meaning compared to the Moto Z it’s not as sharp and apps like YouTube will max out at 1080p (instead of 1440p).  Both come in 32 GB or 64 GB options, expandable up to a whopping 2TB with MicroSD cards. They have water-repellent coating, near field communication for digital wallets, fingerprint reader (though you’ll keep hitting it like a home button) and very impressive TurboPower-capable batteries.  The battery life is rather impressive, easily lasting throughout the day with typical use. Some benchmark tests by other media outlets have batteries lasting nearly a full day in airplane mode playing non-stop video. If the battery does become too low, the handy TurboPower feature gives you up to eight hours of power in just 15 minutes of charging, or in about 30 minutes you can get half of your battery back. Impressive.  Both phones feel good to hold, with the edge going to the Moto Z thanks to its comfortable slim form factor. Sometimes less actually is more as it feels so light, especially compared to Apple’s iPhone 7 Plus. Both phones are responsive and don’t show any signs of sluggishness. If you’re comfortable with Android, you’ll feel at home. However there are still some hiccups. Though the screens are gorgeous natively — even more so on the Moto Z — not many apps take advantage of the large real estate. It’s not the case with every app, but for example Twitter, Facebook or even Google’s built-in suite often feels like the resolution isn’t appropriate, with buttons or text taking up extra space when compared side-by-side to the iPhone — though often media in the app once opened looks fine. I went into the settings to change the phone’s font down to its smallest size to help free up screen space, but that only changes the text and not other elements. Perhaps this is just a victim of the fragmented Android ecosystem, so they can’t be coded for the Moto series directly. Both cameras shoot exceptionally well, too. The colours are a bit more vibrant on the premium Moto Z and its lowlight is better thanks to the different aperture. But though it has a quick autofocus and helpful optical image stabilization, you do see some of the Moto Z’s limitations as some photos aren’t as sharp in cases — such as if there are lots of edges or text to read in a wide-angle shot. But if you’re not using the phones for professional photography, it’s plenty capable and beats out entry-to-mid level competitors. The built-in speaker, on the other hand, is pretty horrible. It’s located in the same opening as the phone’s ear speaker, meaning you can expect plenty of tin-can sounding music or videos. It works as a quick fix, but at peak volumes it quickly starts breaking. Perhaps Motorola just wants you to buy a speaker Moto Mod. Speaking of which… Moto Mods: Choose-your-own-adventure accessories the differentiator What Motorola hopes will woo over users is its line of Moto Mods that work with both the Moto Z and Moto Z Play. On the bottom back of the phones are 16 small metal circles and a magnetic hole that allow various accessories to snap on and off as desired. So, for example, you can slap on a different back to change the look of the phone, depending on your flavour of the day or event you are attending. These Style Backs cost $29 and come in different colours and materials.  But the Moto Mods really get interesting with the accessories that add completely new functionality to the phones. Here’s the break down: Hasselblad True Zoom The flagship Moto Mod is the point-and-shoot style camera add-on that is made in partnership with cameramaker Hasselblad. Called the Hasselblad True Zoom, the accessory uses the native camera app but gives you a 10x optical zoom and set of buttons on the top that truly feel like a standalone point and shoot camera. It comes with its own carrying case, too, so the idea is that if you are out and want to quickly snap a picture of something far away you can reach into your bag and pull out the accessory to attach to your phone. The Hasselblad True Zoom has its own flash, better lowlight functionality than the phone’s built-in camera and optical image stabilization for still photos. You do lose megapixels though, moving down to 12 instead of the 13 megapixels in the phone’s camera, meaning other smartphone cameras can pump out better close-up shots. But the big thing here is the 10x zoom without losing image quality. The zoom works for video, too, but the quality is noticeably decreased because it switches to digital image stabilization and only shoots 1080p. Here are three photos taken with the Hasselblad True Zoom without physically moving. The first is in default position, the second is at 5x zoom and the final is 10x zoom. You can click the images to enlarge. The Hasselblad True Zoom releases in October for $349. Motorola Insta-Share Projector The other really nifty accessory is Motorola’s Insta-Share Projector, which once you attach will project the phone’s contents on the wall up to 70” in size. It has a built-in stand so you can rest the phone and either use the screen or a Bluetooth accessory to control whichever app you’re projecting. The accessory has Auto-Keystone correction up to +/- 40 degrees, so as you change the angle of the phone (say, move from the ceiling to the wall) it will adjust the angle of the projection accordingly. The contrast ratio is 400:1 and it has 50 lumens, meaning it works pretty well in dark and lowlight situations, especially for video or gaming. In brighter rooms it will be fine for presentations or work situations, but you won’t want to use it for anything too detailed. The resolution is only 480p though, and you’ll need to charge it separately. Want to watch a long movie? You’ll definitely need to plug it into the wall, since it only gets about an hour of battery life, plus you’ll want to hook up an external speaker because of the poor built-in speakers. That said, the projector is still a great accessory for those who want to quickly set up Netflix at the cottage, show a fun video to a group of people or if you want to do a quick work presentation. It’ll set you back $399 though, which is a pretty hefty price for an accessory. JBL SoundBoost Speaker If you find the audio quality of the Moto Z and Moto Z Play’s built-in speakers pretty bad, which they are, then the JBL Soundboost Speaker is a decent option. Attach it on the back and flip out the kickstand for better music and video audio quality, plus it can get relatively loud if you want to quickly throw something on for small gatherings. It can hit about 10 hours worth of battery life as well, which is nice. That said, aside from the on-the-go convenience, the audio quality still isn’t fantastic. When you get closer to its maximum volume, the audio does start to pop and gets muddy. It’s great for a few people nearby, but a standalone speaker with Bluetooth functionality may be a better option if you’re looking to play music at a party. Then again, the JBL Soundboost Speaker is designed to be quick, light and more for on-the-go purposes, and it does do all of that just fine. It has a $99 price tag. Incipio offGRID Power Pack As previously mentioned, both the Moto Z and the Moto Z Play have pretty fantastic battery life, plus the TurboPower charging feature makes topping up really quick. But if you still find yourself in need of some extra juice, you can pick up the Incipio offGRID Power Pack to attach on the back and essentially double the phone’s power. Related Apple iPhone 7 and 7 Plus review : No headphone jack, but camera alone enough to impress BlackBerry DTEK50 Review : Secure, reasonably priced but light on battery life Realistically, most people probably won’t need the accessory, but it is a nice option for those who may do intensive tasks for long periods of time and there really are no complaints to find with it. It costs $89. Final thoughts: Motorola is back The flagship Moto Z and cheaper Moto Z Play are both excellent Android phones that I found myself genuinely impressed with overall. Starting at $650 outright, the Moto Z Play in particular is a great value for a mid-range smartphone if you can live with some spec sacrifices. The Moto Z is aimed to be a premium product at a premium price ($900) and it definitely shows in day-to-day use with a better camera, screen and form factor. But now you are entering the iPhone 7’s price range, which has an appealing value proposition with a better camera and better use of screen real estate (albeit you’d get the smaller 4.7-inch iPhone). The biggest problem with the Moto Z and Moto Z Play is also its best feature: the Moto Mods. Quickly swapping out the back of the phone with various accessories for a variety of purposes is not just a great idea, but it’s a great conversation starter when you show it off to people. However it’s a very expensive proposition when compared to alternatives out there since you have to purchase everything separately, especially considering the flagship Moto Mods — like the projector and camera — costing several hundred dollars each.  Nonetheless, the Moto Z is a solid phone that feels great and is worth checking out if you’re in the market for a new Android device. Or, if you’re an iPhone user wanting to test the Android waters, the Moto Z Play is a great less expensive option while also making the Moto Mods look a little more affordable.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search Android Wear 2.0 launch pushed back into 2017 Eric Abent - Sep 29, 2016 0 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Google has made its third Android Wear 2.0 developer preview available, and along with some rather big features (like Google Play support), there comes a fairly major announcement: Google has decided to continue the Android Wear 2.0 developer preview into early 2017. This means that we won’t see the official roll out of the new operating system happen until sometime after that. Whether or not that’s a bad thing depends on who you ask. Developers will likely enjoy the extra time they’re being given for the preview, especially when you consider that Google has added support for an Android Wear version of the Play Store. With this latest preview, developers can publish their alpha and beta Android Wear apps to the Play Store, and users can search for them using voice, keyboard, handwriting, or recommended queries. Users won’t even need to install apps on both their phone and their watch, as Google is offering the ability to install only the watch version of a new app. If developers want to take it one step further, they have the option of only offering a watch app in the first place, being no longer required to publish phone versions of their apps. The arrival of the Play Store is definitely the biggest addition in developer preview 3, but coming along with it are new features such a complications permissions, inline actions, and a new UI component called Wearable Recycle View, which allows developers to display vertical lists that are optimized for round displays. To see the full round up of new features in Android Wear 2.0’s third developer preview or find out how to begin publishing apps to the Google Play Store, check out the source link below.

Networking | 29 Aug 2016 | Print  | Comment (2) Google’s Duo Video Chat App Links iOS and Android by Julio Ojeda-Zapata Our son is off to college, taking his first smartphone with him. While we’re an Apple household, he’s carrying a Google Nexus 5X on Google’s Project-Fi cell service. This platform gap creates a problem: how will we video chat with our young man? FaceTime isn’t an option. Apple’s video chat service doesn’t work outside the Mac and iOS ecosystems despite Apple’s early assurances that it would be made an open standard at some point. Apple has said nothing about this lately, and I’m not holding my breath. Our family has other options, including Skype (a favorite of my Mac-centric better half) and Facebook Messenger (to which my son and I are addicted). But Google has just swooped in with an intriguing third option: Duo. The previously announced video chat app has a potentially broad audience since it works on both the iPhone and Android phones (see “Google I/O 2016 Includes Announcements with Apple Appeal,” 23 May 2016). Its radical simplicity also makes competing apps look convoluted. However, Duo won’t be the ideal choice for all iPhone users, and FaceTime is likely to remain the default for those using Apple gear. Simple as Can Be -- Duo was designed from the ground up – and separately from Google’s other video chat app, Hangouts – to be simple and easy to use. All it requires for setup is your mobile phone number, which is what other Duo users need to reach you. Punch in your digits, and the app texts you a confirmation number. Tap that in, and you’re good to go. You’re then presented with a minimalist interface – a video window at the top and a Video Call button at the bottom. Tap the button and select a contact. If that person is a Duo user, the app initiates a call. If not, it texts out an invitation to install the app. Once you have a couple of calls under your belt, buttons for those contacts appear alongside the Video Call button, nudging it leftward. I derive comfort as a newly minted empty nester from having a dedicated button for my kiddo available for the tapping anytime. The actual call interface shows the other person full-screen, giving you a small bubble off to the side so you can make sure you’re properly framed. You can tap that button to switch places, showing your face full-screen and the other party in the bubble When you turn the phone to landscape mode, the video window adjusts to the new orientation, but if the other person doesn’t also rotate their phone, you’ll see gray bars on both sides of the picture. Tap the screen during a call to display buttons for muting the mic, swapping to the other camera, and ending the call. That’s Duo in a nutshell — I told you it was simple — although there is one novel twist, called Knock Knock. Knock Knock refers to a preview feature that shows live video of the caller before you accept the call. It’s handy for call screening and may inspire callers to engage in goofy hijinks to entice you into picking up. Knock Knock works only with callers who are in your contact list, so you’re protected from unwanted and potentially icky Knock Knocks. If a contact abuses Knock Knock, you can block them. There is a catch for iOS users: Duo must be open and on the screen for the preview to appear. Otherwise, incoming calls show only a call alert. You also have to unlock the iPhone before you can take the call, which isn’t necessary on Android. Duo Versus FaceTime -- On the surface, Duo seems like a FaceTime clone. Tap a contact, make a call. But FaceTime is more powerful and makes Duo look sparse. Here are things to keep in mind when comparing the two: Just a phone app: The fact that Duo works on Android as well as iOS is a plus, but that’s the extent of its hardware flexibility. It’s a phone app; that’s it. Though it runs on an iPad, even one without cellular service, it’s not optimized for larger screens. FaceTime works natively on the iPhone, iPad, and Mac. Only one device: When I tried to set up Duo on a second phone, Google canceled Duo access on the first device. The app is still there, but it wouldn’t let me use my phone number with Duo on more than one handset at a time. This is an annoyance for people like me who are accustomed to taking video calls on whatever device is handy. Apps like FaceTime, Facebook Messenger, and Hangouts connect with user accounts, not phone numbers, which frees them for use on multiple devices that are all logged into the same account. No audio calls (mostly): Duo’s video quality can adjust to varying conditions, which can range from a blazingly fast home broadband connection to an iffy cellular signal. It can also transfer calls almost seamlessly between Wi-Fi and cell connections. If a connection is particularly poor, Duo drops the call to just audio. This, however, is the extent of the app’s audio-only capabilities. You cannot choose to initiate an audio-only call, as you can with FaceTime and other apps. No group calls: As with FaceTime, Duo offers strictly one-to-one calls. In comparison, Google’s Hangouts and Skype both support video chats with three or more people. No text chat integration: When Google announced Duo in May 2016, the company also revealed the Allo text chat app that looks to give the revamped iOS 10 version of Messages stiff competition (see “iOS 10 Promises New Lock Screen, Open Siri, and More,” 13 June 2016). However, Duo and Allo are entirely separate apps, which is Google’s way of keeping them simple and uncluttered. It succeeded in this regard, particularly with Duo. For some, the lack of integration between the two apps could be problematic. Allo has yet to debut, so it’s possible that Google will link the two apps. That’s roughly what Apple did with FaceTime and Messages. Pull up a contact in FaceTime, and you see buttons to text that person, make a cell call, initiate a FaceTime session (audio or video) or send an email. The absence of such options in Duo is jarring. Separate from other Google apps: I’ve long used Google Voice, which gives me a phone number for calling, texts, and the like. It’s my One Number To Rule Them All, with options to relay incoming calls to other numbers (like my home and work land lines), among a plethora of other features. Google later released Hangouts, and the company has since haltingly and imperfectly labored to integrate Google Voice with Hangouts. Google has never completed that integration to my satisfaction; it’s a longstanding gripe with Google Voice users. And now Google has released yet another calling app that has no connection to Google Voice or Hangouts. This, too, is jarring, but understandable given that Google is starting fresh with a simple app (compared to Hangouts, which is nightmarishly convoluted). So Google users may be excused for watching this increasingly fragmented app landscape and wondering what the heck Google intends in the long term. Google has a history of unceremoniously executing apps and services it deems passé. Security: Duo and FaceTime are on par in one important respect: both Google and Apple offer end-to-end encryption for better security. Do the Duo -- For all of Duo’s shortcomings compared to FaceTime, it’s an app that any iPhone user with Android-using friends or family should install. It’s a painless way to open up another communications conduit that could prove useful. You have nothing to lose. I put Duo on my son’s Nexus 5X before I handed over the device, and made it clear to him that I’d be using it regularly; I couldn’t tell if he was pleased or chagrined. Likewise, I’m encouraging my semi-Luddite parents to use Duo. They have Apple devices but struggle to master their capabilities, and apps like Skype and FaceTime tend to fluster them. Duo is exactly their speed. Luckily, there’s no need for an either-or answer to the question of Duo or FaceTime. Most iPhone users will stick with Apple’s app given its additional features and compatibility across Apple’s hardware line. Those who need Android compatibility can add Duo, and if Duo ends up working better than FaceTime between Apple users, that’s fine too. Should Duo become a hit, I wonder if Apple might kick itself for not making FaceTime cross-platform as it had initially said it would. That seems like a missed opportunity.   READERS LIKE YOU!

I think it's still under appeal by one or the other, but since it's in East Texas, it's probably best not to hold our breaths.

The stage is now set. However, just when you thought you thought you’d seen it leaked from every angle, up pops a new 3D render of the larger HTC-made Pixel XL (codenamed Marlin). Related: What to expect from Google's October 4 launch? The prolific Steve Hemmerstoffer (aka @OnLeaks) has posted a new artist’s impression video based on what he says is the factory CAD file. If the render is to be believed, we’re looking at one attractive handset, featuring the rumoured two-toned rear casing. In an earlier tweet, OnLeaks also posted purported dimensions for the Pixel XL, claiming it’ll be 154.72mm x 75.74mm. He also corrected the below tweet to claim it’ll be 8.5mm thick at the top and slightly tapered at the 7.3mm bottom. The first Pixel phones look like Google’s new name for its Nexus range of own-branded devices and will arrive running the new Android Nougat OS. Google looks certain to reveal them on October 4 alongside a new 4K-capable Chromecast Ultra dongle and a home router called Google Wifi. We’re also expecting to hear from Google on pricing and availability of the Amazon Echo-rivaling Google Home speaker. The event kicks off at 17:00BST next week and will last for more than 2.5 hours.

Read more about the stories in today's news: Most Note7 Owners Want New Note7 Replacements, Samsung Claims HPE, Dell Unveil Systems, Services for Microsoft Azure IBM Launches Watson-Based Project DataWorks Google Touts Security Features of OnHub Home Router       Today's topics include Samsung's claims that many Note7 owners want replacement phones despite the recall, HPE and Dell's unveiling of their latest cloud platform offerings, IBM's launch of its new Watson-powered cloud-based big data analytics solution and Google's claims that its OnHub home router is one of the safest on the market. Since getting a global replacement program under way a week ago for its recalled Note7 flagship smartphones, Samsung reports that about 90 percent of Note7 owners are choosing to get another new Note7 after turning in their first-run devices, some of which had problems with battery fires and explosions. The recall is continuing around the world, yet some 90 percent of Galaxy Note7 users have been choosing to replace their phone with a new Note7 since the products became widely available, rather than choosing another Samsung smartphone or a refund, the company announced. Dell Technologies and Hewlett Packard Enterprise are pushing forward with their hybrid cloud efforts by introducing new integrated systems and services for Microsoft's Azure Stack software. The hardware vendors and software giant all view the future of enterprise technology in terms of hybrid clouds, where organizations will run some their applications and workloads in on-premises infrastructures while putting other applications into public cloud environments, such as Microsoft's Azure, Amazon Web Services or Google. The new systems unveiled this week—as the Microsoft Ignite 2016 conference is under way—will help businesses build the on-premises infrastructures that have the same agility and flexibility they can find in the cloud. IBM has dipped into its bag of technologies and come up with a new cloud-based data solution that very well may be a winner. IBM introduced an effort known as Project DataWorks, an initiative that taps the cognitive capabilities of IBM's Watson to help users integrate all types of data and make more informed, artificial intelligence-enhanced decisions. Big Blue has a knack for integrating technologies from its vast portfolio of older, legacy resources along with new innovations and open-source components. The Project DataWorks platform is meant to simplify the process of collecting, organizing, governing and securing data for everyday users. Slightly more than one year after announcing its OnHub home router, Google this week took the wraps off some of the features it says makes the device more secure than most comparable consumer products. OnHub is a router that Google claims supports WiFi for more than 100 devices at the same time. It comes with features that let users prioritize bandwidth availability for different home devices based on use. It allows users to boost WiFi speed for particular devices by waving a hand over the device and lets them allocate a separate network for guests in a home. The antenna on OnHub routers and its integrated software are designed to constantly search the airwaves for the fastest connections to ensure optimal performance, according to Google.       Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows IBM Aims Watson at Embodied Cognition Microsoft Advances 'Any Developer, Any App, Any Platform' Strategy Google Will Tag Frequent Violators of Its Site Safety Standards Intel Lights Up the Sky With New Shooting Star Drone Old School Polling Methods Hid Trump's Popularity With Voters 10 Reasons Not to Buy the Apple MacBo...

Any of these writer-friendly tablets. Sarah Tew/CNET Best tablets for taking notes 0 Share: Tablets by Xiomara Blanco September 29, 2016 12:43 PM PDT @zeeohmara Up Next President Obama slams fake news for eroding democracy I like to write. (I would hope so, since I do it for a living.) When a nascent idea or perfect sentence begins bubbling inside of my head, an onscreen keyboard gets the job done in a pinch, but when it comes to actually hunkering down and having a writing session it falls short of a traditional keyboard or pen and paper. If carrying around a laptop or notebook and pen isn't convenient for you (I always lose my pens, even the nice ones), here are the best tablet alternatives for cranking out those midterm papers or the last few chapters of your memoir. The sturdiest keyboard in all the land.Photo by Josh Miller/CNET Google Pixel C Often find yourself typing on your lap? The Google Pixel C has one of the sturdiest keyboards I've ever used. It attaches magnetically, but the magnets are so strong you can hold the tablet upside down and it won't budge. It's also one of the best Android tablets you can buy and, since it's a Google-branded device, it gets all the latest OS updates first. Enlarge Image A tablet with unique writing chops.Photo by Sarah Tew/CNET Lenovo Yoga Book The Lenovo Yoga Book is one of the coolest tablets I've seen in a long time. Its keyboard doubles as a Wacom tablet, meaning you can write on it with a stylus. And, if you prefer writing in a notebook (like myself), it comes with a (detachable) magnetic paper notepad that perfectly fits over the keyboard. You can write on it (just like a notebook) and all of your writing magically appears on the screen. Well, it's not magic, but it is one of the most innovative digital note-writing devices available. Enlarge Image Stylus included, but keyboard sold separately.Photo by Sarah Tew / CNET Microsoft Surface Pro 4 If you want a laptop inside of a tablet's body, the Microsoft Surface Pro 4 is the way to go. It comes with a stylus, but the keyboard is sold separately. You definitely want to pick one up to get the full Surface experience, though. The superslim keyboard magnetically attaches to the tablet and doubles as a cover when not in use. Aside from its impeccably compact design, it's also comfortable to use. Enlarge Image The Apple Pencil is a stylus made for artists, but writers can use it, too.Photo by Sarah Tew/CNET Apple iPad Pro The iPad is an obvious suggestion, right? But it's still worth mentioning, especially for those interested in using a stylus. The Apple iPad Pro comes in two sizes, a 9.7-inch model and a larger 12.9-inch version. Though the sold separately, Apple Pencil (it's not actually a pencil) is designed for artists and graphic designers -- anyone who simply wants a solid stylus should check it out. Not to mention, there's a bevy of keyboard accessories available for both models.

Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Facebook, IBM, and Google-owned British AI firm DeepMind on Wednesday announced a non-profit organization called "Partnership on AI" focused on helping the public understand the technology and practices in the field. The move comes amid concerns that new artificial intelligence efforts could spin out of control and end up being detrimental to society. The companies "will conduct research, recommend best practices, and publish research under an open license in areas such as ethics, fairness, and inclusivity; transparency, privacy, and interoperability; collaboration between people and AI systems; and the trustworthiness, reliability, and robustness of the technology," according to a statement. Academics, non-profit groups, and specialists in policy and ethics will be invited to join the board of the Partnership on Artificial Intelligence to Benefit People and Society (Partnership on AI). Microsoft on Thursday meanwhile took a further step on artificial intelligence, announcing a unit devoted to "democratizing" the technology, with more than 5,000 computer scientists and engineers. Microsoft expected its new AI and Research Group to speed up putting human-like thinking into virtual assistants, applications, services and computing infrastructures. "We are focused on empowering both people and organizations, by democratizing access to intelligence to help solve our most pressing challenges," Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella said in a release. "To do this, we are infusing AI into everything we deliver across our computing platforms and experiences." The new unit will include scientists from Microsoft Research, Bing and Cortana product groups, and its Ambient Computing and Robotics teams. Late last year, SpaceX founder and Tesla chief executive Elon Musk took part in creating nonprofit research company OpenAI devoted to developing artificial intelligence that will help people and not hurt them. Musk found himself in the middle of a technology world controversy by holding firm that AI could turn on humanity and be its ruin instead of a salvation. Google, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft are among technology giants that have been investing in making machines smarter, contending the goal is to improve lives. "If we create some digital super-intelligence that exceeds us in every way by a lot, it is very important that it be benign," Musk said at a Code Conference in California in June. A danger, he contended, was that highly advanced artificial intelligence would be left to its own devices, or in the hands of a few people, to the detriment of civilization as a whole.

Roston - Sep 29, 2016 5 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Rumor has it Google will be launching two new smartphones in the near future, the Google Pixel and Pixel XL. The Pixel is codenamed Sailfish, while the Pixel XL is codenamed Marlin; both have been the subject of numerous leaks, including visual ones that portend to show what the handsets will look like. Newest among those visual leaks is a new 3D render of the Pixel XL in particular, supposedly showing what the phone will look like based on a leaked factory CAD. The video below comes from @OnLeaks; it looks very similar to ones we’ve seen surface in recent days, and is similar in looks to the Google Pixel leaks, as well. Points of interest include a couple simple speaker grilles on the bottom, a USB-C port between them, as well as vaguely angular edges and an overall highly clean design. According to leaks thus far, it seems the Pixel XL will be offering the following specs, or something akin to them, though of course none of them are official at this point: Pixel XL (Marlin) • Display: 5.5-inch 2K 2560 x 1440 AMOLED • Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 • RAM: 4GB (3.7 benchmarked) • Internal Storage: 32GB, 128GB • Camera: 12MP back-facing camera with 4K video recording • Front-Camera: 8-megapixel • Battery: 3450-mAh • Connectivity: USB-C, Bluetooth 4.2, Wi-Fi, 4G LTE, 3G Speculation has it the phones may also have a desktop mode that will be accessible over Chromecast or through USB-C, with the software for that supposedly being called Andromeda (though whether that’s an official name or a codename isn’t clear). It’s expected Google will take the wraps off the phones early next month at a hardware event in which several other gadgets have been tipped, including a WiFi router. As always, we’ll have all the official details available as they go live; until then, check out the SlashGear Android hub for more news!

We already showed how big the rumored Google Pixel and Pixel XL could end up being when sized up against popular smartphones like the Nexus 6P or Galaxy S7 Edge, but that was based on screen size. Today, we have what could be solid dimensions for the Pixel XL along with a full, 360-degree 3D render showing off every single corner of the device. The leak comes to us from Steve Hemmerstoffer — also known as @Onleaks — who posted the render and dimensions onto his Twitter account. According to Hemmerstoffer, the dimensions for the Pixel XL are a little bit smaller than we’d expect for a device carrying “extra large” in its name, only a hair larger than the Galaxy Note 7. Take a look for yourself: Google Pixel XL 154.72 x 75.74 x 7.3mm (bottom) / 8.5mm (top) Samsung Galaxy Note 7 153.5 x 73.9 x 7.9 mm Apple iPhone 7 Plus 158.2 x 77.9 x 7.3mm Nexus 6P 159.3 x 77.8 x 7.3mm Of course, we’ll learn more as the event nears. So far it’s looking like Google could have a wide range of products to unveil at the event, with devices like the Google Pixel, Pixel XL, Google Home, Chromecast Ultra, Nexus 7P, and possibly more to show off come October 4th.

International Business Times, India Edition International Business Times, India Edition India World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Auto Health Photos Video Search Search Disney and Google join list of potential bidders for Twitter September 29, 2016 22:40 IST By IBTimes UK Close Embed <iframe src="http://www.ibtimes.co.in/tv/embed/41448" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe> With Twitter (US code: TWTR) likely to follow Linkedin into the arms of a tech giant with deep pockets, the question is: whos next on the shopping list of tech behemoths like Google, Apple and Microsoft? To recap: the business-focused social networking company Linkedin (LNKD) was bought up by Microsoft earlier this year for $26.2bn (Chart 1), while the core business of former internet pioneer Yahoo! (YHOO) was snapped up by US telecom company Verizon for $4.8bn. On Friday, Twitters share price surged by over 17% to over $23 per share (Chart 2) on the back of rumours that either Google or Salesforce.com were about to bid for the company. This is a classic case of an industry in the throes of consolidation: that is, fewer and fewer large companies buy up smaller rivals in order to dominate the business landscape. In this case, we can see that the internet landscape in being increasingly dominated by Google, Facebook and Microsoft. Lets take a quick look at each of the mooted bidders for Twitter, and examine why they might find Twitter an interesting business to absorb. Google/Alphabet (GOOGL): Beef up social networking footprint given Google+ also-ran status Why would Google be interested in buying up Twitter, to add to its stable of internet-related acquisitions such as Youtube (online video), Doubleclick and Admob (both in online advertising)? Well, lets start with the obvious. Google has singularly failed to compete effectively with Facebook in the social media space, allowing Facebook to dominate. Buying up Twitter would be one way for Google to grow its social media footprint massively in one go. The main revenues at Twitter come in the form of advertising revenues: well one thing is clear, that Google is a market leader in the online advertising space, and so could certainly find growth from synergies with Googles existing online ad businesses, including of course Youtube. Financing a potential buyout of Twitter at, lets say, $26 per share which was Twitters IPO price and well above the current $23-odd level would cost around $19bn. For a company of Googles size and considerable power, who have over $78bn in the bank currently, even a $19bn should not prove too heavy a burden, representing less than 4% of the value of Google. Salesforce.com (CRM) – a second suitor from the online software space Salesforce.com is an online business software company that operates Customer Relationship Management software for its business clients. This is basically an online database where a companys employees can store their notes about all discussions between themselves and their various clients, track the amount of client contact that employees have and thus measure their productivity. Twitter would be a much bigger morsel for salesforce.com to swallow, given that $19bn would represent nearly 40% of Salesforce.coms current size. Twitter has what is potentially a very valuable user database that Salesforce.com could exploit in their own business; but it is difficult to see them competing on price with Google, given the tech giants hugely superior financial muscle. Microsoft (MSFT): still absorbing Linkedin Microsoft is another technology giant that, like Google, has struggled to reach critical mass in the consumer internet space, with its search engine Bing notably struggling to compete with market leader Google. In addition, Microsoft is still in the process of absorbing business-focused social media pioneer Linkedin, which cost Microsoft a hefty $26bn just recently. The fit between business software leader Microsoft and Linkedin is obvious to see, given Linkedins focus on business social networks. So it is difficult to see the Redmond, Seattle-based software gorilla taking another big bite in the social media space just yet, given the risks of indigestion. Disney (DIS): Does this make sense? Last but not least, the US TV and film giant Disney has expressed interest in buying Twitter. The reasoning behind such interest is perhaps hard to see at first. It perhaps becomes a little clearer when you consider that Twitter recently broadcast NFL American Football night games over the internet, a business that Disneys ESPN TV sports division knows very well. Add in the fact that Twitters founder, Jack Dorsey, sits on Disneys board of directors, and the reasons for Disney potentially bidding for Twitter become somewhat clearer. Financing for such a deal is quite doable for Disney too, given a relatively low debt-load. But the real question is whether Disney, a traditional media player, is well-equipped to get the best out of this social media player. Previous internet and media marriages have ended in messy divorce in the past – just think of the AOL/Time Warner merger back in the heady days of 2000 or News Corp. buying up Myspace (where is Myspace today?). For that reason, I dont think a successful Disney bid is likely. Most likely outcomes for Twitter: Google takeover, or stays independent In my humble opinion, the most likely outcomes for the loss-making Twitter are the following: Google pays between $26 and $30 per share to buy Twitter in a deal agreed by the Twitter management; Twitter rejects all takeover offers and decides to continue to go it alone, resulting in a share price drop of up to 40% from current levels. Two final questions: who else could be bought, and what can investors buy? Which internet company could be the next in line to be bought up by a bigger player? I would look at eBay which – post spin-off of the Paypal division into a separately-listed company – is now a cheap internet company, with valuable growth in the form of Stubhub, an online sales platform for concert, sports and theatre tickets (Chart 4). Otherwise, I still believe that the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index in the US is worth investing in, to capture the growth in all these businesses. This can be accessed in the UK with the Powershares EQQQ Nasdaq 100 UCITS ETF (UK code EQQQ). IBT TV Mute Unmute Close Google, Microsoft, Disney: Which company will buy Twitter?

SiliconValley.com Twitter Facebook Google+ RSS   Social Web Mobile Cloud Gadgets Cleantech VC Data Games Policy Media   Facebook, Google, Amazon, Microsoft and IBM team up to address fears about artificial intelligence By Queenie Wong / September 29, 2016 at 11:37 AM Facebook, Google and other tech giants have used artificial intelligence to develop self-driving cars, describe photos for the blind, power virtual assistants or complete other tasks. But the technology — the topic of plenty of dystopian films and novels — has also drummed up fear and anxiety about a future where rogue robots outsmart humans or take over their jobs. Worth reading Superintelligence by Bostrom. We need to be super careful with AI. Potentially more dangerous than nukes. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) August 3, 2014 Now five major tech companies are teaming up to make sure artificial intelligence does more good than harm. On Thursday, Facebook, Google, Amazon, Microsoft, IBM and Google-owned DeepMind Technologies said they were forming a nonprofit called “the Partnership on Artificial Intelligence to Benefit People and Society” to develop best practices around ethics, transparency, fairness, privacy and other issues. “The possibilities for positively impacting a global society with advances in AI are numerous, ranging from connectivity, healthcare, and transportation. As researchers in industry, we take very seriously the trust people have in us to ensure advances are made with the utmost consideration for human values,” Yann LeCun, Director of Facebook AI Research, said in a statement. But the release of artificial intelligence-powered products hasn’t always gone as planned this year. In March, Microsoft suspended its Twitter chatbot Tay after it started tweeting racist and sexist remarks. In July, a futuristic security robot at the Stanford Shopping Center was accused of knocking over a toddler and running over its foot. And for the first time, a Tesla driver using Autopilot was killed in a collision with a truck in Florida. The Partnership on AI plans to conduct research, recommend best practices and publish its findings. The nonprofit does not intend to lobby government or other policymakers. Members of the organization include: LeCun; Amazon’s Director of Machine Learning Ralf Herbrich, DeepMind’s co-founder and Head of Applied AI Mustafa Suleyman; Google Research’s Senior Scientist Greg Corrado; IBM Research Scientist Francesca Rossi; and Microsoft’s Technical Fellow and managing director of its Washington research lab Eric Horvitz. Horvitz and Suleyman are interim co-chairmen of the nonprofit. The organization is also inviting academics, non-profits, and specialists in policy and ethics to join its board.

By CRISELDA VALDEZ THE BROWNSVILLE HERALD More than 500 students gathered at Lopez High School Saturday to compete in the South Texas Region VII Scholastic Chess Championship. The students, from kindergarten through 12th grades, battled for ribbons, medals and trophies. They represented schools from Corpus Christi, Laredo and the Rio Grande Valley. According to Morningside Elementary chess coach Russell Harwood, the majority of students competing were in the lower age level. The biggest group of kids here are the ones that are fairly new to the game, he said. Brownsville has been making its mark in the pasttime for the past eight years. Russell Elementary was the first school to win a state title eight years ago. The school kept the title until last year when Morningside Elementary won. We plan on doing it again, parent Minerva Pea said. Pea is involved with the chess teams at Hudson Elementary and Oliveira Middle School. We (Brownsvilles chess teams) are recognized out of state, she said. It is something to be very proud of. Remy Ferrari, a second-grade teacher at Morningside who serves as chess coach, has been credited with getting students more involved in chess. Victor Pea, a fifth grader at Morningside, said he started playing chess in the second grade because of Ferrari. Pea was on the team that won state last year and even placed 3rd in nationals on an individual level. Ferrari said once he sees students taking an active interest in the game, he gets them to compete. But we dont look at it as competition. We go out to have fun, he noted. Pea and his companion, Danny Garcia, also a fifth grader, agreed. I play because its fun, Garcia said. This recognition is certainly getting peoples attention. Cromack Elementary is competing this year after disbanding for a year. Our principal, Oscar Cantu, Jr, was very interested in chess and asked if it would be possible to get a team, sponsor Tom Garza said. Garza said his team has won three trophies in all three tournaments it has competed in this school year. Theyre doing great, he said. It teaches them self-confidence. Christopher Herrera, a student at Cromack, added: I feel good when I win. Discuss Print Posted in Education on Sunday, February 11, 2001 12:00 am.

This includes Google Cloud Platform, Maps and Machine Learning APIs, the newly-rebranded “G Suite,” as well as the Chrome and Android devices that give users access. But Google is also today announcing advancements across its cloud and enterprise offerings… Really, Google Cloud is just an effort to unify all of Google’s cloud offerings under one umbrella. As Google Cloud SVP Diane Greene explains: Google Cloud spans every layer, it includes all of Google Cloud Platform; our user facing collaboration and productivity applications — now named G Suite; all of our Machine Learning tools and APIs; the enterprise maps API’s; and also the Android phones, tablets, and Chromebooks that access the cloud. All of this, built for the cloud from the get-go. Moving into what Google calls the “Google Cloud era,” the company also announced new products and services for the Cloud Platform: Eight new Google Cloud Regions: Mumbai, Singapore, Sydney, Northern Virginia, São Paulo, London, Finland and Frankfurt Kubernetes 1.4, which “improves Cluster Federation to support straightforward deployment across multiple clusters and multiple clouds.” Many updates to its data analytics and machine learning portfolio, including upgrades to Google BigQuery and Cloud Machine Learning. A new role on the GCP team called Customer Reliability Engineering, which is” designed to deepen our partnership with customers.” Also mentioned today is the rebranding of Google Apps for Work. Now known as G Suite, there’s nothing really much that’s dramatically changing about the group of enterprise services, but Google has today announced a slew of advancements across the board: Quick Access in Google Drive for Android, “which shaves 50 percent off the average time it takes to get to the right file by eliminating the need to search for it.” “Find a time” in Google Calendar, which “suggests meeting times and available rooms based on your preferences.” Smarter spreadseets: “You can simply enter your question using natural language and Explore in Google Sheets will use Natural Language Processing to translate your question into a formula and offer an instant answer.” Explore in Google Docs, which uses machine intelligence to “automatically recommend related topics to learn about, images to insert and more content to discover.” Explore in Google Slide, which “dynamically offers layout suggestions that help your content shine.” Team Drives, which “helps streamline teamwork from end-to-end, from onboarding a new team member to offboarding a departing team member.” Team Meetings, which is a new meeting experience for Google Hangouts that makes things easier: “no downloads, no browser plugins, invite anyone, join from any device, even without an account or a data connection.” Many of these features haven’t launched publicly yet, but Google plans to launch them with organizations that are interested by way of an Early Adopter Program. Google also announced today an alliance with Accenture: Google and Accenture will work together to deliver solutions to customers in a number of industry-specific verticals, including retail, healthcare, energy, finance and others. The solutions will combine technology from across Google’s products and platforms. Accenture and Google will provide dedicated resources from each company with expertise in cloud solutions architecture, mobility and app development to help bring these solutions to large enterprise clients.

Follow TechnoBuffalo Since Android Wear 2.0’s unveiling in May, Google has been relatively quiet about when the final version would be available. Fans were originally told to expect a release this fall, but Google on Thursday revealed we’ll actually have to wait a bit longer until the final version is available. The good news is that a new Developer Preview is out, giving Android Wear users access to the Play Store app. The new addition will make it easy for users to find and install apps directly on the watch, which is one of Android Wear 2.0’s biggest new features. Google says that having a “on-watch store” makes app discovery easier, and was often requested by developers. Google says that users can browse recommended apps, search for apps using voice, keyboard, and handwriting, and even download alpha and beta tests. The coolest part, according to Google, is that users can download apps on their watch but not on their phone; phone apps aren’t necessary. You can see what new features are available in Developer Preview 3 by hitting the source link below. There will likely be one more preview release before the final version hits sometime early next year.

Ann Hermes/The Christian Science Monitor/File View Caption About video ads View Caption of If science fiction is a reflection of our fears, then we are afraid of a robot takeover. To counter fears about artificial intelligence replacing humans at work and at home, as well as agree on industry-wide ethics for the growing technology, five of the world's largest tech companies have joined together. “The Partnership on Artificial Intelligence to Benefit People and Society” was created by Amazon, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, and IBM, they announced in a statement Wednesday. Academics, nonprofit researchers, and experts in policy and ethics will also be included. Apple is also in talks with the partnership, but has not yet decided if it will join, according to The Verge. Recommended: Despite sci-fi tropes, robots make better managers, study says Once reserved for sci-fi dystopias, artificial intelligence has become a daily reality in the internet era, powering Apple's Siri, chatbots on Facebook Messenger, and even web searches. Despite sci-fi tropes, robots make better managers, study says Photos of the Day Photos of the Day 11/18 It hasn’t been all good. Twitter Tay, a chatbot Microsoft introduced to Twitter, started to rattle off offensive Tweets less than 24 hours after it went online, and the Tesla Autopilot feature and the driver behind the wheel both failed to see a tractor-trailer before it was too late, resulting in a fatal crash in Florida in May.  The partnership has two goals: educate the public about AI and recommend industry-wide ethics and best practices, such as the role of machine intelligence in life-threatening situations like warfare, healthcare, and transportation. “The reason we all work on AI is because we passionately believe its ability to transform our world,” Mustafa Suleyman, on of the founders of Google DeepMind and a chair of the Partnership on AI, said in a call with the media Wednesday. “The positive impact of AI will depend not only on the quality of our algorithms, but on the amount of public discussion … to ensure AI is understood by – and benefits – as many people as possible.”  Subbarao Kambhampati, a computer science professor at Arizona State University and president of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI), said the coalition is timely and needed. "There have been situations already where companies had to essentially make up their own best practices," he told NPR. "Most of the times, things work out well, but sometimes they haven’t." Dr. Kambhampati and AAAI will have a seat on the coalition. In addition to the Tesla crash in May, and snafus by Microsoft’s Twitter Tay and Google’s facial recognition software, there has been fearful speculation robots will replace humans in much of the workplace. Robert Reich, the former secretary of Labor and a current professor at UC-Berkeley, wrote about this fear in 2015. Kodak’s workforce, writes Professor Reich, peaked in 1988 at 145,000 employees. When Kodak filed for bankruptcy in 2012, Instagram was serving 30 million customers with just 13 employees.  New technologies aren’t just labor-replacing. They’re also knowledge-replacing. The combination of advanced sensors, voice recognition, artificial intelligence, big data, text-mining, and pattern-recognition algorithms, is generating smart robots capable of quickly learning human actions, and even learning from one another. If you think being a “professional” makes your job safe, think again. In January 2015, entrepreneur and Tesla founder Elon Musk donated $10 million to the Future of Life Institute (FLI) to “ mitigate existential risks racing humanity” – including AI. But industry leaders have been tackling these "existential risks" for years. In addition to this partnership, Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and IBM are also on a Stanford University coalition, the “One Hundred Year Study on Artificial Intelligence,” known as AI100, which is examining how AI will enter our lives in the next 100 years.  "Building advanced AI is like launching a rocket,” said Jaan Tallinn, co-founder of FLI and Skype, in 2015. “The first challenge is to maximize acceleration, but once it starts picking up speed, you also need to focus on steering."

On Thursday, Urs Hölzle, the company's senior vice president of technical infrastructure, unveiled eight forthcoming regions around the world for the company's cloud services. The regions are all slated to launch in 2017 and will be comprised of multiple data centers for companies looking to run high-availability applications. Having a broad distribution of cloud infrastructure is important to Google's competitive chances. More and more countries are requiring that some types of data are stored in particular geographic locations. And even with high-speed networks, a large distance between where an application is hosted and where its users are located will lead to a slowdown. One of Google's biggest weak points in competition with Microsoft and Amazon has been its relative paucity of regions compared to those other platforms. Prior to Thursday, Google had announced six regions, while Amazon has 17 regions announced, and Microsoft has 34. This isn't a perfect comparison, because of the varying ways the companies count regions. This announcement brings Google's announced region number up to 14, and Hölzle said the company plans to launch roughly one new region a month in 2017. If Google keeps to that plan, the company could have up to 18 regions by the end of that year. Google This graphic shows all of Google's announced cloud platform regions as of September 29, 2016. The new regions announced Thursday will be available in Mumbai, India; Singapore; Sydney, Australia; northern Virginia; São Paulo, Brazil; London, England; Finland; and Frankfurt, Germany. They join Google's existing regions in Oregon, Iowa, South Carolina, Belgium, and Taiwan, along with a Japan region that's scheduled to come online this year. Google plans to have all of its services available in those regions when they launch, though the company hasn't laid out an exact schedule for when the services will be live. The announcement is part of Google's ongoing push to get companies to use its cloud platform. The company also announced Thursday that it's rebranding its enterprise-focused division to Google Cloud, dropping the Google for Work moniker it's been using for a couple of years. None of Google's major competitors are standing still, however. Amazon is hosting its major Re:Invent conference at the end of November, and it's reasonable to expect that the company will have news to share there.

Google today announced that it’s got new voice commands in Google Maps for Android. When you’re in navigation mode or driving mode, you can say “Ok Google” and then give a voice command, allowing you to perform tasks without looking at your phone’s display. Any time that you see a white microphone in the upper right corner of your screen, you can give a voice command. One example of the voice commands that you can give Google Maps is “Ok Google, find gas stations.” Some of the other commands that you can give Google Maps include “Show/Hide traffic”, “How’s traffic ahead?”, “Show alternate routes”, and “Avoid tolls/highways/ferries”. Here are a bunch of other voice commands that you can use in Google Maps: “Mute." or "Mute voice guidance." "Unmute." or "Unmute voice guidance." "Show traffic." or "Hide traffic." "Show satellite." or "Hide satellite." "Navigate home." or "Navigate to Starbucks." "Show route overview." or "Show alternate routes." "What road is this?" "What’s my next turn?" "What's my ETA?" "How's traffic ahead?" or "How's traffic to home?" "What's the weather like?" "Avoid tolls." or "Enable tolls." "Avoid highways." or "Enable highways." "Avoid ferries." or "Enable ferries." "Exit navigation." "Call Mom." "Find gas stations." or "Find restaurants." "Send a text to Larry." or "Send a SMS to Sergey, I'm feeling lucky." "What's the weather like?" or "How's the weather in Seattle?" "Play some jazz." or "Play happy birthday on Google Play Music." "What's the closest hotel?" "When's my next meeting?" It’s good to see Google Maps offering lots of voice commands, because many people use Google’s mapping app while driving, and those people shouldn’t be using their hands to control their phone. In order to use these voice commands, you’ll need the latest version of Google Maps for Android, which you can find here.

Google today unleashed Android Wear 2.0 Developer Preview 3. The most notable addition here is Google Play, which lets you browse and search for apps on your watch. You can also switch accounts, update or uninstall apps, and the ability to install an app on your watch but not on your phone. Google says that devs can now build and publish watch-only apps in Google Play. Android Wear Developer Preview 3.0 includes a few other goodies, such as complications improvements and Smart Reply responses. The addition of the Play Store is definitely the biggest addition, though, giving you control over your watch’s apps directly on your watch. It’s also nice that users can skip a phone app and publish apps only on their watch, which will let them avoid cluttering up their phone with apps that they only want for their watch. Google today also revealed that it’s delaying the full release of Android Wear 2.0. Rather than release Android Wear 2.0 to the public this fall like it originally planned, Google now says that it’ll continue its preview program into early 2017, at which point it’ll release Android Wear 2.0 to everyone.

Although that’s not always a good sign (look what happened with Project Ara), it appears Google has had their head down working on an exciting new features left out of their Google IO announcement: Android Wear 2.0 will bring access to the Google Play Store, directly from the watch itself. This is pretty big news as users will be able to browse Android Wear specific apps, watch faces, and possibly even games straight from their watch. As we start seeing more cellular enabled watches come forth, this is starting to make a lot of sense. The platform’s 3rd developer preview is ready right now — along with the Android Wear Google Play Store — with one more preview before the official update it passed onto manufacturer’s for distribution. Pretty exciting stuff, especially if you plan on nabbing one of those new watches with e-SIM built-in.

Android Wear 2.0, which was first announced at Google's I/O conference in May, was supposed to launch this fall and introduce a bunch of new features to Android smartwatches, including standalone apps that run independently of the phone, new fitness tracking features, and an on-screen keyboard. An early version of Android Wear 2.0 is available for developers who want to build apps for the platform. But Google noted, at the bottom of a blog post for developers about the latest updates, that it will be holding back the final version of the software until next year. "We’ve decided to continue the preview program into early 2017, at which point the first watches will receive Android Wear 2.0," Google said in the post, without providing a reason for the change.  Holiday miss The delay means that Google and its partners will not be able to sell a new generation of Android Wear smartwatches during the all-important holiday season, even as Apple has just released a new version of its smartwatch. It's been a slow start for Android Wear, which launched two years ago. But the wearables category has been dominated by FitBit, Apple, and Garmin, according to research firm IDC. Meanwhile, three of the top Android Wear watch manufacturers — LG, Motorola, and Huawei  — said earlier this month that they do not plan to release new Android Wear devices this year. Huawei is said to be considering ditching Android Wear for Samsung's Tizen, according to the Korea Herald. Despite the lack of new major new hardware, a source familiar with Google's plans for Android Wear told Business Insider that the product pipeline is still full, and new watches could launch in the coming months, perhaps around the same time Android Wear 2.0 is available to the public. And some fashion brands like Fossil and Michael Kors have recently released Android Wear watches, although they aren't likely to have the same draw as smartwatches built by tech companies.  NOW WATCH: Apple is changing the way you use the home button on the iPhone 7 More From Business Insider Google might release a new laptop and tablet that run on a completely new operating system Google's Home might cost $50 less than Amazon's Echo Alphabet has been secretly working on a new health smartwatch that doesn't need to be charged every day Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share What to read next Soon, an app to locate the nearest toilet in Delhi-NCR The Hindu Set up panel to check sex tests, SC tells Centre Deccan Herald Google will tell you where to take a dump when nature comes calling Gizmodo Google will face tough regulatory policies under President-elect Donald Trump – Tech2 Tech2 Cricket: Ashwin puts India on top in 2nd England Test AFP Salman and Parineeti shake it off at Sania Mirza’s sisters’s sangeet India Newzstreet Media Take your pick: Saha's run out vs Dhoni's run out Yahoo!

Snapchat Spectacles are a low-stakes, cheap way to enter the wearables market.  (Handout)   By Raju MudharTech Reporter Thu., Sept. 29, 2016 With the recent announcement that Snapchat is launching Spectacles, a $130 (U.S.) pair of glasses that can record videos, it brings a new approach that should be welcome to the wearable technology industry. While a lot is still unknown — in particular, how and when to buy these things — there's lots of interesting speculation about how that company hopes to succeed where Google failed with its Glasses. First, let's note that this is the company's first hardware release, and with it, it has shortened its name to Snap Inc., a sign that the company wants to expand its focus from the ephemeral messaging social network that has grown to be valued at $20 billion with over 150 million daily users who share more than 1 billion snaps daily and have watched more than 10 billion videos. Spectacles are video camera glasses that with a tap of a button near the arm will be able to record 10 seconds of video straight to the app. They will connect via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi, shoot with a wide 115-degree, first-person view and take circular videos. At first glance, these new specs are downright goofy, but there are some good things happening here that perhaps other wearable manufacturers can take their cue from. Because at this point, after a few years of existence, most of the wearable segment could really use a makeover. Article Continued Below For instance, right now, if you don't own a smartwatch, you are the smart one. I bet you have some kind of activity tracker, most likely bought as a gift by a well-meaning family member, and I'll go double or nothing that after trying it out for a few weeks, it now sits somewhere in a drawer. It's been a couple of years of wearable hype, and while there are still sky-high estimations of how the sector is set to grow — to as much as $34 billion in 2020 — and despite a tonne of product, and decent sales, right now, I'd be hard pressed to recommend any product, other than for early adopters, who by now, have likely tried a few. The first good thing about Spectacles is the price. Even without a confirmed Canadian price, they appear to be a tenth of what Google Glass what cost. They also look like a fairly normal pair of glasses, as opposed to the Google's “Locutus of Borg” inspired look. Hey, I love Star Trek as much as anybody, but that just wasn't a good look and because they screamed "Look at these things on my face!" it was easy for people to think they were creepy. With Spectacles, just like Snapchat, many of the oldsters will have no idea what these glasses can do, which is a brilliant marketing and product design move. The other really important thing is that Spectacles are simple. All they can do is take quick videos. Google wanted to create a platform, while Snap just wants people to take funny videos. Now, the Wall Street Journal article that broke the story said that in the long run, Snap Inc. founder Evan Spiegel is excited at the possibility of having full control of a camera, so more is likely coming down the line, but for now, Spectacles are just for Snaps and that's a good thing. The biggest problem with most wearables is that they tend to be solutions in search of a problem. And the stuff they can do, most don't do particularly well. The largest sector, the entire fitness tracking segment, is plagued by the fact that while it seems easy to count someone's steps or other exercise activity, none of the devices are yet smart enough to tell people what to do with it. Wearables need more actionable intelligence, like perhaps being able to tell people that their exercise form is wrong, or potentially suggest exercises to help meet a particular goal. You know, like an actual virtual trainer as opposed to a fancy pedometer. Of course, there is plenty that can go wrong with Spectacles. It's the first piece of hardware that the company will make and you only need to look at several crowdfunding disasters to know how well that has worked out for countless companies. There is also no doubt that Spectacles will likely face the exact same privacy concerns that were brought up with Google Glass. But Snap Inc. is framing Spectacles as a toy and the entire product as a bit of a lark, which is very smart. It's a low-stakes, cheap way to enter the wearables market, and if they take off, one that hopefully teaches the industry some lessons. The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.

Amazon, DeepMind/Google, Facebook, IBM, and Microsoft have announced a partnership to address the benefits and challenges associated with artificial intelligence. All five are deeply involved in artificial intelligence research. For example, Amazon offers web developers machine learning capabilities and sells the Echo, a voice-controlled, personal robot. Google has DeepMind, the machine that processes information like the human brain. IBM has Watson. But like all intelligence, the artificial kind falls along a spectrum. At the bottom is weak A.I. (or narrow A.I.), which is a non-sentient program focused on a narrow task. Think of Apple's Siri. RELATED: 'Ex Machina': Science vs. Fiction At the other end is strong A.I. (also called full A.I. and artificial general intelligence). It doesn't exist yet, but If it did, it would have the full range of human cognitive abilities and probably then some. A number of recent movies feature A.I. beings, including Her, Ex Machina, Chappie, and of course the 1984 classic, The Terminator. Even before society finds itself having to deal with time-traveling, autonomous, killer robots, it should be developing best practices in this relatively new area of research. We've already seen versions of A.I. doing some pretty wacky things. Take Microsoft's Twitter bot, Tay, which in less than day began unleashing racist, inflammatory tweets and had to be deleted. And so far, the A.I. at the wheel of self-driving cars hasn't proved itself perfect yet. A self-driving Tesla crashed earlier this year and two days ago, so did one from Google. WATCH VIDEO: Where the Future of A.I. Is Headed Enter the nonprofit Partnership on A.I., a collaboration between Amazon, DeepMind/Google, Facebook, IBM, and Microsoft to "advance public understanding of artificial intelligence technologies (AI) and formulate best practices on the challenges and opportunities within the field." According to the announcement, each company will contribute money and research resources to develop A.I. technology meant to benefit people and society. Any research conducted will be published under an open license for all to read and share. The partnership is not the first of its kind. In 2015, OpenAI launched as did Future of Life, the latter of which goes beyond artificial intelligence, to look at biotech, nuclear and climate. Research in these areas is inevitable. There are milestones to reach and challenges to overcome. Certainly A.I. holds the potential to improve human life, from automating our homes and jobs to helping us solve problems related to disease and poverty. The hope is to do that without terminating ourselves in the process.

Google rebrands its business apps as G Suite, upgrades apps & announces Team Drive Posted Sep 29, 2016 by Sarah Perez (@sarahintampa), Frederic Lardinois (@fredericl) 0 SHARES Next Story Tales from a Tesla Model S at 200k miles Google announced today that its now ten-year old service Google Apps for Work (formerly Google Apps for Your Domain), is getting rebranded yet again. This time around, the company will call it “G Suite.” Sounds more hip, right? Alongside the news, Google also noted a handful of upgrades and improvements in G Suite’s existing product lineup, which includes apps like Drive, Docs, Spreadsheets, Slides, Calendar, Hangouts, and more. But first of all: G Suite? Google claims the name better reflects the mission of helping people everywhere work and innovate together. Okay then. Ryan Tabone, Google’s director of product management for the G Suite, also told us that the company wanted to make it clear to potential enterprise users that that this is a unified collection of tools and not simply a set of individual offerings. The company then highlighted the growing use of machine intelligence – something Google has been investing in for over a decade – across G Suite’s products. Already, this technology has been used in a variety of other efforts, including instant translation and photo recognition, for example. It also powers the Smart Reply feature in Inbox, launched last year. Today, Google says that it’s bringing machine intelligence to more services, starting with Google Drive. A new feature called Quick Access in Drive on Android will take 50% off the average time it takes to get to the right file, by eliminating the need to search for it, says Google. Instead, machine learning will predict which file you need before you type and then display those near the top of the screen. The technology is able to make a smart guess about the file you might need based on things like your Drive activity, as well as your interaction with colleagues and your workday patterns like recurring team meetings or regular reviews of forecasting spreadsheets, explains Google. Meanwhile, Google Calendar’s Smart Scheduling feature, which was already live on Android, is now arriving on iOS, too, and will hit the web by year-end. This feature, again powered by machine intelligence, helps suggest meeting times and available rooms based on users’ preferences and other insights. Other improvements which have benefitted from machine learning include an Explore feature in Google Sheets, which lets you enter a question in natural language. The software then uses Natural Language Processing to translate that question into a formula and gives you an instant answer. Tabone noted that this is the kernel of what could be a very basic business intelligence system, too, but on an even more basic level, he told us that a third of Sheets users doesn’t understand how formulas work. Using natural language queries will now allow these users to bypass formulas and still get more value out of Sheets. Explore is also now arriving in Google Docs in order to recommend related topics to learn about, images to insert and more content to discover, says Google. It can point you to a related document in Drive, as well. And it’s coming to Google Slides to offer layout suggestions. To get these suggestions, you only have to drop an image into a slide. While Google doesn’t currently analyze the content of the image, it does look at its color palate and resolution to determine the layout. Team Drives In addition to the new features, Google is launching a new product today called Team Drives. This Google Drive offering focuses on managing content ownership and sharing at a team level, and introduces new roles that allow for more granular control over the content. It essentially gives teams a shared cloud storage space. Tabone tells us that Google actually had to do a rewrite of the technology stack that powers Drive to enable this feature. While it’s almost surprising that Google didn’t already offer this capability to share drives, Tabone noted that the industry as a whole mostly focused on individual productivity until now — and only recently started thinking about how to best enable teams to work together. However, Team Drives are only now becoming available through an Early Adopter Program, which follows a limited preview Google had run with a small number of customers. Through a similar Early Adopter program, companies can request access to an upgraded version of Google Hangouts, too. The revamped product will require no downloads or plugins, and will let anyone join from any device, even without an account or data connection. The new user interface will support up to 50 video participants. It will also integrate with Calendar and support instant screen sharing and recording. Google tells us that the team is already thinking about which other Hangouts features it can enable now that it has laid the groundwork with this new version. Tabone wasn’t quite ready to tell us about specific features, but tools like automatic transcripts and call analytics seem like especially low-hanging fruit. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Google Founded 1998 Overview Google is a multinational corporation that is specialized in internet-related services and products.

Google is using the time to improve the operating system and will release several more developer previews. Today’s release features a Play Store accessible directly from the watch and many other features. Google cites “quality requirements” for the platform as the reason for the postponement and not hardware delays. Notably, major partners like Huawei, LG, and Motorola announced earlier this month that they won’t be releasing new devices in 2016. Additionally, we have not heard much about Google’s rumored Android Wear devices. Developer Preview 3 adds several new features, but most notable is a Play Store directly on the watch. By making Android Wear less dependent on a phone, it will allow iOS users to installs apps. The Play Store will download apps over Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or a cellular connection. At the moment, paid app purchases still need to be authenticated on a phone. The “My apps” section will allow you to update or uninstall apps and users can now choose to just download the watch component of an app. Other features include interface enhancements for round watches and Smart Reply to automatically respond to incoming messages. The latter feature is already enabled for apps like Allo and Hangouts, but requires other developers to add the feature.  There are also improvements to complication permissions and inline notifications. The developer preview is still only available for the Huawei Watch and LG Watch Urbane 2nd Edition LTE. Google will release another preview before the year is up and expects current devices to get Android Wear 2.0 when the final version launches next year.

Google is expected to add a virtual reality component to its new phone.  (Eric Gaillard / Reuters)   By Eli BlumenthalUSA Today Thu., Sept. 29, 2016 Google has built intense speculation for its Oct. 4 event in San Francisco, where it’s expected to reveal new phones aimed at consumers that will power a new virtual reality platform, and possibly, other smart-home devices. Now that the buzz has reached a football-stadium roar, here comes the hard part: Living up to the hype. Google has been teasing the event as one for the history books. A tweet Monday from Hiroshi Lockheimer, the company’s senior vice president of Android, Chrome OS and Google Play, turned up the volume. “We announced the 1st version of Android 8 years ago today,” Lockheimer wrote in the tweet that has been retweeted more than 2,200 times. “I have a feeling 8 years from now we’ll be talking about Oct 4, 2016.” In the days since Google sent out the invitations to the media, the company has set up a website, https://madeby.google.com/, and put up large billboards in New York and other cities in the U.S. featuring the silhouette of a phone centered around the hashtag, #madebyGoogle. Article Continued Below Google has gone so far as to erect statues with the rectangle outline in Brooklyn and Sydney, Australia. What does this all point to? A likely candidate: New phones from manufacturer HTC, taking on the Pixel brand the company used with its Chromebook and tablet efforts. Rumors and leaks point to devices with large displays — 5-inches for the Pixel and 5.5-inches for the larger Pixel XL, fast processors, improved cameras and sleek aluminum and glass designs. Both phones are expected to have headphone jacks, according to the website Android Police, which has provided many of the leaked details around the phones and Google’s event. A Google spokesperson declined to comment. It is through Pixel that Google will likely make its biggest play yet for consumers when it comes to phones. “They clearly are positioning themselves very differently than they have in the past and I think that is why the rumor is they are going to use the Pixel brand as opposed to the Nexus,” says Avi Greengart, research director for consumer devices at Current Analysis in New Jersey. “It (Nexus) was really not aimed at mainstream consumers,” Greengart says. “Based on their advertising campaign alone, it’s fairly clear that whatever they are announcing on the fourth will be aimed at mainstream consumers, if for no other reason than Google is spending a lot of money telling them about it.” Mobile is also the path Google is taking as it preps its new virtual reality platform called Daydream, foreshadowed at its May developer conference as a big move up from the Google Cardboard-based VR experience that helped consumers experience early VR at a low cost. Google has said it will release new headsets for Daydream that will work with powerful Android phones that have enough processing power to solve image delays. That arrangement would follow a similar model to Samsung’s Gear VR headsets that work with certain Samsung phones. The new platform puts Google into sharper competition with Facebook’s Oculus, the HTC Vive and Sony’s forthcoming PlayStation VR, due for release the week after Google’s big event. Stoking the competition between the two tech giants: Oculus has its own major developer event the following day on Oct. 5. In recent days, Facebook has faced some heat from software developers over Oculus founder Palmer Luckey’s financial backing of a pro-Donald Trump alt-right group that has smeared presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Oculus’ struggles could open a door for Google if Daydream lives up to the growing hype. Since announcing the virtual-reality platform earlier this year Google has provided few details on it. Another area of major interest: Google Home, the Amazon Echo rival smart-speaker. Whereas phones may be the emphasis for getting to users wherever they go, Home is the target for keeping them connected to Google when they are at home. By integrating the company’s artificial intelligence-powered Google Assistant, users can do everything from control Internet-connected lights, adjust thermostats or play music using nothing but their voice. Popularized by Amazon’s Echo, smart speakers have become the latest battleground for tech companies. Last week, Bloomberg reported that Apple was working on its own smart speaker powered by Siri, slated for next year. As with Daydream, Google has revealed few details on Home since showing it off briefly at I/O, raising plenty of questions on when it will arrive, how much it will cost and the functionality it will offer. Phones, virtual reality and smart speakers are the big expectations for Oct 4. But there’s more. Rumors over the past few weeks point to an updated Google Chromecast that will be capable of displaying higher resolution 4K content, an updated Wi-Fi router and potentially even a new Android tablet made by Huawei, who made last year’s Nexus 6P smartphone. Hardware isn’t everything, with reports this week pointing to Google introducing new software called Andromeda that will combine Android and the company’s Chrome OS that is found on laptops. The new software has the potential to unify Google’s software and may play a big role for the company going forward. Even so, analysts say none of these innovations would back up Lockheimer’s bold statement—at least not right away. “There is nothing that Google can have next week that will initially be seen as significant as the launch of Android does in hindsight,” says Jan Dawson, chief analyst at Jackdaw Research, noting that at its launch it wasn’t clear that Android would become as important as it has. And therein lies the risk to Google. “It’s dangerous,” Dawson says. “I think it’s inevitably going to seem disappointing. I think they would be better off just announcing what they are going to announce and letting people discover the significance over time.” RELATED: More Business stories on Thestar.com Read more about: Google The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.

The preview brings with it several major additions, including a Google Play Store for smartwatches, voice assistant functionality and Google’s Smart Reply feature. Android Wear 2.0 is set to be the biggest update to the OS since its launch in 2014, and clearly the company wants it to be fine-tuned before release. According to The Verge, Google states the reason for the delay is so the company “can hit the quality requirements it has for the platform when it is publicly launched and not because of specific hardware delays.” It also notes that all Android Wear devices currently on the market will support Android Wear 2.0 when the final version launches in 2017. Those who are comfortable with running beta software can install the third developer preview on their Android Wear watch by installing a beta version of the app on their phone, flashing their watch, then using the app to add a Google account to their watch. The steps are detailed in full here.

I was looking to get AW 2.0 and some of the newer features. Luckily I got my M360 from ebay and saved some $$. Not sure these devices are worth the MSRP $. Also, this gives Samsung time to get the Gear S3 out for the holiday season. Smanny Just out of curiosity why is it not a great experience? Are you comparing it to Tizen? What would make it better in your eyes? KiwiBri I got the watch a few days ago. Actually the battery life is way better than I expected. I just expected to have more integration from Googles own apps. I mean, there’s no calendar view. Theres an “adjenda” view of todays items, but you can’t look up the events for the week. There are third party apps that apparently can do this, but thats the problem I believe. You drop $$$ on this and expect more integration with the google environment/apps/. I haven’t used Tzien (I do have a Galaxy S7Edge, so I could well do now that the Gear S3 is on the way) So far, for reading basic txt msgs and controlling my spotify from the wrist its handy, but makes an expensive remote control. Luckily I got mine on ebay, so didnt take quite a big hit $CAD $240) purdy44 Yeah my biggest complaint is no Calendar view It’s Me Better that they take their time to do it right than to rush it. We’ve recently seen what happens when products are rushed. KiwiBri True. True. I Dont want them to abondon Android Wear. I’m sure it has potential purdy44 I bought a Fossil Q Marshall watch at the beginning of September and I love it. Never thought I’d actually get use out of a smartwatch, but I’m finding it quite handy (wristy?). A little bummed out that Android Wear 2.0 isn’t coming out this year, but reading about the new features I’m excited.

(Photo: Steve Jennings, Getty Images for TechCrunch) SAN FRANCISCO — Google has rebranded its business software business as Google Cloud. The Alphabet unit made the announcement at a press conference in San Francisco on Thursday. Google is playing catch up to competitors Amazon.com and Microsoft in cloud computing, the rapidly growing business in which the tech giants host other companies' digital businesses on their servers. Google for Work, Google's Cloud Platform and all of Google's cloud-based services will be combined under Google Cloud. USA TODAY Google's big cloud move sharpens rivalry with Amazon, Microsoft Forrester Research estimates that Amazon will generate $10.8 billion in cloud revenues this year,  Microsoft will generate $10.1 billion and Google will generate $3.9 billion. "The cloud partner that customers choose really matters. It amounts to picking which technology curve to bet on, and it’s a long-term bet, there's more to be had than cost savings and increased security," Google cloud chief Diane Greene wrote in a blog post. "Over the next five years, businesses of every kind will be transformed by smart data, analytics, machine learning and digital communications." USA TODAY Microsoft's LinkedIn buy escalates cloud wars Google's pitch: cloud technologies it is developing with "machine intelligence capabilities." Google also rebranded Google Apps for Work. Now known as GSsuite, these apps include Gmail, Docs, Drive and more for businesses. 8 CONNECTTWEET 9 LINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2dHpYHY

Most likely outcomes for Twitter: Google takeover, or stays independent. By Edmund Shing , Video by Sho Murakoshi September 29, 2016 18:32 BST Close Embed Feed Disney and Google join list of potential bidders for Twitter IBTimes UK <iframe src="http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/videos/embed/20883" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe> With Twitter (US code: TWTR) likely to follow Linkedin into the arms of a tech giant with deep pockets, the question is: who's next on the shopping list of tech behemoths like Google, Apple and Microsoft? To recap: the business-focused social networking company Linkedin (LNKD) was bought up by Microsoft earlier this year for $26.2bn (Chart 1), while the core business of former internet pioneer Yahoo! (YHOO) was snapped up by US telecom company Verizon for $4.8bn. Chart 1: Linkedin surged earlier this year on Microsoft’s buyoutSource: investing.com On Friday, Twitter's share price surged by over 17% to over $23 per share (Chart 2) on the back of rumours that either Google or Salesforce.com were about to bid for the company. Chart 2: Twitter’s share price surges on takeover talkSource: investing.com This is a classic case of an industry in the throes of consolidation: that is, fewer and fewer large companies buy up smaller rivals in order to dominate the business landscape. In this case, we can see that the internet landscape in being increasingly dominated by Google, Facebook and Microsoft. Let's take a quick look at each of the mooted bidders for Twitter, and examine why they might find Twitter an interesting business to absorb. Chart 3: Facebook and Google (Youtube) dominate US social media: Twitter #4Source: statista.com Google/Alphabet (GOOGL): Beef up social networking footprint given Google+ also-ran status Why would Google be interested in buying up Twitter, to add to its stable of internet-related acquisitions such as Youtube (online video), Doubleclick and Admob (both in online advertising)? Well, let's start with the obvious. Google has singularly failed to compete effectively with Facebook in the social media space, allowing Facebook to dominate. Buying up Twitter would be one way for Google to grow its social media footprint massively in one go. The main revenues at Twitter come in the form of advertising revenues: well one thing is clear, that Google is a market leader in the online advertising space, and so could certainly find growth from synergies with Google's existing online ad businesses, including of course Youtube. Financing a potential buyout of Twitter at, let's say, $26 per share which was Twitters IPO price and well above the current $23-odd level would cost around $19bn. For a company of Google's size and considerable power, who have over $78bn in the bank currently, even a $19bn should not prove too heavy a burden, representing less than 4% of the value of Google. Salesforce.com (CRM) – a second suitor from the online software space Salesforce.com is an online business software company that operates Customer Relationship Management software for its business clients. This is basically an online database where a company's employees can store their notes about all discussions between themselves and their various clients, track the amount of client contact that employees have and thus measure their productivity. Twitter would be a much bigger morsel for salesforce.com to swallow, given that $19bn would represent nearly 40% of Salesforce.com's current size. Twitter has what is potentially a very valuable user database that Salesforce.com could exploit in their own business; but it is difficult to see them competing on price with Google, given the tech giant's hugely superior financial muscle. Microsoft (MSFT): still absorbing Linkedin Microsoft is another technology giant that, like Google, has struggled to reach critical mass in the consumer internet space, with its search engine Bing notably struggling to compete with market leader Google. In addition, Microsoft is still in the process of absorbing business-focused social media pioneer Linkedin, which cost Microsoft a hefty $26bn just recently. The fit between business software leader Microsoft and Linkedin is obvious to see, given Linkedin's focus on business social networks. So it is difficult to see the Redmond, Seattle-based software gorilla taking another big bite in the social media space just yet, given the risks of indigestion. Disney (DIS): Does this make sense? Last but not least, the US TV and film giant Disney has expressed interest in buying Twitter. The reasoning behind such interest is perhaps hard to see at first. It perhaps becomes a little clearer when you consider that Twitter recently broadcast NFL American Football night games over the internet, a business that Disney's ESPN TV sports division knows very well. Add in the fact that Twitter's founder, Jack Dorsey, sits on Disney's board of directors, and the reasons for Disney potentially bidding for Twitter become somewhat clearer. Financing for such a deal is quite doable for Disney too, given a relatively low debt-load. But the real question is whether Disney, a traditional media player, is well-equipped to get the best out of this social media player. Previous internet and media marriages have ended in messy divorce in the past – just think of the AOL/Time Warner merger back in the heady days of 2000 or News Corp. buying up Myspace (where is Myspace today?). For that reason, I don't think a successful Disney bid is likely. Most likely outcomes for Twitter: Google takeover, or stays independent In my humble opinion, the most likely outcomes for the loss-making Twitter are the following: Google pays between $26 and $30 per share to buy Twitter in a deal agreed by the Twitter management; Twitter rejects all takeover offers and decides to continue to go it alone, resulting in a share price drop of up to 40% from current levels. Two final questions: who else could be bought, and what can investors buy? Chart 4: StubHub is growing sales fastSource: marketrealist.com Which internet company could be the next in line to be bought up by a bigger player? I would look at eBay which – post spin-off of the Paypal division into a separately-listed company – is now a cheap internet company, with valuable growth in the form of Stubhub, an online sales platform for concert, sports and theatre tickets (Chart 4). Otherwise, I still believe that the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index in the US is worth investing in, to capture the growth in all these businesses. This can be accessed in the UK with the Powershares EQQQ Nasdaq 100 UCITS ETF (UK code EQQQ).

Anytime. Anywhere. NEWS OPS By Ben Jacobs. Updated September 29, 2016 9:33AM SHARE ALSO SEE Donald Trump Google Election Politics Government Hillary Clinton Donald Trump has gone on the offensive after his underwhelming debate performance by criticizing debate moderator Lester Holt as biased and accusing Google of a conspiracy to rig search results in favor of Hillary Clinton. He also had surrogates attack his Democrat rival for her husband’s infidelities while suggesting she wants to “strip [the United States] of its status as a sovereign nation”. The Republican nominee [pictured above] launched the latest salvo of attacks in an interview with Fox News’s Bill O’Reilly where he claimed Holt “was much, much tougher on me than he was on Hillary”. Trump said that while initially “I said good things right after the show” he had changed his mind about Holt’s performance “after seeing the way he badgered and even the questions I got”. In particular, Trump expressed his discontent over the fact that Holt asked him “the birther question” in Monday’s debate. The Republican nominee had long falsely claimed that President Barack Obama was not born in the United States, an accusation widely considered to be a racist dogwhistle. Although Trump only recently acknowledged that Obama was born in the United States in an event at a Washington hotel, he falsely blamed Hillary Clinton for the conspiracy theory’s origin. He since said that he only acknowledged Obama’s actual birthplace in order to “get on with the campaign”. Trump also introduced a new conspiracy theory to the campaign on Wednesday night when he accused Google of somehow colluding with Hillary Clinton’s campaign. “Google search engine was suppressing the bad news about Hillary Clinton,” the Republican told a cheering crowd of supporters in Waukesha, Wisconsin. Neither Google nor the Trump campaign responded to requests for comment on this accusation, which seems to stem from a report in Sputnik News, a Russian state propaganda outlet. Also, at the rally, Trump unveiled a new accusation towards Clinton, whom he has repeatedly attacked as “a globalist”, by saying she was a “vessel for special interests... who want to strip [the United States] of its status as a sovereign nation”. Although the former secretary of state has long favored immigration reform as well as number of free trade agreements, there is no evidence that she has ever supported stripping the United States of its sovereignty. However, Clinton is facing scrutiny over her complicated marital history. After Trump publicly congratulated himself for not bringing up former President Bill Clinton’s past infidelities in Monday’s debate, his campaign has cited them in talking points in an attempt to rebut past crude statements about a beauty queen. The statements about former Miss Universe Alicia Machado, which included calling her “Miss Piggy” for her weight and “Miss Housekeeping” in reference to her Hispanic heritage, were brought up by Hillary Clinton in Monday’s debate. Trump owned part of the Miss Universe pageant at the time. In talking points distributed to Trump surrogates on the topic, they were told to change the topic to Monica Lewinsky and included the line “Mr. Trump has never treated women the way Hillary Clinton and her husband did when they actively worked to destroy Bill Clinton’s accusers.” In interviews on Wednesday, Trump surrogates repeatedly brought the subject up. Trump himself tried to cast himself as an ally of Machado in an interview with O’Reilly. He repeatedly said “I saved her job” and added in seeming regret: “I helped somebody and this is what you get for helping somebody.” Clinton spent the day campaigning with former rival Bernie Sanders in New Hampshire. The two tried to appeal to millennial voters by repeatedly touting Clinton’s proposal to reduce the cost of college tuition. Clinton is facing declining enthusiasm among millennial voters who were one of the key groups in the winning coalition forged by Obama in his election victories. According to a recent poll conducted by ABC/Washington Post only 49% of voters under the age of 40 said they were likely to vote in November. A similar poll in 2012 put that number at 71%. The Democratic nominee also held two fundraisers on Wednesday, one of which featured an appearance from Massachusetts senator and progressive, Elizabeth Warren. The leading third party alternative to Clinton and Trump suffered his own embarrassment on Wednesday. Gary Johnson, the Libertarian nominee for the White House, was unable to name a single foreign leader he admired in an interview with MSNBC’s Chris Matthews. He referred to his inability to come up with a single name as “another Aleppo moment.” This was a reference to a televised interview several weeks ago when the former two-term governor of New Mexico came up empty when asked “what is Aleppo?” on MSNBC’s Morning Joe. Johnson seemed unaware of the Syrian city which has been long under siege in the midst of that country’s civil war and the site of numerous atrocities by the Assad regime and its allies. The candidates will return to the campaign trail on Thursday by meeting voters in states that they are long familiar with from the primaries. Clinton is holding an event in Iowa while Trump returns to the trail in New Hampshire. © 2016 Guardian Web syndicated under contract with NewsEdge. All rights reserved.

Miriam Rivera Contributor Co-Founder and Managing Partner at Ulu Ventures, Kauffman Fellow September 29, 2016 It’s incredible that it took just 18 years for Google -- the company reached this milestone of adulthood on Sept. 27 -- to create a market capitalization of more than $530 billion. It’s perhaps even more amazing to recall how the search engine has changed life as we know it. Google, now a unit of holding parent company Alphabet Inc., began in Larry Page and Sergey Brin’s Stanford University dorm in 1998 before campus officials asked them to find a real office after the Stanford IT department complained Page and Brin’s were sucking up all the university’s bandwidth. By the time I joined the company in November of 2001, it was apparent that we were changing the world. As an early employee at Google -- the second attorney hired there -- there were times when shivers ran up my spine thinking about what we were building. Democratizing access to information, and bringing the real world online -- it was an inspiring place to be. Related: Inspirational Quotes From 12 Current and Former Googlers Having grown up in a working class neighborhood, I had to travel to an affluent neighborhood to access a good public library, spending countless Saturday afternoons with volumes of reference books to learn how to apply for financial aid to attend college. In those pre-Internet days, a good library and a kind-hearted librarian were my keys to advancement. After the printing press, the first major democratization of access to information had been driven a century ago by steel baron Andrew Carnegie. He became the world’s richest man in the late 19th century and then gave it all away, donating $60 million to fund 1,689 public libraries across the United States. To my mind, Google took Carnegie’s vision of putting information in the hands of the general public and put it on steroids, creating a virtual library akin to those found only in sci-fi movies in 1998. Google indexed the internet extraordinarily well without human intervention, unlike previously curated outlets such as Yahoo! or LexisNexis, and in such a way that the user did not have to know how to use the index or Boolean search methods. Google enabled free searches of words or terms, making all manner of information instantly retrievable even if you did not know where it was housed. With Google, you could find any needle in any haystack at any time. Unlocking that data has indeed been a great equalizer: any individual can arm him or herself with relevant information before seeing a doctor or applying for government assistance, housing or a job. Related: 5 Years Later, Google+ Is a Forgettable Product Worth Remembering Getting archives online Soon, Google could trivially retrieve any piece of data on the World Wide Web. Crucially, Google started indexing information that was previously offline, such as far-flung archives (imagine a very old text in a tower in Salamanca) to make that knowledge searchable. People’s photos and videos followed. Then, of course, Google cars began cruising and mapping our streets. That paired with GPS granted us all a new superpower -- being able to find our way in almost any small town or big city in the world. Now Google is a global archive storing our history as it is made. It is as though a virtual world is being created right alongside our real world, a simulation of reality that grows more robust by the day. Because of Google, the creation and storage of information itself has expanded exponentially as people and scholars have access to information that enables them to make new discoveries. Those discoveries, in turn, are shared with the world thanks to the culture of sharing that has been central to the internet and Google’s philosophy. All this has sped the pace of discovery. Of course, there have been casualties. Google has changed the business of newspapers forever and virtually single-handedly run most publishers of maps out of business. It transformed advertising, using and perfecting A/B testing to understanding our tastes and what makes a person click on an ad. Sometimes I worry that technology companies have become almost too good at this, building upon and applying these lessons to other ways of collectively sucking us into our devices more and more. This access to information without the curation of trained journalists carries other costs too, leading to an internet rife with misinformation and untruth. Nowhere is that more evident today than in our rancorous U.S. presidential election, where it seems little value is placed on objectivity, making organizations such as factcheck.org essential reading. The growth of Google and the diminution of the role of the established media in our society at such crucial moments might cause Alexis de Tocqueville, who believed newspapers “maintain civilization,” to turn in his grave.

Autonomous cars, robots, gesture-sensing fabrics, hands-free controls, modular cell phones and reimagined cities are among the projects that lie ahead for the search giant that even as it is one of the world’s largest companies, has maintained a startup culture at its offices, which now employ more than 61,000 people. In breaking out beyond the constraints of the online world into the physical universe, Google has made us believe (and even expect) that when one is inspired by some great purpose, we can transcend limitations. Anything becomes possible.

The app’s goal is to take the work out of planning a fulfilling trip, and to do so, it taps into the mobile mindset of its modern users. Google hopes travelers who are used to using apps like Uber while on the go will find a familiar ease of use in Google Trips, which is available on iOS and Android. Since most vacationers want to maximize the limited amount of time they have to spend at their dream destination, the app aids users in planning each day of their trip with the help of customizable day planners tailored to 200 major world cities. The “personalized tour guide” on the app pulls together the most popular attractions at a destination and curates individual itinerary suggestions that might have a user spending a day touring the sights in an artsy neighborhood, for example. Travelers can also build their own day plans based around whatever attraction they consider a must-see: the app will jump into a map view when the user inputs the sight that’s most essential to their trip, and will then suggest nearby popular sights. You can even tell the app whether you have just a few hours to spend in the area or whether your whole day is open. Each trip logged on Google Trips will include the user’s itinerary, as well as reservation information, local food and drink suggestions and more. The app automatically pulls data from the user’s Gmail and organizes it into individual trips, eliminating the need for travelers to hunt down each flight confirmation and hotel reservation in their inbox. Each trip can be fully downloaded for use offline, a plus for users with strict data limits.

Resend activation e-mail Gear & Gadgets / Product News & Reviews Google pushes Android Wear 2.0 back to 2017, issues third developer beta Wear version of Google Play allows app downloads directly from the watch. by Andrew Cunningham - Sep 29, 2016 5:00 pm UTC Login to bookmark 37 Google Android Wear 2.0 watches. Google Android Wear 2.0 watches. Google A rainbow of supported watches, including a few recent and soon-to-be-launched models. Google Android Wear 2.0. Google Android Wear 2.0. Google announced Android Wear 2.0 alongside what later became Android Nougat at Google I/O a few months ago, but aside from a second Wear 2.0 developer preview build in July, we haven't heard much since. There's good and bad news on that front: the good news is that Google is releasing a third Wear 2.0 developer preview today with some new features and tweaks. The bad news is that the final release of the software is being delayed. Wear 2.0's release date has been pushed back from a vague "this fall" window to an equally vague "early 2017" window, presumably so Google can keep testing and tweaking. To that end, Google will release a fourth developer preview build, and the 2.0 update will begin trickling out to supported watches after that. The biggest addition to the Android Wear Developer Preview 4 is a watch version of the Google Play store that can browse and download watch apps and watch faces without your phone—developers told Google that they wanted watch apps to be easier to find, and this is Google's answer. Text entry still looks painful, and relatively wimpy watch hardware may slow things down, but if the eventual goal is to make watches that can operate independently of phones, this is an important step. Searching for apps on a watch. That tiny keyboard still seems... fun. Google The watch-exclusive store also means that developers can release watch apps that are totally independent of phone apps. Historically, Wear apps have been bundled in standard phone apps—download a phone app, and then the wearable app would be downloaded to the watch from the phone. Apps can still be downloaded and installed this way, but as of Wear 2.0 it will no longer be strictly necessary. Other tweaks in the new preview build include permission requests for watch complications, a "recycler view" that lets developers display vertical lists of items in a way that will look good on square and round watch faces (the Wear 2.0 app picker uses the same view), and inline actions for new notifications (you would previously need to swipe down on a notification to expose a quick action menu). Whether your new watch will receive Wear 2.0 is going to be up to its manufacturer, at least in part. The LGE Watch Urbane 2nd Edition and Huawei Watch are safe bets since they're still the only devices you can use to test these preview builds, but we already know that early Wear watches like the LG G Watch and first-generation Moto 360 will be missing out.

The company announced today that it is delaying the launch of the update, which was originally scheduled for this fall, to sometime in early 2017. Instead of launching the final version this fall, Google is extending the developer preview program for Android Wear 2.0, and today it’s releasing the third preview of the platform for developers. The company says that it is using the extra time to fine tune the software via feedback from developers, and it will have another preview build released before the end of the year. Today’s version adds a number of new features, most notable of which is the Play Store for smartwatches. The Play Store for Android Wear 2.0 will let smartwatch owners browse and download apps and watchfaces directly to their watches, without having to install them on their phones. It’s a big part of Google’s pitch to make Android Wear 2.0 less dependent on phones and more of an independent platform. It also will allow iOS users to install third-party watchfaces and apps on an Android Wear watch, which was previously limited to Android only. (The Play Store on Android Wear with iOS is not yet supported in this version, Google says that will come in a later developer preview.) Google The Play Store on Android Wear 2.0 Android Wear 2.0’s Play Store will work when the watch is connected to a phone over Bluetooth or when it’s connected to a Wi-Fi or cellular network (on devices with cellular connectivity). Purchases for paid apps will need to be authenticated on the phone with this version, though Google says it plans to eliminate that requirement with future versions. In addition to the Play Store, this developer preview, which can be installed on the Huawei Watch and the LG Watch Urbane 2nd Edition LTE, adds voice assistant functionality (was missing from earlier builds); better user interface elements for round displays; improvements to complications and permissions; inline actions for notifications; and Google’s Smart Reply feature. Smart Reply is part of Google’s larger Assistant platform and provides contextual replies for incoming messages. Google says that Allo and Hangouts are already using it and developers will be able to enable it in their apps with this build. Google says that the delay for the launch of Android Wear 2.0 is so that the company can hit the quality requirements it has for the platform when it is publicly launched and not because of specific hardware delays. Though major Android Wear partners such as Motorola, Huawei, and LG have said they won’t be launching any more Wear smartwatches this year, Google points to recent devices from Asus, Fossil, Michael Kors, Polar, and Nixon as evidence of the vibrancy of the platform. Google says that all of the devices launching this fall will support Android Wear 2.0 when the final version is available next year. Android Wear devices from Asus, Fossil, Michael Kors, Nixon, and Polar that launched this fall Google Still, with the delay of Android Wear 2.0 and the absence of new devices from the tech companies Google’s worked with in the past, Google is ceding the lucrative holiday season to Apple and Samsung, which already have a sizable lead over Android Wear in the smartwatch market. Android Wear 2.0 is the biggest update to Google’s smartwatch platform since its original launch in 2014 and it promises to be really interesting and potentially useful. But in order to do that, it has to first arrive.

At the same time, though, the company also today said that it will continue the preview program into early 2017. While Google never talked about a final release date for Wear 2.0, its original schedule called for about 30 weeks of alpha and beta testing, which would have put the release date somewhere around the middle of December. Google, however, now says that it has gotten “tons of great feedback from the developer community about Android Wear 2.0” and that it is “committed to improve and iterate based on them to ensure a great user experience.” Because of this, the plan is to continue the preview program into early 2017 at which time the first watches will receive the new version. Google did not go into details about the kind of feedback it has received and why this means the release date had to be pushed back. It’s no secret, though, that we won’t see all that many new Android Wear watches come to market in the next few months. This probably puts even more pressure on Google to make the second version of its smartwatch OS a hit. Outside of a small contingent of tech enthusiasts, smartwatches still mostly remain a novelty, after all. The marquee feature of this release is the launch of Google Play on Android Wear. The Play Store for Android Wear allows users to install apps directly on the watch. With the 2.0 update, watches don’t need to be paired with a phone, so users will be able to simply use the Play Store on the web, find apps they want to install to their watches and bypass their phone completely. Developers can now build and publish these Android Wear 2.0 apps and make them discoverable in Google Play. With this update, Google also is introducing a number of other new features it had already announced at its I/O developer conference but hadn’t shipped in earlier previews. These include support for smart replies and a new API that allows users to take actions on notifications right from the notifications stream (which works similarly to notifications in Android Nougat). 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Google Founded 1998 Overview Google is a multinational corporation that is specialized in internet-related services and products.

Google combines all of its cloud services under the ‘Google Cloud’ brand Posted Sep 29, 2016 by Frederic Lardinois (@fredericl) 0 SHARES Next Story Rocketspace and Alchemist accelerator partner up to go international Google for Work, Google’s Cloud Platform and the rest of the company’s cloud-based services are getting a new name. They have now been combined under the “Google Cloud” moniker. Google’s Diane Greene made the announcement at a small invite-only event in San Francisco. If you’ve been following along, today’s news doesn’t come as a total surprise. The Information previously reported that this change was in the works. And just to confuse us, Google is also rebranding Google Apps for Work, which also falls under the Google Cloud umbrella. Google Apps for Work is now the G Suite (not sure I love that name, but I guess we’ll get used to it…). The Google for Work/Google Cloud moniker encompassed a broad range of product, including core productivity apps like Gmail, Google Docs, Sheets and Slides, as well as niche offerings like Google Maps for Work and the Google Search for Work appliance. But it also includes the Google Cloud Platform cloud computing platform, Chromebooks, and Google’s enterprise mobility services. As Greene noted during her keynote this morning, Google first considered the name Google Enterprise and used it both internally and externally for a while. Greene said the reason for that was that when she joined Google earlier this year, the company’s customers were still not sure whether Google was serious about the cloud, so the name seemed like a good fit. Now, however, potential customers know that Google is serious about enterprise, she argued. “Enterprise — that was so June,” Greene said. “We are the full power of Google in the Cloud. We are Google Cloud. It’s uniquely Google — a broad set of technologies, solutions and products.”     0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Google Founded 1998 Overview Google is a multinational corporation that is specialized in internet-related services and products.

Donald Trump's latest conspiracy theory takes on Google 0 Share: Tech Culture by Alfred Ng September 29, 2016 8:17 AM PDT @alfredwkng Up Next President Obama slams fake news for eroding democracy Enlarge Image Donald Trump at a rally in Council Bluffs, Iowa, this week.Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images Donald Trump is again accusing Google of bias against his campaign. Two days after the first presidential debate between the Republican candidate and his Election 2016 rival, Hillary Clinton, Trump slammed the tech giant, saying negative stories on Clinton weren't showing up in Google search results. "The Google poll has us leading Hillary Clinton by two points nationwide, and that's despite the fact that Google's search engine was suppressing the bad news about Hillary Clinton. How about that?" Trump said during a rally in Wisconsin on Wednesday. This marks the second time Trump has charged Google with unfair treatment, and it's yet another incident in which he's seized on technology as an issue. Trump has also called for Apple to start building its products in the US and has supported Ted Cruz's quest to maintain US control over internet domain naming rights. Trump's campaign did not respond to requests for comment on what "bad news" the candidate was referring to. In the same speech in which Trump accused Google of burying negative stories, he discussed Clinton's "deplorables" remarks, her controversial "superpredators" statement and her email scandal, and he urged his supporters to "follow the money," criticizing her campaign contributors. But Google has never reranked search results, and it prioritizes the most relevant stories, according to a person familiar with the company's methods. Indeed, all the stories Trump referenced in his speech appeared within the first five results produced by a Google search. Google's search works by scraping the web for content, then using algorithms to rank results according to more than 200 factors, including a website's page quality and relevance, according to the company. Searches spiked during Monday's debate showdown, as users flocked to the search engine to fact-check the candidates. "Trump Iraq war" was searched up to 137 times as much as "Clinton emails" was looked up. Trump has blamed Google for his troubles in the past, after a SourceFed video in June accused the search engine of manipulating search results in favor of Clinton. Google responded to those previous claims, saying the people making them "simply misunderstand how Autocomplete works." Google's Autocomplete algorithm, which gives suggested search terms once you've started typing in a query, doesn't populate any negative terms when paired with a person's name, the company explained. That means "Hillary Clinton cri" doesn't autocomplete to "crime," and the same logic would apply to "Donald Trump cri." The search engine giant has treated the 2016 election as if it were kryptonite. Google's executive chairman, Eric Schmidt, has said the company will remain neutral during the heated 2016 election campaign.

Follow TechnoBuffalo Google Maps is an invaluable service for navigating cities and towns, and a new update is making it even better with the addition of voice commands. Now, Google Maps truly is your co-pilot. An update on Thursday for Android adds navigation-specific commands that make getting around town a breeze. If you’re unsure when to turn next, just ask Maps. Want to know what traffic is like on your route home? All you have to do is ask. There are several voice commands specific to directions and travel—you can even throw in more general commands (call Mom) right from the Maps interface. In the update, there’s a new “While driving” toggle that will enable voice commands while Maps is open. With the feature turned on, simply say, “Ok Google,” followed by your command of choice. The convenience of the feature is obvious; you’ll no longer have to take your eyes off the road in order to fiddle with the app. Just say a command and it’ll provide the relevant information. The new feature is specific to Android and should be available as an update right now. Below is a cheat sheet of commands you can use the next time you travel. Directions and travel “Mute.” or “Mute voice guidance.” “Unmute.” or “Unmute voice guidance.” “Show traffic.” or “Hide traffic.” “Show satellite.” or “Hide satellite.” “Navigate home.” or “Navigate to Starbucks.” “Show route overview.” or “Show alternate routes.” “What road is this?” “What’s my next turn?” “What’s my ETA?” “How’s traffic ahead?” or “How’s traffic to home?” “What’s the weather like?” “Avoid tolls.” or “Enable tolls.” “Avoid highways.” or “Enable highways.” “Avoid ferries.” or “Enable ferries.” “Exit navigation.” More commands you can say “Call Mom.” “Find gas stations.” or “Find restaurants.” “Send a text to Larry.” or “Send a SMS to Sergey, I’m feeling lucky.” “What’s the weather like?” or “How’s the weather in Seattle?” “Play some jazz.” or “Play happy birthday on Google Play Music.” “What’s the closest hotel?” “When’s my next meeting?” Source GoogleMaps Topics #Google #Google #Google Maps Brandon Russell Brandon Russell enjoys writing about technology and entertainment.

Register for an Exam Today> Trump Calls Lester Holt 'Biased', Accuses Google of Conspiracy By Ben Jacobs PUBLISHED: SEPTEMBER 29 2016 Donald Trump has gone on the offensive after his underwhelming debate performance by criticizing debate moderator Lester Holt as biased and accusing Google of a conspiracy to rig search results in favor of Hillary Clinton. He also had surrogates attack his Democrat rival for her husband’s infidelities while suggesting she wants to “strip [the United States] of its status as a sovereign nation”. The Republican nominee [pictured above] launched the latest salvo of attacks in an interview with Fox News’s Bill O’Reilly where he claimed Holt “was much, much tougher on me than he was on Hillary”. Trump said that while initially “I said good things right after the show” he had changed his mind about Holt’s performance “after seeing the way he badgered and even the questions I got”. In particular, Trump expressed his discontent over the fact that Holt asked him “the birther question” in Monday’s debate. The Republican nominee had long falsely claimed that President Barack Obama was not born in the United States, an accusation widely considered to be a racist dogwhistle. Although Trump only recently acknowledged that Obama was born in the United States in an event at a Washington hotel, he falsely blamed Hillary Clinton for the conspiracy theory’s origin. He since said that he only acknowledged Obama’s actual birthplace in order to “get on with the campaign”. Trump also introduced a new conspiracy theory to the campaign on Wednesday night when he accused Google of somehow colluding with Hillary Clinton’s campaign. “Google search engine was suppressing the bad news about Hillary Clinton,” the Republican told a cheering crowd of supporters in Waukesha, Wisconsin. Neither Google nor the Trump campaign responded to requests for comment on this accusation, which seems to stem from a report in Sputnik News, a Russian state propaganda outlet. Also, at the rally, Trump unveiled a new accusation towards Clinton, whom he has repeatedly attacked as “a globalist”, by saying she was a “vessel for special interests... who want to strip [the United States] of its status as a sovereign nation”. Although the former secretary of state has long favored immigration reform as well as number of free trade agreements, there is no evidence that she has ever supported stripping the United States of its sovereignty. However, Clinton is facing scrutiny over her complicated marital history. After Trump publicly congratulated himself for not bringing up former President Bill Clinton’s past infidelities in Monday’s debate, his campaign has cited them in talking points in an attempt to rebut past crude statements about a beauty queen. The statements about former Miss Universe Alicia Machado, which included calling her “Miss Piggy” for her weight and “Miss Housekeeping” in reference to her Hispanic heritage, were brought up by Hillary Clinton in Monday’s debate. Trump owned part of the Miss Universe pageant at the time. In talking points distributed to Trump surrogates on the topic, they were told to change the topic to Monica Lewinsky and included the line “Mr. Trump has never treated women the way Hillary Clinton and her husband did when they actively worked to destroy Bill Clinton’s accusers.” In interviews on Wednesday, Trump surrogates repeatedly brought the subject up. Trump himself tried to cast himself as an ally of Machado in an interview with O’Reilly. He repeatedly said “I saved her job” and added in seeming regret: “I helped somebody and this is what you get for helping somebody.” Clinton spent the day campaigning with former rival Bernie Sanders in New Hampshire. The two tried to appeal to millennial voters by repeatedly touting Clinton’s proposal to reduce the cost of college tuition. Clinton is facing declining enthusiasm among millennial voters who were one of the key groups in the winning coalition forged by Obama in his election victories. According to a recent poll conducted by ABC/Washington Post only 49% of voters under the age of 40 said they were likely to vote in November. A similar poll in 2012 put that number at 71%. The Democratic nominee also held two fundraisers on Wednesday, one of which featured an appearance from Massachusetts senator and progressive, Elizabeth Warren. The leading third party alternative to Clinton and Trump suffered his own embarrassment on Wednesday. Gary Johnson, the Libertarian nominee for the White House, was unable to name a single foreign leader he admired in an interview with MSNBC’s Chris Matthews. He referred to his inability to come up with a single name as “another Aleppo moment.” This was a reference to a televised interview several weeks ago when the former two-term governor of New Mexico came up empty when asked “what is Aleppo?” on MSNBC’s Morning Joe. Johnson seemed unaware of the Syrian city which has been long under siege in the midst of that country’s civil war and the site of numerous atrocities by the Assad regime and its allies. The candidates will return to the campaign trail on Thursday by meeting voters in states that they are long familiar with from the primaries.

SUBSCRIBE The myth of the duplicate content penalty There is a lot of confusion surrounding how Google handles duplicate content, but columnist Patrick Stox aims to clear it up once and for all. Patrick Stox on September 29, 2016 at 9:50 am More Many people are more afraid of duplicate content than they are of spammy links. There are so many myths around duplicate content that people actually think it causes a penalty and that their pages will compete against each other and hurt their website. I see forum posts, Reddit threads, technical audits, tools, and even SEO news websites publishing articles that show people clearly don’t understand how Google treats duplicate content. Google tried to kill off the myths around duplicate content years ago. Susan Moska posted on the Google Webmaster blog in 2008: Let’s put this to bed once and for all, folks: There’s no such thing as a “duplicate content penalty.” At least, not in the way most people mean when they say that. You can help your fellow webmasters by not perpetuating the myth of duplicate content penalties! Sorry we failed you, Susan. What is duplicate content? According to Google: Duplicate content generally refers to substantive blocks of content within or across domains that either completely match other content or are appreciably similar. Mostly, this is not deceptive in origin. People mistake duplicate content for a penalty because of how Google handles it. Really, the duplicates are just being filtered in the search results. You can see this for yourself by adding &filter=0 to the end of the URL and removing the filtering. Adding &filter=0 to the end of the page URL on a search for “raleigh seo meetup” will show me the exact same page twice. I’m not saying Meetup has done a good job with this, since they actually indicate the two versions (HTTP and HTTPS in this case) are both correct in their use of canonical tags, but I think it does show that the exact same page (or similar pages) are actually indexed, and only the most relevant is being shown. It’s not that the page is necessarily competing or doing any harm to the website itself. How much of the web is duplicated? According to Matt Cutts, 25 to 30 percent of the web is duplicate content. A recent study by Raven Tools based on data from their site auditor tool found a similar result, in that 29 percent of pages had duplicate content. What are Google’s thoughts on duplicate content? Many great posts have been published by Googlers. I’m going to give you a summary of the best parts, but I recommend reading over the posts as well. Duplicate content doesn’t cause your site to be penalized. Googlers know that users want diversity in the search results and not the same article over and over, so they choose to consolidate and show only one version. Google actually designed algorithms to prevent duplicate content from affecting webmasters. These algorithms group the various versions into a cluster, the “best” URL in the cluster is displayed, and they actually consolidate various signals (such as links) from pages within that cluster to the one being shown. They even went as far as saying, “If you don’t want to worry about sorting through duplication on your site, you can let us worry about it instead.” Duplicate content is not grounds for action unless its intent is to manipulate search results. About the worst thing that can happen from this filtering is that a less desirable version of the page will be shown in search results. Google tries to determine the original source of the content and display that one. If someone is duplicating your content without permission, you can request to have it removed by filing a request under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. Do not block access to duplicate content. If they can’t crawl all the versions, they can’t consolidate the signals. Sources: Deftly dealing with duplicate content Duplicate content due to scrapers Google, duplicate content caused by URL parameters, and you Duplicate content summit at SMX Advanced Learn the impact of duplicate URLs Duplicate content (Search Console Help) Causes of duplicate content HTTP and HTTPS www and non-www Parameters and faceted navigation Session IDs Trailing slashes Index pages Alternate page versions such as m. or AMP pages or print Dev/hosting environments Pagination Scrapers Country/language versions Solutions to duplicate content The solution will depend on the particular situation: Do nothing and hope Google gets it right. While I wouldn’t recommend this course of action, you may have read previously that Google will cluster the pages and consolidate the signals, effectively handling duplicate content issues for you. Canonical tags. These tags are used to consolidate signals and pick your preferred version. It’s a pet peeve of mine when a website has canonical tags set correctly and I see an audit that says there are duplicate content issues. It’s not an issue at that point, so don’t say that it is. 301 redirects. This would prevent pages from even having most duplication issues by preventing some alternate versions from being displayed. Tell Google how to handle URL parameters. Setting these up tells Google what the parameters are actually doing instead of letting them try to figure it out. Rel=”alternate”. Used to consolidate alternate versions of a page, such as mobile or various country/language pages. With country/language in particular, hreflang is used to show the correct country/language page in the search results. A few months ago, Google’s John Mueller, answering a question in the Webmaster Hangout, said that fixing hreflang wouldn’t increase rankings but would only help the correct version show. This is likely because Google has already identified the alternate versions and consolidated the signals for the different pages. Rel=”prev” and rel=”next”. Used for pagination. Follow syndication best practices. TL;DR There are some things that could actually cause problems, such as scraping/spam, but for the most part, problems would be caused by the websites themselves. Don’t disallow in robots.txt, don’t nofollow, don’t noindex, don’t canonical from pages targeting longer-tail to overview-type pages, but do use the signals mentioned above for your particular issues to indicate how you want the content to be treated. Check out Google’s help section on duplicate content. Myths about duplicate content penalties need to die. Audits, tools and misunderstandings need correct information, or this myth might be around for another 10 years. There are plenty of ways to consolidate signals across multiple pages, and even if you don’t use them, Google will try to consolidate the signals for you.

SUBSCRIBE Prepping SEO for 2017: it’s all about the ROI Tracking return on investment from SEO can be tricky, especially since it often assists other marketing channels. But columnist Janet Driscoll Miller lays out a plan for proving organic search's ROI and securing budget for the next fiscal year. Janet Driscoll Miller on September 29, 2016 at 10:16 am More Fall is in the air, and that can only mean one thing for most digital marketers: budget season. The approaching fourth quarter is often the time when companies begin the budget and planning process for the next fiscal year. And it seems that ROI, while always considered a top priority, has renewed importance now. Advertising Age recently reported that intense demand for ROI is causing companies to replace their CMOs at a rapid rate — as much as a 48-percent turnover in top retailers. You’d think that ROI would be easy to track on digital, right? Compared to offline media, digital clearly has a tracking advantage. But integrating tracking correctly can be difficult, especially for what may be influencing channels and not the final purchase channel, which can be the case at times for organic search and SEO. So what’s the answer? How do you integrate SEO into the tracking mix and prove the organic search channel’s ROI? How you’ll track ROI may differ based on the tools and data you have access to in your organization. Determine your attribution model If your organization hasn’t yet determined the attribution model to use, that’s where you’ll need to start. The attribution model is the basis for allocating credit to each marketing channel. There is no correct or incorrect attribution model or one that applies to all organizations. Each model is different, and you’ll need to decide which model best fits your business. The most common attribution models are single-source attribution, measuring first touch or last touch. First-touch, as the name implies, gives all credit to the first channel or lead source that brought the customer or lead to your website. The first-touch channel is recorded and then never changed. By contrast, the last-touch attribution model credits the last channel the customer or lead used to come to your website. The last-touch channel is always updating as the customer or lead continues to interact with your site over time. In part, these attribution models are most common because many measurement tools, like marketing automation or CRM (customer relationship management), often only have one field to store attribution data. Unfortunately, first- or last-touch attribution essentially ignores all of the channels that may have influenced a customer or lead in the process. If you want to use a model that gives some level of credit to all channels that may have influenced along the way, consider a fractional attribution model, such as linear or time decay. Linear attribution credits all influencing channels equally, whereas time decay gives the most credit to the most recent channel and the least credit to the oldest channel for that customer or lead. To track each lead’s or customer’s fractional attribution, however, you will likely need a new field created in marketing automation and/or CRM. I’ve often created what I call a “running lead source” field, which appends the last lead source to the end of the field every time a new channel is encountered by this lead: I can then download my leads into an Excel spreadsheet and break apart and examine the array of data in this field. I also find this approach useful for reviewing which content pieces had an impact on the buying cycle for leads. Set up Google Search Console Ideally, your website(s) already have Google Search Console (GSC) set up. And I expect that for many, it goes without saying that GSC is an essential SEO tool, helping you to understand measurements that you can’t typically ascertain on your own. For instance, when we advertise using Google AdWords or other paid search platforms, the platforms provide us with impression data and click through rate (CTR). This helps us to understand how many people, when presented with our message, seemed interested enough to click through. With organic search, however, it’s a bit more difficult. You don’t know how many people searched for your keywords and the CTR — unless you use GSC. However, there are a few pitfalls to avoid with GSC: GSC only keeps the last 90 days of search history. Be sure to download CSVs of data from GSC before that data is erased. HTTP and HTTPS must be tracked under separate GSC website properties. Ideally, you should move to HTTPS for SEO reasons too, but if you still use both HTTP and HTTPS, you’ll need to have a GSC website property for each and then combine impressions and clicks data from each. However, do not combine or average percentage data, like click-through rate. You’d basically be taking an average of an average, which is inaccurate. You’ll need to calculate this on your own after combining the raw impressions and clicks first. Mobile sites and desktop sites may be tracked separately. If you have a separate mobile website (not necessarily a responsive site) such as m.domain.com, then you’ll need a separate website property in GSC to track it. Subdomains must be tracked on their own GSC website property. I know, not ideal. But Google clarifies how GSC sees domains in this highlight: If you have to create multiple website properties in GSC, you can now at least tie them together using Property Sets, which allow you to see the data in a combined report. Optimize website analytics Whether you use Google Analytics (GA) or another website analytics package, website analytics data is incredibly helpful for understanding ROI. With GA, there are several steps I recommend to help track ROI: Add your site’s domain to the referral exclusion list. Recently, I shared how a tracking change in Universal GA causes many sites to incorrectly attribute some traffic to the site’s own domain as a referral. Fixing this problem for one of my clients caused them to see an uptick of 16 percent week over week in organic search traffic that had been previously attributed as self-referral. Set up goals. Goals can be any call to action on your website, but for ROI, you’ll likely want to track goals that are directly attributable to lead generation or purchase, such as a request for a quote or even a newsletter signup. Remember to be judicious in how you use your goals, because each reporting view is limited to 20 goals. Set up e-commerce tracking. I expect most e-commerce companies already do this, but if not, be sure to set up e-commerce tracking in GA. It can give you an immediate view into actual sales from various channels. Use the Attribution Modeling tool. Setting up goals and e-commerce tracking also helps provide more information in the GA Attribution Modeling tool. This tool allows you to compare various attribution models and determine which channels are performing best. Connect GSC to GA. It’s helpful to have much of GSC’s data directly in GA. If you want to get really sophisticated, you can try to upload your offline sales data into GA as well, using Data Import. Data can be uploaded manually or via the API; so if you don’t have a developer who can help you, it can be a highly manual process. Data Import will then reveal much of what you need to know about sales data directly in GA, including lifetime value. However, it still does not allow you to personally identify specific customers or prospects — just overall trends. Integrate marketing automation and CRM While website analytics are helpful, they cannot identify individual buyers and how those individual buyers found your site. Also, it’s difficult to ascertain lifetime value of a marketing channel when you can’t ascertain the lifetime value of an individual customer through a given marketing platform. That’s where your marketing automation and CRM tools come in. Unlike Google Analytics, which dictates in its terms of use that you cannot have personally identifiable information, marketing automation and CRM are all about personally identifiable information. Earlier I mentioned the running lead source field I created in my Marketo and Salesforce.com platforms. This allows me to pull data from Salesforce, along with lead status and opportunity and value information to determine which lead sources contributed to actual qualified leads, opportunities and total sales. Begin to measure and report In every case I’ve seen, organic search plays a significant role, if not the most important role, in conversion. Here’s the model I like to use to demonstrate the value of SEO in an ROI report, showing all of the stages that an organic search visitor likely came through. I use this particular table in Excel to calculate B2B ROI from a first- or last-touch attribution model: Another good report to run to determine the value of each channel is separate from ROI — Average Order Value (AOV) and Average Lifetime Value. If you are an e-commerce company, then you can likely track this by customer in your e-commerce platform. But when you’re tracking offline sales, you may need to calculate this yourself. If you use Data Import for GA, you can track AOV in GA. Average lifetime value may be more difficult to track directly in GA, so you can use this table to help you calculate that: Once you have a list of all of your customers from the organic channel, you can determine what the average lifetime value is across the organic search channel by dividing the total lifetime value of all customers in this channel combined by total customers in this channel. These tables are important because, when run against other channels, you’ll often find that organic search has high values. This can certainly help justify your value and the value of your service to the company. If you use a fractional attribution model, however, you can’t really use the table above, as you might double-count conversions and sales against multiple channels. That’s where things get a bit more complicated. You’ll likely need to assign a percentage value to each channel that touched the customer, then only attribute a percentage of that sale’s value to each channel. Use conversion rate optimization to improve organic conversion Once you finally know these numbers from organic search, begin focusing on how to improve them. If you’re driving lots of organic traffic to your site, but that traffic isn’t meeting your site goals (lead generation or purchase), then consider how you can test improvements to your site through conversion rate optimization techniques. Since our ultimate measurement is ROI, it’s not enough for marketers to consider SEO successful just because organic site traffic is high. ROI isn’t about traffic — it’s about revenue. Do everything you can to improve that progression from organic search visit to conversion so that those visitors have a greater opportunity to influence your ROI.

SUBSCRIBE Google Maps app adds “Ok Google” voice command activation for hands free directions Google improves voice search while using the Google Maps app. Barry Schwartz on September 29, 2016 at 9:42 am More Google announced they have updated the Google Maps app so you can just say, “Ok Google,” to activate voice search within the app. You no longer need to tap the microphone icon or type in your destination search — just say, “Ok Google.” Google said on the latest version of the Google Maps app you can “enter navigation mode or driving mode, you can simply say ,’Ok Google,’ followed by a voice command, without needing to tap or even look at the screen.” Here is a screen shot: Google has a whole slew of voice commands within the Google Maps app. They release a cheat sheet of these commands, including: Directions and travel: “Mute” or “Mute voice guidance” “Unmute” or “Unmute voice guidance” “Show traffic” or “Hide traffic” “Show satellite” or “Hide satellite” “Navigate home” or “Navigate to Starbucks” “Show route overview” or “Show alternate routes” “What road is this?” “What’s my next turn?” “What’s my ETA?” “How’s traffic ahead?” or “How’s traffic to home?” “What’s the weather like?” “Avoid tolls” or “Enable tolls” “Avoid highways” or “Enable highways” “Avoid ferries” or “Enable ferries” “Exit navigation” More commands you can say: “Call Mom” “Find gas stations” or “Find restaurants” “Send a text to Larry” or “Send a SMS to Sergey, I’m feeling lucky” “What’s the weather like?” or “How’s the weather in Seattle?” “Play some jazz” or “Play happy birthday on Google Play Music” “What’s the closest hotel?” “When’s my next meeting?” To make sure this feature is on, be sure you have the latest version of the app, tap the overflow menu (the button with three dots), then tap “Settings,” and finally, tap ‘“Ok Google” detection.”’ The “While driving” setting allows you to say, “Ok Google,” during navigation in Google Maps. If you’d like to do this anywhere on your device, you’ll need to enable the “Always on” setting (On some devices, the setting is called “From any screen”).

Babak Pahlavan, senior director of measurement & analytics at Google, unveiled a variety of new features and beta tests for the search giant's measurement platform at SMX East in New York City. “The objective is to enable measurement for every business, regardless of size,” said Pahlavan on Sept. 28. In keeping with that philosophy, Google released a free version of a new tool called “Optimize,” which helps communicators run tests and experiments on landing pages and create unique experiences for users. For now, Optimize is in beta, but you can sign up to get access here. In an effort to make measurement reporting more collaborative, Google Data Studio became fully available in 21 countries after being released in the U.S. in March. The feature pulls data from Google Analytics and other sources to create simple and visually appealing dashboards. Google will add pre-made templates to the Data Studio in the coming weeks. To hear more about Google Analytics' latest developments from Jocelyn Whittenburg, product marketing manager at Google, join PR News at the Google for Communicators Boot Camp on Nov. 17 in NYC. Pahlavan also talked about a new metric available in Google Analytics and the addition of 20 tags to Google Tag Manager (here’s a full list of the supported tags). The addition of “session quality score” as a metric in Google Analytics comes as an expansion of the platforms machine-learning capabilities. Session quality score uses machine learning to predict the likelihood that someone will make a transaction—essentially highlighting high-value visits for future outreach.

Now an update to the Google app and Maps for Android adds navigation specific commands that aim to make the voice assistant more useful when driving. Using voice search and navigation commands requires the latest version of the Google app and Maps. Under “Ok Google” detection in Google app settings, there is a new “While driving” toggle that enables the specific voice commands while in Maps. When activated, users will be able to say “Ok Google” followed by a command when in navigation or driving mode. A white microphone icon in the top right corner reminds users that hotword detection is live. Alternatively, that button can be tapped to start a command. Voice search allows users to get directions or bring up a map of a location. Navigation commands include showing traffic, switching between map layers, and navigating to preset home and work locations. Questions like “What’s my next turn?” and “What’s my ETA?” can also be asked and will be answered verbally. System-wide functions like texting a person, finding out the weather, and showing the nearest hotel can also be accessed in this mode. The full list of commands are below: Directions and travel “Mute.” or “Mute voice guidance.” “Unmute.” or “Unmute voice guidance.” “Show traffic.” or “Hide traffic.” “Show satellite.” or “Hide satellite.” “Navigate home.” or “Navigate to Starbucks.” “Show route overview.” or “Show alternate routes.” “What road is this?” “What’s my next turn?” “What’s my ETA?” “How’s traffic ahead?” or “How’s traffic to home?” “What’s the weather like?” “Avoid tolls.” or “Enable tolls.” “Avoid highways.” or “Enable highways.” “Avoid ferries.” or “Enable ferries.” “Exit navigation.” More commands you can say “Call Mom.” “Find gas stations.” or “Find restaurants.” “Send a text to Larry.” or “Send a SMS to Sergey, I’m feeling lucky.” “What’s the weather like?” or “How’s the weather in Seattle?” “Play some jazz.” or “Play happy birthday on Google Play Music.” “What’s the closest hotel?” “When’s my next meeting?” Guides Google Maps View THe Guide blog comments powered by Disqus Submit a Tip cancel Submitting a tip constitutes permission to publish and syndicate.

Probably VR ADVERTISE SUBSCRIBE CONTACT ABOUT MACHINES Is the goal of democratising AI just a pipe dream? by John Kennedy 29 Sep 20167 Shares If the social media revolution has taught us anything, it is that tech giants will need real humans to give machines their vaunted artificial intelligence. Image: Michal Bednarek/Shutterstock Microsoft, Google, Facebook, Amazon, IBM and other tech companies have joined forces to democratise artificial intelligence (AI) and make it available for everyone. But what are their real motives? The AI world is exploding. 10 of the biggest power brokers have joined forces to bring some clarity to a world still fumbling with smartphones, and one that hasn’t quite gotten its head around what AI really means for it. It’s called the Partnership on AI to benefit People and Society. Sounds lofty and earnest, but these are businesses after all. Could this be more of the passive-aggressive PR shtick from a bunch of tech giants who talk about being open and transparent, but really prefer to keep you at arm’s length behind security desks and email addresses that no one replies to? It’s like talking up social media when your approach can at best be described as sociopathic. What snake oil is this? Do they want to improve AI as a team when they compete ruthlessly against each other? What are they really selling here? Remember dear human, you will always be the product The tech giants pushing AI are already driving significant advances; one might say that we are in the age of machine intelligence. For example, Intel recently bought Irish tech company Movidius, whose machine learning chip can help devices like DRI drones to see and understand. It’s like we are at the gates of Florence and the Renaissance is about to unfold. And it already looks magnificent. Microsoft is building what it claims to be the world’s most powerful AI supercomputer, which it plans to make available to everyone to harness the full power of AI. IBM’s Watson has been beating humans at chess for some time now. Facebook has already installed AI agents inside Messenger to converse with humans on behalf of businesses. Google’s latest neural machine technology can translate entire sentences from English to Chinese and vice versa. As for Amazon, God only knows what Jeff Bezos has up his sleeve, but it probably involves swarms of delivery drones or entire AI servers on demand (think Amazon Supercomputer Services) that will unleash another wave of entrepreneurship. But when big businesses talk about sharing the spoils of their advances in AI do they really want to share? What’s their real game here? In the dawn of social media, it was information. What you do with that information, that is called intelligence. It therefore makes sense to the masters of AI to invite society to their party good and early. Think about it. Humans are already product, when you consider the 1.5bn people who use Facebook every month. Humans are advertising fodder. It makes sense for Google to create free services like Translate or Gmail because it’s a captive audience for advertising. It’s not personal – well, it is – but it’s just business. Microsoft seems to be really taking this benefiting humanity stuff seriously. Not only did it promise free supercomputing resources, but it made a bold statement this week that it intends to infuse every application and device with cognitive capabilities. It has already done so in Windows 10 with Cortana, which it says has achieved 12bn queries from over 133m active users. Other examples include the photo editing tool Pix, which has apparent powers of perception and a location-aware app called MileIQ that helps you calculate expenses without doing much. Another thing worth considering is how AI could be used to replace humans in jobs. Who needs call centre agents when Facebook Messenger has bots that can carry a good conversation? Will AI reduce the number of people in the working world? Will robots take our jobs? What is the point in talking about democratisation when people won’t be able to put food on their plates? Or will AI go the other way? Will it augment our lives, make us more productive and lead to more opportunities for gainful employment and fulfilling healthy, happy lives? Let’s hope so. “AI technologies hold tremendous potential to improve many aspects of life; ranging from healthcare, education, and manufacturing, to home automation and transportation,” the Partnership on AI said in its mission statement. “Through rigorous research, the development of best practices, and an open and transparent dialogue, the founding members of the Partnership on AI hope to maximise this potential and ensure it benefits as many people as possible.” That’s fair enough. But you can’t help but wonder how AI is going to benefit these behemoths first before the rest of us figure it out.

(Google) CTVNews.ca Staff Published Thursday, September 29, 2016 11:48AM EDT A 16-year-old South African student has won the grand prize at Google’s Science Fair for her simple orange peel mixture that could help farmers across her drought-stricken country. Kiara Nirghin of Johannesburg won Google Science Fair’s US$50,000 grand prize Tuesday for her submission “Fighting Drought with Fruit.” She was one of 16 finalists who were invited to the ceremony at Google Headquarters in Mountain View, Calif. Nirghin’s innovation combines sundried orange and avocado peels to create a biodegradable mixture that can retain more than 75 per cent of rainwater. “I believe that food and chemistry are undoubtedly linked in the intertwined science web. I love molecular gastronomy and the application of scientific principles in food creation,” Nirghin wrote in her submission. The innovation came in response to one of South Africa’s most devastating droughts in 45 years. In all of 2015, regions across the country received only 403 mm of rain on average, 34 per cent below the annual average, according to the South African Weather Service. As farmers’ crops withered and died, many turned to superabsorbent polymers (SAPs) to retain water in soil. The powders hold large amounts of water relative to their mass and create a hydrogel “reservoir.” However, SAPS are also very expensive and not biodegradable. Nirghin wanted to find a natural solution that farmers could afford. She discovered orange peels could work as a biodegradable polymer but would still need to be chemically processed. Instead, she boiled the orange peels with oil from avocado peels then used the photo polymerization of sunlight to connect the polymers. Over the course of 45 days, Nirghin watched as pots containing her mixture retained more water, kept soil moist and produced more flowers than those with commercial SAPs. Products on the market can cost up to $3,000 per metric ton, while she said her version would cost $30-60 per metric ton. Nirghin said the Google Science Fair prize would help bring her idea to life. “With the prize I will hope to continue my studies in science, but also further the scientific development and application of my idea, and in addition extend scientific progress in elevating the problems that South Africa faces in food security and sustainable agricultural development,” she wrote in her submission.

Home Entertainment BellaNaija Ladun Liadi Linda Ikeji Nigerian Newspapers Daily Times Guardian Newspaper National Mirror Punch Newspaper The Nation Newspaper Nigerian Pilot Newspaper Vanguard Newspaper Nigeria News PM News Premium Times TV Stations Channels TV Lagos Television TVC News TV Continental Videos Music Videos Notjustok Tooxclusive News Videos YOHAIG Think YOruba HAusa IGbo BlackBerry lesson: adapt or die in the internet Age Posted September 29, 2016 3:26 pm by admin Comments BlackBerry has joined Yahoo, Nokia and other technology industry stars felled by an internet age in which companies are forced to evolve quickly or perish. Canadian-based BlackBerry announced Wednesday it would halt in-house production of smartphones, marking the end of an era for the once-dominant handset producer. Originally known as Research in Motion, the company earned a dedicated following of “CrackBerry” addicts and introduced millions to the smartphone. But, its luster faded with the introduction of the iPhone in 2007 and the large number of low-costs Android handsets that followed. BlackBerry travelled a road well-worn. Finland’s Nokia, once the world’s largest mobile phone maker, has seen its smartphone business go up in smoke as well. Internet pioneer Yahoo recently inked a deal to sell its core business to US telecommunications firm Verizon after years of struggling in vain to revive growth in an online search market usurped by Google. “What they have in common is that they haven’t reacted well to rapid change from their original positions,” said Endpoint Technologies Associates analyst Roger Kay. “Tech has high velocity.” The tech sector is young and fast-moving in an internet culture that praises “disruption” and “revolution” of industries and lifestyles. Among mottos found on the walls of leading social network Facebook is “Move fast and break things.” Smartphones themselves have become seemingly indispensible, with people typically replacing handsets every year or two in order to have the newest features or capabilities. – Resting on laurels – Changing to capitalize on a new trend can be daunting for companies comfortable with products that keep revenue flowing for the moment. “It reminds me of all those old singers going to Las Vegas to do whatever it is they do when they should really have just stopped,” Kay said of tech companies sticking with what early hits. “Everybody wants to do an encore and get paid again.” When Apple launched the iPhone in 2007, some critiques questioned why the California company was “cannibalizing” its successful line of iPods. The iPhone became a global sensation, and a main driver of stellar profit for Apple. Kay noted that when Yahoo ruled internet search it became clear their model was under attack by a newcomer called Google. Yahoo may not have seen the threat, or may have blinded itself to the need for change because its old business model continued to pump revenue, according to Kay. And while there are individual specifics underlying the downfall of incumbent mobile phone titans, they all faced the sudden and simultaneous rise of two powerhouses Apple disrupted smartphones and lifestyles with its iPhone, and Google fired back with an Android mobile operating system that any consumer electronics maker was free to use. The Google and Apple one-two punch was enough to essentially “pivot” a smartphone market that incumbents thought was too stable to rattle, according to independent Silicon Valley analyst Rob Enderle. “None of the big firms were prepared to deal with it,” Enderle said of two companies new to the smartphone scene fueling a revolution. Unlike the birth of search engine Google on a young and growing internet, mobile phones were an existing market that incumbents felt they knew well and were “completely taken aback b the combination of Apple and Google,” according to Enderle. – Reinvention – Veteran technology firms being overtaken by newcomers is not necessarily inevitable, if established companies have the wit and courage to re-invent themselves, adapting to survive. Analyst Kay noted IBM, a century-old technology company that has embraced transformation time and again, even shedding products along the way. Computer chip giant Intel shifted its focus to microprocessors for mobile devices to adapt to how internet-connected devices were evolving. Apple itself was a computer company on the brink of bankruptcy when it staked its future on iPods and iPhones in a winning move that made it one of the most profitable companies on the planet. The future is a question mark for Microsoft, once the world’s largest company, which has fallen behind Apple and Google as the PC industry declines and which is refocusing on enterprise services. But reinvention isn’t a cure-all, and needs ongoing commitment to change along with vision of where markets are heading. IBM now seems tangled in endless restructuring, with revenue declining for more than four years; Intel continues to struggle to find the kind of success it had with big computer chips. Analysts have taken to wondering whether Apple itself has become too dependent on the iPhone, and is taking too long to come up with “the next big thing.” AFP The post BlackBerry lesson: adapt or die in the internet Age appeared first on Punch Newspapers.

(Of course you do!) Then you probably know Phil Nickinson. (Don't you?!) Phil's the guy who's spent the last six years leading one of the internet's most recognized and respected Android sites -- the one and only Android Central. He is apparently not, however, a professional golfer. (Or so I'm told.) Wondering why Phil has that fancy new "e"-word at the end of his title? It's because after attending approximately 7,427 press events and reviewing 19.4 gazillion phones, he recently hung up his Sparkly Sequined Editor Hat (standard-issue) in order to focus on a mysterious new project at Mobile Nations (the publisher behind Android Central and a bunch of other websites). The specifics on Phil's new project are slim -- and no matter how much I threatened to tickle him, he wouldn't spill the beans -- but if all goes according to plan, we'll find out what's cookin' within the next few months. (My current working theory involves a hammock, a hamster, and that one guy from Bell Biv Devoe, but don't hold me to that.) In the meantime, I was able to convince Phil to step out of his metaphorical kitchen for a few minutes to chat about how he uses Android in his day-to-day life. This is a man who has seen and used practically every Android device over the past several years, after all -- and a fair number of apps and customization tools, to boot. So what devices does someone with so much knowledge carry around in his own trousers, and how does he make the most of what they have to offer? Enough with the suspense already. In his own words, this is how Phil Nickinson uses Android. The basics Your current primary phone: When I wasn’t reviewing phones, most of the past year has been spent on a Nexus 6P on Project Fi or a Samsung Galaxy S7 on Verizon. The 6P was always bigger than I liked -- as I quickly learned with the thing in my pocket on the 20-hour return trip from a Huawei junket in China, actually. But I love having actual speakers. (It’s a shame the HTC 10 was unusable for me because of the screen polarization. We need sunglasses in Florida.) I’ve never been a fan of Samsung’s software -- or the physical home button, or the layout of the capacitive buttons -- but you can’t beat the camera, and the size of the GS7 was perfect for me. But I keep coming back to the Nexus because it’s also the only one that’s worked flawlessly with Android Auto, and that’s been a big deal for me. I’ll definitely be getting the next Google phone in October. And I picked up an iPhone 7 because I need to be familiar with iOS for the new gig. But you can be damned sure it’s loaded up with proper Google apps. What case is on your phone (if any): I’ve never been a case guy, mostly because I was always having to take pictures of my phone. Maybe that’ll change now that I’m not going through a half-dozen devices a month. Your current tablet (if any): I spent much of the past year with a Pixel C in my bag. But I recently swapped it out for an iPad Pro. (The 9.7-inch one, not the monster.) A few reasons for that: One is that the Pixel C was sort of an abomination that probably never should have been released. It was designed for something that it never actually was going to do. It was a fine enough tablet, I guess, but not one that was ever meant to be held. It just wasn’t comfortable like the Nexus 9. And the keyboard scratched the hell out of it. (How did they never release a basic cover?) I also decided I wanted something with cellular connectivity, and that’s harder to do in the U.S. than it should be. So, it’s an iPad loaded up with Google apps, which remain excellent. But a fun fact: Other apps on the iPad often are as poorly done as apps on an Android tablet. Your current smartwatch (if any): I’m not wearing it as much as I used to, but the Huawei Watch is still, IMHO, the best all-around Android Wear watch. Yeah, having to charge every day is a pain. And it still doesn’t really have any one feature that I just have to have. But it’s been great for quickly getting rid of email on the go, and this is one of the affordable ones that looks like a watch first. What face you're using on your watch right now: I’ve been using Mirage by Monostone. I don’t change watch faces all that often -- usually I just pick the best of what’s built in and go with that. But this one really stood out for me when I saw Google highlight it on Twitter. The home screen A quick walk-through of your phone's home screen setup: My home screen largely hasn’t changed over the past few years. I’ve got the docked apps and occasionally a folder at the bottom, with a row of folders above that. The rest of the space is dedicated to a calendar agenda widget. I don’t use second or third screens, and I never really got into Google Now. Just a home screen and an app drawer, thanks. I’ve got a folder for social stuff and a folder for messaging, and another for apps I tend to use more often. Plus a dedicated folder for travel apps, since I was on the road so much. New is a folder full of smart home-type apps -- Nest, Ring, Philips Hue, Alexa, Sonos and the like. (I wonder if that’ll change if and when Google Home comes to fruition?) What launcher you're using: I’ve been a longtime fan of Action Launcher, and so I’ve been using AL3 since it was released. (And I’m a huge supporter of developers, so I’m more than happy with Action Launcher’s move to a freemium model.) The big reason I’ve stuck with Action Launcher, though, is the side drawer. It’s a little bit of a throwback to Windows Phone, actually, which is kind of fun. But mostly it’s because grids of app icons bore me to death, and I have small hands. So that side drawer works perfect. And it’s ridiculously fast. I really got into a couple of its biggest features -- Covers and Shutters. What wallpaper you're using: Most of the time I end up using whatever wallpaper comes stock on a review phone. Maybe I’d change it up just so things look a little different than every other review out there. On my long-term phones I load up Muzei and one of the NASA APOD extensions, then let that rotate through. Anything else of note (interesting customizations, special icons, etc): I don’t generally bother with icon packs (unless I’m using a Huawei phone with EMUI), but folks have always asked about the calendar agenda widget. For years I used Pure Calendar Agenda, but it’s all but abandoned. I recently switched to aCalendar+ and couldn’t be happier. The experience and the apps What's one of your favorite Android-related tips or tricks? Customize your home screen! It’s depressing to see how many people on the street use their phone as the manufacturer (or, worse, carrier) sent it. Don’t be afraid to try new things. Someone at AT&T or Samsung -- even Google -- has no idea how you use your phone. Which apps you want, and when you use them the most. Take a few minutes and figure out what works best. And then keep adjusting over time until you hit that sweet spot. And there’s exactly zero reason to ever lose things. Contacts, email and especially pictures -- they can all live in the cloud for pennies. Google Photos is excellent. Or Dropbox or OneDrive or some other file backup service. Beyond the obvious stock Google programs, a few apps you can't live without right now (and a quick word about why): A password manager (I happen to use 1Password) probably is the most important app I have, followed closely by a two-factor authentication app. (For that I use Authy.) There’s simply no excuse for using weak (or repeated) passwords, and 2FA is a must. That’s not sexy, but it’s damned important. Beyond that, I don’t think I use anything too exotic. (The new Google Trips looks pretty exciting.) Check out more Android expert profiles below or in the official Google+ collection -- and stay tuned for even more entries in the weeks to come!

Now a satellite imaging firm called Orbital Insight claims to have an answer. It says that in May, Chinese inventories stood at 600 million barrels, substantially larger than commonly thought and nearly as big as the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Chinese storage capacity, which includes working inventory, is four times greater than widely used estimates, the firm says, adding that it has not only been able to count storage tanks, but it has also used imaging techniques to figure out how much oil is in the tanks. The issue could influence expectations in oil markets. If China has built larger reserves than previously estimated, that means much of what looked like oil demand over the past couple of years was not a result of higher consumption but of strategic planning. It would make OPEC’s task of cutting output to drive up prices more difficult. And it could provide a buffer for China in the event of a sudden disruption in imported supplies. The new estimate comes from a firm founded by James Crawford, who formerly worked on Google’s book-scanning project. Crawford said he left Google because the price of Earth-orbiting hardware was falling and the amount of satellite images was booming, so he recruited some NASA scientists and started a new business. He has received backing from the investment firms Sequoia and Google Ventures. The firm pays a percentage of its revenues to satellite image providers.

For its Chinese analysis, Crawford said the firm went back to images taken from 2010 to 2014 and counted the number of oil storage tanks built and destroyed and came up with a figure of 2,100 storage tanks, far higher than the 500 tanks in the industry standard database in TankTerminals.com. Orbital also used its own algorithms to calculate how much was in the tanks. “Floating roofs sit on top of crude oil tanks for a variety of reasons, for example, to minimize breathing and evaporative losses,” the company said in a release. “As the reservoirs are filled and emptied, the roofs rise and fall, reflected in the crescent moon-like shadows from the walls of the reservoir. The size and shape of the shadow is a sensitive metric of the volume of oil held in the tank.” The firm cannot, however, discern whether there are underground storage facilities. The dispute over Chinese inventories will likely continue. Orbital Insight’s estimate far exceeds the figure given in a rare glimpse of China’s oil supplies by its government. On Sept. 2, the Chinese state-owned news agency said that China had 287 million barrels of oil in strategic storage sites in eight cities as well as in commercial facilities at the beginning of the year. Started in 2004, the Chinese strategic stockpile would only be enough to cover 36 days of oil imports, said the Xinhua news agency quoting CNPC Economics & Technology Research Institute. The country’s goal is to have large enough strategic stockpiles to cover 100 days of imports, a target the government’s five-year plan said might not be complete by the 2020 goal. The U.S. reserve is big enough to cover about 150 days of imports. However, with low prices, China has been on a buying spree, many analysts believe. The nation has been importing a record 7.5 million barrels a day. china-oil Share Tweet LinkedIn Print Subscribe More News Suggested Stories: Ask AP: Commercial Biodiesel, the Nation's Cash – Aug 30, 2008 US companies falling behind as Africa surges – Aug 6, 2014 A commodity boom blasts through Amazon forests, taking a heavy toll – Jan 11, 2015 Money laundering investigation stymied by China, Italy says – Jun 5, 2015 Advertisement Comments Subscribe to the Journal for only $12.

Being something of a search weenie, as my eyelids were feeling heavy today I found myself mulling over the problem, “How would one detect Google spamming?” The answer turns out to be surprisingly easy. Who has an incentive to spam Google? People living from advertising. Who owns the largest online display ad network? Google. Unlike with email, where there are heuristics at work to guess the intentions of the sender based on the content, Google has that data right in front of them. So, here’s the heresy: the spamminess of a web site is inversely proportional to its ad click-through. Think about it — in a typical internet search, a navigation path terminating at that page is the best result. If they click on an ad, it probably means you missed serving up the right page in the first place. As a corollary, the pages best optimized to pull you in via a search term and send you back out via a related ad are among the worst results. So if you’re Google which value do you optimize for? More ad clicks or better search results? I’m a big enough Google fan that I believe that they’d mostly want to optimize for good search results since that’s what made them the company that they are. But what do you do if there’s an inverse correlation between the two? Bite the hand that feeds you? Thinking about things this way in my opinion makes the issue even more interesting, because it seems to hint at something systemic — i.e. that there there might be something deeper problematic in financing search through display advertising. Obviously this is a massive oversimplification of the problem of spam, but the paradox intrigued me. Tweet Follow us on Twitter • Fan us on Facebook 6 Comments Brian Shaffer: I predict that we’re going to see a rise of niche search engines – search engines that only go for one industry and are human reviewed by experts in that industry. There’s already mahalo.com for human reviewed results, and there’s plenty of high quality news aggregators for certain industries like Hacker News. Google did acquire boat loads of startups that go after a specific niche in 2010. I’m always up for a good conspiracy theory of Google stretching it’s net over more of the web, but I don’t think the foresight stretches this far. Google is becoming more and more like a traditional business and the finances often push heavily towards short term and quarterly profits. AdSense performance to them is becoming more important than quality of organic results. January 6, 2011, 6:07 am Paul Houle: Myself, I’d turn it around. People make pages junky because they want to increase the clickthrough rate. For instance, take domain parking pages. Most people look at these and think they’re looking at a piece of junk made by an amateur. Nothing could be further from the truth. Domain parking pages are scientifically designed to confuse and dazzle viewers. If you look for the content, it gradually dawns on you that there’s nothing there… The ads look more relevant than the content, so you click and the owners of the page hear ca-ching. Major domainers continuously tweak their pages to improve their advertising rates, so you’d better believe that this works. One of my pet peeves are pages that have no content above the fold… Just some big ads, and if you’re lucky, a promise that you’ll find some content if you scroll down. I’d really like to see ~those~ go away. Now, as someone who develops legitimate web sites, I want to get real organic links and not damage my brand with offensive advertising. That said, I still find it’s profitable to place ads in such a way that users sometimes experience a moment of confusion that breaks through banner blindness. In my case, however, there’s more like 80% content and 20% ads on the page and I think that’s fair. January 6, 2011, 6:26 am Ben Atlas: Scott, you are on the right, in addition Google, by the virtue of their ad supported business model, encourages quantity over quality. They are more interested in the pennies per clicks pages inventory, it adds up. The spam is the extension of this philosophy, not necessarily as stated goal. Also the internet evolved as a giant aggregation machine. Ads seek display opportunities, content seeks direct monetization. Now you cans see how this core game is rigged and what incredible damage it does to our culture. January 6, 2011, 7:25 am David: I’ve often imagined that a company as large as Google would eventually reach a point where it might have a few “financial tuneables” it could apply in times of deflated growth, as a result of failed products or revenues from existing products failing to materialize. In a machine as complex and driven by algorithmic automation as Google, its ad networks, and its anti-spam systems, it’s not hard to imagine there are some constants (in the programming sense) that can be tuned up to affect a greater quality in search results (but with less Adsense units being shown), or down to affect a greater increase in “spam” (but with more Adsense units being shown, and thus improved revenue). Of course such tuneables could not be used lightly, as they’d negatively effect the quality of clicks advertisers were receiving from Adsense, but as a short term fix to a revenue loss, or simply for “financial padding”, it seems obvious to me that such a mechanism could exist. This comes to my mind every time I see a deluge of Adsense spam sites in the search results for content that originated on Stack Overflow, etc. January 7, 2011, 12:02 am Nomnom: So the fact that google powers both adsense and adwords in of it self in any other time period would lead to googles painful decline into regulatory purgatory. I think you’re pointing the conundrum that google is in but why are they the only ones who know it? In this case, where’s the Feds? January 7, 2011, 8:18 pm Luke: Everyone is asking why Google are allowing the quality of their search results to get worse, whilst their competitors are making improvements? Should we expect a big update soon at Google, is this the reason? Or do they have such a market share and greed that they just want to earn more from adsense spam at the expense of providing quality search results? Many techies are switching to Bing already, Google’s increasingly spammy serps and Instant are just too frustrating!

Canadian-based BlackBerry announced Wednesday it would halt in-house production of smartphones, marking the end of an era for the once-dominant handset producer. Originally known as Research in Motion, the company earned a dedicated following of "CrackBerry" addicts and introduced millions to the smartphone. But, its luster faded with the introduction of the iPhone in 2007 and the large number of low-costs Android handsets that followed. BlackBerry travelled a road well-worn. Finland's Nokia, once the world's largest mobile phone maker, has seen its smartphone business go up in smoke as well. Internet pioneer Yahoo recently inked a deal to sell its core business to US telecommunications firm Verizon after years of struggling in vain to revive growth in an online search market usurped by Google. "What they have in common is that they haven't reacted well to rapid change from their original positions," said Endpoint Technologies Associates analyst Roger Kay. "Tech has high velocity." The tech sector is young and fast-moving in an internet culture that praises "disruption" and "revolution" of industries and lifestyles. Among mottos found on the walls of leading social network Facebook is "Move fast and break things." Smartphones themselves have become seemingly indispensible, with people typically replacing handsets every year or two in order to have the newest features or capabilities. - Resting on laurels - Changing to capitalize on a new trend can be daunting for companies comfortable with products that keep revenue flowing for the moment. "It reminds me of all those old singers going to Las Vegas to do whatever it is they do when they should really have just stopped," Kay said of tech companies sticking with what early hits. "Everybody wants to do an encore and get paid again." When Apple launched the iPhone in 2007, some critiques questioned why the California company was "cannibalizing" its successful line of iPods. The iPhone became a global sensation, and a main driver of stellar profit for Apple. Kay noted that when Yahoo ruled internet search it became clear their model was under attack by a newcomer called Google. Yahoo may not have seen the threat, or may have blinded itself to the need for change because its old business model continued to pump revenue, according to Kay. And while there are individual specifics underlying the downfall of incumbent mobile phone titans, they all faced the sudden and simultaneous rise of two powerhouses Apple disrupted smartphones and lifestyles with its iPhone, and Google fired back with an Android mobile operating system that any consumer electronics maker was free to use. The Google and Apple one-two punch was enough to essentially "pivot" a smartphone market that incumbents thought was too stable to rattle, according to independent Silicon Valley analyst Rob Enderle. "None of the big firms were prepared to deal with it," Enderle said of two companies new to the smartphone scene fueling a revolution. Unlike the birth of search engine Google on a young and growing internet, mobile phones were an existing market that incumbents felt they knew well and were "completely taken aback by the combination of Apple and Google," according to Enderle. - Reinvention - Veteran technology firms being overtaken by newcomers is not necessarily inevitable, if established companies have the wit and courage to re-invent themselves, adapting to survive. Analyst Kay noted IBM, a century-old technology company that has embraced transformation time and again, even shedding products along the way. Computer chip giant Intel shifted its focus to microprocessors for mobile devices to adapt to how internet-connected devices were evolving. Apple itself was a computer company on the brink of bankruptcy when it staked its future on iPods and iPhones in a winning move that made it one of the most profitable companies on the planet. The future is a question mark for Microsoft, once the world's largest company, which has fallen behind Apple and Google as the PC industry declines and which is refocusing on enterprise services. But reinvention isn't a cure-all, and needs ongoing commitment to change along with vision of where markets are heading. IBM now seems tangled in endless restructuring, with revenue declining for more than four years; Intel continues to struggle to find the kind of success it had with big computer chips. Analysts have taken to wondering whether Apple itself has become too dependent on the iPhone, and is taking too long to come up with "the next big thing."

The tech sector is young and fast-moving in an internet culture that praises "disruption" and "revolution" of industries and lifestyles. Among mottos found on the walls of leading social network Facebook is "Move fast and break things." Smartphones themselves have become seemingly indispensible, with people typically replacing handsets every year or two in order to have the newest features or capabilities. - Resting on laurels - Changing to capitalize on a new trend can be daunting for companies comfortable with products that keep revenue flowing for the moment. "It reminds me of all those old singers going to Las Vegas to do whatever it is they do when they should really have just stopped," Kay said of tech companies sticking with what early hits. "Everybody wants to do an encore and get paid again." When Apple launched the iPhone in 2007, some critiques questioned why the California company was "cannibalizing" its successful line of iPods. The iPhone became a global sensation, and a main driver of stellar profit for Apple. Kay noted that when Yahoo ruled internet search it became clear their model was under attack by a newcomer called Google. Yahoo may not have seen the threat, or may have blinded itself to the need for change because its old business model continued to pump revenue, according to Kay. And while there are individual specifics underlying the downfall of incumbent mobile phone titans, they all faced the sudden and simultaneous rise of two powerhouses Apple disrupted smartphones and lifestyles with its iPhone, and Google fired back with an Android mobile operating system that any consumer electronics maker was free to use. The Google and Apple one-two punch was enough to essentially "pivot" a smartphone market that incumbents thought was too stable to rattle, according to independent Silicon Valley analyst Rob Enderle. "None of the big firms were prepared to deal with it," Enderle said of two companies new to the smartphone scene fueling a revolution. Unlike the birth of search engine Google on a young and growing internet, mobile phones were an existing market that incumbents felt they knew well and were "completely taken aback by the combination of Apple and Google," according to Enderle. - Reinvention - Veteran technology firms being overtaken by newcomers is not necessarily inevitable, if established companies have the wit and courage to re-invent themselves, adapting to survive. Analyst Kay noted IBM, a century-old technology company that has embraced transformation time and again, even shedding products along the way. Computer chip giant Intel shifted its focus to microprocessors for mobile devices to adapt to how internet-connected devices were evolving. Apple itself was a computer company on the brink of bankruptcy when it staked its future on iPods and iPhones in a winning move that made it one of the most profitable companies on the planet. The future is a question mark for Microsoft, once the world's largest company, which has fallen behind Apple and Google as the PC industry declines and which is refocusing on enterprise services. But reinvention isn't a cure-all, and needs ongoing commitment to change along with vision of where markets are heading. IBM now seems tangled in endless restructuring, with revenue declining for more than four years; Intel continues to struggle to find the kind of success it had with big computer chips. Analysts have taken to wondering whether Apple itself has become too dependent on the iPhone, and is taking too long to come up with "the next big thing." @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook Top Stories » Water fight could drench backpacker billAAP A stoush over water reform could sink the government's hopes of getting its backpacker tax through parliament. … VW to cut 30,000 jobs, 23,000 in GermanyAAP Kogan welcomes prospect of AmazonAAP Crean enlisted to help Latrobe ValleyAAP Sponsored  Market Data Currencies Currencies Name Price Change % Chg AUD / USD 0.7369 -0.0047 -0.63% AUD/USD AUD / GBP 0.5976 +0.0007 +0.12% AUD/GBP AUD / EUR 0.6952 -0.0025 -0.36% AUD/EUR Go To Currency Converter » On This Site HOME NEWS & OPINION TAX TIME 2016 INVESTING MY PORTFOLIOS PERSONAL FINANCE VIDEO Expert Opinion ALSO ON YAHOO7 Mail Stocks & Shares Forum Meet Single Women Meet Single Men TV Guide Easy Recipe Ideas Go Travelling Tips To Great Sex Breaking News Find Your Dream Car Weather Forecast Find A Job All Yahoo7 Services » Trending Now Golden pheasant Health insurance ISIS Melbourne Cheap international flights 457 visa program Mobile phone Leonard Cohen Adelaide Accommodation Brendan Dassey iPad Help / Suggestions Privacy Terms Quotes are real-time for NASDAQ, NYSE, and NYSEAmex when available.

Fahad Al Bannai, CEO of Axiom Telecom, said in a statement on Thursday that the UAE businesses that do not embrace mobile technology as part of their efforts to enhance the consumer experience risk being sidelined in today’s increasingly competitive environment. With the average person in the UAE now owning at least three connected devices at one time, according to Google’s latest Connected Consumer Survey, he said mobile technology is having a profound influence on the consumer decision-making process. According to the Google study, nearly two-thirds (63 per cent) of the UAE residents use their smartphones to search for local businesses. In addition, 84 per cent go online at least as often via a smartphone as a computer — a whopping 44 per cent increase since 2012, and more than three-quarters (76 per cent) of residents look to the internet when seeking information. However, traditional mobile technology is not the only way consumers connect with data services, as wearable and smart devices are also penetrating the way people live and interact. In GfK’s Connected Consumer Index 2016, the UAE scored 995 points, ranking behind Hong Kong and North America that ranked first and second respectively in the list of 78 countries. Globally, the average score in the index stood at 313, while for the Middle East and Africa region, it was at 127. “As our lives become increasingly connected to the devices we use on a daily basis, there is a shift in the way we connect to data services and consequently engage with our surroundings,” stated Al Bannai. “Today, UAE consumers live online. It’s the first place they turn to when seeking information or a service — and if your business is not there when they look, that is a lost opportunity. In today’s fast-paced and information-driven world, having a strong online presence is instrumental to the success of every business.” He said that people go online because they want to meet some of their basic universal needs, whether it is interpersonal connection, self-expression, exploration or for the sake of convenience. If brands and retailers manage are able to successfully tap into these personal motivators, they will have an incredible opportunity to reach consumers anytime, anywhere.

News Feature articles Blog posts Podcasts Shortbread Forums Google Translate gets a boost from deep neural networks by Eric Frederiksen  9:30 AM on September 29, 2016 Many of the technological nightmares we bring to life on film revolve around artificial intelligence gone wrong, usually somewhere around the year 2000. 2016 is almost over, though, and we don't live in a post-apocalyptic future—at least, not yet. AI still struggles to do things humans do with ease, like forming coherent sentences and playing games millions of people play easily. But Google has been making big strides in both of those areas this year. Case in point is a recent boost to Google Translate's performance thanks to deep neural networks. Earlier this year, one of Google's deep neural networks tackled one of the toughest puzzles in artificial intelligence research when it defeated Lee Sedol, a Korean grandmaster in the game of Go. Go is relatively simple to learn, but difficult to master thanks to an emphasis on intuition and strategies that can take many turns to play out. Compared to the eight-by-eight chess board, Go uses a 19x19 grid. Until this year, AI could beat only the most amateur of Go players. Now, Google has turned that same neural network technology toward language translation. Google says its technology—called Google Neural Machine Translation, or GNMT—reduces errors by 60 percent in Chinese translation while climbing even higher in other languages. If you're feeling brave, you can check out the complete paper Google published on the subject, but here's a short breakdown. As Science Magazine explains, the deep neural net uses a technology that Google's team calls vectors that seem to  give it more room to understand context. "Cat" is more likely to be associated with "Dog" than to "Car," for example. The system is trained on pairs of translated sentences, builds the vectors and compares the input against them to come up with a set of likely translations.  In contrast, Science Magazine notes that the translation method for most of the languages Translate offers today works based off of phrases. It takes user input and breaks it down into isolated chunks before it stitches together its best effort. This technique can create some truly outlandish results that are unusable at best and dangerous at worst, but it's the state of the art today. According to Science Magazine's report, the Google Brain team chose Chinese as its first language to work with, not only because a big part of the team is Chinese, but also because the language is considered one of the most difficult to machine translate. While the 60% improvement statistic above is for the tech's attempts to translate from English to Chinese, Google says results in translation from English to Spanish is 87% more accurate with the new system, and French to English is 83% better. Google tells Science Magazine that it's using GNMT to perform Chinese to English translation now, and it'll gradually roll out the technology to other languages in the future. We're not yet in the age of A Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy's Babel Fish or Doctor Who's TARDIS. Google's Mike Schuster, an engineer on the project and one of the lead authors on the paper Google released this week, acknowledged when speaking to Wired that what the team has now isn't perfect, but added that "it is much, much better" than existing tech. Google hasn't set a date on when we'll see the tech rolling out to other languages, but maybe the Babel Fish future isn't so far off.

Bear in mind that removing a penalty only devalues the bad links pointing to the site — it does not automatically boost your site back up in the rankings. If you have done nothing over the past two years other than trying to get links removed, you may only see a slight ranking adjustment, if it all. On the other hand, if you have been removing bad links while also acquiring good, new, links then you may see a more significant rankings adjustment.

How about that?” Story continues below READ MORE: Donald Trump’s net worth has fallen $800 million in last year, report says The Republican presidential candidate did not elaborate on what kind of stories he was referring to, nor did he cite a source to back up his claim. However, this isn’t the first time Google’s search results have been scrutinized. Earlier this month Sputnik News, a Russian state-owned news agency, published a report claiming Google showed bias towards Clinton in its search results. In August, the news agency ran a similar story after picking up on social media reports that Google showed different search results than Microsoft’s Bing search engine when users searched for information on Clinton’s health. Well this is odd. #HillarysHealth #HillaryClintonSearchTerms pic.twitter.com/AfjXNG9kET — Kassy Dillon (@KassyDillon) August 27, 2016 In June, a viral video titled “Did Google Manipulate Search for Hillary” also alleged Google’s Autocomplete feature censored negative search terms about Clinton. For example, the video alleged a Google search for “Hillary Clinton crime” showed results for “Hillary Clinton crime reform” and “Hillary Clinton crime bill 1994.” Whereas the same search on Yahoo search retried results like “Hillary Clinton criminal charges” and “Hillary Clinton crimes.” READ MORE: No public release, but Donald Trump has turned over tax returns to judges, banks Global News contacted Google regarding Trump’s comments, however, the company declined to comment. But Google has refuted these claims a number of times in the past. After that viral video was released, Google’s vice president of search Tamar Yehoshua released a blog post explaining how the Autocomplete feature works, noting that the feature is designed to avoid completing searches with results that are “offensive or disparaging.” “This filter operates according to the same rules no matter who the person is,” read the blog post. The company also noted that results are produced based on a number of factors including the “popularity and freshness” of search terms. WATCH: Donald Trump claims he won ‘every single online poll’ over presidential debate In a statement to The Washington Times, Google outright denied allegations that the feature favours any candidate or cause. “Google Autocomplete does not favor any candidate or cause. Claims to the contrary simply misunderstand how Autocomplete works. Our Autocomplete algorithm will not show a predicted query that is offensive or disparaging when displayed in conjunction with a person’s name,” Google said. “More generally, our autocomplete predictions are produced based on a number of factors including the popularity of search terms.” In the past, Trump has suggested that he fears the general election will be rigged and that the Democrats had fixed their primary system so Clinton could defeat Bernie Sanders. © 2016 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.

Posted 29 Sep 2016 22:25 Graphic depicts the range of sensor information feeding a new set of live traffic services Enlarge Caption  Email More A A PARIS/FRANKFURT: Alarmed by the threat posed by Silicon Valley firms developing autonomous driving systems, carmakers at this week's Paris Motor Show showed signs they are ready to hit back by cooperating in areas where they might have been expected to compete. "This is how the automotive industry may be able to fight off the threat that Apple and particularly Google represent to their brands as digital services become more and more important," technology investment analyst Richard Windsor said. BMW , Daimler and VW's Audi announced this week they would launch new traffic monitoring services next year which give drivers a view of road conditions miles ahead. They are based on video data collected from sensors in other cars and fed to the three carmakers' jointly-owned navigation mapping services firm HERE (http://reut.rs/2dabC1B). Separately HERE's Dutch rival TomTom NV on Thursday announced traffic data deals with truckmaker Volvo and carmaker Skoda, a VW subsidiary. Also General Motors , Nissan and VW are experimenting with a plan to pull video data captured by their customers' vehicles using Israeli firm Mobileye's camera-based sensor systems, that may soon give automakers an edge over the likes of Google in the precision-mapping required for driverless cars (http://reut.rs/2daj3Wr). However, it remains to be seen whether carmakers can charge premium prices for connected car services as technology companies like Google look to develop similar offerings for free, supported by advertising or other business models. A deal by traffic data start-up Inrix to supply data to Google-owned crowd-sourced traffic and navigation service Waze will help drivers find parking spots on smartphones using the free app. And Renault said on Thursday it was showing a prototype of a Waze system built into its car dashboards which run Android Auto, Google's operating system for carmakers. Meanwhile connecting cars on the move with the Internet also needs more reliable mobile telecoms networks. With that aim, Germany's top automakers said this week they were teaming up with telecoms network equipment makers Ericsson , Huawei , Nokia , Qualcomm and Intel to help with developing the next-generation 5G networks set to debut around 2020 (http://reut.rs/2dcPuCy). CAREFUL DRIVING At the same time carmakers are now racing to plot their courses to building self-driving vehicles over the next five years, a dramatic acceleration in pace from the 10- to 15-year timeframes many had charted until pushed to speed up the process by the advances made by Google and Tesla . "We see the car transforming from a product into the ultimate platform," Daimler Chairman Dieter Zetsche told reporters in Paris. Among the car companies there have been two camps, those who are trying to develop their autonomous driving technology in-house, and those who are outsourcing it, but that division is looking set to become less clear-cut due to the need for cooperation in some areas at least. "Gradually all of the car manufacturers will have to get more and more involved in managing data. It's natural. We're going to have to work much more collaboratively," Stewart Callegari, a Nissan product planning executive for driverless cars told reporters at the Paris show. Fiat's recent partnership to build self-driving vans with Google is seen by analysts as an example of outsourcing, given the Italian auto maker's weak finances, limiting its ability to invest in its own software expertise (http://reut.rs/1ZatE2c). Daimler, on the other hand, is firmly in the camp of vehicle makers who want to go it alone but still sees some need for collaboration. "We need to think whether we work together analyzing the data or whether we do this on our own. This depends on the use case," Zetsche said, adding that it made sense to work together in areas where potential cost savings resulted but did not blur the distinctions between brands. Some partnerships like the deal between Chinese carmaker Geely's Swedish subsidiary Volvo Car Group to develop autonomous cars with Uber Technologies , and General Motor's partnership with Uber's rival Lyft, are also seen as hybrid approaches. "The automotive industry has and will continue to become a software business in many ways," Audi of America President Scott Keogh told Reuters.

Advertisement Description Technical Change Log Comments How To Browse Privately In Google Chrome Google’s game changing browser Chrome combines sophisticated technology with a simple UI, to create a faster, safer and easier browsing experience. Launched in 2008, Google Chrome quickly dominated the browser market to become the most used browser globally within 4 years of its public release. Google’s rapid and continuous development cycle ensures the browser continues to compete with the other most popular and advanced web browsers available. Speed Perhaps the area Google invested most of its development time to differentiate from other browsers. Google Chrome launches extremely quickly from your desktop, runs applications at speed thanks to a powerful JavaScript engine and loads pages rapidly using the WebKit open source rendering engine. Add to this quicker search and navigation options from the simplified UI and you have a browser that is pretty hard to beat on speed, especially if gaming is your thing. Clean, simple UI Google Chrome’s most striking feature and a substantial factor in its popularity - the simple UI hasn’t changed much since the beta launch in 2008. Google focused on trimming down unnecessary toolbar space to maximise browsing real estate. The browser is made up of 3 rows of tools, the top layer horizontally stacks automatically adjusting tabs, next to a simple new tabs icon and the standard minimize, expand & close windows controls. The middle row includes 3 navigation controls (Back, Forward & Stop/Refresh), a URL box which also allows direct Google web searching and a star bookmarking icon. Extensions and browser settings icons line up to the right of the URL box. The third row is made up of bookmark folders and installed apps. Easily overlooked now, this clean UI was a breath of fresh air compared to the overcrowded toolbars of popular browsers pre-2008. Privacy Another hugely popular feature, Incognito mode allows you to browse privately by disabling history recording, reducing traceable breadcrumbs and removing tracking cookies on shutdown. Chrome’s settings also allow you to customize regular browsing privacy preferences. Security Chrome’s Sandboxing prevents malware automatically installing on your computer or affecting other browser tabs. Chrome also has Safe Browsing technology built in with malware and phishing protection that warns you if you encounter a website suspected of containing malicious software/activity. Regular automatic updates ensure security features are up to date and effective. Customization A vast selection of apps, extensions, themes and settings make your browsing experience unique to you. Improve productivity, security, navigation speed, pretty much anything you can think of with apps and extensions from the Google Chrome Store. Install themes created by top artists or make your own using mychrometheme.com.

The tech giant was the top-mentioned company among business-school students when asked where they’d most like to work, according to a new survey from Universum, a research and consulting firm. Google may be an obvious dream employer for techies and engineers — but what gives it such appeal among up and coming businesspeople? There are three big draws, says Dustin Clinard, Universum America’s managing director. The company has a much-loved brand, pursues diverse and ambitious projects, and offers a quirky and innovative workplace, Clinard says. Google’s moonshot projects, like self-driving cars and super-speed internet, give it “an inspiring purpose” that’s key for attracting young business talent, adds Clinard. Beyond Google, MBA students favored four prestigious consulting firms — McKinsey & Company, The Boston Consulting Group, Bain & Company and Deloitte. The major consultancies tend to maintain a big recruiting presence at top business schools, according to Clinard. McKinsey, for example, spends “a good amount of time on campus to make sure students are well-acquainted” with the firm, its work and people, company spokesperson DJ Carella told CNNMoney. Big-name consulting firms are often held in high regard at business schools, says Clinard, because they’re known for hiring the best people and for focusing on solving the world’s hardest problems. Indeed, the survey found 93% of MBA students are looking to “be competitively or intellectually challenged” at their first jobs. But they’re not necessarily looking to make huge sums of money right away. Only 13% of the MBA students cited becoming wealthy as an initial career goal. Still, they’re not expecting to be broke either. Survey respondents expect a starting salary of about $115,730 on average. They’re also not interested in following the path of Donald Trump or Carly Fiorina going from business to politics. About 77% of respondents said running for public office is not a career move they want to take on.

Enter Google Trips, which it calls a personalized tour guide in your pocket. Google has recently launched two new planning apps, including a messaging app Allo, which is voice-based. Together with Google trips, it takes the search-engine giant a step closer to becoming an answer engine connecting travellers to "their best travel experiences". This is according to Oliver Heckman, Google vice president of engineering for travel products. Speaking at the Skift Global Forum in New York City this week Heckman sees a future for Google Travel in its assistant tool for eventually booking flights, giving recommendations and helping to concisely plan itineraries — all over voice. Goggle's messaging app serves as this assistant in your pocket to help you find restaurants through various questions, enhancing its current offering to book flights and hotels without leaving the search engine. How does Google Trips work? Skift's Executive Editor Dennis Schaal and  Oliver Heckman, Google vice president of engineering Using a library of Google data combined with a user’s Gmail inbox to plan and create custom itineraries based on the time, place and weather of the place you find yourself in - it however has no booking functionality. The app has already received 500 000 downloads in the Google Play store and currently carries a 4.2 rating.  But unlike TripAdvisor who is aiming to close a loop within the 360°traveller journey by offering instant book - Google says it does not want to be an OTA. At least not officially it seems. TripAdvisor's instant booking capabilities in TripConnect, aims to add a seamless experience that allows travellers to research, choose and immediately book. It is connected to some of the major hotel chains as Instant Booking partners, as well as the online travel agency Booking.com.  While the move has affected the traveller review giant's bottom line as the shift from an advertising model to a booking engine hasn't been as seamless, the company remains committed to the application for the long term.  Tripadvisor committed to 'long-term benefit of instant booking'  Skift CEO Rafat Ali and  TripAdvisor CEO Stephen Kaufer Also speaking at the Skift Conference, TripAdvisor CEO Stephen Kaufer says the company's shareholders need to understand the focus is on the long-term. According to Kaufer, there are a number of long-term ideas ahead to improve the traveller journey, including voice search, making better recommendations and personalisation. This is evident with the site's Restaurant's near me functionality, also aimed at helping travellers have a better trip. And while some may question the authenticity and relevance of the lists in certain instances of recommendations, Kaufer says Tripadvisor is set on ensuring a broad-range of recommendations through its sub-categories. While one restaurant might be a local favourite because it serves the best pizza, that might not be the place to have the best meal on your honeymoon, was one example used by Kaufer. Based solely on these offerings from two of the leaders in online search and trip planning, it seems it boils down to voice and personalisation of choice in the app and service functionality game. But however fragmented the offerings, it's clear that all in all, it will ultimately benefit you the traveller.  What to read next on Traveller24: - WATCH: To infinity and beyond!

Amazon Announces New Fire TV Stick International Business Times 29/09/2016 Ken Manbert Salcedo © Provided by IBT US Amazon has announced a new version of its Fire TV Stick, a compact streaming dongle that’s a direct rival to Google’s Chromecast. The new streaming device comes with improved hardware, a more affordable price and will ship starting this October. The new Amazon Fire TV Stick comes with a 1.3GHz quad-core Cortex-A7 processor along with the Mali-450MP4 GPU. It’s also packing 1GB of RAM and 8GB of internal storage, according to GSMArena. Amazon claims that the new hardware should make the new dongle 30 percent faster than its predecessor. As for connectivity, it comes with 802.11ac Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.1 (upgraded from Bluetooth 3.0) support and an HDMI output. The new Fire TV Stick is also capable of laying H.265 (HEVC) video format. Unfortunately, the dongle is only capable of streaming full HD 1080p resolution videos. This will most likely not get the attention of users who’ve already invested in 4K TVs, especially now that Google is expected to announce a new Chromecast next week that’s capable of 4K streaming. One huge advantage of the new Fire TV Stick is its price tag. The dongle sells for just $39.99, far more affordable than the rumored $69 price tag of the upcoming Chromecast Ultra. As for software, the new Amazon Fire TV Stick will be running Fire OS 5, a modified version of Android 5.0 Lollipop. The dongle also lets users play games, which is yet another advantage over the Chromecast. Another feature that has made its way to the new dongle is the addition of Alexa, which can now be controlled by the included Alexa Voice Remote. Users would be able to ask Alexa to search for shows, movies, open apps and control playback, according to ArsTechnica. Users will simply have to press the mic button on the remote to initiate a voice command for Alexa. The new Fire TV Stick is now available to preorder from Amazon and is expected to start shipping on Oct. 20. Early birds will also be rewarded with free content from Amazon Video, Hulu and Sling TV, according to Engadget.

Ford was showing Reuther around his factory, proudly displaying all the new automating technologies he had introduced to replace human workers. Ford gloated, asking Reuther ‘How are you going to get those robots to pay union dues?’. Reuther responded with equal glee ‘Henry, how are you going to get them to buy your cars?’. The story is probably apocryphal, but it’s too good a tale to let truth get in the way. The story reveals a common fear about technology and the impact it will have on human society. The fear is something I call the ‘unsustainability problem’. The idea is that if certain trends in automation continue, and humans are pushed off more and more productive/decision-making loops, the original rationale for those ‘loops’ will disappear and the whole system will start to unravel. Is this a plausible fear? Is it something we should take seriously? I want to investigate those questions over the remainder of this post. I do so by first identifying the structure of the problem and outlining three examples. I then set out the argument from unsustainability that seems to follow from those examples. I close by considering potential objections and replies to that argument. My goal is not to defend any particular point of view. Instead — and as part of my ongoing work — I want to identify and catalogue a popular objection/concern to the development of technology and highlight its similarities to other popular objections. [Note: This is very much an idea or notion that I thought might be interesting. After writing it up, I'm not sure that it is. In particular, I'm not sure that the examples used are sufficiently similar to be analysed in the same terms. But maybe they are. Feedback is welcome] 1. Pushing Humans off the Loop Let’s start with some abstraction. Many human social systems are characterised by reciprocal relationships between groups of agents occupying different roles. Take the relationship between producers (or suppliers) and consumers. This is the relationship at the heart of the dispute between Ford and Reuther. Producers make or supply goods and services to consumers; consumers purchase and make use of the goods and services provided by the producers. The one cannot exist without the other. The whole rationale behind the production and supply of goods and services is that there is a ready and willing cadre of consumers who want those goods and services. That’s the only way that the producers will make money. But it’s not just that the producers need the consumers to survive: the consumers also need the producers. Or, rather, they need themselves to be involved in production, even if only indirectly, in order to earn an income that enables them to be consumers. I have tried to illustrate this in the diagram below. The problem alluded to in the story about Ford and Reuther is that this loop is not sustainable if there is too much automation. If the entire productive half of the loop is taken over by robots, then where will the consumers get the income they need to keep the system going? (Hold off on any answers you might have for now — I’ll get to some possibilities later) When most people think about the unsustainability problem, the production-consumption relationship is the one they usually have in mind. And when they think about that relationship, they usually only focus on the automation of the productive half of the relationship. But this is to ignore another interesting trend in automation: the trend towards automating the entire loop, i.e. production and consumption. How is this happening? The answer lies in the growth of the internet of things and the rise of ‘ambient payments’. Smart devices are capable of communicating and transacting with one another. The refrigerator in your home could make a purchase from the robot personal shopper in your local store. You might be the ultimate beneficiary of the transaction but you have been pushed off the primary economic loop: you are neither the direct producer nor the supplier. It’s my contention that it is this trend towards total automation that is the really interesting phenomenon. And it’s not just happening in the production-consumption loop either. It is happening in other loops as well. Let me give just two examples: the automation of language production and interpretation in the speaker-listener loop, and the automation of governance in the governor-governed loop. The production and interpretation of language takes place in a loop. The ‘speaker’ produces language that he or she wishes to cause some effect in the mind of the ‘listener’ — without the presumption of a listener there is very little point to the act. Likewise, the ‘listener’ interprets the language based on the presumption that there is a speaker who wishes to be understood, and based on what they have learned about the meaning of language from living in a community of other speakers and listeners. Language lives and breathes in a vibrant and interconnected community of speakers and listeners, with individuals often flitting back and forth between the roles. So there is, once again, a symbiotic relationship between the two sides of the loop. Could the production and interpretation of language be automated? It is already happening in the digital advertising economy. This is a thesis that Pip Thornton (the research assistant on the Algocracy and Transhumanism Project that I am running) has developed in her work. It is well known that Google makes its money from advertising. What is perhaps less well-known is that Google does this by commodifying language. Google auctions keywords to advertisers. Different words are assigned different values based on how likely people are to search for them in a given advertising area (space and time). The more popular the word in the search engine, the higher the auction value. Advertisers pay Google for the right to use the popular words in their adverts and have them displayed alongside user searches for those terms. This might sound relatively innocuous and uninteresting at first glance. Language has always been commodified and advertisers have always, to some extent, paid for ‘good copy’. The only difference in this instance is that it is Google’s PageRank algorithm that determines what counts as ‘good copy’. Where the phenomenon gets interesting is when you start to realise that this has resulted in an entire linguistic economy where both the production and interpretation of language is slowly being taken over by algorithms. The PageRank algorithm functions as the ultimate interpreter. Humans adjust their use of language to match the incentives set by that algorithm. But humans don’t do this quickly enough. An array of bots are currently at work stuffing webpages with algorithmically produced language and clicking on links in the hope that it will trick the ranking system. In very many instances neither the producers nor interpreters of advertising copy are humans. The internet is filled with oddly produced, barely comprehensible webpages whose linguistic content has been tailored to the preferences of machines. Humans web-surfers often find themselves in the role of archaeologists stumbling upon these odd linguistic tombs. Automation is also taking place in the governor-governed relationship. This is the relationship that interests me most and is the centrepiece of the project I’m currently running. I define a governance system as any system that tries to nudge, manipulate, push, pull, incentivise (etc.) human behaviour. This is a broad definition and could technically subsume the two relationships previously described. More narrowly, I am an interested in state-run governance systems, such as systems of democratic or bureaucratic control. In these systems, one group of agents (the governors) set down rules and regulations that must be followed by the others (the governed). It’s less easy to describe this as a reciprocal relationship. In many historical cases, the governors are rigidly separated from the governed and by necessity have significant power over them. But there is still something reciprocal about it. No one — not even the most brutal dictator — can govern for long without the acquiescence of the governed. The governed must perceive the system to be legitimate in order for it to work. In modern democratic systems this is often taken to mean that they should play some role in determining the content of the rules by which they are governed. I have talked to a lot of people about this over the years. To many, it seems like the governor-governed relationship is intrinsically humanistic in nature. It is very difficult for them to imagine a governance system in which either or both roles becomes fully automated. Surely, they say, humans will always retain some input into the rules by which they are governed? And surely humans will always be the beneficiaries of these rules? Maybe, but even here we see the creeping rise of automation. Already, there are algorithms that collect, mine, classify and make decisions on data produced by us as subjects of governance. This leads to more and more automation on the governor-side of the loop. But the rise of smart devices and machines could also facilitate the automation of the governed side of the loop. The most interesting example of this comes in the shape of blockchain governance systems. The blockchain provides a way for people to create smart contracts. These are automated systems for encoding and enforcing promises/commitments, e.g. the selling of a derivative at some future point in time. The subjects of these smart contracts are not people — at least not directly. Smart contracts are machine-to-machine promises. A signal that is recorded and broadcast from one device is verified via a distributed network of other computing devices. This verification triggers some action via another device (e.g. the release of money or property). As noted in other recent blog posts, blockchain-based smart contracts could provide the basis for systems of smart property (because every piece of property in the world is becoming a ‘smart’ device) and even systems of smart governance. The apotheosis of the blockchain governance ideal is the hypothetical distributed autonomous organisation (DAO) which is an artificial, self governing agent, spread out across a distributed network of smart devices. The actions of the DAO may affect the lives of human beings, but the rules by which it operates could be entirely automated in terms of their production and implementation. Again, humans may be indirect beneficiaries of the system, but they are not the primary governors or governed. They are bystanders. 2. The Unsustainability Argument Where will this process of automation bottom out? Can it continue indefinitely? Does it even make sense for it to continue indefinitely? To some, it is not possible to understand the trend toward total automation in terms of its causes and effects. To them, there is something much more fundamental and disconcerting going on. Total automation is a deeply puzzling phenomenon — something that cannot and should continue to the point where humans are completely off the loop. The Ford-Reuther story seems to highlight the problem in the clearest possible way. How can a capitalistic economy survive if there are no human producers and consumers? Surely this is self-defeating? The whole purpose of capitalism is to provide tools for distributing goods and services to the humans that need them. If that’s not what happens, then the capitalistic logic will have swallowed itself whole (yes, I know, this is something that Marxists have always argued). I call this the unsustainability problem and it can be formulated as an argument: (1) If automation trend X continues, then humans will be pushed off the loop. (2) The loop is unsustainable* without human participation. (3) Therefore, if automation trend X continues we will end up with something that is unsustainable*. You’ll notice that I put a little asterisk after unsustainable. That’s deliberate. ‘Unsustainable’ in this context is not to be understood in its colloquial sense, though it can be. Unsustainable* stands for a number of possible concerns. It could be literally unsustainable in the sense that the trend will eventually lead to some breaking point or crash point. This is common in certain positive feedback loops. For example, the positive feedback loop that causes the hyperinflation of currencies. If the value of a currency inflates like it did in Weimar Germany or, more recently, Zimbabwe, then you eventually reach a point where the currency is worthless in economic transactions. People have to rely on another currency or have recourse to barter. Either way, the feedback loop is not sustainable in the long-term. But unsustainable* could have more subtle meanings. It may be the trend is sustainable in the long-term (i.e. it could continue indefinitely) but if it did so you would radically alter the value or meaning that attached to the activities in the loop. So much so that they would seem pointless or no longer worthwhile. To give some examples, the unsustainability argument applied to the producer-consumer case might involve literal unsustainability, i.e. the concern might be that it will lead to the capitalistic system breaking down; or it might be that it will radically alter the value of that system, i.e. it might force a change in the system of private property. In the case of the speaker-listener loop, the argument might be that automation misses the point of what a language is, i.e. that a language is necessarily a form of communication between two (or more) conscious, intentional agents. If there are no conscious, intentional agents involved, then you no longer have a language. You might have some form of machine-to-machine communication, but there is no reason for that to take the form of language. 3. Should the Unsustainability Problem Concern Us? I want to close with some simple critical reflections on the unsustainability argument. I’ll keep these fairly general. First, I want to talk a bit more about premise (1). There are various ways in which this may be false. The simple fact that there is automation of the tasks typically associated with a given activity does not mean that humans will be pushed off the loop. As I’ve highlighted on other occasions, the ‘loops’ referred to in debates about technology are complicated and break down into multiple sub-tasks and sub-loops. Take the production side of the producer-consumer relationship. Productive processes can usually be broken down into a series of stages which often have an internal loop-like structure. If I own a business that produces some widgets, I would usually start the productive process by trying to figure out what kinds of widgets are needed in the world, I would then acquire the raw materials needed to make those widgets, develop some productive process, release the widgets to the consumers, and then learn from my mistakes/successes in order to refine and improve the process in the future. When we talk about the automation of production, there is a tendency to ignore these multiple stages. It’s rare for them all to be automated, consequently it’s likely that humans will retain some input into the loops. Another way of putting this point is to say that technology doesn’t replace humans; itdisplaces them, i.e. changes the ecology in which they operate so that they need to do new things to survive. People have been making this point for some time in the debate about technology and unemployment. The introduction of machines onto the factory floors of Ford Motor Cars didn’t obviate the need for human workers; it simply changed what kinds of human workers were needed (skilled machinists etc.). But it is important that this displacement claim is not misunderstood. It doesn’t mean that there is nothing to worry about or that the displacement won’t have profound or important consequences for the sustainability of the relevant phenomenon. The human input into the newly automated productive or consumptive processes might be minimal: very few workers might be needed to maintain production within the factory and there might be limited opportunity for humans to exercise choice or autonomy when it comes to consumer-related decisions. Humans may be involved in the loops but be reduced to relatively passive roles within them. More radically, and possibly more interestingly, the automation trends may subsume humans themselves. In other words, the humans may not be displaced by technology; they may become the technology itself. This relates to the plausibility of premise (2). This may also be false, particularly if unsustainability is understood in its literal sense. For example, I don’t see any reason to think that the automation of language production and interpretation in online advertising cannot continue. It may prove frustrating for would-be advertisers, and it may seem odd to the humans who stand on the sidelines watching the system unfold, but the desire for advertising space and the scarcity of attention suggests to me that, if anything, there will be a doubling down on this practice in the future. This will certainly alter the activity and rob it of some of its value, but there will still be the hope that you can find someone that is paying attention to the process. The same goes for the other examples. They may prove sustainable with some changed understanding of what makes them worthwhile and how they affect their ultimate beneficiaries. The basic income guarantee, for instance, is sometimes touted as a way to keep capitalism going in the face of alleged unsustainability. Two other points before I finish up. Everything I have said so far presumes that machines themselves should not be viewed as agents or objects of moral concern — i.e. that they cannot directly benefit from the automation of production and consumption, or governance or language. If they can — and if it is right to view them as beneficiaries — then the analysis changes somewhat. Humans are still pushed off the loop, but it makes more sense for the loops to continue with automated replacements. Finally, as I have elaborated it, the unsustainability problem is very similar to other objections to technology, including ones I have covered in the recent past. It is, in many ways, akin the outsourcing and competitive cognitive artifacts objections that I covered here and here. All of these objections worry about the dehumanising potential of technology and the future relevance of human beings in the automated world. The differences tend to come in how they frame the concern, not in its ultimate contents.

ADVERTISEMENT Donald Trump has accused Google of manipulating its search results in favour of his Presidential rival, Hillary Clinton. Snapchat barges its way into the US elections Snapchat barges its way into the US elections Elections 28 Sep 2016 When discussing polling numbers at a rally in Wisconsin earlier this week, Trump mentioned that the search engine was suppressing negative news about the Democratic candidate. Read more From Nasa to climate change: how the Trump presidency will impact science, tech and culture From Nasa to climate change: how the Trump presidency will impact science, tech and culture By James Temperton “The Google poll had us leading Hillary by two points nationwide,” said Trump. “And that’s despite the fact Google’s search engine was suppressing the bad news about Hillary Clinton, how about that? How about that?” Though he wouldn’t explain what he meant, in June a video went viral making similar allegations. Titled, “Did Google Manipulate Search for Hillary?” the YouTube channel SourceFed alleged that Google’s Autocomplete feature predicted inoffensive searches when given words triggered by queries such as “hillary clinton indictment” and “hillary clinton crimes”. Google retaliated to the claims, telling The Washington Times: “Google Autocomplete does not favour any candidate or cause. Claims to the contrary simply misunderstand how Autocomplete works.” The Silicon Valley company recently launched the “Google Trends Election Hub” to offer a “real-time pulse” based on what people are searching for about the election, so it’s no wonder Trump is concerned about how he may be appearing on the search engine. This is not the first time a tech company has been accused of bias. Facebook’s Trending Topics changed earlier this year after allegations that its employees may have shown “isolated” bias when choosing stories to be including in the sidebar. ADVERTISEMENT Gizmodo reported that stories about conservative topics and candidates, such as Mitt Romney and Rand Paul, had been suppressed. As a result of this, Facebook removed its trending team and has replaced it with an algorithm. Since then, it has been beset with problems such as fake stories trending now that humans are not overseeing the process.

"The Google poll" "A new post-debate poll that just came out, the Google poll, has us leading Hillary Clinton by two points nationwide, and that's despite the fact that Google search engine was suppressing the bad news about Hillary Clinton," Trump said at the speech in Waukesha, Wisconsin. "How about that. How about that." What is "the Google poll"? As flagged by The Washington Post, it appears to be this Independent Journal Review poll conducted by Google Consumer Surveys. (IJR is a right-leaning blog; Google Consumer Surveys is a poll service of debatable quality.) The second part of that sentence, referring to Google "suppressing the bad news about Hillary Clinton," seems to refer to a widely discredited viral conspiracy claiming Google hid negative autocomplete results about Clinton. Typing "Hillary Clinton cr," for example, did not return an autocomplete for "Hillary Clinton crimes." Soon after the video was posted, the debunking started, and Google pointed out that it tries to remove disparaging search results for anyone, Clinton or otherwise. Others pointed out that typing in only "Hillary" followed by negative searches still returned disparaging autocomplete results. That debunking didn't make it into Trump's speech.

Mother-of-four Dawn Barber, 54, from Cheshire set up UKTights.com with her husband in 2005 as she wanted a 'low maintenance' way of making money. Now UKTights.com is the world's largest distributor of hosiery and is making £2 million a year. Scroll down for video  Mother-of-four Dawn Barber, 54, from Cheshire set up UKTights.com in 2005 as she wanted a 'low maintenance' way of making money while on maternity leave In 2005, Dawn who was bringing up three sons Kyle, Callum and Alex and running a telemarketing business, discovered she fell pregnant with her fourth child. She knew it wouldn't be feasible to make sales calls with a newborn baby, but was nervous about giving up work completely.  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next How Zara solved the mystery of what women want: Shock horror...

Share this article Share So her husband Jonathan, a computer programme, suggested a small business to keep active and bring in a little extra money and set up a website.  'I love tights and so I thought they would be fun to sell as they don't take up much room and are easy to send,' Dawn recalled. 'So I contacted some brands about becoming a re-seller.' Mother-of-four Dawn started her business from her home and it's now the world's largest supplier of tights  Dawn launched her business six weeks before her daughter Poppy was born. Her husband used Google's Digital Garage platform, which offers free tools to entrepreneurs and small businesses, to learn about online advertising and developed a strategy.  After two weeks, they received six orders in one day and as Jonathan continued to pick up new tips from Google they gained more customers.  Dawn with her youngest child. She set up her business six weeks before Poppy was born and now it's grown into a hugely successful company  Dawn with her daughter Poppy, 10, on holiday in Mauritius. Her business is family run so even on holiday she checks in with work every few hours  Callum, Dawn's second son, and her daughter Poppy. The whole family have some level of involvement with the tights business 'Each month we just grew and grew. It got to the stage where I was carrying a child on my hip whilst completing online orders, and in the evenings we would all be sat around the TV sealing envelopes and sticking return labels on,' Dawn recalled. 'I remember at one point we had to order a take-away because our house became so full of boxes of tights, we couldn't get to the cooker.' She puts the success of the business down to doing her market research and listening to the customers.  UKtights was set up in Dawn's front room and now stocks 28,000 different variations of tights Oxford graduate Callum, 23, occasionally does some copy writing for the family business 'There were two main competitors when we first started,' Dawn said. 'I did a lot of research and even ordered from them to see how they operated.  'I knew to be successful we not only needed to offer a big range but excellent customer service was essential and it's still one of our biggest attributes that we invest a lot of time into keeping at the highest possible standard 'At the start, we would get lots of enquiries from people explaining what they felt was missing in the industry, what they wanted us to stock and what they couldn't find. Kyle, 25, Dawn's eldest son, is the operations and marketing manager at UKTights  Dawn with (left to right) her sons Callum and Alex, husband Jonathan, daughter Poppy and son Kyle  The mother-of-four puts the success of her business down to listening to her customers' needs So I made sure I did what was asked of them and if we didn't have what they wanted I went out and got it for them. This then led us to offering a massive variety of brands and styles which gives customers choice.'  After growing by 100 per cent in the first two years, the Barbers moved the business into a commercial premises.  Poppy, 10, has played her part in the family business by modelling some of the children's ranges  Four years into the business they set up UKSwimwear. In 2015 they launched a lingerie site, UKLingerie, and are currently planning a move into active wear. The company are on course to turn over £2 million this year, a record profit to date and bought out their biggest competitor. They have 12 members of full-time staff, 60+ brands, 1,400 products and over 28,000 variations of products. But it's still very much a family business with Dawn and Jonathan working full-time for the company along with their oldest son Kyle, 25.  He works as the marketing and operations manager and his girlfriend is the customer services manager.  Their son Callum helps with copy writing and Alex is also keen to join the family business, while 10-year-old Poppy has modelled their children's ranges. 'We never tried to position ourselves against the competitors as they were big and we were small,' Dawn said. 'We liked that people saw us as a family-run business and we still do, even though we've grown.' Despite her success, Dawn hasn't taken a back seat and works 50 to 60 hours a week running her flourishing company  Alex, 18, has just finished school and is also hoping to join the family business However, she admits that being so hands-on requires a lot of dedication.   'It's been a fantastic experience but for people looking to start a business you have to be prepared to invest the time,' Dawn said. 'We didn't have much of a social life for a while and I still work between 50 and 60 hours a week, but I really enjoy it which helps.  Dawn juggled raising her daughter POppy and three other children with building a successful business 'Even when we go on holiday the laptops come with us and we log on every couple of hours to make sure everything is running smoothly and there are no issues.  'We realise it's a sacrifice but we want the business to continue growing and doing well so it's something we are prepared to do. Success doesn't simply come because you've started a business – it's successful because you work hard.'  Dawn is also proud of influencing brands to cater for plus size customers.   'When I first started the business it seemed only the likes of M&S had options for bigger women,' she said.  'It was also so uncomfortable and unflattering. So I went on a mission to really push brands I was dealing with to extend their lines.  'Now pretty much every brand has invested in new machinery to cater for the market and most now offer a plus-size tight which is fantastic to see. We now stock sizes up to 32.'      Share or comment on this article e-mail 278 shares Most watched News videos Autistic boy bursts into tears on stage as teacher snatches microphone Mob storm police station and lynch suspected paedophile Good pup!

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it Orbital Insight uses algorithms to calculate how much oil is in tanks by examining roofs, which rise and fall depending on how much oil is being stored. (Orbital Insight/ satellite imagery: DigitalGlobe/Orbital Insight/ satellite imagery: DigitalGlobe) By Steven Mufson September 29 Follow @StevenMufson One of the mysteries of the oil market is the question of how much crude oil China has squirreled away in commercial and strategic stockpiles. Now a satellite-imaging firm called Orbital Insight claims to have an answer. It says Chinese inventories in May stood at 600 million barrels, substantially more than commonly thought and nearly as much as the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Chinese storage capacity, which includes working inventory, is four times widely used estimates, Orbital Insight says, adding that the firm has not only counted storage tanks but has also used imaging techniques to figure out how much oil is in the tanks. The issue could influence expectations in oil markets. If China has built larger reserves than previously estimated, that means much of what looked like oil demand over the past couple of years was not a result of higher consumption but of strategic planning. It would make OPEC’s task of cutting output to drive up prices­ more difficult. And it could provide a buffer for China in the event of a sudden disruption in imported supplies. The new estimate comes from a firm founded by James Crawford, who formerly worked on Google’s book-scanning project. Crawford said that he recruited some NASA scientists and left Google to start Orbital Insight because the price of Earth-orbiting hardware was falling and the amount of satellite images was booming. He has received backing from the investment firms Sequoia and Google Ventures. The firm pays a percentage of its revenue to satellite-image providers. “The broad vision is to take large volumes of satellite imagery and make sense of what we’re doing on the Earth and what we’re doing to the Earth,” Crawford said. For its Chinese analysis, Crawford said the firm went back to images taken from 2010 to 2014 and counted the number of oil storage tanks built and destroyed and came up with a figure of 2,100 storage tanks, far more than the 500 tanks in the industry standard database in TankTerminals.com. Orbital Insight also used its own algorithms to calculate how much was in the tanks by examining their roofs, which rise and fall depending on how much oil is being stored. “As the reservoirs are filled and emptied, the roofs rise and fall, reflected in the crescent moon-like shadows from the walls of the reservoir,” the company said in a release. Orbital Insight honed this technique on about 6,000 tanks in the United States, comparing its figures with those of the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Recently the firm said it could come up with statistics faster than the International Energy Agency, something that could be valuable to oil traders — customers the firm is trying hard to woo. The firm, however, cannot discern whether there are underground storage facilities. Orbital Insight’s estimate far exceeds the figure given in a rare glimpse of China’s oil supplies by its government. On Sept. 2, the state-owned Xinhua news agency reported that China had 287 million barrels of oil in strategic storage sites in eight cities as well as in commercial facilities at the beginning of the year. Started in 2004, the Chinese strategic stockpile would be enough to cover only 36 days of oil imports, Xinhua said, based on data from the China National Petroleum Corp.’s Research Institute of Economics and Technology. China’s goal is to have large enough strategic stockpiles to cover 100 days of imports, a target the government’s five-year plan said might not be completed by the 2020 goal. The U.S. reserve is large enough to cover about 150 days of imports. However, with low prices, China has been on a buying spree, many analysts believe. Investment banks and other analysts have estimated that China has been importing 600,000 to 1.2 million barrels a day more than it needs for consumption. If China has just been bargain hunting, it could cut imports and help keep prices low. Or it could press ahead to reach its 100-day goal. If Orbital Insight is right, that could be closer than anyone thought. business economy true Please provide a valid email address. Sign up You’re all set!

SUBSCRIBE Ladislao José Biro Google doodle honors the inventor of the ballpoint pen A journalist by trade, Biro received a patent for the ballpoint pen in 1938. Amy Gesenhues on September 29, 2016 at 9:00 am More Today’s Google doodle marks the 117th birthday of Ladislao José Bíro, the man responsible for the ballpoint pen. Working with his brother, Google says Bíro introduced the first ballpoint pen at the Budapest International Fair in 1931. Eight years later, he would receive a patent for his invention. He worked with his brother, György Bíro, a chemist, to develop a new type of pen made up of a ball that turned in a socket. As the ball turned, it picked up ink from a cartridge and rolled to deposit it on paper, much like a newsprint roller transfers an inked image to paper. Google Doodle Blog The logo leads to a search for “Ladislao José Bíro” and includes the usual sharing icon. Google also shared the initial sketches of the doodle on the Google Doodle Blog: Born into a Jewish family in Budapest, Hungary, Bíro worked as a journalist — which is where he would eventually get the idea to take the newspaper printing process and apply it to a writing tool that used a ball turning in a socket to transfer ink onto paper.

SUBSCRIBE Updating your SEM toolbox with new, shiny tools –- SMX East 2016 Ask any PPC professional the secret of their success, and they'll often point to tools that help them do their jobs better. Columnist Pauline Jakober recaps a session at SMX East where the best of these tools were discussed. Pauline Jakober on September 29, 2016 at 8:00 am More Ask any PPC manager how they do their job well, and, aside from their skill set, they’ll name the tools that give them the data they need and the time in their day to drive strategy. In this session from SMX East 2016: “Updating Your SEM Toolbox with New, Shiny Tools,” Moderator Matt Van Wagner of Find Me Faster was joined by speakers Brad Geddes (@bgTheory) of AdAlysis, Daniel Gilbert (@dangilbertppc) of Brainlabs and Sahil Jain (@sahilio) of AdStage to share what SEM tools they rely on, and what shiny new tools they are most excited about. Secrets of PPC productivity First up was Brad Geddes with the secrets of PPC productivity, and he contends that time management is the key to good PPC management. There are so many tools out there, he says, and success is often determined not by what you use but when you use them. Geddes believes that collaboration tools should be considered PPC tools — this includes things like Basecamp, Google Docs and more, because PPC managers have difficulty finding the time to fully give their attention to doing the important work of building campaigns. Productivity is a challenge because we get interrupted often. He shares a post from Trello on finding productive hours in the day. PPC professionals have to be both managers and makers. So it’s important to find a schedule that works to your advantage. Here’s a sample below from Trello’s blog post: Some tips from Brad that work for him include: Keep a clean office. One monitor is better than two. Keep your computer desktop clean. Subscribe to SearchCap to stay on top of search news. One-fifth of his email replies are machine-written — things like “done,” “I will take care of it” and “What do you think?” Make meeting rules, and remember: Attending a meeting should not be viewed as an obstacle to be overcome; attending a meeting should be a privilege because you’re helping shape the direction of a company or its products and services Use a project management tool — there isn’t a right one or wrong one, but there should be one that helps your team be more productive Track time to find inefficiencies: Why does someone take double the time to do the same task compared to someone else? Optimize customer support and client calls, and consider making a video to include in your FAQs if your clients ask  the same questions over and over. Finally, when determining what tools you need: Determine your process first. Ask yourself what you need to do. Figure out how often you need to do it. Look at how long it takes. Then, decide what tools fit each task The full slide deck from Brad’s presentation can be found here. Free SEM tools Up next, Sahil Jain talked about the free SEM tools you should be using. Keyword research Ubersuggest: Enter root keywords and get all variations, as well as ad group themes. Soovle: Gives you an idea of what certain keyword searches look like across various sites like Google, Amazon, YouTube and others. WordStream Keyword Niche Finder: This tool breaks down keywords into possible niches to give you ideas that are more specific. Google Trends: Uncover popular searches, as well as seasonal searche.s Answer the Public: Based on Google autosuggest data, search queries populate popular searches in the form of questions. Search Cloudlet: This is a Firefox add-on that inserts smart tag clouds into the Google/Yahoo/Twitter interface to help you search faster — and the tag clouds reveal better search terms. 5minutesite.com’s local keywords list: Great for local businesses or small businesses. Enter root keywords plus ZIP code and radius to get a list of keywords plus names of surrounding locations. Keyword wrapping mergewords.com: Combine sets of words automatically. SEO Book’s PPC Ad Wrapper: A better wrapper, separates out things by match type. Ad copy tools Google AdWords preview tool to review competitor ads. Quick character counters like Word Counter or Google Sheets using the equation: =len(cell #) to count character length. CoSchedule’s headline analyzer and grader. Testing Perry Marshall’s split testing tool Broken link checkers: Xenu’s Link Sleuth and an AdWords Script link checker The full slide deck from Sahil’s presentation can be found here. Maximizing activity with your PPC toolset Last but not least was Daniel Gilbert, who talked about maximizing your effectiveness through the PPC tool set. He starts by saying that automation is not optional, it’s a must. One small account can have 10,000 keywords and a trillion data points. There are many tools out there: But in this interactive session, Daniel wants to poll the audience to see what their favorite tools are in multiple categories, then he’ll reveal his. And he said if his choices don’t match the audience, he’ll remove his clothes (update: he only removed his sweatshirt). Call tracking Audience picks: DialogTech, Marchex, CallRail Daniel’s choice: CallTrackingMetrics, CallRail, ResponseTap Feed management Audience picks: Whoop! App, Channel Intelligence Daniel’s choice: GoDataFeed, FeedSpark, Productsup Competitor insights Audience picks: SpyFu, SEMrush, Adgooroo Daniel’s choice: Adgooroo, Adthena, SEMrush Important: There isn’t any tool out there that will estimate your competitor ad spend! Account management Audience picks: WordStream, AdAlysis, Brainlabs Daniel’s choice: WordStream, Optymzr Reporting Audience picks: Supermetrics, Raven Daniel’s choice: Swydo, Supermetrics, Periscope Data Attribution Audience picks: Google Analytics, Visual IQ, Adometry (now Google Attribution 360) Daniel’s choice: Google Analytics, Abakus, CUBED Attribution The full slide deck from Daniel’s presentation can be found here.

Lifestyle Tech Features T3 Awards: Tech companies hold their own Oscars, featuring the best products of the year The awards like to think of themselves as the tech's Academy Awards, giving out prizes to the best products and the people who made them David Phelan Thursday 29 September 2016 11:14 BST Click to follow The Independent Tech will.i.am takes part in an interview on stage as he wins the Tech Personality of the Year Award at the T3 Gadget Awards 2016 Tim P. Whitby/Getty Images What makes a great gadget? A must-have innovation? A slick interface? Killer design? Last night in London, technology magazine T3 revealed its gadgets of the year and, since this was the magazine’s tenth year of awards, its gadget of the decade. That, it turned out, was the iPhone, which can fairly be said to have ticked all the boxes above. Its innovative streak began with the first iPhone, first sold in 2007, when it brought us the pinch-to-zoom effect we now take for granted. The iPhone won through votes from T3 Magazine’s readers. T3 is one of several awards nights coming up in the next few weeks, all of which put the year’s releases into sharp relief. Next is the What Hi-Fi Awards, a mammoth event with over 100 winners including, I kid you not Best AV Cable. Best of all, there’s the Pocket-lint Awards which are unique in polling opinions from, and inspiring lively discussion between, a wider range of technology journalists, including the Independent.

And as the star told the Independent last night, he’s hard at work improving the skillset for Aneeda, the voice-activated interface that powers gadgets like the dial, his smart cuff and developing the handsome Bluetooth headphones that come with it. There were also personality awards to Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales and Eben Upton, founder of Raspberry Pi and award presenters included BBC stalwarts Rory Cellan-Jones and (best of all), Johnny Ball, who had more energy, wit and charm than anyone else on stage. Read more Apple iPhone awarded ‘gadget of the decade’, but new one misses out Among products garlanded were the Naim Mu-so Qb, a small but extremely powerful wireless speaker that sounds tremendous for a one-box system. Replaceable grilles mean you can choose from blue, red, orange or black as the colour for your hi-fi – the Qb offers killer design thanks to a distinctive aluminium heat sink at its back and a deeply attractive, tactile touchscreen dial. Naim has built amazing sound into the Qb, and while it’s not cheap (£595) compared to Naim’s high-end models which can run to £100,000, it’s something of a bargain. Apple didn’t win Phone of the Year, one of T3’s most-anticipated gongs, which went to Samsung for its Galaxy S7 edge smartphone. I think the latest handset, the Galaxy Note 7 is even better, but as it’s only now becoming available after the battery-related product recall, this is a deserved win. Samsung had a good night overall, thanks to winning Brand of the Year and the award for Wearable Technology of the Year for its Gear S2 watch. And if you like that, the soon-to-be-released S3 is a real leap forward, so it may figure in next year’s awards. Sony was a big winner, too, grabbing camera of the year for the Sony A7R II, a spectacularly good mirrorless camera with 42.2MP sensor and great performance. And it took home the award for the best TV, the XD93. That’s a great TV but more recent models from Panasonic and indeed Sony, raise the bar much higher so, again, expect more awards to follow for these brands. There were awards for less obvious candidates, too, so the Connected Home Tech of the Year went to Dyson for the Pure Cool Link fan which cools the air as it purifies it, all controllable from a smartphone. And the Ring Video Doorbell which lets you see who’s at the door from your smartphone screen whether your six feet or 6,000 miles away, won the Editor’s Choice Award. The very top accolade, Gadget of the Year, presented in association with EE went to HTC for its amazing Vive Virtual Reality system. The same product also won Gaming Product of the Year. T3’s judges included the magazine’s staff, plus tech industry cognoscenti such as the Sun’s Daniel Jones and Hannah Bouckley from Press Association. I may not have agreed with every choice but the awards provide a key insight into the trends and highlights of the tech world.

[Full size 1 2] Image by Lawrence Alexander. In April of this year, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty and the Guardian reported on the website вштабе.рф, a large photo gallery of pro-Russian memes and “demotivator” graphics. Most of these crude caricatures ridicule US, Western, and Ukrainian leaders, whilst portraying Vladimir Putin as strong and heroic. The site gives no credit or attribution for its design, and offers no indication as to who might be behind it. Intrigued by this anonymity, I used Maltego open-source intelligence software to gather any publicly-available information that might provide clues. The Secrets of Google Analytics My use of Maltego revealed that the site was running Google Analytics, a commonly used online analytics tool that allows a website owner to gather statistics on visitors, such as their country, browser, and operating system. For convenience, multiple sites can be managed under a single Google analytics account. This account has a unique identifying “UA” number, contained in the Analytics script embedded in the website's code. Google provides a detailed guide to the system's structure. Google Analytics account number for вштабе.рф, found at the bottom of the page's HTML code. Journalists and security experts have already raised the potential of this code to link anonymous websites to particular users. The method was reported by Wired in 2011, and cited by FBI cyber crime expert Michael Bazzell in his book Open Source Intelligence Techniques. Several free services have sprung up that allow easy reverse searching of Google Analytics ID numbers, one of the most popular being sameID.net. I wanted to see whether the person or organisation behind вштабе.рф was running any other sites from the same Analytics account. Viewing thewebsite's source code gave me the all-important Google Analytics ID number. When I performed a broader search on it, the results were surprising—it was linked to no less than seven other websites (archived copy). These included whoswho.com.ua (archive), apparently aimed at collating compromising information on Ukrainian officials, whilst purporting to be a Ukrainian project; Zanogo.com (archive), another repository of memes, many anti-Western; and yapatriot.ru (archive), which appears to be an attempt to discredit Russian opposition figures. Another of the websites using the same Analytics account was syriainform.com (archive), a site seemingly promoting an anti-US and pro-Assad slant on events in Syria. Most striking of all was the presence of Material Evidence—a website for the touring photo exhibition that has featured in several media investigations into its alleged pro-Kremlin connections. In 2014, Gawker reported on the New York show, commenting on its large, well-funded advertising campaign. They noted that its website was registered in St. Petersburg, which is confirmed by historic WHOIS records. Down the Rabbit Hole Whilst investigating the network of sites tied to account UA-53176102, I discovered that one, news-region.ru, had also been linked to a second Analytics account: UA-53159797 (archive). This number, in turn, was associated with a further cluster of nineteen pro-Kremlin websites. Subsequent examinations of these webpages revealed three more Analytics accounts, with additional sites connected to them. Below is a network diagram of the relationships I have established to date. Relationships between the websites and their Google Analytics account numbers. [Full size] Image by Lawrence Alexander.One of the websites in this larger network, emaidan.com.ua (archive) appears at first glance to be a legitimate information resource for the Ukrainian protest movement. But closer inspection shows it is laced with rising anti-Ukrainian sentiment, as if written by a disillusioned former Maidan supporter. putininfo.com (archive) is a glowing tribute to the Russian president, complete with “My Putin” social media accounts. At the time of writing, the Analytics codes remain unchanged and visible on most of these sites. My findings can easily be verified by viewing their source code, either in the browser or by saving the page and viewing it in a text editor. Besides Google Analytics, the websites had some other common traits: shared use of Yandex Metrika, Yandex Verification, and a Nginx server—all Russian-made tools—characterized the sites in the network. It became clear that I was most likely looking at a large, well-organised online information campaign. But whilst the Google Analytics code demonstrated shared involvement in and management of the websites, it couldn't tell me who was behind them. A Personal Connection? Spurred on by curiosity, I did a little more digging through publicly available information. Domain registration records in several places [1 2 3] revealed a second common factor: the e-mail address terder.n@gmail.com. [Archive: 1 2 3 4]. I found it to be associated not only with the majority of sites I had already identified, but also with a new group of websites, apparently still under construction. Their titles suggested themes similar to the existing network: either overt pro-Russian polemic, or more subtle disinformation under the guise of legitimate Ukrainian journalism. They included antiliberalism.com, dnepropetrovsknews.com and maidanreload.com. It took less than a minute of searching to link the e-mail address to a real identity. A group on Russian social networking site VKontakte [archive] lists it as belonging to one Nikita Podgorny. Podgorny's public Facebook profile shows he is a member of a group called Worldsochi—the exact same name as one of the websites linked by the two Google Analytics codes I examined. Nikita Podgorny's membership of Worldsochi Facebook group. Podgorny has a Pinterest account with only one pin [archive]—an infographic of Russia's space accomplishments taken from a site called infosurfing.ru. Whilst infosurfing.ru doesn't have an embedded Google Analytics code, it shares some similarities in image construction with several sites in the pro-Kremlin network. The online FotoForensics tool shows that images from infosurfing.ru [1 2 3], putininfo.com [1 2] and вштабе.рф [1 2] contain metadata sourced from the exact same version of software: Adobe XMP Core: 5.5-c014 79.151481, 2013/03/13-12:09:15. By itself this is not a unique identifier, but it might be suggestive of a connection, especially in the context of additional information about Podgorny's online persona. Most notably, Podgorny is listed in the leaked employee list of St. Petersburg's Internet Research Agency, the pro-Kremlin troll farm featured in numerous news reports and investigations, including RuNet Echo's own reports. Podgorny's date of birth, given on his public VK profile, is an exact match for that shown in the leaked document. Podgorny's date of birth, as shown on his VK profile, compared with listing in the leaked Internet Reseach Agency document. Podgorny is also VK friends with Igor Osadchy, who is named as a fellow employee in the same list. Osadchy has denied working for the Internet Reseach Agency, calling the leaks an “unsuccessful provocation.” Nikita Podgorny's VK association with Igor Osadchy. When contacted by Global Voices, Podgorny neither confirmed nor denied involvement in the websites, and would not comment further. In the next post on the pro-Kremlin website network, we will look in more detail at the content, the aims, and the ideology behind the websites.

Теперь я видел всё. NATO loving trolls are morons If I had a penny for each and every time over the last year that I, an American citizen since birth, have been called a ‘putinbot’, a ‘Russian’, or some other such nonsense by Right Wing nitwits, then I would be richer than Donald Trump himself. Invariably what sets these morons off is simply the reality of somebody opposing more US Pentagon war making in Ukraine, which they do support. It reminds me of when people used to be called ‘nigger lovers’ all the time if they were not racist in the South. Now you are called a ‘putinbot’ instead. This commentary we are replying to feeds the nonsense of all these Right Winger morons that tell me I am supposedly paid to post online. IDIOTS! guest “an American citizen since birth” As if an American citizen could not be a pro-Kremlin idiot or a traitor to his nation. LES1 Gee ??? I guess that rather than being called a kremlinoid or a member of Putin’s “TV tribe”, he prefers to be called a “malicious useful idiot” or a plain Benedict Arnold ?? PS The Russian army invaded and stole land and resources from Ukraine and he has the audacity to state : “US Pentagon war making in Ukraine” !!! PPS Savchuk’s revelations about the agency have fascinated Russia not because they are shocking but because they confirm what everyone has long suspected: The Russian Internet is awash in trolls. “This troll business becomes more popular year by year,” says Platon Mamatov, who says that he ran his own troll farm in the Ural Mountains from 2008 to 2013. During that time he employed from 20 to 40 people, mostly students and young mothers, to carry out online tasks for Kremlin contacts and local and regional authorities from Putin’s United Russia party. Mamatov says there are scores of operations like his around the country, working for government authorities at every level. Because the industry is secretive, with its funds funneled through a maze of innocuous-sounding contracts and shell businesses, it is difficult to estimate exactly how many people are at work trolling today. But Mamatov claims “there are thousands — I’m not sure about how many, but yes, really, thousands.” http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/07/magazine/the-agency.html?_r=2 PPPS Late last year, I came across a Russian manual called Information-Psychological War Operations: A Short Encyclopedia and Reference Guide (The 2011 edition, credited to Veprintsev et al, and published in Moscow by Hotline-Telecom, can be purchased online at the sale price of 348 roubles). The book is designed for “students, political technologists, state security services and civil servants” – a kind of user’s manual for junior information warriors. The deployment of information weapons, it suggests, “acts like an invisible radiation” upon its targets: “The population doesn’t even feel it is being acted upon. So the state doesn’t switch on its self-defence mechanisms.” If regular war is about actual guns and missiles, the encyclopedia continues, “information war is supple, you can never predict the angle or instruments of an attack”. http://www.theguardian.com/news/2015/apr/09/kremlin-hall-of-mirrors-military-information-psychology?CMP=share_btn_tw PPPPS Call it Terrorism: The Unacknowledged Tactic of the Russian-Led Insurgency in Ukraine’s East By John E. Herbst June 26, 2014 John E. Herbst is a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine and the director of the Dinu Patriciu Eurasia Center at the Atlantic Council. http://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/call-it-terrorism-the-unacknowledged-tactic-of-the-russian-led-insurgency-in-ukraine-s-east NATO loving trolls are morons And as if I, as an American, am some how obligated to to be the same dumb shit sort of Right Winger as you and people like Palin and Trump are….. Right You, who are such a marx-ssid, should go to Northern Corea and not stink in the US. NATO loving trolls are morons Why? It stinks the worst right here in the US with all the garbage created by capitalism here. Concrete all over the damn place, and cars going around in circles with millions of utterly vapid people farting out their hamburgers inside their own vehicles. We, the USA, is the leader in garbage production, including your own stupid vapid comment, Idiot. guest That’s why you have been told: Go to North Korea. No cars, no hamburgers. No, really, why are you still living in the US if you hate this country? NATO loving trolls are morons I don’t hate the country. I just despise people like you who live in it…. You Right Wing idiots disgrace the US! Nikita Voronin Identifying themselves as “american citizens” is actually a common theme for russian nazi-trolls. The idea is to have more appeal to the US or perhaps other western readers by placing themselves in the “our/us/we” category. And then they try to impress you with some uhmm… “critical thinking” by stating that NATO is evil, the US is only some racist entity and the Western world is run by war-mongers and extreme rightwingers. It’s a typical pattern, probably based on a trolling guidebook or sth. NATO loving trolls are morons You are a real genius! ‘Identifying themselves as “american citizens” is actually a common theme for russian nazi-trolls.’ And I guess that if you actually are an American being falsely accused of being Russian by morons like yourself, then we should respond that we live in Moscow //// You are a true moron, Dude. And you say your name is just what???? ‘Nikita Dumkoff”? Nikita Voronin It seems the article and some comments have really stirred you up. Try to relax! NATO loving trolls are morons Is that what you do, Nicky? You ‘relax’ and then fart out your shit onto the screen? citicrab It’s obvious you are a Russian professional troll. Your initial post had nothing to do with the subject of the article, was meant to divert attention from it and manufacture a faux controversy. It’s a well-known and – researched diversionary tactics. I am not trying to argue with you, as there is no subject – my post is meant for the naive responders to your provocations that help you muddy up the discussion of a well-researched article. NATO loving trolls are morons Whatever, Teach, you dumbass moron and….. ‘…my post is meant for the naive responders to your provocations that help you muddy up the discussion of a well-researched article.’ …pompous ass. Right The fact that you pass to personal insults shows that you lost the discussion. What can you say, really? A typical leftist attitude: if you have nothing to say, just yell out loudly. Marx-ssidic shit. Massif1 I believe you’re the guy from the troll factory that will be turning off the light. You have been writing solemnly on pro-Ukrainian articles and articles that target Russian disinformation campaigns. Go get a job selling Ladas or something. NATO loving trolls are morons DumbAss. I’ll keep on expressing my opinions from right here in the USA all I want, You Right Winger Morons simply don’t speak for everybody, and you never will either, Now go stick it up Trump’s you know where…. Massif1 Take your meds, guy. NATO loving trolls are morons Do you always like to jerk off with ad hominem crap, Moron? Istvan Great. Do that. Appreciate that. And be glad that you can do that freely without the fear of punishment Istvan Are you really saying this article is not legit purely because you are a US Citizen and a Putin supporter without being on Putin’s payroll? doroteo arango yawn… Anybody who says anything against US foreign policy these days now gets told stupidly that they are automatically “putin supporters’. Not only do we now have a new cold war but we have a new Joe McCarthy Era too! Istvan Pot, kettle. You call everyone right wing, Trump and Palin supporters for no reason. Massif1 If you love Russia so much Delta can fly you to Moscow. NATO loving trolls are morons Thanks, but I do not want a Right Winger nitwit like you to be any sort of travel guide for me. It really pisses you fugs up a lot that Russia is a sometimes independent of the US voice in the world today. Ionutz Yountz you tell ’em Reynaldo apparently you have much in common with the Zetas; siempre vacua NATO loving trolls are morons Sure, Urnutz, I like to cut off a head at least once a week, and you are a head that just fell into the mud, Moron. Ionutz Yountz Perhaps you require a dictionary, ESL students must have them. Obviously logic isnt your strong suit either maybe a primer on logical fallacies is in order. enjoy your flea circus. NATO loving trolls are morons Yawn…. I believe it is you that has spent a lot of time as a student in ESL, NuttyUzzzz. Joe Morton Turnabout is fair play. Here’s hoping all the NATO and Kiev trolls get their crap hacked by CyberBerkut and all the US/UK gov payoffs via Atlantic Council to this moron Eliot Higgins come out. As if there isn’t an army of moronic Kiev and NATO trolls who obsessively monitor the #Mh17 hash tag on Twitter 24/7 with names like RoarBro, ASpinoftheWheel and MJoyce (the tuba playing bastard who never sleeps and is probably some Pentagon psyops bot experiment). Any US, Polish or eurotrash Swedish and Italian Nazi mercs who fought for the criminals in Kiev deserve to be outed too. Joe Morton Global Voices is just another Soros operation anyway, like the CIA slush fund ‘Open Society Institute’. Dear Kiev trolls clogging this thread I’m an American and I for one, resent your failed state pathetic country dominated by idiots and Bandera worshipping Nazis sponging off my tax money. You had your Maidan and your stupid war on Donbass kids and babushkas but want ME to pay for it, well go scrub a toilet in Poland if they’ll let you in once Daddy Warbucks Soros and the SBU Nazi thugs don’t have a trolling job for you anymore. Dirk Smith You Putinist parrots need some new material. Geez, robotic morons…… odikhmantievich They could certainly do with some of your originality – simply calling everyone you disagree with a putinbot rather than responding to their argument.
