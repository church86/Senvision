This year the companies have two phones that are competing in the market for dominance. The Google has the Pixel (and Pixel XL) while Apple has the iPhone 7 (and the iPhone 7 Plus). The iPhone 7 was launched before the Pixel, and it is an evolution of Apple's iPhone 6S. It is also the stepping stone to Apple's iPhone 8, which is expected to be "revolutionary" and not evolutionary. The Pixel, meanwhile, is Google's "first" phone and one of the biggest aims that Google has with it is to beat the iPhone. Well, Google almost succeeds. The Google Pixel is a good phone. Nay, it's a great phone and in many core areas is better than the iPhone 7. And yet there are three reasons that hold it back from beating the mighty iPhone. Maybe next year the Pixel will raise the bar and get its act together to beat the iPhone. But then the iPhone 8 too will be in a different league. But this year in 2017, it falls somewhat short, all because of three reasons. Also read: iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus review: The best iPhones Apple has made No waterproof body: This is kind of a big deal in a premium phone nowadays. And although people may think that a waterproof body is not something of a must have feature, take a look at it this way: It's like seatbelts in the cars. You don't know you need them until one day they save your life. The same is true for a waterproof phone. You don't realise you need it until one day accidentally you drop your phone in a bucket full of water. Also, a waterproof phone provides such incredible peace of mind. You can use it with wet hands and be a little careless about it in ways that truly make using the phone relaxing. No stereo speakers: This again is a big missing feature in Google Pixel. In fact, its speakers aren't all that good for a premium phone. The iPhone 7 on the other hand has fairly sweet sounding (for a phone) stereo speakers. Even otherwise the audio performance on the iPhone 7 is better, even if you are using an earphone or headphone. And this is despite the hassle that the iPhone 7 poses because of its lack of the 3.5mm jack. Exemplary Apple support: This is the biggest reason nowadays to buy an iPhone. If you are getting the latest iPhone, in this case that is the iPhone 7 Plus, you end up with a phone that you can, if you are little careful in the way you use the phone, end up using for 3 to 4 years despite any hassles. The phone won't slow down. You will continue getting the latest iOS updates. And if something goes wrong with your phone, you will most probably get an aftersales service that is better than the rest. We have seen it again and again that Apple supports an iPhone for 4 years. The Pixel, meanwhile, will be supported for 2 years and while Google is promising top aftersales support for the Pixel phones, we will need to see the company walk the talk on this aspect before we can see whether it matches the Apple support or not. Now, this is not to say that the Pixel is a phone that you should not buy. Far from it. In fact, we have argued that for a lot of consumers the Pixel and the Pixel XL are the best phones in the market. These two phones have the best camera every seen in a phone  and in many core areas, including the software, they edge out the iPhone 7 Plus and the iPhone 7. But like everything else out there, these two phones are also not perfect.  Also read: Pixel XL and iPhone 7 Plus vs DSLR cam: You can't tell the difference For more news from India Today, follow us on Twitter @IndiaTodayTech and on Facebook at facebook.com/indiatodaytech For news and videos in Hindi, go to AajTak.in.ताज़ातरीन ख़बरों और वीडियो के लिए आजतक.इन पर आएं.   Most Read Slow Jio 4G speed: Here's a method to increase Jio speed but why bother WhatsApp now rolls out video calling feature, for now in beta Jio 4G may remain free until March 2017: Report 32 lakh ATM cards hacked: Is your debit card safe and should you change PIN?

Picture it in your mind — don’t overthink it. What are they wearing? What's their gender? The color of their skin? If you aren’t all that happy with what popped into your head, it’s understandable. Not to worry, this is a safe space. And you’re not alone. In 1983, David Chambers published his work on the Draw-a-Scientist Test, in which he simply asked a number of elementary school students to “draw a picture of a scientist.” Core stereotypes emerged from this test and the many similar studies that have followed throughout the years. For example, the presence of a white lab coat, facial hair, glasses, and chemistry equipment. Among these stereotypes are that a scientist is white and male. We draw what we see. Many of us are anchored in the images of the “real” and popular scientists at an early age, usually reinforced by history class. They’re the Old Boy’s Group of Discoverers: Edison, Newton, Tesla, Darwin, Einstein. These “Founding Fathers” — the ones that would be printed on Science Dollars if they existed (come to think of it, they do... they’re called grants) — command respect and adoration. They are the ones that “do” science. Go ahead, Google “famous scientists.” With whatever algorithm Google uses for the pre-selected banner, only two women make the cut for the first 30 spots, with no people of color present at all until George Washington Carver at #31. The Peanut Wizard deserves better than this. From those roots, our image of a scientist is affected by a variety of factors including our socioeconomic backgrounds, education, and personal connections. And then there’s popular culture. Growing up, we’re exposed to all varieties of media — movies, television, the Internet, books (please ignore “books” if you’re reading this 10 years into the future) — and this exposure can fundamentally shape how we perceive things. Indeed, this influence has been found to be true in relation to students’ perceptions of scientist. For example, a more recent study found that when drawing a scientist, 4th grade students that cited entertainment media as their primary source of inspiration were more likely to depict scientists unrealistically than those inspired by science communication media and school. (In this context, an unrealistic scientist mixes-potions-makes-explosions, while a realistic scientist puts asterisks above bar graphs.) However, this can go beyond just a perception. One longitudinal study exploring the effects of media on the self-esteem of black and white children discovered that television exposure “predicted a decrease in self-esteem for all children except white boys.” We call that difference in self-esteem White Male Privilege. Now, there are many factors at play here, but we can’t discount the role of representation. Importantly, even women and people of color were inclined to stereotype a typical scientist as white and male. According to a 2013 report by the U.S. Census Bureau, women, Hispanics, and African Americans are still significantly underrepresented in STEM fields compared to their representation in the overall workforce. It’s easier to imagine the stereotype when it truly mirrors the vast majority. For a more thorough academic analysis of this concept, watch Zootopia. Unsurprisingly, this also holds true in the entertainment industry. Just this year, the Comprehensive Annenburg Report on Entertainment found that across 414 film and television/streaming programs reviewed from 2014-2015, only 33.5% of females had speaking roles. Additionally, only 28.3% of non-white ethnic groups were speaking characters on these platforms, disproportional to the 37.9% of the population they make up. While the problem is clearly not endemic to just this industry, it’s easy to see how the images it presents exist for society to emulate. Underrepresentation in entertainment means underrepresentation in professions portrayed, which can then be internalized by the viewer. Nobody should think that a STEM job is “for white people” — outside of Nazi Physician. Representation alone is emphasized so much here because it appears that it will be the primary issue as we move into more progressive times. Between 1983 and 2001, negative stereotypes about scientists markedly eroded and scientists in general were depicted more positively by mass media. Other studies have found that women scientists are depicted in equivalent status to men in more recent portrayals. Essentially, the entertainment industry is making strides to portray scientists in general in a more positive light and run against gendered stereotypes. But exactly how much does it matter if the underrepresented groups have little presence? It’s encouraging that, say, a Latina scientist won’t be depicted as dependent and inferior to her male counterparts, but the main hurdle is having her show up at all. It’s a bit like pouring a bucket of sprinkles on a donut hole. You’re content that your hole is candied, but there’s a whole bakery out there that could have used those extra sprinkles. Studies suggest that portrayals of scientists in media do not buck this trend. One study that reviewed scientists in television programs viewed by middle-school children concludes, “Consistent with other studies, the typical scientist character in these programs was an unmarried Caucasian man who did not have children, held a high-status science position, and was likely to be portrayed as being intelligent.” Notably, intersectionality (the overlap of social identities) is also a rare occurrence: depictions of women scientists are overwhelmingly white. When we consider that women are underrepresented from the outset, this renders women scientists of color nearly invisible. African American men have had some better success in this regard with major roles in such films as The Invasion, The Hunger Games trilogy, Source Code, and the television series Westworld. What do all of these works have in common? Jeffrey Wright plays the African American scientist. The man just really loves playing a scientist. Or maybe studios are unwilling to seek out other employable Black actors for similar roles. The truth is somewhere in the donut. Interestingly, Asian Americans, which are actually overrepresented in STEM fields, are the least likely to show up in film/television. There are some bright spots, however, like Dr. Henry Wu from Jurassic Park/World fame, the geneticist that indirectly caused the horrific incidents of both films, and Helen Cho from Avengers: Age of Ultron, whose biggest contribution to the film occurred while under mind control. Progress! Good luck finding Hispanic scientists in U.S. television or film, unless Dora the Explorer’s School Science Fair Episode satisfies the need for you. Even if we pivot to educational materials, the story doesn’t change. A literature review of children’s trade books from 1991 to 2011 also turned up a similar result, finding that “the scientists depicted were mostly male and mostly White.” The writers of that paper put it best: “if children's trade books are truly ‘a child's first introduction to science’, then perhaps that introduction should strive to present the community of science as we would like it to be, rather than strictly how it is.” Optimism, not realism, should be at the forefront of thinking when considering the gender and/or ethnicity of a scientist in popular media. As scientists and professionals ourselves, it’s important that we foster open communication with the mass media and encourage greater representation among all groups. While this article solely covers the media component, it’s actually more important that children are exposed to scientists from all walks of life. Many of these same studies also conclude that children that have personal connections and experiences with real scientists, especially ones from diverse backgrounds, are less likely to hold unrealistic, stereotypical images of scientists. If you are from an underrepresented group, volunteer in your community and show the next generation that science is not a white man’s job. In the words of Melania Trump, they need “to know that the only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work for them.” White men have nothing to lose from these efforts, but the underrepresented have everything to gain. Whether it’s the valiant savior discovering the cure for the zombie outbreak or the background fodder of the research facility that gets eaten by zombies, it’s always important to ask the question, “Does this person have to be a white man?” Because there’s a child on the other end of the screen of that age-inappropriate program that may be thinking, “I, too, can live a successful and productive life making grand advancements in the STEM field before my brains are clawed out,” if they only saw someone like them.   Aaron Mattingly is a 4th year PhD student in the Biomedical Sciences program studying the roles of ErbB3 in organ development.

Not only are you hammered with hyperbole from all directions, with each company insisting its product is Elvis, Jesus and Chuck Norris rolled into one, but there are almost as many different software/platform combos as there are phones. Let New Atlas help, as we line up our picks for the 10 best high-end smartphones of 2016 – to compare their features, specs and harder-to-define intangibles. For this late 2016 edition of our Smartphone Comparison Guide, we're looking at 10 handsets: Google Pixel XL Google Pixel Apple iPhone 7 Plus Apple iPhone 7 LG V20 Samsung Galaxy S7 edge Samsung Galaxy S7 HTC 10 OnePlus 3 Motorola Moto Z (aka Moto Z Droid) We left out some quality mid-ranged handsets, like the iPhone SE, Moto G4 and Moto Z Play; if you're looking to save a few bucks, they're all solid options. We also skipped some major flagships like the LG G5 (its modular design fell short, and was eclipsed by its more-recent successor, the V20) and the Moto Z's sibling, the Moto Z Force (thicker, heavier and more expensive than the capable standard model). Size The LG V20 is the biggest phone in this bunch, but the iPhone 7 Plus (which has a smaller screen) isn't far behind. The iPhone 7 is smallest, but the Galaxy S7 is only a slightly bigger phone with a significantly bigger screen. At some point razor-thin phones went out of style, as phone-makers tried to find a better balance of thickness, battery life and screen resolution. The only handset in this bunch pushing that boundary is the super-svelte Moto Z, though you may prefer to use it with one of its modular add-ons, which will make it beefier. Weight The Moto Z is also ludicrously light, tipping the scales lighter than the much smaller iPhone 7. Build Aluminum makes an appearance on all 10 phones, though Samsung only uses its metal frames to bind glass fronts and backs. Colors Each phone gives you some degree of choice in colors. The asterisk next to the jet black iPhone 7 and 7 Plus? That's because Apple snuck in an upsale technique (a trick growing more common under Tim Cook's Apple), only offering that none-more-black option in the more expensive 128 GB and 256 GB models. Display size The iPhone 7 is the only handset in this bunch that drops below the 5-inch display threshold. You could say that makes it a little better for folks who don't want a huge handset, but keep in mind the Galaxy S7 gives you an 18 percent bigger screen in only a slightly bigger phone. The 5.7-inch LG V20 has the largest screen in this rogue's gallery, giving you 7 percent more area than the five 5.5-inch phones. Display resolution The iPhone 7 is also the only phone in this bunch to fall short of 400 pixels-per-inch, but Apple paid enough attention to details that won't show up on spec sheets – color range, brightness, contrast, richness – to keep its screen looking close to top-notch. Display type The AMOLED vs. IPS breakdown comes out 6-4 in favor of AMOLED. Pressure-sensitive display Apple is still the only major smartphone-maker bothering with pressure-sensitive displays, with its 3D Touch tech. It's essentially the mobile right-click, bringing up various shortcuts and previews by pressing harder on the screen. Second Screen LG is one of those delightful Android-phone-makers that's always throwing wacky new stuff against the wall. Following last year's V10, the updated V20 has a small strip of screen sitting above the main display that shows various shortcuts and alerts without trespassing on your main screen's turf. Curved display After the fiery Note 7 was recalled and discontinued, that left the Galaxy S7 edge as Samsung's only current-gen phone with a curved-edge display. It's mostly a cosmetic addition, though it can also do many of the same things as LG's Second Screen, only vertically (with the major difference that, in Samsung's case, that strip steals space from the main display). Camera megapixels Megapixel counts, once past a certain threshold (which all of these are) don't mean much. But we can say anecdotally that our tests showed the Google Pixel and Pixel XL providing the best photography of the year. The LG V20, iPhones and Galaxies all came somewhat close. Camera aperture (rear) The logic goes that wider aperture means better low-lit photography – and if you're looking only at physical sensors, then that's probably going to hold true. But Google's HDR software algorithms give the Pixel phones the best low-lit smartphone shots we've ever seen, despite having a mere ƒ/2.0 aperture. Dual-lens camera (rear) The iPhone 7 Plus and LG V20 both have dual rear cameras, but they each serve different purposes. The iPhone's second lens is a telephoto/zoom one, letting you jump between standard and 2x shots with the push of a button. The two cameras also combine to enable a new Portrait Mode that simulates (with hit-or-miss quality) the bokeh/blurred-background effect of a DSLR or mirrorless camera. LG's second sensor shoots wider landscapes instead, and lacks any kind of faux-bokeh effect. OIS The Pixel phones stand as evidence that great camera software can transcend camera spec sheets. Not only do they have the smallest apertures in this bunch, they also lack Optical Image Stabilization. Yet they have not only the best low-lit photography, but also the most stable and least-blurred shots of moving subjects that we've seen in a phone. Battery (capacity) The Galaxy S7 edge has the biggest (highest-capacity) battery in this bunch, but many other factors play into real-world battery life (keep reading). Battery benchmark (lower is better) In our own battery benchmark, where we stream video over Wi-Fi with screen brightness measured at a consistent luminance, the Samsung phones and OnePlus 3 had the best scores – dropping just 9 percent per hour. While the larger Google Pixel XL fared pretty well, the smaller Pixel lost a disappointing 14 percent per hour. Fast charging Over two years after fast-charging tech started popping up in Android flagships (and has improved incrementally since), Apple has yet to offer its own version of this handy feature. Removable battery The LG V20 harkens back to older Android flagships, with its removable battery. If you pick up a spare, you can skip the bulky battery cases or clunky portable chargers, and simply swap that out during an unusually long day. Wireless charging Only Samsung built wireless charging into its phones, but you can buy a battery mod (read on) for the Moto Z that adds the same functionality. Some models of the LG V20 can add wireless charging, if you buy a replacement backing that supports it. Processor You're getting a fast phone no matter which you pick, but in our experience, we found the iPhones and Pixels to provide the smoothest, most real-time feeling in day-to-day performance. RAM RAM isn't always a perfect predictor of real-life multitasking performance (the iPhone 7, for example, still fares very well there), but for those keeping score, the OnePlus 3 has the most. Storage For internal storage, most phones give you several different pricing tiers to choose from. LG and OnePlus are the most generous in their base tiers, with a spacious 64 GB. Expandable storage Only half the phones, though, let you expand/augment that internal storage by popping in a microSD card. These relatively cheap solutions can add up to 2 TB. The V20 has the best all-around storage setup, with 64 GB internal as standard and microSD support. Water resistance Samsung and Apple both added water resistance to their 2016 flagships, but the Galaxies have the higher rating (their IP68 means they can be immersed continuously, while the iPhones' IP67 allows for 1 m/3.3 ft of water for up to 30 minutes). The asterisked phones have some light water resistance (usually just splash protection), but not enough to warrant a full "yes." Hi-Fi audio If you're an audiophile, or at least have a high-quality pair of headphones (think more Sennheiser, Sony or Bose's latest, less Beats), then the LG V20 and HTC 10 can give you outstanding audio without needing to buy any extra DAC accessories. The V20 gets the edge here, though, with its "Quad DAC" for headphone use (the HTC 10 has a standard built-in DAC too) and AptX HD support for wireless listening (the HTC 10 supports last-gen AptX, not the newer HD variant). With Hi-Fi audio files (or Hi-Fi streaming from Tidal) and the right pair of cans, both phones will produce much better sound than anything else in this group. Apple likes to brand itself as a company that "loves music," but it's less concerned than LG or HTC with making that music sound as good as possible. Headphone jack Apple made headlines when it killed the headphone jack in the 2016 iPhones, but Lenovo beat Tim Cook and Co. to the punch by a couple of months with the Moto Z. VR For nearly two years (if you count the Innovator Edition dev kits), Samsung phones were the only place to get high-quality virtual reality on your phone. That's set to change with the coming arrival of Google Daydream, which, at launch, will only work with one headset (Daydream View) and two handsets (the Pixels). Samsung's and Oculus' Gear VR, though, still has the best selection of mobile VR content by a wide margin. Daydream's library will likely take some time to catch up. Daydream View has one potential advantage in the inclusion of a single motion controller: a far cry from motion controls on higher-end VR setups, but still something the Gear VR doesn't yet have or support. Virtual assistant The Pixel phones mark the debut of Google Assistant, a more evolved version of the old Google Now, which runs on all the other Android phones. The tech giant wants Assistant to serve as a more worthy foe to Apple's Siri, and our testing shows that it more than holds its own. Fingerprint sensor In 2016, the question is no longer whether a flagship phone has a fingerprint sensor, but whether it's on the phone's frontside (in the home button slot below the screen) or backside (just below the camera). Modular build Lenovo swung for the fence with the modular Moto Z, which snaps various "Mods" into place using built-in magnets. Most of them are gimmicky (things like a speaker or projector), but the battery mod is the most elegant solution we've seen to adding battery life to a phone. Well, except, perhaps, for the LG V20's removable battery. Stylus With the Note 7 disappearing in a cloud of smoke (in some cases, literally), we're left without any major flagships with integrated stylus support. Software Every phone here that isn't an iPhone runs some version of Android, but not all are created equal. The Google Pixel's OS is the best of the Android bunch, with a pure version of the new Android Nougat that's intertwined with the hardware to a degree that you don't typically see on Android. OnePlus and Motorola come close to using stock Android, with no egregious UI changes, but their flagships are currently stuck on Google's 2015 OS release, Marshmallow. Samsung, LG and (to a lesser degree) HTC add their own UI customizations and marketing-focused features to the Android base. For more on iOS 10, running on the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, you can check out our full review. Release The oldest phones in this group are the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge, which means they're likely to be replaced by successors the soonest, with HTC not far behind. Starting price (full retail) You may have noticed that the OnePlus 3, while holding its own throughout this comparison, didn't have any standout categories. Well, here it is: You can order the phone for a mere US$399 full retail, nearly half of what you'd pay for its best rivals. The rest of the phones have more traditional (you could say "iPhone-like") premium pricing. The V20 gets an asterisk, though, since its full-retail price varies wildly, from $672 (Verizon) all the way up to $830 (AT&T). We'll pick a Best Smartphone of the Year before long, but in the meantime you can dig deeper on our picks with our full reviews: Google Pixel XL review Google Pixel review iPhone 7 Plus review iPhone 7 review LG V20 review Galaxy S7 and S7 edge review HTC 10 review OnePlus 3 review Moto Z review If you're looking for other fun tech gear for the holidays, don't forget our Smartwatch and VR Comparison articles.

The Play Store now shows the install size of an application on the overflow menu – but only for some users. I can see this being useful when browsing games (or other large applications), as you don’t have to wait for the “Device full” notification to know if the app is too big.

The response addresses a supplementary statement of objections the European Commission sent to Google this summer. The commission's original statement of objections narrowly defined online shopping services to exclude services like Amazon, and it failed to take into account the broader dynamics of online shopping, which is "robustly competitive," according to Google General Counsel Kent Walker. The revision "didn't offer a new theory, but argued that, because sites like Amazon sometimes pay price comparison aggregator sites for referred traffic, they can't also be considered rivals," he wrote in Google's response. However, Amazon "gets only a tiny fraction of its traffic from these services," Walker pointed out. Google's Objections Consumers use various means to locate merchant sites, including general search engines, specialist search services, merchant platforms, social media sites and online ads, Walker wrote. They also use dedicated apps from merchants, which in Europe is the most common way consumers shop online, he noted. The EC thinks online shoppers look for products on a search engine, click on a price comparison site, then visit merchant sites, Walker suggested, but recent surveys in Germany and the United States show that many online shoppers in both countries go first to Amazon. Further, Amazon lets consumers compare product features and prices, and buy products for next-day delivery, "which makes [it] an even stronger competitor," he pointed out. There's no meaningful correlation between the evolution of Google's search services and the performance of price comparison sites, Walker maintained, noting that over the past decade a "rapidly increasing amount" of traffic flowed from Google's search pages to Amazon, eBay and other popular sites. The commission's revised statement of objections suggests that Google refrain from using specialized algorithms to highlight the most relevant ads for users, and instead highlight ads from price comparison sites, but "forcing us to direct more clicks to price comparison aggregators would just subsidize sites that have become less useful for consumers," Walker argued. Deconstructing Google's Position Google's arguments essentially split into two areas, said Mark Skilton, a professor of practice in the Warwick Business School at The University of Warwick. One is how tactical digital businesses like price comparison sites are distinct for their services; the other is Google's role as an intermediary for traffic to other sites. "My view is, they're missing one big point about market size and dominance versus consumer choice of services," Skilton told the E-Commerce Times. "Google is not a public utility or a self-appointed one, and this problem is exacerbated by its own algorithms in search as they walk a fine line between service arbiter and service delivery." Even the statistical arguments about traffic volume "are not relevant, as what's at stake is a separation of utility services and next-generation Internet of Things and 5G-type super services and super-data highways for smart cities and smart transport," Skilton noted. "Google is well placed for that next expansion and the EU is on the back foot here," Skilton argued. "Splitting up Google is self destructive, and the EU has failed in its single digital market idea that, ironically, is to Google's advantage." Putting the Squeeze on Google "The point of this exercise is to extort money out of Google and fend off competition with home-grown equivalents," said Michael Jude, a program manager at Stratecast/Frost & Sullivan. Google "can't win this on the merits," he told the E-Commerce Times. The EU's assertion that Google has a special position that it uses to depress competitive offerings "is close to the truth," said Jude, "but not the complete truth." Richard Adhikari has written about high-tech for leading industry publications since the 1990s and wonders where it's all leading to. Will implanted RFID chips in humans be the Mark of the Beast?

It'll launch on both Android and desktop later this year.More Virtual reality may live strictly within smartphone apps and PC software for now, but that won’t be the case for much longer. On Monday, at the W3C’s Workshop on Web & Virtual Reality in San Jose, California, Google announced plans to ship a version of its Chrome internet browser with support for WebVR, a technology that facilitates the delivery of VR apps and games directly from websites. WebVR is the product of the World Wide Web Consortium, the governing internet body that proposes web standards for implementation in browsers, sites, and other web incarnations. It  leverages WebGL, an API used to render 3D content inside of web browsers, and its latest iteration, version 1.1, comprises guidelines and best practices for web VR content formulated by Mozilla, Google, and others. The eventual goal: VR games and apps that can be streamed directly from the internet to mobile, stand-alone, and PC-tethered VR hardware such as the HTC Vive and Oculus Rift. More: Exclusive: Google will take VR to the streets with Daydream pop-up shop in NYC Sketchfab perhaps comes the closest to realizing WebVR’s vision. The latest release of the web-based 3D modeling tool allows you to view scenes inside a VR headset, provided you’re using a supported web browser and headset. Megan Lindsay, Google’s WebVR product manager, said that the Mountain View, California, company hoped to release a public version of Chrome on Android with support for WebVR 1.1 in January. It will be preceded by a beta in December. Signs of integration have already begun appearing. Chromium evangelist François Beaufort spotted settings in the beta and developer versions of Chrome for Android related to WebVR, accessible by typing “chrome://flags/#enable-vr-shell” in the browser’s URL bar. More: Google wants VR to work far better on Android phones with “Daydream” Desktop support will take a bit longer. Google expects Chrome for PC and Mac hardware to gain limited WebVR support in early 2017, with a full rollout to follow later in the year. Google’s initially targeting Daydream, its VR platform for smartphones. It takes the form of unified solution for headsets and smartphones: Daydream devices ship with a motion-sensing remote control, a home screen and navigational overlay, and a highly optimized framework. It’s supported on Google’s Pixel phones and select handsets from third-party manufacturers like ZTE (the Axon 7) and Asus (the Zenfone 3 Delux), and headsets including Google’s View, Zeiss’s VR One Plus, and ZTE’s VR. In related news, Lidsay said that development of a Chrome “VR Shell,” an interface that will let 2D websites not programmed for WebVR to viewed in VR, was underway. If all goes according to plan, it will launch in the first half of next year on Chrome for Android. More: Google Chrome’s “VR Shell” would let you view any website in virtual reality Chrome won’t be the first web browser to support WebVR.

Amy Gesenhues on November 7, 2016 at 12:30 pm More In addition to posting an Election Day reminder doodle and offering up an interactive tool that helps voters find polling locations, Google will be delivering real-time election results directly in search after the polls close tomorrow. “Starting when the polls close on Election Day, you will be able to find US election results integrated right into your Google searches in over 30 languages around the world,” writes Google Search VP of Engineering Shashi Thakur, in a blog post shared on the Official Google Blog, Google’s Politics and Elections Blog and the official YouTube Blog. Google says searchers will be able to find results for the presidential, senatorial, congressional and gubernatorial races, along with results for state-level referendums and ballot propositions. (While Google did not name a specific query that would surface results, the animated GIF included “election results” as the search term.) According to the blog post, YouTube will also be airing live election coverage starting at 7:00 p.m. ET on Election Day: Tune in to live coverage from NBC, PBS, MTV, Bloomberg, Telemundo and The Young Turks to keep up with all of the action as it happens. Complex News will also be delivering live coverage during a special election event from YouTube Space NY. Google reports a 233-percent increase in “how to vote” queries this year compared to the 2012 election year. It also says that since the presidential debates, users have spent over 20 million hours watching and rewatching the debates on YouTube.

Follow TechnoBuffalo We already knew Google Home would use similar technology to the Chromecast. Now, we have confirmation the two are almost identical—at least internally. In a new teardown from iFixit, it’s revealed the Home’s processor, flash memory and RAM and the exact same chips found in the second-generation Chromecast. The only real difference is Google added an audio amplifier, which was needed since Home is a smart speaker. Aside from that, there’s not much to Google Home. The good news is Google Home got a good repairability score, as many of the components are modular and can be replaced individually. However, iFixit says a few of the pieces are hard to take apart, so inexperienced tinkerers might find it hard to repair. Is Google Home worth it? In our review of Google Home, we found the smart speaker to be a worthy competitor to the Amazon Echo. However, it’s still unable to perform basic functions, which means it has a long road ahead before it’s the best smart speaker on the market. The fact that it’s only $129 as opposed to the Echo’s asking price of $179 is a good start. Now, it just needs a few tweaks and Google Home will be everything Echo is and more.

The new series represents the NFL's first VR production, following a series of experiments last season. It is being acquired using Google' s Jump 360-degree camera system. The series is set to debut on the NFL channel on YouTube on Thursday, November 24 — Thanksgiving Day. Later in the year, episodes will also be available on an NFL VR app for Google's Daydream mobile VR hardware for the Google Pixel and Pixel XL, which launches for $79 this Thursday, the NFL said. The deal makes sense for Google — exclusive NFL content is exactly the shot in the arm it needs as it launches its new headsets in a market that's getting more crowded all the time. "Virtual reality … is an exciting new medium to explore as we look to evolve and grow our offerings," said NFL SVP of Digital Media Vishal Shah in a prepared statement. "This partnership with Google is an important step in that direction." The first episode will cover the Philadelphia Eagles defensive line, including game-day footage gathered on the Eagles bench and sideline. Future episodes will cover the Miami Dolphins cheerleaders, Green Bay, WI, football culture and the San Diego Chargers, the NFL said.  The NFL said clips on its official YouTube channel, launched last year, have earned over a billion views.

Oct. 30, 2016 10:19 p.m. ET 1 COMMENTS How do big ideas get turned into reality? X is the “moonshot factory” for Google parent Alphabet Inc.—a place to work on projects, like autonomous vehicles, that have the potential to radically reshape the world. To get insights into how the operation works, and why it celebrates failure, The Wall Street Journal’s Rebecca Blumenstein spoke with Astro Teller, captain of the factory. Here are edited excerpts of their conversation. Picking and choosing MS. BLUMENSTEIN: How do you decide which projects to tackle? MR. TELLER: There has to be some huge problem with the world that we can name and say that we’re excited about going to tackle. Then there has to be a radical proposed solution for solving that problem. And there has to be some specific set of technologies which look really hard, that if we could get working, would enable that radical proposed solution.

IBM’s Big Bet on Artificial Intelligence The Case for the AT&T-Time Warner Deal Will Kobe Bryant Score Again? MS. BLUMENSTEIN: You take a certain amount of excitement in killing projects. MR. TELLER: All things being equal, I would rather that a project succeed than go away. I would reframe the statement this way. If your project isn’t going to make it, if it has an Achilles' heel, do we want to find out about that now, or should we spend tens of millions of dollars and find out about that two or three years from now? Astro Teller talks about the most difficult parts of building a roady-ready driverless car. MS. BLUMENSTEIN: There is a lot of impatience in the market for Google’s car. MR. TELLER: Getting a car to not drive off the road on a highway is not hard. Working better than a human in all of the situations that a human does that is four or five orders of magnitude harder. We’ve done 2 million miles of driving. To not drift out of your lane, good. But when someone walks out into the road holding a stop sign in their hand, you have to stop. If our car can’t do that and 10,000 other things like that, then we, nor is any company, ready to be on the road. MS. BLUMENSTEIN: You’re in the process of graduating the car. What does that mean? MR. TELLER: We separated their finances from X’s finances on January 1st. They have a lot of corporate legal stuff to do before they’re fully graduated. When Verily, our life-sciences business, graduated last year, it took them an entire year to check all these different boxes. Even once they were mostly graduated, they were still relying on us for a lot of services. We’re going through that with the self-driving car group. I would say the same thing about the cars themselves. You don’t want us to all of a sudden have every car in the world be driving themselves. You want every step to be rational and clear and borderline boring, because that’s probably what’s safe. MS. BLUMENSTEIN: You’re launching balloons that deliver high-speed internet access to the developing world. MR. TELLER: There are about four billion people in the world who have poor or no internet access. What if you could make something like a supercheap satellite, but hang it under a balloon, launching it for a thousandth the cost of putting up a normal satellite? But the winds are very unforgiving in the stratosphere. You can’t put a big gas tank on it and a propeller. The wind is too strong, the balloons make too big a surface area, too big a sail, basically. What if instead of fighting winds we went up and down? It takes almost no energy to go up and down a few kilometers. What if we taught the balloons to get super smart at knowing which way the wind would be blowing and how fast at different altitudes? We had a balloon stay over Peru for about three months. And then come home, back to California. Astro Teller says that when developing a breakthrough, teams should focus on the most difficult parts of a problem before anything else. Glass half full MS. BLUMENSTEIN: Let’s talk about Google Glass, a product that many say wasn’t a commercial success. MR. TELLER: More of our professional and personal lives are mediated by technology. Figuring out a way for there not to be cognitive dissonance created by our physical lives and digital lives is very important. Google Glass took good steps in the right direction. We could’ve done a better job of signaling to the world and reminding ourselves that the thing we built was a learning prototype. It wasn’t a finished product.

In August researchers discovered Android malware that was distributed through the Google Adsense advertising network.The malware tried to steal internet banking data and was automatically saved as an Android executable (APK file) to the SD card of the Android device. “This behavior surprised us: typically, the browser warns users about downloading a potentially dangerous file, and offers them a choice of whether or not to save the file,” Kaspersky Lab researcher Nikita Buchka writes in a blog on the website of the Russian antivirus vendor. When informed, Google quickly blocked the malicious advertisements. The researchers then tried to figure out why Chrome allowed the download. They found that the cybercriminals behind the malware used a smart trick to save the APK file to the SD card. They simulated a click on a download link, that was hidden inside a malcious advertisement. When the click on the download link was simulated, the APK file was downloaded in several parts and each part was encrypted. By using this method, the cybercriminals bypassed the download notification that Chrome would normally show and that would ask the user whether he wanted to save the file. When the download was succesful, the malware still had to become active and to achieve that, the APK still had to be installed. To convince an user to install the APK, it tried to pretend being an update of a popular app. Google has now patched the issue. Users who don’t browse with Chrome on Android are not affected by the issue, they are asked whether they want to save the file or not.

RenewAmerica.com November 14, 2016 Click here to receive our twice-weekly Newsletter Home Forum Analysis Links Documents Activism About Contact   Cliff Kincaid November 7, 2016 "People power" versus manipulation of the masses By Cliff Kincaid On November 8, the election will come down to Donald J. Trump's "people power," a largely spontaneous uprising of the "silent majority," against Hillary Clinton's scientific manipulation of the electorate, using personal data to identify and provoke people to go to the polls. In this effort, Mrs. Clinton has the support of the giant company Google and the president of its parent company, Eric Schmidt. Experts say the effort resembles how the Communist Chinese dictatorship monitors people and modifies their behavior through media manipulation and censorship of the Web. As Trump suggests, the election process seems "rigged," and the evidence has come in the form of another John Podesta email. One of the internal Clinton campaign emails disclosed by WikiLeaks shows that Schmidt, chairman of the Google parent company, offered a detailed campaign plan for the Clinton campaign. The April 15, 2014, message, addressed to Clinton aide Cheryl Mills, said, "I have put together my thoughts on the campaign ideas and I have scheduled some meetings in the next few weeks for veterans of the campaign to tell me how to make these ideas better." The details included "Size, Structure and Timing" and a campaign budget of $1.5 billion, with more than "5000 paid employees and million(s) of volunteers." The Schmidt email was sent along to several key Clinton people, including campaign chairman John Podesta. The plan examines how information is received and reviewed by voters, and what provokes them. Indeed, in a section titled "The Voter," Schmidt says, "Key is the development of a single record for a voter that aggregates all that is known about them. In 2016 smart phones will be used to identify, meet, and update profiles on the voter." Schmidt goes on to say, "For each voter, a score is computed ranking probability of the right vote. Analytics can model demographics, social factors and many other attributes of the needed voters." Patrick Wood, editor of Technocracy News, comments that Schmidt's scoring idea "is just like China's social scoring of citizens to see who is for them and who is against them." On one level, this means that search engine results are manipulated. In his evaluation of the Schmidt email, Michael Cantrell comments, "For some time now, people have wondered if Google, the world's largest search engine, might be a tad bit slanted when it comes to politics, favoring left-wing candidates over conservatives in how search results are displayed. Well, it seems those suspicions may not be so far-fetched after all." Earlier this year, in a column carried by Accuracy in Media, Seton Motley documented how Google was designing its search engine to maneuver people away from the issue of Hillary Clinton's health problems. It's a fact of life that in this era of access to many different sources of information, some people go to the Google search engine and rely on the first item that pops up. That's how I got banned (temporarily) from the campus of the State University of New York at New Paltz. A feminist professor used Google to search my name and passed around derogatory information from the first source on the search engine page – the Southern Poverty Law Center. She then passed around the information, creating a stink that caused the campus administration to cancel the debate I was scheduled to participate in. A new book, Islamic Jihad, Cultural Marxism and the Transformation of the West, examines the role of Google as a new media "gatekeeper" that determines how people see the reality of the world. The author, William Mayer of PipeLineNews.org, examines how Google produces search engine results on the subject of Islamic terrorism that play down criminal activities of leading Jihadists. Mayer says the results can be confusing unless the search terms are assembled with scrupulous precision, "a difficult task when one isn't exactly sure in advance the extent of the associations being pursued." In his excellent book, Mayer documents in detail the "leftist/Obama/Media merger" that played a significant role in Obama's 2012 victory and figures prominently in Hillary Clinton's plan for victory on Tuesday. Mayer comments, "...if we think of the Internet as the largest depository of information ever to be created, it assumes in many sense the role of the book of common wisdom. When the universal storehouse of information obfuscates and hides knowledge it becomes censorious, preventing or at least stifling access to non-ideologically approved ideas and information." When Barack Obama campaigns against Trump by citing the KKK, you can rest assured this has been determined by analysts in the Hillary campaign to be at least somewhat effective in scaring blacks. Getting blacks to vote against Trump is a part of what they hope will be their winning strategy. Similarly, when Hillary Clinton campaigns with a profane rapper named Jay Z, the calculation has been made by some brain in the campaign structure that using such a spectacle will inspire other blacks to turn out for the former secretary of state on Election Day. Hillary hopes that the rapper's popularity will somehow rub off on her. These two campaign events are more evidence of how truly "scientific" the progressive movement has become. People are perceived by the Clinton campaign as subjects to be manipulated. Even with the use of these scientific techniques, victory is not assured for the "progressive" forces. That is why reports of vote fraud are mounting as Obama sounds the alarm about the KKK. For Trump to win, the "silent majority" will have to be a real majority with millions of votes to spare, surpassing the artificially created "progressive" bloc bolstered by fraudulent votes and created by an emerging technocratic dictatorship of access to information. The "media monopoly" that the left used to rail against is now controlled by them. © Cliff Kincaid   The views expressed by RenewAmerica columnists are their own and do not necessarily reflect the position of RenewAmerica or its affiliates.

Follow @ShiraOvide Facebook Twitter Email Print Share Nov 7, 2016 1:53 PM EST ALPHABET INC-CL A -18.53 At Closing, Nov 14th 753.22 USD SAMSUNG ELECTRONICS CO LTD -45000.00 At Closing, Nov 14th 1553000.00 KRW The Android operating system for smartphones is one of the most successful technologies ever created. Apple Inc. sparked the smartphone revolution, but Android spread it to the masses. The software backed by Google parent company Alphabet Inc. powers more than 85 percent of the roughly 1.5 billion new smartphones sold each year. Yet for all its success, Android looks increasingly in danger of falling apart.  Android World Smartphones powered by Google's Android technology are by far the most popular computing devices in the world Source: Bloomberg Intelligence and IDC Note: 2016 figure is an estimate published in September. That's because the companies that teamed up to make Android a hit -- principally Google and Samsung Electronics Co. -- are increasingly working at cross purposes. Google has just started to sell its first smartphone that competes with its ostensible partner Samsung, and for now it has kept for itself crucial voice-assistant technology that makes the Google phones more appealing than those of other Android manufacturers.  Now Samsung plans to use its own digital assistant for smartphones in competition with Google. Other makers of Android smartphone handsets, principally Chinese firms such as Xiaomi Corp., have also extricated themselves from parts of the Android system. Once successful Google hardware partners, including HTC Corp. and Lenovo Group Ltd., are struggling with their smartphone businesses and are no longer useful Android allies. Coalitions only hold together if all the partners are successful and share common interests. That's no longer a given with Android.  Market Share of Android Smartphones 87.6% Google started backing Android in the first place because it was worried Apple (and Microsoft, and the phone companies) could find ways to disadvantage or block Google's web search on smartphones. Android was Google's effort to build its own smartphone playground and ensure Google stayed relevant as more computing activities moved from PC web browsers to mobile gadgets. That strategy panned out. But controlling the operating system no longer gives Google a guarantee to siphon and harness all the world's digital information. The more time people spend using Facebook, Snapchat or Siri on their phones -- even on Android phones -- the more data is being generating out of Google's reach. Wresting back some of that power and consumer information is a significant motivation behind Google's efforts to create smartphones that it designs and controls from the chips to the apps. For their part, Samsung and other handset makers know they can no longer rely on Google for their mobile existence. Samsung agreed in October to buy Viv Labs, a startup working on a Siri-like voice technology. In China and India, local companies sell Android smartphones with local versions of app stores in place of Google Play. In some cases, it's possible to use Android smartphones without interacting much with Google. All these moves are signs of the fraying Android coalition. The coalition of the willing isn't willing anymore. It isn't unusual for cracks to emerge in tech alliances. Partners Microsoft, Intel and personal computer manufacturers haven't always been on the same page about the Windows operating system -- a business that mirrors Android in many ways. At times, PC hardware makers felt as if Microsoft was getting the better end of the deal. While Microsoft got rich on Windows software, PC hardware makers were left to fight over single-digit percentage profit margins at best from making and selling Windows computers. In the Android alliance, Google makes the lion's share of the profits, too.  King of Android Google's parent company generates far higher profits than Samsung, the most successful manufacturer of Android smartphones Source: Company disclosures In short, it's hard to stay friends for long in the technology industry, as Google is finding out.  The Windows coalition has held through the turmoil, though Windows never branched far beyond personal computers and computer servers to other devices. The PC is now a fringe of computing, and Windows isn't even the heart of Microsoft anymore. It's not clear how this all shakes out for Android and Google. In contrast to Windows, Android is moving far beyond the smartphone into powering thermostats, web streaming gadgets hooked up to televisions and virtual reality headsets. But if the coalition can't stay together, the big risk is Android turns out to be a crucial technology, but not an enduring one -- the laser disc player of computing.  This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners. Samsung has also developed its own smartphone operating system, Tizen, as an alternative to Android. But Tizen has never gone anywhere.  To contact the author of this story: Shira Ovide in New York at sovide@bloomberg.net To contact the editor responsible for this story: Daniel Niemi at dniemi1@bloomberg.net Flight Tracker Flight Tracker Of the four airlines Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway recently bought stakes in, analysts see the most upside at Southwest and Delta: Source: Bloomberg Taking Flight Berkshire Is Back on Board With Airlines Industrials Tara Lachapelle Deflated Deflated Shares in luxury makers Kate Spade and Michael Kors have fallen from their peaks, while other luxury goods companies struggle to sustain gains Source: Bloomberg Not Your Bag LVMH Doesn't Need What Michael Kors Is Selling Consumer Shelly Banjo A Year to Forget A Year to Forget ConocoPhillips' stock has lagged behind its larger rivals in 2016 Source: Bloomberg Twofer ConocoPhillips Was Right to Split Energy Liam Denning Amneal deal would be $8 billion Alternative Medicine Rummaging in the Medicine Cabinet Health Chris Hughes Pound's best month since 2009 The Surreal World Trump Is No Cure for Brexit's $82 Billion Gap Finance Lionel Laurent Siemens is paying $4.5 billion Mentor Merger Siemens's Expensive Tastes Industrials Chris Bryant Easy Listening Easy Listening Samsung's $8 billion cash purchase of Harman International is its largest to date Source: Bloomberg Note: Includes acquisitions and investments for Samsung Electronics Co.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Mail Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple Google’s redesigned Gmail app for iPhone is faster and better looking Jacob Siegal BGR NewsNovember 7, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share On Monday morning, Google rolled out a comprehensive redesign for the Gmail app on iOS. In a blog post regarding the update, Google explains that this is the "biggest overhaul of the app in nearly four years," when version 2.0 arrived. DON'T MISS: Apple just released iOS 10.2 beta 2 Although the Gmail app functions similarly to how it always has, Google refreshed the UI, made the transitions smoother and added several features that users have been requesting for months or even years. The most welcome change for many Gmail app users will be the ability to swipe to archive or delete message. This has become a standard feature in virtually every popular mobile mail app, but somehow, it hadn't made its way to Gmail. Google has also brought the embarrassment-saving Undo Send feature to the Gmail app, allowing users to quickly "unsend" an email when you spot a typo or realize you forget to include the attachment you were supposed to send. Finally, the Gmail app will now offer instant results and spelling suggestions from the search bar, so the next time you search the word "flighht," the app will know that you probably meant "flight" instead. I haven't personally used the Gmail app in years, but it's somewhat shocking that this feature is only being added now. Still, better late than never for those who prefer the official app. Along with the Gmail update, Google is also refreshing the Calendar app, bringing new month and week in landscape views as well as support for Spotlight Search. If you use Google's mobile apps on iOS, be sure to update today.

Follow TechnoBuffalo Google on Monday pushed out a major overhaul to its Gmail app for iOS, finally bringing feature parity to its Android counterpart. The most noticeable difference is the presence of Google’s Material Design, which helps create a “fresh new look” that includes better transitions and a faster experience overall. Finally, the app doesn’t feel like it’s simply a wrapper for the mobile website. Unfortunately, users still don’t get a universal inbox. However, the update does feature Undo Send and an improved search that Google claims will return instant results. Here’s the full changelog, according to Google: Undo Send: prevent embarrassing mistakes Search: find things faster with instant results and spelling suggestions Swipe to archive/delete: quickly clear out your inbox A better Gmail experience The lack of a universal inbox is probably a deal breaker for a lot of folks—it is for more—but if you only have one email account, Gmail is an excellent option. Google also said its Calendar app for iOS is getting a much-needed update as well, introducing month and week views, as well as Spotlight search support. You can get the Gmail and Calendar updates for iOS now. Source Google Topics #Google #Gmail #Google Calendar Brandon Russell Brandon Russell enjoys writing about technology and entertainment.

Samsung started preorders on Nov. 6 for its latest Gear S3 Frontier and Classic smartwatches, which will be generally available for purchase on Nov. 18. The Gear S3 smartwatches, which start at $350, include the Frontier watch in two versions—a WiFi and Bluetooth model, and a WiFi, Bluetooth and LTE model—as well as the Classic model, which is equipped only with WiFi and Bluetooth connectivity. The Frontier model has more rugged styling while the Classic version looks more like a traditional digital watch and has a sleeker look that's designed to appeal to business professionals. Huawei has launched its latest wearable device, the $130 Huawei Fit sports watch, which provides multi-sport fitness tracking, heart rate and sleep monitoring, automatic step counting and more on a circular always-on display. Huawei designed the Fit to bridge the gap between a full smartwatch and a dedicated fitness tracker. The Huawei Fit has an aluminum body that comes in two finishes, Moonlight Silver and Titanium Grey. Three wrist band colors will be available—black, which is available exclusively at Best Buy through early January—blue and orange. Following the exclusive Best Buy arrangement, the devices will also be sold through Amazon, Newegg and other retailers. The Fit features a 1.04-inch circular black and white touch-screen display, 256KB of memory, 16MB of on-board storage and an 80mAh rechargeable battery that lasts up to six days on a charge with normal use. Google's efforts to push broad adoption of Rich Communication Services for cross-operator messaging on mobile devices appear to be gaining traction. The company announced on Nov. 4 that it has launched RCS messaging for Sprint customers that are using Android phones. The new support will allow Android users to conduct group chats, send high-resolution photos, receive and read receipts, and generally do more with chat than they currently are able to with standard Short Message Service. Sprint subscribers will see RCS support in Messenger for Android becoming available in 2017. All new Android devices from Sprint will have the RCS-enabled version of Messenger enabled by default on their systems starting next year. In recent months Intel has been demonstrating how aerial drones can be used for entertainment purposes. The company set a world record earlier this year by putting 100 drones into the air simultaneously, all of which were controlled by a single pilot. But on Nov. 4, Intel unveiled a new drone designed specifically for light shows and announced that the company in October had set a new Guinness World Record by having 500 of the drones—called the Intel Shooting Star—in the air at the same time, again being controlled by a single pilot in a demonstration presented in Germany.       Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows IBM Aims Watson at Embodied Cognition Microsoft Advances 'Any Developer, Any App, Any Platform' Strategy Google Will Tag Frequent Violators of Its Site Safety Standards Intel Lights Up the Sky With New Shooting Star Drone Old School Polling Methods Hid Trump's Popularity With Voters 10 Reasons Not to Buy the Apple MacBo...

RSS ALL ARTICLES FEATURES ONLY   TRIVIA Search How-To Geek How to Set Up Google Home Google Home is a new entrant in the voice assistant device market, where the Amazon Echo has reigned as the unopposed victor for nearly two years. Here’s how to set up your Google Home device and begin issuing voice commands completely hands-free. What Is Google Home and Why Would I Want One? Google Home is essentially Google’s version of the Amazon Echo. It lets you do pretty much the same things that you can do with your Android’s voice assistant, but without pulling out your phone to use it. Instead, it’s a standalone device that sits on your desk, countertop, or side table and is always ready to go whenever you want to ask a question or issue a voice command. If you don’t already have an Amazon Echo but are wanting to see what all the fuss is about, getting the Google Home is an alternative you can look into, especially since it only costs $129, whereas the Echo is priced at $179. Granted, the Echo is probably a better option right now, as it supports more smarthome devices, but the Google Home has a few exclusive features of its own—like access to Google’s mass library of knowledge, or the ability to control your Chromecast (which Amazon can’t do). RELATED ARTICLES How to Set Up and Configure Your Amazon Echo The Amazon Echo Is What Makes Smarthome Worthwhile How to Set Up Your Google Home Setting Up the Google Home takes only just a few minutes, after which you’ll be off to the races. Once you plug in the device, it will automatically boot up and from there you’ll need to download the Google Home app to your phone, which is available for iOS and Android. Open up the app and tap on “Accept” at the bottom-right corner of the screen. The app will inform you that your Google Home was found. Hit “Continue” to begin the setup process. When the app connects to your Google Home, the device will play a test sound to confirm that it’s connected. Tap on “Play Test Sound” to begin that process. Tap on “I Heard the Sound” in the bottom-right corner if you heard the Google Home device emit a sound. If not, select “Try Again”. On the next screen, you’ll select which room your Google Home device is in. Simply tap on “Select a room” and choose a room. Once that’s done, hit “Continue” down at the bottom. Next, you’ll connect your Google Home to your Wi-Fi network. Tap on “Select a Wi-Fi network” and select yours from the list. Enter in the password for your Wi-Fi network and hit “Continue” at the bottom. Once it’s connected to your Wi-Fi, tap on “Sign In”. If you’re already logged in to other Google apps on your phone, your Google account should automatically pop up. Tap on “Continue as [your name]”. If not, you’ll need to sign into your Google account before continuing. On the next screen, you’ll be asked if Google Home can access your personal information, such as your calendar, notes, flight info, and so on. This allows Google Home to provide you with better results with certain voice commands (like asking what’s on your agenda for today). Keep in mind that anyone within speaking range can access this info. Select either “Allow” or “Skip” at the bottom. The next step is setting your location and giving Google permission to access it. The app will try to pinpoint your location, but if it’s off in any way, you can hit the pencil icon off to the right and enter in your location manually. Once you’re done, tap on “Set Location” down at the bottom. On the next screen, you can choose whether or not you want to get email notifications about the latest news and info about Google Home. Use the toggle switch on the right and then hit “Continue”. Next, you’ll select which music streaming provider you want to use with your Google Home. Obviously, Google Play Music and YouTube Music are options, but you can also link to Spotify or Pandora. Hit “Continue” when you’re done to move onto the next step. After that, you may get a message saying that your Google Home is still updating, so sit tight for a few moments and wait for it to finish. Once it’s done updating, it will need to reboot. Tap on “Reboot” in the bottom-right corner. Once it reboots, the app will say that setup as completed. Hit “Continue” to move onto the tutorial or select “Skip Tutorial”. The tutorial consists of nothing more than giving you a few voice commands you can use and shows you how to use them. Hit “Finish Tutorial” on the last screen to exit out of it. You’ll then be taken to the Google Home’s settings screen (where it might be a good idea to explore and see what you can customize). Tapping on the back arrow in the top-left corner will take you to the app’s “Devices” screen where your Google Home will appear in the list. At this point, your Google Home is ready to go and you can begin using it. Simply say “Ok Google” and Google Home will start listening. After that, the world is your oyster.

Home Industry Tech Android’s Dominant Alliance shows signs of Balkanization: Gadfly Android’s Dominant Alliance shows signs of Balkanization: Gadfly The Android operating system for smartphones is one of the most successful technologies ever created. Apple Inc. sparked the smartphone revolution, but Android spread it to the masses. By: Bloomberg | Published: November 8, 2016 2:16 AM The Android operating system for smartphones is one of the most successful technologies ever created. Apple Inc. sparked the smartphone revolution, but Android spread it to the masses. (Reuters) The Android operating system for smartphones is one of the most successful technologies ever created. Apple Inc. sparked the smartphone revolution, but Android spread it to the masses. The software backed by Google parent company Alphabet Inc. powers more than 85 percent of the roughly 1.5 billion new smartphones sold each year. Yet for all its success, Android looks increasingly in danger of falling apart. That’s because the companies that teamed up to make Android a hit — principally Google and Samsung Electronics Co. — are increasingly working at cross purposes. Google has just started to sell its first smartphone that competes with its ostensible partner Samsung, and for now it has kept for itself crucial voice-assistant technology that makes the Google phones more appealing than those of other Android manufacturers. Now Samsung plans to use its own digital assistant for smartphones in competition with Google. Other makers of Android smartphone handsets, principally Chinese firms such as Xiaomi Corp., have also extricated themselves from parts of the Android system. Once successful Google hardware partners, including HTC Corp. and Lenovo Group Ltd., are struggling with their smartphone businesses and are no longer useful Android allies. Coalitions only hold together if all the partners are successful and share common interests. That’s no longer a given with Android. Market Share of Android Smartphones 87.6 per cent Google started backing Android in the first place because it was worried Apple (and Microsoft, and the phone companies) could find ways to disadvantage or block Google’s web search on smartphones. Android was Google’s effort to build its own smartphone playground and ensure Google stayed relevant as more computing activities moved from PC web browsers to mobile gadgets. That strategy panned out. But controlling the operating system no longer gives Google a guarantee to siphon and harness all the world’s digital information. The more time people spend using Facebook, Snapchat or Siri on their phones — even on Android phones — the more data is being generating out of Google’s reach. Wresting back some of that power and consumer information is a significant motivation behind Google’s efforts to create smartphones that it designs and controls from the chips to the apps. For their part, Samsung and other handset makers know they can no longer rely on Google for their mobile existence. Samsung agreed in October to buy Viv Labs, a startup working on a Siri-like voice technology. In China and India, local companies sell Android smartphones with local versions of app stores in place of Google Play. In some cases, it’s possible to use Android smartphones without interacting much with Google. All these moves are signs of the fraying Android coalition. The coalition of the willing isn’t willing anymore. It isn’t unusual for cracks to emerge in tech alliances. Partners Microsoft, Intel and personal computer manufacturers haven’t always been on the same page about the Windows operating system — a business that mirrors Android in many ways. At times, PC hardware makers felt as if Microsoft was getting the better end of the deal. While Microsoft got rich on Windows software, PC hardware makers were left to fight over single-digit percentage profit margins at best from making and selling Windows computers. In the Android alliance, Google makes the lion’s share of the profits, too. In short, it’s hard to stay friends for long in the technology industry, as Google is finding out. The Windows coalition has held through the turmoil, though Windows never branched far beyond personal computers and computer servers to other devices. The PC is now a fringe of computing, and Windows isn’t even the heart of Microsoft anymore. It’s not clear how this all shakes out for Android and Google. In contrast to Windows, Android is moving far beyond the smartphone into powering thermostats, web streaming gadgets hooked up to televisions and virtual reality headsets. But if the coalition can’t stay together, the big risk is Android turns out to be a crucial technology, but not an enduring one — the laser disc player of computing.

(Google) Share Written by Mike Murphy Obsession Machines with Brains November 07, 2016 If Google could control every aspect of your life, would you let it? What if it did a really good job at it? Two years ago, Amazon released the Echo, a voice-controlled speaker that can play music, read you the news, control your internet-of-things devices with ease, and help you buy things from Amazon. Since then, it’s become a sort of sleeper hit in the US, with estimates suggesting Amazon has sold over 4 million units since its launch. It pretty much stood alone for a while as the only simple, useful device of its kind. But this past summer, Google announced that it would be unveiling a device called Home, which did pretty much everything the Echo could do, but in a smaller, cheaper package, and with the might of Google’s internet-trawling knowledge behind it. The Home went on sale online and in-store at big-box retailers over the weekend. Should Amazon be worried about the Home? Probably. Does anyone need a device like this? Maybe. Quartz spent the week with a Home in their living room, testing to see if it can stand up to the Echo, and figuring out whether it might be worth replacing an Echo, or if it’s useful enough to bring the Home into your home. What’s good It works well. The Home can pull in music from YouTube Music, Spotify, Pandora, Google Play Music, and Tunein, so pretty much whatever major music service you use, you can listen to it at your command. If you ask it a question, it will almost certainly be able give you an acceptable answer. It sounds good. I never found the sound quality on the Echo to be particularly terrible, but with its four speakers (compared to the Echo’s two), the sound on the Home is a little richer, and a little less tinny. Turn it up to full volume, and it definitely has the power to blow out a small apartment in Queens. It’s easy to control. Just say “OK Google,” and Home will be ready to respond. You can also turn the device’s volume up and down by asking it to “turn it up/down” or by using the touch interface on the slanted face of the device. It’s easy to set up. Google makes it very simple to set up the Home. You plug the device in, download the Home app (which is the same app that you use to control a Chromecast), connect to the device’s wireless network, and then connect it to your wireless network. In all, setup took me about three minutes. It can control your home. If you have smart devices in your home, Home can be the hub that controls them all for you. It can tie into devices made by Google (Nest and Chromecast), Philips, and Samsung SmartThings. You can also create rules on IFTTT, allowing Home to do multiple things at once. For example, you can set it up so that when you say it’s “party time,” your Philips Hue lightbulbs will change colors. But you shouldn’t do any of this, because smart homes are a bad idea. Home is also supposed to be able to control Chromecasts as well, meaning if you have one of Google’s streaming devices plugged into a TV and on the same wifi network, you should be able to ask Home to play a YouTube clip on your TV. I had a first-generation Chromecast set up on the same network as the Home, and the app told me that the Chromecast wasn’t supported by Home for this function, but then a few hours later I tried anyway, and it worked perfectly. You can have a conversation with it. Unlike many other voice assistants, Google’s Assistant can actually remember context, meaning if you ask for the weather today, and then follow up just saying, “What about tomorrow?” it will be able to infer from your previous question that you mean the weather in your area for tomorrow, rather than having to restate what you’re asking about. It works on a range of questions, too. You can ask it, “What’s the best Chinese restaurant in the area?” follow up with, “How about Mexican restaurants?” and then “Which one is the cheapest?” and it won’t lose its train of thought. It seems to know everything. You can ask Home random questions about nearly any person, place, or idea, and it generally seems to be able to find an answer. This is almost certainly because Home has Google’s vast catacombs of knowledge behind it, so anything you could put into a Google search bar should work with Home. This becomes pretty apparent for more esoteric questions, where Home seems to just read directly from Google Knowledge Graph answers in certain cases (more on that below). The Echo, on the other hand, often fails to understand questions about people or places. It listens on multiple devices. This is very smart: If you have multiple devices, like a Pixel and a Home, with Google Assistant within earshot, they will all start listening when you say “OK Google,” but only one device will respond. It’s not entirely clear how the devices decide who is going to answer, but I’m guessing the phones defer to Homes because they’re louder. The price. The Home costs $130, whereas an Echo costs $180 full-price. Amazon recently knocked the price down to $140, ostensibly because it’s “Alexa’s second birthday,” but presumably also because it’s feeling the pressure from Google’s device that does as much, if not more than its own, for less money. It’s customizable. Although neither the Echo or the Home are particularly good-looking devices—the Echo looks like the GM Tower in Detroit and the Home kind of looks like an essential oil diffuser—but at least the Home can be updated to match your, erm, home, a little better than the Echo. The Home’s fabric bottom cover comes in seven colors, which you’ll be able to purchase from Google soon. What’s not so good It’s a bit slow. The Home definitely seems to take a few more beats to answer questions and pull up songs than the Echo does, but in both cases, you’re asking a small cylinder to magically pull information for you from a distributed set of servers across the globe instantaneously, which they both do dutifully. So it’s not exactly a deal-breaker. It’s wordy. Home tends to pretty much understand most things you ask of it, and will generally get you an answer, eventually. If you ask it for the weather where you are, it’ll tell you “Right now in Astoria, New York 11102, it’s currently 73 and mostly cloudy. It’ll be partly cloudy today with a forecasted high of 73 and a low of 52.” Alexa offers a similar response, but doesn’t feel the need to tell me my state or ZIP code. In many other situations, Home will give me the answer I’m after, but cite the source before she starts rattling off its reply. It seems that Home will just recite, in a lot of cases, the answers that you’d get if you typed a question into a Google web search. For example, if you ask it how to get out a red wine stain, it’ll think for a second, and then say: “Okay, here’s some information I found on Real Simple,” and then recite the exact response found in Google’s Knowledge Graph. It’s not that this is necessarily wrong or bad, it’s just worth considering if the amount of information presented in a web-based answer should be the same amount offered by a spoken answer that you can’t pause or restart without asking the question again. Home can’t really do more than one thing at once. If you’re playing music on Home, and ask it a question, and then tell it to stop (because the answer is too wordy, perhaps?), it’ll stop talking, and stop playing your music. If you ask it to start playing again, it’ll start at the beginning. Which is a bit annoying. “OK Google” is a weird thing to say repeatedly. Not that there’s necessarily a phrase that can make it seem particularly normal to talk to a small cylinder in your living room, but “OK Google” sounds like something you’d say when you’re exasperated, or ready to start an argument. Amazon’s choice of the name Alexa as its wake-up word feels a bit more natural, even though its device can’t hold a conversation. I actively hate saying "Okay google" because it makes me so aware I am ~ interacting ~ with a ~ brand ~ — mat honan (@mat) November 1, 2016 It’s also annoying to have to keep repeating “OK Google” to get follow-up answers to questions—which is the case with any digital assistant you’re trying to talk to—it’d be like having a conversation with someone and saying their name every time you answered them. In all of Google’s advertising for the Home, you only hear people ask Home a single question at a time, because after that, it just starts getting weird to keep repeating that phrase. One account at a time. The vast majority of my calendar appointments are on my work email, and although the Google Home app showed both my work and personal accounts in the app, I couldn’t figure out to how get Home to tell me when my next work meeting was. It can’t contact people for you. Google Assistant on the Pixel can email and text people in your contacts for you, but Home cannot. It’d be super useful to be able to fire off a message while your hands are tied up by dictating to Home, but at least if your Pixel is in earshot, it should be able to pick up the Home’s slack. Sometimes you have to get creative with your questions. There are instances where you ask Home what seems like a basic question that it can’t find an answer to, but if you ask for the same information in a different way, it will come back with what you want. For example, asking, “Did the Jets win today?” gives you a confused response, whereas asking, “What is the score in the Jets game today?” will give you the answer you’re after. Then again, perhaps Home was just trying to shield me from reality. (Google) Should you get one? If you don’t have an Echo, and don’t mind Google’s tentacles digging deeper into your digital and physical lives, then the Home is a great purchase. It works well, sounds good, and can keep inquisitive minds sated. And when Home doesn’t know the answer to something, it reminds you that it’s “learning more every day.” That means that, theoretically, this could be the last smart-home hub you ever buy, as Google’s AI will improve over time, and be able to better understand and serve you with each software update. Already, the Home is more knowledgable, easier to use and sounds better than the Echo. That being said, it’s worth considering what the purpose of these sorts of devices are. Smart-home technology is still a nascent field, where technological mishaps can cause you to lose power, have no working lights, or freeze to death because your IoT thermostat switched off. Multiple companies are developing their own standards, and devices like the Home have to act as a middleman between technologies. Beyond that, there are few times when proclaiming something across a room is quicker or less awkward than just pulling out your phone to Google the answer—assuming you don’t live alone. And whether you’re talking about the Echo or the Home, both of these devices are really just insipid ways for two massive tech companies to bleed more money out of loyal customers—the Echo as an easier way to buy more products from Amazon, and the Home as a way to sell YouTube Red subscriptions, songs and films from Google Play Music—and build up their data sets on their users. But if you’re just after a voice-activated speaker that can also answer some questions for you, the Home is the way to go. Read full story home our picks popular latest obsessions search

If you don’t already know, here’s how you can vote and other key details to know going into the polls. Where is my polling place? Just use Google. There are tons of sites that can help you find your polling place. But Google is just easier. The search engine giant allows you to type in your exact address and then locates your polling place, reveals its operating hours and lets you know what you need to bring with you on Election Day. According to Google metrics, 233 percent more people in 2016 have googled “How to Vote” than in 2012. Don’t allow confusion on where to vote be the reason you do not head to the polls. There are other important races   As you know, this is not an election exclusively for who will be our next president. Your vote matters across the board. The Democrats are scrambling hard to retake their majority in the Senate (which they lost in 2014). Politico Magazine has a nice rundown of all the various things that could be determined in different states, including some historic firsts and other ballot initiatives. Let’s not leave any election to chance Some polls have the presidential race between Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and Republican nominee Donald Trump as “neck and neck” in certain battleground states. According to  the New York Times Upshot/Siena College Survey released Monday, the pair are tied at 44 percent in North Carolina. In Ohio, the Columbus Times-Dispatch shows the state at 48 percent for Clinton and 47 percent for Trump. A Quinnipiac University poll shows Clinton at 46 percent and Trump at 45 percent with likely voters in Florida. Nationally, Clinton seems to have the edge. She’s three points ahead in Bloomberg’s final poll. Washington Post-ABC News’ latest tracking poll data shows Clinton at 47 and Trump at 43. But, anything can happen. Do we remember the presidential race of 2000? The outcome came down to some 537 votes cast in Florida. 5-3-7. This election doesn’t appear to be as tightly contested — but who knows what can happen once Election Day is finally here? People have died for your right to cast a ballot Yes, the above statement seems dramatic and designed to guilt you into caring about our country’s future. But it’s not. It’s the reality of America. For African-Americans, the statement rings especially true. From the Fifteenth Amendment to the passing of the the Voting Rights Act of 1965, the fight to obtain and maintain our vote has been arduous and ongoing. Today, African-Americans are having to fight against new ways of voter suppression, with new voter ID laws and voter intimidation tactics. Remember those who died for your right by voting on Election Day. Ashantai Hathaway is a reporter at theGrio.

Skerminkel Android is simply becoming too big. It is a fantastic success and the fact that it is open source is probably the single greatest benefit to consumers. Unfortunately progress requires competition and a monopoly not very conducive to that. Andrew Fraser While there is little wrong with the facts presented in the article (except for using Siri on an android phone), I’m not convinced about the conclusions. Yes, Android is big and somewhat fragmented, but Android as such is not Google’s main business. Google is a service business, selling advertising primarily, and all products are designed to supplement that. The Pixel is not the first Google phone, there have been multiple generations of Nexus phones made by manufacturers like Motorola, Huawei, Asus, LG and, yes, even Samsung. And Google doesn’t even make the Pixel, it is manufactured by HTC. Arguing that, because Samsung is considering introducing a voice assistant, that the Android coalition is foundering is specious. Samsung has considered releasing devices without Android in the past using an OS called Tizen, but stopped that project because it couldn’t replace the huge number of services and applications available in the android stable. That hasn’t changed. While every handset manufacturer will try to differentiate their offering, that doesn’t mean that the Android alliance is dying. On the contrary, having multiple companies developing services on the core of Android is healthy for innovation. As Mark Twain may have said – the news of Android’s imminent demise are greatly exaggerated. André Schild Except for the sheer fact that Android doesn’t have just one, single “core” and is as fragmented as dark matter over the entire universe. There are thousands of versions running on even more devices, hence “somewhat fragmented” is quite the understatement 🙂 Andrew Fraser That’s true, but also a bit of a bogeyman argument. Yes there are multiple versions of Android in the wild but what of it? André Schild “Multiple”? Another big understatement 🙂 Fragmentation =-> losing control =-> negative impact on general product quality (security, UX, performance, version management, optimization, versatility etc etc.) Can’t make it any simpler than that 🙂 But that’s just my opinion… Kabelo Mpyatona I agree.

SiliconValley.com Twitter Facebook Google+ RSS   Social Web Mobile Cloud Gadgets Cleantech VC Data Games Policy Media   Google Search to provide federal, state election results By Ethan Baron / November 7, 2016 at 11:21 AM For what will no doubt be one of the most closely and anxiously watched elections in U.S. history, Google will integrate results into Search. Typing in “election results” will bring up state-by-state and national results — and updates — for president, the U.S. Senate, House and governors, plus state-level referendums and ballot propositions, according to Google. Data, sourced from the Associated Press, will become available via Search after polls close. Also of potential help to those bound for the ballot box are “where to vote” Google searches. Users can type in the address where they’re registered to vote, and Search will bring up their polling place, complete with a map. For people interested in live news coverage on Election Day, Google has increased the number of networks whose election results coverage will be live-streamed on YouTube. Starting at 4 p.m., YouTube will stream coverage from NBC, PBS, MTV, Bloomberg, Telemundo and The Young Turks.     Photo: U.S. presidential candidates Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton in an image composed of two photos.

MUST CREDIT: Washington Post photo by Sarah L. Voisin Sarah L. Voisin, The Washington Post .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... ..........WASHINGTON – Music artists are reacting with outrage at the dismissal of the head of the U.S. Copyright Office, calling the move an aggressive attack that is part of a larger effort to erode their creative rights and to bolster advocates of free content. “This is a major affront to copyright,” said songwriter and music publisher Dean Kay. “Google seems to be taking over the world – and politics … Their major position is to allow themselves to use copyright material without remuneration. If the Copyright Office head is towing the Google line, creators are going to get hurt.” The Copyright Office administers the complex set of rules governing copyright and advises Congress on policy and legal issues. It is a federal department within the Library of Congress. New Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden last month abruptly removed Maria Pallante from the position she held since 2011 and reassigned her to a role of “senior adviser.” In a letter to Pallante that was obtained by The Washington Post, Hayden listed Pallante’s new duties, including undertaking a review of the library’s retail operation. The job would require Pallante to file weekly reports to a deputy librarian, Hayden wrote; it would “not require any communications with Members of Congress.” Pallante was told to move out of her office, and people close to the situation in the library reported that she was locked out of her computer. Advertisement Continue reading Pallante resigned three days later. In a letter posted online, she requested the “reinstatement of access to my computer and email.” A library spokesman said she was not denied computer access. Singer Don Henley said Pallante’s ouster was “an enormous blow” to artists. “She was a champion of copyright and stood up for the creative community, which is one of the things that got her fired,” he said. Although personnel changes are not uncommon when a new leader comes in, many in the creative industries interpret Hayden’s move – made six weeks after she took office – as proof of her anti-copyright bias. They say Hayden’s library background aligns her with Google, which owns YouTube, the source of many claims of copyright infringement. “The librarian wants free content, and the copyright office is there to protect creators of content. They are diametrically opposed ideologies,” Henley said. Hayden, he added, “has a long track record of being an activist librarian who is anti-copyright and a librarian who worked at places funded by Google.” Hayden declined to be interviewed, although a spokesman referred to her April confirmation hearing, when she told a Senate committee that she would make sure the office functions “in a way that will protect the people it serves, and that is the creators of content.” Pallante did not return several messages and did not come to the door when a reporter knocked last week. Copyright regulations are more critical and more controversial than ever because of dramatic changes in technology. In one camp are tech and internet companies that seek exemptions to regulations in their efforts to spark innovation. On the other side are filmmakers, authors, musicians and television producers who want to limit free use and be paid for their creativity. Many of their representatives, including the Motion Picture Association of America, praised Pallante and advocated for a strong successor. “It is imperative that the next and future Registers have the expertise, support, resources, and independence to continue the Office’s essential and constitutionally-backed role of advancing the arts by rewarding creators for their work,” Joanna McIntosh, the MPAA’s executive vice president for global policy and external affairs, said in a statement. Pallante was considered an ally of the film, television, music and publishing industries, which contribute between $750 billion and $1 trillion in annual economic activity and employ more than 5 million people. Last year, she issued a report, “Copyright and the Music Marketplace,” that listed fair compensation to music creators as its first guiding principle. The report also opposed a change in music licensing supported by the Justice Department, noting that “Congress, not the DOJ,” has authority to change the system. She also advised Congress that a Federal Communications Commission proposal requiring cable providers to make their content accessible to third parties appeared to violate copyright regulations. Advertisement Continue reading Kay and Henley say technological changes are undercutting their livelihoods. “There’s a mind-set that the digital giants have fostered that everything on the Internet should be free,” Henley said. “When they say they want free and open access, that’s code for ‘We want free content.’ “ “You don’t make any money from recording music anymore,” he added. “The streaming services have wiped out that revenue stream.” A Google spokesman said the company had no contact with the Library of Congress or the administration about Pallante or the Copyright Office. Kay said he sees the losses personally and in his publishing business. “It’s all moving digital and streaming, and unless we can straighten things out and get copyright adhered to in terms of paying fairly, we’ll see great damage to all kind of creators,” he said. But advocates for broad digital access say that Pallante was too cozy with artists and that her focus on their rights came at the expenses of others, including the public. In a recent, sharply critical report that found systemic bias at the Copyright Office, Meredith Rose of the nonprofit group Public Knowledge concluded that the office had aligned itself with the entertainment industry and “regularly disregarded the concerns of … libraries, archives and the public at large.” Public Knowledge, which advocates for consumer rights, released the report in September, before Hayden was sworn in. “The Copyright Office advertises itself as a research entity, producing reports, but at the same time they very much act as a lobbying art for content producers,” Rose said. Advertisement Continue reading Julie Todaro, president of the American Library Association, dismissed the idea that Hayden’s library career makes her an automatic adversary to strong copyright enforcement. “People look at copyright as content providers versus users,” Todaro said. “Technology makes everybody both, so libraries represent and respect both. That’s why we buy $4 billion a year of copyrighted material. Libraries are not about making everything free.” Pallante’s removal is part of a larger reorganization at the Library of Congress that includes promotions of several key members of former librarian of Congress James H. Billington’s inner circle. Before retiring last year, Billington was sharply criticized by federal investigators who found widespread management failures with the library’s technology. At her Senate confirmation hearing, Hayden pledged to address those shortcomings, especially at the Copyright Office. Pallante publicly supported a congressional effort to overhaul the Copyright Office and to remove it from the Library of Congress, a position that probably contributed to her dismissal. But Hayden’s reassignment of a popular and well-respected leader could spark renewed interest in the effort to create an independent agency and thus undermine her attempt to control the office. Several lawmakers responded to Pallante’s departure with disappointment, and Sen. Orrin G. Hatch, R-Utah, said it “underscores the long-standing challenges” of housing the Copyright Office in the Library of Congress. “I look forward to exploring this relationship and considering possible legislative actions to ensure the viability of our copyright system,” Hatch said last month. That would be a silver lining to an otherwise disappointing development, Kay said. “If the person at the top of the Library of Congress is against copyright,” he said, “then being the manager of the Copyright Office is devastating.” copyright-office Share Tweet LinkedIn Email Print Subscribe More News Suggested Stories: Online pirates thrive on legitimate ad dollars – Jun 3, 2014 Stolen photos of stars find 'safe harbor' online – Sep 4, 2014 Appeals court sides with Google in anti-Muslim film case – May 18, 2015 Appeals court rules in favor of Google's online library – Oct 16, 2015 Advertisement Comments Subscribe to the Journal for only $12.

Gmail for iOS is finally on par with the Android version Engadget 11/7/2016 Nathan Ingraham © Provided by Engadget Google wants its services to be on as many devices as possible -- to meet that goal, the company has been putting out excellent versions of its apps on the iPhone for years now. That is, except for Gmail, arguably Google's best-known tool beyond search. The Gmail iOS app was essentially broken when it launched back in 2011. A big update in 2012 made things much better, but the app has only changed in fits and starts since then. Its design doesn't fit at all with Google's current standards and it can be very slow. It gets the job done, but there are absolutely better options for accessing Gmail on the iPhone, including Google's own Inbox app. Thankfully, Google has finally decided it's time to bring Gmail for iOS into the modern era. The new Gmail app for the iPhone and iPad rolling out today and it brings both design and functionality up to part with the Android app. Indeed, the app is basically indistinguishable with its Android counterpart now. The basic feature set is essentially unchanged -- you have access to all your Gmail labels and the excellent search feature. You can add multiple accounts, and the app reflects whatever Inbox style you've picked on the desktop (priority inbox, starred email first, the various tabs grouping social, promotional and update emails and so forth). Popular Searches Apple Inc AAPL ▼ 105.71 -2.72 -2.51% Microsoft Corp MSFT ▼ 58.12 -0.90 -1.52% Samsung Electronics Co Ltd SSNLF ▼ 1,250.00 -175.00 -12.28% Amazon.com Inc AMZN ▼ 719.07 -19.94 -2.70% All of this worked in the old Gmail app. It was just much uglier if we're being honest. Now, the bright colors and animations of Material Design are present, emails have a small avatar showing you the sender, the sidebar lets you switch accounts faster -- the whole thing looks better and is more efficiently designed. The old Gmail also didn't perform like a native app. It reminded me of the old days of app, where many of them were simply a UI wrapper around content being pulled from the web. That made it feel like you were waiting much longer for emails to load than was reasonable in this day and age. That's all changed now -- there's no doubt that Gmail is much faster than it used to be. And there are a few new features to the app. They're not new if you've used Gmail anywhere else, but they're finally in the iOS app. First of all, the super-handy "undo send" feature is now available, saving your butt if you fire off an email to the entire company instead of just one person. You can also swipe a message to automatically archive or delete it, depending on your preference. As I mentioned, the whole app is faster, but search in particular got an overhaul. Now, you'll see search results auto-populate as you type, so you don't have to finish a word or hit enter to find the email you're looking for. Overall, the app feels like a cross between the old, traditional Gmail app and Inbox, which already had these new features. But if you aren't a fan of Inbox's grouping and snoozing features and just want the basic, plain-vanilla Gmail, this app absolutely does the trick. Google is also bringing a smaller update to the Calendar app for the iPhone today as well (sadly, the update doesn't include iPad compatibility). There's not much here, but Google did add one pretty useful feature: Events, reminders and goals that from your Google Calendar are now integrated into the iPhone's spotlight search. So if you're looking to make Google Calendar your main option over the built-in iPhone option, things should be a little easier. Google also added support for non-Gregorian calendars like Lunar, Islamic and Hindu -- so if you want to see those dates alongside the standard options, that's there. And if you want to quickly see a full week's view, just rotate your phone to landscape mode. Both the updated Gmail and Calendar apps should be rolling out to the App Store today. If you've been longing for a first-party Gmail app that feels up-to-date in 2016, definitely download today's update. It's been a long time coming, and after a few years using Inbox I might be ready to make the standard Gmail my main email app again. Here's hoping Google keeps updating it in a timely fashion rather than letting languish for years again.

What does this mean for you? Power – and lots of it. According to Qualcomm, the Snapdragon 821 is roughly twice as efficient and capable than the Snapdragon 810. Something new from @OnePlus is on the way…and it’s powered by our #Snapdragon 821 processor. Stay tuned. pic.twitter.com/3jOyZFRQ5tNovember 7, 2016 Next to the Snapdragon 820 chipset that you’ll commonly found in flagship phones like the Samsung Galaxy S7, LG V20 (and even the OnePlus 3), you’ll see smaller, but nevertheless noticeable benefits to performance and battery efficiency. The new chipset could also bring with it support for virtual reality by way of Google Daydream, if it comes stocked with Android Nougat, that is. The list of devices that support the new mobile VR platform is small: just the Google Pixel and Pixel XL. If true, it could be a huge selling point for the next OnePlus device. The rest of the equation OnePlus CEO Carl Pei has teased that the upcoming device will feature the beloved AMOLED display, and also keep the headphone jack that was omitted from the likes of the iPhone 7 and Moto Z. If OnePlus can do all of this and keep the price down on its next device, it could give the Google Pixel, and every other flagship smartphone in late 2016 and early 2017 for that matter, a good run for their money.

Follow TechnoBuffalo Google announced this week that anyone with an Android smartphone can run Android Auto. That’s right, you no longer need a car with a special Android Auto infotainment system. It’s great news for people like me. I have a car and use Google Maps and Google Music all the time, but I’ve never coughed up the extra dough to get an Android Auto unit. All you need to do is install the Android Auto application on your Android phone. Then you’ll see the large and driver-friendly icons for maps, phone and music. You still need to manually tap the microphone to use voice commands, which means OK Google isn’t supported right now. You only need your phone to run Android Auto The standard home screen looks a bit like Google Now cards, with all of your information up front and center. “Android Auto automatically brings you useful information – like suggested destinations, upcoming appointments, and weather conditions – all organized into simple cards that appear just when they’re needed,” Google said. Google says you only need a phone running Android 5.0 or newer to get up and running. With travel coming up, I can’t wait to try this. Ball’s in your cart, Apple.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search In Gmail for iPhone update Google tackles screwups and speed Eric Abent - Nov 7, 2016 0 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Google has detailed new updates coming to Gmail and Google Calendar on iOS, and if you use either of those apps, you probably won’t want to miss them. Speaking about the Gmail update specifically, Google says this is the largest overhaul the iOS version has received in nearly four years. There’s good reason for that claim, too, as this update brings a whopper of a feature with it: Undo Send. Gmail users have had this feature for quite some time on desktop and Android, and now after an extended wait, it’s arriving on iOS. For the uninitiated, Undo Send functions precisely how you would think – the feature gives you a few seconds after hitting the send button to stop the email from actually going out. This, in turn, gives you an opportunity to fix any errors you may not have caught before sending it off. On top of Undo Send, Gmail users on iOS are also getting improved search through instant results and spelling suggestions. Finally, Google has implemented swipe controls in this update. These function similarly to their implementation on Android, allowing you to swipe on individual messages to archive or delete them. If you’re a Google Calendar user, you’ll now find that you have month view and week in landscape view at your disposal. Google Calendar now also plays nice with Spotlight Search, allowing you to find events and reminders without having to jump to the app first. Beyond those two new features, Google Calendar now also supports non-Gregorian alternate calendars on iOS, such as the Lunar or Hindi calendar. So, it would seem that Google has been putting in some work porting features over to iOS. Both of these updates are live now on the iOS App Store, so be sure to snag them if you haven’t already.

By Jason Cipriani | November 7, 2016 -- 18:26 GMT (10:26 PST) | Topic: Google Image: CNET Google on Monday announced a significant update to Android Auto, the company's service that makes using a phone while driving easier and safer. With Monday's update, Android Auto can now be used without the need for a compatible vehicle and display. The only requirement is that a user own an Android device that runs Android 5.0 or above. Once the updated is installed on your phone, you can launch the app and will see a similar -- albeit smaller -- layout to what Android Auto users with a compatible car see, only displayed on your phone instead of an in-dash display. Items like fonts are bigger, while access to apps like Gmail or Twitter are restricted, with the app displaying essential services when you are behind the wheel, such as phone calls, music controls, or Google Maps. Google Maps updated to highlight the action around you Google updated Maps for the desktop, Android, and iOS today with visual improvements that should aid in your navigation this summer. Read More CNET had access to an early preview of the Android Auto update, and it has plenty of screenshots available to give you an idea of what it looks like as well as some behind-the-scenes info detailing Google's approach to the app. Google first announced the update to Android Auto in May 2016 at its annual developer conference, Google I/O. Monday's release isn't a finished solution, with notable features like "OK Google" commands missing. However, Google promises support for voice interaction in the "coming weeks". For those with a vehicle that offers Bluetooth connection, you can set the app to automatically launch once your phone and car are connected. The biggest problem with efforts like Google's Android Auto or Apple's CarPlay is the fact using either service often requires users to buy a new car or replace the entire in-dash system with an aftermarket solution. With this update, Google has eliminated a major hurdle for Android users to become less distracted drivers. The update will slowly roll out over the next few days in every country (over 30 in total) where Android Auto is currently available. Download Android Auto from the Play Store.

Email Password Remember me Forgot password?     Log in with Facebook Log in with Twitter Log In news tech & science social media business entertainment life sports     You can now 'unsend' emails with Gmail for iOS Listen | Print By James Walker     Nov 7, 2016 in Technology Google has announced the most substantial update to its Gmail app for iOS in four years. The overhaul includes a freshened interface, faster search and an "undo send" button that lets you pull email back while it's still sending to the recipient. Undo Send has been available on the desktop version of Gmail for around a year. Google has been slow to bring it to iOS, instead concentrating on the web and Android versions of the app. Today's iOS update is the most significant one for several years, as Google acknowledged in its announcement. Sending emails now have an "Unsend" button that can be used to revoke messages that are just being dispatched. Once unsent, the email won't appear in the recipient's inbox as its transfer from the server will be cancelled. The feature is available for a limited time after a message is sent. It's designed to help people avoid accidentally sending half-finished emails, or spotting a typo moments after pressing Send. Unlike the desktop version of Gmail, you have just five seconds in which to "unsend" before the app will deliver your email. The web interface lets you set longer intervals of up to 30 seconds before a transfer becomes permanent. Google hasn't said whether this feature will be coming to iOS in a future update. Gmail for iOS also has noticeably faster search now. Google said the app delivers "instant results" and can work out spelling suggestions when you type things wrong. Search can sift through your email to find what you're looking for more quickly than scrolling through your inbox. Gmail update for iOS 07/11/2016 Google Alongside the new features, Google has revised Gmail's interface so it looks and feels more modern. Styling has been flattened and brightened, there's new animations and transitions have been improved. It's also possible to swipe emails to the left or right to archive and delete them respectively, a feature that's been present in iOS' own email client and Gmail for Android for years. "When you get the next Gmail iOS app update, you'll notice some exciting changes: the biggest overhaul of the app in nearly four years," said Google. "It's the Gmail you know and love, with a fresh new look, sleeker transitions and some highly-requested features. It's a lot faster too." It's not just Gmail that's getting an App Store update today. Google Calendar has also been revised with a few new features. Google has implemented some of the most popular user suggestions for the app, including the ability to display the month and week views in landscape mode. It provides a better overview of the calendar and makes the app more versatile. Gmail update for iOS 07/11/2016 Google The app now supports alternate calendars too, including Lunar, Islamic and Hindu events. These can be added to Google Calendar to show key dates alongside your main calendar. Finally, Google Calendar has been integrated into iOS' Spotlight Search, letting you find events, reminders and goals from within iOS' native search features. The new Gmail and Google Calendar apps are rolling out in the App Store now. Google said it is continuing to develop both products, two of the most popular productivity apps available for iOS. They now have closer feature parity to their Android and web counterparts, lowering the risk of iPhone users slipping towards Apple's first-party Mail and Calendar.

(REUTERS/Mike Segar) Donald Trump is ranking higher than Hillary Clinton in Google searches on the eve of the U.S. election, as voters hunt for information on the Republican presidential nominee. Data released by Google show Trump dominating search in 38 states early afternoon Monday, including the battleground states of Florida and Michigan.  Google data also show that immigration is the top Trump-related search topic, followed by abortion and race issues. “If you take a deeper look at the information, you’ll see that the top five related searches to Mr. Trump are immigration, race, abortion, ISIS, and the economy - all hot button issues throughout this campaign,” said social media expert and President of JRM Comm Jason Mollica, in an email to FoxNews.com. “When it comes to Mr. Trump, people still want to know more. It also means that potential voters want to read what he said in the last 24-48 hours.” SNAPPING A SELFIE WITH YOUR BALLOT COULD GET YOUR VOTE TOSSED OUT Mollica noted, however, that the search data from Google should not be seen as a surge of voting for Trump. “It does mean that people are actively gathering and reading information in the last hours before Election Day,” he added.

See Predictions Map → The hotly contested battle between Trump and Clinton is clearly generating huge interest in the U.S. electorate. Google has seen an incredible 233 percent increase in “how to vote” searches compared to the period before the 2012 presidential election. People are also actively searching for “where to vote”, particularly in battleground states. TRUMP, CLINTON, TIE IN GOOGLE DEBATE SEARCHES Additionally, Google has launched a new election Doodle that shows the letters holding signs with the word ‘vote’ in different languages. When users click on the Doodle and type in their address, Google generates information on their nearest polling station, along with voting requirements and ballot details. Twitter is also encouraging people to vote. The social media giant is promoting the #ElectionDay and #Election2016 hashtag and emoji, as well as providing information to voters via its @Gov Twitter Government account. Voters, for example, can direct message @Gov to find their polling place and ballot information. #ElectionDay is almost here! Remember: you cannot vote via text or Tweet.

Technology is being widely used to provide information for voters in the run-up to Tuesday’s election.

vator vatorX vatornews Register Log in Newsroom Innovation series Interviews Lessons learned Trends & news Google puts real-time election results directly into search Chord cutters will be able to live stream news from NBC, PBS and others on YouTube Technology trends and news by Steven Loeb November 7, 2016 | Comments Short URL: http://vator.tv/n/4817 If you're anything like me, then you're going to be glued to the television tomorrow noght, waiting for the election results to come in. It's going to be a stressful night, no matter what side of the aisle you're on. What about the chord-cutters, though? That ever growing group of people who have given up on cable in favor of watching everything online. Where will they get their results? You can't live stream the news on Hulu. Google and YouTube have got them covered, as it was announced on Monday that Google will be integrating election results into Google searches, and providing live streaming options on YouTube. The search results will be available in 30 different languages, and it won't be only the national or state-wide results, but Congressional and Gubernatorial too. Users can even look up state-level referenda and ballot proposition results. That's information that you definitely aren't going to get by just watching the news. (I will be looking out for the results for cannabis reform throughout the country) For those who still want to watch the news broadcasts, but don't have accress YouTube will be live streaming election coverage from a variety of news sources, including NBC, PBS, MTV, Bloomberg, Telemundo and The Young Turks. There will be also be live coverage from Complex News, during what it is calling a "special election event from YouTube Space NY." I can already tell what my night will look like on Tuesday: I'll have MSNBC on in the background, as I continually refresh Google's more specific election results regarding the senate races around the country. I won't be able to sleep until the final results, which I hope come early.  I might also have a bottle of booze next to me, just in case things start heading south. Take a shot every time Donald Trump wins a state!  Google and YouTube’s get out the vote effort In addition to keeping people informed, Google and YouTube have been among the numerous tech companies helping drive voter turnout this election season. Over the summer, Google launched a new search feature that gave users more information about how to register, including requirements and deadlines, when they typed in "register to vote." Information also included how to vote, who is on the ballot, and how to find a local polling place. It also provided more information about the National Conventions over the summer. When a user would search for it, including a summary of the event, information about the nominee, and a list of speakers, alongside related social media posts and a YouTube live stream video. Google actually released an interesting stat about those improved search features on Monday: as a result, the number of people who searched for "how to vote" rose 233 percent over 2012, so the feature certainly seems to have done its job.  In September, YouTube unveiled its own get out the vote campaign, called #voteIRL. The company partnered with its creator community, including Bethany Mota, Hannah Hart, Kingsley, and Hank Green, who encourage their viewers to register and vote.  The site also put registration reminders on its homepage, watch page, and search results page on September 27, Voter Registration Day, along with voting reminder PSAs, starring President Obama, among others.  Other companies that have made similar efforts to increase voter turnout include Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat and Tinder.

With the launch of Android Auto 2.0, all the functionality of the platform, including the ability to control various apps with voice commands, can be accessed with just an Android smartphone. That includes accessing turn-by-turn directions from Google Maps and playing music from supported streaming apps like Spotify and Google Play. “This update allows anyone with an Android phone (running 5.0 or later) to use a driver friendly interface to access the key stuff you need on the road — directions, music, communications — without the distraction of things that aren’t essential while driving,” said Android Auto product manager Gerhard Schobbe says in an accompanying blog post. “Whether your phone is connected to a compatible car display, or placed in a car mount on the dashboard, Android Auto brings your favorite apps and services into one place, making them accessible in safer and seamless ways.” Previously, taking advantage of Android Auto meant buying a car model that was compatible with the infotainment platform. While more and more car manufacturers are starting to support the platform (the full list can be found here), the number of cars that include Android Auto is still relatively minuscule. The company says it’s rolling out the updated app in the more than 30 countries where Android Auto is already available, which is to say the Android Auto 2.0 should be available in Canada soon. SourceGoogle Karl Dagenais Hope it works better than Automate. Concept was awesome, but not execution. Steve Gallant Same thing with MirrorLink. southerndinner MirrorLink is such a buggy POS ToniCipriani Waze still doesn’t work on it. fred Great. I’m already using google maps in my car but I guess this will make it even better. Cameron Brown The apks are already up on apkmirror. Just make sure you download the correct one for your device’s architecture. Vito R. “You can NOW use Android Auto with almost any car in Canada” “…which is to say the Android Auto 2.0 should be available in Canada soon.” Soooo.. Not now? PeterDTown I don’t see what’s new here, they announced this back in May. I was hoping this was going to tell us that it was now available.

New Masters of the Universe Toys Announced It Turns Out Rats Are Actually Ticklish Gear Up For Final Fantasy XV With This Final Fantasy Gift Guide More Deals The Ultimate Geek Store is Here By Daniel Starkey 11.14.2016 :: 9:45AM EST @dcstarkey Winter is coming! Or, as most of us tend to see it — the season of gifts. Chances are pretty good that if you’re here, you’re either geeky or know someone who is. So we’ve assembled a list of things we think would be great buys for all kinds of nerdy-folks. From the tech-obsessed to the comic fans, here are our top picks. Keep in mind that we’ll be updating this page over the coming weeks and months to give you plenty more ideas if none of these quite fit. Undertale Lullabies Undertale was, without question, one of the best games of last year. That was, in part, thanks to its phenomenal sound track. There’ve been a handful of remix albums made by fans, but the Prescription for Sleep: Undertale was professionally arranged and performed by Metal Gear Solid composer Norihiko Hibino. Even if you’re not looking for a down-tempo album to help you get to sleep, these are some of the best remixes around. If you’re at all a fan of Undertale or know someone who is, this is definitely worth a look. You can get a preview of one of the title track, “Undertale,” here. $10 from Scarlet Moon, Buy it Here Gallium Yeah, we’re seriously just recommending you buy a small hunk of metal. Weird, huh? But if you’re not familiar with it, gallium is actually really, really cool. It’s a silver metal that melts right around 85 degrees Fahrenheit. In other words, you can own a chunk of metal that will actually melt in your hands. And, unlike mercury, it’s not too toxic. I mean, don’t go eating it, obviously, but it’s not going to harm you if you’re just holding it. The metal is obviously a novelty unless you’re looking to do some serious chemistry, but it’s not too expensive and I’ve used it for some fun pranks like handing someone a melting spoon. $9.99 from Amazon, Buy it Here Light Side/Dark Side Light Switch So this is for those the Star Wars but who also likes novelty household items in your life (c’mon, I know you know a few). But if you wanted to get a bit more creative with it, you can put this over a dimmer switch and dance in the middle. I mean, I know grey Jedi haven’t been covered much outside the expanded universe, but Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic‘s Jolee Bindo is cool enough that I’d do that just in his honor. $21.50 from Amazon, Buy it Here Stargate Spinner Ring Anyone out there a Stargate fan? If so, and you’ve got quite a healthy budget for them, why not get them a Stargate spinner ring? As in the shows and 1994 film, the gate’s rings spin to lock in wormholes to other planets. Unfortunately the ring isn’t quite fully functional… yet. $124.99 from Think Geek, Buy it Here Think Geek’s Bag of Holding Think Geek is one of the best resources around for nerdy merchandise, and the Dungeons and Dragons-themed Bag of Holding is one of their most iconic products. I got one of these back in college when I needed a new messenger bag to haul my dorky headphones, my gargantuan 18-inch laptop and a set of clothes to change into after all-night gaming sessions. It took one helluva beating over the years, but it’s still my go-to satchel. These thick canvas bags are tough, and, like their fictional namesake, they can hold way more than you ever thought possible. $49.99 from Think Geek, Buy it Here Pokemon Gym Badges If you’re trying to be the best like no one ever was, then you’ll need a set of gym badges to prove your mettle. This set, available on Etsy is for the Johto region (that would be the setting of Pokemon Gold, Silver, and Crystal) just because it happens to be my favorite set. But these things are pretty easy to find for any of the regions. Just make sure you know which set your giftee likes the best! $45 from Etsy, Buy it Here Geeky Coffee Table Books If you’re the kind of geek that hosts cocktail parties and well-to-do events, you’re probably going to want some snazzy coffee table books for your guests to flip through. Two of our favorites are Geek-art An Anthology: Art, Design, Illustration & Pop Culture which looks at nerdy art over the years and Super Graphic: A Visual Guide to the Comic Book Universe, which includes tons of awesome infographics detailing various facts and relationships from comics. $31.56 from Amazon, Buy it Here “Nobody exists on purpose” framed cross stitch Rick and Morty fans will no doubt recognize this hopelessly existential quote from episode 8, “Rixty Minutes.” It perfectly encapsulates the fatalistic philosophy of the show, but when put into a nicely framed cross stitch pattern, the juxtaposition just kills me. There’s only a few of these left, so grab one while you can. $40 from Etsy, Buy it Here Automatic underbed nightlight Alright, so this one’s just damned practical. If you’ve ever stubbed your toe in the middle of the night, you know how much that sucks. But with a simple kit you can permanently solve that problem by equipping your bed with an automatic light that turns on when you get up. How great is that? $64.50 from Amazon, Buy it Here Super Magnetic putty Who doesn’t love magnets? What about putty? Wouldn’t it be great if you could have both?! Corny intro aside, I loved stuff like this as a kid. I used silly putty to copy and paste newspaper articles onto walls… and I used magnets for all kinds of weird nascent-geek experiments. This is some cool stuff and the kids probably won’t be able to muck with your walls so… yeah. $14.00 from Uncommon Goods, Buy it Here Adult coloring books Coloring books aren’t just for the chitlins anymore. Adults have realized that when they’re favorite characters have been brutally slaughtered, or their ships from canon to fanon, they might need a way to unwind. Enter, adult coloring books. It’s still a coloring book and you have to stay inside the lines and stuff, but now you have… more adult themes. Like Game of Thrones! $13.09 from Amazon, Buy it Here ICE portable speaker Okay so this isn’t technically a licensed Star Wars thing… but I mean… look at it. That’s R2-D2’s head for sure. Plus the speaker floats. And it sounds pretty damned good. If you’ve got the cash for it, you too can have the most adorable bluetooth speaker system for your living room. $149.99 from Amazon, Buy it Here Bioluminescent Aquarium Bioluminescent animals are the absolute coolest, but there’s a catch. Most only live in the deepest parts of the ocean. Which, quite famously, is a place we can’t. But if you’ve got a bit of patience to wait a few weeks for these microorganisms to adapt to your loval climate, you can replicate living on the ocean floor and get a really cool lamp that glows with a soft blue at night. After the initial investment, you just need to buy nutrients from time to time to keep these little ones fed. From $59.95 at Uncommon Goods, Buy it Here Terrarium It’s been pretty well-demonstrated that having a few plants in your work space helps keep mood up and can make you a bit more productive. But, if you’re like me, you’ve got a cat who, while adorable, loves to get into my plants. A terrarium can help bridge that, protecting your tiny plant from your resident troublemaker. All of the benefits without the surprise of cat-puke in the hallway in the middle of the night. $59.95 from Amazon, Buy it Here Google Home Home is Google’s answer to the Amazon Echo — a smart device that searches the web, can order food for you, or give you basic advice on just about anything. And all that for $40 less than Amazon’s Echo. The base is gorgeous, blending modern design aesthetics with functionality. If you’re into home automation and further integrating the internet with your daily life, Google Home is an awesome addition. $129.99 from Google, Buy it Here Ironate Pizza Cooker Listen, I like pizza. Statistically speaking, so do you. But making the perfect pizza at home can be pretty tough — and time-consuming. Even the frozen pizzas from the grocery store usually take 20 minutes to cook through. But, Ironate is a nifty little thing that lets you cook up your favorite Italian knock-off food in just three minutes. It works because pizzas are a food that’s essentially been designed for wood-fired brick overs — and they burn at over 800 degrees. If you’re cooking up a pizza at home, you’re probably not going past 450. Stoves of any sort can reach far greater temps in a couple of minutes, and if you trap that heat effectively, you can cook a pie thoroughly in just a few moments. $139 from Ironate, Buy it Here Magic Wand TV remote Have you ever wanted to shout “Stupefy” while changing the channel to the presidential debate? No? Just me? Okay… well if you wanted to pull that stunt with a bit more flair, you can pick up this Harry Potter-inspired wand-TV remote hybrid. It recognizes certain gestures as channel and volume changes, etc. You won’t get too many advanced TV features out of it, but isn’t that worth it to feel like you can control your TV with MAGIC?! $79.99 from Think Geek, Buy it Here Official Star Trek Tea “Tea. Earl grey. Hot.” Those are some of Picard’s most iconic words from Star Trek: The Next Generation. And now you can make like your favorite (he is your favorite, right?) starship captain and make your own cup of English black tea. Plus you get a snazzy collector’s tin. So, that’s cool too. $28.98 from Amazon, Buy it Here “Don’t fuck up the table” coasters We all have that one friend who gets a little too obsessive with their coffee table. Like, you’ll come in with a room temperature water bottle that won’t possibly leave any kind of ring or damage, and they’ll freak out and yell at you for not using a coaster. This is the gift for them. It’s a little passive-aggressive, sending the idea that they’re a bit too touchy about their table, but it’s so abrasive they’ll (hopefully) probably get a decent chuckle out of it. $16.99 from Amazon, Buy it Here Crabs Adjust Humidity We all know about Cards Against Humanity — the over-played party game we’ve all been a bit bored with for like two years. I mean it was great, but there’s only so many combinations you can get before you’re just over it all. Crabs Adjust Humidity is essentially the same basic idea, but the cards are way more off-the-wall and lends itself to absurdist humor. It’s a great time. But yeah, you’ll probably be bored in a few more years, but in the interim, you can give your parties in the shot in the arm. $36.81 from Amazon, Buy it Here Smart Desk Kit By now, you’ve probably heard about all the positive health benefits to a standing desk, right? But, chances are pretty good when you started looking into them you got a bit of a sticker shock. Standing desks, especially the adjustable kind can often cross the $1,000 mark. Not exactly affordable. With this kit, though, you can build your own for just a couple hundred. You can add other features, too if that’s your jam, like built-in charging stations and a bag holder, but the base model is an excellent deal and comes with an electric motor to adjust your desk height. $199 from Autonomous, Buy it Here Arctis Headphones The Arctis gaming headset is a new line of headphones from manufacturer Steel Series. The company is on the young side, but it’s made huge leaps over the past few years with stellar products like the Siberia 800. With the Arctis, the company’s streamlined the basic design of its headsets, made them a lot more comfortable, and brought in the excellent drivers (that would be the bits of the headphones that actually make the noise) from the Siberia line. That’s notable because a set of Sibera 800s can run just shy of $300, while the Arctis line runs from $79.99 to $149.99. So no matter how you slice it, that’s a damned good deal. From $79.99 on Amazon, Buy it Here Pancake Bot Pancake Printer This thing prints pancakes in any shape you want. I want to say more, BUT IT PRINTS PANCAKES IN ANY SHAPE YOU WANT. Bonus points if you mix in bacon and make ’em bacon pancakes. $235.98 from Amazon, Buy it Here Cryptography gear If you’re a mega cryptographic dork, or just a paranoid denizen of the digital age, you might want to invest in a more old-fashioned layer of security. You can get all kinds of things from Cryptex including this USB drive and even a dead drop capsule. It can be good for a bit of fun in a gift, especially if you’re passing it off to a particularly clever youngster that loves a challenge. $79.95 from Amazon, Buy it Here Whiskey Barrel Aging your own whiskey at home has become an increasingly popular trend. I’ve been doing it for the past couple of years myself, and after plenty of blind taste tests, I can say that it definitely adds another character and dimension to your drink. Sometimes that’s a good thing, sometimes it’s not, but when it works out (try Jameson or Knob Creek) it’s a dream. If you’ve always wanted to get into fiddling with your own recipes, a whiskey aging barrel is a great place to start. Just don’t go pouring in Pappy Van Winkle’s. Trust me, you’re not going to make that any more incredible than it already is. $85 from Uncommon Goods, Buy it Here Bartesian It’s a Keurig for booze. No. That’s it. That’s all I need to say. $299.99 from Bartesian, Buy it Here Multi-device Charging Station You, me, everyone these days has way too many devices. And it can be a pain in the ass to get them all in a good position to charge when you get home after a long day. This is a pretty cheap set-up that gives your gear a good display, keeps them out of the way and gets them all juiced up for tomorrow. $39.99 from Amazon, Buy it Here Powerline Ethernet Adapter It can be pretty tough to get decent internet in every part of your average home. Wifi is often terrible and doesn’t go too far, and Ethernet cords snaking throughout the place are an inelegant solution at best. And for the longest time your solutions came down to one or the other. Recently though, a third option has popped up. You can actually send cat videos and gifs all throughout the home using your power lines. You just need a home with good quality cabling (newer homes are better). Some adapters will have different strengths. Cheaper ones will require that your connection be on the same circuit (i.e. that the lines in your house hit the two outlets you want to connect before returning to your circuit breaker), while some more expensive ones don’t have that restriction. It can be a little tough to work out depending upon how the circuits in your home look, but it’s a relatively cheap, excellent option for lots of folks. I’ve used it for years and I get speeds that are just as good as when I’m wired straight into my house’s router. $59.99 from Amazon, Buy it Here USB Outlet Look, we’ve all got lots of devices that need charging. Between the tablet, the phone, and random other gadgets, it can be a bit much. And carrying around all the chargers for those devices can be a big pain — especially when you lose one. If you have a little bit of electrical expertise, though, you can get an outlet with USB ports built right in. It’s not a game changer, by any means, but it frees up outlets and can make your life just a smidge easier. Worth it, imo. $27.99 from Best Buy, Buy it Here Keyboard cleaner Your keyboard is gross. Look at it. There’s probably dust all in there, you probably don’t rinse it down with rubbing alcohol nearly as often as you should. Besides your phone, it’s the single grossest, most disease-ridden thing you touch on a daily basis. Canned air can help with appearances, but it’s really no substitute for something that can get in all those nooks and crannies. So do yourself and the rest of the people you shake hands with on a daily basis a favor and solve that problem. Rinse your keyboard down with alcohol, then grab something like this gel-based cleaner. It can grab all the little bits of dust and grotty-ness between keycaps. Or, if you’re like me and really, really anal about it… get some Q-tips, soak them in bleach and detail your keyboard about once a week. Either way. Just stop being gross. $1.59 from Light in the Box, Buy it Here Custom designed Xbox One Controller You’re a person, presumably. Complex, interesting. Got your own aesthetic and stuff. Probably. If you play a lot of games, especially with a controller, and have the spare cash you might want to try out Microsoft’s Xbox Design Lab. There, you can get a custom Xbox One controller with whatever colors or styles you like. $79.99 from Microsoft, Buy it Here Legend of Zelda Watch Besides Mario and Pokemon, Zelda’s about the most iconic gaming franchise around. People have Zelda wallets, tattoos, shirts, necklaces, and all kinds of stuff. But most of it is… a little gauche, yeah? Like, show your fandom, sure, but be subtle about it. You don’t need to scream about the things you like (unless that’s a thing you like). Having something that looks good first and is a symbol second is ideal, at least for me. If you’re in the market for a watch and a fan of Zelda, you can get a great time piece that is anything but ostentatious. $59.99 from Think Geek, Buy it Here Vodka Infuser Most geeks like their booze. For a while there, it seemed like the nerds were singlehandedly driving the American craft beer market. But now that the sector has nearly hit saturation, some are turning elsewhere for their ethanol fix. I, for one, make a lot of my own infusions and liquors. I also get some hipster credit because I’ve been doing it for almost five years… so if you want to jump on this bandwagon (trust me, it’s the next big thing) you can start playing with your own infusions. I’d recommend just buying a bit of vodka or Everclear and directly infusing it on your own to start with to see if you like what comes out, but once you’re past that, there’s tons of great tools that can make the process a little easier. As you go, you’ll learn that the process is all about filtering, so having a device that can infuse without the need for extra straining is a huge help. $23.50 from Amazon, Buy it Here Comic Book Style Picture Frame It’s a bit corny, but I’m sure we’ve all imagined what it would be like if we were actually in comics. I won’t say something stupid like “WELL NOW YOU CAN JUST BUY THIS THING,” but if you’ve got some goofy pics of you and your friends, you can definitely spruce them up a bit, and add captions or speech bubbles. Then you can have your favorite inside joke right alongside the moment that inspired it. It’s not the same as being in a comic book, but it’s cute if you’re into that kind of thing. $14.98 from Amazon, Buy it Here USB Type C/3.1 Flashdrive Flash drives are the best. If you’re hanging around with friends and you suddenly decide that you ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO WATCH SPEED RACER RIGHT NOW. AGAIN, but you can’t be assed to go grab the Blu-Ray, it helps to have a portable copy ready to go at all times. Or, if you’re a bit more scrupulous, you can just use it for boring stuff like holding work files or keeping all the programs you need on-hand and ready to install quickly on any computer. But, there’s a problem. USB isn’t quite as universal as it once was. The Type C connector, while super awesome, isn’t backward compatible with any other port — at least not without an adapter. But there are some drives that allow you to switch connectors based on what you need. It’s not an attachment or anything, so there’s nothing to lose. One side is USB 3.1, the other is Type C. Pretty damned convenient. $21.23 from Amazon, Buy it Here HTC Vive The Vive is only a good idea if you’ve got plenty of cash to burn. VR is still in its infancy and while there’s some excellent stuff out there, it’s got a ways to go yet. But, if you’re itching to give it a shot, the Vive is by far the best headset on the market. It uses two scanners to give room-scale VR, meaning that you can walk around and play in a 10x10ft (ish) space. And there’s already some really cool stuff that takes advantage of that. Like Tilt Brush, a google-developed program that lets you paint and sculpt in VR and then walk around your creations. There’s also Space Pirate Trainer, a Galaga-inspired shmup that’s an absolute blast. For most folks it’s not worth the $800, and you also have to consider the beefy gaming PC you’ll need to run the headset. But if you’ve got the cash, the computer and the space in your house, VR is really, REALLY cool. Just don’t expect the Matrix quite yet. $799.99 from Amazon, Buy it Here Cyberoptix A great tie should make a statement. It should be bold but not aggressive. Cyberoptix has excellent options that range from printed periodic tables to cellular structures. All made with high-quality silk. If you’re feeling really snazzy, they’ve also got pocket squares, scarves, and other formal wear accessories. Varies from Cyberoptix, Buy it Here HP Spectre x360 HP’s Spectre x360 is everything you need in a workhorse laptop. With a gorgeous screen, 360-degree hinge, 12 hour battery and tons of other features, it’s a great laptop for everything from keeping you company on long-haul flights or for when you need to crank out a paper on the go. $1189.00 from Amazon, Buy it Here Dell XPS 13 There was a time when Dell was synonymous with chintzy. But after some rough waters, Dell’s done their due diligence and come back with some excellent laptops. Dell’s XPS 13 in particular is a tough, powerful, 13-inch powerhouse, and an excellent choice for those who need a lot of power in a light package. $799 from Amazon, Buy it Here Share Facebook Twitter Linkedin Pinterest Reddit geek store Speak Your Mind More in Deals 11.14.2016 :: 4:30PM EST :: Sheilah Villari Deals Star Trek Gift Guide to Fulfill All Your Starfleet Dreams Deals 11.14.2016 :: 11:00AM EST :: K.

As it turns out, iFixit has given Google’s little smart home device a rather high repairability score, encountering only a few roadblocks along the way. iFixit gives Google Home an overall repairability score of 8/10. The only time it seems the crew at iFixit struggled with the teardown was in removing the Home’s capacitive touch board from the top of the device’s plastic shell. This board is what gives Google Home its touch surface capabilities, and it’s held to the shell with a seemingly absurd amount of adhesive tape. Other than that, though, getting inside the device and at the internals seems like a fairly straightforward process assuming you have the correct tools. Those tools include T6 and T8 Torx screwdrivers, a pair of tweezers, and iFixit’s own iOpener set. It should be noted that Google Home scored slightly higher on repairability than the Amazon Echo, which took home a score of 7/10. READ MORE: Living with Google HomeThat could be because Google Home’s hardware sports a modular design, making it easier to swap out parts as necessary. Google Home also uses a small number of moving parts, decreasing the number of possible points of failure. Finally, iFixit found that a lot of the hardware in Google Home is also found in last year’s Chromecast. This means that spare parts should relatively easy to obtain should anything with your Google Home go wrong.

As always iFixit has gotten their hands on one and taken it completely apart to have a peek at what powers the device. Perhaps unsurprisingly, it looks as though Google has reused some of its hardware from previous products, as the CPU, flash, and RAM found in the device are the same used in last year’s Chromecast. Everything is powered by a Marvell 88DE3006 Armada 1500 Mini Plus dual-core ARM Cortex-A7 media processor, while the speaker itself is powered by a Peerless PLS-50N25AL07-04. Perhaps most interestingly is the device scored pretty high on iFixit’s repairability score, earning an 8 out of 10 for the device. That’s better than Amazon’s Echo competitor, which only scored a 7 out of 10. Google Home is currently available from the Google Store for $129.99, but also from retailers like Target, Walmart, and Best Buy.   local_offer    Google Home   Auto-load comments: Off On View comments (8) stars Further Reading Third-party Google Assistant tools coming You can now buy extra bases for your Google H Google Home is now available 20 fun things to try with Google Home Google Home spotted on Walmart shelves early stars Popular this Weeklaunch 1 more_vertThis may be the Moto X 2017 closeHere’s our first look at the 2017 Moto X The Moto X 2017 may be alive and well as a new image has appeared which shows off the device’s metal body and camera cutout. 2 more_vertExclusive: Project ARA specifications, design closeExclusive: Project ARA specifications, design and photos Today’s exclusive Google Project ARA post reveals the phone’s spec sheet and 40 images which show off the phone’s unique modular design. 3 more_vertZTE wants to step up and fill the Nexus gap closeZTE wants to fill the gap left behind with the end of Nexus devices With the end of the Nexus line, there’s now a void in stock Android devices in the $400 range.

Visitors walk past an advertisement for Samsung Electronics' Galaxy S7 Edge and Gear VR during the Korea Electronics Grand Fair at an exhibition hall in Seoul on October 27. The company's next AI-equipped Galaxy S smartphone will prove crucial to repairing Samsung's reputation after it was discovered the Note 7 device was prone to bursting into flames.  (JUNG YEON-JE / AFP/GETTY IMAGES)   By Jungah LeeBloomberg Mon., Nov. 7, 2016 Samsung Electronics Co. plans to equip its next Galaxy S smartphones with a Siri-like digital assistant, seeking to make a comeback after the global debacle that precipitated the death of its flawed Note 7 lineup. Samsung, which last month acquired U.S.-based artificial-intelligence software company Viv Labs Inc., said the Galaxy S8 slated for next year will come with AI-enabled features “significantly differentiated” from those of Apple Inc.’s Siri or Google, executive vice-president Rhee In-jong told reporters. Those services now offer up potentially useful information from the weather to flight times based on user activity. The flagship Galaxy S line will prove crucial to salvaging Samsung’s reputation in the wake of the fiasco surrounding a Note 7 device prone to bursting into flame. The recall and eventual cessation of the line is estimated to cost upwards of $6 billion and pushed profits at its mobile division to a record low in the September quarter. The company is now investigating the root cause behind the fires, but wouldn’t comment on progress so far. “It will be significantly differentiated from the current services we see in the market now,” Rhee said of the S8’s features. He said last month the company plans to embed Viv’s technology in other electronics and home appliances beyond phones. Samsung shares rose 1.1 per cent in Seoul trading Monday and had gained 29 per cent this year before today. Article Continued Below Global technology players are vying to build devices attuned to users’ lifestyles and daily behaviour. Amazon is trying to sign up more developers for its Alexa voice technology, while Apple has recently touted more Siri capabilities and opened the technology to other developers. Google, considered the leader in artificial intelligence, is making its own push. Samsung is now getting into the game. It releases new versions of its top-tier Galaxy S series sometime in the first quarter of every year, typically during the Mobile World Congress in Spain. With the Note 7 line now defunct, the S8 will become its de facto showcase smartphone. The company is keen to put the Note 7 behind it and resuscitate its business. Samsung reported a sharp decline in profit as the Note 7 recall took its toll. Net income fell 17 per cent to 4.41 trillion won ($5.17 billion Canadian) in the third quarter, bringing its mobile profit to a historic low of 100 billion won. Samsung suffered a separate setback with a different product last week. The company is recalling about 2.8 million washing machines in the U.S. amid reports that the top of the machine can become detached during use. Samsung said in a Nov. 4 statement that it will offer consumers a free in-home repair of the machine, or a rebate that can be used when consumers buy a new machine. For more recent purchases, consumers can get a full refund. Read more about: United States, Google, Samsung The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.

 Google Home costs $50 less than Amazon Echo because it's made of older, cheaper parts Ben Gilbert Nov. 7, 2016, 12:10 PM 6,543 facebook linkedin twitter email print Google's got a brand new product in a brand new product category: It's called Google Home, and it's a hybrid personal assistant/speaker. Hollis Johnson/Business Insider It looks like a little speaker, but it's actually a voice-activated personal assistant — simply say, "Okay Google" and your command. "Okay Google, what's the weather?" for instance, or "Okay Google, what's the closest pizza shop?" You've got questions, it's got answers.  If the idea sounds familiar, that's probably because you've heard of Amazon's Echo — it's a speaker that lives in your home that's also full of microphones, ready for your every (voice) command. This guy right here: Amazon There are some crucial differences between the two: Home is powered by Google's AI "Assistant" software, while Echo is powered by Amazon's AI "Alexa" software. Home is shorter and squatter than the Echo. Home costs just $129, while Echo costs $179. It's that last bit that we're concerned with here — the price difference is crucial, especially considering how similar the two are. Given how both devices share much of the same functionality, what's causing the $50 price difference?  From the looks of a new teardown, it's a simple measure of the components used. Simply put: Google Home is made out of existing products that Google already sells, making it far less expensive to manufacture. iFixit discovered as much in a teardown of Google Home it published this week. The chips powering Home, for instance, are the same chips that previously appeared in 2015's Chromecast device. Google Google's device also has far fewer microphones — just two to Echo's seven. And that could make a huge difference in these devices' ability to hear your commands, which is its main form of input. Indeed, voice control is the entire raison d'être of these devices. In my personal use of Google Home across the past week, I've encountered few instances where the device couldn't hear me — but even one repeated command is enough to make you feel like an idiot. Who wants to repeatedly shout at a robot?  In any case, if you're wondering which of these two devices is right for you — and wondering why there's such a large price discrepancy — now you're armed with more info than ever. Check out the full teardown of Google Home for even more! Disclosure: Jeff Bezos is an investor in Business Insider through his personal investment company Bezos Expeditions.

The Mountain View, California-based company notes that iPhone and iPad users can now download the new Gmail app that Google promises is faster than the previous version. In addition to having the ability to add multiple accounts and swiping to archive and delete messages, Google has also brought several Inbox feature to users, specifically the ability to Undo Sending emails in order to “prevent embarrassing mistakes.” This feature has also been available in the desktop version of Gmail for some time now. Search in Gmail has also been revamped and features faster results as well as spelling suggestions. Overall, the app’s functionality more closely resembles the desktop and Android version of Google’s mail client. SourceGoogle Marc Palumbo The Gmail app has become terrible.

They said that in the past, a click from a search result to eBay would often be to an eBay search result itself. Those of us in the SEO world know Google hates search results going to more search results. Google killed directories in their results and those kinds of results are similar. With eBay's new browse pages, they have organized the results to be more what a consumer would expect to see when clicking a search result. The pages include pictures of various similar items broken down by brand, type and price and include summary descriptions. eBay Says This Move Was Prompted by Millennials "We’ve noticed something lately," said eBay in a blog post. "New online shopping patterns have emerged, especially with Millennial buyers. Instead of visiting specific online retailers for a single-purchase transaction, shoppers are using search engines to turn up results based on keywords." They say that this behavioral change is because buyers are looking for inspiration and guidance, and they’re more inclined to explore and discover to find what they want. I could be wrong, but it sounds like it was more of an SEO play than a reaction to new Millennial behavior. But, whatever the reason, it's definitely a better page for the Googler to land on than another set of search results. Made Possible by Structured Data and RPIs Earlier this year eBay announced to the consternation of some of their sellers that all products would be requiring Required Product Identifiers (RPIs). This structured data enabled eBay to make these new "browse pages" and helps them improve the shopping experience for buyers. eBay told their sellers: "The most amazing part? All of these improvements were made possible by you. By adding Structured Data and Required Product Identifiers (RPIs) information to your listings, you allowed us to better organize site inventory and create a new, more relevant shopping experience for eBay buyers."

Signal app-maker rebuts criticism of dev direction by calling for more community help Posted Nov 7, 2016 by Natasha Lomas (@riptari) 0 SHARES Next Story Microsoft open sources its Azure Container Service Engine and launches deeper Kubernetes integration Moxie Marlinspike, founder of Open Whisper Systems (OWS), the not-for-profit software group behind the respected Signal Protocol crypto (and the eponymous Signal secure messaging app) has responded to criticism of how the group is developing its projects by calling for more contributions from the community to broaden implementations of the protocol. “I invite those who have opinions about Signal to start by getting involved in the project,” he writes in a comment on Hacker News. “Many of these points are things that we would like to address, and we could use the help. The day to day reality of developing apps like these is a lot of work.” Marlinspike’s comments were triggered by a blog post written by web developer Sander Venema in which Venema said he would no longer be recommending Signal to investigative journalists to secure their comms. Not on account of the crypto protocol itself but because of how the project is being run. He flags several objections to OWS’s direction of travel, including its lack of support for a fork of the Signal protocol, called LibreSignal, which had removed the need to rely on Google Cloud Messaging (GCM) in favor of Web Sockets. For users of Android who had a custom ROM rather than the Google Play version of the OS, the fork of Signal offered an easy-to-use “Google-free” alternative — something of value to those concerned about surveillance by an ad targeting giant, not just state surveillance activity. However after Marlinspike told the developers of LibreSignal to stop using Signal’s name and servers, back in May, they abandoned the project. He had complained it was complex and expensive for OWS to accommodate LibreSignal on its servers. On this, Venema writes: “Unfortunately, the policy decisions of OpenWhisperSystems and Moxie Marlinspike make it so that it became impossible to reliably run unofficial Signal clients that use the same server infrastructure, so people can communicate.” He also says the blog post as triggered by seeing Signal spending resources adding support for GIF search, rather than more serious features. Marlinspike’s rebuttal of Venema’s criticism is to point out he has called for the community to make a pull request for Websocket-only support in Signal multiple times, and no one has so far stepped up: I have said many times that I have no problem with supporting these custom ROMs. But I would like someone from that community to submit the PR: “I would consider a clean, well written, and well tested PR for websocket-only support in Signal. I expect it to have high battery consumption and an unreliable user experience, but would be fine with it if it comes with a warning and only runs in the absence of play services.” Nobody has done it. He also emphasizes that no data is transmitted over GCM. (Although it’s not clear whether some usage metadata might not be transmitted to Google via this route.) “GCM is only used as a push event to tell the Signal Android client to wake up and connect to the Signal server to retrieve messages from the queue if the app isn’t in the foreground,” he writes. Venema also speculates that Google could be strong-armed by intelligence agencies to serve a “specially modified update or version of Signal to specific targets for surveillance” — arguing it’s therefore “strongly preferable to run a secure messaging client on a more secure platform”. “Currently when it comes to Signal this cannot be done in any official way, and it would help for the people who really need secure messaging services (instead of the people who merely use it as a replacement of say WhatsApp), if the software runs on other Android distributions, like Copperhead,” he argues. There is a way to use Signal without depending on GCM — by using microg — but Venema says this is way too complex for non-technical users, given it can require a user to re-compile their kernel. Whereas LibreSignal’s approach had, in his view, lowered the barrier to entry. Yet that project withered on the vine after OWS withdrew support. He also calls out OWS for what he describes as “expressly” hindering and prohibiting federation — meaning LibreSignal cannot run their own servers and then federate within the wider Signal network. “I don’t see the point of doing any of this secure messaging stuff, without having federation. The internet was built on federation,” he writes. “If we don’t federate, if we don’t cooperate, what is there to stop the internet from becoming a bunch of proprietary walled gardens again? Is the internet then really nothing more than just a platform for us to use certain proprietary silo services on? Signal then, just happens to be a (partly proprietary) silo on which your messages are transmitted securely.” Responding to this criticism, Marlinspike claims the Signal clients and server do already support federation. Although this is clearly a technical possibility, rather than something Signal has set out to actively support and encourage. On the contrary, Marlinspike has argued it is no longer possible to build a competitive federated messenger — which is why OWS built Signal as an unfederated service. His previously stated view is that federation freezes development and is just not appropriate for a fast-moving app ecosystem — pointing to WhatsApp being able to introduce end to end encryption across its entire user base “with a single software update” as an example of the advantage of centralization vs federation. “Once you federate your protocol, it becomes very difficult to make changes. And right now, at the application level, things that stand still don’t fare very well in a world where the ecosystem is moving,” he wrote back in May (when he also said OWS would be “unlikely to ever federate with clients and servers we don’t control”). “Nothing about any of the protocols we’ve developed requires centralization; it’s entirely possible to build a federated Signal Protocol based messenger, but I no longer believe that it is possible to build a competitive federated messenger at all,” he added at the time. Yesterday Marlinspike appeared to soften his view slightly, by saying: “I would love it if someone proved me wrong”, as well as offering help for others to start a federated network using the protocol. “There shouldn’t be any technical hurdles stopping the people who are really into federation from using our software to start their own federated network that demonstrates the viability of their ideas”, he writes. Although he also reiterates his preference for running Signal as a centralized service by arguing it has other potential advantages — such as for developing new protocols to bolster metadata protection. “The nice thing about having a centralized service is that we can eventually take steps in this direction,” he says. “People seem to equate federation with meta-data hiding for reasons I’ve never totally understood, but I think serious metadata protection is going to require new protocols and new techniques, so we’re much more likely to see major progress in centralized rather than distributed environments (in the same way that Signal Protocol is now on over two billion devices, but we’re unlikely to ever see even basic large scale email end to end encryption).” Another of Venema’s criticisms is that Signal associates phone numbers with names — meaning a user’s contacts’ list is not private. He argues that using usernames to connect users would be a superior approach from a privacy point of view, as well as also helping support federation. On this, Marlinspike notes that on Android 6+ users of Signal have the ability to disable contacts permissions without the app not working. But he goes on to concede that metadata in general is an area where OWS would “like to do even better” (such as by developing the aforementioned new protocol). Early last month OWS revealed it had received its first subpoena for user data, although it claimed the only data it can produce in response to such a request is the date and time a user registered with Signal, and the last date of a user’s connectivity to the Signal service. And Marlinspike’s verdict is that things are “playing out alright” in terms of how much user data can be strong-armed from the service at this point, even without a better fix for metadata. Venema is also critical of OWS for not open sourcing the phone component of Signal (aka RedPhone). Which means people forking the protocol are prevented from running their own phone servers — and likely explains why secure encrypted calls don’t work in alternative apps such as LibreSignal. “I don’t know exactly what prevents the RedPhone server code from being released (whether it is legal issues or simple unwillingness), but I do think it is strange that there is no movement whatsoever to move to a different/alternative solution, that respects users’ rights,” he writes. Marlinspike makes no direct comment on this critique — beyond his general rebuttal of OWS having limited development resources. We’ve reached out to him directly with questions on the RedPhone open sourcing point and will update this post with any response. Like Marlinspike, Venema also ultimately calls for a wider pro-privacy community to address the concerns he’s raising and work together to build more secure services. “We as a community need to come up with a viable solution and alternative to Signal that is easy to use and that does in fact respect people’s choices, both in the hardware and software that they choose to run,” he writes. “We need to cooperate more as a community instead of creating these little islands, otherwise we are not going to succeed in defeating or even meaningfully defending against Big Brother. “Remember, our enemy knows how to divide and conquer. Divide et impere. It’s been a basic government subjugation tactic since the Roman times. We should not allow our own petty egos and quest for eternal hacker fame to get in the way of our actual goal: dismantling the surveillance states globally.” 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Signal Founded 2009 Overview Signal (formerly BrightTag) is a cross-channel marketing company that provides cloud-based marketing technologies for brands and digital agencies.

Are voting machines malfunctioning? Provisional ballots being handed out? Voters being inappropriately asked for ID or being harassed? In short: are citizens able to exercise their right to vote?  Already stories have surfaced of long voting lines in Nevada and Georgia, where an unusually high number of voters cast their vote ahead of Election Day. More than 150 people are expected to crowd into the student newsroom at the CUNY Graduate School of Journalism in New York’s Times Square. Professional journalists and students will join data experts from Google and other companies for pizza, coffee, and snacks, and to sift through a deluge of data on that day’s voting. It will be the hub of a group called Electionland, led by the nonprofit news site ProPublica, Google News Lab, CUNY, and others. They hope Electionland will leverage social media and other data sources to surface and flag suspicious voting situations. Systematically monitoring voting is hard because it is supervised by local officials, making it tough for groups to highlight concerns quickly, says Derek Willis, a data journalist and developer at ProPublica and part of the Electionland team. “A national election is really 50 state elections,” says Willis. Electionland is a bid to take the wide reach and accessibility of platforms such as Facebook and Twitter and use that to monitor and improve the voting process. Willis and others involved readily admit that information coming from social media and Google search trends are at best an imperfect measure and at worst subject to manipulation. “It will be just as much about debunking false claims as identifying the problems,” says Carrie Brown, director of the social journalism program at CUNY. Charles Stewart, a political science professor at MIT and an expert on voting, says he is “very, very worried” about the potential that Electionland’s focus on social media could be susceptible to manipulation and that news organizations, drawn in by the immediacy of the information coming through on social media, might rush out information before it is properly vetted for accuracy. Disseminating information on issues such as the length of voting lines, even if accurate, could have the negative effect of discouraging voter turnout, he says. Just as problematic, much of social media is not representative of the broader public. “It is skewed urban, toward tech-savvy white men. It is skewed in a lot of ways,” says Stewart. To minimize those issues, Electionland’s creators have tried to pull data from a variety of sources and create a system to critically vet the information that surfaces. Though much of the data will come into Electionland from automated systems, its review will require a significant amount of human judgment. Six hundred student volunteers will use tools like Facebook Signal and Dataminr to pick up on hot issues on social media platforms. In addition, the public will be able to send concerns directly to Electionland via text message. The group will pull in leads on election irregularities phoned in to a hotline run by the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights. Students will try to verify the authenticity and significance of various signals with tools like reverse image searches (to determine if a photo has been in circulation before) and geolocation (to determine whether a text is coming from near a polling place in question). Professional journalists will then review issues that pass the students’ evaluation, and if the pros agree, the leads will be sent to local reporters around the country who have signed up to check out questions about polling places in their area. “There is no magic box here,” Willis says. “As with most civic-oriented projects there is no algorithm that does the job without human input.” From Our Advertisers In partnership with Dynatrace Emerging Trend Analysis: What is Digital Performance Management?

It lets you view compatible apps from your smartphone on the car's main head unit display, leaving you to keep your eyes on the road and ultimately be a safer driver. Google is all too aware that some people don't have an Android Auto head unit, either their car doesn't come with one, or there isn't room to install an aftermarket one. To solve this, Google announced an update for Android phones running Android 5.0 or later that will add a simplified version of Android Auto. That update has now been pushed via Google Play, meaning you can now get a similar Android Auto experience in your car using your phone's screen, without having to connect your phone to the car's system. The mobile version provides a simplified interface that gives you basic information from the apps it thinks you'll need: Google Maps, music and calls/messaging. You can use hands-free commands to make calls, send messages, get directions and change music tracks - and read your messages to you. The update will also automatically connect your phone to your car's built-in Bluetooth if it has it, or a Bluetooth car mount such as the Logitech SmartCar Mount. You'll have to use voice commands to find a contact to call for example, rather than being able to use your steering wheel controls, but auto launching should make it a seamless experience. Android Auto explored: Taking Google on the road Google says it's working on enhancing hands-free voice commands so you'll be able to carry out current commands by saying "Ok Google", no matter what app or screen is currently active. For example you could be in Maps and ask Google to change the song, without having to exit Maps. It may only be required for Android phones that don't have Google Assistant, as Assistant can be accessed from anywhere on the phone. Some older phones require you to be on the home screen. Now that we have the Android Auto update, we'll be giving it a test and bringing you more information as soon as we can. The Android Auto update is rolling out now but to save you constantly checking the Play Store, you can sign up on the Android Auto website to be notified when it's available to download. So far we've got it working on the Moto Z and Google Pixel phones, so suspect it will be rolling out quickly.

Samsung said it will be making more AI acquisitions as it plays catch-up with Google and others. Greg Sterling on November 7, 2016 at 9:14 am More The Galaxy Note 7 debacle has been tough on Samsung, as the company continues to pay for its shortcuts and mistakes. The Korean giant faces billions in lost sales as well as lasting damage to its reputation. Will a shiny new virtual assistant in phones help the company rehabilitate itself? Samsung said yesterday it would be incorporating a new virtual assistant into the forthcoming Galaxy S8. The virtual assistant will be based on Viv, which was acquired by Samsung last month. It was a “me too” maneuver but one with significant implications for Samsung’s broader product lines, such as TVs and home appliances. Viv was co-created by Dag Kittlaus, who ran Siri before Apple bought it. Samsung needed AI and a virtual assistant product to compete with Google (its frenemy) and Apple (its nemesis) going forward, while Viv probably needed more capital and resources to realize its ambitious vision. It may turn out to be a devil’s bargain for Kittlaus and his team; they may never be able to bring the product experience they envisioned to market. AI is now a competitive necessity for big tech companies and Samsung said that it will be making future AI acquisitions. It also hopes to build a third-partly developer ecosystem for Viv (or whatever the assistant name turns out to be) as Google and Apple are doing for the Google Assistant and Siri. Samsung creates a lot of reactive, “me too” experiences, that follow Google and Apple (e.g., S Voice, Samsung Pay). Based on that history, I don’t expect Viv on the S8 to be differentiating in the way Samsung hopes. In addition, Viv will have to contend with the competitive presence of Google’s own Assistant. As I’ve previously argued, however, the real value of Viv for Samsung will likely come through its integration into other products and smart home appliances, where it could truly shine.

SUBSCRIBE Holiday optimization tips for remaining competitive in the SERP Columnist Lydia Jorden discusses ways to stay competitive in local search during the holidays, when competition for positioning gets particularly intense. Lydia Jorden on November 7, 2016 at 9:29 am More During the holidays, we often let a fair part of ourselves go: diet, exercise, budgets and more. But for local search engine optimization (SEO) professionals, there is something very impactful that can get away from us little by little, until it is completely out of control: Rankings. During the holiday season, we sometimes neglect a variety of strategies that help our businesses maintain positioning within the local pack during a high-traffic time. If you find yourself experiencing a case of holiday ranking drops, you may want to avoid a Scrooge-like boss muttering “humbug” under his breath until the ranking decrease can be remedied. Once we secure top local positioning, we must maintain and continue to keep up with user search trends — even during the holidays. Don’t neglect your accounts during the holiday season; instead, implement monthly tracking strategies that allow you to continue maintaining position with a few key tips. Google Trends One audit that I like to perform every quarter that is especially important during the holidays is a keyword analysis to determine if searcher behavior shifted from one query to one that is synonymous. The Google Trends tool allows me to quickly determine what keywords receive the heaviest monthly search volume (in comparison to one another). Once I figure out those keywords, I can modify my website and alter the content to capitalize on the potential change in searcher behavior that occurs during the holidays. This strategy works particularly well for a website that offers products or services with names that are synonymous with other types of products or those that have abbreviations. This could be a healthcare website that wants let patients know they can seek care during the holidays or keep those patients abreast of holiday hours. See an example pulled from Google Trends pulled for the past five years in the United States: Blue denotes: “hospitals open on christmas” search query. Red denotes: “urgent care open on christmas day” search query. Yellow denotes: “christmas day urgent care” search query. If I were a hospital or healthcare organization with the information above, I would use it to determine if I need to change my content strategy. A valuable way to secure positioning during the holidays is to include or bolster content that speaks about holiday hours in order to target high-volume search queries. In the case above, I would make sure to use the term “urgent care open on christmas day” if I wanted to highlight this phrase, rather than the other two that have lower search volume. Updating holiday hours on Google My Business Last year, Google rolled out the ability to create special hours for specific days, like the upcoming holiday season, in an effort to continue creating a seamless user experience. To change your Google My Business local listing hours, follow the steps outlined below: Log into your Google My Business account. Click to navigate to the Info tab. Scroll down and click “Add special hours.” Populate accordingly for holidays or any other days where hours differ from your regularly posted hours. Adding special hours allows for a seamless user experience and allows customers to find you during the times that you are open. If you extend hours for the holidays or close early, customers will get a notification when they click for directions. This functionality alleviates customer frustration, and it also potentially increases sales if hours are extended. Content Building content around holiday services, deals or product offerings can help a business stay competitive within the SERP, as well as the local pack, because searcher behavior can switch toward holiday-related search queries for businesses that seek additional customers during the holiday season. Updating the description in Google My Business and other local search directory listings to holiday-related content that focuses on service offerings (and your product) can help local pack positioning around the holiday season. When Google detects that your local listings have consistent NAP (name, address and phone number) information, along with consistent information that speaks to a user’s search query, it’s more likely your business will rank within the local 3-pack. If you’re a Chinese restaurant (or similar business) competing in New York City (or your respective area) for positioning in the local 3-pack, this is something you’ll want to pay attention to. In 2014, the term “Chinese restaurant” saw a 100-percent increase in search volume on December 25 in New York City and Toronto. That’s a serious potential sales boost! Boost your listing to appear more often by modifying the description to catch a searcher’s eye and boast about being open on Christmas Day. Having a description that speaks to being open may increase your chances of a click-through (which plays into local search positioning, since Google wants to show listings that get more clicks). Creating a blog content and a social media strategy that speaks to the locality of your business in accordance with holidays can also help elevate local search positioning and give your company an edge over competitors. Blogs that focus on specific product offerings during Thanksgiving, Christmas, Hanukkah and New Year’s can influence where you rank, as some searches are switching to including a holiday-type modifier within his/her search. Happy holidays! Stay conscious of how competitors are competing in the local SERPs over the holiday season, and be aware that searcher behavior can change rapidly with the seasons. Keeping the above strategies in mind can help further elevate your brand within the local pack and gain visibility over competitors to keep your business present in the local SERP.

Though the basic features remain the same, you’ll still have access to all of your Gmail labels and the new search feature. You can easily add multiple accounts, and the app shows the style you’ve picked for your Inbox. The new colors are bright, emails have an avatar showing you the sender and you can easily switch between accounts. Google also added another update to the Calendar app for the iPhone app Monday. Not much has changed with the Calendar app, but Google did add some cool features: Events and reminders are now integrated into the iPhone search. That means if you’re looking to make Google Calendar your main option, it should be much smoother for you.

The biggest feature for the Gmail iOS app update is the ability to Undo Send, a feature that prevents you from making some pretty stupid mistakes. How to use Gmail’s Undo Send Feature on Your iPhone: From your computer, sign into your Gmail account. In the top right, click on Settings. In the “Undo Send” section, simply check the box next to the “Enable Undo Send.” You’ll then be able to set the amount of time you want to unsound an email. The Undo Send feature on the mobile app can be set to 5 seconds, while the Undo Send feature on the web can be set to 5, 10, 20 or 30 second-delay.

The interface, which pares back Android into a chunkier, more finger-friendly layout for use while driving, while hiding the more complex features that could prove a distraction, is being released as a standalone system, Google announced today. It’s the closest we’ve got so far to an admission by the Android team that Android Auto adoption among automakers may not have been as swift as they would’ve preferred. Android Auto launched in early 2015 as a feature of Lollipop. Much in the same way that Apple’s CarPlay allowed iPhone owners to plug their smartphone into their car’s systems and have it project a simplified interface into the built-in dashboard display, Android Auto promised a safer, more intuitive way of interacting with Google’s OS. The system launched first on the Hyundai Sonata in May 2015. Since then, several cars have added support for the system, though it’s still not especially common. Google says Android Auto is now available on over 200 models of car, with more than 50 brands involved. They span the gamut from sensible sedan through to more luxury brands, too. On those vehicles which do offer Android Auto – and, for that matter, CarPlay – however, it’s often a paid upgrade, requiring a more expensive infotainment system than is installed as standard. Although Google has so far voiced nothing but enthusiasm for its automaker partners, today’s news of a standalone Android Auto version seems a tacit indication that it’s not willing to wait forever for them to play ball. Instead, it’ll be a standalone feature of any Android device running 5.0 or above. Functionally, Android Auto on phones will be much the same as it is when plugged into a car’s infotainment system, only rather than using an in-dash display it’ll rely on the smartphone’s touchscreen. The same hands-free navigation, music, calling, and messaging support will be included. In fact, there’ll be more support for voice added over the coming weeks, the Android Auto team says. That includes enabling the “Ok Google” trigger phrase, so that Google Maps, Google Music, and other services can be summoned without ever touching the screen. Android Auto 2.0 will also include Bluetooth launching. With a compatible mount – such as the Logitech SmartCar Mount – the interface can be set to load automatically whenever the phone is docked. Logitech’s system uses a magnetic cradle which, with the right adapter on a smartphone, can hold the device in place without clips or brackets. According to the Android team, the new Android Auto 2.0 is rolling out over the next few days, so if you’re not seeing it right now then a little patience may be in order. Unfortunately, this doesn’t mean that countries where Android Auto hasn’t been offered so-far will be getting in on the system. Initially, at least, it’ll be the 30+ locations where cars have already been served.

Google Launches Mobile-First Index Experiment: Here Is Everything We Know About It. Nov 7, 2016 • 9:03 am | (64) by Barry Schwartz | Filed Under Google Search Engine Optimization Prev Story Next Story As most of you already know, Google announced Friday afternoon that they are going live with their test of their "mobile-first" index. I covered the breaking news on Search Engine Land and waited here, as I normally do to get the industry reaction and oh boy, we have a ton more to share with you about this mobile first index. First, we knew this was coming but I am surprised they announced it so soon being that they said recently they have a lot to figure out with this. But I guess they want to let people know, they are now testing it on a subset of users/index to work out more of the kinks. What is a mobile-first index? First thing, is what is changing with this mobile-first index? In short, Google will crawl and index the mobile version of your site as its primary source for content and ranking signals for your site. Before, Google did this on the desktop site, which we discussed many many times. Google said they "primarily use the mobile version of a site’s content to rank pages from that site, to understand structured data, and to show snippets from those pages in our results." Will Google maintain two different indexes? Desktop and mobile? Google wrote in their blog post, "our search index will continue to be a single index of websites and apps." But it is not 100% clear because the previous Google communication made it sound like there would be two indexes for this. Paul Haahr from Google, a senior senior person there on indexing, said no - they will have one index only. He said this on Twitter. He said a separate index won't happen: .@jenstar … index of mobile pages for mobile users and index of desktop pages for desktop users. Won't happen. (cc @goutaste @BermanHale)— Paul Haahr (@haahr) November 6, 2016 Adding, it might be interpreted as a separate index but it is not: .@jenstar But I wouldn't interpret an experiment of any sort as a separate index in the sense of … (cc @goutaste @BermanHale)— Paul Haahr (@haahr) November 6, 2016 He did say for the testing period, maybe but he is unsure: .@jenstar I'd expect many different experiments. Maybe a separate index would be part of them, maybe not. (cc @goutaste @BermanHale)— Paul Haahr (@haahr) November 6, 2016 Adding that it is clear from their communication that it is one single index: .@BermanHale The blog post is pretty clear: “our search index will continue to be a single index of websites and apps.”— Paul Haahr (@haahr) November 5, 2016 So just like there is one desktop index, it will be one mobile index going forward: .@BermanHale In other words, same as it ever was, just crawling mobile pages instead of desktop pages.— Paul Haahr (@haahr) November 5, 2016 When is the mobile-first index launching? Well, it is live for some subset of users now but it is limited. It will gradually be pushed out to more and more searchers as Google wants to test it on more and more users. Eventually, it will replace the desktop index fully and Google will move on from this experiment and on to others. Google wrote in their blog post "we'll continue to carefully experiment over the coming months on a small scale and we'll ramp up this change when we're confident that we have a great user experience." But Gary Illyes said again, after the announcement that they are still months away from launching it: @ThisIsAJames i dunno. We're months away from that— Gary Illyes (@methode) November 5, 2016 What type of impact will this cause to webmasters? Googlers are pretty much saying they don't expect this to have much of an impact at all. In fact, they said even if you do not have a mobile site, they will use the desktop version. Google wrote on their blog post, "if you only have a desktop site, we'll continue to index your desktop site just fine, even if we're using a mobile user agent to view your site." Gary Illyes from Google said he expects very little impact, he said "we're aiming for close to quality-neutral launch; ideally there wouldn't be too much delta". @denstopa @krystianszastok I think, *think*, we're aiming for close to quality-neutral launch; ideally there wouldn't be too much delta— Gary Illyes (@methode) November 5, 2016 Paul Haahr from Google said you really shouldn't see anything at this point during the test: .@BritneyMuller I would be very surprised to detect any effects of mobile-first indexing at this stage (cc @BermanHale)— Paul Haahr (@haahr) November 6, 2016 Ultimately, Google doesn't expect or want this to be a 'geddon' of any type: Mobile-first: with ONLY a desktop site you'll still be in the results & be findable. Recall how mobilegeddon didn't send anyone to oblivion?— Gary Illyes (@methode) November 6, 2016 What if I have less content on mobile than desktop? If you have less content on your mobile version than on your desktop version - Google will probably see the less content mobile version. Google said they are indexing the mobile version first. Here are some tweets from Gary on this: @krystianszastok yes— Gary Illyes (@methode) November 5, 2016 If that means your mobile version should get hit by Panda, then so be it Gary adds: @emerikusz_ whoa, great question! Theoretically yes, in practice I don't know yet— Gary Illyes (@methode) November 6, 2016 Gary again saying, the content on your mobile version is more important now: @willohara because the mobile index will be the primary one so whatever you have in the desktop pages will not be as valuable— Gary Illyes (@methode) November 7, 2016 But if your mobile version has no content, Google likely will look at the desktop version: @willohara if no mobile content at all then your page will be indexed and ranked based on desktop content— Gary Illyes (@methode) November 7, 2016 Even more so, Google seems to be changing on hidden content on mobile so that Google will give full weight to content within tabs, accordions, drop downs and so on. Mobile-first index is a global, worldwide rollout Gary said this is not like when Panda launched which was just in English US first, this will be a global roll out. @jpzupancic global— Gary Illyes (@methode) November 7, 2016 What about links missing on mobile vs desktop? My gut tells me Google will treat content as they do links with mobile versus desktop. So if you are missing links on your mobile version that you have on desktop, Google will probably not count them. But I think Google is at the stage where they are testing this and they want to reserve the answer on this until later. Gary said, they need to see: @jennyhalasz @schachin I don't want to say anything definite about links yet. It's too early for that cos things are very much in motion— Gary Illyes (@methode) November 5, 2016 Google won't publish an FAQ on this Google won't be publishing an FAQ on the mobile-first index just yet. They are still too early in the game and want to figure out which direction they go. @BermanHale @dawnieando @jenstar @haahr re: FAQ: we do want to be pretty vocal about this, but I don't want to commit to anything just yet— Gary Illyes (@methode) November 6, 2016 What about pagespeed and specific factors? Previous, well, now, Google looks at the pagespeed and ranking signals of your desktop pages. So a fast desktop page with a canonical slow mobile page, will pick up the desktop factor and be graded as being fast and not slow. This will flip, I think. So if you have a slow desktop page but your mobile page is super fast, Google will use the mobile version of your pagespeed. At least, it looks like all/most those signals will now be based on your mobile page versus your desktop page. .@BermanHale In other words, same as it ever was, just crawling mobile pages instead of desktop pages.— Paul Haahr (@haahr) November 5, 2016 When someone asked Gary if that would cause the same problem that we have now in reverse, Gary said no. He thinks most of the web will be mobile soon anyway: @ItsHogg @PhilJCook with more mobile users than desktop (and aggressively growing), no, I don't think so— Gary Illyes (@methode) November 5, 2016 Mobile ranking factors still the same So the core mobile friendly ranking signals are to be the same. Nothing is changing their. This is independent of that. .@BermanHale Sounds pretty much right to me, but no change in mobile friendly criteria, just visiting as if on mobile device.— Paul Haahr (@haahr) November 6, 2016 Google's official technical recommendations This is a copy paste from their blog post but needs to be here: If you have a responsive site or a dynamic serving site where the primary content and markup is equivalent across mobile and desktop, you shouldn’t have to change anything. If you have a site configuration where the primary content and markup is different across mobile and desktop, you should consider making some changes to your site. Make sure to serve structured markup for both the desktop and mobile version. Sites can verify the equivalence of their structured markup across desktop and mobile by typing the URLs of both versions into the Structured Data Testing Tool and comparing the output. When adding structured data to a mobile site, avoid adding large amounts of markup that isn’t relevant to the specific information content of each document. Use the robots.txt testing tool to verify that your mobile version is accessible to Googlebot. Sites do not have to make changes to their canonical links; we’ll continue to use these links as guides to serve the appropriate results to a user searching on desktop or mobile. If you are a site owner who has only verified their desktop site in Search Console, please add and verify your mobile version. If you only have a desktop site, we'll continue to index your desktop site just fine, even if we're using a mobile user agent to view your site. If you are building a mobile version of your site, keep in mind that a functional desktop-oriented site can be better than a broken or incomplete mobile version of the site. It's better for you to build up your mobile site and launch it when ready.   Find more information on this? With all of this information above, there is still more and more information coming out on this daily. I will, like always, keep you on top of those changes or announcements. You should read the Google blog, Jenny Halasz wrote up a good piece on this as did Jennifer Slegg's piece. So check all of that out as well. Forum discussion at WebmasterWorld and Twitter.

In the end it will all probably become a "Responsive Web" and even now Google's "Make This Page Mobile Friendly" is gently pushing content toward the Responsive Web. Mambo Man 11/07/2016 02:28 pm What a cluster ****! Can't wait to see how this plays out! :) Akash Srivastava 11/07/2016 04:18 pm It's a good decision by Google to create mobile search index and make it primary. I like it. However we need to watch how this goes in coming months. Nate White 11/07/2016 04:23 pm Are you sure they are testing this live? Their announcement said "we’ve begun experiments." That can mean a lot but not necessarily live. Could just be semantics. Can you get some clarification? Barry Schwartz 11/07/2016 04:25 pm Ugh. You see the part about ramping it up. Seem like it is a live experiment now. Nate White 11/07/2016 04:30 pm Yep, but where are we now to ramp up from? Barry Schwartz 11/07/2016 04:33 pm So deep. :) Recovering keyword spammer 11/07/2016 04:47 pm I thought everyone had gone responsive long ago. I can't remember the last time I saw a mobile only site, seems a bit out of date now. Darren Lennox 11/07/2016 05:36 pm We may be caught up in this problem and are working with Ashley @BermanHale (see tweets above) on webmaster forum https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!msg/webmasters/vLKUFwlScqU/YHAJcBEXAwAJ to try and resolve. I'm trying to get this escalated as there seems to be no logical reason why our home page http://www.thebilliardcompany.ie has disappeared. Trying desperately to get it indexed again but Google is refusing to show the home page. Looks like it switched to mobile index a few weeks ago and now we are completely stuck. Anyone got any suggestions here? Barry? I really would appreciate any insight on this or if you could shoot someone a tweet to take a look. Major thanks in advance. Simon 11/07/2016 06:02 pm Had a quick scan through the thread so sorry if this is obvious and you've tried it, but... have you done a Fetch As Google and reindex in GSC on the page you believe to be missing from the index? Simon 11/07/2016 06:10 pm Ah, just seen that you'd already done this and it returned for a while and then disappeared again. Is that correct? Zach Doty 11/07/2016 06:37 pm Anyone notice Gary's geo-stamp moving all around the globe in a few days? :-) Pedro Matias 11/07/2016 07:19 pm Well my two cents, I can say I'm one of the "lucky few" seeing this already. One particular site with the same content but different markup for mobile and desktop, is interestingly jumping a few pages up and down on some queries and the mobile results are different from desktop but fluctuations move in sync (different page - for same query). If that makes sense. Darren Lennox 11/07/2016 07:33 pm Hi Simon, thanks for jumping in on this. Yes that's right. Home page reappeared for a short while then disappeared again. Have been fetching and submitting via GSC daily since then but no joy. Simon 11/07/2016 07:50 pm Cheers. Could you explain *exactly* what happened with the www vs non-www thing, because I can see loads of non-www pages in the index, all with 404s on the cache, even though the pages 301 to the www pages. Which is a sign of flotsam in the index. A Friend 11/07/2016 07:51 pm Im really not liking the way your url is displaying in the serps. I think you should start there to be honest. See screenshot here: http://tinypic.com/r/f19m3s/9 Recovering keyword spammer 11/07/2016 08:15 pm I'm no techie but I noticed something that may be odd going on with a 301 which seems to be forcing a trainling slash on the end of your url.. like: http://thebilliardcompany.ie/ - Afaik you cannot (or not supposed to be able to) force a trailing slash on your root domain, but you have a 301 set up that seems to be doing it. Also there was some reference to 'no cache'. Maybe check that with someone who knows. Recovering keyword spammer 11/07/2016 08:31 pm There's something weird going on with some of your internal links too, see the link to 'contact us' from your homepage. Also you need some correct 301's implementing to forward .php and any other untidy endings to the required canonical clean urls. Only had a brief look but there's a lot of tidying up that appears to need doing on the internal links so would be surprised if your homepage issue is related. Have you recently had some work done on it? Juan Liam Leonardo 11/07/2016 09:30 pm Shows up here. Natalia Witczyk 11/08/2016 09:39 am I have to say it still sounds a bit vague and I'm curious to see if there won't be that many changes, as Google says. But I am very happy with the comms from Google's side. I think it's first time that I feel properly informed from the source before the actual change takes place. Darren Lennox 11/08/2016 09:55 am Thanks. We also noticed this and had been working to fix, set up a 301 in the end. Jimbo 11/08/2016 10:35 am Cheers Geoff PHC Law 11/08/2016 03:39 pm Let's see shall we, there's a lot of waffle and flannel about SEO. Only folk with experience really know what they're doing... sda 11/08/2016 04:21 pm LOL The comms from google are excellent. Almost always wrong or made up Aimee Jurenka 11/08/2016 07:40 pm Will my site be affected if it is mobile friendly? Anthony Tornambe 11/09/2016 05:41 am is there any help in site ranking with this? doorman 11/09/2016 11:06 am who care about this. what is going on with the big google ranking flux (for bed) this days?! the big change after p4 is now eating away. why?? Anon User 11/09/2016 08:26 pm Boring stories for 2 days. Need some better posts for engagement Barry. KleponPink 11/09/2016 10:36 pm This should be a good idea. Looking forward to see how it works! step13 11/10/2016 03:39 am Ugh, this is all happening much faster than I expected it would. Didn't the guys at Google go party after the election results? After that we have Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Years, the U.S. inauguration, Valentine's Day...I mean, they could easily wait till April or May 2017 i would think.. Pasquale Mellone 11/10/2016 10:21 am Interesting development from Google. Thanks for sharing! Jimbob 11/10/2016 11:29 am Ok I understand half the population are in shock and the other half are ecstatic, but why is it so quiet..? Anyone else seeing a huge slowdown in traffic? Saw exactly the same on the day of Brexit. Jerry B. 11/10/2016 12:56 pm Almost makes you miss the "where is penguin" discussions, eh? Nick Ker 11/10/2016 01:00 pm Search volume for things like "how to move to Canada" is way up. Jimbob 11/10/2016 01:33 pm Maybe, but I notice the lefties only like democracy when it goes their way. Same here in the UK with all the remoaners whinging for a second referendum because everyone who voted out was too 'thick' to understand lol. Jerry B. 11/10/2016 01:51 pm You mean like how from day one of the Obama administration the lefties said their job was to make sure nothing got done? Oops - that was the republicans. Then there was that guy who spent years insisting the president was not born here. Democracy is good. Trump here and I assume Brexit there brought many new people into the process for the first time. Unfortunately much of the info on which they based their votes was utterly bogus. It's a lot like the crap info that people believe about SEO - once some people latch onto a belief, they see facts and truth as an attack on them personally and will not give up even the most ridiculous beliefs. For example, my neighbor is certain Clinton personally murdered 47 people with her own hands because some website said it. On the other side, a Muslim coworker is thinking of selling his house now in case he gets deported, based on Trump's own repeated statements, which his own campaign pretended he never said or that he doesn't really intend to do that. An informed electorate is important, but few here seem to want that. Anon User 11/10/2016 02:02 pm Your truth is not necessarily my truth. They all lie, you just have to decide which lies you prefer. This time the electorate preferred Trumps lies over Clintons lies. Next time it will be someone elses lies. Jerry B. 11/10/2016 02:09 pm Agree about lies vs other lies, but truth is truth. That anyone would think truth is flexible based on one's beliefs (ie continued belief of unproven things despite no evidence, while lots of evidence that negates the belief is readily available, aka "willful ignorance") is exactly the problem. Nick Ker 11/10/2016 02:28 pm I didn't mean to trigger any political nonsense, but here is this: “You are entitled to your own opinion. But you are not entitled to your own facts.” ― Daniel Patrick Moynihan Facts can be confusing and seem contradictory if you don't actually look at the facts. Just because some misinterpret or misrepresent them doesn't mean they are not facts. For example, the electorate actually preferred Clinton, so to say the electorate preferred Trump is not true. It is true that more people voted for Clinton than Trump. However, we have the electoral college which basically means some of the electorate's votes are worth more than others, and Trump won based on that. Like it or not, that's how US elections "work". Sometimes we don't get what we really chose. Anon User 11/10/2016 03:09 pm Ah, the evidence. Anecdotal more like. Facts is facts and they are very limited when it comes to SEO. We have politics so why not bring in religion :) There are billions of people in the world that believe God (whichever one you choose) is real and true. Yet it remains unproven. Truth is what you believe to be true. For someone else it might be a lie. It's not as simple as saying truth is truth unless you of course are the one who has laid down exactly what is and is not true and the whole world agrees with it. Jerry B. 11/10/2016 03:18 pm I think you need to look up the definition of truth. You just described opinion. It may surprise you to learn those are two different things. Unless you are trying to say it is true that you are an idiot. That's an easily believed opinion, but if I can make my own truth as you say - I'll go with "anon user is an idiot" as a truth. Anon User 11/10/2016 03:19 pm You actually just branded yourself an idiot. But that's what idiots do I suppose. Jerry B. 11/10/2016 03:29 pm SEO and politics are very similar. Many who practice either have little regard for truth. As I believe you know, some have no grasp whatsoever of the differences between fact, opinion and belief. Anon User 11/10/2016 05:29 pm Oh no, not those. Google have that one well sorted out. SEO's are all over the place with this one. I'm actually enjoying the chaos. M Webster 11/10/2016 06:46 pm Which SEOs are all over what place? Nobody is talking about Penguin at all anymore except people who are imagining that they have a penguin penalty. Anon User 11/10/2016 07:27 pm How many people are imagining they have a penguin penalty? How would you even know that? Fuck you SEO's are always making shit up. Jimbob 11/10/2016 09:40 pm Anyone else noticing some old shocker sites surfacing in their niche. Just seen one where about 80% of the text was an image!!! (and a really bad one at that). It looked like something out of the 1980's!! Hilarious. Has rankbrain gone rogue!? M Webster 11/10/2016 09:49 pm Since there is no penguin penalty, all those who think they have a penguin penalty are wrong. I haven't seen anyone claim to have a penguin penalty lately so that number may in fact be zero. Which SEOs are "all over the place" about penguin? Surely you were not making things up when you said that. Joe Nobody 11/10/2016 09:58 pm Don't confuse him with the facts. If he wants to believe 59 is higher than 60, that's his choice even if it isn't true. Anon User 11/10/2016 10:27 pm I reckon SEO's are getting dumped en masse. The SEO industry as we knew it is no more. Sure people like you will desperately hang on to the fools you have left but the new SEO is called MARKETING!!!!! Have you heard of MARKETING????? And now all the SEO's will say we are marketing experts, that's what we have always done. LOL. Thank fuck real marketing is back. Thank FUCK! SEO guru no more 11/11/2016 07:43 am "The SEO industry as we knew it is no more" I think you may well be right about that. Far too many variables, too much fluctuation, no one has a clue what's going on. All we can do is abide by the webmaster guidelines and hope for the best. Total win for Google. Jacob 11/11/2016 11:45 am see at this moment big rank flux. anyone else see it? Asaf Dok 11/11/2016 01:00 pm Yes, seeing ranking changes and fluctuations in my Niche (laws). Winston 11/11/2016 02:41 pm That guy does nothing but make sh*t up. Marek P 11/12/2016 02:29 am Same here, big ranking fluctuations almost the same when the launched Penguin 4.0 For sure there is something going on. TomCru 11/12/2016 08:10 am please don't again! google make a return and now ranking very similar before they launched Penguin 4.0. google i hate you! Mark 11/12/2016 09:30 am we are going to clear some doubts about how SEO works, without any robotic language. http://www.bloghashtag.com/learn-everything-about-seo/ Anon User 11/12/2016 03:36 pm Ohh. I love to read pidgeon English. This is SEO from the 1990s written by an Indian with almost a legible grasp of English. This write up is for highly experienced SEO's only to marvel at the lack of knowledge. Business owners or new to SEO should avoid at all costs. Cuthbert 11/12/2016 05:25 pm Indians SEO's love signing their spam emails off with English names. Can one of you Indian SEO's tell me why that is? timaiday 11/12/2016 06:24 pm wrong! each electoral college vote is the same. The winner in a state takes all e-c votes. Total 538 e-c votes. Each state has a number of e-c votes base on the state population. Clinton got more popular votes in blue states, way too much. Bottom line is she lost many states therefore she lost. Popular votes favor states with large population(ca,ny) leaves small states without any voice. Nick Ker 11/12/2016 06:36 pm Thank you for the irrelevant lesson on what the EC is. Now here's the definition of "electorate" which is what Anon said Trump won the most of, and is what I was talking about: "all the people in a country or area who are entitled to vote in an election". The electorate is just what the definition says: "all", not "segmented by state". https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/a21d13f0d57a0b4cb0a9171cc81b071cc7287f463efda92ba698da6253d460d1.jpg I think Anon is not from the US and didn't know that we don't base our presidential election outcome on the popular vote, and it sometimes does not match the EC numbers. My point was that what he said was actually not true and a good example of a belief being mistaken for a fact. James 11/12/2016 06:56 pm People who voted for Brexit and Trump don't care about 'facts'. It's more about throwing a f****** nuclear bomb into the laps of the liberal leftie global corporate mass immigration loving brainwashing machine that have been screwing us for the last 20 years, I think you'll find. Which is why the MSM are just pissing in the wind with their futile attempts at swaying the vote. The old tricks just don't work anymore. What happens from here is anyone's guess. timaiday 11/12/2016 09:03 pm He said they lie. That is correct. the other area he's not correct and u r not correct either. there is no such "some of the electorate's votes are worth more than others". That is dead wrong. Nick Ker 11/12/2016 11:30 pm The issue I raised was the use of the word electorate and saying that more of the electorate voted for the candidate who won when that was not actually the case. I already explained that to you. I wrote the damned comment so I am sure I know what I meant better than you would. As far as some worth more than others, I live in Pennsylvania where we carry 20 electoral college votes. You can be damn sure candidates value my vote more than someone in a state which has just a few EC votes. Why? Because they want the state's high number of EC votes. Because of Pennsylvania's 20 EC votes, my individual vote is essentially worth twice as much as a vote from a person in say Maryland where they have 10 EC votes. I'm not saying it is right or wrong, just how it is. blog comments powered by Disqus The pulse of the search community Subscribe Subscribe options ADVERTISERS Search buzz Video 11/11/2016 08:39 am Subscribe More videos Video Details Browse by: Browse by Date Find by Category Discover by Author Scan Most Recent See Comments View Tag Cloud SEM FORUM THREADS WebmasterWorld Forums Best Practices for Indexable Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) Facebook Messenger 1.3 Now Allows Sponsored Messages Digital Point Forums nginx: [emerg] unexpected "}" in conf Introduction Sponsored links Best SEO Company Link Penalty Recovery £200 includes locating & contacting Submit a Thread Forum Search Awards About Us Seals Advertise Contact Full Site The content at the Search Engine Roundtable are the sole opinion of the authors and in no way reflect views of RustyBrick ®, Inc Copyright © 1994-2016 RustyBrick ®, Inc.

As the biggest ride-hailing app in the U.S., Uber [Direct Link] recently announced that starting tomorrow an action sheet will pop up when users launch the app, reminding them to vote. Through a partnership with Google, the prompt will also include a way for users to find their polling place, add it as a destination, and use Uber to make it to the polls. Uber said that the small update was implemented because the company wants "to make getting to and from your polling place easier than ever." As a blanket rule, polls open 6AM and close at 8PM. Let Uber and Google help you get out to vote. As part of our ongoing campaign to encourage users to vote, Uber is teaming up with Google to launch a special in-app feature on November 8th that will help you locate your polling location and then seamlessly request a ride with just a push of a button. Given the important decision people around the country will make on November 8th, we wanted to make getting to and from your polling place easier than ever. Teaming up with Google, Uber is excited to help make that trip as convenient and stress free as possible. Another popular taxiing app, Lyft [Direct Link], is angling its Election Day promotion as more of a money-saver for its customers (via The Verge). In twenty select markets, Lyft riders will be able to get a 45 percent discount on one ride between 7AM and 8PM tomorrow, although the return trip does not receive a similar discount. Lyft's promotion is limited to the following cities: Atlanta, Baltimore, Boston, Charlotte, Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Detroit, Miami, Minneapolis-St. Paul, Nashville, New Orleans, New York City and New Jersey, Orange County, Philadelphia, Phoenix, Portland, Raleigh, San Diego, and Washington. Eligible customers in these cities can check their inbox for a promotional email from Lyft and take advantage of the 45 percent discount in the Deals of the Week section of the app. Car-sharing company Zipcar [Direct Link] is offering 7,000 of its vehicles completely free of charge on Election Day to customers riding to the polls. Of course, limitations apply, including the fact that a free Zipcar can only be taken between the limiting, last-minute window of 6PM and 10PM on the night of November 8. Users can reserve a Zipcar now, although supplies of the 7,000 rides available are likely to be limited. Note: Due to the political nature of the discussion regarding this topic, the discussion thread is located in our Politics, Religion, Social Issues forum. All forum members and site visitors are welcome to read and follow the thread, but posting is limited to forum members with at least 100 posts.

November is also the best time to buy a new smartphone, with retailers slashing prices in the run up to Black Friday. The Google Pixel replaces last year's Nexus 5X, and is the smaller offering that comes with 32GB or 128GB storage, a 5-inch 1080p display, 4GB of RAM, 12 megapixel camera and a whole lot more. Meanwhile, the Google Pixel XL takes the place of the Nexus 6P as the larger, more premium, smartphone from Google. It comes with a 5.5-inch 2K resolution screen, 4GB of RAM and the same cameras as the smaller Pixel, all housed in a stunning metal body. We're listing the best Google Pixel deals right here so you can always find the cheapest prices! If you choose a Google Pixel or Google Pixel XL deal from Mobiles.co.uk then enter in the code 10OFF before you buy to get a further £10 off.   More options: iPhone 7 deals | iPhone 7 Plus deals | Samsung Galaxy Note 7 deals | SIM-only deals The UK's best Google Pixel deals: At the top of our guide you'll see what we've chosen as this month's best value Google Pixel deals. Underneath that you'll see what we think are the best Google Pixel XL deals. These are all chosen purely on the basis of value - unlike some other sites we don't manipulate the order of these deals for commercial gain! Underneath the top deals section you'll see what we've chosen to be the best Google Pixel deals for each of the four major networks, those being EE, O2, Three and Vodafone. Google Pixel 32GB | £129.99 phone | 600 mins | 5000 texts | 1GB data | £37.50pm ID isn't offering any Google Pixel deals without an upfront cost, and sadly its cap on minutes and texts remains, whereas its competitors mainly offer unlimited talk time and as many texts as your thumb can handle. Still, this isn't a terrible deal, as the monthly payments aren't too high at £37.50. The 600 minutes of talk time may be enough for those of you who don't like chatting on the phone too long. The total 24 month cost on this deal is £1029.99 Get this deal: Carphone Warehouse The UK's best Google Pixel XL deals: You've reached the bit where we round up all of this month's best Google Pixel XL deals. This is the slightly better/bigger version of the Pixel. These are all chosen purely on the basis of value - unlike some other sites we don't manipulate the order of these deals for commercial gain! Underneath the top deals section you'll see what we've chosen to be the best Google Pixel deals for each of the four major networks, those being EE, O2, Three and Vodafone. Google Pixel XL 32GB | £209.99 phone | Unlimited mins | Unlimited texts | 1GB data | £33pm If you're after a Google Pixel XL deal from O2, then be prepared to pay quite a bit upfront. This deal asks you to part with £209.99 upfront, but the upshot is that monthly payments are just £33. So a little pain to begin with for a much easier monthly payment scheme may be the way to go.  The total 24 month cost on this deal is £1001.99 Get this deal: from Carphone Warehouse Now let's break down the best Google Pixel and Pixel XL deals by network... Best Google Pixel and Pixel XL deals on EE The place to go if you want high-speed 4G Google Pixel 32GB | £79.99 phone | Unlimited mins | Unlimited texts | 3GB data | £45.99pm If you want a Google Pixel on EE this month, then you need to pay upfront. This deal gives you the handset for £79.99, which isn't too bad for such a quality smartphone, and you get 3GB of 4G data and unlimited minutes and texts as well. The total 24 month cost on this deal is £1183.75 Get this deal: from Carphone Warehouse Google Pixel 32GB | £99 phone | Unlimited mins | Unlimited texts | 7GB data | £45.99pm Desperate for a Google Pixel deal on EE that gives you oodles of 4G internet and unlimited minutes and calls? Then look no further, as this is a great deal if you rely on using your smartphone to access the internet when out and about. The upfront cost is £99, which keeps the monthly payments at a reasonable £45.99. This is a great deal to get Google's latest handset. The total 24 month cost on this deal is £1202.76 Get this deal: from Carphone Warehouse Google Pixel XL 32GB | £79.99 phone | Unlimited mins | Unlimited texts | 5GB data | £50.99pm If you're after a Google Pixel XL deal from EE, then you're going to have to pay upfront, as there are no offers that give you the handset free. You're also going to get lots of 4G data each month, which is good news for those of you who love streaming movies and music to your handsets, and this deal with a whopping 10GB of data offers the lowest price for entry. The total 24 month cost on this deal is £1303.75 Get this deal: from Carphone Warehouse Google Pixel XL 32GB | £89.99 phone | Unlimited mins | Unlimited texts | 20GB data | £55.99pm This is a good Google Pixel XL deal if you want bags of data without a big upfront cost. You need to pay £89.99 upfront, which is decent considering that this is a brand new flagship smartphone, but you then have the rather high monthly cost of £55.99. This gets you unlimited minutes and texts and a huge 20GB of data each month as well. The total 24 month cost on this deal is £1433.75 Get this deal: Carphone Warehouse Best Google Pixel and Google Pixel XL deals from Vodafone  Offers extras like Spotify and Sky Sports Google Pixel 32GB | Free phone | Unlimited mins | Unlimited texts | 1GB data | £47pm Vodafone has now started to offer Google Pixel contracts, and this one is pretty great. Unlike the deals from many other networks, you don't need to pay upfront for the handset, and you get 1GB of 4G data and unlimited calls and texts every month. If you want to get your hands on the Google Pixel without parting with any cash upfront, this is a deal worth considering. The total 24 month cost on this deal is £1128 Get this deal: from Carphone Warehouse Google Pixel 32GB | £79.99 phone | Unlimited mins | Unlimited texts | 6GB data | £42pm   This is another excellent Google Pixel deal from Vodafone. This time you have to part with £79.99 upfront, but that's not too bad considering the monthly costs drop to £42 and you get a huge boost to your 4G data allowance - getting 6GB every month. That should be plenty for most people. Unlimited minutes and texts also come with this offer. The total 24 month cost on this deal is £1087.99 Get this deal: from Carphone Warehouse Google Pixel XL 32GB | Free phone | Unlimited mins | Unlimited texts | 12GB data | £62pm Vodafone is also bucking the trend with Pixel XL deals, as it's offering a chance to get the new phablet with no upfront cost, unlike many of its rivals. There is a catch, though, as the monthly costs are pretty high at £62. You do get unlimited minutes and texts, as well as an incredible 12GB of 4G data each month, so if you want a free Google Pixel XL with plenty of data, that high monthly cost may be worth investing in. The total 24 month cost on this deal is £1488 Get this deal: from Carphone Warehouse Google Pixel XL 32GB | £79.99 phone | Unlimited mins | Unlimited texts | 1GB data | £47pm If you want a Google Pixel XL on Vodafone for a more manageable monthly cost, then you'll need to pay £79.99 upfront. This drops the monthly asking price to £47, though you also get a reduction in 4G data, with just 1GB of mobile internet each month. If you're not too bothered about checking Facebook or browsing the web, then this trade off should be well worth it. The total 24 month cost on this deal is £1207.99 Get this deal: from Carphone Warehouse Best Google Pixel and Google Pixel XL deals from O2 The network with extras like O2 Priority  Google Pixel 32GB | £49.99 phone | Unlimited mins | Unlimited texts | 1GB data | £43pm   If you want a Google Pixel on O2 then you'll need to pay upfront. Luckily, this deal doesn't ask for too much money, with the upfront cost just £49.99, which isn't too bad for just a recent smartphone. For this you get a monthly cost of £43, unlimited calls, unlimited texts and 1GB of 4G data each month, which isn't too shabby for the price. The total 24 month cost on this deal is £1081.99 Get this deal: from Carphone Warehouse Google Pixel 32GB | £99.99 phone | Unlimited mins | Unlimited texts | 3GB data | £39.50pm This Google Pixel deal sees you paying more upfront, but in return you get a cheaper monthly cost and the 4G data allowance gets boosted to 3GB. That's enough for most people who like to browse the internet and check Facebook and Twitter while out and about. The total 24 month cost on this deal is £1047.99 Get this deal: from Carphone Warehouse Google Pixel XL 32GB | £209.99 phone | Unlimited mins | Unlimited texts | 1GB data | £33pm If you're after a Google Pixel XL deal from O2, then be prepared to pay quite a bit upfront. This deal asks you to part with £209.99 upfront, but the upshot is that monthly payments are just £33. So a little pain to begin with for a much easier monthly payment scheme may be the way to go.  The total 24 month cost on this deal is £1001.99 Get this deal: from Carphone Warehouse Google Pixel XL 32GB | £279.99 phone | Unlimited mins | Unlimited texts | 3GB data | £31.50pm This is another Google Pixel XL deal with a high upfront cost. This time it's £279.99, but the monthly payments drop further to £31.50. This deal gives you unlimited minutes and texts, along with a decent 3GB of 4G data each month, so if you want to watch Netflix on that lovely big screen, this deal is worth considering.  The total 24 month cost on this deal is £1035.99 Get this deal: from Carphone Warehouse Best Google Pixel and Google Pixel XL deals from iD The in-house network from Carphone Warehouse Google Pixel 32GB | £129.99 phone | 600 mins | 5000 texts | 1GB data | £37.50pm ID isn't offering any Google Pixel deals without an upfront cost, and sadly its cap on minutes and texts remains, whereas its competitors mainly offer unlimited talk time and as many texts as your thumb can handle. Still, this isn't a terrible deal, as the monthly payments aren't too high at £37.50. The 600 minutes of talk time may be enough for those of you who don't like chatting on the phone too long. The total 24 month cost on this deal is £1029.99 Get this deal: Carphone Warehouse Google Pixel 32GB | £139.99 phone | 2000 mins | 5000 texts | 2GB data | £43.50pm This Google Pixel deal is a bit more generous with its allowances, giving you 2000 minutes of talk time and 2GB of data each month. This is a better deal for people who like to have a natter and check out what's happening on Facebook without spending too much each month. The upfront cost remains, but at £139.99, it's not too bad considering how new the handset is. The total 24 month cost on this deal is £1183.99 Get this deal: Carphone Warehouse Google Pixel XL 32GB | £179.99 phone | 600 mins | 5000 texts | 1GB data | £37.50pm This is another Google Pixel XL deal that is a bit stingy on allowances from ID. You get just 600 minutes of talk time each month, and 5000 texts, while 4G data is just 1GB. If you're careful with your usage then this may not be a problem, and the monthly payments aren't too bad at £37.50, though you'll need to pay £179.99 upfront to get the handset. The total 24 month cost on this deal is £1079.99 Get this deal: ID Mobile Google Pixel XL 32GB | £179.99 phone | 1200 mins | 5000 texts | 2GB data | £39.50pm This Google Pixel XL deal is more like it, with talk time upped to 1200 minutes, and the 4G data allowance being doubled to 2GB. You still need to pay an upfront cost for the new handset, but the £39.50 monthly cost remains low. Worth considering if you want the Google Pixel XL without paying too much each momth.

This time the biggest finding is just how easy this thing is to repair, getting a score of 8 out of 10 — which is notably better than most smartphones these days. On the downside, the teardown notes that the capacitive touch and LED board at the top of the device is attached with some serious adhesive which was a pain to get off. The DC-in port is also soldered directly to the motherboard, but iFixit notes that this shouldn’t be a part that often needs replacing as the device is made to be always plugged in. But the Google Home wins its 8 out of 10 score because there are almost no moving parts (which in theory should mean fewer points of failure). There are only standard screws and connectors — so you won’t need any special tools in that regard — and perhaps most importantly, many of the components within are modular and can be replaced individually. Interestingly, iFixit also notes that the device shares a few chips with last year’s Chromecast. Inside the Google Home, you’ll find the exact same CPU, flash, and RAM modules. That’s not surprising considering the device is basically a Chromecast with a room-filling speaker attached, but it’s interesting to see just how similar it is to last year’s $35 dongle. You can check out the full teardown over at iFixit.

However, early owners are unable to enter VR due to several missing apps. Google VR Services has just hit the Play Store and is one part closer to enabling the complete Daydream experience. Similar to Play Services, Google VR Services “provides virtual reality functionality for Daydream and Cardboard apps.” Specifically, it controls pairing headsets and controllers, entering and exiting VR apps, and displaying other app notifications while in VR. Of course, Google notes that many Daydream apps will not work if Google VR Services is uninstalled. A screenshot with the Play Store listing shows a panel similar to Quick Settings on Android to control Wi-Fi, volume, location, and more. It also displays the time and date, signal strength, and battery percentage. However, the Daydream experience likely requires another app to fully work judging from the documentation that comes with Daydream View. VR Services just contains the necessary frameworks to support other apps. Several weeks ago, the Daydream Keyboard was also uploaded to the Play Store and serves as the typing experience in VR. The Pixel and Pixel XL already have an older version of VR Services installed and many are receiving the 6.76MB app update this morning. Devices running the Android 7.1.1 Dev Preview like the Nexus 5X and 6P show up as being compatible to download the app. Guides vr View THe Guide Daydream View THe Guide Google VR Services View THe Guide blog comments powered by Disqus Submit a Tip cancel Submitting a tip constitutes permission to publish and syndicate.

Google quietly shutters standalone Google Showtimes movie site Posted Nov 7, 2016 by Ingrid Lunden (@ingridlunden) 0 SHARES Next Story Tesla to charge new owners for Supercharger use after around 1K miles It looks like the last picture show for one of Google’s efforts at expanding into more detailed vertical search pages. Without much notice, the search giant has closed down its standalone movie site where people were able to search for cinemas, films and show times on a particular date and near a specific location, rolling some of the functionality directly into its main search portal. “Google Showtimes”, as the service was called, now brings up a 404 error if you try to visit its main page. The “about” description, however, linked above, provides the following message: “Google Showtimes was discontinued on 1 November 2016. You can now discover show times on the search results page by searching for the name of the movie that you want to see or try searching for the word ‘movies’ to discover what’s in cinemas.” A spokesperson declined to comment further about the closure and whether it was part of one of Google’s recurring spring cleaning (or autumn cleaning, as the case may be) service closures. It’s not clear why Google decided to shut the separate portal but there are some signs that Google Showtimes what not much of a blockbuster for the company, and perhaps even ran counter to how Google sees some of its bigger developments in search and media. Google’s movie portal looks like it first went live in some form in the autumn of 2005, and as you can see from a screenshot from October 2016 below, it never updated much beyond its interface based around Google’s original, very simple, pared-down aesthetics in its original search experience. This was actually a good thing, it seems, as groups of (now former) users on Google’s product forums, Reddit, and elsewhere who are complaining about the closure note the contrast with competing services from the likes of Fandango and Movietickets — which, may look more snappy but are less useful for finding cinemas and films based on specific locations and times that might not be exactly where you are at that precise moment. Those users now appear ready to throw their popcorn at Google for retiring Google Showtimes and funneling some of the features into Google.com, which presents basic results like this when I search for a theater or film here in the UK at Google.com: It looks like Google didn’t do much in the way of selling ads against Showtimes, meaning that the traffic that was resulting from it, such as it was, didn’t necessarily convert to revenue for the company. Google Showtimes somewhat went against bigger trends in the film industry, which is bracing itself for another tough year where cinemas are concerned. Box office ticket sales for 2016 are on track to be the worst in a century, according to Vanity Fair. Google Showtimes also stood separate from the wider industry trend for streaming and Google’s own ambitions to become a platform for distributing and consuming video, coming as it did a full year before the acquisition of YouTube (and many years before services like Android TV). Instead, Google Showtimes appeared to germinate more from the company’s strategy to expand into more vertical search categories, providing landing places for people who are going to the web to look for specific information and choosing specific portals to get there, rather than Google’s catch-all Google.com, a trend that has grown with the rise of smartphone use, where people want fewer steps between looking for something and arriving at an answer. That effort has resulted in the building of an extensive mapping product, Google Maps, but also portals like Google Flights for plane ticket searches and Google Finance for financial news and data. It may be that while Google is still working on new search experiences beyond Google.com, they are more likely to be based around other vertical definitions (like mobile, location, and so on) than Google might have originally conceived. Indeed, Google Showtimes is not the first vertical portal that Google has shut down. Google’s hotel finder now lives within Maps, rather than as a separate site.

After mastering the game of Go, Google's DeepMind is trying its hand at StarCraft. The sci-fi real-time strategy series from Blizzard debuted in 1998, and was followed up in 2010 with StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty. Now, Google and Blizzard have partnered to allow DeepMind's artificial intelligence and machine-learning researchers to use Wings of Liberty as a research playground. "DeepMind is on a scientific mission to push the boundaries of AI, developing programs that can learn to solve any complex problem without needing to be told how," research scientist Oriol Vinyals wrote in a blog post. "Games are the perfect environment in which to do this, allowing us to develop and test smarter, more flexible AI algorithms quickly and efficiently, and also providing instant feedback on how we're doing through scores." The Google subsidiary helped lay the groundwork for the use of games as AI research platforms, including playing 2D Atari games and 3D games such as The Open Racing Car Simulator. Alongside StarCraft research there's also the upcoming DeepMind Labyrinth, which sees AI navigate a Doom-like maze like that shown in the video below: Blizzard's StarCraft, meanwhile, provides what Vinyals calls an "interesting" setting for artificial intelligence exploration "because it provides a useful bridge to the messiness of the real world," he wrote. "The skills required for an agent to progress through the environment and play StarCraft well could ultimately transfer to real-world tasks," the blog post said. //Related Articles DeepMind AI 'Learns' to Navigate London Tube For the uninitiated, StarCraft focuses on three interstellar species, each with their own abilities and gameplay approaches. Players must gather minerals and gas to produce new buildings and units. But each opponent can see only part of the in-game map, forcing players to scout unseen areas, gain information about their competitor, and remember details over a long period of time. Google worked with the StarCraft II team at Blizzard to develop an API (sneak peek in the first video above), and create a "curriculum" of scenarios. "While we're still a long way from being able to challenge a professional human player at the game of StarCraft II, we hope that the work we have done with Blizzard will serve as a useful testing platform for the wider AI research community," Vinyals said.

Try PRLeap Penguin 4.0 - Opace Speaks About the Google Algorithm Update Google Penguin 4.0, changing the shape of SEO November 07, 2016   Business News (PRLEAP.COM) November 7, 2016 - The Internet has been ablaze over the last month or so with SEO industry professionals providing their opinion and commentary about Penguin 4.0. Opace who are an online marketing agency located in Birmingham, discuss the latest Google update, its implications and their findings. Alan Horton at Opace discusses how essential good quality content is to SEO in a post-Penguin world: "All releases of Google Penguin (from V1.0 onwards) have been an integrity check for the SEO industry and clients. Gone are the days when the site buying most links would appear at the top of the rankings. We're now in a climate where "content is King" and businesses need to focus on content production and generate backlinks naturally through creating content that people will want to link to." On 23rd September, 2016, Google announced that Penguin 4.0 had arrived. This was major news for the SEO industry and clients alike who had waited nearly two years since the previous Penguin release V3.0 on 17th October, 2014. Penguin is real-time and core part of Google search functionality The first major feature of the announcement was the fact that Penguin 4.0 is now real-time and Google's Gary Illyes comments: "Penguin is now realtime and part of the core algorithm. It took a while to launch it, but totally worth the wait imo" quoted Google spokesperson Gary Illyes. Many will struggle to agree it's been "worth the wait" as nearly two years is an excessively long time to wait, but undoubtedly moving to real-time is of great benefit. Managing Director at Opace, David Bryan continues: "The time taken for Google to process disavowment requests and remove toxic links has been a real problem at times. The fact that Penguin 4.0 is real-time is a big step forward for SEO professionals as we will complete work and the results should reflect in the rankings much more quickly." The reality is that the algorithm change will be near real-time rather than actual real-time. The algorithm will take effect the next time the website with the backlink is indexed, only then will rankings will be updated accordingly. As explained by Razvan Gavrilas of Cognitive SEO, there will be winners and losers: "Your site will be penalized in near real-time (if you get unnatural links) as well as recover from a penalty incredibly quickly, (if you disavow or remove the bad links)." This view was supported by SEO expert Dr. Peter J. Meyers, of Moz who commented: "Hopefully, if you were impacted by Penguin in the past and have made changes, those changes have been rewarded (or soon will be). The good news is that, now that Penguin is real-time, we shouldn't have to wait another two years for a major refresh." There had been much irritation in the SEO industry and with owners about the delay between Penguin 3.0 and 4.0, this delays seems to have been necessitated because Google needed time to make Penguin core and therefore real-time. Although the delay was regrettable, it's now good news for website owners and SEO practitioners who follow the Google webmaster quality guidelines. Organisations adhering to these guidelines in the future will more than likely rise in future rankings, but the Google search engine is a competitive landscape and top rankings require commitment, skill and investment. Penguin now more granular The second main feature of the Google Penguin 4.0 release is that it is more granular, in Google's central webmaster blog post they said: "Penguin is now more granular. Penguin now devalues spam by adjusting ranking based on spam signals, rather than affecting ranking of the whole site." So what does granular mean exactly? From Penguin V2.0 and onwards Google have punished Sitewide through Google Penguin so it is Opace's opinion that the increased granularity is likely to apply at a more sectional or keyword level. On the topic of increased granularity, Barry Schwartz said on an SEO Roundtable blog post: "Penguin being more "granular" is a bit confusing. I suspect it means that now Penguin can impact sites on a page-by-page basis, as opposed to how it worked in the past where it impacted the whole site. So really spammy pages or spammy sections of your site can solely be impacted by Penguin now, as opposed to your whole web site. That is my guess; I am trying to get clarification on this." Ongoing need to disavow Another topic of discussion has been disavow tool; this is the process of reversing toxic backlinks from the past by disavowing them through a Google tool. Google have confirmed that disavowments will still be necessary post Penguin 4.0, by still using the Google disavow tool, which is a part of the Google Search Console. Google confirmed the ongoing need for the disavow tool through comments online: "OK, clearer: no change on using the disavow file. Use it thoughtfully, as always." said John Mueller, Gary IIIyes commented, "We haven't changed our recommendations for the disavow tool with this launch" Once penalised / always penalised debate Some SEO experts believe with Google Penguin that even with disavow/removal action an algorithm rule of "once penalised, always penalised" applies. Marie Haynes of Marie Haynes Consulting stated in a blog post: "I firmly believe that when a site is hit by Penguin, it's like a weight is put on the site to keep it from ranking at its full potential. I don't think that this has changed significantly with this new iteration of Penguin." "From Opace's perspective, we understand this viewpoint and have failed to see the results we would have expected to see from past removal/disavow exercises, but it's been a full month since Penguin 4.0 began and things seem to be very different now," responds Alan Horton. "It is possible though that with past attempts at removal/disavow backlinks may have been missed from the disavow process due to them not being listed in backlink tools. A bit like a stubborn tree root some toxic backlinks can be difficult to find and identify and Google don't state explicitly which the problem links are. This is why it's so important for organisations to either invest in multiple backlink tools or outsource toxic backlink removal to SEO experts like Opace as we have access to these tools and experience in using them." Results reported by Opace in the month following Penguin 4.0 As with any Google update, there can be a period of uncertainty where fluctuations happen and this certainly appeared to be the case with Penguin 4.0. David Bryan talks about his observations and the experiences that Opace have had post Penguin 4.0: "Penguin 4.0 seemed to hit us a little later here in the UK, with many of the sites that we monitor here at Opace only showing a notable change just prior 6th October. However, it's now been nearly a month since then and during this period we've seen rankings climb (a lot), some have then dropped (a bit), and now they seem to have levelled out and reached a nice plateau." David continues: "Once thing is absolutely certain, that the overall organic visibility for all of our SEO clients has grown enormously since Penguin 4.0. Even those clients who have always ranked well and shown no signs of a penalty have benefited. For example, one of our clients, SPI Lasers, is a global leader in industrial lasers and they have always shown great SEO presence and strong rankings, but since Penguin 4.0 they have shown a massive 24% improvement covering nearly 150 keywords. To put this another way, that's 36 new page 1 keywords ranking on Google.co.uk, 20 new page 1 keywords ranking on Google.com, 7 new position 1 keywords ranking on Google.co.uk. The monthly search volume this equates to is hundreds of thousands. Other clients have shown similar improvements and those that came to us for penalty removal appear to have now recovered and are performing incredibly well, with most returning to pre-penalty status or better." How to recover from a Google Penguin rankings drop The first part of recovery from a drop in rankings caused by Google Penguin, is awareness. Organisations need to have suitably qualified and trained professionals who can advise if Google Penguin is causing the drop in rankings. Wherever necessary professional SEO expertise should be brought in from organisations such as Opace. David explains: "We believe that the successes we have achieved following Penguin 4.0 is down to a number of factors, including industry awareness, knowledge, expertise, access to tools, being pro-active in what we do, but most importantly we've always focussed on quality. Ensuring good quality on-site SEO and content is paramount. Having a purposeful, quality-driven approach to marketing, which includes link building, is also important. Despite what some may say, links do still matter and simply removing toxic links isn't enough. Website owners, marketers and agencies like Opace need to work hard to promote and drive meaningful traffic back to the businesses they represent through high quality links. Less is definitely more, and while links are important for SEO, it's not good to dwell on them or build links for the sake of building links. Don't focus on anchor text and forget about dofollow vs. nofollow. The important thing is relevance and whether those links are placed on authority sites that will drive good quality traffic back." Recovery should be much quicker in future but still takes a well thought out implementation, dedication and commitment to succeed.

It concentrated on outbound links and how and why these affect your site’s ranking. This week, we tackle backlinks. What is a backlink? A backlink is link from a third party website, back to your own. These can also be called ‘inbound’ or ‘incoming’ links. Why are backlinks important? As revealed by Andrey Lipattsev, the Search Quality Senior Strategist at Google Ireland, earlier this year, links pointing to your website are one of the top three Google ranking factors. Backlinks are a vote of confidence that someone outside of your own web property trusts your content and believes it has value. Google weighs up each of these links and assigns the linked-to webpage its own value.

A few high authority links are far more valuable then many from low quality sites. This from our own guide to authority websites: An authority website is a site that is trusted. It’s trusted by its users, trusted by industry experts, trusted by other websites and trusted by search engines. The more good quality links you have the better. 3) An authority website doesn’t necessarily have to be one of the usual big publishers. If you’re a niche website or blog with high quality, relevant content, you can be as highly regarded as any other source. 4) Backlinks from older websites may be worth more than links from newer sites. 5) Backlinks from relevant sites in your niche will be worth significantly more than ones from irrelevant sites or webpages. Some people believe that links from competitors for the same search position as you are worth more than others too. 6) Links from low-quality sites will do very little for your visibility. If the site practices Black Hat SEO (link-schemes, spamming, doorway pages) then can potentially harm your ranking. 7) Links found within the main body text of a webpage is more valuable than links found in separate plugins or widgets found elsewhere on the page. 8) If a site links to you using the ’nofollow’ meta tag then their website’s authority won’t be passed to you. Some publishers automatically nofollow all external links, which is bad practice. Nofollow links should be reserved for sponsored or paid for links and content you don’t necessarily trust but still want to use as an example. 9) Links from a diverse range of websites is good, many links from a single domain to your site (especially if it’s one of the very sites linking to you) can be seen as spammy. 10) Despite previous assumptions, a link from a 301 redirected page shouldn’t lose any PageRank compared to a link from a non-301 redirected page. 11) Anchor text can affect how Google weighs up links to your site. If linking to your homepage and referring to your brand, anchor text should just say your website or brand name. Links to your homepage that are more descriptive “leading experts in local SEO” can be seen as manipulative, so you want to avoid this. 12) Anchor text to specific webpages on your site should be descriptive (but concise) as possible in order to benefit from the link. 13) Links at the top of a page carry more weight than those further down. 14) Links from longer form, evergreen content (a 1,000+ word article that’s been popular for a long time) will be higher value than short, news-based posts. 15) Although the top-level domain isn’t necessarily considered a factor, some people believe obtaining a link from .edu or .gov domains can carry more weight than others. This may be because these sorts of websites have high authority anyway.

Home Entertainment BellaNaija Ladun Liadi Linda Ikeji Nigerian Newspapers Daily Times Guardian Newspaper National Mirror Punch Newspaper The Nation Newspaper Nigerian Pilot Newspaper Vanguard Newspaper Nigeria News PM News Premium Times TV Stations Channels TV Lagos Television TVC News TV Continental Videos Music Videos Notjustok Tooxclusive News Videos YOHAIG Think YOruba HAusa IGbo Google prepares African youths for future online jobs Posted November 7, 2016 2:56 pm by admin Comments A Google executive, Ms Bunmi Banjo, on Monday said that there was need for the refocusing of African youths, to prepare them for online jobs that would be available in future. Banjo, who is the Head, Digital Education, Google Sub-Saharan Africa, told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Lagos that the digital era in which the world was in meant future jobs would be online. She said African youths needed to be able to tap into these growing online opportunities, so they would not be stranded. “In view of this fact, Google is poised to bridge the big gap between youths and online future jobs. “In the job market, there is a big gap between future jobs that is jobs that are going to be available in the near future and the preparedness of young people to fill such positions. “In order to fill this existing gap, Google introduced a portal called digitalskills.go.com. “The idea is to train young people. We will show them what is possible with the web and how they can earn income through it and help their communities,’’ the Google executive said. Banjo said under the training scheme, it would train a million youths from 23 countries. According to her, the programme which started in April, was yielding great results as 500,000 youths had already been trained between the commencement date and September. “We have met half of our target; we need another six months, which will end in March to train the remaining 500,000 youths with the help of our partners. “Out of these figure, 400,000 youths are to come from Nigeria. “The programme involves six hours of content, 89 videos, with an option to choose either the business training or for young people. The training is also in three languages: English, French and Portuguese.’’ According to her, the idea is not charity, even though the training is free. Banjo said the benefit to Google was in having a thriving digital economy in Nigeria, in particular and Africa, in general. She added that the focus was also on youth employment and empowerment “If the digital economy is strong and growing, obviously Google as a digital business will also flourish in the environment. “It does not make sense to be in an environment with so many challenges that potentially affects one’s business and not try to deal with them. “With the right environment, digital business will thrive with online advertisements, young people getting jobs digitally, earning money and it will trickle down on us too,’’ the Google executive said. She explained that local trainers, who understood the communities, were being used for the training, adding that they translated the curriculum to their local classroom. According to Banjo, the organisation will carry out an impact study to track and monitor the progress of the participants after the training. “We have witnessed tremendous success so far. “An example is that of a lady that got a job within two days of starting the training. “There is another success story of a business in Kenya that experienced 60 per cent growth within months. “A group of women also opened a WhatsApp group to encourage themselves technology-wise in their businesses. “We are hopeful that in 2017, we will witness positive growth as people trained will have the benefit of getting jobs, opening businesses, hopefully on a large scale,’’ Banjo added. She said the participants would not be hindered by network during and after the training as materials would be loaded on audio files. “Audio files can load much faster and take smaller space with a lot less data required, and that is the way we are going,’’ she added.

As such, it doesn’t exactly come as a surprise that the new Galaxy S8 set to debut next year may be released later than expected. For the past three years, Samsung has unveiled a new Galaxy S flagship smartphone in late February ahead of the annual Mobile World Congress trade show. This year, however, a reputable report claims that the new Galaxy S8 smartphone lineup might not be unveiled until April. DON’T MISS: We finally figured out why Google’s Pixel looks so much like an iPhone With the Galaxy Note 7 having been discontinued following a failed global recall stemming from spontaneous fires, Samsung is trying to refocus attention by talking up its upcoming new Galaxy S8 well ahead of schedule. In fact, the company already confirmed one of the new Galaxy S8’s key features early on Monday morning. In line with recent rumors, Samsung said that its next-generation flagship phone will ship with a new personal assistant feature to rival Google Assistant, Siri and Amazon’s Alexa service. Samsung’s version of an intelligent personal assistant will be based on Viv, a technology it acquired recently that was built by one of Siri’s co-founders. Now, according to a new report from The Wall Street Journal, the new artificial intelligence-based assistant feature on the Galaxy S8 might be so prominent that it will be accessible at all times using a dedicated button. “The latest internal prototypes of the premium Galaxy S8 handset include a button on the side edge of the smartphone that would be used to launch a beefed-up virtual assistant,” the paper’s Eun-Young Jeong and Jonathan Cheng reported, noting that the phone’s design hasn’t yet been finalized so the button could be removed. That’s the good news. The bad news is that according to the WSJ’s report, Samsung might not even unveil its new Galaxy S8 until sometime in April. If Samsung stays true to form and keeps some space between the new phone’s unveiling and its release, that could mean Android fans have an additional two months to wait before the new Galaxy S8 finally hits store shelves.

The “fresh new look” includes sleeker transitions that result in Gmail suddenly feeling way more like a proper app and less like a clumsy overlay for Gmail’s mobile website. For one, swiping to archive or delete messages (depending on your preference) now feels as smooth and dependable as it does on Android. Google has also brought over one big feature from Inbox: Undo Send. This new option slides up from the bottom after you’ve fired off an email, giving you a brief opportunity to take it back before all your typos are seen and ridiculed by co-workers. Search has gotten quicker with what Google calls “instant” results and spelling suggestions. The updated Gmail app for iPhone and iPad Unfortunately, this new Gmail refresh still doesn’t include a unified inbox, so you’ve got to switch between personal and work accounts and view them individually. That alone means I’ll probably be sticking with other email apps for the time being. But if you’ve been using the Gmail app for all this time, well, that experience is getting noticeably better today. Google Calendar for iPhone is also being updated today with month view and week in landscape view — plus Spotlight search for finding your appointments, reminders, and goals. Sadly there’s still no iPad version of Google Calendar, so you’ll need another option for keeping up to date with your own life on Apple’s tablet.

Now that Home is shipping to customers, iFixit has released an official teardown confirming the hardware is basically ripped from the 2015 Chromecast. Notably, the Home’s processor, flash memory, and RAM are the exact same chips found in the second-generation Chromecast, but with an audio amplifier thrown in for obvious reasons. It’s not a huge surprise that Google’s done this. As Dieter Bohn has noted before, at the core, the Chromecast was built to send and receive information from the cloud, so it makes sense that the same hardware components would be used on the Home. All Google had to do was make the Home more conversational than its streaming dongle. The Google Home received a positive review from iFixit, scoring an 8 out of 10 for simple, modular pieces that could be easily replaced. If you tried hard enough it looks like you could potentially put a new case on to make it look less like an air freshener, but have a look at the full teardown here and judge for yourself whether it’s worth the effort.

On Sunday, Samsung announced it would include a new AI assistant with its forthcoming Galaxy S8, and that it would combine conversational language and integration with third-party services to perform tasks, dictate messages, and respond to queries on demand. And now, it appears to have a name: Bixby. Samsung filed a trademark in South Korea for “Bixby” in October, for a “computer software for personal information management” — more specifically, “computer application software for smartphones, mobile telephones, portable computers and tablet computers … used to operate voice recognition system[s] … [and enable] hands-free use of a mobile phone through voice recognition.” That description, albeit vague, would appear to fit intelligent assistants of the sort featured in Google’s Android operating system, Apple’s iOS, Microsoft’s Windows Phone, and Amazon’s Echo speakers. Related: Samsung is buying the new AI assistant from the masterminds behind Siri In October, Samsung acquired Viv, an artificial intelligence startup founded by Dag Kittlaus, Chris Brigham, Adam Cheyer, and much of the same engineering team responsible for Apple’s Siri. Viv, the details of which were never revealed publicly, was said to offer a platform which enabled third-party developers to tap into its capabilities. All the more impressive, it reportedly provided a framework for natural language-based interfaces in apps and services — i.e., voice-navigated menus and custom commands. “The deal showcases Samsung’s commitment to virtual personal assistants,” Injong Rhee, CTO of Samsung’s Mobile Communications business, said in a press release following the acquisition. “Viv was built with both consumers and developers in mind. This dual focus is also what attracted us to Viv as an ideal candidate to integrate with Samsung home appliances, wearables, and more, as the paradigm of how we interact with technology shifts to intelligent interfaces and voice control.” Related: Samsung’s Note 7 woes hurt its bottom line, but things are looking up An artificially intelligent assistant isn’t the Galaxy S8’s only reported highlight. Samsung’s upcoming flagship, which is expected to debut at Mobile World Congress in February, improves upon its predecessor’s hardware in significant ways. It’s rumored to ship in two variants, one with a 5.1-inch 2K (2,048 by 1,080 pixels) Super AMOLED display and another with a 5.5-inch 4K (2,096 by 2,160 pixels) screen. Under the hood, both will reportedly pack cutting-edge silicon in the form of either Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 830 processor or Samsung’s Exynos 8895. And both are expected to pack a dual-camera system, potentially called “LightUp Camera” or “Light+ Camera,” that pairs a 16-megapixel camera sensor with a companion 8-megapixel module for the purpose of improving low-light performance. Samsung is counting on the new device being a blockbuster hit. On Wednesday, Samsung reported revenue of $42 billion and profit $4.6 billion year-over-year declines respectively. Its mobile division was the hardest hit: revenue dipped to $87.9 million, down 96 percent year-over-year and the lowest in eight years. Not surprisingly, the firm attributed a majority of those losses to the launch of the Galaxy Note 7, which the company later recalled as a result of well-publicized defects that caused some units to spontaneously explode.

 Google made it incredibly easy to figure out where you should go to vote on Election Day Avery Hartmans Nov. 8, 2016, 9:06 AM 60,536 facebook linkedin twitter email print If you haven't yet figured out where your polling place is on Election Day — which is Tuesday, November 8 — Google can help you find it. There are three easy ways to find this information through Google. You can either visit Google.com and click a button on the bottom-right corner, or click on the day's Google Doodle, which will lead you to the same result. Google You can also type this question into a Google search bar: "Where do I vote?" Doing any of these three things will pull up a box that lets you enter your street address to find your polling location. Google Once you type it in, Google will pull up the polling place in your neighborhood, complete with a map to that address, the hours it's open, and a helpful reminder that Tuesday is Election Day. Google Google will also tell you what to bring with you to vote and show you who is on this year's ballot. And while it's a bit late for this election, Google will also show you how to register to vote in time for the next one.

This isn’t an acquisition per se, but rather just a couple guys who have decided to ditch their own project and move to the Mountain View company to work on bigger things… “Today, we’re excited to announce the next phase of our journey — we are joining Google,” wrote the founders of LeapDroid Huan Ren and Huihong Luo. “While it’s too soon to comment on specific plans, we look forward to working with our new colleagues at Google to continue pushing the frontier of technology.” So what’s going to happen with LeapDroid? According to the developers, it’s pretty much dead. They don’t plan to keep working on it, and current users aren’t going to get any support going forward. And this isn’t an acquisition, so LeapDroid isn’t affiliated with Google. Here’s the word, straight from the LeapDroid website: We have decided to discontinue the development of LeapDroid emulator as we focus on our next adventure at Google.

Banjo, who is the Head, Digital Education, Google Sub-Saharan Africa, told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Lagos that the digital era in which the world was in meant future jobs would be online. She said African youths needed to be able to tap into these growing online opportunities, so they would not be stranded. “In view of this fact, Google is poised to bridge the big gap between youths and online future jobs. “In the job market, there is a big gap between future jobs that is jobs that are going to be available in the near future and the preparedness of young people to fill such positions. “In order to fill this existing gap, Google introduced a portal called digitalskills.go.com. “The idea is to train young people. We will show them what is possible with the web and how they can earn income through it and help their communities,’’ the Google executive said. Banjo said under the training scheme, it would train a million youths from 23 countries. According to her, the programme which started in April, was yielding great results as 500,000 youths had already been trained between the commencement date and September. “We have met half of our target; we need another six months, which will end in March to train the remaining 500,000 youths with the help of our partners. “Out of these figure, 400,000 youths are to come from Nigeria. “The programme involves six hours of content, 89 videos, with an option to choose either the business training or for young people. The training is also in three languages: English, French and Portuguese.’’ According to her, the idea is not charity, even though the training is free. Banjo said the benefit to Google was in having a thriving digital economy in Nigeria, in particular and Africa, in general. She added that the focus was also on youth employment and empowerment “If the digital economy is strong and growing, obviously Google as a digital business will also flourish in the environment. “It does not make sense to be in an environment with so many challenges that potentially affects one’s business and not try to deal with them. “With the right environment, digital business will thrive with online advertisements, young people getting jobs digitally, earning money and it will trickle down on us too,’’ the Google executive said. She explained that local trainers, who understood the communities, were being used for the training, adding that they translated the curriculum to their local classroom. According to Banjo, the organisation will carry out an impact study to track and monitor the progress of the participants after the training. “We have witnessed tremendous success so far. “An example is that of a lady that got a job within two days of starting the training. “There is another success story of a business in Kenya that experienced 60 per cent growth within months. “A group of women also opened a WhatsApp group to encourage themselves technology-wise in their businesses. “We are hopeful that in 2017, we will witness positive growth as people trained will have the benefit of getting jobs, opening businesses, hopefully on a large scale,’’ Banjo added. She said the participants would not be hindered by network during and after the training as materials would be loaded on audio files. “Audio files can load much faster and take smaller space with a lot less data required, and that is the way we are going,’’ she added.

International Business Times, India Edition International Business Times, India Edition India US Election World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Auto Photos Video Search Search Home Technology Google's DeepMind to use Blizzard's StarCraft II to further its AI research Google and Blizzard will build an open research environment to be used by anyone across the globe as of 2017, as well as by DeepMind itself IBTimes Staff Reporter November 7, 2016 19:17 IST A still from StarCraft IIBlizzard They say gaming is good for you, and in  some cases it may well be. But it's highly unlikely that the developers at Blizzard ever thought that the StarCraft II videogame would one day be used by one of the world's foremost Artificial Intelligence companies to help them with their R&D. Google's DeepMind has announced that it will be making use of game development studio Blizzard's StarCraft II game as a testing platform for artificial intelligence (AI) and machine-learning research, opening the environment worldwide. Why advertise with us? Related Rumours suggest announcement of Diablo 4 at Blizzcon 2016 Gamescom 2016: New trailers for 'FIFA 17' and others, poster pranks and more The announcement, made during Blizzard's BlizzCon conference at Anahaim on Sunday, has seen both companies build an open research environment to be used by anyone across the globe as of 2017, as well as by DeepMind itself. "We've worked closely with the StarCraft II team to develop an API that supports something similar to previous bots written with a 'scripted' interface, allowing programmatic control of individual units and access to the full game state [with some new options as well]," DeepMind said. "Ultimately, agents will play directly from pixels, so to get us there, we've developed a new image-based interface that outputs a simplified low-resolution RGB image data for map and minimap, and the option to break out features into separate 'layers', like terrain heightfield, unit type, unit health, etc." In a blog post about the new collaboration with Blizzard Entertainment, Oriol Vinyals, research scientist at DeepMind, on the AI division's website, wrote: "Over the past five years we've helped to pioneer the use of games as AI research environments to drive our machine learning and reinforcement learning research forwards, from 2D games in Atari, to full 3D environments such as Torcs, mastering the game of Go, or our forthcoming DeepMind Labyrinth." StarCraft will be a new testing environment for Google's AI, and DeepMind sees it as an even better opportunity to try algorithms that could later be applied in real-world scenarios. According to DeepMind, some of the skills that the machine would have to develop in order to master the game include memory, planning over a long time, and adapting its plans according to new information. Vinyals, writes: "We're really excited to see where our collaboration with Blizzard will take us. While we're still a long way from being able to challenge a professional human player at the game of StarCraft II, we hope that the work we have done with Blizzard will serve as a useful testing platform for the wider AI research community."

Samsung to launch new AI assistant Technology Monday 7 November 2016 - 11:10am File: Samsung looks to take on Amazon, Google and Apple with the introduction of an AI assistant in their product range. Photo: Reuters / Kim Hong-Ji JOHANNESBURG - Samsung is set to launch an AI assistant to take on Apple’s Siri with the upcoming Galaxy S8 smartphone. Samsung's announcement comes after Google launched the Pixel smartphone which features Google’s AI assistant, conveniently named Google Assistant.  Samsung acquired Viv Labs in early October, Viv labs is a company founded by Siri’s creators. Samsung said after it acquired Viv Labs the acquisition would bolster the company’s voice search services across its full range of products. The move should help Samsung have a competitive edge over other companies who offer AI assistance in their products. Even though companies like Amazon have an edge having been one of the first to integrate AI assistants in their products, Samsung has a wider range of home appliances including washing machines, refrigerators, TV sets, and home theatre systems. Introducing AI assistance or voice search into this wide range of products would give Samsung the upper hand in the smart-home market.  - Sthembiso Lebuso eNCA Comment Now!

Major companies, especially Facebook, have made several attempts to replicate Snapchat’s features in Instagram via Stories, Messenger, and even WhatAapp. After rebranding the company to just Snap Inc. earlier this this summer, it looks like the social media platform has additional plans for growth. This week, it was discovered that an investment company under Alphabet, Google Capital, has made an investment into Snap Inc. As Google Capital rebranded to CapitalG this past week, the company’s portfolio site was updated to include Snap’s logo. Snapchat relies heavily on Google’s cloud infrastructure to function and the company has famously turned down acquisition offers from both Google and Facebook in the past. The latest round of funding made public by Snapchat amounted to $1.81 billion USD in investment back May of 2016, which puts the company’s total value at around $20 billion total. Snapchat has been working with an increasing number of media outlets on new shows for Snapchat and its Spectacles announced this summer have given many in the technology sphere reason to speculate where the company is headed. ViaBusiness Insider Can’t Fix Stupid Interesting Twitters mkt cap is $12 bln vs Snapchat $20 bln. Both are worth significantly less but interesting to see what the latest flash in the pan is going for. What the authors of this site don’t realize as they seem to push Twitter is that once a platform gets older and therefore not hip and cool it starts to lose the trendsters that bury their noses in social media 24/7 to make themselves feel worthwhile. Using Snapchat is the latest version of that.

Let's hear it for data over audio Kotkin: Why Trump won Virgin Mobile has finally upgraded its network to 4G – with an eye-catching deal: Facebook and WhatsApp data usage won't count against your monthly data bundle, a practice known as zero rating. With zero rating, no money changes hands between the network and the service, and in the USA, the practice has proved hugely popular. T-Mobile's "Binge On" service allowed video services to opt-in, giving users toll-free streaming, with the catch that the video was downsampled to 480p resolution. "This offer does not result in any blocking or throttling of content, and there is no prioritisation of WhatsApp or Messenger traffic," a spokesperson told the FT. Even though zero rating was never an "Original Sin" when the Net Neutrality doctrine was conceived, it has recently become the focus of digital activists and lobby groups that represent some large internet companies. They cried foul when Binge On was unveiled, and Google publicly grumbled. Witchfinder General Professor Barbara produced a vast compendium of reasons why T-Mobile had sinned, including the novel argument that "Binge On harms free expression by favoring (sic) commercial entertainment over other forms of video content". But to their dismay, Binge On turned out to be a hit, doubling video usage on the network, gaining a 99 per cent approval rating from users, and helping T-Mobile overtake Sprint. Google eventually joined in too. Empirical research of hard net neutrality rules in Chile, the Netherlands and Slovenia found no evidence to suggest that zero rating harmed consumers. What helped convinced the FCC not to intervene was almost certainly the nature of non-discriminatory of T-Mobile's terms. Every potential video participant could see the cost (zero) and nobody was excluded. A zero-rating framework that dared to exclude startup messaging or video rivals to Facebook would most likely attract the attention of the European Commission, which has it in for the OTTs anyway. Although Google doesn't have the "outsized influence" (in the words of economist Hal Singer) in Europe that it enjoys with the FCC, but net nannies can still cause operators like Virgin Media plenty of trouble – thanks to the connivance of BEREC, the European quango (PDF) of telecoms regulators. BEREC has infuriated ISPs and other service providers by adopting a much more dogmatic position on net neutrality issues than the ones European Parliament explicitly rejected when Barlaymont passed the telecoms package in 2015. BEREC has the job of turning the Parliament's intentions into guidelines. BEREC advises that zero-rating is OK, er... except when it isn't. It's up to national regulators to decide that. "Some practices are clearly prohibited – those where all applications are blocked or slowed down once the data cap is reached except for the zero-rated application(s). Others are less clear-cut and will be need to be assessed by NRAs against a number of criteria set out in the Guidelines," BEREC notes. The ambiguity essentially invites net neutrality activists to have a go. Surprised? You shouldn't be. Two of the four "wise men" chosen by BEREC to do this are legal professors who are strident advocates of hard neutrality – including the Witchfinder General herself – while a third has received funding from Google. BEREC receives €4.1m funding from the European Union, but don't think Brexit will help: EEA/EFTA members like Norway are members, too. ® Sponsored: Customer Identity and Access Management Tips and corrections 1 Comment More from The Register Meet the slimeballs who are openly sabotaging Virgin Media Amazingly slow Shropshire attack causes sluggish services 46 Comments Graduate recruitment site exposed 50,000 CVs sent to Virgin Media UK Kid schools telco: 'So have you heard of access controls?' 28 Comments Virgin Galactic wins US operator's licence for SpaceShipTwo Beardy Branson's bird not cleared for takeoff just yet, but hopeful of flight tests soon 9 Comments Virgin Media boss warns Brexit could hamstring broadband investment Praises May for indicating date on Article 50 trigger 40 Comments Virgin Media costs balloon by MEEELLIONS in wake of Brexit Exclusive Staffer also asks: Why is Richard Branson still in our ads? 88 Comments Virgin signs up record ultrafast broadband subs Revenue up in Blighty, but still playing catch up with BT on triple play 37 Comments Whitepapers Data and Analytics Maturity Model and Business Impact How top performing enterprises use their IT investments to store, process, and use data to make more effective, real-time decisions.

The company’s focus is on discoverability lately, with a new batch of icons sitting on top of your typical Google Now cards to help you find more specific things within Google. In the earliest reports of the new UI showing up, Google was using a design which featured circle icons which all shared the same color. Well, it seems someone has a thing against circles as another UI is being tested that features icons with more original designs. These changes are showing up in the beta versions of the app for some people, but as with the previous UI change, it seems to be server-side A/B testing that not everyone may see. For instance, yours truly still doesn’t see any icons in Google Now’s home page. If you’re fortunate enough, though, then let us know and tell us how you like it.

Business Lyft, Uber, Zipcar, Maven offer Election Day rides Zipcar Mark Lennihan / AP Zipcar is among the companies offering discounted rides on Election Day. Zipcar is among the companies offering discounted rides on Election Day. (Mark Lennihan / AP) Greg GardnerDetroit Free Press Attention millennials, especially those living in cities. Don't panic if it comes down to late Tuesday afternoon. There are no excuses for not voting. Not work hours. Not weather. Not lack of wheels. Uber, Lyft, Google, Zipcar and Maven are offering special discounts or promotions to enable voters of all ages to get to their polling places on time. Uber and Google are offering an "in-app" feature that will help you locate your polling location and then seamlessly request a ride with just the push of a button. When you open the Uber app Tuesday, you'll see a reminder to get out and vote. Then by tapping the "Find Your Polling Place" button, which takes you a site with a Google-generated list of nearest polling stations. Next step: requesting a ride to get there. If you have managed to never take an Uber and will be requesting a ride for the first time, enter the code VOTETODAY to get $20 off. Lyft, in recognition that we are electing the nation's 45th president, will offer a 45% discount on one ride between 7 a.m. and 8 p.m. for metro Detroit passengers. All Detroit Lyft users can access this promotion through the Deal of the Week e-mail they receive Sunday night. Lyft, Uber, Zipcar, Maven offer election day rides Uber, Lyft, Google, Zipcar and Maven are offering special discounts or promotions for election day. Here are some of the deals.

On the car-sharing front, Zipcar will make 74 cars available for free between 6 p.m. and 10 p.m. Tuesday night. But remember, polls close at 8 p.m. One must be a Zipcar member to use the service. Members can reserve free Zipcars on the mobile app or online starting today through Tuesday. New members can join instantly by downloading the app. Zipcar spokeswoman Katelyn Chesley said there will be 26 free cars at the company's stations in the city of Detroit, one at Metro Airport, three in Dearborn, one in Flint, and 43 in Ann Arbor. General Motors' Maven ride-sharing business will offer $5 off all day, according to GM spokeswoman Annalisa Bluhm. No one, however, will be able to complete his or her ballot by app. That must be done the old-school way.

"Now that Google has fixed the bug, Kaspersky Lab experts can reveal the full details of the attack,” Kaspersky said in statement on Monday. READ: Top SA Android malware revealed The first known recent case of a Svpeng attack occurred in mid-July on an using the bug in Chrome for Android which discreetly downloaded itself onto the Android device.  The attacks began by infecting an advert on Adsense and disguised itself as a browser update or an apk file – the standard file type of an Android application.  Once installed and launched, the malware disappeared, making it harder to detect. “The Svpeng mobile banking Trojan is designed to steal bank card information. It also collects call history, text and multimedia messages, browser bookmarks and contacts. Svpeng mainly attacks Russian-speaking countries, however it has the potential to spread globally,” Kaspersky said.  READ: Here's how ransomware hits SA Since its first attacks developers have been studying the virus while the malware’s creators had been testing it.  Experts began investigating the virus with IBM developing countermeasures to detect it earlier.  In 2015, Russian authorities arrested a 25-year-old and four other suspects believed to be behind the Svpeng virus, however the software has since resurfaced.  Read Fin24's top stories trending on Twitter: Fin24’s top stories Read more about: virus  |  smartphone  |  malware share: More In This Category One-third of corporate cyber attacks succeed - survey Hacking group targets Windows, Adobe Flash Pay with your phone using your fingerprint ID Here's what's cheaper than Apple's iCloud storage Most Popular Read Tesla’s future in Trump’s world Arianna Huffington: It's time for a digital detox PICS: Inside one of SA's biggest TV manufacturing plants REVIEWED: LG goes big on its V20 phablet Media fights back as invasion of fake news intensifies Contact us   |   About Us   |   Terms & Conditions NEWS24  |   OLX  |   PROPERTY24  |   CAREERS24  |   SPREE  |

I spent the weekend with LG’s stellar V20 before it hit Vodacom shelves and managed to learn a few things about myself: 1. Internet reviewers miss the point Early reviews are out and the internet doesn’t like where LG put the second screen. The overwhelming sentiment is that it would be more useful at the bottom, where your fingers are. Well, I rarely use it outside of its function as an always-on closk and notifications screen. And that works better on top. 2. I might become an audiophile in a few years My editor Anthony Doman is a fully committed audiophile who build his own amps and has a premium Tidal subscription to cater to his lossless file needs. I like listening to music streamed over Bluetooth because convenience trumps quality in my books. The V20, however, breathed new life into my higher quality files with its quad HiFi DAC and the supplied Beoplay H3 earbuds. Listening to the same music in the car just wasn’t the same. 3. The general public get a better deal than tech journalists Although I consider myself to be post-cellphone case, I’ve also been using a much smaller phone and the V20 review unit has taken a couple of unintentional tumbles. If you buy a V20 today at Vodacom you’ll get a case in the box, mahala. 4. Camera sensors are important This is the same 16 MP + 8 MP wide angle rear camera setup from the G5 and it’s definitely in the top 5 smartphone cameras in the world. While the rest of the market has gone to 12 MP, LG retains the extra pixel detail and delivers some great shots. 5. Camera glass can be important-er That said, the lens of my G5 is quite badly scratched just from everyday use and the artifacts and lens flares on the V20 can get quite pronounced sometimes. It’s a tiny, avoidable flaw that, if addressed, could help LG leapfrog its competition. 6. I should get over my one-hand bias I love the iPhone SE primarily because I can comfortably use it exclusively with one hand. I do find myself wanting to look at the QHD IPS display of the V20 a lot more though. It’s gorgeous. 7. HDR is amazing There’s a lot of hype about HDR in both smartphone photography and TVs, and many manufacturers use it as shorthand for over exposure. Not LG. Here the full dynamic range is preserved with shadows lightened without losing contrast. 8. I’m ready for the future USB type-C is the connector of choice and here I am, veteran of a Huawei P9, Xiaomi Mi 5 and an LG G5 with an army of micro USB to type-C adaptors and type-C cables. All I need is a type-C to type-C cable to connect to the Asus Zenbook 3, MacBook or MacBook Pro. 9. Camera humps should be outlawed It’s 2016, why are phone manufacturers still prioritising slimness over camera protection? That hump causes problems and adds another point of failure for an accidental drop to ruin your life. 10. I don’t care for “premium” hand feel While LG didn’t go the full primer route like on the G5, the V20 has a coating over the removable aluminium back cover. I don’t mind this. And I’m very glad it isn’t a glass back. Plus the top and bottom of the phone are made out of shock-absorbing polydimethyl siloxane. Bootom line: I don’t mind plastic if it makes the phone more hardy. 11. There is still room for other Android manufacturers Samsung’s Galaxy S7 was the least flawed handset of 2016, without question. Google just dropped the Pixel as its vision for the future of Android. I wrote off the smaller manufacturers. I was wrong. Features like manual video control, HD audio recording and a removable battery don’t exist on other premium handsets. If you want that, get the LG V20. 12. I bought into the Pixel hype too quickly I thought Google’s Assistant is a Pixel exclusive and dismissed the non-Assistant phones as being incomplete representations of Android, but it is turning out to be a tarted up version of Google’s already excellent voice search. I was wrong. Please forgive me. 13. Android 7.0 Nougat is amazing I don’t care to much for LG’s Optimus UI Android “enhancements” the core functions of Nougat are still intact and are big improvement and refinement for the platform. 14. Maybe the MacBook Pro touch strip isn’t a bad idea Having a contextually aware dedicated function strip like the second screen of the LG V20 is quite useful for quick or frequently used settings. 15. My phablet sweet spot is 5,5-inch So after I got over my dislike of using a smartphone with two hands, the poke-out-of-your-pocket qualities of the 5,7-inch screen real estate was the next hurdle. I just prefer a phone to comfortably fit inside the pockets of all my pants. One unintentional drop was from the pocket of a pair of shorts. 16. I’ve outgrown hot-swappable micro SD cards You’ll never no how much you miss the convenience of a removable battery until you get a device that can fully recharge in the time it takes you to replace the empty battery with a freshly charged one. The downside is that LG decided to go old school with the sim and micro SD card slot as well. And after I reassembled the V20 from one of those drops (it breaks apart like a Nokia 5110), I didn’t put the memory card in properly. Now this wouldn’t have been a problem if I didn’t reach Google Play Music’s draconian 10 authorised device limit and if I could actually figure out how you deauthorise devices. Moral of the story, Google Play Music is the default music player on Android Auto and while it can play locally stored files, when it tries to do that from an incorrectly inserted SD card, it causes some issues. I lost all record of my music library and had to exit Android Auto to get playback over Bluetooth. Android Marshmallow brought back SD card support as adopted storage, not ideal to then have a hot-swappable card. 17. I don’t really need water resistance Besides for a near mishap while bathing my daughter, no need for submersion ingress protection. 18. All fingerprint readers should be always on You don’t need to press the power button for the phone to scan your finger and unlock. Touch and go. 19. LG designers and engineers learnt a lot from the G5 Those plastic bits on the top and bottom of the phone I mentioned earlier? It would’ve saved me from a frustrating SmartLab repair experience had it been on the G5 – thankfully LG has moved to WeFix as its repair partner now. Also abandoning the modular system was a very wise move. 20. The G5 is a better phone than you think Besides for the build quality issues (the bottom chin didn’t fit flush because it catered to the modular idea), that HiFi amp and a few software differences, the G5 is a now much cheaper and more pocketable alternative to the V20. Is the V20 worth its R12 000 pricetag? Yes. But if you can’t afford it or Vodacom (exclusive sellers) doesn’t have stock, the LG G5 is a great second choice.

Search Engine Roundtable     Home Browse by Categories Browse By Dates Search » Turn Off Mobile Site [X] Close Home > Google News > Google Maps > Google Closes Google Showtimes Google Closes Google Showtimes Nov 7, 2016 • 7:49 am | (6) by Barry Schwartz | Filed Under Google Maps Prev Story Next Story Google has shut down the Google Showtimes service, which was available at google.com/movies for a long long time. The message on the site now reads: Google Showtimes was discontinued on November 1, 2016. You can now discover showtimes on the search results page by searching for the name of the movie you want to see or try searching for the word "movies" to discover what’s in theaters. Sincerely, The Google Showtimes team True, all you need to do now is search Google for [movies] and you get a list of movies playing nearby. There are a bunch of searchers not happy with this, including this thread at the Google Web Search Help forums and WebmasterWorld thread. Here are their thoughts: The suggested keyword search for "movies" is a useless and HORRIBLE suggestion that serves to insult anyone who understands search protocols. The functionality of GOOGLE SHOWTIMES is gone totally and is not replaced by a lame search or the crazy Fandago mashup. Google has stopped showing lyrics for at least a month, too. Has that been announced as well? Seems like a pattern at Google where they're pulling back from licensing or repurposing other site's content? Forum discussion at Google Web Search Help and WebmasterWorld. Prev Story Next story Tweet This Previous story: Daily Search Forum Recap: November 4, 2016   Comments: Ethan Glover 11/07/2016 04:23 pm I honestly forgot about that service. But I'm glad that they're at least working on merging those separate services into search. I think there's a reason people forget about google.com/movies... because they just search for showtimes. And if Google can cover that in the search itself, that's much better. Barry Schwartz 11/07/2016 04:26 pm Thanks Ethan! Gustavo Pelogia 11/08/2016 11:26 am Lyrics are still in SERPs. Just tried a couple and I see them the same ways as a few months ago. Anthony Tornambe 11/09/2016 05:47 am Still in Google search. Chris 11/12/2016 08:27 pm But it isn't search, and that is the whole point of the complaint. Yes you can search for movie X or for theater Y, but that wasn't what the point of showtimes was. Showtimes showed you ALL of the movies in the nearby theaters. It didn't require you to know the movie nor the theater. That was the beauty of it. That service no longer exists. Other platforms offer a similar service but they don't do as good of a job as Google did.

Thursday will see the release of Google’s Daydream View VR headset. The $79 Daydream View announced in October will only support the Google Pixel and Pixel XL at launch, but it’ll work with any future phones built upon Google’s Daydream VR platform. The View also ships with a custom wireless controller that hopes to become "the mouse of VR," as Google's Andrew Nartker put it. Is the Daydream VR better than the Samsung Galaxy Gear VR headset? Watch for our review to find out. Thursday also marks the retail availability of the Playstation 4 Pro. The $399 PS4 Pro announced in September features 4K and HDR output thanks to some higher-specced guts. Both Netflix and YouTube committed to developing HDR streaming apps for the PS4 Pro as well. Mark Cerny, chief architect of the PS4, said the PS4 Pro is intended "to take the PS4 experience to extraordinary new levels." Does it? We’ll let you know in our forthcoming review. Microsoft’s updated Surface Book also goes on sale Thursday with refreshed internals that improve graphics performance and battery life. We’ll soon see if it’s worth the price: $2,399 (256GB), $2,799 (512GB), and $3,299 (1TB). We’ve also got another installment of The Walking Dead Redemption Club this week, and we’ll tell you why bad movies are the best movies to watch on airplanes. But that’s just a taste of what promises to be a big week ahead.

Comparing one with the other will help us understand them both. NB: This is a viewpoint by Pablo Delgado, CEO of Mirai. Where is the booking made? Inside TripAdvisor and Google respectively, without leaving their website or app. What is their objective? In both cases, improving the user experience by eliminating the loss produced when redirecting to the OTA’s or hotel’s website, thus increasing conversion in these bookings. Can I “connect”  my direct sales? What do I need to “connect”? Yes, through a partner integrated with TripAdvisor and Google.  You need to collaborate with an integrated partner. Is it a space reserved exclusively for direct sales? Can I stop OTAs from “connecting”? No. OTAs also have access. To stop them from “connecting” you can negotiate with them directly but it would have to be one by one and would not be a realistic option as of today. How much does it cost? Instant Booking: only offers a CPA (commission) model in two formats: 12% or 15%. Book on Google: is technically free, although to activate it you need to participate in Google Hotel Ads, which has a cost whether it’s in CPC or CPA mode (10% to 15% 50%).*Corrected, 9 Nov. Sorry! How many entries does the client see in the search results? On TripAdvisor, as many as there are OTAs bidding on it, although there is only a single “Book Now” button (message that constantly changes as TripAdvisor is always testing). This message usually occupies a prominent position in the results. Google also shows as many OTAs as are bidding although, unlike Instant Booking, all entries (both OTAs and direct sales) may activate Book on Google. If I don’t participate with my direct channel, will OTAs do so? Instant Booking: if you don’t participate, OTAs will and Booking.com is the most aggressive of them all. Book on Google: it’s irrelevant. OTAs can use it regardless of what you do. Are they selling their brand or yours? Instant Booking: the client knows and is aware that he’s booking on TripAdvisor, since the message is prominent. Book on Google: it’s the channel name which stands out (OTA or official website), so the client ends up booking on Google without knowing. Once the booking process has started, does the client know he’s booking through the direct channel? Who sends the booking confirmation to the client? Both state that they are “connected” in the background with the hotel directly, although they do so subtly and always under the TripAdvisor and Google image and logo. The booking confirmation is sent by the channel that’s connected “in the background”. If it’s your direct sale, the client will receive an email like if he’d booked on your website.   Has it become an OTA? Instant Booking: yes, although with many nuances Book on Google: no, although with some nuances. Should I participate? Instant Booking: if no OTAs are connected, our recommendation is to compare ROI from connecting to Tripconnect compared to that of Instant Booking. However, if Booking.com connects (as it usually does with all hotels), you should participate as a defensive strategy. Book on Google: it depends on the importance that you give to profitability vs. distancing yourself from the client, with the risk that he becomes loyal to Google and not you. Our recommendation is to give it a try and make a final decision with real data of your hotel. Conclusion Book on Google and Instant Booking have as many differences as points in common. However, this isn’t really relevant. The underlying problem in all of this is that the direct sale, much to our disliking, is getting more and more complicated every day. Therefore, we will have to get used to coexisting with Google and TripAdvisor and learn how to use them intelligently to make more money and reduce OTA dependence. The challenge will undoubtedly be (and this is what OTAs hang onto) moving sales from OTAs to the direct channel and making it profitable while still paying fees for Google Hotel Ads or Instant Booking. At Mirai we believe that this is possible but we also know that it’s not as simple as connecting your search engine and wait for the bookings to come in. The key, once again, is to have a good strategy and to implement it skilfully. NB1: This is a viewpoint by Pablo Delgado, CEO of Mirai.

Samsung may have suffered quite a blow with its exploding smartphones. So, it has decided to enter new territory to win back the lost fans. It has announced that it will be introducing its own artificially-intelligent smart assistant, a la Google Assistant or Siri, as part of its Galaxy S8 series available from next year. Why not, given Apple, Microsoft, Google, and even Amazon now have one? Plus, Samsung needs to make up the over-$5.4-billion loss it expects to endure till mid-2017, according to Reuters, thanks to the withdrawal of the inflammable S7 phones. Samsung's Siri killer to debut on the Galaxy S8 https://t.co/oZ5k8cWtwu— David Papp (@DavidPapp) November 7, 2016 Samsung’s assistant will be device-agnostic, which would make it work across home appliances and wearable devices too, and have seamless integration with third-party services, according to reports. This might give Samsung’s TVs, washing machines, refrigerators that edge in the home appliances market too. Back in October this year, the South-Korean electronics firm had announced a takeover of Viv Labs Inc., a San-Jose-based stealth startup focussed on AI development comprised of engineers who created Siri. Viv hopes to be a superior parser of user’s queries and provide optimal answers by generating algorithms integrated from several third-party developers. The firm has gone in for a collaborative-technology model, whereby, according to Samsung VP Rhee Injong, “Developers can attach and upload services to our agent. Even if Samsung doesn’t do anything on its own, the more services that get attached the smarter this agent will get, learn more new services and provide them to end-users with ease.” Samsung’s hope is that its brand-new AI tech will surpass Apple’s and Google’s with a voice-assistant that is a lot more interactive and intelligent. After Google introduced its own assistant in the Pixel series, Samsung faced a new rival in the smartphone arena. The S8 is likely to be released at the Mobile World Congress 2017 event in February 2017. More In: Technology | Sci-Tech Tweet Please Wait while comments are loading...

To help you keep up with what’s going on, Google and YouTube have outlined their plans to keep you informed on Election Day. Google is giving a pop-up at the top of the screen that you can click to find where to vote in your area. Google will also offer details and updates about what’s going on in the election with results for the presidential, Senatorial, Congressional, and Gubernatorial races. Details on state referenda and ballot propositions will be updated the same way. Google had been helping people find where to register to vote and giving voters details on who they can vote for. Google notes that traffic for “how to vote” has increased 233% compared to the same search in 2012. American’s are also searching for “where to vote” and Google is offering county-by-county breakdowns in battleground states. For those who are still undecided on who to vote for, YouTube has the presidential debates for anyone to watch. As the race unfolds on Tuesday, starting at 7pm YouTube will carry live coverage from NBC, PBS, MTV, Bloomberg, Telemundo, and The Young Turks. Once the race is decided, the victory speech from the new President-elect will be streamed as well. This will be the perfect way for people who lack cable to keep up to date with the election as it unfolds.

By: Stephanie Taylor Metro Published on Pot bellied pig appeal Winnipeg woman Emily Sydor is fighting an order from the city to get rid of her male pot bellied pig. The city’s animal services agency says hogs are not allowed to be kept in the city under The Responsible Pet Ownership By-law.  In a letter from August, Sydor states neither noise nor smell are issues and her immediate neighbours have made no actual complaints and “love his presence.” Sydor says her mental well-being is at stake, noting the pig is being trained as a service animal.  “I have a special bond with this pet that cannot be replaced with any other animal,” she writes.  Sydor goes on to say the pig is “friendly, affectionate, intelligent, well trained, non aggressive and a threat to no one.” The appeal hearing was granted a one month adjournment in October, and will be heard before Monday’s committee on protection, parks and community services.  Monday's committee will also deal with a request to conduct a cross-jurisdictional review of rules and standards around fire pits.  David Lipnowski/For Metro Google wants to enter into a data sharing agreement with the City of Winnipeg for its traffic app Google wants Winnipeg’s traffic data The city is being asked to share its traffic data with Google Inc., in order to join its Connected Citizen Program and Waze app. The program is being marketed as a “free, two-way traffic data exchange” that builds on Google’s other efforts to collect real-time data from drivers.  In a report written for Monday's infrastructure renewal and public works committee meeting, traffic manager Luis Escobar explains the program is aimed at helping local governments make better decisions around infrastructure planning and offer faster incident response times thanks to better data.  The type of information Google wants shared would be accident reports, road closures and incidents of traffic congestion the city collects through crews and 311.  By entering into a one-year agreement, Escobar writes, the city would receive road incident reports faster than through typical methodology and have access to Waze, Google’s community-driven traffic app.  “Partners use Waze to inform drivers of major traffic events and drivers communicate back real-time road insights through the app,” the report reads.  The city would also agree to promote the app to drivers. Tuesday’s committee will also be asked to approve spending $660,000 extra on the city's new transportation management centre due to what a report calls “unforeseen” work required on the traffic signals branch. Lyle Stafford/For Metro Deputy chief Danny Smyth will be officially sworn in as the Winnipeg Police Service's new chief of police during a special ceremony on Tuesday Smyth to get sworn in It’s official. Winnipeg will have a new chief of police this week.  Deputy chief Danny Smyth will be sworn in as the city's new top cop during a special ceremony on Tuesday.  The 30-year veteran of the force and North End resident was accepted as the chosen candidate for the job by the Winnipeg Police Board at its most recent meeting.  Smyth replaces Devon Clunis, who retired in July.  Stephanie Taylor/Metro The mostly vacant tower at 266 Graham Avenue sits behind the new Winnipeg Police Service headquarters on 245 Smith Street 266 Graham to get shelter City hall is one step closer to ridding itself of a mostly vacant Canada Post tower attached to its new police headquarters. A new report calls for the city to enter into a due diligence agreement with Shelter Canadian Properties Limited in anticipation of a new development plan for the 11-storey tower. Shelter was one of six respondents to the city’s call for expressions of interest to redevelop the tower, which was issued back in March. Details of what Shelter is proposing were not included in the report.  Earlier this year, finance staff said the city was on track to lose out on $1.8 million in missed revenues from the vacancy.  The tower was purchased in 2009 as part of a $30 million deal to buy an adjacent warehouse, which has since become the new home of the city’s police service. The federal government had occupied part of the tower when it was initially purchased, but moved in late 2014, leaving it two-thirds empty.  It was initially supposed to be sold for $18 million, but officials later discovered it required $20 million worth of renovation.  Winnipeg police previously expressed concerns of falling victim to “counter-surveillance” from a potential tenant.  The report indicates that one residential development pitched for the site was deemed “not acceptable from the WPS perspective.” Growth fees working group details? The public is still waiting on details on who will appointed to a new growth fees working group.  The group is to be comprised of up to nine industry members and one councillor.  Their job for the next three years is to deliver advice to council on the city’s growth fees plan, including whether or not to expand the levy onto new commercial, industrial and infill properties, and adjust the rates. Council will have to approve membership to the group, which is expected to get started on work this month.  Editors' Picks Glamour magazine defines the word 'woman' in mysterious ways by naming Bono one Interest in 'moving to Canada' spiked on election night in Google search Fear disguised as hope as unthinkable happens: Trump is president-elect My dog misbehaves in public: What should I do?

Published on November 07, 2016. Most Popular The machines are rising. They are planning our days, making our reservations, ordering our cars. We talk to Alexa, Siri, Cortana and Google like we would a human assistant. But how do these AI systems compare? Here's a look at what they do, how they're marketed and what they'll do next. Siri, made by Apple Credit: Apple Siri Made by Apple Origins: Siri was perhaps the first virtual personal assistant to enter the mainstream, debuting on the iPhone in 2011. Functions: Siri only widely opened to third-party apps this year with the arrival of iOS 10. That's allowed developers outside Apple to give it capabilities such as hailing an Uber if you simply ask for one, which so far is the pinnacle of achievement for most consumer-facing AI. Major malfunction: Siri was criticized early on for poor speech recognition because Apple was behind rivals in "neural network" technology—that's nerd-speak for computers that act more like human brains. Apple improved this technology this year. Upgrades: Siri is getting smarter with Apple TV. A viewer can ask it to pull up a livestream from inside Apple TV apps. It also is embedded into Apple CarPlay for hands-free control of key systems like navigation, music and messaging. And Siri is gaining control of homes through Apple HomeKit. Marketing: In the past year, Apple has played up Siri's talk-to-TV capabilities in TV commercials. It's also relied on stars like Zooey Deschanel and Cookie Monster in work done by Apple agency TBWA/Media Arts Lab. Alexa on Echo, made by Amazon Credit: Amazon Alexa Made by Amazon Origins: Alexa is the name Amazon gave the digital assistant living inside its Echo home device, which started selling widely in June 2015. Functions: Alexa began with limited uses, most often responding from the in-home speaker to requests for things like weather and news. Alexa can also find a radio station from TuneIn. It's an Amazon pitchwoman through and through, so it will take commands like remembering your shopping list. Major malfunction: Alexa isn't in your phone; it's stuck inside the Echo or the newer Dot device. Amazon just made it available in its tablets. Upgrades: This fall, Alexa connected with Amazon's TV device to control streaming video. And it made the leap from simply taking dictation around shopping lists to now placing the orders. Alexa also has a program to control the home environment. Tinkerers have hacked the device to perform functions like starting their Tesla cars remotely. Marketing: The company is running an ambitious series of 100 digital vignettes called "Alexa Moments," 10 seconds each, to show its versatility. Tool of North America is the agency. Cortana Made by Microsoft Origins: Cortana was introduced in 2014, named after the AI character in the hit Xbox game "Halo." Cortana, made by Microsoft Credit: Microsoft Functions: Microsoft calls Cortana a "digital agent." It can handle basics like controlling calendars, getting weather and taking dictation on an email. Major malfunction: Like all AI-powered assistants, Cortana is only as smart as its programming, and Cortana gets much of its information from Microsoft's Bing. It does not use Google, the search leader. That's not a "malfunction," but it is different. Upgrades: Microsoft has put Cortana into its Edge web browser, which means it's there to help complete online tasks such as making reservations or looking for discounts while shopping. Cortana also works with Google Android and Apple iOS devices. Microsoft wants Cortana to be everywhere, including of course its own ecosystem, from the Xbox to Skype to LinkedIn. Marketing: Microsoft's most memorable Cortana commercials are the ones that go directly after Siri, something it has done a few times over the years in spots from M:United. Assistant, made by Google Credit: Google Assistant Made by Google Origins: In 2012, Google answered Apple's Siri by adding Google Now to phones. Google's AI advanced this year with Google Home, an Echo competitor, and a new messaging app called Allo, both bearing a voice-commanded helper known simply as Google Assistant. It's also the engine for Now. Functions: Google Assistant acts like Siri or Cortana, as an assistant that can call up information and perform tasks like turning on Spotify and giving directions. Of course, Google taps into its own knowledge graph to retrieve the relevant information for consumers, which gives it an advantage as it expands capabilities. Major malfunction: Privacy is a concern for all AI-powered devices invading our homes, but Google gets higher scrutiny on this issue because of all the data it has. It's going to be a challenge to balance privacy with always-on. ever-listening digital assistance. Upgrades: Assistant can perform tasks like finding flights. The assistant also syncs with Chromecast, giving people voice control over their digital TV experience. Marketing: Google is promoting its new Pixel phone with TV spots calling it the first phone with Assistant. Droga 5 is the agency.

Though this is good news for the team, this is actually bad news for users who enjoyed using the software to run Android games on their PC. AndroidAuthority has learned that LeapDroid users can still rely on the software to run Android apps, but they should not expect further updates from now on. Furthermore, interested users will not be able to download the software anymore because official downloads have been removed from the Internet. The obvious reason why the software is not getting updates moving forward is due to the fact that the team behind it will focus on working with Google to “continue pushing the frontier of technology.” Sharing details about the big move in their careers, co-founders Huan Ren and Huihong Luo wrote on the official LeapDroid blog: “Today, we’re excited to announce the next phase of our journey — we are joining Google.” Related Stories Introductory Subscription Prices Set To Arrive For Android Apps New Look For The Google Play Store Leaked Google Reports Vulnerability In Flash, Windows “In order to focus on our next chapter, we have decided to discontinue the development of LeapDroid emulator … We’ve been so proud to build LeapDroid and can’t wait to show you more of what we’ll be working on at Google,” they added. The LeapDroid co-founders also revealed that it took them over a year to build LeapDroid after starting working on it back in 2015. The announcement may have come as shocking news to users, since LeapDroid was only released to the public months ago. Even though it’s good to know that users can still run the latest version of the software, it’s quite unfortunate to know that both development and support for LeapDroid have been discontinued. Engadget reports that specific details about the deal are not available, but the team is implying that this is not technically an acquisition because LeapDroid is not in the picture and will not be affiliated with Google.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search LeapDroid creators join Google, abandons Android PC emulator JC Torres - Nov 7, 2016 0 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit In most company acquisitions, there’s always fears of the new owners mercilessly axing the newly acquired company’s product. That might look like the case with LeapDroid, but it’s different in two significant ways. First, it is only the developers, not LeapDroid itself that has been “acquired” by Google. And second, it is the developers themselves that have decided to ditch LeapDroid. This has the effect of practically killing an Android emulator for PCs that, just a few months ago, boasted to be the fastest in the market. There is no shortage of Android emulators out there, with Bluestacks probably the most popular, so the death of LeapDroid might not have even made a sound if not for the rather bold claim it made last July and why they’re suddenly shutting down. When LeapDroid landed on the scene, it claimed to be the “most powerful Android game player” on PCs. Its benchmarks showed how it outclassed its peers in games, admittedly the most taxing type of Android apps. Naturally, it didn’t spill the beans on how it accomplished that, only claiming some specialized LeapGL and Virt Fiber I/O techs, but there must have been some truth to it if Google took notice. That said, co-founders Huan Ren and Huihong Luo only said they were joining Google, not exactly that Google tripped over to hire them. Even more curious, LeapDroid itself isn’t part of that newfound relationship with Google. Not only does it remain not part of Google, it has also been officially discontinued, less than four months after its announcement. Without any confirmation, not even “insider information”, we can only read between the lines. Google might have interests in the technology LeapDroid uses, but would conflict with LeapDroid if the emulator were to continue existing separately from Google. As to what Google plans to do with that technology, one can only speculate as well. The emulation technology could be used in many places, including improving Android Studio’s own emulator. Or it could be used to improve how Android apps run on other platforms, like Windows or, better yet, Chrome OS.

Separately, Google quietly made an undisclosed investment in Snap. Chief Executive Officer Evan Spiegel and co-founder and Chief Technology Officer Bobby Murphy together control about 74 percent of the company, according to an analysis by Equidate, a stock market for private technology companies. That compares with the 41 percent that Google’s Larry Page and Sergey Brin had after their IPO, and the 56 percent Mark Zuckerberg held after Facebook’s. Snap, formerly known as Snapchat, is asking public-market investors to back its management team and support their potential to build the next technology juggernaut. The company behind the social media app that’s wildly popular with teens and millennials is aiming to raise as much as $4 billion in an IPO that could value it at $25 billion to $35 billion, people familiar with the matter have said. This year, Snap is aiming for revenue of $350 million. Snap plans to go public as early as March. The filing on Monday in Delaware, which laid out the founders’ voting rights, indicates that the company is cleaning up its ownership structure in preparation. Google seems to approve. Alphabet’s growth equity division, previously called Google Capital, renamed itself to CapitalG on Friday. With the re-brand, the firm also disclosed a recent investment in Snap. A spokeswoman for CapitalG declined to share the total investment. * With assistance from Mark Bergen and Alex Barinka BLOOMBERG Like us on Facebook Connect with us on LinkedIn Hungry for more business news?

This lets you pay for apps, games, and books on Google Play directly from your bank account, instead of using credit or debit card. This will be more useful for people who don’t have a credit card. To use netbanking billing, when you make a purchase, you just need to choose the bank you have added on the prompt in the store. This will redirect you to the secure page for the bank where you can add your login details and pay for the purchase. Most of the popular banks, including State Bank, Indian Bank, Axis Bank, CitiBank are listed, but some banks like Standard Charted are missed out. Hope we can expect Google to officially roll out this feature more widely in coming days. Via "Google Play Store Netbanking payment support starts rolling out in India", 5 out of 5 based on 28 ratings.

Here are a few great ways to use Google Calendar that are a little out of the ordinary, but are well worth your time. 1) Log your life Thanks to the magic of IFTTT (as previously featured on Field Guide) you can use Google Calendar as a life-logging diary rather than a schedule. It's easy to automatically import working hours, weather conditions, Foursquare check-ins, Fitbit goals and dozens of other data points.. If you're completely new to IFTTT go ahead and sign up for a free account then click the Search button at the top to find Google Calendar-related applets (previously known as recipes). You can see some examples of applets created by others or build your own. Your life-logging Google Calendar can be as quiet or as busy as you want it to be. You could generate an entry every time you create a new contact in iOS for example (how long have we known each other?), or every time your Samsung washing machine starts a cycle. 2) Plan your meals Google Calendar entries have more features than you might realize and a lot of them can help you plan meals for the family or your housemates. Ability to schedule events? Check. Option to invite guests? Check. Attachments and descriptions for recipes? Another check. Get your meal calendar organized correctly and you have yourself an orderly, shared Google calendar where everyone can see what's coming up, what needs to be bought, and who's going to be attending (maybe your homemade pizzas aren't that tasty after all). The attachment in event entries can be used to upload pretty much any file you like. You can add a PDF with a recipe on it or a picture that shows what a dish is actually supposed to look like, for example. You can even add a video call and live stream the cooking. 3) Update your social networks Not only can IFTTT be used to pipe events from other services into Google Calendar, it can be used to send posts in the other direction too. In this case, you can set up scheduled events on Google Calendar to post Twitter or Facebook updates at particular times. The usual caveats apply about scheduling social media posts, namely that you shouldn't plan too far ahead for fear of your posts looking incredibly insensitive or out of touch depending on breaking news events (whether in your circle of friends or across the world). From the menu (top-right) choose Create and then pick Google Calendar as the "this". Any new event starts is your trigger, and then the action (the "that") can be text posts on Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr and so on (you can even wish your friends a happy birthday). 4) Track your TV shows There are a plethora of publicly shared Google Calendars out there you can subscribe to. Your sports team probably has one, and your office manager probably has one too, and if you know where to look, they're also available for your favorite TV shows. That's right. You can subscribe to a custom television calendar and never miss an episode of Game of Thrones again, or get caught unawares by a Sherlock and Elementary clash again. Several sites do this for you, but EpisodeCalendar is one of the best we've seen. Once you've signed up, specify the shows you're interested in and create a customized calendar of TV goodness just for you. There's a ton of functionality to explore on the site itself, but head to Settings under My profile to find a link you can import into Google Calendar.

Keep up with the latest threats from around the world with Nextgov's Threatwatch.  UK Hospitals Cancel Operations Because of Computer Virus A computer virus caused three English hospitals to cancel operations and outpatient services for days. Northern Lincolnshire and Goole NHS Foundation Trust, which runs three hospitals, said experts advised it to shut down its systems so the virus could be isolated and destroyed, the BBC reported. A hospital executive said all adult patients’ appointments were canceled unless a patient exhibited a pressing clinical need, and major trauma and high-risk women in labor were sent to other facilities. Other services, such as chemotherapy, continued.  The trust discovered the virus Oct. 30 and brought most systems back online late Wednesday, but has disclosed few details about it.  Microsoft Says Russian Hackers Attacked Google-Reported Zero Day Russia-linked hackers exploited a previously unknown vulnerability in the Windows operating system Google disclosed before Microsoft had a patch ready. Google on Oct. 31 said a critical vulnerability in a Windows kernel was being actively exploited, and that the announcement comes seven days after its discovery per its policy. Microsoft responded in a blog post Tuesday, and it was not thrilled. “We believe responsible technology industry participation puts the customer first, and requires coordinated vulnerability disclosure. Google’s decision to disclose these vulnerabilities before patches are broadly available and tested is disappointing, and puts customers at increased risk,” Terry Myerson, Windows and Devices Group executive vice president, wrote in the post. Microsoft also said the threat actor it calls Strontium, but also known as Fancy Bear or APT 28, used the flaw plus two Adobe Flash flaws to conduct “low-volume spear-phishing campaigns.” The group is linked to the Democratic National Committee email breaches and other recent cyber incidents at political organizations and think tanks.  “STRONTIUM is an activity group that usually targets government agencies, diplomatic institutions and military organizations, as well as affiliated private sector organizations such as defense contractors and public policy research institutes,” the blog post said. Microsoft said it is testing patches for release Nov. 8 and that customers should consider upgrading to Windows 10. The Shadow Brokers Post List of Allegedly Hacked Servers  The hacking group that tried to sell National Security Agency hacking tools says it knows which servers the agency has used for spying operations. The Shadow Brokers published files Oct. 31 it claims are 306 domains and 352 IP addresses of servers compromised by the Equation Group—hackers suspected, but not confirmed, to be an NSA unit, according to Motherboard. If the list is authentic, organizations could use it to see if they have been targeted by the Equation Group, security experts told Motherboard. A Flashpoint analysis said the configuration information in the files suggested the servers were used for covert reconnaissance operations performed between 2000 and 2010. The analysis also found most servers were located in China, Japan and Korea.   recommended for you Threatwatch Alert Thousands of cyber attacks occur each day See the latest threats ADD A COMMENT Emerging Technology: The Government of the Future Has Arrived Textual Chemistry: Getting to Know Citizens Through Their Words The Inimitable Effect of Standing on Productivity The Decision-Making Science of Effective Healthcare FROM OUR SPONSORS sponsored Get Smart.

Surprisingly, one of the first to do so isn’t a new high-end smartphone but a more budget friendly one. General Mobile has announced the existence of the GM 5, which is the first Android One device to come with Android 7.0 Nougat right out of the box. So yes, apparently Android One still does exist, despite the Nexus program seemingly obsoleted. Like the Nexus, Android One was meant to offer a vanilla Android experience. Unlike the Nexus, however, Google gave OEMs more free reign in the design of the device. To some extent, it is the complete contrast of the Google Pixel. As far as the smartphone itself is concerned, the GM 5 is your average mid-range smartphone. It sports a 5-inch 720p screen and is powered by a 1.2 GHz 64-bit quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon processor. There’s 2 GB of memory and 16 B of expandable storage. There’s a 13 megapixel main camera and a 5 megapixel shooter on the other side. The highlight of the smartphone is, of course, Android 7.0 Nougat, making it one of if not the first mid-range smartphone to have it right off the bat. This is an unadulterated version of Android, of course, but sadly, but not unexpected, doesn’t have all the perks that the Google Pixel has. Like Google Assistant. GM 5 owners will have to settle for Google Now. Like any Android One, the GM 5 will most likely be available in emerging markets, though General Mobile does bring its devices to Europe as well. No launch date or price has been announced yet.

Twitter Facebook Google+ LinkedIn Instagram YouTube RSS Skip to content SEO News Content Marketing Social Media Paid Search Work Life Events Advertise When Should You Choose Canonical vs. 301 Redirect? SEO November 1, 2016 SEO Irina HeyNovember 1, 2016 648SHARES 2.1KREADS 648SHARES 2.1KREADS Irina Hey 648SHARES 2.1KREADS Duplicate content is a problem every webmaster will be confronted with at some point. For Google and other search engines, duplicate content is initially not a negative signal. However, identical and similar content from different URLs can cause confusion and lead to ranking problems. To avoid duplicate content, you can either make use of canonical tags or 301 redirects. Both methods can be very effective when used in a targeted manner. This article will show when to use which approach. Duplicate Content Can Affect Any Website Measures taken for onpage optimization are usually clearly definable for website owners. There are standard recommendations for meta titles or descriptions, as well as clear rules on which heading structure is most suitable for users and search engines. Likewise, a clear keyword focus can significantly affect the position in the SERPs. However, when it comes to the distinction between the need for a canonical tag, or a redirect, many webmasters and SEOs hit problems. Due to the uncertainty, there is the danger of wrongly implementing one or the other. This may ultimately lead to undesired results and the complete opposite of the planned optimization. For instance, when avoiding duplicate content, but rendering sections of the website not indexable or crawlable. For that reason, it is critical to clarify the function of redirects and canonicals: Canonical Tag Canonical Tags are used to signal search engines the preferred version of a web page to be indexed. If there are two identical web pages with different URLs, the second version will refer to the original web page via canonical tags. Thus, telling Google and other search engines which version is to be indexed. The referring web page will still be crawled. The canonical tag is implemented into the head section of web page. Alterations at the server level are not necessary. As soon as a crawler visits the web page, it reads the tag and indexes the canonical web page. A canonical tag may also refer to the same web page to prevent plagiarized websites. Example: www.page.com/a and www.page.com/b are pages with similar content, but different URLs. On page /b, the following canonical tag is implemented: SEOs use canonical tags when content is being repeated or when unique URLs can not be generated. Good examples would be accessibility via different URLs (www.domain.de, domain.de, www.domain.de/index.html, etc.), accessibility with or without trailing slashes (“/”), or if the content can be displayed in different formats (e.g. printable version, as well as a PDF version, etc.). 301 Redirect A 301 redirect is a permanent redirect of a web page to a different URL. Usually, users do not notice such redirects. Every 301 redirect passes on link strength of almost 100 percent. To implement 301 redirects, website owners will need to adjust the .htaccess file, as permanent redirects need to be deposited onto the server. At first, a browser or crawler sends a URL request to the server. The server then matches the request to the .htaccess file and redirects the URL to a different URL, given that there is a relevant listing. 301 redirects can be used in different ways. Usually, they are utilized when URLs change and user-friendliness would suffer due to error pages. Likewise, the 301 redirect can be used to avoid duplicate content. Example: An entry in the .htaccess file could look like this if the website http://page.com is to be permanently redirected to http://www.page.com. 301 Redirect and Canonical Tag in Action To make use and differentiation of canonical tags and 301 redirects more comprehensible, here are some examples. Scenario 1: Similar Products with Similar Descriptions in an Online Shop This is an issue that many online shop owners and operators face. Given the vast inventory of many online stores, there are many similar or almost identical products (e.g. same color or model number). Hence, these products will have similar product descriptions but will be indexed with differing URLs. By having an indication of the product in the URL, users know what to expect when clicking on the link. On the other hand, multiple URLs for similar products also lead to duplicate content in search engines. The solution: To avoid duplicate content, it is important that only one URL is indexed by Google. The easiest way to do this is to use the canonical tag. This way, Google knows, which URL to index. Example: There are two websites for similar products myshop.com/shoe1-yellow and myshop.com/shoe1-blue If Google should index only one URL and define /shoe1-yellow as the original, then the following canonical tag must be inserted into the section on the /shoe1-blue website: Important: If possible, use only complete URLs within the canonical tag. Scenario 2: A New Version of a Web Page Is Launched You run a blog and have written an article that is now being updated and renewed. As a result, not only does the content change but the URL as well. To prevent losing existing traffic to the old article, the old URL is ideally redirected to the new one. The link strength will be almost entirely passed on. That is especially important if the first article has frequently been linked to by other websites. The solution: A 301 redirect will securely redirect the old URL to the new one without creating any disadvantages. It is advisable to drive traffic through fresh links (internal and backlinks) to the new URL as well, so that search engines can replace the new URL with the old URL as soon as possible. Scenario 3: Conversion of the Website from HTTP to HTTPs Many websites are being converted to the encrypted https version. This increases the user’s security, and the change may give webmasters a ranking benefit. However, this conversion can lead to duplicate content, as Google indexes both the http and the https version. To avoid this problem, a 301 redirect can be used once again. The http version of the website will be redirected entirely to the https version. Important: The permanent redirects may increase the loading time significantly for large sites. The solution for smaller websites: All web pages are redirected to the https version via the 301 redirect. The solution for very large websites: The rel=canonical refers to the https version as the original URL. This way, crawlers are encouraged to index the https version. Scenario 4: A Product is No Longer Carried in the Online Shop Product offerings in online shops regularly change. A product might be sold out, or is removed for other reasons. If the URL is deleted upon removal of a product, the user experience suffers as the server can no longer find the requested URL, and shows an error page instead. The solution: To avoid weakening the user experience, a 301 redirect to a new URL may be helpful. That could be a redirect to the main category, the newer version of the product, or a similar product. Yet, if a product is sold out temporarily, a 302-redirect could also be used. It notifies the user that the redirect is only temporary. Suggestion: If you wish to deliberately display an error page, you should optimize your 404 page. When a user reaches this page, he not only receives an error message but also receives information on which products he can find instead. It is also possible to integrate a search function into the 404 error page. Figure 1: Search function on a 404 error page at Airbnb. Scenario 5: Relaunch of a Website with an URL Alteration If a website is at the top of search engine rankings before its relaunch, website operators will want to maintain its position. However, that should not be taken for granted. If the new site is simply launched without having made any preparations, old URLs are no longer accessible. A search engine indexes the exact URL of an individual web page, and if the structure of the website is changed, almost none of the web pages will keep their URL. The solution for the domain transfer: The old domain URL can be forwarded to the new domain URL via a 301 redirect. This way, users can be led directly to the new URL, without having to deal with error pages, or receiving browser messages that the complete website is unavailable. It is important to ensure all pages are correctly redirected. This is why all of the “old” URLs of the website must be captured before the relaunch: To assign them to the new domain. It is also important to continuously monitor the redirects after the relocation. If necessary, webmasters can quickly react and minimize ranking losses. Conclusion The canonical tag and the permanent 301 redirect are powerful tools that are not only useful to avoid duplicate content but can also be used to improve the user experience. Knowing when to use which, will ensure user satisfaction and positive results in search engines. Image Credits Featured Image: Image by OnPage.org. Used with permission. All screenshots by Irina Hey.

See our policy here.   Ali Raza Great effort Irina! I have found many folks talking about 30x redirects and canonical tags. You also have explained some scenarios regarding the usage of 301 and canonical tag. What about 301 vs 302? which is good? A post at link assistant have a section “301 redirects can prevent your pages from passing topical relevance” What’s your opinion on this? Does 301 redirect really prevent passing topical relevance? Shiva If I want to redirect from old page to new page which has same content then which redirect should i use canonical tag or 301 redirect. If I use canonical tag to redirect on which page should i implement this tag ? my preferred version is new page should i implement the canonical tag on new page or old page with new page url. Please reply your answer. Irina Hey Computergeekblog, The reason your traffic is decreasing after you redirected your post might be that your new post doesn’t match the search intention like the old one. You should dig deeper in your tracking solution and find out why your users appreciated your old post more than the new one. If you’re using WordPress and a redirect plugin, you don’t have to use the .htaccess for redirects. WordPress handles this all on its own. Shiva Hey Irina, Thanks for your reply, The problem with 301 redirect is we have already redirect our domain from non-www to www with .htaccess file which is present in our cpanel. I think their should be only one htaccess file in cpanel in the sense we cannot upload another file to redirect other pages. Can you explain me about this and what code need to be implemented in order to redirect from old page to new page. Thanks for the link.

Image: Sorbis/Shutterstock After months of scandals over the hazardous Galaxy Note7, Samsung is seeking redemption by announcing that the new Galaxy S8 will feature its own AI, assistant rather than relying on Google Now. It is hard to find anyone not familiar with the Galaxy Note7 scandal that saw the company ship thousands of potentially explosive devices to customers, resulting in a $6bn global recall and tanking profits in its mobile business. Still recovering, the South Korean giant will be pinning much of its hopes on the launch of the Galaxy S8 and its inclusion of a totally new AI assistant, according to Bloomberg. Until now, all Samsung phones have had to rely on the Google Now assistant found in the Android operating system. However, following the acquisition of Viv in October, Samsung will integrate its new technology into its next flagship phone. If the name Viv sounds familiar, it is because it was founded by Dag Kittlaus and Adam Cheyer, who were behind the development of Siri – Apple’s own AI-powered assistant on its devices. Scheduled to launch next year, Samsung has said that this new AI will be “significantly differentiated” from its rivals, particularly Siri and Google’s latest product, Google Assistant, first released on its latest Pixel phone. An assistant across multiple devices As a manufacturer of a multitude of appliances as well as phones, Samsung’s vice president Injong Rhee has said the technology it acquired in Viv will be used across all of its platforms, as part of the internet of things (IoT). While the Samsung Galaxy S7 received critical acclaim, the absence of a flagship phone to tide over potential customers until the launch of the S8 towards the end of next year will put considerable financial pressure on Samsung’s mobile business. In addition to this, trust in the company has been shaken again, as news emerged last week that another of Samsung’s devices has been found to be potentially dangerous. So far, the company has said it plans to recall up to 3m of its washing machines, which have been found to detach their tops during use, resulting in Samsung offering free repairs or replacements for newer customers.

Google also features a Street View integration.More With the release of J.K. Rowling’s upcoming Potterverse installment looming, Google is lettings its users become a part of the magic early. Ahead of the Nov. 18 release of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, Google’s voice assistant will let you cast certain Potter spells to interact with your phone and perform functions. In addition, the film features a Google Street View integration, allowing users to visit the world of the movie — 1926 New York City — and explore, just like you would in regular Street View fashion. Related: LeapDroid just made the leap over to Google The partnership between Google and Warner Brothers did not involve an exchange of money, TechCrunch reports, but Google declined to comment on the other terms of the deal. Through Google Now, by saying “OK Google,” users can cast Potter spells, like “Lumos,” which will immediately activate your phone’s flashlight application, or “Nox,” to turn the flashlight off. In addition, “Silencio,” will disable the device’s ringer and notifications. In the Street View integration, users can visit the Magical Congress of the USA (MACUSA), which Newt Scamander (played by Eddie Redmayne) explores in the new film, as well as an underground speakeasy called “The Blind Pig,” and the apartment of some of the main characters, Tina and Queenie Goldstein. Aside from Street View, Google will utilize its new Daydream View VR headset to allow users to interact more deeply in Newt Scamander’s world, solving puzzles, using his spell casting tools, and finding beasts. However, this feature will not become available until the Daydream View VR officially goes on sale. While the deal will surely promote the film for Warner Brothers, Google benefits by letting users experience the power of its Street View application and the Daydream View VR as soon as it comes out. Google will additionally be launching movie-themed Stickers in Google Allo, a move previously seen with Netflix’s Stranger Things this Halloween.

Photograph: Yui Mok/PA Alex Hern @alexhern Monday 7 November 2016 04.25 EST Last modified on Monday 7 November 2016 04.28 EST Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Google has been accused of hiding a competitor’s webmail service from its search results in a “suspicious” manner for almost a year, costing the service hundreds of thousands of pounds in lost traffic. The company, ProtonMail, provides encrypted email accounts for users, and has been one of the most popular services of that type since its launch in 2014, as reflected by its Google search ranking: the company says it was placed “on the first or second page of most [relevant] queries including ‘encrypted email’ and ‘secure email’”. In the autumn of 2015, however, ProtonMail’s ranking plummeted, from the first page to the fifth, tenth, and, by the following spring, nowhere visible at all. “All throughout spring 2016, we worked in earnest to get in touch with Google,” the company says. “We created two tickets on their web spam report form explaining the situation. We even contacted Google’s president of EMEA strategic relationships, but received no response nor improvement.” The result of the collapse was ProtonMail’s growth rate dropping by a quarter for the affected months, something the company estimates cost it “several hundred thousand Swiss Francs”. In the end, it tried going semi-public, sending tweets to Google directly accusing the company of “intentionally hiding ProtonMail from search results”. ProtonMail (@ProtonMail) @google @mattcutts We know Google is intentionally hiding ProtonMail from search results. Interested in talking before our data goes public? August 5, 2016 ProtonMail (@ProtonMail) @google @mattcutts Even if it's not intentional, we have data that proves it's a major bug. All previous contact attempts have been ignored. August 5, 2016 That seemed to work, sparking a reply from Google’s then-head of webspam, Matt Cutts. MonsterMatt Cutts (@mattcutts) @ProtonMail @googlewmc @brianwhite I believe the complaint got in front of the right folks. Let me check to see what the latest is. August 9, 2016 “After a few days,” ProtonMail writes, “Google informed us that they had ‘fixed something’ without providing further details. The results could be immediately seen.” The company’s site returned to the first page of results, where it has stayed ever since. One potential cause of the collapse in ranking could be ProtonMail’s site moving domains, from protonmail.ch to protonmail.com. Such transfers can cause the collected authority attributed to the site to be lost, forcing site owners to start afresh. But regardless of the cause, ProtonMail argues that the event demonstrated the existence of “search risk”. “The danger is that any service such as ProtonMail can easily be suppressed by either search companies, or the governments that control those search companies,” it writes. “This can happen even across national borders. For example, even though Google is an American company, it controls over 90% of European search traffic.” “This episode illustrates that search risk is serious, which is why we now agree with the European Commission that given Google’s dominant position in search, more transparency and oversight is critical,” it added. Google declined to comment, but confirmed to the Guardian that after ProtonMail’s report it was able to find and fix something affecting the search results.

Home Latest News Popular news National International Business Sports Entertainment Science/Tech Environment Feature Bahasa Full Site Govt to collect taxes from Google this year Senin, 7 November 2016 15:56 WIB - 0 Views id govt, taxes google, this year Jakarta (ANTARA News) - Director General of Taxes of the Ministry of Finance Ken Dwijugiasteadi said the government will collect taxes from Google this year, after completing its inspection of the United States multinational companys financial statements. "It should be collected starting from this year. It should be carried out after finishing the examination," Ken said on the sidelines of the 10th National Leadership Meeting of the Taxation Directorate General of the Ministry of Finance on Monday. The process includes a discussion of the final results of the examination or closing conference. The two sides will make a statement about the amount of taxes Google should pay to the government. The Tax Directorate General has monitored the taxes of Google, Twitter, Facebook or Yahoo since April 2016 to explore potential receipts from the information technology businesses, which have been growing rapidly. According to the Directorate General of Taxation, Google in Indonesia has been registered as a legal entity in the country in the Tanah Abang III Tax Service Office (KPP) with a foreign investment company (PMA) status since 15 September 2011, and is a dependent agent of Google Asia Pacific Pte Ltd. in Singapore. Accordingly, pursuant to Article (2) paragraph (5) letter (N) of the Income Tax Law, Google should have been included as a BUT (permanent establishment) company whose income from Indonesia is subject to tax. However, Google has refused any tax audits by the Indonesian tax authorities and rejected to be included as a company with the BUT status, though Googles revenues from Indonesia reach trillions of rupiah, primarily from advertising. Last September, The Communication and Informatics Ministry urged Google to pay tax in Indonesia and set up a permanent establishment just as the US-based technology provider has done in several other countries. "We have told Google to apply the same norms in Indonesia (as it did in India or Brazil). Googles revenues from Indonesia and advertisements targeted at Indonesia are taxable. Google is expected to set up a permanent establishment in Indonesia," Noor Iza Noor, acting head of the ministrys public relations department, said according to the ministrys website. Google leaders consider Indonesia important for the company, just as India and Brazil are; so Google should apply the same principles in terms of transactions and taxes, he added. He noted that Google has had a permanent establishment in India and paid taxes which are quite high. "We hope Google will be wise in business and will apply the principle of equality. Transactions should not be pooled only in certain countries, while disadvantaging other countries that spend on Google," he argued. Digital ads spending in Indonesia in 2016 is estimated to increase significantly to more than US$1 billion. The Tax Directorate General of the Indonesian Finance Ministry has asked Google to pay taxes in the country. Google has refused to be inspected and also to be considered as a business entity subject to taxes.

You might love Gmail, but you have to suffer through targeted ads; you may enjoy using Google Maps, but you have to give up your location privacy. Signing up for Google's suite of apps almost always involves some degree of data collection, but you should at least try to limit the amount of spying the company performs on you. Here's how you can keep using Google's apps without constantly getting spied on. Signing out of your account Some of Google's tools, such as Google Maps and Google search, can be used without a Google account through your web browser. Either sign out or open up an incognito browser window before accessing them and Google can't link your search activities with the profile it has on you. Of course you miss out on some of the personalizations and benefits you get with signing in (like starred places on Maps), but if you want to fly under the radar for a while, this is one of the simplest ways to do it. The same trick works in the mobile browser on your phone, though the experience isn't quite as slick or straightforward as it is in the equivalent mobile app. A lot of Google apps do require a signed in user however, like Gmail or Google Drive, so you're out of luck there. Turn off activity tracking Head to the activity controls page inside your Google account on the web and it's possible to switch off all kinds of tracking if you're not comfortable with it. The available options cover YouTube searching and viewing history, web searching history, location history, voice searching history, web and app activity, and device information, which covers data about the status of your mobile devices and their key apps. If you're not sure what any of these activity logs include, you can view them from the same screen, and delete individual entries if you need to. You can't turn everything off (Google still auto-scans your Gmail, for example), but you can put limits on the data collected about your web searches, location history, and more. Say you don't want Google Now remembering everything you've said to it. Turn the Voice & Audio Activity toggle switch to off, and after you've clicked through the confirmation dialog, you're set. As with the other activity categories, if you want to clear data Google's already stored, follow the Manage Activity link. The same options can be accessed on mobile. On Android, head to Settings and tap Google then Personal info & privacy; on iOS, open the Google app to find a more limited set of privacy controls. Customize Google's ads Google shows you ads in order to keep its services free of charge, but you should at least customize the kind of ads you see to get the most from them. Again you need to take a trip to your Google account portal, this time the ads settings page. You can turn advertising personalization on or off, which won't affect the number of ads you see, but will affect how targeted they are. While this doesn't really affect the data Google collects on you, it means it can't be used as widely. If you're happy seeing personalized ads that are (theoretically) more relevant to you, you can adjust the topics they cover through the list further down the page. These topics come from educated guesses by Google but you can easily delete them or add new ones. Of course in many of these areas there's a balance to strike between convenience and privacy. If you want Google to automatically show you directions to your favorite noodle bar before you search for it, then you're going to have to put up with some personalized ads too. Google's Privacy Policy and details of its data collection are available online.

Buz Investors Great News for Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Google stock may be ready to make a huge splash in the phone market as a new report shows "Android" phone sales dominating globally. Eighty-eight percent of the 375 million new smartphones shipped worldwide were running an Android operating system, according to a new report from Strategy Analytics. With Apple Inc.'s(NASDAQ:AAPL)"iOS" platform and Android accounting for 97.3% of the worldwide smartphone market share, Google continually looks to place its new smartphone offering, "Pixel," in opposition to Apple's "iPhone." Great News for Alphabet Loving the Smartphone Market Eighty-eight percent of the 375 million new smartphones shipped worldwide were running an Android operating system, according to a new report from Strategy Analytics. With Apple Inc.'s(NASDAQ:AAPL)"iOS" platform and Android accounting for 97.3% of the worldwide smartphone market share, Google continually looks to place its new smartphone offering, "Pixel," in opposition to Apple's "iPhone." Google has released several challenges to the mainstay Apple product, including a video on "YouTube" of how to switch over to a Pixel from an iPhone, pushing for reviews comparing the two devices' high-powered cameras, and otherwise trying to provoke confrontation between the two types of smartphones, in an effort to present Pixel as the alternative to the iPhone. (Source: "#Pixel Tips: Switching from iPhone," Google Youtube channel, October 26, 2016.) Apple's iPhones simply don't offer any models at an attractive price point for the global market, while Android phones benefit from the ability to produce affordable phones for a global audience, which accounts for their global market domination. The drawback is that, of the hundreds of manufacturers producing smartphones, many are money-losers, including big-name brands likeHTC Corporation and LG Electronics Inc. (Source: "Apple iPhone Grabs 104% Of Smartphone Industry Profit In Q3," Investors Business Daily, November 3, 2016.) Apple, on the other hand, continues to dominate the smartphone arena in terms of profit, accounting for 103.6% of the smartphone industry's operating profits in the third quarter. Emerging markets across the world are likely to spur growth for the foreseeable future, even if it is at a decreased rate. India and Indonesia, in particular, might be major players in the smartphone market due to their developing economies and high population growth. This article was written by Richard Dambrosi for on .

But before you get to the ballot box -- and head out with that sticker! -- check Google to get the information on where to vote and election results. Starting when the polls close on Election Day, you will be able to find U.S. election results integrated right into your Google searches in over 30 languages around the world. You’ll also be able to see detailed updates and results of the Presidential, Senatorial, Congressional, Gubernatorial races as well as state-level referenda and ballot propositions. For the past several months, Google has helped people find information about the democratic process: our search results have helped voters register and explained the voting process with information on how to vote, who’s on their ballot, and how to find their local polling place in both English and Spanish. Since releasing these in-depth search results, we've seen millions of people engage with these tools on Google -- there's even been a startling 233% increase in traffic for "how to vote" compared with 2012. In addition to “how to vote,” Americans are actively searching for “where to vote” -- particularly in battleground states, as depicted in these county-by-county breakdowns: Over the past few weeks viewers spent over 20 million hours watching - and rewatching - the presidential debate live streams on YouTube. Tomorrow, YouTube will be live streaming election results coverage from more news organizations than ever before. Starting at 7 p.m. ET on Tuesday, November 8, tune in to live coverage from NBC, PBS, MTV, Bloomberg, Telemundo and The Young Turks to keep up with all of the action as it happens. Complex News will also be delivering live coverage during a special election event from YouTube Space NY. And to close out YouTube’s #voteIRL campaign, creators and fans have been posting their #voteIRL selfie to mark that they’re going to vote. And tune in to some special voting reminder PSAs starring POTUS and some familiar-looking furry friends. Whether you voted early, plan to head to the polls tomorrow, host an Election Night watch party, or live stream the victory speech from America’s new President-Elect, we’re here to help. From the ballot box to tomorrow’s late-night returns, we hope Google’s tools help guide you through Election Day in a simple, clear and informative way. And one last thing: don’t forget to vote. It matters. http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/blogspot/MKuf/~3/Ev5SVDXEVJI/ Categories: SciTech World Media Media News Computers and Internet Middle East Tags: Google search engine search Politics & Elections YouTube MOST VIEWED ARTICLES Victims Of Childhood Bullying More ...

Google Pixel XL vs iPhone 7: Which smartphone camera is better? Google Pixel XL and iPhone 7 camera shootout: Check out what the two deliver in terms of photography. Written by Shruti Dhapola | Updated: November 8, 2016 2:25 pm Apple iPhone 7 in matte black next to the Google Pixel XL in Silver colour: So which is the better smartphone camera? Best premium smartphone, Android king, and the best camera ever on a smartphone: Google Pixel is getting all sorts of accolades. With the Note 7 now dead, Samsung doesn’t really have a new flagship for the rest of 2016. And the iPhone 7 doesn’t look much of an upgrade, except for maybe the matte black colour option which is gorgeous. When it comes to flagship phones, cameras are a key defining feature. The Samsung Galaxy S7 edge is considered one of the best in the business thanks to its camera’s low-light performance. With the iPhone 7, Apple claims improved low-light performance thanks to a wider aperture and has made OIS standard. On the other hand, there’s the iPhone 7 Plus which offers a dual lens set-up, an option for DSLR-style Portrait/Bokeh mode. But Google Pixel and Pixel XL are topping all of this with their 12.3 MP lens and no OIS; these phones rely on EIS instead. Personally, I have been an iPhone user since the time of 5c; my iPhone 6s has been my one and only device for photography on vacations, trips, and during coverage of technology events. And it has delivered in most cases. In bright sunlight and clear blue skies (something we are not going to see in Delhi anytime soon), the iPhone doesn’t have a competitor. On most of my sunny vacations, the iPhone 5c and 6s have managed excellent shots. And one of the reasons for upgrading or not upgrading to the next iPhone is always around the camera.

I’ve been using both phones extensively for the past couple of weeks. Honestly, both phones are pretty close to each other in terms of camera performance. I have uploaded some of the comparison pictures below, but do note these have been resized for the web. Also, the iPhone 7 has a different colour profile (wide colour gamut DCI-P3) on the display, which means there is difference in how these pictures look on the actual phone compared to a desktop screen, regular mobile display, etc. I felt the difference when I had to crop/reduce image size for uploading on the web. Personally, I’m not a fan of big phones, which is another reason why the iPhone 7, 6s, etc appeal to someone like me. But this particular vacation, I found myself constantly reaching for the Pixel XL, and ditching the iPhone 7. This is not to say the iPhone 7 doesn’t deliver in photos, it is just the Pixel XL comes very close thanks to the software wizardry that Google is doing with the phone’s camera. While with the iPhone 7, I like that the colour tones are more muted, more natural, but there were moments where the Pixel XL left it far behind. In my daily use, the Pixel XL was much faster than the iPhone 7 when it came to focus and taking a shot; in the former’s case the post processing HDR+ takes a couple of seconds. For instance, the below shot of pictures are taken from a moving boat; the Pixel XL makes the sky a lot more blue, while the iPhone 7 has got the it closer to the natural colour when it comes to the lake water. In low-light, the Google Pixel XL has a tendency to over-process some of the images, and yes they do look brighter, though once you zoom in on the edges, there is noise. The iPhone 7 goes with more muted colours tones, but that doesn’t mean it is missing out on details either. In case of the bell photo, I could zoom in and still see the texture on the iPhone 7. On the Pixel XL, the picture looks much brighter and might appeal to most people, and the details like the scratches on the bell are much more clearly visible. In most low-light cases, I came to depend on the Pixel XL, even though some of the picture look a tad too bright. Also both phones deliver quite well when it comes to taking macro-style shots in proper lighting. Again the difference comes down to the colour tones, though both capture sharp details. So which is the best camera smartphone in the market out there? As iPhone 6s user, I’m yet to find a compelling reason to upgrade to the iPhone 7. I’m waiting to see what happens with the iPhone 8. But both iPhone 7 and Google Pixel XL are two of the best smartphone cameras in the market. The Pixel XL has a software advantage in low-light for those who love brighter, more vivid colour tones. In my mind, there’s no doubt the Pixel is the right competitor for the iPhone 7’s camera. © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd Express TechIE Samsung Galaxy S7 Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 Gionee S6 Xiaomi Mi 5 Best of Express 26/11 Stories of Strength presented by The Indian Express, Facebook & Instagram IndiaChill sets in early: Oppn moves to corner Govt, PM Modi hits back, says his decision troubles them IndiaKadak like my chai, rich don’t like it: PM Modi on demonetisation IndiaNo regrets, but govt addressing inconvenience, says Venkaiah Naidu IndiaPakistan says seven of its troops killed in Indian fire at LoC IndiaPanama Papers: 415 Indians under scanner as probe widens EntertainmentIn Bigg Boss 10, Bani is the most selfish contestant: Navin Prakash opens up after eviction EntertainmentKoffee With Karan 5: Twinkle Khanna's shocking revelations on the KJo's show EntertainmentITA Awards 2016: Mouni Roy, Shabbir Ahluwalia emerge big winners, see pics, video EntertainmentSalman Khan is spoiling nephew Ahil and Arpita Khan Sharma has proof, see pics Must Read SportsIndia vs England: Slow to adopt, now learning on the job SportsBCCI gets Lodha approval to pay Rajasthan players SportsRanji Trophy 2016: More brain than brawn TechnologyDemonetisation: Now, a tool to find ATMs with money across India TechnologySamsung Galaxy S8, Galaxy Note 8 model numbers leaked TechnologyDemonetisation effect: Here's how to sign-up for Paytm, Mobikwik and use the e-wallets  Guru Nanak Jayanti 2016: India celebrates Gurpurab with great fanfare Nov 15: Latest News Punjabis react to Trump’s decision to deport illegal immigrants: ‘May affect economy, hit unscrupulous travel agents’ Securities and Exchange Commission Chair leaving at end of Obama administration INLD hits out at Congress, BJP for ‘doublespeak’ Punjab, Haryana should resolve SYL issue amicably: BJP union minister Narendra Singh Tomar Ahead of special session, Speaker Charanjit Singh Atwal yet to accept Cong MLAs’ resignation Shruti DhapolaLooking at technology and web culture.... read more Asus Zenfone 3 Laser review: Good phone, but pricey for its specs Fake news and how it is killing democracy through social media timelines Rs 500, Rs 1,000 notes gone: Paytm to MobiKwik, digital wallets are rejoicing                           The Express Group The Indian Express The Financial Express Loksatta Jansatta inUth Ramnath Goenka Awards Privacy Policy Advertise with Us Contact Us Subscribe Please reload and try again !!!

The Indian Express Nation World Opinion Entertainment Lifestyle Technology Viral Photos Videos E-Paper Apps RSS Home Compare News Mobile & Tabs Gadgets Science Indian Express Home Home Technology Tech News Samsung Galaxy S8’s AI-based assistant will go beyond smartphones Samsung Galaxy S8’s AI-based assistant will go beyond smartphones Samsung Galaxy S8 will see the launch of a new AI-powered personal assistant on the smartphone. By: Tech Desk | Updated: November 7, 2016 4:21 pm Samsung Galaxy S8 will come with its own AI-powered personal assistant. (Source: Reuters) Personal assistants powered by artificial intelligence and machine learning are the next big thing on smartphones. Sure Siri might have existed on the iPhone since the time of the 4s, and Cortana was big on Microsoft Windows Mobile, while Google Now offered to do much of the same as well. And Samsung had something called S-Voice on its premium Galaxy phones. But now it looks like Samsung is preparing to revamp Artificial intelligence on its smartphones, and the next flagship, the Galaxy S8 will ship with its own such platform. Samsung plans to apply this to its home appliances as well, according to reports. This is a pretty announcement if you consider that Google has also jumped into smartphone arena with its own #MadeByGoogle Pixel and Pixel XL phones. And Google Assistant is going to be exclusive to these phones for sometime. According to Lee Jae-yong, Samsung Electronics’ vice chairman, the company will use its new acquisition Viv Labs to help provide the right assistant experience for users. Viv Labs was co-founded by the same team that built Siri, Apple’s own personal Assistant. A report in Korean Herald quotes Samsung’s Vice President Rhee In-jong as saying, “The current Galaxy smartphones need separate applications for users, for instance, to order pizza or coffee. But, the new AI platform will enable them to order (or do) things directly without going through separate applications.” J&K Schools: Amid Shutdown, Restrictions, Board Examinations Begin Ghazipur: PM Modi Flags Off Shabd Bhedi Express Ghazipur: PM Modi Promises To Open Files Of Patel Committee This Is How People Celebrate Guru Nanak Jayanti Nation Celebrates Guru Nanak Jayanti Demonetisation: Brinda Karat Calls PM Modi’s Speech ‘Drama’ Vizag Police Nabs Prisoners Escaped From Warangal Central Jail Demonetisation Will Affect Fashion Industry Only In Short Run, Feels Designer Sabyasachi New Zealand: Two Killed In 7.8 Magnitude Earthquake Demonetisation: Banking Correspondents Can Withdraw Cash Multiple Times, Says Shaktikanta Das PM Modi Claims Demonetisation Has Left Corrupts With ‘No Option’ Golfer Aditi Ashok becomes first Indian Woman to lift European Tour Event PM Modi at KLE: Win gold medals for India in 2020 Olympics Idea Exchange With Ujjal Dosanjh India Manage A Draw After Anxious Day 5 “Developers can attach and upload services to our agent,” said Rhee In-jong during a briefing, according to Reuters. “Even if Samsung doesn’t do anything on its own, the more services that get attached the smarter this agent will get, learn more new services and provide them to end-users with ease.” Samsung’s AI platform sounds very similar to how Google Assistant is tailored; learn overtime and improve. Also read: Google Assistant is Pixel exclusive, but there’s a way to get it on your phone Samsung plans to make it one big connected technology, which will also power internet of things devices. For instance, the assistant will also work on a Samsung smart fridge, and connect with the phone, according to the report. Samsung acquired Viv in October, which has sparked interest on how the company plans to use this in the future. Viv on its part is an open artificial intelligence (AI) platform where third-party app developers can also build conversational assistants and integrate a natural language-based interface in existing applications and services. Samsung’s decision to go for its own AI platform in the future flagship phone comes at a time when the big players in tech are all focusing on artificial intelligence as the next big thing. Google has a significant advantage in this given how dependent majority of the smartphone population is on Android and other Google services. Google Assistant for instance relies on machine learning; what this means is that overtime it can figure out a user’s habits, style of typing etc, and give them exactly what it need. The Assistant is also part of Google’s Allo app. Just like Siri in Apple now has third-party integration, Google plans to bring this as well. On Siri, users can order an Uber or look up reservations or order food. Then there’s Amazon Echo, which is powered by its Alexa assistant. Alexa can stream music, book an Uber, even order items from Amazon. In case of Apple, Siri is now available on platforms: iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS all have Siri. Samsung which has a wider array of consumer electronics will make sure that its new personal Assistant powers all its smart devices. For now Google is clear leader in AI, but it looks like all other players also want to strengthen their AI offerings. © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd Tags: Samsung Express TechIE Samsung Galaxy S7 Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 Gionee S6 Xiaomi Mi 5 Best of Express 26/11 Stories of Strength presented by The Indian Express, Facebook & Instagram IndiaChill sets in early: Oppn moves to corner Govt, PM Modi hits back, says his decision troubles them IndiaKadak like my chai, rich don’t like it: PM Modi on demonetisation IndiaNo regrets, but govt addressing inconvenience, says Venkaiah Naidu IndiaPakistan says seven of its troops killed in Indian fire at LoC IndiaPanama Papers: 415 Indians under scanner as probe widens EntertainmentIn Bigg Boss 10, Bani is the most selfish contestant: Navin Prakash opens up after eviction EntertainmentKoffee With Karan 5: Twinkle Khanna's shocking revelations on the KJo's show EntertainmentITA Awards 2016: Mouni Roy, Shabbir Ahluwalia emerge big winners, see pics, video EntertainmentSalman Khan is spoiling nephew Ahil and Arpita Khan Sharma has proof, see pics Must Read SportsIndia vs England: Slow to adopt, now learning on the job SportsBCCI gets Lodha approval to pay Rajasthan players SportsRanji Trophy 2016: More brain than brawn TechnologyDemonetisation: Now, a tool to find ATMs with money across India TechnologySamsung Galaxy S8, Galaxy Note 8 model numbers leaked TechnologyDemonetisation effect: Here's how to sign-up for Paytm, Mobikwik and use the e-wallets  Guru Nanak Jayanti 2016: India celebrates Gurpurab with great fanfare Nov 15: Latest News Punjabis react to Trump’s decision to deport illegal immigrants: ‘May affect economy, hit unscrupulous travel agents’ Securities and Exchange Commission Chair leaving at end of Obama administration INLD hits out at Congress, BJP for ‘doublespeak’ Punjab, Haryana should resolve SYL issue amicably: BJP union minister Narendra Singh Tomar Ahead of special session, Speaker Charanjit Singh Atwal yet to accept Cong MLAs’ resignation                           The Express Group The Indian Express The Financial Express Loksatta Jansatta inUth Ramnath Goenka Awards Privacy Policy Advertise with Us Contact Us Subscribe Please reload and try again !!!

Enter your search terms Submit search form       Home | About Us | Sample Press Release   Press Release Articles | Press Releases and SEO | Press Release Book     A Website Is Not Just A Digital Poster Says New Digital Marketing Agency   View as PDF  Print View    Many local businesses today offer excellent products and services, but find marketing their Achilles heel. One can't be an expert in everything, a fact that has inspired Boom My Biz to launch its new website and customised online marketing services. Glasgow, United Kingdom - November 7, 2016 /MarketersMedia/ -- Boom My Biz help local businesses in Glasgow and worldwide to flourish online through well planned email and video marketing, web design, SEO and Google My Business presence. Boom My Biz knows that successful marketing is where local and small businesses struggle due to lack of expertise, finances or time. It thus designs solutions that are more effective than traditional ways of spreading the word out, in less time and expenditure. Many aspects of a business website or its marketing initiatives are not optimized to yield the greatest benefit. Boom My Biz wishes to change all this for the better. Email marketing can work wonders if the target list is well sourced and its content received ready to be used. Boom My Biz collects contacts of local target audience who are relevant for a business, and then engages with subscribers with readymade newsletters, special offers and product features. This service is ideal for businesses such as retailers, spas and restaurants. Google My Business (GMB) is an essential weapon in the Boom My Biz portfolio. With GMB, local businesses are in for a special treat, as their brands and locations show up on the first page of Google results. A Google+ page, optimized with citations and schema data, allows branding, updates and customer reviews that add legitimacy and trust for potential customers. If local businesses want to see more footfalls and hear the cash register ring more often, search engine optimization holds the clues. The first page of Google search results is where the action begins, and Boom My Biz claim to know how to work it out with competitor research, website health audits, keyword research, powerful backlinking and mobile optimization. With quality content added, local or global businesses can gain more clients, sell more or get more subscribers.

Wall Street has just posted its best day since the start of March, as the closing bell brings today’s rally to a halt. Predictions of a Hillary Clinton election victory have cheered the markets, ending a nine-day losing streak. The Dow Jones industrial average jumped by 371 points, or 2.08%, with the S&P 500 gaining 2.1%. The tech stock-heavy Nasdaq index gained almost 2.5%, as investors piled back into shares.

Chris Beauchamp of IG says we’ve seen a buying stampede today: According to the IG binary market, IG clients think Hillary remains the favourite, with her chances of election holding at 81%.* US assets have been heavily bid throughout the day, as the nine-day selloff is banished to distant memory. With around 36 hours to go until the result becomes known, there is plenty of potential for upsets however, and we may see the bullish move falter tomorrow if the battleground states remain in close contention. As we’ve been covering in this blog since early morning, the FBI’s decision to clear Hillary Clinton over her email server has given the Democratic candidate a last-minute lift. But.... this race is not over, even if some investors are acting like Clinton is home and dry. Key states such as Florida, North Caroline and Pennsylvania will determine who wins the White House. And the word from the campaign trials is that the race is still tight. Here’s a flavour of our latest news story: The US presidential campaign ended on Monday where the fiercest nomination battles began – in the rustbelt – as Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump spent the last hours of a bitter election focused on the country’s deep economic divide. Democrats gained a late confidence boost as a final series of national opinion polls confirmed a small but steady lead for Clinton. Early voting numbers point already to record turnout among Latino voters stirred into action by Trump’s anti-immigration rhetoric. But the continued risk of an upset that would send shockwaves around the world was underlined by state-level polling suggesting several possible paths to victory also remain for Trump. He hopes to galvanise white working-class anger over jobs and trade in the traditionally Democratic manufacturing regions, though also needs an almost clean sweep of battleground states including Florida and North Carolina to win outright. Sensing possible danger, the Clinton campaign poured last-minute resources into the industrial midwest, a region where she struggled against a similar anti-establishment surge for Bernie Sanders during the primary election season. Both Clinton and Barack Obama held afternoon rallies in Michigan before planning to finish the night on stage together in Philadelphia with Bruce Springsteen....

Broadband performance has been falling with every passing year and increased connectivity. Internet Service Providers (ISPs) operate as local monopolies which allows them to have highly restrictive data limits. The most restrictive FUP plans in the world are in Papua New Guinea, Vietnam and India. FUP and data caps simply have to go for meaningful broadband connectivity in India. The Digital India initiative is in a strong position to take effective steps to remedy the situation. Quality of broadband in India is lower than local and global levels Digital India is a pet project by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, intended to bring about rapid transformation in the most marginalised sections of the society. He pitched his mission for Digital India in a meeting with CEOs of major tech companies, he addressed Adobe CEO Shantanu Narayan, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, Qualcomm executive chairman Paul Jacobs, Fcaebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Google CEO Sundar Pichai. PM Modi said that building connectivity was as important as building roads, “We will connect all schools and colleges with broadband. Building I—ways are as important as highways” Modi with Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg Since the meetings, there have been a series of developments where major tech companies have contributed to the Digital India mission. Cisco unveiled a $60 million investment plan for India which included conferences and training programs. Nagpur was selected for conversion into a smart city, with Cisco providing the infrastructure for a citywide network with integrated Wi-Fi hotspots and surveillance technologies. Cisco is going beyond just smart cities, with a Smart Villages plan as well, with the first pilot project in Fetri village in Nagpur discrict. As part of the Digital Maharashtra vision, Cisco is contributing to the statewide deployment of broadband infrastructure. Google has tied up with the communications arm of the Indian Railways, RailTel, to roll out public wi-fi hotspots in Railway stations across India. “We are working with the Indian Railways and RailTel to bring high-speed wireless access to the entire Internet to millions of Indians who travel through India’s top railway stations,” Indian born Google CEO Sundar Pichai said in an Investors call. At the second edition of the Google for India event, Google launched Google Stations, an India specific initiative for providing high speed wireless broadband connectivity in not only Indian Railway stations but also public spaces. Google intends to roll out Wi-Fi hotspots in 100 stations by the end of 2016. Google Stations has 15,000 new users connecting up every day, with an active user base of 3.5 million every month. Google further announced plans to extend connectivity in schools, restaurants, shops and malls. Google intends to partner with location and venue owners to set up public Wi-Fi hotspots across the country. Smart Cities, IoT and Connected Cars will all need high speed broadband. Credit: Trai High speed connectivity is required for providing healthcare, banking, e-governance and education to the underserved. However, the ubiquitous broadband will also be required to support smart cities, connected cars and the internet of things. Qualcomm has set up an India specific venture firm with US $150 million (approximately Rs 9.8 billion) earmarked to encourage innovative new startups in India. The fund will focus on mobile and internet of things based startups. Mukesh Ambani at the Reliance AGM Reliance Jio plans to provide high speed 1 Gbps broadband services to 100 cities in India. The rollout will be one of the largest high speed networks in the world. Even BSNL provides 100 Mbps plus broadband speeds in only 97 cities across India. If successful, this ambitious rollout will revolutionise internet access in India. Current gigabit speeds in India cost two or three times as much as the plans available globally. During Reliance Industries’ AGM announcement, Mukesh Ambani said, “Data is the oxygen of digital life and oxygen must never be in short supply.” Satya Nadella, the first Indian-American CEO of Microsoft. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella announced that Microsoft would be working to bring low cost broadband access to 500,000 villages in India in partnership with the Digital India program. “We believe that low-cost broad band connectivity coupled with the scale of cloud computing intelligence that can be harnessed from data can help drive creativity, efficiency and productivity across governments and businesses of all sizes,” Nadella said. Microsoft also announced local hosting of cloud services at the same event. Ambassador Daniel Sepulveda. Image: US Department of State. Major tech companies from the United States see India as the next big market, especially with the large chunk of population still to get online. A senior US official committed to sharing expertise with the Digital India program on the side lines of an US-India Cyber Dialogue. US Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Daniel Sepulveda said “We share common interests and US has its expertise to share. We will share our best practices between the regulators.” MIT President L. Rafael Reif. Image: MIT. Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) President Rafael Reif visited Prime Minister Narendra Modi in January this year. A part of the discussion was an on expertise and knowledge transfer. The possibility of senior or retired MIT professors coming to teach in India was discussed. Modi asked for the use of MIT expertise in the Digital India program, an option that Reif was appreciative about, and offered his assistance to. Telecom Minister Manoj Sinha Speaking at a connectivity seminar, Telecom Minister Manoj Sinha outlined the challenges for Digital India, and stressed that innovative techniques are needed to overcome these hurdles. He called for a holistic approach to tackle the problem, rather than taking care of it in small bits. He revealed that the Finance Ministry was conservative of allocating funds to the Universal Service Obligation Fund, a program to deliver connectivity to rural populations, even though the funds were available. Sinha announced that over Rs 10,000 crore will be spent between 2016 and 2017 for boosting connectivity infrastructure in rural areas. NOFN Concept Diagram. Image: BBNL. The National Optical Fibre Network is an initiative to connect all the 2,50,000 Gram Panchayats in the country. BSNL, Railtel and the Power Grid are being used to extend the connectivity. The cost of the NOFN project is Rs 20,000 crore and is expected to be completed by 2017. SWAN Concept Diagram. Image: MEITY. The State Wide Area Network was an initiative with  Rs 2,005 crore allocated for establishing high speed connections between State and Union Territory headquarters and the block or district level headquarters. There has been successful roll-out of the SWANs in all states except the Andaman Islands and Jammu and Kashmir. Swan integration with the National Knowledge Network is under way now. In the Digital India program, the Broadband Highways form the first and most important pillar, the central support for all the other technologies. The National Information Infrastructure plan is an effort to integrate State Wide Area Networks (SWAN), the National Knowledge Network (NKN), National Optical Fibre Network (NOFN), Government User Network (GUN) and Meghraj Cloud. The Digital India program is driving investments in Information Technology by the government. According to Gartner, the Indian Government is expected to invest $7 billion on IT products and services in 2016, 3.1 percent increase over the previous year. Consulting, support, BPOs and IT outsourcing businesses are expected to grow because of the Digital India Program.

As if the Galaxy Note 7 burning fiasco wasn’t enough, there is now news of even its washing machines exploding. According to a Reuters report, Samsung has stated that it will be recalling about 2.8 million top-load washing machines in the US. Samsung has clearly a lot riding on its upcoming flagships to do some damage control. On Sunday, Samsung said that it will be launching its own artificial intelligence-backed digital assistant service which will be baked into its upcoming Galaxy S8 flagship smartphone. Just like Google and Apple, Samsung has said that its voice-assistant will work across home appliances and wearable tech devices as well. Samsung needs something beyond incremental updates in Galaxy S8 Microsoft and Google have developed their artificial intelligence-backed assistants in-house. Apple had acquired Siri, which was an iPhone app back in 2010, before integrating it into its iOS and now macOS ecosystems. Samsung seems to be treading on a similar path. It recently acquired Viv Labs Inc, a San Jose-based AI company which will be powering its digital assistant. Viv Labs Inc was founded in 2012 by Dag Kittlaus, Adam Cheyer and Chris Brigham — the same trio who were the original creators of Siri. Samsung seems to be wasting no time on the virtual assistant front, as that is clearly becoming a playground for prominent tech players. After Google baked Assistant into its Pixel devices and with Apple already having Siri, it just seems logical for Samsung to have something up its sleeves as well. Even Amazon has Alexa on its Echo home assistant. Assistant on the Google Pixel After the PR disaster that was the Note 7, Samsung clearly needs something compelling at its next major device launch. Mere incremental updates in the next flagship smartphone is definitely not going to cut it. In such a scenario, the announcement of its own digital assistant, has certainly garnered interest. The duopoly of Apple and Samsung, will clearly be challenged now that Google has entered the ring with its Pixel lineup. For all practical purposes, Google is now in competition with Samsung in the premium smartphone segment. But, Google has Assistant. Apple has Siri. Samsung has nothing similar, so far. Considering Samsung has a variety of devices which tie in with its smartphones, relying completely on third party assistants would not have been the smartest move. So Samsung did the next best thing. It bought Viv. Why Viv’s acquisition is a step in the right direction Post the acquisition, the pricing details of which are not available, Viv CEO Dag Kittlaus said that Samsung is going to offer Viv a single conversational interface to multiple apps and services, across products, at a global scale. So it is safe to assume, that just like Google’s Assistant, Samsung’s digital assistant will be device-agnostic. Kittlaus had given a live demo of Viv earlier this year at the TechCrunch Disrupt conference. Safe to say, that at first glance the Viv looks far superior to the existing virtual assistants. The two main features of Viv are: third-party apps integration and the ability of its AI to create programs on the fly after understanding the intent of the user. While the former is a feature offered by Siri, Cortana and Assistant, the latter is something interesting that gives Viv, and in effect Samsung, an edge. The scope is far wider than just smartphones According to Kittlaus, Samsung offers scale across its product portfolio as well as the sheer number of devices it sells, for Viv to be out there. Back in 2014, Samsung had acquired SmartThings, a smart-home appliances startup which helped connect household devices. This is the list of SmartThings product portfolio.  Amazon’s Echo and Google’s Home, are both belong in the home appliances segment, but are essentially vessels for both these companies’ virtual assistants. Samsung’s Viv acquisition opens up the possibility for a similar device from Samsung as well. Add in the fact that Samsung has other smart appliances such as smart TVs, smart refrigerators, smart washing machines and Viv has a significantly larger playground. We are looking at a scale of smart hardware products, that is more than Apple, Google and Microsoft combined. When asked why Viv has decided to work with Samsung, Kittlaus said, “We realised back then (when we formed Viv) then that this is just the beginning of a much bigger story. So in order to have a real assistant, you need to have an assistant that gets to know you, it needs to be on every kind of device. One thing missing from that picture was scale. So, when we met Samsung, we realised that our visions were so aligned and the possibilities were so large to take this vision and accelerate it.” We all know the fate of Samsung’s in-house software products such as badaOS and Tizen. Instead of making a digital assistant from scratch, Viv’s acquisition just makes a lot of sense as not only does it cut down the time required for Samsung to get on board the digital assistant bandwagon. But also offer it at a segment-agnostic scale, that Google, Microsoft and Apple can only dream about. Samsung knows that there is a lot riding on the Galaxy S8. The addition of Viv’s digital assistant is certainly a step in the right direction. How much better it will be as compared to the incumbents, only time will tell. But from what has been seen with the Viv demo, things definitely look promising.

The company argues that most people use Google search on mobile anyway and that such users will obviously prefer results that link to mobile sites. Google’s current algorithm indexes the desktop version of a website and ranks that sites pages for content in desktop mode. Google says that today, this is the wrong approach to take. Mobile sites can sometimes offer less information than their desktop counterparts, which is bad for a mobile-first world. Keeping this in mind, Google is now conducting experiments with its search algorithm to determine the best way to rank websites in the future. “Although our search index will continue to be a single index of websites and apps, our algorithms will eventually primarily use the mobile version of a site’s content to rank pages from that site, to understand structured data, and to show snippets from those pages in our results.” Currently, Google’s live indexing algorithm is still looking at Desktop pages first, so you have some breathing space to transition your site to mobile (if you haven’t already). The company says that if you have a responsive, dynamic website, you shouldn’t be worried. If you don’t have that and instead use different structures for desktop and mobile, Google has some suggestions for you here. Google adds that if you’re building a new site, it will be better to have a functional desktop site than an incomplete mobile site.

But the $US129 Google Home, which the company sent for me to review last week, stops short of that vision right now. Don't get me wrong: when Google Home works, it is nothing short of delightful. It just doesn't always work.

Overall, I had no problems with set-up and very few problems getting Google to understand me. Even having lived with the Amazon Echo for months — and therefore being pretty used to controlling things with my voice — there were still some great things that Google Home offered that stood out. The best of these was integration with the Chromecast, Google's streaming device. Being able to search for YouTube videos and have them play on my television without having to lift a finger was great — especially while doing chores that required both my hands. (Ironing can be the worst, right?) It's a little convenience, but one that is very welcome. Being able to pause and resume my videos with Google Home felt a little bit like magic, especially since the user interface on my phone for Chromecast doesn't always obey my commands. Google Home, a smart speaker that can control your home and manage other connected environments, is not officially sold in Australia yet.  Another neat feature was being able to listen to podcasts on-command, even if I hadn't subscribed to them. It was a nice way to try something new without having to pull out my phone, do some searching and hook it up to the speaker. Yet the wins for Google Home, in some ways, just set high expectations for other commands that it didn't meet. Advertisement Some were small. One unexpected downside: saying "OK Google" into my living room also activated the voice assistant on my Android phone, leading to an occasional, unintentional chorus. Also, when I had the music on a little too loud, as with Amazon's Alexa, Google Home couldn't quite hear me — but that could easily be taken as a compliment to Google's speakers rather than an insult to its microphones. Other issues were much bigger. Empowered by my first brush with success with podcasts, for example, I asked for a specific episode of a podcast I had missed: no dice. When dealing with the Chromecast, I got bold and asked it to work with third-party apps that also work with Google's streaming stick — a feature that hasn't been added yet. Feeling out the edges of Google Home's current capabilities was frustrating. While I have no doubt that Google will add more services constantly — it will have to if it wants to keep up its arms race with Echo's capabilities — it will be a long training process for the both of us. And there were simply some services that I use that Google Home doesn't work with, such as iTunes. In fact, I couldn't hook up my iPhone's music to Google Home at all. Amazon's Echo can work as a Bluetooth speaker, meaning that even if Apple and Amazon never get along, my iPhone and my Echo still can. With the Google Home, I'm somewhat out of luck. That put something into sharper focus: if you want the most out of Google Home, you have to fall in line with the Google universe. That doesn't solely mean Google products, but it does mean only products with which Google has a good relationship. And that subtle steer to your purchasing decisions isn't one that should be ignored, regardless of your voice assistant of choice. Consumers won't have to choose their tech giant of choice quite yet, but in the future, you may buy your appliances and light bulbs based on which voice assistant you use. That day, though, is not today. And the truth is that it won't be tomorrow either — for Google Home or Echo. These are both capable products right now, and people who want to play with these products — at least those in countries where they're freely available, which doesn't include Australia just yet — should buy one if they want it. In terms of recommendations, I'd say that Google Home is best for people who've already got a Chromecast and use Google services; those who don't may want to look at the Echo. But ultimately, the Google Home — and any voice-controlled device — is an investment in future technology. In fact, Google Home does a great job of pointing that out itself. Ask it for something it can't do, and it will tell you that it only can't do it "yet," leaving open the tantalising possibility that someday it will do everything that I ask of it. Just not today.

The learning curve was steep because the work was so different, and the experience was often humbling, but, if I had to, I’d make the same choice again today. The advertising agency as an institution is about 60 years old, but it hasn’t changed much since the 1960s. If you take alcohol and cigarettes out of Mad Men, what you end up with is essentially a modern creative agency. Technology companies, on the other hand, are only 20 years old, so it makes sense they’re fresher, and that many advertising creatives have crossed over into tech. As a creative in advertising agency, you have to prove yourself every day. The competition with your peers can be overwhelming, budget cuts are always looming, and there’s a need to build and maintain relationships with clients you have nothing in common with, and probably don’t like to begin with. The evolution of technology is exponential, but our ability to learn is incremental, and I felt the gap widening at the big-network agencies I worked for. Nimble, adaptable, and always quick on the draw Before I joined Google, I had a corner office at Young & Rubicam. I had a driver and a personal assistant. But at Google, there’s a flat structure. For the first time in years, I was working in an open-plan office, and I had to book my own flights and do all my own admin. Suddenly, I was part of a refreshing new world, alive with experimentation and full of enthusiastic young people with amazing ideas. I went from being a tyrant with veto powers to being just one voice among many, and needing to be nimble, adaptable, and always quick on the draw. Because of the flat structure, the most passionate voice is usually the one that resonates the loudest, and that shines through in the end product. Google’s creative mantras are: the product is the idea; users above all; make people smile, cry or think; and demos and documentaries, not adverts. As an advertiser, I was familiar with the first three, but I was also an ad-making machine, and found it very difficult to leave fantasy at the door in favour of demos and documentaries. I felt confined at first, but I soon realised the value of the mantra – what touches people most profoundly are slices of real life. Storytelling vs storydoing The crux of the issue lies in storytelling vs storydoing. Writing scripts, however fun they might be, in isolation no longer works – you need to have an effect on people’s lives, and the way to have the greatest effect is to consider the context of their lives. In the 1980s, McDonald’s branches were the same the world over, but now each country has a locally shaped menu. It’s a good model for communicating international brands on a local level, showing the need to capture the distinctive culture of place and gain local insight. Because of the incredible targeting power we have today through data, niche is the new mainstream, allowing us to talk directly to people in a tone and language that resonates with them. But despite the power of niche advertising, there are also pitfalls to consider, which film studio Universal recently discovered when it released two trailers for the movie Straight Outta Compton. The first, aimed at white audiences, was slicker, with a higher production value, and erred away from the film’s gritty subject matter. The trailer aimed at black audiences was far more reflective of the film’s charged and often uncomfortable content. Both audiences, however, saw the move for what it was – a ploy to sell more tickets. The studio would have done well to think about Google’s mantras before embarking on the campaign. It’s not my intention to be an evangelist for technology, nor to rubbish an industry to which I devoted 20 years of my life. But I do hope to plant doubts about the career choices so many people take for granted, as well as their ways of communicating. It’s never too late to change – I’m living proof.

That’s whether it gets a new owner or not. On Thursday, Twitter announced one immediate change: It’s shutting down its once-pioneering video-sharing app Vine, which has been eclipsed by the likes of Snapchat and Instagram. What else might be in the works? For now, think tons of small tweaks rather than a 180-degree turn. In a conference call discussing the San Francisco-company’s quarterly earnings, an analyst asked CEO Jack Dorsey if there were any plans for big, revolutionary product changes. “We’ve been making hundreds of small changes as quickly as we can,” Dorsey’s responded, adding that users are showing that the “changes are working.” For now, it’s looking like Twitter will stay an independent company, despite months of rumors to the contrary. But a new owner could still swoop in, and depending on who it is, could clean up Twitter and curb some of the nastiness that’s become synonymous with it. Or perhaps a new owner would just show more ads. Or let it languish while it mines the best of what Twitter now has into its existing products and services. All of this is speculation, of course, and there might not even be a new owner. Twitter’s stock has plunged after rumored bidders are, well, rumored to be no longer interested. On Thursday, the company announced that it would cut 9 percent of its workforce globally as its revenue growth slowed. While its adjusted earnings beat Wall Street expectations, it reported a loss of almost $103 million before one-time charges and costs are removed. A new parent — whether that’s Google (huh?), Salesforce (who?) or Disney (hmm…) — could inject fresh life into a 10-year-old company that’s never turned a profit and remains confounding to many people. Of course, none of these potential suitors have acknowledged interest in Twitter, let alone their plans for it. Even if Twitter stays independent, drastic changes to its service might just be what Twitter needs to be competitive with Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat. How might it change? Twitter becomes more like its new owner, if there is one Facebook’s absorption of Instagram and WhatsApp in recent years could offer clues. Both services have kept separate identities, to an extent, and have experienced user growth. But slowly, they are acquiring Facebook-like features. For example, Instagram no longer presents feeds chronologically; they are now sorted much like Facebook’s news feed, using some secret formula known only to Facebook. Though the change has turned off some early Instagram users, its user base has soared, to 500 million as of June. That’s nearly 200 million more than Twitter, even though Instagram is three years younger. As Instagram gets more users and a mainstream appeal, its content has diluted somewhat. But many of the street photographers, graffiti artists and tween mini-celebrities who made Instagram what it is are still there — maybe just harder to find. Twitter stays the same but with more ads Twitter has never turned a profit, and whoever buys it will need to fix this. That means boosting the user base, so advertisers would follow. That also could mean better targeting, so that ad rates go up. Google, anyone? The search giant is the leader in online ads. Imagine what its might and muscle could do to Twitter’s ad business. YouTube hardly had any ads when Google bought it; now, ads are so prevalent that YouTube is able to charge $10 a month for an ad-free version called Red. Instagram has also inserted ads into users’ feeds of perfectly composed snapshots featuring everything from cappuccino foam to seafoam. It started out slowly with a carefully curated ad here and there, but today you’re not likely to avoid ads when opening the app. It becomes a tool for brands, not revolution Jonathan Cowperthwait, a Twitter user since 2008, said he’d be worried if Google bought Twitter because the online search giant “is the worst” at social services that aim to foster online interactions, beyond email. Its Google Plus service never took off; Orkut and Dodgeball closed. Cowperthwait said that rather than let Twitter live independently, Google might “try to shoehorn it back into their own social product.” Salesforce, a company that provides internet services to businesses, has also been mentioned as a contender, leading to a lot of head-scratching among users. Would Twitter become a business product, used for customer service and marketing instead of revolutions, neo-Nazi memes and political outbursts? “Salesforce is a very technology-driven company,” eMarketer analyst Debra Aho Williamson said. “It seems they would want [Twitter] mostly for the data that Twitter has.” The little bird falls out of the nest Remember MySpace? It was — the — social network before Facebook came along. News Corp., the stodgy media conglomerate, bought it for $580 million in 2005. But users started falling off as MySpace failed to keep up with Facebook’s speedy innovations. After layoffs and failed relaunches, News Corp. sold the fallen giant for $35 million in 2011, and that was just about the end of it. It’s not unthinkable that Twitter could suffer the same fate under a big media company. Silence! Walt Disney’s reputation as a squeaky-clean, family-friendly company is perhaps the clearest antithesis to Twitter’s soul, as many users see it — even though Disney is much bigger than Mickey Mouse and owns ABC, Marvel and the “Star Wars” franchise, among other properties. “My chief fear is that Disney will wield Twitter as one large PR machine to prop up their image and squash dissent,” said Timothy Hayes, an Ohio State University student who says he fell in love with Twitter in high school. “The Mouse is not above silencing [its] opponents.” Some users, on the other hand, might welcome some thorough housecleaning that goes beyond the steps Twitter is currently taking to curb abuse and nasty behavior on its service. One Twitter user, New York attorney Danny Mann, says that while Google has improved YouTube “in ways that were unimaginable at the time,” he finds many of his fellow YouTube users difficult to deal with. In this sense, it’s possible that even with Google’s weight behind it, the abusive and nasty nature of many Twitter comments would remain as is.

Google, in one of the most experimental yet relevant changes in recent times, will now test a new ‘mobile-first’ version while indexing search results. This move essentially means Google will primarily rank websites based on their mobile friendly pages. This is a big change since earlier desktop computers were the heart and soul of Google when it comes to search results. However, Google will run the tests for a while to refine it and ensure desktop users are not left behind. This change will not affect websites which are made to work and fit into a mobile mode, or only on the desktop. The issue as of now is only for websites which have different contents for both the mediums. This move by Google to put the impetus on the core product optimisation is definitely to stay with the times, as the mobile searches now far exceed searches on PCs. Google product manager Doantam Phan wrote in the Google’s official webmaster blog,”Although our search index will continue to be a single index of websites and apps, our algorithms will eventually primarily use the mobile version of a site’s content to rank pages from that site, to understand structured data, and to show snippets from those pages in our results.” While, Google is still working on the features and there are a lot of implications. While overall this may be a welcome change for users as the search results will get better, some websites can lose out on this change. In order to make everyone ready for this change, Google has a few recommendations which include structured markup, data testing tools, Googlebot and canonical links among others. These recommendations are available on Google’s ‘Webmaster Central Blog’. Please Wait while comments are loading...

Here’s what that makes Google Pixel a best Android smarpthone By Michael Turner - Nov 7, 2016 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter The recently launched Google Pixel smartphone is creating so much hype in the smartphone market, the smartphone is claimed by the company to boast best smartphone camera ever. Also, the reviewers are comparing its camera pairs with the professional DSLR camera. In addition, some people using the handset are fans of its performance. Now the question here arises if someone is planning to buy the smartphone what should be considered, its performance or its camera? So clearing out readers that it is not a myth anymore that the smartphone comes with the best camera ever. With f/2.0 aperture and 1.55um pixels drawing in maximum light, the point and click experience seems promising. With a 12.3 megapixel rear and 8-megapixel front camera, all you budding photographers can click your best. Also, DXOMark gives the rear camera 89 points, the highest points ever for any smartphone. The company says in a quote, “It’s easy to capture that perfect shot. Take crisp photos, even in low light. And catch action shots as the happen with Smartburst. Once you’ve captured the moment, Google Photos Keeps all your photos backed up and organised, so that you can find and share them fast.” The company really has been putting its efforts to offer best photography experience to its users. And for the same, Google has recently launched an update, after acknowledging the lens flare issues in its recently launched Pixel phones, Google is whispered to bring a software update for bug fixing in the mid-November. After receiving so many complaints about the malfunction in the camera app, Google is gearing up to fix the issues with the minor update, which is expected to dispatch by the end of November. The lens flare issues are found in most of the Pixel devices, causing the drop in image quality when piercing directly at an intense light source. Google, soon after launching the Pixel smartphones on October 13, started receiving complaints from a number of users about the ‘Arc Flare’ aka ‘Halo effect’ on images clicking from the Pixel phones. Isaac, the admin of Google Pixel device in a blog said, “Users are going to have a refreshed software update in the next couple of weeks which is completely intended to will fix the camera lens issues of Pixel smartphones. Currently, the technical team of Google is working on some algorithms which will identify the Halo or ARC flare effects in the camera portion of the Pixel Phones. However, he mentioned that the users need to have HDR+ to grab the benefits of this new software update.” Now talking about the performance, the Google Pixel is the first handset to boast the newest cutting edge chooser. The new silicon tout is a 10% speed increase in booting and loading of apps, in comparison with the Snapdragon 820. While the chipset offers incremental improvements in efficiency, the GPU/CPU picks up its pace. Unlike some who buy just for the sake of brand, the rest of us have a wide range of features to be checked in for a smartphone especially, when paying a fortune for it. The Google Pixel just lessened your work by covering most of the features like metal-glass build, top-notch processing power and graphics, 4GB RAM and the newest Android version along with the AL Google Assistant, the ultimate Daydream VR support, the best camera ever and numerous other pros.

The phone also offers decent battery backup and quick charging, iIn a world where the whole population is chained to their phones and the latter to their chargers. The Pixel provides fast charging support for a quick top-up which needless to say, is a blessing not in disguise. The 5 inch Google Pixel uses AMOLED display with a 2770 mah battery capacity. The smartphone is available in Very Silver, Quite Black and Really Blue colour. Interesting, isn’t it? Though HTC designed the phone, Google owns every single piece of the phone from inside out, extending all the way to the flat dark grey G, on the lower of the rear. Google said that initially it was famed for a software company and advancement in technology are driven at the intersection of software and hardware. So, Google successfully showcased its software capabilities in hardware that is tailored specifically for all its users. Debates trending on Twitter like “Google shouldn’t try to be Apple” is a fallacy. Rather than suppressing its capabilities, Google played to its strengths. What do you want in a phone, solely depends on you and it influences your expectations and demands. The features available in Pixel, if are what you have been searching for, your prayers just got answered. Yes, the Google Pixel is a lot of money, but it is the real deal. It is a flagship product which commands flagship price. Fair enough. Apple and Samsung just got a run for their money. With the Pixel, Google keeps things nice and easy.

Prior to the Pixel, Google offered a series of Nexus-branded smartphones that it developed with smartphone makers and sold online, at prices that essentially covered its costs. But while the Nexus phones supported the company’s primary business of online advertising by getting more people to use Google services, the Pixel seems to be geared toward monetizing Google’s AI initiatives, specifically its efforts to build a virtual assistant that will act as a user’s “own personal Google” and provide a consistent experience across an entire line of Google-designed gadgets. Google’s new Pixel phone represents an evolution of the company’s business model. The move prepares Google for a world of conversational interfaces in which consumers will acquire information by speaking to virtual assistants embedded in a range of electronic devices. As such, the Pixel is a test of Google’s technological bets on these interfaces and the AI that powers them, as well as the company’s ability to deeply integrate its services into hardware, create a family of gadgets that will form a complementary ecosystem, and make money off something other than online ads. Its outcome will show whether Google can evolve and continue its domination in search. In the hypercompetitive smartphone market, the only way to reap significant profits is to create a premium phone and sell it at a premium price. So Google selected top-of-the-line parts for the Pixel and is selling the device for $649, the same starting price as Apple’s iPhone 7 and Samsung’s Galaxy S7. (A 5.5-inch version of the Pixel, called the Pixel XL, costs $769, which is the same as the iPhone 7 Plus.) Third-party analyses indicate that Google is making a generous margin on the phone. IHS Markit, a London-based market research firm, estimates that the Pixel XL’s material and manufacturing cost is $285.75, based on an examination of its internal components. Chipworks, a division of the technical analysis firm TechInsights, gives an estimate of around $220, but it didn’t include as many components or manufacturing costs in its evaluation as IHS did, according to analyst Dick James. Analysts have estimated the phone's manufacturing cost by opening it up and identifying its internal components. These figures are speculative and don’t reflect major expenses such as R&D, patent licensing, and marketing. But they are the most accurate data available in the absence of official information from Google. And they suggest that the Pixel has a gross profit margin only slightly smaller than that of the iPhone 7, which is the world’s most profitable smartphone (along with the iPhone 7 Plus). Another way to gauge how much Google is making off the Pixel is to compare the phone—and its retail price—to a phone with similar hardware. James, the Chipworks analyst, has identified at least twelve common components between the Pixel XL and the Mi 5s from the Chinese startup Xiaomi, ranging from their Qualcomm processor to their primary camera (a 12 megapixel model from Sony). Yet the international version of the Mi 5s costs $250 less than the Pixel XL. The Pixel's profit margin is a big jump up from what Google made on its Nexus phones and will help the company pursue high-end hardware seriously, which is the only sustainable business model in this tough market, says IHS Markit analyst Wayne Lam. Google is differentiating the Pixel with its virtual helper and virtual reality software, which require significant investments in AI and machine learning. Indeed, burgeoning consumer interest in virtual assistants and VR is one reason why Google is revamping its smartphone strategy. The maturation of the smartphone industry is another. Microsoft and BlackBerry’s slumping smartphone businesses have pitted Google and Apple against each other for market dominance. As a result, Google believes it needs a single Android phone that can truly take on the iPhone, and matching the Pixel’s price with the iPhone’s is the company’s way of telling consumers the devices are comparable. The other relevant change in the smartphone market is that Samsung is the only company that currently manages to make money selling premium Android phones (in spite of its Galaxy Note 7 debacle). Several years ago, Google would have hesitated to release a pricy smartphone under its own brand for fear of alienating its many Android partners. But Samsung’s control of the high-end Android phone market has concerned Google for some time and it likely hopes that the Pixel will diminish this dominance. So far, the Pixel is selling more briskly than Google expected. It’s too early to gauge whether it will be a success, but it does show how Google intends to compete in an AI-first world.   Weren't able to make it to EmTech? We've got you covered.

After the desktop computer, the internet and the smartphone, the time is here for the next big thing. According to Sundar Pichai and Google, that revolution for the next ten years is artificial intelligence. Apple and its CEO Tim Cook, however, might be betting on augmented reality. In a recent interview, Apple CEO Tim Cook had said that AR would be a big thing for years to come. That is a pretty forward looking statement from a secretive company that hesitates to talk about the future. Apple does not have any device in the category of head mounted displays at this time. Facebook has Oculus, Microsoft has HoloLens, and the Google Glass is still available to research and industrial partners. It is unclear if the AR experience will come to a standalone product, or a head mounted display where the iPhone is inserted. Faceshift allows for realtime expression tracking and mapping There are a string of AR related acquisitions by Apple. In January this year, Apple acquired Emotient, a company that makes AR software to analyse the moods and emotions of faces in real time. In November 2015, Apple acquired Faceshift, a real time motion capture company whose technology was used in Star Wars. In May last year, Apple had acquired Metaio, a company that makes software for AR overlays for industrial applications. The technology blends computer generated imagery into real world video and the software is used in retail, industrial and automative markets. Apple is hiring the best in AR talent as well. In January this year, Apple hired Virginia Tech professor Doug Bowman. Bowman has written a book on 3D user interfaces, and has contributed to the Microsoft research of HoloLens. Bowman is one of the leading experts in augmented reality. In August 2015, Apple hired Nick Thompson, the leading audio engineer for the Microsoft HoloLens team. In September this year, Apple hired  Zeyu Li, an engineer who worked for Augmented reality startup MagicLeap and in June, Apple poached Yury Petrov from Oculus. Taj Reid, Senior Designer at Microsoft wears a HoloLens VR headset at Microsoft’s Windows 10 “Creators Update” live event in New York Apple owns patents for head mounted displays with augmented reality capabilities. One of these devices can be used with an iPhone. Developers point out that the SceneKit SDK since iOS 9 has a listing for “HeadMountedDisplayRenderingTechnique”. Apple apparently has a secret research unit consisting of employees from acquisitions and engineers poached from other augmented reality companies. The team is working on a next generation head mounted augmented reality device to take on Oculus or HoloLens by Microsoft. Analysts tracking the company have said that Apple is about to take big steps towards boosting their AR capabilities. FBR & Co analyst Daniel Ives said that Apple would take aggressive measure to grow organically as well as through acquisitions over 2016, and that AR is the next generation of consumer technology that could fit well with the iPhone. Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster in a note to investors said that Apple is going to “pivot on iOS in a bid for the mixed reality space”, and may allow third party partners to make headsets to be used with the iPhone. Eventually, the iPhone may be phased out entirely in favour of a head mounted mixed reality device. A surgeon using AR technology to help with a live liver surgery on an Apple iPad in Germany. Apple seems to be gearing up for the AR space, the clearest sign so far has been an interview with Buzzfeed in Japan. Tim Cook said that AR could not replace human contact and Apple was looking for technology to do that. Cook stressed that while VR may be good for education and gaming, AR is better suited for a wider range of applications. Apple is apparently also in talk with companies that make content for immersive experiences.

The last device released, the Sharp 507SH, landed in Japan but with Android Marshmallow out of the box. Since then Nougat has been released and now General Mobile has announced the GM 5, the first Android One device to launch with the latest version of Google’s mobile OS… Like other Android One devices, the GM 5 runs stock Android with updates direct from Google. As for specs, this device brings a 5-inch 720p display with Gorilla Glass 4, quad-core Snapdragon 410 processor, 2GB of RAM, 16GB of internal storage with a microSD card slot, a 13MP rear camera, and a 5MP front-facing shooter. The phone weighs in at 160g — by comparison, the 5-inch Pixel weighs 143g — and packs a 2,500 mAh battery. The GM 5 will be available in Space Grey, Gold, and Black. The GM 5 is designed for international markets including Azerbaijan, Albania, Afghanistan, Belgium, Bosnia, Croatia, Cyprus, Georgia, Ghana, Greece, Iraq, Kenya, Luxembourg, Moldova, Netherlands, Pakistan, Serbia, Tunisia, Turkey, and Uzbekistan. Pricing has not been announced yet, but we should hear more soon since the phone goes on sale this month. Also worth noting is that this is not directly related to the GM 5 Plus which was released earlier this year. Despite that phone also being in the Android One program, it isn’t the same as it brings higher-end specifications and a price tag which is presumably much higher.

Comments Computerworld | Nov 6, 2016 7:16 PM PT RELATED TOPICS Smartphones Android Personal Technology Samsung Comments All the cool tech companies are doing it. Introducing A.I.-powered digital assistants, that is. Google has the Google Assistant, Apple has Siri, Microsoft has Cortana. And Samsung doesn't want to be left out. That is why the tech giant is going to be debuting it's next phone, the Samsung Galaxy S8, with a digital assistant all its own. In IT Blogwatch, we ask Siri to introduce us. So what's happening? Jungah Lee has the background: Samsung...plans to equip its next Galaxy S smartphones with a Siri-like digital assistant, seeking to make a comeback after the global debacle that precipitated the death of its flawed Note 7 lineup. ... Samsung, which last month acquired...artificial-intelligence software company Viv Labs Inc., said the Galaxy S8 slated for next year will come with A.I.-enabled features “significantly differentiated” from those of Apple’s Siri or Google. How will the technology work with Samsung's upcoming phones? Se Young Lee and Nataly Pak have the details: Samsung plans to integrate the...A.I. platform...into the Galaxy smartphones and expand voice-assistant services to home appliances and wearable technology devices...Samsung did not comment on what types of services would be offered through the A.I. assistant...It said the A.I. assistant would allow customers to use third-party service seamlessly. Aside from the recent acquisition of Viv Labs, is there any reason why Samsung is introducing a digital assistant now? Alexandra Burlacu can think of a reason: Samsung has so far stayed out of the smart assistant race...That won't be the case for long...Considering the...blow it took from two Galaxy Note 7 recalls, Samsung desperately needs its Galaxy S8 to be a...hit. The A.I. digital assistant could raise...interest, offer...advanced functionality and help Samsung rebuild consumer confidence after the massive Note 7 flop. ... Samsung's...digital assistant is apparently dubbed Bixby and the company already applied for a trademark. And just in case you have been living under a rock for the last few years, what is the big deal with A.I.? Steven Musil fills us in: Artificial intelligence...is widely expected to represent the next frontier of computing...A.I.-powered voice assistants have suddenly become all the rage, offering a hands-free and more natural way to ask questions, find information and manage busy lives. Do we know anything else about the Galaxy S8? Specs? Release date? Sean Riley tells us what he knows: Samsung has stuck to a...consistent schedule with the Galaxy S line over the years, introducing new phones on or around each year’s Mobile World Congress...The 2017 Mobile World Congress starts Feb. 27. ... Galaxy S8...reports...indicate that Samsung is ready to step up the resolution...to 4K UHD...Samsung Display engineer Park Won-sang...indicated...Samsung would be rolling out a display...that covers 90 percent of the body...Achieving this ratio would mean dropping the physical home button...With Huawei, LG and Apple now offering rear cameras with two lenses, look for Samsung to follow suit with the S8. So, any first reactions to the news? Chris Black has one: The S8 will boast a brand new-state of the art Artificial Intelligence based Digital Assistant...If you ask me, that sounds like Apple’s Siri on steroids...Samsung needs a...fire-proof flagship smartphone to clear up its reputation...Let’s hope that Bixby and the Galaxy S8 will make Samsung Great Again!

The company was not immediately available to comment.  Snap Inc, which operates the popular messaging app Snapchat, has hired Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group Inc as lead underwriters for an initial public offering.  The banks were notified last month that they had been awarded one of most coveted and potentially lucrative IPO mandates in recent years, as the Venice, California-based company vies for a US$25bil (RM105.25bil) valuation in the stock market.  Snapchat, which lets users send smartphone photos which automatically disappear after a few seconds, has proven popular among teenage users.  The company had reportedly rejected an acquisition offer from Facebook Inc that would have valued the company at US$3bil (RM12.63bil) or more in 2013. — Reuters You May Be Interested Legislature gives final approval to autonomous vehicle bills After Airbnb and Uber, wardrobe rental services could be the next travel trend For some, the Zune is not gone and definitely not forgotten Where are you on the journey to financial freedom?

Their design and operation has been refined over more than 100 years by dozens of companies building basically the same four-wheeled machines, all hell-bent on outdoing one another. No other complex consumer product is so refined. Take, for example, the steering wheel. It’s a brilliant invention, a wonderfully intuitive way for humans to control the complex series of hydraulic, electric and mechanical linkages that move the front wheels and turn a car. The volume knob too, its location was agreed-upon by a kind of slow, evolutionary process Darwin would have recognized. You know where it is, and can use it without taking your eyes off the road. The turn signals too, they’re right there, just an outstretched finger away. The car, however, is about to undergo an overhaul. Everything is on the table. There are three simultaneous new technologies reshaping the automobile: self-driving, electric powertrains and car-sharing services. Combined, it’s nothing less than a revolution. “There has been a long, slow evolution and perfection of the craft of car design over the years,” says Laura Robin, director of BMW’s Designworks Los Angeles Studio. “What we’re looking at now is a 90-degree reframe.” Karim Habib, BMW’s head of design, stands next to the Vision Next 100. BMW Car designers aren’t quite starting from a blank-sheet – there are still four wheels – but everything else is up for reinvention. At the moment, everyone from tech-giants to startups to major auto makers are throwing everything at the wall to see what sticks. Google wants to get rid of the steering wheel. Its first prototype self-driving vehicle eliminated all human controls, including pedals. The interior of the Google car as seen in a screen capture from a Google video Google “It was clearly not done by an automotive designer,” says Paul Snyder, chair of the Transportation Design department, College of Creative Studies, Detroit. “It looked like somebody took an Apple magic mouse and put wheels on it. It would make a really good tape dispenser or something like that.” Most established auto makers are leaning toward keeping the steering wheel and pedals, at least in some form for now so humans can drive in difficult situations. The inteior of the Mercedes-Benz F 015 Petrina Gentile/for The Globe and Mail On its F 015 concept, Mercedes-Benz imagined a retractable steering wheel and swivelling seats. There are screens everywhere, even around the lower half of the doors. Another Mercedes concept, the Vision Van, has roof-launched drones and a joystick instead of a steering wheel. A rendering of the interior for a Mercedes-Benz Vision Tokyo Daimler BMW’s Vision Next 100 concept has retractable controls that disappear into the dash so you can kick back and let the car handle the traffic. The BMW Vision Next 100 displayed at an event in Germany. Tom Maloney/The Globe and Mail Where the interiors are radical, the exteriors are plain in terms of the overall silhouette. “We’ve had a history of being exquisite sculptors, and now we’re asking designers to start with a wider lens, to start with a notion of interaction experiences,” Robin says. In the past, when designing a new car, they’d start with geometry: What are the proportions, what kind of car is it? That would define the exterior and the interior would follow. “Within certain segments, vehicles do look a lot alike,” Snyder says. “Everybody is working to the same very rigid crash-protection and pedestrian-safety requirements.” Robin imagines cars being designed not just from the inside out, but from the experience out. “The questions are really inverted,” she says. What will you want to do inside the car? How will you interact with the car if you’re not driving it? What is the experience of ordering this sharable-car to your door like? How seamlessly does it know your preferences? Mercedes-Benz’s concept car Vision Tokyo is unveiled at the media preview for the Tokyo Motor Show in Tokyo Wednesday, Oct. 28, 2015. Shuji Kajiyama/AP Snyder says there are more radical designs to come. “Beyond the Google car, most of the concepts have been very automotive. I don’t think the architecture has been exploited.” For example? “If you look at an electric drivetrain, you have the flexibility to move the cabin both back and forward,” he says. Gasoline motors are bulkier than their electric counterparts. “Imagine someone facing rearward in the front seats. Now what will that do to a silhouette? You’re going to have a box or bus-like silhouette. Might be very good for interior spaciousness. A lot of people might be better served in a kind of living room or office on wheels.” The Mini Vision Next 100 electric concept automobile, produced by Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW), sits on display during its unveiling in London, U.K., on Thursday, June 16, 2016. This year, the namesake marque will probably lose its sales leadership in luxury cars to Mercedes-Benz for the first time since 2005. Chris Ratcliffe/Bloomberg That bus-like shape is something designers usually work hard to avoid. In China, with a group of design students, Snyder put the problem to them: “There must be ways of making that exciting and attractive.” The students drew from contemporary culture way outside the automotive realm. “If you draw on your influence from action-hero helmets or storm trooper helmets, EVA space-shuttles, you can do some really cool-looking things,” he said. “There’s an enormous amount to be explored with OLED (organic light-emitting diode) graphics, both projected inward on glass surfaces and outward.” He’s a big fan of the Audi concept car from the movie I, Robot, the one Will Smith used to evade an army of killer robots. “It was beyond awesome. Up there with the Lamborghini Countach in my mind.” But what of sports cars such as the beautifully designed Lambroghini Countach, cars for people who still want to drive? Do they have a future? Both Robin and Snyder say yes. “People are going to want to engage with cars emotionally still and not only see them as these tools to get you from A to B,” Robin says. “There’s still going to be this need to have the wind whistling through your hair as you get out on the weekend.” This is the fourth article in a seven-part multimedia series on self-driving cars that examines the past, the current technology and what the future may hold.
