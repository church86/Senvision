Bring it on. How Pittsburgh became Uber’s testing ground No driver? Bring it on. How Pittsburgh became Uber’s testing ground Uber cars prepare to roll through Pittsburgh to map out the roads and topography before the introduction of the company’s driverless vehicles. By Cecilia Kang, New York Times News Service September 11, 2016 PITTSBURGH — Any day now, Uber will introduce a fleet of self-driving cars in Pittsburgh, making this former steel town the world’s first city to let passengers hail autonomous vehicles. So with the world watching, what has the city of 306,000 done to prepare for Uber’s unprecedented test? The answer is not much. There have been no public service announcements or demonstrations of the technology. Except for the mayor and one police official, no other top city leader has seen a self-driving Uber vehicle operate up close. Fire and emergency services don’t know where the Uber cars will travel. Advertisement It is precisely this hands-off approach that has made Pittsburgh ideal grounds for one of Silicon Valley’s boldest experiments — and it has ignited criticism that the city is giving away its keys to Uber, which is testing a nascent technology and has a reputation for running roughshod over regulators and municipalities. “It’s not our role to throw up regulations or limit companies like Uber,” said Bill Peduto, Pittsburgh’s mayor, who said that Uber planned to use about 100 modified Volvo sport utility vehicles for the passenger trials. The vehicles will also have a human monitor behind the wheel. “You can either put up red tape or roll out the red carpet. If you want to be a 21st-century laboratory for technology, you put out the carpet.” The mayor’s mantra highlights what it takes these days as cities seek to shed their Rust Belt pasts and transform themselves into technology hubs — essentially, give the tech companies lots of free rein. The approach, described as greenlight governing, is one that Pittsburgh and the state of Pennsylvania have nurtured over the last few years. When Uber wanted to expand its research around autonomous vehicles, Pittsburgh helped the company lease a large plot near the city’s riverfront for a testing track. When state regulators tried to ban ride-hailing services in 2014, Pittsburgh’s mayor and the state’s governor helped bat those hurdles down. Otherwise, Pittsburgh’s politicians stay out of the way. Mayor Bill Peduto has worked with Uber to allow access to test its vehicles on Pittsburgh streets. “You can either put up red tape or roll out the red carpet,” he said. Advertisement The approach has many benefits, allowing Pittsburgh and Pennsylvania to position themselves at the forefront of a driverless-vehicle movement that has swept up tech companies including automakers, Google and Baidu of China. It has brought tech entrepreneurs to Pittsburgh and attracted hundreds of scientists and engineers to new research centers opened in the city in the last decade by Apple, Google, Intel and Uber. But it also has invited criticism from those who say Pittsburgh is giving too much power to tech companies, all for a sheen of innovation. Some residents are on edge about Uber’s self-driving vehicles and complain that they have been thrust into an experiment with potential safety risks. “I feel like we were pushed into being part of this by the city,” said Montana Michniak, a recent college graduate who works at a cafe in the city’s South Side neighborhood. How Pittsburgh handles the unveiling of Uber’s self-driving fleet is being closely watched by other tech and auto companies that are doing their own driverless experiments in places like California and Michigan (although Apple is said to have laid off dozens of employees in its self-driving car project and to be rethinking its strategy). Depressed cities around the nation are watching to see if the Pittsburgh story can be a blueprint for their own transitions into tech hubs. “This is the first mayor in Pittsburgh to really get it, and that’s a big reason why the city has become the best case of Rust Belt revival,” said Richard Florida, a professor of urban studies at the University of Toronto, who previously taught at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. He said he was “frankly surprised at how long a leash” Uber got. Advertisement Peduto said Uber did not have too much power in Pittsburgh and that the city would be safe because there would be a human monitor in the Uber test cars. The mayor also has his eye on a bigger safety goal. “There is no technology that is fail-proof, and there is no tech that can guarantee there won’t be accidents, but right now there are 3,287 people who die in automobile-related accidents around the world each day, and there has to be a better way,” he said. When Uber wanted to expand its research on autonomous vehicles, Pittsburgh helped the company lease a large plot near the city’s riverfront for a testing track. In a statement, Uber said of Pittsburgh, “Our work would not be possible without the support we’ve received from city leaders.” Uber came to Pittsburgh in early 2015, drawn by the engineering talent at Carnegie Mellon. The university started a robotics department 30 years ago, when driverless cars seemed like a fantasy, but robotics has since proved crucial for the systems that let vehicles navigate streets on their own. By this decade, the university’s expertise in computer science had attracted not only Uber but also General Motors, Google and Intel, some of which embedded at Carnegie Mellon. Google and Uber later opened research centers, hiring dozens of Carnegie Mellon professors and graduate students. Today, Uber has 500 employees at a center in Pittsburgh’s industrial Strip District working on autonomous vehicles, according to Peduto. Uber will have 1,000 employees at the site, known as the Advanced Technology Center, within a few years and plans to increase investments to $1 billion from hundreds of millions of dollars in a decade, he said. For driverless car tests, Pennsylvania also held a legal advantage. Specifically, the state’s transportation rules did not explicitly ban driverless cars, as long as someone was behind the wheel to take over if needed. Officials from Pennsylvania’s transportation agency said they interpreted that silence on driverless technology as a green light. Some state officials said they also believed that driverless cars could be safer than those steered by drivers, helping avoid driver-related deaths. “We’d be committing governmental malpractice if we didn’t pursue this technology,” said Roger Cohen, the policy director of the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation. Driverless cars with Uber’s logo have cruised around town for months, in part to get the public used to seeing them. In Pittsburgh, Peduto fostered a close relationship with Uber. In Peduto’s first meeting in early 2015 with Uber’s chief executive, Travis Kalanick, Kalanick said he had noticed efforts by Peduto and other officials to fight the state public utilities commission’s proposed ban on ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft in 2014. Kalanick also laid out a plan for Uber’s driverless cars. “Travis’ vision was to build out the autonomous vehicles industry in 10 years,” Peduto said. “We shared a vision to do it in a way that would be a benefit for society.” Weeks later, in a meeting with President Barack Obama at a conference for the National League of Cities, Peduto urged Obama to support autonomous vehicles and declared Pittsburgh’s intention to be a testing ground. Since then, Pittsburgh has showed its friendliness to Uber’s efforts. Last year, it also worked with the city’s police department on plans to install a ride-hailing kiosk in the lively South Side district, for the use of people who had been drinking and would prefer not to drive home. Pittsburgh International Airport last year also designated waiting areas for Uber and Lyft passengers. Yet Uber has mostly gone ahead with its self-driving-car plans in Pittsburgh alone. Driverless cars with Uber’s logo have cruised around town for months, in part to get the public used to seeing them. With cameras and GPS units mounted on the roofs, the vehicles collect mapping data on plants and trees, the conditions of sidewalks, and traffic markings for nearly every street. “There’s really not been a whole lot of collaboration on the actual testing,” said Scott Schubert, Pittsburgh’s assistant chief of police, who rode in one of the Uber vehicles last June and signed a nondisclosure agreement to do so. Last month, Uber officially announced that the self-driving fleet would go into action in Pittsburgh. Peduto, who had been informed a few days earlier by Uber, sent a congratulatory text message to Kalanick. Uber’s chief was in Pittsburgh at the time and invited the mayor to be the city’s first driverless-car passenger. After the 2-mile ride home, Peduto posted on Twitter that he ended that day as the world’s first mayor chauffeured by an autonomous Uber car. “I feel fortunate that I have the ear of a CEO of one of the biggest privately held companies,” he said.

Founded in 1992, the company has become one of the most recognizable robotics firms in the world. Specializing in the study of locomotion, Boston Dynamics draws on the mechanics of flesh and blood bodies for inspiration. The resulting robots are often impressive and just a bit uncanny in their movements. Related: Boston Dynamics serves up the stuff of nightmares with its ‘dancing’ SpotMini robot The company has designed several robots for DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) and other military agencies, but the company’s profile has risen thanks to several videos showing off its robot in action, which tend to garner millions of views and a great deal of press coverage. BD was acquired by Google in 2013 as part of the tech titan’s expansion into robotics and other arcane projects. As of 2016, after the relationship between BD and Google apparently soured, Google has put the company up for sale. The future of Boston Dynamics is unknown, but given its astounding body of work, someone will undoubtedly be interested in acquiring them. For now, we can explore their diverse menagerie of machines, the cute, the creepy, the awe-inspiring. BigDog and LS3 One of the most famous Boston Dynamics creations, the BigDog is a large quadruped designed to carry equipment across rugged terrain. A mere three feet long, the BigDog was designed to carry up to 340 lbs. of equipment. It also runs at 4 mph and even climbs slopes of up to 35 degrees. The BigDog is remarkably capable of staying upright; when kicked, it stumbles a few feet before regaining its composure. This is thanks not only to its articulated legs but also an onboard computer which keeps track of joint positions, pressure on joints, and other factors. As a result, the BigDog adjusts its gait to walk on flat earth or trudge through snow depending on the situation. Its eventual successor, the Legged Squad Support System (LS3), is capable of carrying a heavier load (up to 400 lbs.) and enough fuel for a 20-mile trek. Funded by DARPA — which makes sense — the agency conceived them to theoretically assist squads trekking over long stretches of rough terrain. Unfortunately, the project eventually became shelved. After repeated testing by the U.S. Marine Corps, the LS3 was deemed too noisy for actual combat operations, as it could potentially give away a squad’s position. Petman Who is that man, strutting on a treadmill in the latest experimental hazard suit? ‘Tis no man at all, but Petman. Designed to test how chemical protection suits hold up under various human movements, Petman is an anthropomorphic robot created to perform various human movements such as walking, squatting, and even flexing. Like most of Boston Dynamics’ creations, it has the ability to move without assistance while keeping itself balanced. Weirdly enough, Petman does not just move like a human, it sweats like one. Petman has a tool to regulate the temperature and humidity inside suits, simulating the conditions an actual human body might produce under the same circumstances. Atlas Named for the Titan who held the world on his shoulders, Atlas is a humanoid robot built to walk, climb, and hoist objects. Standing 5’9” and weighing 180 lbs., Atlas strikes an imposing figure. Walking on two legs, the robot deftly strides across flat or uneven terrain, using its hands to open doors or grab objects. If pushed, Atlas boasts the capability to steady itself and if knocked over, it even pushes itself back up. If there are large objects like trees in the way, Atlas simply scales them. Atlas’ hands are useful for more than just grabbing and lifting. With various points of articulation, this robot even uses basic tools. Using onboard LIDAR and stereo sensors, Atlas navigates environments entirely on its own and identifies specific objects. Cheetah and WildCat Clocking in at 28.3 mph on a treadmill, BD’s Cheetah model is possibly the fastest running robot in the world. In keeping with the animal theme that runs through many of its projects, BD modeled this robot on the physiology of actual cheetahs. It features a slender, flexible spine which stretches and contracts, allowing the robot to take longer steps. Unfortunately, Cheetah required a tether to keep it centered and operational. Cheetah’s successor, the WildCat, is much bulkier and a bit slower (topping out at 19 mph), but it does also operate without a tether or any other form of assistance. The WildCat gallops, bounds, and even turns, allowing it much more freedom than the Cheetah. SandFlea Named for the genus of amphipods one may sometimes see hopping on beaches, SandFlea is a small, four-wheeled robot capable of leaping 30 feet into the air. Weighing in at only 11 lbs., the SandFlea uses a powerful piston actuator to launch itself and its rechargeable battery stores enough energy for 25 jumps. The SandFlea also has an onboard camera, allowing its operator to navigate it remotely and a computer which automatically keeps the robot stable during flight. Small enough to fit in a backpack, SandFlea has the potential to function as a scout, useful for urban military operations. RHex One of Boston Dynamic’s many experiments with building robots to traverse harsh terrain, RHex has six spinning legs that allow it to roll over pretty much any landscape imaginable. This small robot easily climbs over rocks and also trudges through mud or snow. Its sealed body allows it to move through wet environments without damage while its armored frame makes it resilient in case it falls down a slope. The RHex has front and rear-facing cameras and can be controlled remotely from a range of nearly 2300 feet. This makes it an excellent tool for scouting and exploring various environments. RiSE Modeled on a lizard, the RiSE model uses tiny claws in its six feet to climb surfaces without any tether required. With a small frame (it weighs roughly 4.5 lbs.) and powerful motors controlling each limb, RiSE climbs various surfaces, including trees and even stone walls. For those terrified that a robotic lizard might chase them up a building, fear not. RiSE only moves at a pace of about 0.3 m/s. RiSE is controlled by an onboard computer and possesses numerous sensors to keep track of its joints and any pressure on them. LittleDog This tiny robot cannot carry heavy loads like its BigDog cousin but it does serve a valuable purpose nonetheless. LittleDog’s small body contains a computer and various sensors capable of recording and transmitting information on the angles of its joints, pressure on them, and the robot’s orientation, among other things. Its highly articulated legs allow for various motions small and large which grant scientists the ability to use the LittleDog to study various aspects of locomotion on a wide range of surfaces. Spot/SpotMini One of Boston Dynamics’ more recent creations, Spot is a lithe, four-legged robot with highly flexible legs. It weighs 160 lbs. and navigates both indoor and outdoor environments. Like many BD robots, it also maintains its balance when kicked. The SpotMini is, as the name would suggest, is a smaller version of the robot, weighing 65 lbs. with its arm attached. The arm is one of the most recognizable parts of the SpotMini. It gives it the appearance of a skeletal giraffe while the head is actually more like a hand. The arm is highly flexible and the SpotMini uses it to grasp and move objects. The SpotMini is shockingly quiet as it moves — at least, relative to other robots like the LS3 — and it has a great range of motion. Flexible limbs allow Spot to move easily through various spaces, even crouching to walk under tables. Various sensors within the robot allow it to move and interact with objects autonomously.

Fresh criticism emerged this week that Clinton must have been hiding terrible things because one of her aides smashed two of her personal Blackberrys with a hammer. But from a data security perspective, that’s not a bad thing; in fact some experts say the discarded devices should have been destroyed more thoroughly. Meanwhile, House Oversight Committee leader Elijah Cummings released a 2009 email sent by former Secretary of State Colin Powell to Clinton in which he describes in detail all the ways he himself skirted State Department technology requirements. This week we grappled with the question of why Baltimore has become a bastion of surveillance tech. Over in the private sector, the Google-owned tech incubator Jigsaw is developing a program to try to identify ISIS recruits and deter them from joining the organization. And an op-ed contributor says it’s time to acknowledge that whoever wins the presidency will need to set new policy for autonomous weapons systems and their scope of use in warfare when the old Department of Defense Directive expires in 2017. But wait, there’s more: Each Saturday we round up the news stories that we didn’t break or cover in depth but still deserve your attention. As always, click on the headlines to read the full story in each link posted. And stay safe out there. Google Will Mark Unencrypted Websites “Insecure” Not too long ago, the standard for a secure website was to not offer gaping holes for hackers to exploit or infect visitors with malware. Now even plain-old HTTP itself, that venerable web protocol, is about to be considered insecure. Google has announced that its web browser Chrome will soon take a more aggressive stance on web encryption, marking any site as insecure if it doesn’t use HTTPS, a protocol that encrypts web pages with the encryption schemes SSL or TLS, and putting a red “X” over a padlock in the corner of the address bar. The rollout will begin in January by applying the rule to any site that asks for a password or credit card information. It will later expand to all sites when the user is browsing in Chrome’s incognito mode. Eventually, Chrome will label all HTTP sites as insecure. In other words, the web giant is taking a giant step toward a fully encrypted web and putting anyone who isn’t taking HTTPS seriously on notice: If your website isn’t already encrypted, start working on it or become the subject of shaming messages in millions of users’ browsers. Medical Equipment Company Sues Firm That Traded on Its Hackable Bugs In the long history of controversies over hackers who find and publicize hackable bugs, the case of St. Jude Medical and the finance firm Muddy Waters may be one of the messiest. Last month Muddy Waters and the security research firm MedSec teamed up to expose what they described as flaws in St. Judge’s pacemakers and defibrillators that could put patients’ lives in danger, potentially bricking the medical implants. And they went a step further: Muddy Waters also short-sold St. Jude’s stock, then profited from the resulting drop after the expose went public. Now St. Jude is firing back with a lawsuit accusing both the hackers and traders of illegal and damaging behavior like market manipulation and false accusations. Meanwhile, researchers at the University of Michigan published a rebuttal to MedSec prior to the lawsuit, claiming to refute some of the vulnerabilities MedSec found. Congress Issues Damning Post-Mortem on OPM Breach A hacker breach of the Office of Personnel Management that was revealed last year was the worst cyber attack on a federal agency in recent history, exposing as many as 22 million federal employees’ private records. Now a group of Republican members of Congress has released the results of its investigation into the attack and places the blame squarely on the agency’s management. The detailed postmortem runs through a series of known, unfixed security vulnerabilities in the agency’s systems prior to its discovery of hackers compromising its network in 2014 and describes how after OPM identified the initial breach and focused on containing the intrusion, another group of hackers ran rampant through its systems, eventually stealing millions of the highly personal background check records. The report lists the agency’s obstructions of the Office of the Inspector General, which investigated the breach, along with OPM’s misleading statements to Congress about its technology setup and security measures. White House Names First Federal Chief Information Security Officer As part of the Obama administration’s $19 billion Cybersecurity National Action Plan, the White House appointed its first federal chief information security officer. The position will be filled by retired Brigadier General Gregory J. Touhill, who was previously deputy assistant secretary for cybersecurity and communications in the Department of Homeland Security’s Office of Cybersecurity and Communications. As CISO he will report to Tony Scott, the federal chief information officer. Touhill’s goal will be to improve government network security, evaluate security measures at agencies across the government, and raise awareness nationally about the importance of cybersecurity. It’s not going to be an easy job if he does it right. DDoS-For-Hire Service Hacked, Revealing Shady Dealings and Customer Information The Isreali “booter” service vDOS, which offered to wage distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks for its clients, was itself hacked, exposing information about tens of thousands of customers and targets. The hack also leaked information about the company itself. Between April and July 2016, vDOS generated more than 277 million seconds of attack time, or almost nine years of malicious traffic, by maintaining multiple attack campaigns every day. As Krebs on Security puts it, “To say that vDOS has been responsible for a majority of the DDoS attacks clogging up the Internet over the past few years would be an understatement.” The company was breached by a hacker who had found a vulnerability in the server configuration data of another attack firm. He tried it on vDOS and it worked, allowing him to exploit an additional bug that gave him access to the company’s databases. vDOS has made over $600,000 in the past two years. Go Back to Top.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us CallJam malware now in Google Play, racks up cash for hackers thru premium calls By John Hoff - September 10, 2016 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter Google has a difficult job trying to make sure all the apps within the Google Play Store – which is the primary repository and app market for the Android ecosystem – are clean without any malware and malicious code that can potentially take advantage of and harm users. With a thousands upon thousands of app submissions for the Play Store, some malware still gets through. This new one is dubbed CallJam, and it basically racks up profit for the attackers by having your device call premium numbers. The CallJam malware is hidden inside the game “Gems Chest for Clash Royale” which was uploaded to Play in May. From the time it was uploaded, the app has been downloaded between 100,000 and 500,000 times. The malware system includes a premium dialer to generate fraudulent phone calls and an adnet capable for displaying ads to its victims to generate additional profit. First up, is able to redirect your browsing to malicious websites that generate revenue for attackers. The next step is a bit complicated, but it involves getting the user to grant the app permission to make premium calls. The problem here is that most users will just grant app permissions without reading the text. The hacker’s server then sends CallJam a command to dial a premium phone number and the desired length of the call. The malware initiates a call, generating profits for the hackers. As of now, the app is still available for download, so you should be warned. CheckPoint has already informed Google about this malware.

However, it looks like there’s another notable feature in there that ought to please Nexus 6P and Nexus 5X users on T-Mobile. Several Nexus 6P and Nexus 5X users have found that, after installing Android 6.0.1, their phones connect to T-Mobile’s band 12 coverage. xda-developers forum user papi92 posted some screenshots showing his Nexus 6P on Android 6.0.1 and T-Mobile band 12, and Reddit users 77random77 and nps-ca say that their Nexus 5Xs are accessing band 12 after installing Android 6.0.1. Neither Google nor T-Mobile have made any official announcements regarding T-Mo band 12 LTE support in the Android 6.0.1 update, so for now consider this all unconfirmed. Google and T-Mobile previously said that they were working on enabling band 12 on both phones, though, with members of Google’s Nexus team aiming to roll out band 12 support by the time that the 6P and 5X shipped to customers. Obviously that didn’t happen since the phones have been in owners’ hands for a few weeks now, but that does support the theory that band 12 support is included with the Android 6.0.1 update since it’s being rolled out shortly after the 6P and 5X launch. If you’ve got a Nexus 6P or 5X, be sure to keep an eye out for your Android 6.0.1 update in the coming days. If you’re in a hurry and don’t mind doing a bit of work, you can manually flash the 6.0.1 factory image to your phone. Just keep in mind that doing so will wipe your phone’s data totally clean. If you’ve got a Nexus 6P or 5X, is your phone connecting to T-Mobile’s band 12 coverage after the Android 6.0.1 update?

Washout It won’t take 2 months. Should be out in the upcoming week. It’s the monthly security update. As for the radios, the Nexus 6 are has band 12 active and it works great. My battery life has been even better with 6.0 so I’m not to sure where your problems are coming from. Nexus 6 has been a great phone. hristopelov im not saying is bad, is been great. software radio/modems (nothing to do with band 12) are new every update, unless is just security update bit this one is not.. dboy rusky My phone choses band 4 over 12 if both available so above statement is incorrect Brett Schulte It’s supposed to. Band 4 is preferred. Mark Grr my 6p thinks it’s still up-to-date. Currently on band 4 out in a rural town. LTE comes and goes sporadically. Band 12 will help so much, especially since it was just enabled in Sacramento ~40 miles away. David they roll out in batches, otherwise all the new phones download update will crash the server. So google spread out the server load. Mark Yeah, my Nexus 9 didn’t get the 6.0 update for about a week. That was fine. Knowing Band 12 is within reach is just so darn exciting. Joe I understand the excitement of band 12 but for now you will be disappointed as it is much slower and will connect even when good band 4 or 2 signal is available. It will be much more exciting and useful when carrier aggregation is enabled so you can have speed and reliability all together. Medion It has less to do with server load. A Google exec gave an interview on this a year or so ago. They hit 1% on the first batch, then slowly ramp up to 100% over 2-3 weeks. If any issues are detected during the smaller rollout, the OTA is halted. The most notable that I can remember was the KitKat OTA for the Nexus 4, which hit 1% then was halted for unknown issues, before resuming a few weeks later (allowing some phones like the first GPE devices and the Moto X to essentially get KitKat first). shrike1978 It’s called a soak test. All the carriers do it too. You can test all you want in a lab, but you can’t fully replicate all scenarios until it’s in the wild. vrm you have no idea how google’s business works- if any one can handle the traffic and volume, it is google. marque2 He is right about the way Google distributes new builds. Having all Nexus phones in the family we experience this all the time where my Nexus 4 gets the update weeks before or after my wife’s Nexus 5. She got the update last week and I am still waiting on my 5x. It is part of the tradeoff. We get updates first, but Google rolls it out slowly and waits for bug reports to come in. They have stopped rollouts before. Has nothing to do with Google bandwidth. patt you can flash factory images few minutes and you are good to go Brett Schulte I’m still waiting too. Kyng Just got the ota an hour ago. Derek i’d be grateful for ota links so i could sideload the 5X. this is a painful wait for some band 12 love. patt flash factory images Derek boot loader isn’t unlocked, don’t have time to reinstall/setup everything again. :-( normally i unlock right when i get a new nexus…forgot. Andrew band 12 showing up for me in some areas of seattle with 6.0.1 it’s nice when it’s there, but there isn’t much of it still. Medion Yup. Didn’t do me any good in Seattle as I already have good signal there. Still no LTE on any band in Federal Way near The Commons. Disk Crasher Seeing band 12 near Five Mile Lake. Derek Links available now to download the OTA and sideload if you are unrooted, locked bootloader, etc. http://www.androidpolice.com/2015/12/08/flash-all-the-things-android-6-0-1-marshmallow-nexus-and-android-one-ota-roundup/ HeatFan786 I actually saw Band 12 before that update through the original update that was pushed out in November. Idk if Band 12 is on or not from that. Just hope T-Mobile gives it to all the Nexus 5Xs. patt Hey TMO guys how come band12, is so slow ? I am with Verizon now and want to pull the switch. Also b13 seems to be much stronger. Why? Person Band 12 is slow because of its low bandwith. (5mhz). Verizon has from 10 to 20 mhz of band 13 varying from region to region. This allows higher data transmission rates and allows for moremore network capacity as well. T-Mobiles main LTE band is Band 4. It has from 10-20mhz of it again. Region by region. It has worse signal reach, but is stupid fast. Band 12 is just t-mobiles way of plugging up holes in band 4 coverage. patt yea place where I spend some time has weak B12 -117 -123 which is almost unusable. It’s inside the building of course. Everywhere else signal is good,even where I live. This is NYC area SirStephenH Low band is also slower than mid or high band. 10Mhz of band 12 will always be slower than 10Mhz of band 2 or 4. TechnoRealz Is lower bandwidth considered 12 or 2/4? marque2 Band 12 is 700Mhz. I believe band 4 is 1900. marque2 Your comment makes no sense. The Mhz rates are 700 and 1900. The higher frequency can support higher data rates, currently up to 40Mb/s with 2 channels. It will go higher as technology improves. The theoretical maxi.um is 350 Mb/S and 950 Mb/s but this will never quite be achieved because error correcting and handshaking protocols take up some bandwidth and making the length of the bitsntoo small will result in too many bit transmission errors. Derek TMO just called me and said that 5X does not support 700A block and so I cannot get signal unless I am in a 700B area where my 5X can function on the Band 12. WTF Medion No one from T-Mobile called you just to comment on band 12 compatibility. Derek Correct. I didn’t think this warranted my whole reason for communicating with TMO. I emailed the president email and someone called. My purpose was lack of signal in a South Florida suburb of Oakland Park. No band 12 in buildings following updates. marque2 There are parts of Florida without Band 12. Nexus 5x most definitely supports it, the issue is whether Google implements VoLTE. T-Mobile refuses to allow Band 12 to be turned on until VoLTE is certified for the phone, because it is needed to insure you can call 911, since band 12 is data only. Derek Agreed. I’m not disputing anything here. I’m just saying that TMO gave a bullshit excuse for poor band 12 here following the ota which activated it for me. The agent claimed the 5x solely supports block b and not block a of the 700mhz spectrum. He said that all of their spectrum is block a and I need to buy a TMO branded phone. This was from a dude working in el presidentes office. Point is that TMO notes are totally insane or its people are clueless or they are pushing other hardware with bullshit excuses. marque2 The guy had no clue then. Where I live in San Diego there is no band 12 either. T Mobile is still trying to buy the spectrum from a spectrum squatter. I wish I had the update before my business trip to CT last week though, where they do have band 12 – lots of hills and valleys and plenty of spots where band 4 won’t reach. Derek This is great. So, the guy calls back just now. “Google has not passed the certification yet, so the phone is unable to use Band 12. If you want a Nexus 5X, we have T-Mobile branded 5X phones available that are certified for Band 12.” … “This is why you are unable to use Band 12 completely in South Florida.” …. “Your account does not have all of Band 12 enabled because of the certification.” T-Mobile is really, really, really starting to annoy me. marque2 I got my update yesterday. It will be difficult for me to confirm band 12 though. San Diego doesn’t have it, and where I work in Orange county does, however I get band 4 just fine. Irfan december 14 2015 no update yet ,this time Google sucks .. jeremy Try being on Note 4 android 5.0.1….. xgudwilx Just got my update on my N6Perfect… Now tell me what to look for and how I will benefit..

Live feed Show 4.42am EDT 04:42 Night-time politics Well it has been quite some first speech by the Justice party senator Derryn Hinch. Having said he would not use parliamentary privilege to behave like a cowboy, he named convicted paedophiles and sex offenders to call for a national register of sex offenders. He gave a passionate address defending free speech while denouncing Islamic terrorism, domestic violence, genital mutilation and live exports. It was a clear sign that Hinch will continue to act inside the parliament exactly the same way as he has outside the parliament. Watch out. The Coalition has revealed its cost-benefit analysis of moving the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority (APVMA) to the deputy prime minister’s electorate of New England has itself cost $272,000. Joyce had earlier suggested he would not release the analysis but the treasurer, Scott Morrison, said it would be up for cabinet consideration tonight. In question time Labor attacked Malcolm Turnbull’s record in the prime ministership while the Coalition attacked Bill Shorten’s handling of the Sam Dastyari affair. Two sides of the Liberal party argued over marriage equality, specifically whether the “yes” and “no” cases should be funded. After a number of church representatives suggested Turnbull offered to fund the cases, conservatives tried to push the PM into funding the cases. At the same time, Labor and the crossbenchers brought marriage equality private member’s bills before the parliament. The auditor general reported to Labor that he had reviewed the public information relating to the Liberal software company Parakeelia and there was nothing to see here. It was not an audit, just a review, though we did find out Parakeelia had loaned $200,000 to the party to help with a cash flow problem. They need to pay it back this financial year. Federal director Tony Nutt said considering the finding, Bill Shorten and frontbencher Brendan O’Connor should withdraw their statements and apologise to the Liberal party. That’ll do pig. One day down. Three more sitting days to go. Thanks to the brains trust Katharine Murphy, Paul Karp and Gareth Hutchens. Mike Bowers, take a bow. Thank you for your company.

The other bills only allow ministers of religion to refuse to conduct gay weddings. Leyonhjelm said he was in favour of discrimination law where it prevented a publican from refusing to serve a beer to an Aboriginal person. Asked what the difference was, Leyonhjelm said: We generally distinguish between discrimination on the basis of who you want to marry, which is a sort of lower level. He said refusing to provide services to a gay wedding was a “substantially lower order” than discrimination based on race – because you’re born with your race but “you’re not born with the desire to get married to someone of the same gender”. The difference was between “material discrimination and nice not to do discrimination”. I’ve never known a straight guy yet that hasn’t discriminated against ugly girlfriends – we all discriminate, it’s part of life. The question is where we impose the law in that. Discrimination is normal, it is what we all do as human beings.

MintTwist Menu Skip to content Home Archive Guest post Monday 21st February 2011 by Colin Cheng The Next Big Search Engine? For a long time Google has been the undisputed heavyweight in search.  Ever since it was first launched more than ten years ago, it has won over fans with its simple interface and focus of returning the most relevant results in the quickest time.  Google has definitely helped the Internet’s association with the fast, almost instant, availability of information. When Google first launched, there were a number of competitors vying for the lion’s share of online search – Yahoo, AOL, MSN, Ask, Alta Vista, Lycos and many more.  Google seemed to arrive and blow everyone else out of the water and show no signs of slowing.  It’s now almost impossible to imagine using the Internet without Google – it ranks as the number one website for many countries according to Alexa.  Its market share of search is as much as 85% globally and it continues to provide new services such as Maps, Places, Gmail and Docs.  Google has now even become immortalised in the English language with the verb ‘to google’. What happened to the other search engines then?  Yahoo continues to be a key player in the US especially.  However, its usage seems to be slowly losing ground to competitors.  Microsoft’s newly re-launched search service, Bing, is expected to leapfrog Yahoo in the next 12 months to be the second largest search engine.  Check below to see a table showing the top search engines in the US for December 2010 (according to comScore): As you can see, Google totally dominates the US search market. But what about globally? Based on Net Market Share data for 2010, we can see that Google performs even better worldwide than in the US: Google has an unprecedented market share – no other search engine even comes close! Interestingly, you can see that Chinese search engine Baidu ranks at number three. This is an amazing achievement considering the narrow demographic it caters to (bearing in mind Baidu is largely only used in China whilst Google is global). What next for the online search industry? Well, it is hard to imagine any other search engine being able to dislodge Google’s strong hold but let’s look at some hypothetical contenders: 1. Bing Yes, Bing! Although probably not going to beat Google, many people forecast it to become the second most used search engine soon. Coupled with the merger with Yahoo and it is easy to see how Bing will become more of a competitor for Google. 2. Baidu Baidu is arguably the most significant contender to Google. Whilst it may only reign supreme in China, China’s population is expected to grow and its economy recently dislodged Japan as the world’s second largest – arguably whoever can crack the Chinese Internet market is in for a good future. What will be key though is if Baidu can branch out to other geographies. Interestingly, its ranking in other neighbouring areas is less significant. According to Alexa it is the 7th most popular in Hong Kong whilst only being 9th in South Korea and 15th in Taiwan. Baidu’s growth overseas will be the most important factor in determining whether it will be a genuine competitor to Google or not. 3. YouTube Yes, I know it is not technically a search engine but you do search on it! Interestingly, YouTube recently become the second largest search engine in terms of monthly searches performed. This represents a huge shift in the way people are searching for information. As broadband becomes the norm and advertisers continue to embrace online media, media-rich content is becoming standard. YouTube (which Google owns) highlights two things about the Internet. Firstly, Internet users enjoy communicating and secondly, text is no longer enough. Neither is animated gifs. For SEOs, web marketers and anyone associated with the web world – ignoring the power of YouTube and multi-media search may prove to be a mistake. 4. Facebook Last but not least, a small website you might not have heard of yet. Facebook’s growth has been unparalleled – adding hundreds of thousands of users daily. At the moment, Facebook is still very much centred around users and people. You can’t search for information in the same way but more and more information is getting uploaded to Facebook pages for people to ‘like’. Additionally, Facebook gives companies and individuals the ability to speak directly to visitors in a way that is not often afforded to them on websites and traditional media. So there we have it! Google is probably going to continue to be the undisputed search behemoth but there are numerous contenders vying for second place. What will be most interesting is to see how traditional search engine alternatives develop. As Facebook gears up to launch its new communication platform (including emails), does this signify Facebook’s intent to become the new Google? We will have to wait and see!

MintTwist Menu Skip to content Home Archive Guest post Tuesday 15th September 2009 by Elliott King Is a second wave of world Browser Wars heading our way?… … Maybe. Although this time it will be more complex. IE and FireFox are the dominant incumbents and Google’s Chrome is the rising super-power. However, dig a little deeper and you’ll see there are more potential players in the battle for world domination. Are we heading for a second wave of browser wars? “The issue that lies ahead is whether browsers will remain a relatively simple window on to the internet or become intelligent agents that shape online experiences. If they go down the latter route this would have potentially disruptive effects for others who do business on the internet”, said Alexis Pratsides of MintTwist Digital. For the internet’s booming social networking industry in particular, the prospect that some of the capabilities associated with social networking will be embedded into browsers, making them more aware of users’ interests and social relationships, could force difficult strategic decisions. Google’s main contribution to the browser skirmishes we’ve seen thus far has been an obsession with speed. With a new, faster engine for executing Javascript – the code that makes it possible for a browser to imitate applications that run on a PC – Google galvanised the rest of the industry and forced rivals to focus harder on their own core technology. Google’s goal, as it takes on Microsoft, is clear – to accelerate the advances in the internet platform in ways that eventually make it unnecessary to run “native” software applications that rely on a PC’s underlying operating system. That, ultimately, should benefit the web-based services on which its success depends. Others, however, see deeper potential in the browser and are out to push its capabilities further. As a piece of software that all users have to use – it clearly has a strong strategic position. For instance, Mozilla, the maker of the Firefox browser, says it is looking into arming its browser with a number of extra munitions – such as ‘knowing who you are and handling authentication on the websites you visit, keeping a record of your social network so that you can interact with friends; and, making it easier for you to share content with your network. Given that these are all territories that social networks like Facebook currently view as their own, that could create new fronts opening up between browser makers and the internet services that rely on them. If it makes life easier for internet users, bringing more capabilities into the browser will be hard to resist and populations of internet users may start to migrate away from using artificial silos [like Facebook, Twitter or LinkedIn]. This has attracted a flurry of interest and investment in browsers from the social networking big guns. The potential for “social browsers” is a currently a hot topic in Silicon Valley. The internet industry has long nurtured a feeling of mutual growth and co-operation; but there’s a growing evidence that the time may be coming for players to choose sides, ready themselves and prepare for war! MintTwist help medium sized product and service based businesses to increase revenue and sales leads by defeating their enemies on the battlefields of the internet with better web design and web marketing services.

Post navigation Twitter sets to roost in London Good intentions won’t sell Windows 7 3 thoughts on “Is a second wave of world Browser Wars heading our way?…” technogran says: Tuesday 15th September 2009 at 13:40 One browser that has incorporated all of your social networking sites for at least the last five years and is streets ahead on this is Flock. http://www.flock.com Trouble is because its run by a very small outfit, they have to rely on users ‘spreading the word’ as it were which explains why hardly anyone knows of its existance. this is a shame as it works brilliantly in bringing all of your social world together in one place. Reply NextPoint says: Monday 21st September 2009 at 15:06 It’s about time that IE has some competition. This will be good for the web design and development industry all around – as long as there is fair competition. Once people start to use browsers that are more standards compliant, it will become less expensive to develop websites and web applications, plus new ways for how the Internet can be used will emerge. With this emerging model of the Internet as a software platform, costs of software development will also fall because developers will only need to target one platform that can run on any operating system and device type – whether it be a desktop PC, mobile phone, games console, DVD player or TV. Reply get clever says: Tuesday 22nd September 2009 at 8:46 Internet users are definitely becoming more browser savvy and it will definitely be led by the social networking generation. Who knows, perhaps they’ll drag some of the larger, lazier IT departments still lagging behind with IE6 into the 21st century… here’s hoping! I think there’s still some way to go with regard to our broadband infrastructure before fully remote software could be a reliable and truly fast option though.

MintTwist Menu Skip to content Home Archive Guest post Wednesday 23rd December 2009 by alexispratsides Google To Display Tweets in Search Results Google has signed a deal with Twitter and will begin displaying tweets in Google search results. The announcement is generating mixes reactions among SEO professionals and site owners. Google made the very brief announcement in their official blog about the Twitter Deal as part of their goal to “create the most comprehensive, relevant and fast search in the world.” While it will be interesting to see what they do with Twitter tweets, I seriously doubt if this will bring them closer to reaching their goal. For those not familiar with Twitter, it is a micro-blogging site that might be better described as a micro-messaging site. It is based on a cell phone text messaging model and limits the length of a message to 140 characters. Messages are called “tweets.” Links can be included to tweets, but the length of the URL is part of the 140 character limit. Online URL shortening tools are commonly used to add very brief URLs that are then redirected to the final destination page. In order to receive someone’s tweets, the user must sign up for a Twitter account and then voluntarily sign up to “follow” another Twitter user’s tweets. Twitter can be effectively used to drive traffic to a web site if enough targeted users can be persuaded to sign up as followers. The main problem with Twitter is that the overwhelming majority of tweets are useless dribble. While it is an ideal medium for celebrities and politicians to get their message out, do we really need to know that one of them is eating a ham sandwich or about to leave to go grocery shopping? At this point, we do not know how Google will display tweets in their search results. They may cluster them together like they currently tend to do with YouTube videos. The problem is that they may just clutter up search results and push web site pages further down in rank positions. Do not expect to be able to use Twitter to build links to your site. All outbound links from the major social media sites are blocked in one fashion or another so that they do not pass any link value. In the case of Twitter, all links are nullified with a “nofollow” attribute. That effectively eliminates any link value that might otherwise be passed. It may be safe to assume that Google will do something similar with tweets that show up in their search results. The real question is, “How will Google determine which tweets make it into their search results?” This could be based upon some Twitter internal ranking criteria, similar to the way that YouTube videos are ranked. It could be based upon the number of followers that forward a particular tweet to their followers. The most logical assumption is that keyword phrases in the tweets will be part of the ranking algorithm. Advice: Start including targeted keywords and links to destination pages in your tweets. Until we can determine how Google will select a few choice tweets from the millions of useless tweets generated each day, it would be wise to make sure that each tweet that you send includes targeted keywords and a link to the appropriate page in your web site. It might also be a good idea to make sure that your most important targeted keyword phrases are included in the description in your Twitter account. Microsoft announced similar deals with both Twitter and FaceBook for Microsoft’s Bing search engine, so it appears that a trend may be emerging.

How do you stop a potential ISIS recruit? With information. That's Google's new plan to stop potential recruits before they become radicalized, reports Wired. Over the last year, Google's tech incubator, Jigsaw (formerly Google Ideas), has developed a program that will use a combination of Google’s search advertising algorithms and YouTube’s video platform to target aspiring recruits. The goal is to dissuade them from joining the Islamic State group, also know as ISIS or ISIL, by arming them with accurate information on the terrorist organization. The program is called The Redirect Method. Basically, advertising is placed alongside search results for any keywords and phrases for which Jigsaw believes people attracted to ISIS commonly search. The ads link to Arabic and English-language YouTube channels. Each channel has preexisting videos that Jigsaw believes can effectively undo ISIS’ propaganda. The videos include clips from interviews with defectors, imams denouncing ISIS’ corruption of Islam, and other material that showcase the hypocrisy of ISIS. Jigsaw has created a list of more than 1,700 keywords that trigger ads leading to its anti-ISIS playlists. According to Jigsaw, this year's pilot program for the Redirect Method was incredibly effective. Over two months, more than 300,000 people were drawn to the anti-ISIS YouTube channels. Searchers clicked on Jigsaw’s ads three or four times more often than a typical ad campaign. According to Yasmin Green, Jigsaw's head of research and development, the Redirect Method doesn’t seek to track those searching for the terms or identify them — and it isn’t designed to lead to arrests or surveillance. “These are people making decisions based on partial, bad information,” Green told Wired. “We can affect the problem of foreign fighters joining the Islamic State by arming individuals with more and better information.” Advertisement Living • Tech Photographed by Kate Anglestein.

Welcome along to coverage all the main action in Rio this evening. Before taking a peak at what’s to come, a look at what has gone on today – for those of a British persuasion, it has been another impressive day with three rowing golds and two more in the velodrome to take GB’s tally to 20, and 46 overall. Amongst the winners was Rachel Morris, 37, who became a Paralympic champion in her second sport after adding single sculls gold to her cycling time-trial in Beijing eight years ago. Lauren Rowles and Laurence Whiteley won in the mixed double sculls before the mixed coxless fours grabbed more glory. Rachel Morris leads the way as Britain win three Rio rowing golds Read more In cycling, Britain rode to the men’s mixed sprint team gold with the riders Jody Cundy, Jon Allan-Butterworth and Louis Rolfe setting a world record time in beating the defending champions, China. That came on the back of a surprise win for Lora Turnham and her pilot Corrine Hall, who were all smiles as they admitted they were stunned to beat the favourites from New Zealand in the women’s tandem B 3km pursuit final. Other notable moments in Rio today include the women’s triathlon, the first time the event has been staged in a Paralympic Games. The PT4 was won by Grace Norman of the USA who edged out Britain’s Lauren Steadman, while Allysa Seely won the PT2 event in an American 1-2-3. Lucy Ejike won the women’s 61kg powerlifting title for Nigeria earlier in the day, while in athletics Thailand’s Prawat Wahoram won his country’s second gold of the Games in the men’s T54 5000m final. China continued their dominance with Juan Yao claiming women’s F44 discus gold, but the loudest cheer of the day so far was saved for Brazil’s Petrucio Ferreira Dos Santos, who stormed to gold in the men’s T47 100m final. What has all that done to the medal table? Well China are still well out in front with GB second and Ukraine third, as Brazil leap to fifth overall.

Sep 11th 2016, 7:00 PM 45,023 Views 10 Comments Share112 Tweet Email8 Image: Rachel Johnson EMAIL DELIVERS AS much website traffic for Irish e-commerce businesses as every social media network combined, according to a new study. Research by digital marketing agency Wolfgang Digital found that email, which was first used in the early 1970s, is also the third-biggest driver for online revenue, behind Google search and direct web traffic. “Advertisers often get caught up chasing the shiny new thing, but email just seems to be really solid,” study author and Wolfgang CEO Alan Coleman told Fora. Wolfgang Digital CEO Alan Coleman Source: Dave Keegan/Wolfgang Digital The report – which looked at data from Harvey Norman, Lifestyle Sports, Littlewoods Ireland and other websites – found that 6% of overall revenue is generated through email, while Facebook delivers just 2% of revenue. “If you think about it, when you post something on social media, your reach is quite low,” Coleman said. “With Facebook, if you’re posting organically – if you’re not paying for it – it could be less than 5% of the people who follow you that will see it. But when you email it, you’re pretty sure everybody is going to at least see the headline in their inbox.” When repeat customers, or direct traffic, are excluded, email is second only to Google in terms of generating sales. “If you get Google right and you get email right, that’s about three-quarters of your revenue looked after,” Coleman said. Source: Wolfgang Digital Mobile Wolfgang Digital analysed 87 million e-commerce website sessions for the 12-month period ending 31 June. Facebook dominated in the social media category: it was the only social network to register as a traffic source for websites, accounting for 5% of overall visitors. Other sites like Twitter and Instagram were below 1%. Unsurprisingly, mobile provided the bulk share of web traffic – 42% – but it underperformed when it came to revenue, generating just over 20% of sales. That said, Coleman argued that there is a strong indication that consumers use mobile to make a buying decision but carry out the actual purchase on a desktop computer. Source: Wolfgang Digital Website speed He also disputed the figures that many marketers use to measure website performances. “Digital marketers obsess over bounce rate, the number of people leaving your website,” he said. “People feel an awful sense of rejection when they see a high bounce rate. There’s an assumption there that all bounces are bad. This is a fallacy.” He said there is “zero correlation between bounce rate and conversion”, the number of customers who click on a webpage and make a purchase. It is more important for e-commerce businesses to improve their site speed, he argued. “As websites go faster, people are more likely to buy.  For every two tenths of a second you reduce your server response time, your conversion rate goes up 8%.” The average load time for pages analysed in the report was 6.5 seconds – significantly less than the two-second recommendation from Google. “Google loves fast websites,” Coleman said. “If you improve your site speed, your Google ranking will start increasing so it will have a multiplying effect on your bottom line.” Written by Conor McMahon and posted on Fora.ie Take me to Fora Get breaking news from TheJournal.ie via Facebook.

Naturally, this will give site operators cause to finally move on from HTTPS to technologies that make the browsing experience safe for their visitors. Google has confirmed that it’s going to flag plain HTTP connections as insecure with the release of Chrome 56 in January 2017. Initially, Chrome 56 is going to flag these connections as “not secure” when they are accessed in Chrome’s Incognito mode. The company’s data shows that almost half of the billions of pages that are loaded by its users are encrypted using HTTPS and that websites are increasingly adopting this advanced security protocol, however, a lot more needs to be done to ensure that almost all websites use HTTPS to secure connections. Chrome is eventually going to display the warning for all HTTP pages and will also swap the security indicator to a red triangle which it currently uses for broken HTTPS connections. “Studies show that users do not perceive the lack of a ‘secure’ icon as a warning, but also that users become blind to warnings that occur too frequently,” writes Chrome Security Team member Emily Schechter in a blog post.

But traveling on two wheels can be dangerous - not least due to aggressive drivers, says DW columnist Gero Schliess. The capital needs more and better bike lanes, he says. If you want to get to know the Berliners, then get on a bike. Recently, after a long and delicious event at the Italian embassy, I cycled home to the district of Prenzlauerberg. It was already late, and it was a long way. In the dark, I pedaled through a couple of red lights to make up time - to the annoyance of a few drivers whose honks are still ringing in my ears. Gero Schliess' Berlin 24/7 column appears weekly I distinctly remember a brief conversation I had at the intersection of the famous Unter den Linden boulevard and Spandauer Strasse, not far from Alexanderplatz. An athletic middle-aged woman, obviously an experienced Berlin cyclist, stopped at a red light and yelled at me, "I saw you rode through red lights twice. Are you drunk or do you want to get yourself killed?" That was it. I admit I'd had a few glasses of good Chianti, but that didn't mean I wanted to go down in history as Berlin's drunk night cyclist. That's why I opened my mouth and affirmed the latter, which I reckoned would be the lesser evil. "Then you should call the crisis helpline," she retorted as she rode off. No orientation without Google Maps Berlin can get very dark at night Riding a bike in Berlin can be quite an adventure, especially if you're not that familiar with the city. But don't rely too much on tools like Google Maps - especially when it gets dark. Nevertheless, many newcomers like to try the out the app. Of course, there's something very comforting about the monotone Google voice telling you where to go. "Turn left on Scharounstrasse," says Google, "then turn right on Potsdamer Strasse." What follows is an endless chain of right turns and left turns until the houses and lights gradually disappear and you find yourself in utter darkness. At that moment, your phone battery starts to die. Berliners are demanding safer bike paths That's what happened to me when I was heading towards a new park somewhere in Berlin. It was a recreation center with playgrounds and skating lanes that's buzzing with life during the day, but gets spooky at night. While I was dodging ghouls in the park, Google Maps said I'd be home in bed in 17 minutes. But it actually took twice as long and - thanks to my phone's weak batteries - I nearly had to sleep under a bridge. Not enough room for cyclists Cyclists who have been living in Berlin for years have different worries. Biking in Berlin is a permanent struggle with car drivers. Here, they seem a bit more aggressive and self-assured than elsewhere in Germany. People scream and swear at each other - and sometimes quarrels even get physical. Both cyclists and drivers contribute to unsafe roads Berlin has turned into a dangerous place for cyclists. But bossy drivers aren't the only danger. Careless bike riders - like the author of this column, who is slowly feeling guilty - are another. Over the past few years, the number of cyclists has doubled in Berlin. Many streets are crowded and crammed, which can leads to life-threatening situations. That's why a petition demanding more bicycle lanes has already got more than 100,000 signatures - five times more than necessary. 10 traffic-related cycling deaths occured last year in Berlin Residents are asking for safer bike lanes that don't jeopardize people's lives. The petition is supported by the opposition Greens party, which has long been at loggerheads with the city government under the ruling Social Democrats and Christian Democrats. The city administration, in turn, says the lanes would cost too much. But the discussions have been dragging on for too long. It's time for change. Last year, 48 people in Berlin were killed in traffic accidents - and 10 of them were cyclists.

 A former Tesla and Google exec who worked for George Bush explains why he wants Republicans to vote for Hillary Kif Leswing Sep. 11, 2016, 1:07 PM 11,724 facebook linkedin twitter email print Republicans for Hillary co-founder Ricardo Reyes in Washington DC. AP Donald Trump's business background is one of his main selling points, but that hasn't been enough to endear him among many Silicon Valley business leaders.  The Republican presidential nominee is running a pessimistic campaign, whereas the default outlook of Silicon Valley is optimism, according to Ricardo Reyes, a tech industry insider who previously headed communications for Tesla, Google's YouTube, and Square.  Reyes is not some techie progressive. A longtime Republican, Reyes served in the Bush administration.  Now he's one of the cofounders of Republicans for Clinton, a self-described grassroots network of Republican voters who are actively supporting Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Silicon Valley "is a very accepting culture, you have different people from different walks of life, you have different people from different cultures all kind of working together. It really is a melting pot of cultures here. And that kind of rejects that whole view he has," Reyes told Business Insider. The fact that high-profile Silicon Valley Republicans like Reyes are actively opposing Trump highlights a big challenge facing the candidate as he tries to broaden his appeal to voters. While tech investor Peter Thiel endorsed Trump at the Republican National Convention, outward signs of support for Trump in the Valley are otherwise tough to find (one tech worker Business Insider spoke to said that he had to hide his support for Trump because the candidate is so unpopular in Silicon Valley). "Let's talk about the make-up of Silicon Valley. Let's think about who actually comes out to CA and works out here. These are typically very risk tolerant individuals. They believe in opportunity. They actually don't believe this whole 'Make America Great Again' thing," Reyes says.  Trump's isolationist and anti-free trade stances might also be scaring the big tech companies. "What you have here is a bunch of companies that think at a very global scale and when you break down his arguments on isolationism and how we need to pull back from our international partnerships, that just doesn't fly here," Reyes said. Notable tech company execs including Alphabet Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg, and Apple CEO Tim Cook have all endorsed Clinton.  Republicans for Clinton  Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks to an overflow crowd during a campaign rally, Tuesday, Sept. 6, 2016, in Greenville, N.C. Evan Vucci/AP Before Reyes became a Silicon Valley crisis communicator, he worked in the Bush administration, in a position advising on trade communications. Before that, he edited Regulation Magazine, a Cato Institute publication.  When he started working in tech, he thought he had left Washington DC behind. But the "threat of a Trump presidency" was so egregious to him that he had to get involved — on behalf of Clinton. "When I left Washington I dedicated myself to the private sector," Reyes said.  Republicans for Clinton isn't a big PAC. In fact, it only recently started taking donations. Instead, Reyes says the strategy is to hold events in swing states, especially to help Republicans down the ballot, and place editorials in influential publications.  "What we're trying to ensure is that Trump is defeated, that Hillary wins the presidential election, but also that good, down-ballot Republicans don't suffer too much at the ballot box because of Trump's unpopularity," Reyes says.  Recently, Republicans for Clinton co-founder John Stubbs placed an editorial in the Washington Post, for example. Republicans for Clinton also supports Jim Glassman, a Clinton endorser and American Enterprise Institute fellow who goes on TV often, and other notable Republicans. Reyes says his organization is in "loose communication" with the official Clinton campaign, mostly through third-parties.  Reyes thinks that Bush-era Republicans and Silicon Valley libertarians have a lot in common — although he's not supporting Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson, who he says has a "progressive mindset."  "People should be trusted to make the best decisions for themselves. That was a very strong Republican tenant but it is also a very strong technology tenant," Reyes said. "We believe in individual responsibility, individual liberty, individual freedom. Sadly, none of the things that Donald Trump seems to believe."

Mobile Search  News  SEO August 30, 2016 Mobile Search News SEO Matt SouthernAugust 30, 2016 SEJ STAFF 401SHARES 1.0KREAD 401SHARES 1.0KREAD SEJ STAFFMatt Southern 401SHARES 1.0KREAD Last week, Google announced it will be rolling out a penalty in mobile search targeted at web pages featuring full-page interstitials (intrusive pop-up ads). This penalty will come into effect after January 10, 2017, and there has been some confusion as to whether or not AdSense Page-level ads will be affected. The questions was asked on Twitter, and Google’s John Mueller gave a somewhat vague response: @bonirulzz @googlewmc What's important to us is the effect as described in our blog post, no matter where it comes from. — John Mueller (@JohnMu) August 28, 2016 The effect as described in Google’s blog post does not exactly apply to AdSense Page-level ads. There are two types of Page-level ads: anchor/overlay ads and vignette ads. Google’s official documentation describes anchor/overlay ads as: “mobile ads that stick to the edge of the user’s screen and are easily dismissible.” Since anchor/overlay ads to not cover a user’s entire screen, there’s no discernible reason why pages featuring those ads should fall victim to Google’s upcoming penalty. For that matter, neither should vignette ads, which Google describes as being “displayed when the user leaves a page, rather than when they arrive on one, so the user doesn’t have to wait for them to load.” With that being said, it should help clear up the confusion people may have about AdSense Page-level ads being affected by the interstitials penalty. While anchor/overlay ads appear immediately upon arrival, they do not cover the entire screen. Vignette ads do cover the entire screen, but only appear upon departure. Pages utilizing either type of ad should, in theory, be in the clear once the new penalty rolls out.

 The subtle way Google plans to use its greatest skill to combat ISIS Jillian D'Onfro Sep. 11, 2016, 12:00 PM 7,289 facebook linkedin twitter email print Yasmin Green, head of research and development at Jigsaw Jigsaw The 13-year-old girl's explanation for why she had decided to leave her happy family in London to fly East and join ISIS was frighteningly naive: "She told me, 'Well, I was looking at photos online and I thought I was going to go live in the Islamic Disneyworld,'" quotes Yasmin Green, head of research and development at Jigsaw, the think-tank spun out of Google earlier this year.  "It's so incredible because what you and I see in the media, nothing would support the impression that this is an 'Islamic Disneyworld,'" Green says. "But this is what this 13-year-old thought she was signing up for."  The militant group has become adept at radicalizing people through digital propaganda like what the child found online. Ultimately, authorities only prevented her from joining the Islamic State's jihadist group because they pulled her off the plane before it took off. Green met the girl during Jigsaw's extensive research into ISIS's online recruiting narratives and how people get sucked into them.  Fast-forward more than a year, and Jigsaw has turned its research into a formula it hopes will dissuade potential recruits. The initiative takes advantage of Google's main skill: Advertising.  Debunking ISIS propaganda through ads  Green envisions targeting that 13-year-old during her early indoctrination phase, before she boarded her plane.  Jigsaw's so-called Redirect Method identifies keywords and patterns of online activity that reveal that a person may be on a path towards extremism. Then, it serves those people search, display, and video ads that push them to messages that subtly undermine ISIS propaganda. Crucially, the ads don't come across as overtly anti-ISIS. If a 13-year-old is searching for information about the Islamic State using complementary terms, the names of specific recruitment leaders, and insider slang, the key is presenting her with materials that she would want to engage with, but that ultimately marginalize ISIS ideas. That was one of Green's big take-aways from her conversations with the girl: People don't click on the kind of content that they don't want to see, so you have to draw them in delicately. Basically, you help get someone out of the ISIS echo chamber by at first making it unclear that they're leaving it.  Here's an example of one of the YouTube videos that someone could be redirected towards Screenshot / YouTube "It's essentially a targeted advertising campaign with curated content that debunks the mythology of ISIS," explains Green. In an 8-week, recently completed pilot program in both English and Arabic, Jigsaw supplied the ad targeting know-how and partnered with organizations Moonshot CVE and Beruit-based Quantum Communications for the content.  If a user clicked on one of the innocuous-looking ads they'd be ushered to a curated YouTube playlist of independently-created videos. Some examples include footage of an elderly woman confronting ISIS fighters, testimonials of ISIS defectors, and speeches by imams explaining the disconnect between Islam and ISIS. Only one step Although it's murky to try to measure the "effectiveness" of Jigsaw's trial campaign, Green says that 320,000 people clicked on its ads, and it saw a click-through-rate that was 70% higher than other ads against the same keywords (the typical click-through-rate of Google's ads generally is between 1.5 and 3%).  Notably, this isn't some charity act from Jigsaw or Google. These are real, paid for ads. Jigsaw's Green says the Redirect Method is powerful because it can scale. It can scale, because it's like any other ad campaign. All Jigsaw has to do is hand-off what it learned about keyword and search targeting and then organizations with funding can pour as much money into redirects as possible.  As a company, Google can't just block all ISIS materials from showing up in Google search results. Jigsaw's strategy gives it a low-risk way to help marginalize the group's messaging without running into free speech issues.  An undated photograph of a man described as Abdelhamid Abaaoud that was published in the Islamic State's online magazine Dabiq and posted on a social media website. REUTERS/Social Media Website via Reuters Charlie Winter, associate fellow at the international center for counter terrorism at The Hague tells Business Insider that he's cautiously optimistic about the program overall.  "I think Jigsaw and Moonshot both understand this issue very, very well, and I think that they'll be much better at deciding which counter-narrative will be most effective than most governments and NGOs, since they're using empirical evidence versus what's in the media," he says. But still: "I think we should be careful not to overestimate or exaggerate the value it will have."  He stresses that, ultimately, Arabic speakers who have been more thoroughly sucked into the ISIS worldview likely won't be watching videos on YouTube, since so much violent ISIS content has been scrubbed from the site for violating its terms-of-service. He doesn't see Jigsaw's ads changing the minds of hardcore recruits, though it could manage to reroute those in the earlier stages of radicalization. Jigsaw's Green acknowledges that this is only one step out of many. Ideally, she says, Jigsaw's content partners or a third party would follow-up with anyone who liked or commented on one of the curated videos through YouTube's messaging system to help with de-radicalization.     SEE ALSO: Larry Page's grand plan for Google looks more like a mess than a success NOW WATCH: A mysterious cloud moving 700,000 mph is going to collide with our galaxy — here's what will happen Loading video...

HERE WeGo, Waze, MapFactor, Mapquest, Scout GPS, MAPS.ME and InRoute are just some of the apps that are challenging Google Maps and Apple Maps, which dominate smartphone mapping services, by focusing on new and novel features. Mountain View-based Google and Cupertino-based Apple, though, aren’t content to stay in the slow lane of innovation. Both have added new features to their map apps in recent months, including enabling users to add interim destinations to go along with the ultimate stop on a trip. Google’s changes rolled out in an update to Google Maps this summer; Apple’s changes will be included in iOS 10, the soon-to-be released next version of its mobile operating system. “Just open the app, enter a destination, tap the corner menu, and then click add a stop,” Google says in a blog post. “To rearrange the order of your stops, tap and hold the three-dot menu to the left of Add Stop and drag it to the position you want.” The Apple Maps service has new features that seek to meld activities and services associated with a trip. “Apps like OpenTable can integrate bookings right into Maps,” Apple says on its website. “Services like Uber and Lyft can make it easier for users to book a ride, without ever leaving the Maps app.” And while this navigational arms race shifts into high gear, it’s become apparent the original stand-alone GPS devices are becoming stranded by the side of the road. The proliferation of smartphone apps has reshaped a market once dominated by the stand-alone machines, such as TomTom, Garmin and Magellan. According to market research firm Berg Insight, worldwide shipments of personal navigation devices has decreased from 40 million units in 2008 to a projected 11 million by the end of this year. That number is expected to drop to just 7 million in 2019 — less than a tenth of projected smartphone map app users in that year. “Most consumers are using their smartphones as their primary navigation and map system,” said Ben Bajarin, an analyst with Campbell-based Creative Strategies, a market researcher. “Retailers, in a lot of cases, don’t really promote the stand-alone devices any more.” The established map apps from Google and Apple offer a wide array of features, with the centerpiece being turn-by-turn navigation. And while the emerging apps also typically offer turn-based directions, they all attempt to offer niche features that also can go beyond the basics of the apps from the tech titans. Google-owned Waze, whose service is separate from Google Maps, emphasizes the social aspects of traveling, and its new features include improved ways to share your estimated time of arrival with others. It also provides quick access to frequent destinations. “You can use Waze to find out about lots of things,” Bajarin said. “It pops up icons to tell you about traffic, police in your area, gives you suggestions on alternate routes. It’s the integration of social media with navigation.” Other apps also seek to meld the drive with other services. Scout GPS emphasizes social interaction, including the ability to message friends and family and share your location or destination with designated people. HERE WeGo allows you to summon taxicabs or access a ride-hailing service. And some apps focus on improving the driving experience. Mapquest, one of the first computer-based navigation guides, recently began allowing drivers to see speed limits on the street they’re traveling. MAPS ME has added navigation elements that take up less space on the screen, and the speed the vehicle is traveling has been added. InRoute, designed mainly for long road trips, offers the ability to add numerous stops — and drivers can easily select routes that avoid areas with hot temperatures or hilly terrain. Saying it makes “cities easier to use,” Citymapper is geared to the daily commuter. In addition to vehicle navigation, the app has found a way to coordinate public transit and ride-hailing services so people can plan integrated trips. Citymapper’s service can be especially handy in big cities with major transit networks, said Michael Tchong, founder of Las Vegas-based Ubercool Innovation, which tracks technology trends. “The wave of the future is Citymapper,” Tchong said. “It integrates vehicle navigation, buses, subways, trains, Uber, Lyft all in one package. It will tell you whether the train you are on is running on time.” Experts predict the pace of innovation will pick up even more for map apps. “The map apps could become automated and start working as soon as you turn on your phone,” said Rob Enderle, an Oregon-based analyst who tracks the tech sector. “That way, if you’re driving, you don’t have to juggle a bunch of apps.” And map apps also may become more closely attuned to their users. They might start taking note of what types of restaurants you visit and only suggest those when you’re looking for a place to eat, Bajarin said. “The unique personalization of mapping is the next step,” he said. “We are on that cusp.” The big two The two big map apps for the major phone platforms are the widely used Google Maps for Android and iPhone and Apple Maps for the iPhone. GOOGLE MAPS What’s new: The ability to add interim stops to a destination, as well as estimates for how much time the detour will add to the trip. APPLE MAPS What’s new: Apple upgrades, include an interim stops feature; users who want a reminder of where they parked their car can use a pin drop as a target. The challengers Here are some free map apps that attempt to challenge, or at least seek to address some shortcomings of, the two primary programs from Google and Apple. WAZE What’s new: A cleaner and fresh look, with quick access to frequent destinations; a new way to share your ETA with others. MAPQUEST What’s new: Users can get speed limits to appear on their screens, including if you’re in a school zone. The route ahead is shown in what is called “2.5D” which Mapquest calls the “Perspective View.” Distance to a location now automatically updates. HERE WEGO What’s new: Now easier to pick a destination and scroll to the mode of transportation. The app also offers ride-booking company Car2Go, as well as info on taxi services. MAPFACTOR What’s new: Better alternative route calculation; improved Google searches; the icon highlights when searching for a point of interest. SCOUT GPS What’s new: Although turn-by-turn navigation is available, the app focuses on social interactions. Among the new features: You can send messages to friends and family; drive to the location of friends and family; share your location, route and real-time ETA; and ask a friend to pick you up. MAPS.ME What’s New. The navigation elements take up less space; speed is now displayed; and an autozoom element has been added; bicycle riders can see terrain data; search results show hotel ratings and prices. INROUTE What’s New: Custom routes that let people avoid the heat on a summer road trip, or for those towing a trailer, ways to avoid steep hills; users can also chose routes with a lot of curves. CITYMAPPER What’s New: Travelers can get alerts about disruptions on transit systems in a city.   Tags:  Apple,  Google,  Personal Technology,  Technology George Avalos George Avalos is a business reporter for the Bay Area News Group.

Google throws Pixel C users a bone with split screen, but still neglects tablet basics. by Ron Amadeo - Sep 11, 2016 2:00 pm UTC Login to bookmark 111 The Pixel C tablet has had a tough life. Under its code name of "Ryu," the Pixel C started life in the Chrome OS open source repository, seemingly indicating that at one point it was meant to run Chrome OS. Google was experimenting with a touchscreen interface for Chrome OS to the point that an on-screen keyboard (which is mostly useless on a laptop) shipped in the stable version. A finished version of an "all-touch" Chrome OS never materialized, though, and we ended up with a Pixel C running regular Android 6.0 Marshmallow. The result was a "productivity" device that couldn't multitask. You could type like a champ with the Pixel C's keyboard, but the one-app-at-a-time nature of Android made things like referencing information while typing pretty much impossible. The Pixel C was all the more disappointing because we knew a split screen mode was coming—a "highly experimental" version of the feature debuted in Marshmallow's developer preview. Split screen wasn't ready for the Pixel C's launch, though, which just fueled the feeling that the C was a half-baked device with software that wasn't ready for the hardware it was running on. There were other bad signs, too—the tablet had a whopping four microphones on top, which seemed to indicate it was built for some kind of killer voice recognition system, but it didn't even support always-on Google voice commands at launch. In a Reddit AMA hosted shortly after the launch of the Pixel C, the development team's response to questions was something along the lines of "just wait until Android N!" With the consumer version of Android N—Android 7.0 Nougat—finally out, let's take another look at the Pixel C. A full eight months after its release, can Nougat save the Pixel C? What's the status of Android tablets now that split screen has arrived? Is Android really ready for a device with a hardware keyboard? We're still not sure about hardware issues This is my third Pixel C. The first tablet had countless connection problems between the keyboard and tablet, and shortly after the review, we received a replacement unit that performed much better. After a few months of ownership, unit #2 started randomly rebooting after a security update. Some long threads in the official Google forums get into this, so mine wasn't an isolated case. Numerous OTAs arrived and even the N developer preview, but the random reboot problem never went away. It was later discovered that the only way to fix the random reboot problem is to have the hardware replaced. I ignored this and manually updated the Pixel C to the final version of Android 7.0 Nougat, and it promptly died, refusing to boot past the recovery screen. Time for replacement #3! So far, things have been fine. Do Android tablet apps still suck? (Spoiler alert: Yes) The Ars Technica Facebook page on the Pixel C. A shockingly-high number of apps does not support landscape mode in some or all of the interface, which is the primary orientation for the Pixel C. The Ars Technica Facebook page on the Pixel C. A shockingly-high number of apps does not support landscape mode in some or all of the interface, which is the primary orientation for the Pixel C. Google's flagship video chat app on the Pixel C—it's not compatible. Composing a tweet with the official twitter app. Instagram—no landscape support here either. If you want an example of a good app, Microsoft actually does an amazing job with all of its major apps. Excel is awesome on a tablet. The NFL's apps are pretty great, too. From Google, Gmail is still the gold standard. YouTube is great, too. The established wisdom is that the app situation on Android tablet is awful, but I hate repeating the established wisdom year after year without at least checking in on things once in a while. So let's investigate. In the year 2016, do Android tablet apps still suck? To answer this, I installed the top 200 apps on the Pixel C and gave them all a quick test drive. I looked at apps only—not games—using this "Top Apps only" Play Store list. The idea is that games scale just fine on tablets; it's apps that are the challenge. Of the top 200 apps: Nineteen were not compatible with the Pixel C Sixty-nine did not support landscape at all Eighty-four were stretched-out phone apps Twenty-eight were, by my judgment, actual "tablet" apps That there aren't many tablet apps isn't a surprise to most people. What was a shock was the lack of landscape support in so many apps. More than 33 percent of the top 200 were all portrait, all the time, and many more (even some Google apps) had interstitials and other single screens that didn't support landscape. Android apps are primarily used on phones, which are primarily used in portrait mode. The Pixel C primarily lives in landscape mode, though—the cameras, physical buttons, microphones, and speakers are oriented with the expectation of landscape, and the device must be in landscape in order to use the physical keyboard. When compared to the phone market, this is a very rare configuration that creates a problem in apps that most people won't notice. Most of the "phone" apps fall into three categories on a tablet: there's the dreaded stretched-out app, which makes no layout considerations for a tablet. Then there are the "Card" apps that hope to scale well on tablets by sticking everything into a card container, which then just gets slotted into a grid that fits your screen. There's also the "pillar box" app, which puts big margins on the left and right side of a phone app, relieving a bit of the "stretched out phone app" problems. But none of these apps are more powerful on a tablet the way a multi-pane, tablet-native app is. One of the best tablet app makers in the top 200 is Microsoft. Seeing why is easy. Google's design methodology is to view tablets as big phones, but Microsoft views them as tiny desktop computers. As a result, you get killer versions of Word, Excel, Outlook, and Skype, with information-dense, multi-pane layouts.

But of course, this being 2016, there’s no such thing as a “weekend break” in the leaksters’ world. Luckily for Google enthusiasts all around the world, the most anticipated phone on the planet — given that the Galaxy Note 7 and the new iPhone have been announced officially — is nearing its rumored launch date with some juicy leaks serving as a tasty appetizer… Thanks to a collaboration between Steve Hemmerstoffer (better known in the tech world for its Twitter handle, “@OnLeaks”) and Android Authority, we now have a “confirmation” look at the outer shell of “Sailfish”, the currently-in-the-works upcoming flagship from Google. Sailfish is the codename Mountain View has given to the smaller, 5″ handset, but its sibling (Marlin) is allegedly identical in terms of look, so while we don’t know exactly how big it will be (save for its larger, 5.5″, QHD panel), this is pretty much what it will look like in terms of aesthetics. The display size is here rumored to be somewhere around 5.2 or 5.3 inches, but it’d be weird to have a “bigger phone” with just a 0.2 or 0.3″ difference — we’ll see with that. Now, if the images above look familiar, that’s because we have already seen actual pics of what seemed to be this same device, which now gain validation judging from the 3D models here recreated thanks to Hemmerstoffer’s hunting. Given that his track record on this type of CAD models-based leaks is usually on point, we are confident enough that the recreations above are indeed legit. So what exactly are we dealing with? Well, for one, I believe we can shoo the fear of an HTC One A9 copycat (a phone not exactly known for its design’s originality in the first place). While HTC is at this point almost certainly the OEM in charge of the device’s construction, there’s very little resemblance between the two handsets — no more than that between Sailfish an almost any other smartphone on Earth. The back of the phone is again said to be metallic, while the extra layer that surrounds the camera and the fingerprint reader (Pixel Imprint?) should be made out of glass, which gives the phone a distinct look I personally like. What’s missing — and almost certain to be on the final product — is a Google logo, which could come in the form of the firm’s stylized “G” at the bottom, right above the antenna line (either that or the full “Google” sign, but no “Nexus” this time around). What’s making a — rather subdued, unfortunately — comeback is a pair of stereo speakers. The first render of the Pixel phone made it look like HTC and Google had ditched the Nexus 6P‘s strong set of front-firing speakers, but the report mentions that the two holes at the bottom surrounding the USB-C port are indeed part of a stereo setup — and considering that the HTC 10 has a fancy stereo layout, even were one of the two grills to be actually used as a microphone, we are likely to still get better-than-average audio. Dimensions come in at 143.8 x 69.5 x 7.3 mm at the phone’s thinnest point (the bottom) while the Pixel measures 8.5 mm at the top — somewhere in between the Nexus 5 and the Nexus 5X, for reference. Oh, and other than the “reconfirmed” 2770mAh battery, 4GB of RAM and Snapdragon 820 (or 821) SoC, there is a headphone jack right on the top left corner. While I still wish for the signature Pixel light bar to make an appearance, I have to say that I like the design a lot and that when the finalized product will shine in all of its official renders beauty, I will probably geek out a bit — October 4 can’t come soon enough. But what do you think?

Navigation gHacks Technology News The independent technology news blog Home Header Menu Home Windows Software Firefox Chrome Google Android Email Deals Best of Support Us Return to Content Firefox Task Manager extension By Martin Brinkmann on September 11, 2016 in Firefox - Last Update:September 12, 2016 13 Task Manager is a brand new browser add-on for the Firefox web browser that adds task manager like capabilities to the Firefox browser. One of the cooler things of Google Chrome is the Task Manager that Google ships with the browser natively. Chrome's Task Manager displays all open websites in tabs, internal processes, and extensions, and lists their memory, cpu and network use. You may use it to end any process right from there, which can be mighty helpful if a website or extension is misbehaving in one way or another. To open the Task Manager in Chrome, simply use the keyboard shortcut Shift-Esc, or click on Menu > More Tools > Task Manager instead. Firefox Task Manager The new Firefox add-on Task Manager works similarly. You need to install it first in Firefox though as it is a third-party add-on and not natively integrated in the browser. The extension adds an icon to the main Firefox toolbar that you may click on to display the tasks in the browser. Note: The author states that the extension works best if you have multi-process Firefox enabled. This test was done on a machine running Firefox with e10s and eight content processes enabled. The Task Manager interface for Firefox opens in a new window when you click on it. The information it displays list the type of task (e.g. web page or add-on), a description which usually is a name or title, memory use, process ID and information, cpu and system utilization and P.Memory. You may notice that memory is not listed for some tasks (usually not for add-ons or system). A click on a task displays additional information about it in the lower pane. This includes its full url, if available, and various memory related information. The extension refreshes the listing every 2 seconds by default which you can increase up to 10 seconds or decrease to 1 second. It would be handy if there was an option to pause the refreshing. Just like Chrome's Task Manager, Task Manager for Firefox allows you to kill processes. All you need to do is select one or multiple processes -- there are checkboxes for that in the front of each line -- and click on the kill process button afterwards. Please note that the ending of processes is limited to web pages currently. The "kill process" button remains inactive if you select system or add-on tasks in the listing. A killed website is terminated immediately. This means that its tab is closed, and if it was the last tab of a window, that window enters Valhalla with it. Closing Words Mozilla incidentally is working on a feature to display the memory use of individual content processes as well in Firefox. Task Manager offers an advanced interface however and options to kill processes, something that Mozilla's current implementation does not support. All in all, another shining example of how powerful Firefox's add-on engine is currently. Now You: Do you monitor memory use of your browsers?

Multi-process is not active on my Firefox 48.0.2 64-BIT with 70 add-ons on / Windows 7SP1 64-BIT (info for what it's worth). The Firefox Task Manager extension here displays : - Memory only for webpages - Processes : same value for all, that of parent (logical since not multi-process) - CPU%, System%, Impact for all groups In fact, without Electrolysis activated Memory and Processes data lack. I'll move to Electrolysis sooner or later, perhaps rather later if not when no choice simply because of 30+ add-ons among the 70 which are not at this time e10 compatible. Reply Anonymous September 11, 2016 at 5:09 pm # >70 add-ons WTF, man? Reply Tom Hawack September 11, 2016 at 11:40 pm # My harem, even if I have a trio of favorites :) Tonyt September 11, 2016 at 9:58 pm # Tom, just curious, with 70 add-ons, do you find Firefox quite slow compared to Firefox without any add-ons? You can try Firefox without any add-ons for a moment by creating a new temporary Firefox profile. Reply Tom Hawack September 11, 2016 at 11:39 pm # The only issue I notice is the startup length, and it's more related to maybe 6 specific add-ons than to the fact they are 70 all together. Surfing speed is not impacted, the overall velocity, page rendering, as the sum ProtectionExtraDelay - SkippedGainedDelay remains IMO < default settings, perhaps even < 0 (I gain more with the adequate add-ons allowing to skip connections (among which ads+tracking) then I lose time by using these add-ons). This equation includes 4-5 add-ons. The remaining add-ons are neutral when surfing. It's not the number of add-ons that counts, it's what each brings and takes specifically. Dresandreal Sprinklehorn September 11, 2016 at 6:06 pm # Working great in Firefox 48.0.2 64 bit with e10s activated in Windows 8.1. Reply Liv September 11, 2016 at 6:24 pm # Multi-process is also disabled in my Firefox 49.0b12 b4-bit on Arch Linux 64-Bit. Reply Yuliya September 11, 2016 at 7:22 pm # People use it? I consider myself fairly tech literate, but really only opened the task manager in Chromium so see how it looks like and then closed it. I assume it could be useful if one tab hangs, use it to kill that particular tab, but usually for me if one tab hangs the whole browser becomes unresponsive, or crashes. For what it is, it's good nonetheless, like monitoring RAM usage of extensions.. Reply Atavic September 11, 2016 at 11:40 pm # Point is: If you have a multi-process browser... only one single tab hangs, while the GUI doesn't, so you can open up this extension and kill the hanged tab (aka the single process). Reply Dan82 September 12, 2016 at 1:20 pm # The question I posit to you in reply: why should you even need an extension for that? If you're were to use a multi-process browser, the interface would not be affected by a frozen tab, so you should always be able to close the tab directly and achieve the same result. Any browser that doesn't even offer this basic functionality is something to be avoided. I haven't tried the Firefox e10s builds though, so I can't comment on the quality of its multi-process design and user-friendliness. Reply Martin Brinkmann September 12, 2016 at 2:05 pm # I think the Task Manager in its current form is more about listing how much RAM each site uses. It would be more useful if you could kill plugins/add-ons as well, but that is not possible currently. Firefox's interface is not super responsive if a site crashed, and that is only if the crash does not take the whole browser with it. This should not happen anymore with e10s but things can still lag or be really slow especially with only one content process currently. I did not run in crashes yet after enabling e10s, but will monitor the situation closely and report back on e10s effectiveness, or lack thereof, in this regard. Xircal September 12, 2016 at 6:43 pm # Martin, The link in the Closing Words paragraph loads a blank page (?) Reply Martin Brinkmann September 12, 2016 at 6:57 pm # Sorry for that, corrected.

Her new corporate wellness service, Thrive, aims to teach companies to "treat the whole human."   Rebecca Greenfield Bloomberg     Weeks after leaving her eponymous news website to launch a corporate wellness service called Thrive, Arianna Huffington has hired former New York Times and Google executives for the new venture, aiming to teach companies to "treat the whole human." As it enters the crowded workplace wellness industry, with its quit-smoking incentives and step challenges, Thrive intends to go beyond the usual offerings to focus on "the mental aspects of our lives, what's happening in our heads," Huffington said in an interview. "This is all something that you bring to work," she added. Huffington spent more than a decade running the Huffington Post, which she founded in 2005, but over the years her interest shifted from news to the pursuit of elusive work-life balance. In the last two years, she has published two books -- "Thrive: The Third Metric to Redefining Success and Creating a Life of Well-Being, Wisdom, and Wonder" and the nap-at-work manifesto "The Sleep Revolution" -- full of theories she's now spinning into her new business. Last month, she announced she was leaving her namesake site to pursue her latest venture. Thrive will officially launch Nov. 30, Huffington said. In the meantime, the company is staffing up: Rajiv Pant, a former chief technology officer at The New York Times, has come on as CTO, and Kathryn Friedrich, who spent the better part of a decade at Google and YouTube, will join next month as chief marketing officer. Both said Huffington's plea for a more humane work-life balance drew them to the organization. "I was truly stressed out. This is something I personally connected with," said Pant. "If you look at my tweets, they're about behavior, getting enough sleep. This is the right company." Friedrich thinks Thrive can create a more positive work-life experience than even Google, considered an Eden of workplace culture. "Google tries to create a good existence for their employees. They do a fantastic job," she said. "The one thing that might be missing that Arianna wants to bring to the table are metrics. It's one thing to put all the offerings out there. It's another thing to measure the success of those things." (Google is known for studying its company culture's effects on employees' productivity and happiness.) At its core, Thrive is a corporate wellness consultancy: Companies pay Thrive-trained coaches to bestow health and wellness tips on their overworked and underperforming staffs. They can opt for online courses or in-person trainings, with sessions ranging from a couple of hours to six weeks. Huffington said that the consulting firm Accenture has already piloted trainings and that JPMorgan Chase has also signed on for a partnership. In addition to its courses, Thrive will also have a media arm, as Bloomberg reported in June. Huffington has previously said Thrive is not a media company but said in an interview that it will have "a consumer platform attached to the corporate platform that will be constantly reinforcing our message." Much like the Huffington Post, the site will rely on big names, like athletes and experts, for its content. It will also sell wellness-related products like pillows and food supplements, and Huffington hopes it will eventually become a discussion platform open to the public -- something the company is working on with Medium, she said. The sell? All of this, in theory, services Thrive's clients' bottom lines. But with its entry into the corporate wellness industry, which market research firm IBISWorld values at $6 billion, Thrive is competing within an already crowded space. And Huffington -- who champions digital detoxing, office napping and actually unplugging on vacation -- is not alone in pushing mindfulness on companies. Many other wellness companies address both body and mind, too, offering office fitness alongside meditation. Corporate wellness budgets have ballooned as companies try to curb health insurance costs, since a healthier workforce means lower insurance costs and higher productivity. But a much-cited RAND Corporation study has called many such wellness offerings into question, finding that for all the money poured into them, they save little on health care: For every $1 spent on "lifestyle management" programs -- like smoking cessation and weight-loss initiatives -- companies saved just 50 cents, the study found. Huffington is confident Thrive's holistic approach will yield better results for both clients and workers, saying the Rand study "really didn't address things like stress and burnout." Thrive, she said, will rely only on "evidence-based" methods for its courses; it has hired Adam Grant, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, to study its work with Accenture. "As we get more evidence, we will be adopting and adjusting everything we are doing," said Huffington. Maybe napping at the office only works during certain times of day? Or maybe meetings are actually better when everyone has a cellphone? For now, in its own SoHo offices, Thrive plans to practice what it preaches. Meetings will be device-free. ("We have beautiful notebooks," said Huffington.) And, yes, there will be a place to nap.

Wood This is an article based on ARK Brainstorming, a weekly discussion between our CEO, Director of Research, thematic analysts, ARK’s theme developers, thought leaders and investors. It is designed to keep you engaged in an ongoing discussion on investing in disruptive innovation. 1. Google vs. Uber This week David Drummond from Google stepped down from Uber’s board in response to an increasing number of conflicts of interest. Shortly after this announcement, Google unveiled a carpooling service hosted by traffic and navigation app, Waze, in San Francisco. Owned by Google, Waze already has gone live with a carpooling service in Israel, where it takes a 15% cut. It will not take a cut in San Francisco for now, instead charging Bay area commuters and paying drivers 54 cents per mile, undercutting Uber and Lyft. Next up, autonomous taxis! ARK estimates that Google could charge just 35 cents per mile for autonomous travel and still turn a profit. At that price, taking an autonomous taxi would cheaper than walking. 2. The Brave Browser Brave Software, which provides a controversial web browser that automatically blocks ads and trackers, launched Brave Payments this week. Brave Payments allows users to allocate a monthly amount for ad-free Internet access, deploying an algorithm to dispense those funds to sites based on the user’s viewing activity. A monthly payment solves the obstacles created by micropayment models which require the reader to pay page-by-page. While Brave Payments compensates content creators directly and protects user privacy, Brave Software boasts faster performance by blocking ads which typically take up to 60% of the time necessary to load a page. While advertisers and ad-blockers are waging digital warfare, we think Brave seems to have stepped outside the box, blocking them all.

The Great Purge at Alphabet During the past few months, Alphabet has been shuffling management and killing projects at a rate unseen since the company’s founding. Some notable examples: This week, Google killed off Project Ara, a much hyped project to build modular phones. Chris Urmson and several senior members of Google’s self driving car project have left. Bill Maris, head of Google Ventures, Alphabet’s VC division, has left. Tony Fadell, the CEO of Google’s Nest division has left and its software engineers have been absorbed into Google. Google Fiber is under renewed pressure to cut costs. Boston Dynamics, Google’s famed robotics company, is reportedly up for sale. What could be causing this upheaval? Last year, the company reorganized itself into a holding company under the Alphabet name to improve the transparency and accountability of its subsidiaries. As the one-year anniversary of this reorganization approaches, the first house cleaning after holding senior executives accountable may be in force. More than a coincidence,CFO Ruth Porat joined Alphabet not long ago with a mandate to add fiscal discipline to the organization and enhance shareholder value.

By: Tech Desk | Published:September 11, 2016 1:28 pm Google has rolled out an update for its Photos app that will allow iOS users to convert Live Photos in to GIFs and video clips. Google has rolled out an update for its Photos app that will allow iOS users to convert Live Photos into GIFs and video clips. The version 2.0 of Google Photos lets users share GIFs with friends and family. “Now, with the latest Google Photos update on iOS, you can make your Live Photos smoother and more shareable in just a tap,” the company wrote in a post on Google +. According to Google, the technology uses advanced stabilization and rendering originally used in the Motion Stills app. Motion Stills app for iOS was unveiled by Google in June. Google’s Motion Stills app lets users convert Live Photos in to GIFs, and share them on social media too. Motion Stills uses its own video stabilisation technology to freeze the background that makes GIFs even more smooth. “Google Photos can freeze the background in your Live Photos or create sweeping cinematic pans, turning your Live Photos into beautiful, captivating moments,” Google’s post added. Google’s Live Photos update is completely offline and can be used even without Internet. Google Photos freezes the background in Live Photos or create sweeping cinematic pans, to turn them in to GIFs. These can be saved as a looping video and can be shared on YouTube as well. “You can simply browse through your Live Photos stream, or flip through one-by-one and watch them auto-play,” says Google. According to an IANS report, a Live Photo captures 1.5 seconds of video and audio both before and after you press the shutter button to take a photo. “Thus, in addition to a still JPEG image, you also get a three second Live Photo,” the report adds.

Google Pixel (Nexus Sailfish) Leaks in 360-Degree Video and Press Renders GO The phone comes with a metal and glass build Sep 11, 2016 07:18 GMT  ·  By Alexandra Vaidos  ·  Share:  Google is expected to release two smartphones on October 4, and the names of the upcoming devices are still uncertain, with recent leaks pointing towards Pixel and Pixel XL branding. The smaller model, Pixel or Nexus Sailfish, has just leaked in a 360-degree video and press renders. The images and video have been leaked by Android Authority and @OnLeaks, and they show the smartphone from all angles, including its design and ports that it might come with. Aside from this, some rumored specs of the upcoming device have been confirmed. Google’s Pixel (Nexus Sailfish) seems to come with a USB Type-C port, which is to be expected, seeing how the microUSB has been missing from many flagships launched in the past period of time. The images suggest the phone could be coming with dual stereo speakers, placed on the bottom of the handset, right next to the USB Type-C port. The smartphone’s measurements have been revealed as well. It thus seems to measure 143.8 x 69.5 x 7.3 mm at the thinnest point at the bottom and 8.5 mm at the top, which is the thickest point. The report mentions that the headphone port is located on the top left side of the device. Battery capacity on the Pixel could reach just 2,770mAh Google Pixel could come with a full HD display measuring about 5.2 - 5.3 inches and run Snapdragon 820 SoC, although there’s a slight chance that it could come with the latest processor model from Qualcomm, the Snapdragon 821. In addition, it seems to feature 4GB of RAM, which has become the norm for the latest flagships. 32GB of internal storage and a 12MP rear camera are other specs expected on the upcoming phone, together with an 8MP front camera and a fingerprint scanner on the back. Battery capacity should reach 2,770mAh while the Pixel XL (Nexus Marlin) could have a bigger battery. One thing that makes these phones exciting is the fact that they will come with stock Android Nougat, possibly the 7.1 Nougat version, which is projected to incorporate the Nexus Launcher and Google Assistant. Google will host an event on October 4, during which the company is expected to unveil the Pixel (Nexus Sailfish) and Pixel XL (Nexus Marlin).   CHECK OUT THE GALLERY  (4 Images) #Google#Google Pixel#Pixel XL#Android 7.1 Nougat#Google Assistant subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Google Pixel leaks in video and press renders (4 Images) 01 02 03 04 Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Android 7.0 Nougat OTA for Nexus 6P Starts Rolling Out Specs for Google and Huawei's Rumored Nexus 7P Tablet Leaked Pre-Orders for Google Pixel and Pixel XL Phones to Start on October 4 Google Might Finally Release a Successor to Nexus 7 Some U.S. Android Phones Have Secret Backdoor That Sends Data to China - Update OnePlus 3T vs OnePlus 3: Is It Worth the Upgrade?

Restaurants Home Nation / World How Pittsburgh became Uber’s testing ground print Share | e-mail Facebook Tweet StumbleUpon Google 2784900 false Jeff Swensen / The New York Times An Uber car drives through Pittsburgh last week to map out the roads and topography before the introduction of the company’s driverless vehicles. Click here to enlarge image Cutting edge How Pittsburgh became Uber’s testing ground By Cecilia Kang / New York Times News Service Published Sep 11, 2016 at 12:02AM PITTSBURGH — Any day now, Uber will introduce a fleet of self-driving cars in Pittsburgh, making this former steel town the world’s first city to let passengers hail autonomous vehicles. So with the world watching, what has the city of 306,000 done to prepare for Uber’s unprecedented test? The answer is not much. There have been no public service announcements or demonstrations of the technology. Except for the mayor and one police official, no other top city leader has seen a self-driving Uber vehicle operate up close. Fire and emergency services don’t know where the Uber cars will travel. It is precisely this hands-off approach that has made Pittsburgh ideal grounds for one of Silicon Valley’s boldest experiments — and it has ignited criticism that the city is giving away its keys to Uber, which is testing a nascent technology and has a reputation for running roughshod over regulators and municipalities. “It’s not our role to throw up regulations or limit companies like Uber,” said Bill Peduto, Pittsburgh’s mayor, who said that Uber planned to use about 100 modified Volvo sport utility vehicles for the passenger trials. The vehicles will also have a human monitor behind the wheel. “You can either put up red tape or roll out the red carpet. If you want to be a 21st-century laboratory for technology, you put out the carpet.” The mayor’s mantra highlights what it takes these days as cities seek to shed their Rust Belt pasts and transform themselves into technology hubs — essentially, give the tech companies lots of free rein. The approach, described as greenlight governing, is one that Pittsburgh and the state of Pennsylvania have nurtured over the last few years. When Uber wanted to expand its research around autonomous vehicles, Pittsburgh helped the company lease a large plot near the city’s riverfront for a testing track. When state regulators tried to ban ride-hailing services in 2014, Pittsburgh’s mayor and the state’s governor helped bat those hurdles down. Otherwise, Pittsburgh’s politicians stay out of the way. The approach has many benefits, allowing Pittsburgh and Pennsylvania to position themselves at the forefront of a driverless-vehicle movement that has swept up tech companies including automakers, Google and Baidu of China. It has brought tech entrepreneurs to Pittsburgh and attracted hundreds of scientists and engineers to new research centers opened in the city in the last decade by Apple, Google, Intel and Uber. But it also has invited criticism from those who say Pittsburgh is giving too much power to tech companies, all for a sheen of innovation. Some residents are on edge about Uber’s self-driving vehicles and complain that they have been thrust into an experiment with potential safety risks. “I feel like we were pushed into being part of this by the city,” said Montana Michniak, a recent college graduate who works at a cafe in the city’s South Side neighborhood. How Pittsburgh handles the unveiling of Uber’s self-driving fleet is being closely watched by other tech and auto companies that are doing their own driverless experiments in places like California and Michigan (although Apple is said to have laid off dozens of employees in its self-driving car project and to be rethinking its strategy). Depressed cities around the nation are watching to see if the Pittsburgh story can be a blueprint for their own transitions into tech hubs. “This is the first mayor in Pittsburgh to really get it, and that’s a big reason why the city has become the best case of Rust Belt revival,” said Richard Florida, a professor of urban studies at the University of Toronto, who previously taught at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. He said he was “frankly surprised at how long a leash” Uber got. Peduto said Uber did not have too much power in Pittsburgh and that the city would be safe because there would be a human monitor in the Uber test cars. The mayor also has his eye on a bigger safety goal. “There is no technology that is fail-proof, and there is no tech that can guarantee there won’t be accidents, but right now there are 3,287 people who die in automobile-related accidents around the world each day, and there has to be a better way,” he said. In a statement, Uber said of Pittsburgh, “Our work would not be possible without the support we’ve received from city leaders.” Uber came to Pittsburgh in early 2015, drawn by the engineering talent at Carnegie Mellon. The university started a robotics department 30 years ago, when driverless cars seemed like a fantasy, but robotics has since proved crucial for the systems that let vehicles navigate streets on their own. By this decade, the university’s expertise in computer science had attracted not only Uber but also General Motors, Google and Intel, some of which embedded at Carnegie Mellon. Google and Uber later opened research centers, hiring dozens of Carnegie Mellon professors and graduate students. Today, Uber has 500 employees at a center in Pittsburgh’s industrial Strip District working on autonomous vehicles, according to Peduto. Uber will have 1,000 employees at the site, known as the Advanced Technology Center, within a few years and plans to increase investments to $1 billion from hundreds of millions of dollars in a decade, he said. For driverless car tests, Pennsylvania also held a legal advantage. Specifically, the state’s transportation rules did not explicitly ban driverless cars, as long as someone was behind the wheel to take over if needed. Officials from Pennsylvania’s transportation agency said they interpreted that silence on driverless technology as a green light. Some state officials said they also believed that driverless cars could be safer than those steered by drivers, helping avoid driver-related deaths. “We’d be committing governmental malpractice if we didn’t pursue this technology,” said Roger Cohen, the policy director of the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation. In Pittsburgh, Peduto fostered a close relationship with Uber. In Peduto’s first meeting in early 2015 with Uber’s chief executive, Travis Kalanick, Kalanick said he had noticed efforts by Peduto and other officials to fight the state public utilities commission’s proposed ban on ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft in 2014. Kalanick also laid out a plan for Uber’s driverless cars. “Travis’ vision was to build out the autonomous vehicles industry in 10 years,” Peduto said. “We shared a vision to do it in a way that would be a benefit for society.” Weeks later, in a meeting with President Barack Obama at a conference for the National League of Cities, Peduto urged Obama to support autonomous vehicles and declared Pittsburgh’s intention to be a testing ground. Since then, Pittsburgh has showed its friendliness to Uber’s efforts. Last year, it also worked with the city’s police department on plans to install a ride-hailing kiosk in the lively South Side district, for the use of people who had been drinking and would prefer not to drive home. Pittsburgh International Airport last year also designated waiting areas for Uber and Lyft passengers. Yet Uber has mostly gone ahead with its self-driving-car plans in Pittsburgh alone. Driverless cars with Uber’s logo have cruised around town for months, in part to get the public used to seeing them. With cameras and GPS units mounted on the roofs, the vehicles collect mapping data on plants and trees, the conditions of sidewalks, and traffic markings for nearly every street. “There’s really not been a whole lot of collaboration on the actual testing,” said Scott Schuster, Pittsburgh’s assistant chief of police, who rode in one of the Uber vehicles last June and signed a nondisclosure agreement to do so. 15014590 View next article in Nation & World     Get Central Oregon's top headlines delivered to your inbox every morning GO print version Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus This image is copyrighted.

File picture: Eric Risberg San Francisco - There's a quirky twist on tourism emerging amid the Silicon Valley whirlwind of innovation that has tethered everyone to their smartphones. Those omnipresent devices are being used to track down technological touchstones scattered around the San Francisco Bay area so selfies can be taken, videos can be recorded and the experience can be celebrated in a Facebook post, Snapchat or tweet. Here's a tourist's guide to nerd nirvana for those more interested in seeing the suburban home where The Woz built the first Apple computer alongside Steve Jobs than the spooky prison in the Bay where the Birdman of Alcatraz once served time alongside Machine Gun Kelly. Growing up in a garage Silicon Valley startups have a history of humble beginnings, dating to 1939 when Hewlett-Packard was founded in a Palo Alto, California, garage. It still stands at 367 Addison Ave., considered by many to be the birthplace of Silicon Valley. HP now owns the place. Jobs was one of many entrepreneurs influenced by the HP legacy as a teenager, eventually inspiring him and his engineering friend, Steve “The Woz” Wozniak, to begin working on Apple's first computer in the home of Jobs' parents. That ranch-style house at 2066 Crist Drive in Los Altos, California, is now owned by Jobs' sister, Patricia. After they started Google in 1998, co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin built what would become the world's dominant search engine in a garage and room they rented from Susan Wojcicki, whom they later hired (she now runs YouTube for them). The Menlo Park, California, house, at 232 Santa Margarita Ave., is now owned by Google. Shortly after starting Facebook in his Harvard dorm room in 2004, Mark Zuckerberg and a few friends moved to Silicon Valley for what they thought would be just one summer. Zuckerberg never returned to Harvard, and the world hasn't been quite the same since then. The Palo Alto, California house where Zuckerberg did a lot of computer coding and threw some wild parties, if you believe the movies, is located at 819 La Jennifer Way. The place is still rented out by young entrepreneurs hoping some of Zuckerberg's magic will rub off on them. Tech temples The headquarters of Apple, Google and Facebook have turned into must-see shrines to products that have become part of culture's lifeblood. None of the companies offers public tours, but that doesn't mean you can't steal glimpses at these factories of innovation. Search starts here Google is the most accessible of the three headquarters. The hub of its Mountain View, California, campus is at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, with other Google offices sprawling almost all the way down to the nearby NASA Ames Research Center, where Page and Brin keep personal jets in a hangar. Walk down Charleston Road and you are bound to see one of the company's employees (also known as “Googlers”) cruising on yellow, green, blue and red bikes placed outside all the offices to get to meetings more quickly. While strolling around, make sure to swing into the office at 1981 Landings Drive, where you can take a selfie with Android statues memorialising different versions of the operating system that powers most of the world's smartphones. Each statue represents a dessert because Google has nicknamed each version after something sweet. The menu includes Cupcake, Donut, Eclair, Froyo, Gingerbread, Honeycomb, Ice Cream Sandwich, Jelly Bean, KitKat, Lollipop and Marshmallow. The latest serving of Android, called Nougat, has just started rolling out. Finally, in the Google store on the main campus, you can buy company-branded merchandise, including shirts, hats, mugs, pens and even notebooks (the kind with paper). A place everyone likes The giant thumbs-up sign replicating Facebook's symbol for liking a post has become one of the most photographed spots in Silicon Valley since the social networking company moved its headquarters from Palo Alto to 1 Hacker Way in nearby Menlo Park five years ago. Unless you happen to be in a plane or have a camera-equipped drone, you won't be able to see what's on top of another Facebook building across the street (an underground tunnel connects the offices). That building, designed by famed architect Frank Gehry, features a nine-acre park atop the roof. One more thing Apple, founded in 1976, has had a fiercely loyal following for decades, so its Cupertino, California, headquarters has long drawn tourists looking to get a picture of its famous logo and the 1 Infinite Loop sign denoting its address. There is, of course, an Apple store at the headquarters, where people can buy company-branded merchandise not sold in most of its other stores. But you can't get help fixing your iPhone, iPad or Mac here. You'll have to go to another store for an appointment at the Genius Bar that serves as Apple's customer-help desk. The current headquarters will be overshadowed next year when Apple plans to open a nearby 2.8 million-square-foot, circular office that has been likened to a huge spaceship sitting on a 176-acre site. Known as “Campus 2”, the new building is designed to accommodate about 12 000 workers. Before Jobs died in 2011, he stipulated that the campus should be surrounded by about 7 000 trees. TV show The HBO comedy Silicon Valley has won many accolades over three seasons, so fans may want to see the house that serves as headquarters for the fictional startup, Pied Piper. The location has been given as 5230 Newell Road in Palo Alto on the series, but that address doesn't exist. The house is actually is in southern California, at 5230 Penfield Avenue in Woodland Hills. So put it on the sightseeing list for your next visit to Hollywood. ANA-AP Connect with us on LinkedIn Hungry for more business news? Sign up for our daily newsletter!

Everybody loves a group hug. Next to the freeze-frame of Angela Lansbury grinning after she’s solved another “Murder, She Wrote” case, it’s pretty much the most satisfying ending anyone can hope for. “Lion” ends in a group hug — two, if you count the real-life embrace that follows the reenacted one just before the credits — and that’s fantastic news for the cash-strapped Weinstein Co., which needs a feel-good crowd-pleaser like nobody’s business. After “Lion” makes its millions, someone else can make a movie about how Google Earth saved the struggling indie distributor. And it can end with a shot of Harvey Weinstein, Saroo Brierley (the “Lion” himself), and director Garth Davis giving one another a big group hug at the Oscars. But let’s get serious: The story of how 5-year-old Saroo was tragically separated from his family, wound up adopted by an Aussie couple on a completely different continent, and managed to find his birth mother 25 years later using Google Earth might be a happy one, but it’s barely meaty enough to wrap the evening news, let alone sustain a two-hour feature. While unique, Saroo’s story is somewhere between the-guy-who-found-a-lottery-scratcher-worth-fifty-bucks and the-farmer-who-prayed-for-rain-and-got-it. Such feel-good yarns are only as interesting as the person they happened to. Fortunately for Davis, he’s got a terrific cast, chief among them the pair of charismatic actors who split the lead role: First, newcomer Sunny Pawar wins us over as 5-year-old Saroo, who’s so adorable he could set off an Indian adoption craze (which would suit the humanitarian-minded filmmakers just fine), then “Slumdog Millionaire” star Dev Patel steps in to play the less interesting chapter, as the young man turns to the internet to research where he’s from. But the movie surrounds these two with Nicole Kidman as Saroo’s adoptive mother, Rooney Mara as his Indian food-loving girlfriend, and Priyanka Bose as the mum he left behind (her smile so lovely she could pass for Rosario Dawson’s South Asian sister). Meanwhile, Google Earth plays itself. Davis, a commercials director whose reel includes Toyota’s “Ninja Kittens” spot, would be a natural to boil Saroo’s story down to a tear-jerking 60 seconds (even if this material sounds like an extended promo for the one company that needs it least). In 2013, Davis collaborated with Jane Campion on the miniseries “Top of the Lake,” which suggests that he could probably also stretch Saroo’s narrative across four more hours. “Lion” marks his much-anticipated feature debut, previously pegged to be an adaptation of Gregory David Roberts’ 900-page “Shantaram,” and it’s practically the opposite of that project in every way: “Shantaram” tells of an Australian criminal at large in India, whereas “Lion” describes an Indian kid who discovers his identity Down Under. With only the leanest wisp of a plot to guide him, screenwriter Luke Davies expands Saroo’s ordeal into a full-blown hero’s journey — like “Life of Pi,” with a flesh-and-blood “lion” in place of a CG tiger. Tagging along with his brother Guddu (Abhishek Bharate) one night, Saroo falls asleep on a decommissioned train, which travels some 1,600 miles before letting him disembark in Calcutta. There, everyone speaks Bengali, rather than Saroo’s Hindi dialect, making it doubly intimidating for a boy so far-removed from his family. Davis ensures that we understand even less of Saroo’s surroundings than he does, which makes his first impressions of Calcutta — sleeping on cardboard, only to be awakened by a child-snatching mob, or else invited home by a sari-clad woman, who tries to pawn him off to a lecherous middleman — seem as dark and intimidating as Pinocchio’s visit to Pleasure Island. As if there was ever any doubt, Davis clearly wants his audience to appreciate how tough it is to be homeless in India, presenting us with a funeral procession and images of scavenging through garbage dumps for anything to eat. When a benevolent stranger brings Saroo to the local police station, the boy asks for his mother, but doesn’t know enough — not her name, nor that of the village from which he came — to find his way home, and so he is delivered to an orphanage, and shortly thereafter, shipped out to Tasmania, where he’s adopted by John and Sue Brierley (played by David Wenham, who’d worked with Davis on “Top of the Lake,” and Kidman, looking just about as unglamorous as she can). Considering everything he’s been through, Saroo is an ideal child — a judgment made clear by the arrival of a second Indian boy, the deeply unhappy Mantosh, into the household. At this point, nearly an hour into the narrative, the film skips forward 20 years, picking up with Saroo’s relocation to Melbourne, where he plans to study hotel management, but instead finds himself distracted with “dead ends” about his identity. He gets emotional support from girlfriend Lucy (Mara), who at one point looks as though she may break out into a Bollywood dance number, but when it comes to answering seemingly impossible questions, that’s what Google is for. And so, like any good stalker, Saroo pins clues to a giant bulletin board and begins crawling the web for clues to his past. Except, anyone going in to “Lion” already knows how Saroo’s predicament turns out, which makes this agonizingly suspense-free process feel as if it’s taking far longer than it should. It would almost be more interesting to tell his story from the point of view of the Google Earth engineers — say, one who had turned suicidal after months of coding for the Silicon Valley monolith, only to discover what good he was doing in the world — or else from the perspective of Saroo’s birth mother, who didn’t have Google (or even a computer) but spent years searching for her lost son. Davies’ script is noteworthy in its sensitivity, which Davis further enhances through his elegant, deeply empathetic approach (heightened by gorgeous widescreen cinematography, much of it offering hi-res flyover shots clearly designed to evoke the heroic tool), but as a portrait of persistence, it paradoxically suggests that Saroo managed to go two decades without thinking much about his mother, only to become obsessed with finding her at just the moment the technology made that possible. And so, for the feature debut of an acclaimed commercials director, “Lion” seems awfully brazen advertising its deux ex machina right there in its logline, and though the human story is what makes it so compelling, “advertising” remains the operative word.

Really? says: September 14, 2016 at 8:01 am This is an incredibly smarmy, ill-considered review, one that will likely haunt Variety for years to come. Variety’s managing editors have a problem and his name is Peter DeBruge. Reply SS says: September 13, 2016 at 7:05 pm I usually think you’re a good film critic (everyone but Owen is), but I can’t tell if you liked the film or not. Is it “barely meaty enough to wrap the evening news,” or a “feel-good crowd-pleaser like nobody’s business?” You sort of made an argument for both. Reply hallucigenia11 says: September 13, 2016 at 3:50 pm Sure, and the kind of people who are outraged about the review are the kind of people who don’t understand what ‘deus ex machina’ means… even after looking it up on wikipedia. I’m sure the movie will make millions. Reply Tom says: September 12, 2016 at 3:18 pm totally loved the film. I cried so hard, can’t even eat lunch, yesterday. don’t buy this cynic piece at all. and you can smell the stinks of racism.

Reply Can't Wait says: September 12, 2016 at 12:38 am I read this script… I bawled… how can you say there’s NO PLOT?! I cannot wait to see it. Reply Harvey says: September 11, 2016 at 7:29 pm Seriously Variety. Do all films have to be dark, edgy and downbeat to get a fair review?? Just because your reviewer’s life must be miserable doesn’t mean you should knock films which have heart. Subscription cancelled.

Reply Geri McCall-Barrath says: September 11, 2016 at 5:50 am Wow, your lack of empathy for the human race is only exceeded by D. Trump. No plot? I’ve seen plenty of movies with no plot, and while I have not seen “Lion” yet it sure sounds like an amazing story. Do yourself a favor and don’t write reviews when you’re feeling lousy about your own life. You did this movie a disservice. Time for a vacation to clear out the cobwebs in your head.

Reply Geri McCall-Barrath says: September 11, 2016 at 5:51 am You can say that again.

Two critical vulnerabilities were disclosed but remain unpatched in a large percentage of devices, while, separately, malicious apps were downloaded as many as 2.5 million times from Google's official Play Marketplace. The vulnerabilities, which are similar in severity to the Stagefright family of bugs disclosed last year, have been fixed in updates Google began distributing Tuesday. A large percentage of Android phones, however, aren't eligible to receive the fixes. Even those that do qualify don't receive them immediately (the September updates are currently not available as over-the-air downloads for either of the Nexus 5X devices in my household). That gives attackers crude blueprints for exploiting vulnerabilities that remain unpatched on millions of devices. "Extremely serious bug" The first vulnerability was disclosed by Mark Brand, a researcher with Google's Project Zero security team. Indexed as CVE 2016-3861, it allows attackers to execute malware or escalate local privileges on vulnerable phones. Brand warned that it's "an extremely serious bug" because it can be exploited in a large variety of ways. He also said CVE 2016-3861 wasn't particularly hard to detect, a finding that increases the chances that other researchers already knew about it. (In any event, Brand included exploit code with his disclosure.) Brand didn't say exactly which Android version introduced the code-execution vulnerability, but he indicated that it's present in at least several of the most recent releases. "The provided exploit performs this on several recent Android versions for the Nexus 5x and is both reliable and fast in my testing," he wrote in a blog post published Wednesday. "It would also be possible to make the exploit faster by directly generating the exploit files in javascript, reducing the unnecessary network round-trips [spent] retrieving identical mp4 files." The same Android update patches a separate critical vulnerability that's similar to Stagefright. Cataloged as CVE-2016-3862, it can be exploited by sending a maliciously formatted jpeg image. When sent through Gmail or Google Talk, the malicious code is concealed inside Exif data embedded in the image. The target doesn't need to click on anything to become compromised. "To an advanced attacker, this was relatively easy to find and in their wheelhouse to exploit," Tim Strazzere, director of mobile research at SentinelOne and the researcher who reported the bug to Google, told Threatpost. "You would have access to anything that app had access to or leverage another exploit to get system privileges or root." The vulnerabilities were made public the same week that security firm Checkpoint disclosed that recently discovered apps, some available since April, had been downloaded from Google Play as many as 2.5 million times. One malware family dubbed DressCode was likely used to generate fraudulent clicks on ads, but Checkpoint researchers said it could also be used to breach internal networks and retrieve sensitive files from them. DressCode was found in more than 40 Google Play apps that had been downloaded from 500,000 to 2 million times. In a separate post published Thursday, Checkpoint disclosed an app that contained code that redirected infected phones to websites that generated fraudulent revenue. Known as CallJam, the malware also included code that called fee-based premium phone numbers, although this ability was only invoked after receiving permission from end users. CallJam was embedded into an app called "Gems Chest for Clash Royale," which was downloaded from 100,000 to 500,000 times. The app, as well as those containing DressCode, were removed from Play following the posts.         LATEST STORIES (76) When UN Spurns International Law, Resolution of the Wicked Happens Iran Renews Support for Political Solution to Yemen Crisis Battle for Mosul Day 30: Tal Afar Airport Taken Back Syrian People in Tartus Receive Humanitarian Aids Iraq: ISIL Arrests, Transfers 2,000 Mosul Citizens to Tal Afar for Human Shield Envoy: Giant Russian Energy Firms to Visit Iran for Oil Contracts Kuwait to Replace Riyadh as Main Egypt Oil Supplier Report: ISIL Orders Militants to Avoid Shooting at US-Led Coalition Warplanes Terrorism Index: ISIL Defeats Brought Iraq Deaths down 32% Iran Voices Readiness to Help Cuba in Nanotechnology Russian Military: Terrorists Executing Militants Ready to Surrender in Aleppo Syrian Army Readying to Launch Attack on Al-Bab Iraqi Forces Tap Terrorists' Turkish-Language Communications at Tal Afar Airport Israeli Forces Detain 12-Year-Old, 9 Others in Jerusalem, West Bank Raids Baghdad Deploys Forces only 4 Kilometers Away from Central Mosul When UN Spurns International Law, Resolution of the Wicked Happens TEHRAN (FNA)- The United Nations General Assembly’s Human Rights Committee is supposed to serve with the utmost objectivity and commitment to international law and norms.

The Silicon Valley-based technology colossus has closed parts of the endeavor, which it never publicly confirmed, and laid off dozens of workers as part of a “reboot,” the Times said, citing people briefed on the matter. The team at what Apple named project Titan had grown to more than a thousand people but ran into problems, including showing what it could do differently from other companies working on the technology, according to the Times. Apple fueled speculation about it automotive ambitions this year with a billion-dollar investment in Chinese ride-sharing powerhouse Didi Chuxing. Apple downshifting on Titan comes after pumping resources into it for two years, according to the Times. It also comes as Tesla, major carmakers and rival Google rev investments in autonomous vehicles. Google parent Alphabet and San Francisco-based Uber have both been working on getting self-driving cars on roads. Uber plans to deploy driverless cars for its ride-sharing services in Pittsburgh, pushing the envelope for the use of self-driving technology. At the same time, Uber announced two other moves to further solidify itself as a trailblazer in driverless cars. It established a $300 million venture with Chinese-owned, Sweden-based Volvo Cars to develop self-driving cars for sale by 2021. And Uber is buying Otto, a San Francisco startup developing self-driving commercial trucks. Uber and Volvo were two of the founding members of a coalition unveiled in April to push for a unified US legal code on self-driving cars — a group that also includes Google, carmaker Ford and Uber rival Lyft. Autonomous cars are among big-vision ideas pursued by Google’s X Lab. Google has driven its autonomous cars some 1.5 million miles (2.4 million kilometers) with only some minor dustups. Early this year, the company announced plans for its self-driving car program to put down roots in the Detroit area with a technology center. The facility will house engineers and others testing vehicles provided by Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, Alphabet said at the time. The tech giant began testing its autonomous driving technology in 2009 using a Toyota Prius equipped with Google equipment. It now has some 70 vehicles, including Lexus cars, adapted by Google in addition to its in-house designed cars unveiled in 2014.

How Pittsburgh Became Uber’s Testing Ground By CECILIA KANGSEPT. 10, 2016 Continue reading the main story Share This Page Continue reading the main story Photo Uber cars prepare to roll through Pittsburgh to map out the roads and topography before the introduction of the company’s driverless vehicles. Credit Jeff Swensen for The New York Times PITTSBURGH — Any day now, Uber will introduce a fleet of self-driving cars in Pittsburgh, making this former steel town the world’s first city to let any passenger hail an autonomous vehicle. So with the world watching, what has the city of 306,000 done to prepare for Uber’s unprecedented test? The answer is not much. There have been no public service announcements or demonstrations of the technology. Except for the mayor and one police official, no other top city leader has seen a self-driving Uber vehicle operate up close. Fire and emergency services don’t know where the Uber cars will travel. It is precisely this hands-off approach that has made Pittsburgh ideal grounds for one of Silicon Valley’s boldest experiments — and it has ignited criticism that the city is giving away its keys to Uber, which is testing a nascent technology and has a reputation for running roughshod over regulators and municipalities. Continue reading the main story Advertisement Continue reading the main story “It’s not our role to throw up regulations or limit companies like Uber,” said Bill Peduto, Pittsburgh’s mayor, who said that Uber planned to use about 100 modified Volvo sport utility vehicles for the passenger trials. The vehicles will also have a human monitor behind the wheel. “You can either put up red tape or roll out the red carpet. If you want to be a 21st-century laboratory for technology, you put out the carpet.” Advertisement Continue reading the main story The mayor’s mantra highlights what it takes these days as cities seek to shed their Rust Belt pasts and transform themselves into technology hubs — essentially, give the tech companies lots of free rein. The approach, described as greenlight governing, is one that Pittsburgh and the state of Pennsylvania have nurtured over the last few years. When Uber wanted to expand its research around autonomous vehicles, Pittsburgh helped the company lease a large plot near the city’s riverfront for a testing track. When state regulators tried to ban ride-sharing services in 2014, Pittsburgh’s mayor and the state’s governor helped bat those hurdles down. Otherwise, Pittsburgh’s politicians stay out of the way. Photo Mayor Bill Peduto has worked with Uber to allow access to test its vehicles on Pittsburgh streets. “You can either put up red tape or roll out the red carpet,” he said. Credit Jeff Swensen for The New York Times The approach has many benefits, allowing Pittsburgh and Pennsylvania to position themselves at the forefront of a driverless-vehicle movement that has swept up tech companies including automakers, Google and Baidu of China. It has brought tech entrepreneurs to Pittsburgh and attracted hundreds of scientists and engineers to new research centers opened in the city in the last decade by Apple, Google, Intel and Uber. But it also has invited criticism from those who say Pittsburgh is giving too much power to tech companies, all for a sheen of innovation. Some residents are on edge about Uber’s self-driving vehicles and complain that they have been thrust into an experiment with potential safety risks. “I feel like we were pushed into being part of this by the city,” said Montana Michniak, a recent college graduate who works at a cafe in the city’s South Side neighborhood. How Pittsburgh handles the unveiling of Uber’s self-driving fleet is being closely watched by other tech and auto companies that are doing their own driverless experiments in places like California and Michigan (although Apple is said to have laid off dozens of employees in its self-driving car project and to be rethinking its strategy). Depressed cities around the nation are watching to see if the Pittsburgh story can be a blueprint for their own transitions into tech hubs. “This is the first mayor in Pittsburgh to really get it, and that’s a big reason why the city has become the best case of Rust Belt revival,” said Richard Florida, a professor of urban studies at the University of Toronto, who previously taught at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. He said he was “frankly surprised at how long a leash” Uber got. Mr. Peduto said Uber did not have too much power in Pittsburgh and said the city would be safe because there would be a human monitor in the Uber test cars. The mayor also has his eye on a bigger safety goal.

Photo When Uber wanted to expand its research on autonomous vehicles, Pittsburgh helped the company lease a large plot near the city’s riverfront for a testing track. Credit Jeff Swensen for The New York Times In a statement, Uber said of Pittsburgh, “Our work would not be possible without the support we’ve received from city leaders.” Uber came to Pittsburgh in early 2015, drawn by the engineering talent at Carnegie Mellon. The university started a robotics department 30 years ago, when driverless cars seemed like a fantasy, but robotics has since proved crucial for the systems that let vehicles navigate streets on their own. By this decade, the university’s expertise in computer science had attracted not only Uber but also General Motors, Google and Intel, some of which embedded at Carnegie Mellon. Google and Uber later opened research centers, hiring dozens of Carnegie Mellon professors and graduate students. Today, Uber has 500 employees at a center in Pittsburgh’s industrial Strip District working on autonomous vehicles, according to Mr. Peduto. Uber will have 1,000 employees at the site, known as the Advanced Technology Center, within a few years and plans to increase investments to $1 billion from hundreds of millions of dollars in a decade, he said. For driverless car tests, Pennsylvania also held a legal advantage. Specifically, the state’s transportation rules did not explicitly ban driverless cars, as long as someone was behind the wheel to take over if needed. Officials from Pennsylvania’s transportation agency said they interpreted that silence on driverless technology as a green light. Some state officials said they also believed that driverless cars could be safer than those steered by drivers, helping avoid driver-related deaths. “We’d be committing governmental malpractice if we didn’t pursue this technology,” said Roger Cohen, the policy director of the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation. Photo Driverless cars with Uber’s logo have cruised around town for months, in part to get the public used to seeing them. Credit Jeff Swensen for The New York Times In Pittsburgh, Mr. Peduto fostered a close relationship with Uber. In Mr. Peduto’s first meeting in early 2015 with Uber’s chief executive, Travis Kalanick, Mr. Kalanick said he had noticed efforts by Mr. Peduto and other officials to fight the state public utilities commission’s proposed ban on ride-sharing services like Uber and Lyft in 2014. Mr. Kalanick also laid out a plan for Uber’s driverless cars. Advertisement Continue reading the main story “Travis’s vision was to build out the autonomous vehicles industry in 10 years,” Mr. Peduto said. “We shared a vision to do it in a way that would be a benefit for society.” Weeks later, in a meeting with President Obama at a conference for the National League of Cities, Mr. Peduto urged Mr. Obama to support autonomous vehicles and declared Pittsburgh’s intention to be a testing ground. Since then, Pittsburgh has showed its friendliness to Uber’s efforts. Last year, it also worked with the city’s police department on plans to install a ride-hailing kiosk in the lively South Side district, for the use of people who had been drinking and would prefer not to drive home. Pittsburgh International Airport last year also designated waiting areas for Uber and Lyft passengers. Yet Uber has mostly gone ahead with its self-driving-car plans in Pittsburgh alone. Driverless cars with Uber’s logo have cruised around town for months, in part to get the public used to seeing them. With cameras and GPS units mounted on the roofs, the vehicles collect mapping data on plants and trees, the conditions of sidewalks, and traffic markings for nearly every street. “There’s really not been a whole lot of collaboration on the actual testing,” said Scott Schubert, Pittsburgh’s assistant chief of police, who rode in one of the Uber vehicles last June and signed a nondisclosure agreement to do so. Last month, Uber officially announced that the self-driving fleet would go into action in Pittsburgh. Mr. Peduto, who had been informed a few days earlier by Uber, sent a congratulatory text message to Mr. Kalanick. Uber’s chief was in Pittsburgh at the time and invited the mayor to be the city’s first driverless-car passenger. After the two-mile ride home, Mr. Peduto posted on Twitter that he ended that day as the world’s first mayor chauffeured by an autonomous Uber car. “I feel fortunate that I have the ear of a C.E.O. of one of the biggest privately held companies,” he said. Correction: September 14, 2016 An article on Sunday about Uber’s introduction of self-driving cars to Pittsburgh misstated the surname of the city’s assistant chief of police. He is Scott Schubert, not Schuster. Kitty Bennett contributed research. A version of this article appears in print on September 11, 2016, on page A1 of the New York edition with the headline: No Driver? Bring It On. How Pittsburgh Became Uber’s Test City.

Tech Insider BI Intelligence Events Trending Tech Insider Finance Politics Strategy Life Sports Video All × From To You have successfully emailed the post. 17 Google products that bombed, died, or disappeared Avery Hartmans Sep. 7, 2016, 7:00 AM 321,174 facebook linkedin twitter email print Google cofounders Larry Page and Sergey Brin.Ben Margot/AP Images Google is known for its collection of wildly popular products, from search to maps to Android. But not everything the company touches turns to gold. Google Glass was supposed to change the world, but it quickly became a punch line. Remember Google Buzz? Of course the best innovations are the ones that everybody thinks are doomed to fail. So it makes sense that Google has had its fair share of misses over the years. How many products have ended up in the Google graveyard? We counted 17, but there are probably more (let us know in the comments section below). Here's a look at some of Google's biggest misses: View As: One Page Slides Google Answers was the first project Google worked on and started as an idea from Larry Page. Answers lasted for more than four years but stopped accepting questions in 2006. Google Source Lively, Google's virtual worlds, lasted a little over a year. Google said it created Lively because it "wanted users to be able to interact with their friends and express themselves online in new ways," but it just didn't catch on. Lively was shut down in 2008. Flickr/Dave White Source Google first unveiled Glass in dramatic fashion in 2012, but the device never made it to the masses. Glass came with a high price tag, software issues, potential privacy problems, and it generally looked too nerdy. Google ended consumer sales of Glass in January 2015, but it continues to sell the device to businesses and is working on a new version. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Source Google Buzz was a social-networking service that was integrated into Gmail, but it was plagued with problematic privacy issues and never caught on. The company announced in October 2011 it would shut down the service to focus on Google+ instead. Flickr/Rick Turoczy Source The Google Play edition Android phone was introduced in the spring of 2014. But by January 2015, they were listed as "no longer available for sale" and a Galaxy S5 edition of the phone never materialized, despite leaked photos appearing online. Google Source Google Wave was designed to let people message each other and edit documents together, but users were confused by it and it quickly flopped. Wave lasted about a year before it was killed in August 2010. Flickr/Harto Pönkä Source Google Video was Google's own video-streaming service, launched before the company bought YouTube in 2006. Google Video stopped accepting new uploads in 2009, but Video and Youtube coexisted until August 2012 when Google shut down Video for good. Source Google's Nexus Q, a streaming media player that was designed to connect all home devices, was unveiled with great fanfare at the company's 2012 developer conference. Reviews of the $299 Q in tech blogs were brutal, and Google shelved the product before it ever went for sale to the public. Steve Kovach, Business Insider Source Google X, an alternative interface for the search engine, lasted exactly one day before Google pulled the plug. A strange tribute to Mac OS X's dock, the site said: "Roses are red. Violets are blue. OS X rocks. Homage to you." Google X was quickly taken offline on March 16, 2005, and today the name has been repurposed as Google's research division. Screenshot Source Originally intended to give people access to health and wellness information, Google Health was closed for good in January 2012 after Google observed the service was "not having the broad impact that we hoped it would." Joe Raedle/Getty Images Source Google Reader was a news-reading app that let users pull in stories from blogs or news sites. Google announced it was shutting down Reader in March 2013 — much to users' dismay and outrage — and it was officially killed in July 2013. screenshot/Julie Zeveloff Source Google Catalogs, an interactive shopping program that digitized catalogs, was shut down in 2015. Google shuttered the mobile version of Catalogs in 2013 and shut down the desktop version two years later. YouTube/Google Source Google Hangouts On Air — Google's live-streaming service — is moving to YouTube Live beginning September 2016. The service was originally created in 2012 when live streaming was catching on and was once used by President Obama and Pope Francis. Google Source Dodgeball, a service that let users check in at locations, was purchased by Google in 2005. Its founders, which included Dennis Crowley, left Google seemingly on bad terms in 2007 and Crowley went on to build a very similar service, Foursquare, two years later. Brian Ach/Getty Images for TechCrunch Source iGoogle, a personalized homepage, was shut down in 2013. Created in 2005, iGoogle allowed users to customize their homepage with widgets. Google said iGoogle wasn't needed as much anymore since apps could run on Chrome and Android. Flickr/Robert Kelley Source Orkut was once a popular social-networking service that grew out of a Googler's "20% time" project. The site was more popular abroad than it was in the US and Google decided to kill it in September 2014. Flickr/Peter Kaminski Source Google Notebook was a precursor to Google Docs and was a place to copy and paste URLs or write notes that could be shared or published. Google stopped development on Notebook in 2009 and officially shut it down in July 2012, transferring all data from Notebook to Google Docs.

While the Photos app in iOS 10 is better than ever, Google is making sure that it stays out of the competition. Now, Google has seen fit to update its Google Photos app on iOS that has a cool new feature up its sleeves – the ability to easily convert Live Photos into GIFs or movies. This feature was previously available on iOS but you would have to download a separate app for it. Convert Live Photos Into GIFs with Google Photos If you have the Motion Stills app installed on your iPhone to convert Live Photos into GIFs, you can might as well forgo it in favor of the Google Photos app. Nonetheless, it’s totally your call if you’re good with controls and operations on the prior. Motion Stills lets you create short movies with a pinch of cinematic elements and much more. You also have the ability to freeze the background motion while keeping it on the foreground if you want to jump your movies up a notch. Google writes: “Live Photos bring photos to life with sound and motion, but can suffer from the everyday bumps and shakes that happen when you take photos. Plus, they can be hard to share with friends who don’t have an iPhone,” Apart from the ability to convert Live Photos into GIFs, the update also integrates advanced rendering along with stabilization features. This will ensure that the images you capture are super smooth. The techniques used in the Google Photos app is pretty much similar to that found in the company’s Motion Stills app. The stabilized Live Photos can then be easily saved and shared on social media. For more information on how the stabilization is achieved, check out this official explanation on Google’s Research blog. Advertisement Moreover, the advanced stabilized algorithms run directly on your device rather allowing your phone to connect to the internet. So the lead time between operation is comparatively minimized and you’ll end up with sharp, smooth images which can be shared with your friends. There are a bunch of other additions surrounding the update as well, allowing the app to select thumbnail for faces inside the People album, sorting album photos chronologically and much more. So if you’re interested, be sure to install Google Photos if you haven’t already. What is your go-to app for managing and backing up photos on your iOS device? Do you think integrating the the ability to convert Live Photos into GIFs on Google Photos makes Motion Stills app redundant? Let us know in the comments.

Wccftech News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile  ⋮  Web Google Finally Responds to Microsoft’s Chrome Complaints with Its Own Tests By Rafia Shaikh Posted 2 months ago 18Shares Share Tweet Submit Microsoft started a messy war earlier this year when it showed that Chrome was really bad for battery life and Edge was the cure for all browser-problems. Months have passed since the software giant posted the side-by-side comparison specifically hitting Chrome and Opera. Now, Google is finally ready to respond and has claimed that its browser is experiencing double-digit improvements in not only battery life but speed too when compared to last year. Chrome experiences double-digit battery life and speed improvements Responding to Microsoft’s tests conducted in June showing that Chrome is the most battery intensive browser on Windows 10, Google has now run similar tests. Chrome 53 that was released last week is shown in the latest tests, delivering 2 hours and 12 minutes of longer HD video playback when compared to version 46 from last October. Google has also used Surface Books in the new comparison video to show that its latest browser version is much improved than a year ago. Over the last year Chrome has seen double-digit improvements in speed and battery life. These improvements help you get more done, faster, and we thought you’d like an update. When measured with tools like Speedometer, improvements over the last year have made Chrome more than 15 percent faster on both desktop and Android. That’s good news if you’re working against a deadline or trying to place a last-minute order. Advertisement Google updated its browser for Windows with Material Design and battery improvements over the weekend. Latest video focuses on version 53 playing HTML5 video from Vimeo, Facebook and YouTube on Windows. The company had previously promised to bring battery life and performance improvements. With a focus on video playback, it isn’t certain if we will see similar improvements when browsing regular websites on Windows. As for the speed, Google has claimed that its browser on the desktop and Android is now 15% faster than it was a year ago. Not only Windows, Chrome for Mac also now uses 33% less power when viewing images or watching videos. While Google isn’t claiming if Chrome 53 resolves all the issues, it does seem to be finally taking care of the most critical problems that users face with the browser – battery life and speed.

Samsung’s Galaxy Note 7, which started off strong, came across a huge obstacle once numerous reports of spontaneous combustion started rolling in. Although Samsung responded quickly (and appropriately) to the issue, they’ve undoubtedly taken a blow to their reputation. There’s also the iPhone 7, which featured a number of important upgrades, but is also under heavy scrutiny due to the removal of the standard 3.5mm headphone jack. The next “big” smartphone to make an appearance for our expected fall line-up is Google’s Nexus – or perhaps Google’s Pixel, as rumors would have us believe – which is predicted to make its official appearance sometime in early October. Here’s to hoping that Google’s release, whether it’s Nexus, Pixel, or otherwise, is a good one, because this year seems like easy money thanks to hiccups with the competition. However, it’s going to take more than riding off of competitor's issues to make this year successful for Google. Assuming that Google is retiring the Nexus name in favor of Pixel, the move could end up paying off better than initially expected. Aside from bringing a better sense of unity to Google’s mobile lineup (matching a Pixel-branded phone with its Pixel C tablet), if Google can up its marketing game, this could be the year that the phone formerly known as Nexus could really garner some attention. In the past, the Nexus wasn’t exactly well-known outside of tech enthusiast circles. Between lack of marketing and official carrier support (most of the time), if a general consumer didn’t know somebody that could point them in the direction of Nexus or use Google-fu to conduct smartphone research on their own, they probably had no idea that Nexus even existed. Lack of prior knowledge of the device is a big reason why I think this year is as good of a year as any to really push Nexus (or Pixel) forward – there are hardly any prejudices to be had against the Nexus, at least when you compare them to more recognizable smartphone brands. Although neither of the two expected Google phones have been officially announced, it’s expected that smartphone manufacturer HTC will be the company assisting Google in designing both, codenamed Sailfish and Marlin. HTC is the same company that made aluminum unibody design commonplace in the mobile industry with the introduction of the HTC One (M7) back in 2013. Since then, HTC has had ups and downs with its One line, but hardly due to its design. As an avid fan of HTC’s design in the One series, I suspect that Sailfish and Marlin could end up being considered two of the most well-designed Nexus devices ever created – which can only boost morale for the devices, as the look and feel of a smartphone is often extremely important to consumers. Ultimately, the potential for Google’s success is almost perfectly set up: recent competition isn't wholly at its best, the manufacturer behind both of Google’s smartphones’ designs has a high chance of producing something really premium, and Google as a company is this massive advertising giant that already has the means and resources to market the crap out of the Nexus/Pixel if they really wanted to. Assuming the phones have headphone jacks, don’t explode, don’t stray too far from stock Android (at the very least keeping a clean interface), and really just stay away from any other massive blunders, this could be a great year for Google. Only time will tell, but I for one am kind of on the edge of my seat waiting see if Google takes advantage of the situation and drives their smartphones home this year.

ADVERTISEMENT On Our Radar Refresh Close On Our Radar Load More The Cloud and Mobile Revolution: What’s Next? By Maja Tarateta Published September 07, 2016 Cloud Innovations FOXBusiness Facebook Twitter Comments Print When it comes to the Cloud, experts say, right now, it’s all about “magical convenience.” Continue Reading Below As in, making things happen just by asking, no matter where you are. “The big revolution is the growth of the Cloud and mobile,” said Evangelos Katsamakas, associate professor of information systems at Fordham University. “A smart phone is basically a computer. It’s like a remote control for the Cloud. You can request a taxi, share a photo or find directions. It’s a magical thing.” What has the Cloud done for you lately? Most likely, more than you realize. Sharing and Storing Photos Boxes of fading images, gathering dust in closets and desk drawers, unorganized, difficult to share with friends and family. These are the relics of photos past. Patrick Austin, associate editor, electronics, at Consumer Reports, cites photo storage and sharing as one of the top ways the Cloud has made life easier. Continue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT “Google Drive, Dropbox, these are all easy ways to store photos, documents, videos, funny GIFs,” he said. “You can snap some photos and they go to Google Drive and you can share them with family and friends. No more going to develop film or burning CDs. Just give them a link.” The Cloud even makes it easier to find that “missing” photo that used to mean hours flipping through stacks of images. “Facial recognition with Google Photo [and iPhoto and others] lets you search for a picture by typing the name of the person,” said Giuseppe Ateniese, director of the computer science department at Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, New Jersey. “This is machine learning from aggregated algorithms.” (Made possible by the Cloud.) Limitless Storage and Device Flexibility “Right now, we assume that we have unlimited storage — pictures, emails, files — all stored with no limitations,” said Ateniese. “We have unlimited storage that kids take for granted and everything — movies, music — all is immediately available on any computing device.” Once upon a time, a work computer was difficult (impossible?) to access from home. Many a heavy laptop was lugged on back-and-forth commutes so that work information could be accessed away from work. But with the Cloud, “You are no longer tied to a desk or a device,” said Austin. “And if you have an idea at home, you can just go into Dropbox or Google Docs” and immediately share it and have access to it on all your devices.” Shared “living” documents that multiple people can access and add to through the Cloud also improve work productivity and make lives easier. “We take for granted that all the information is synced among the different devices — laptops, cellphones, desktops,” said Ateniese. “Right now, we are using the Cloud mostly for storage and availability of data. But we should not forget that the Cloud is also about computation. The Cloud is a set of remote servers, and we can exploit the power of these servers.” Future Applications Today, tech companies are thinking way beyond these simple ways that the Cloud is improving lives, delving into deeper applications that involve concepts like predictive analytics, virtual reality and artificial intelligence to add to convenience and improve experience, based on aggregate data. “Health applications will probably be one of the most compelling future applications of the Cloud,” said Ateniese. “The Cloud will aggregate data from sensors in laptops and other devices to give a picture of the health of users. This will be extremely important in the future.” Streaming-video companies, like Netflix, will be able to anticipate what movie people will want to watch next on a much more accurate basis, and will suggest it, all by correlating data. “From a consumer perspective, we give up control for ease,” said Katsamakas, who cites artificial intelligence as a big theme going forward. “The Cloud is becoming smarter by itself over time.” “In some ways, there is added convenience,” he continued. “But big companies know everything about you, sometimes even better than you know yourself.” “People love the convenience,” agreed Austin, “until it gets creepy and people feel it is being used against them.” For now, he argues, “there’s not that much to worry about.” What do you think?

Well unfortunately, for those who have skeletons in their search engine history closet, Google keeps a full record of every search you have ever made- removed searches and all. Alamy 3 All your Google searches have actually been recorded But the good news for secretive searchers is that only you can access your record and it is fairly simple to stop Google from collecting the data. The system works by tracking everything you search for when logged in to your Gmail or Google account, it then keeps a record of all of it, whether you remove it from your search history or not. Getty Images 3 There’s no need to panic you can stop the data from being collected very easily If this is your worst fears being realised then don’t worry, you can take a look at your own awkward/embarrassing history, right down to the first search, using this link: history.google.com/history You can even analyse the information using their handy “search my searches” tool. But the cringe factor doesn’t stop there; you can also review all your image searches and check which videos you’ve been watching on YouTube over the years.

Ford CEO Mark Fields says they will move their production of the Ford Focus to Mexico to create room for "two very important products" coming to the Michigan factories. Fields states that this will not affect on jobs in Michigan what so ever. President-elect Donald Trump has criticized Ford for the decision to shift production to Mexico, and said he would consider levying tariffs on Mexican-made Fords.

The Venetians were impressed (they doubled Galileo’s salary and gave him lifetime tenure at the University of Padua) because they immediately saw the huge financial and military advantages offered by this visionary device. A few hundred years later, we are on the cusp of an equally radical transformation in how information is gathered, analyzed and monetized. And if we pay attention, we might even save the planet. The number of satellites orbiting Earth increased 40 percent in just the past five years, and those hunks of metal are snapping pictures at a mind-blowing rate. This explosion of images isn’t just the National Security Agency feverishly peeking into your bedroom and laptop; it’s a revolution that’s going to radically change how we respond to environmental disasters and run our farms. It’s also going to upend the stock market, because it’s turning the whole world into usable data, giving us a precise count of oil tankers in all the world’s ports and how many cars are in a Wal-Mart parking lot. Know that, and you can—like Galileo’s Venetian pals—make some very lucrative investments. That’s why dozens of companies are racing to get into orbit. Seattle-based BlackSky Global is planning to launch six spacecraft; Terra Bella, a Google-Alphabet subsidiary, has two satellites in orbit and promises video that can “see objects up to the size of a car,” while Spire owns 10 orbiting satellites and plans to take millions of pictures of the world’s oceans. These and other upstarts are chasing imaging giants like DigitalGlobe, Airbus and Rapid Eye, who have hundreds of millions of dollars of hardware floating miles above our heads. But no one has launched as fast and as often as Planet, a startup running out of an old gray warehouse in San Francisco’s Mission District. In a neighborhood filled mostly with vintage furniture stores, hip restaurants and coffee shops, Planet has 62 satellites in orbit, the world’s largest private collection, and by the end of the year it will have 100, enough that every nook, cranny and keyhole on Earth will get its own medium-resolution photo every single day. This avalanche of images will create an unprecedented database of the entire planet, one that can be used to stop forest fires and maybe even wars. < PREVIOUS SLIDESLIDE 1 of 8NEXT SLIDE > Daily photos covering the entire world could keep better track of wildfires, such as this one in Southern California photographed by a NASA satellite in 2007. (NASA) © Provided by IBT Media What Hath Smartphone Wrought? Nothing about launching a satellite is cheap or easy, but what if you could just hurl your iPhone into orbit? In 2010, two NASA Ames Research Center engineers, Will Marshall and Chris Boshuizen, basically did just that. They realized that the power of the phones in their pockets far outstripped anything in orbit in terms of computing power, and the tech underneath that glass screen has a lot of overlap with the nuts and bolts of most satellites. “You have to have power, batteries, GPS, a transmitter,” says Marshall, “all that was missing were solar panels to keep them charged and a system to orient it in space.” The duo went to Nevada’s Black Rock Desert and strapped a few smartphones onto amateur rockets to see if they could handle the g-force and vibrations of a launch. This seat-of-the-pants test wasn’t NASA-approved—“We hadn't really told anyone what we were doing,” Marshall says—but it was a success. The phones were able to handle the vibrations of a launch and the vacuum of space, so the engineers convinced NASA to try a bigger test. By late 2013, the agency was officially on board, putting them in charge of a mission to launch three modified Google Nexus 1 phones on a rocket to the International Space Station, where they were dropped into orbit. The phones flew around the globe, happily chirping back photos to be collected by amateur radio operators down on Earth. The final cost: just $3,500. The three tiny spaceships used for that mission—nicknamed Alexander, Graham and Bell—took very low-resolution, almost useless, images. But Boshuizen and Marshall, now working with NASA engineer Robbie Schingler, saw a huge opportunity: They wanted to make a space company (Planet) that moved like a tech company, upgrading its electronics constantly, like Apple does with the iPhone. Instead of planning a mission years out, as NASA does, Planet started building and launching cheap and fast—and just kept upgrading. Even after all their upgrades, Planet’s pictures won’t be the best on the market for resolution. You can see buildings, but details like cars are harder to make out. The stunning images available on Google Maps, for example, are much clearer, but that higher resolution requires bigger satellites, some the size of a bedroom, with lenses that have to be carefully aimed. That means they can only image a tiny part of the planet in a day. Planet doesn’t want to compete with these high-end images—it’s going for quantity. It just wants to slap a 3-foot telescope, some electric motors and solar panels to phone parts. Its satellites are cheap and small enough to cram into a nook on a rocket, allowing them to hitch on bigger space cargo trips, further reducing costs. The picture is just decent, but each photo-snapping satellite is so inexpensive that the company can line them up like pearls on a string high in the sky, running from the North Pole to South Pole, and create an extraordinarily rich database that will reveal how the Earth changes. Of course, those millions of images will be little more than a curiosity unless there’s a way to turn them into usable data. Not that long ago, getting a computer to recognize an image—a simple task for humans: Which of these 10 photos is one of Mom?—required supercomputers and algorithms written by entire university computer science departments, and even then the results were pretty fuzzy. Planet was lucky—it came along at just the right time to harness the power of one of the hottest fields in computer science: machine learning. Scientist have made huge gains with computers that act more like your brain—turn those computers loose on massive amounts of data, and they “learn” how to solve problems on their own. In 2012, Google coupled a neural network with a massive database built out of YouTube videos. Because it was YouTube, the computer eventually got pretty good at recognizing cats. Since then, machine learning has popped up in a lot of places online—it’s what lets Facebook match your friends to their faces when you upload photos, for instance. Computers have always been able to do things with numbers that humans never could; now they can do the same thing with images. That means you can point a computer to something in Planet’s archive of photos, like a baseball field, and then tell it to find and count every one on Earth. You could do the same for airfields in Europe or chemical plants in Africa. Planet could, according to one analyst, provide a daily count of every tree on the planet. Of course, there’s not a lot of money to be made counting trees—but somebody could get stupid-rich counting barrels of oil. Governments and commodity traders spend billions of dollars every year trying to get a handle on the oil industry, but the market is so wild that experts have called it broken or even rigged. Satellites offer a solution, because most oil is stored in giant cylinders. To keep explosive gas from building up in these big tanks, the lids float atop the oil, rising and falling as they get filled and emptied. Position a camera directly above one of those tanks, create a time-lapse video, you’d see a crescent shadow that would get slightly larger as the tank drained and the lid sank. A math whiz (or a computer) can then calculate how much oil is in that tank based on the time of day, the tank’s diameter and its shadows. It’s a neat trick people have been using for years—with the help of helicopter photos—to game the oil market. But with Planet’s images and machine learning, anyone could figure out how much oil is being stored all over the world (and place million-dollar bets accordingly). You could do the same with the number of shipping containers entering Seattle, or trucks parked at every manufacturing plant in China—data that could predict where key markets are headed. At least, that’s Orbital Insight’s business model. It is based on a quiet street that might house a tax preparer in most of the country, but in Palo Alto, California, it’s home to another space startup looking to change the world. Inside a nondescript, two-story office building, Orbital Insight’s founder, James Crawford—who worked in artificial intelligence and, with Google Books, helped digitize every page of every book in the world—calls up a graph that shows how many cars were spotted in all the parking lots of a major American clothing retailer (that he preferred not be named here) and the company’s income over the past five years. The two lines move in tandem through spikes and dips. In the latest quarter—a period for which the company has yet to report earnings—the cars-in-the-lot count looks pretty good. “We’re showing [the clothing retailer] slightly up,” Crawford says, “which is interesting because the market is showing them down.” You can almost hear a broker shouting, “Buy!” Tractors in Outer Space Most of Orbital Insight’s customers now are in finance, but the imagery revolution could have an even bigger impact in agriculture and, strangely, the quest for world peace. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has an annual budget of $180 million for data-crunching our food supplies, as well as a pretty good track record without using satellites: Its predictions on output are normally off by just 4 percent. But Descartes Labs, a satellite image analysis company, believes it has a new tool that can beat that. Most chlorophyll-filled plants, as you may remember from junior high biology, absorb the full spectrum of light except green, which gives them their tint. Chlorophyll also reflects near-infrared light, which is just outside the visible spectrum for humans, but by looking at infrared in a photo, you can get a pretty good look at the density of chlorophyll—high density is a sign of good plant health. Descartes can use chlorophyll density images, taken by satellites, to predict agricultural output. According to CEO Mark Johnson, the Descartes algorithm’s prediction of corn output was off by just 2.5 percent for the last 10 years. That may seem like news fit for Page 24 of a sleepy commodity markets publication, but poor food production predictions can lead to armed confrontations on a street near you. Wheat prices, for instance, spiked right before the Arab Spring, and a drought has been cited as one of causes of the French Revolution. “If you look at [the emergence of] Boko Haram and even ISIS, both were preceded by food shortages,” Johnson says. Descartes plans to move beyond corn to other crops and beyond the U.S. to make international estimates as well. But to do that, it needs images with a much higher resolution than what’s being shot now over rural areas. “Understanding activity in a field, differentiating between different types of crops—you can’t do that at low resolution,” Johnson says. That’s why Descartes is starting to use Planet’s images. Other companies are using satellites to maximize output on individual farms. For years, growers have tried to farm efficiently by applying different amounts of fertilizer to different parts of their land, depending on the soil type. That meant they had to divide the farm into a giant grid and test the soil type of each square. But with satellite images, a lot of that can be automated. A Canadian company called Farmers Edge can take the satellite image, run it through an algorithm and quickly figure out the soil makeup of each part of the field. The company sends signals directly to tractors that automatically apply the right type of fertilizer for each area. The process could save farmers money and get them to use less fertilizer, which will curb the runoff of nitrate into rivers. Cutting pollution is just one social benefit satellites will bring. “We finally have the tech to understand the planet as a living organism,” Johnson says. He sees Descartes’s mission as a “living analysis of the world, where we understand the resources we mine, grow and take out of the ground, and watch how we humans use them.” Execution by Anti-Aircraft Gun For most of history, humans had never seen a full picture of Earth. In the 1960s, as the space race heated up, a portrait that showed the whole planet became something of a holy grail. Former Merry Prankster and Whole Earth Catalog founder Stewart Brand started lobbying NASA to release an image of the planet in 1966. When the Apollo 17 crew returned with the Blue Marble image on December 7, 1972, Brand slapped it on the cover of his magazine and expected human consciousness to blossom. It did, sort of: There was something about seeing ourselves suspended in the blackness of space. Having a picture of our planet that changes with time could fundamentally alter how we think about ourselves and our environment. And it could change how we act, and react to disasters. On April 14, 2016, just weeks away from the presidential election of Peru, the front page of the most influential newspaper in the country ran two images taken by DigitalGlobe. The first, from November 2015, showed the rainforest verdant and full, broken only by a muddy lake. The second was taken in April 2016 and showed the same stretch of forest torn open, the lake bigger and, most critically, man-made structures spreading like the tendrils of a tumor. It was proof of “deforestation caused by gold seekers in the Tambopata Reserve,” the front page read. The photos sparked a national debate about illegal mining in the jungle that became a large part of the presidential election. Those images were discovered and released by the Amazon Conservation Association, a group with people on the ground in parts of the Andean Amazon disappearing the fastest, as well as a team of satellite analysts working in Washington, D.C. Matt Fine, a research specialist with the ACA, gets alerts from a University of Maryland program that automatically scans the forest and flags new signs of deforestation using NASA’s Landsat images. The two Landsat spacecraft take pictures of the whole planet, but the photos are low-resolution and updated only every 16 days. “You can confirm or deny deforestation is happening, but you can't see the forest,” Finer says. “It doesn’t really pull at your heartstrings too much.” But once he gets a Landsat image alert, Finer can track down better and more up-to-date images from Planet that show changes almost as they happen, and at a resolution where the changes in the twists of a river, for instance, are visible. It used to take months to find a story of environmental degradation; it now takes days, and activists can rally policymakers and voters in time to make a difference. Other companies are using satellite images to protect cultural landmarks or hapless citizens under the boot of a demonic despot. AllSource Analysis, based in Longmont, Colorado, uses the photos to tell stories about “places that are too hard, too dangerous or too remote to travel to,” for governments, nongovernmental organizations and commercial groups, according to Stephen Wood, the company’s CEO. For example, AllSource tracked the destruction of Iraq’s oldest Christian monastery by the Islamic State group (ISIS) and saw North Korea using anti-aircraft guns in executions. When a tsunami smashed into Japan in 2011, the AllSource team stayed up through the night to aid search-and-rescue efforts and then monitored a full-on nuclear meltdown at a huge power plant. “We were watching Fukushima as it was going through these changes, including blowing up a few times, and we’re one of the few people in the world seeing this,” Wood says. “We would see these villages, beautiful fishing villages, right after the tsunami had come through…just complete and utter devastation.” Planet’s Marshall says they were able to find an entire village that had vanished in a mudslide after Nepal’s quake in 2015. No one would have known to send help if someone hadn’t compared before and after images. Search-and-rescue missions and rapid disaster response are two areas where a regularly updated visual database of the full planet can save lives and even the planet. Black Boxes and John Prine It’s hard not to bang your head on low-hanging puns at Planet’s headquarters—work jargon like space and launch have much bigger import here. The employees make the most of the fact that they all work “in” space—they refer to themselves as “planeteers” and celebrate “flight-suit Friday’s.” (The flight suits aren’t company-issue, but there are quite a few to pick from on Etsy, an employee tells me.) At first glance, it looks like the office of a generic tech company—there’s a giant rack of bikes, a tasteful cafeteria with exposed brick, fridges stocked with coconut water, a sound system playing John Prine and the Kinks. It moves like a tech company too. Planet created 13 versions of its satellites in just over three years, a rate of iteration even Steve Jobs would have envied. But there are plenty of signs that Planet is working on something bigger than an Uber for ice cream. Just off the cafeteria is a door leading to its clean room, where engineers are assembling the delicate electronic innards for the company’s main product: satellites. A left turn brings you to a padded black box, an “anechoic chamber” that blocks radio signals so engineers can test radios without interference from cellphones or TV stations. Upstairs are rows of desks and blackboards scribbled with what looks to me like some dauntingly serious math. There’s also a giant wall of screens—kind of like what you see in photos of NASA’s command and control center—that tracks the movement of each of the company’s satellites, tracing parabolas over the planet, constantly snapping photos as they go. They’ve launched enough satellites that they’re beyond champagne celebrations. Eight went up in the week before my visit in early summer. Each Planet satellite is a work of art, in part because an artist adds swirling designs and a touch of individuality to each. But the extra care doesn’t mean they’re going to last. All orbiting satellites are always falling, losing a tiny amount of speed and altitude with each trip around Earth. Bigger, more expensive satellites push themselves back up with small thrusters, but Planet allows its satellites to drop. After about two years of going around and around, they re-enter the atmosphere and briefly turn into a shooting star as they burn up. Planet has launched 133, and 51 are still operational. I’m not good at math, but I know that’s a lot of shooting stars. Counting trees or even oil tanks doesn’t sound sexy, and it may not even be important if you’re not an investor or a tree hugger, but this technology is going to snake into every byway and back alley on Earth, and show us things we want to see, along with many things we didn’t know we needed to see. Back at that big wall of monitors, a “planeteer” pulls up an image from Aleppo, Syria. It’s not supercrisp, like what you get from Google Earth, but I can make out what’s going on down there—I can see berms being built. Someone explains to me that people are frantically digging earthen barriers to protect their homes and their families from suicide car bombers. And I suddenly feel horror, fear and guilt. It’s a tiny detail from a vast panoply of human endeavors, one that the curve of the Earth normally obscures from us, but for a minute it makes that war on the other side of the planet feel a little closer and stopping it a lot more urgent.

PHOTO| COURTESY  In Summary Communicating through messages on social media might seem like a time-wasting activity, but one Nairobi resident has learnt how to make money out of it. Mr Seth Kariuki, 36, sells land, cars, branding services among other items by sending direct messages to Facebook and Twitter users. For the last three years, Mr Kariuki has been a regular fixture in inboxes of some users as he looks for buyers. Advertisement By ELVIS ONDIEKI More by this Author By VINCENT ACHUKA More by this Author Nothing is permanent except change, so goes the saying. And change has been the constant in the careers arena over the years, with some jobs emerging every day while others fade into extinction. As the latest technological innovations spread in Kenya, careers pegged on the Internet are gaining prominence while those like being a switchboard operator, typist and video store clerks head for the back seat. Tasks that previously seemed like a pastime are now turning into full-time careers, with some organisations creating spaces for positions like social media marketers, online customer care agents and YouTubers among others. Dr Mike Iravo, a human resource lecturer at the Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology, advises Kenyan employers to develop strategies to adapt to the change while minding the welfare of employees whose roles become redundant. “You can’t just start (phasing them out) all of a sudden. Let us go slowly as we phase them out. As we retire them, we then insist on people who should have these technology skills,” he told Lifestyle. Dr Iravo said that the new posts in the workplace are inevitable, especially with the onset of social media. “The way the world is going, we need to embrace the social media, although this can be preserved within time so that everybody comes on board,” he said. TIMELY DELIVERY On the advantages of social media to businesses, Dr Iravo said: “I see a lot of strategies being created for organisations through the employees. I see a lot of information being delivered on time. I see the exchange of skills between employees and others being enhanced.” According to Mr Justin Anyona, an agency relationship manager at Google Kenya, the expanding digital space is guaranteed to create more jobs with time. One of the spaces is YouTube, a platform for sharing videos. “It’s phenomenal. Look at youngsters of 13 to 18; the sort of content they watch. YouTube has really taken off. And there are all these sorts of YouTube stars, people who only log on to YouTube and they become huge. Some are even bigger than TV stars,” said Mr Anyona. “It’s quite big and it’s just about doing interesting content, getting subscribers, getting people to view your videos, and then now you work with Google and YouTube to monetise the content.” Another platform for making money, he said, is by helping websites rank higher on search results from search engines. “Some agencies … make for you websites and then they also offer an extra service of making sure that it’s properly optimised for search engines,” he said. Lifestyle looks into some of the jobs that have emerged in Kenya due to technological advancement, as told through youths who took a leap of faith and are now making money out of it. 1. SOCIAL MEDIA MARKETER Communicating through messages on social media might seem like a time-wasting activity, but one Nairobi resident has learnt how to make money out of it. Mr Seth Kariuki, 36, sells land, cars, branding services among other items by sending direct messages to Facebook and Twitter users. For the last three years, Mr Kariuki has been a regular fixture in inboxes of some users as he looks for buyers. He markets products belonging to other proprietors and gets a commission per sale. When he spoke to Lifestyle, he was looking for land for an energy company that wanted prime plots countrywide. He was also chasing a branding deal with a coffee shop. “You have to look for clients online through their Facebook pages, and their links. I also network a lot with people,” says the former banker. “I inbox, I ask for the numbers of a person I can talk to.” He runs at least four Facebook accounts through which he reaches potential buyers. To achieve that, he has adopted software that sends daily messages to Facebook users.  While social media marketing takes many perspectives, Mr Kariuki says his model works for him because it is cost-effective. “It is easy. You can work from anywhere: from office, from the house, provided you have Internet,” says the father of one. He says he makes enough to sustain his family, noting that if one works hard, one will not regret. “What you need to do is know the people you work with and to know what you’re selling,” he says. Going through one of his Facebook accounts, one realises that some of the posts are jokes that don’t relate to business in any way. “You have to be alive. You don’t have to be serious every time. There is need for humour,” he says. 2. VLOGGER Video blogging, or vlogging in short, is what Mr Wilson Muirania, popularly known as Jaymo Ule Msee, identifies as his launch pad to success. You might have seen him on KCB Bank advertisements for their new app or on the Jaymo Ule Msee show on TV. Before the fame, Mr Muirania was a bank relationship officer after graduating with a degree in Political Science and Economics from the University of Nairobi in 2008. But that didn’t excite him. “When I told my parents and friends that I had quit, they were puzzled and thought it was the wrong move, but I knew what I wanted,” he says. In theory, anyone with a camera, an Internet connection and something to say can create a video blog. But for him, vlogging is a career. His YouTube page has over two million views and his Facebook page had 172,244 followers by Friday. It is through these platforms that he broadcasts short videos that tell stories about every day life in a hilarious way. “Social media provides a space for everyone to experiment or do things that we feared doing before,” he says. “For me, using social media to market my talent was, and is, my strategy.” Other famous vloggers include Uganda’s Anne Kansiime who also ended up having a show on TV after her satirical videos impressed media houses. Although vlogging is making its baby steps in Kenya, in Western countries it has become a full-time career for some. According to Forbes, Swedish comedian Felix Kjellberg alias PewDiePie, who made a name from uploading YouTube videos of himself playing video games, earned $7.4 million (Sh740 million) last year from product endorsements. 3. DIGITAL STRATEGIST If you thought the people who set trends on Twitter and have tens of thousands of followers are idlers, better think again because some youths have flown to riches through that medium. One of those is Mr Rama Oluoch, known as Ramzzy on Twitter, currently working as a creative digital strategist at a Nairobi-based marketing firm — his third employer since 2011. With more than 48,600 “followers” on Twitter, Mr Oluoch has been involved in online campaigns for a number of products including beer brands, telecommunication companies and insurance firms. “When someone is launching a product or when there is somebody who already has a product and they’re looking for a professional, that’s when I get to talk to people,” he says. Mr Oluoch considers himself a creative person, an attribute he says has helped him prosper, in addition to his training as a graphic designer. “It’s a rewarding job. I say if you chase happiness, money will come. I chase happiness,” he says. The setback is that many people don’t still understand what he does. “You look unemployed most of the time,” he says, laughing. “You just stay online and you look like a ‘hustler’. Many don’t understand because it is a very young industry.” To succeed in the field, he says, one needs to be interesting and needs to have a considerable following on social media. “When you can grow yourself as a person online, it’s much easier for you to grow a brand because you understand how to communicate with people,” he says. 4. SEO CONSULTANT Do you know why one website appears before another whenever you key in some words on a search engine? A lot of things go into determining which site gets listed first, and you can earn a pretty penny advising website owners on how to make their portals rank higher than their competitors. The method of increasing a website’s reputation on search engines is called Search Engine Optimisation (SEO) and it has provided employment opportunities in the last few years. Mr Ken Kariuki, who runs SEO Consulting Kenya, says he can never return to formal employment since he quit his job at a Nairobi-based technology company seven years ago. When a client hires his company, they analyse the components of the customer’s website to check if it meets Google’s requirements. If met, the website is likely to be ranked higher. “To put it in layman’s terms, Google has a sort of a checklist that they use ... They have got a running algorithm which they keep changing every other day,” he says. Throughout the years he has been engaging in SEO, he has served at least 60 clients. Every contract lasts a minimum of three months. Mr Kariuki says he was the one who created the Administration Police website and its social media outlets. “I was with them for about three years. Now they’re good enough to run it by themselves,” he says. To those aspiring to join his field, he says: “First, get the necessary skills and experience ... SEO is about experience. It’s not as easy as people say.” However, according to Mr Anyona, the Google relationship manager, some practitioners in the SEO field trick customers that they can improve the rank of their websites but flout Google rules in the process. “We’re very open about what goes into [ranking search results] … But there are also those sort of black-hat SEO experts … who try all these dirty tactics of trying to fool Google into ranking the page higher,” Mr Anyona says. 5. VIRTUAL ASSISTANT How about clicking that button to hire a personal assistant who will sort all your stuff for the day? If you think that is impossible, Mr Duncan Kipng’eno will tell you it is possible. He is the founder of Virtual Assistant Kenya, a company that helps people in need of an extra hand in creating a website, preparing account statements, graphic designing, personal assistant services, running errands among others. “You can hire a virtual assistant as your personal assistant. If you’re very busy as a manager, you can say, ‘Let me hire a PA who I can use to help me arrange for meetings, booking appointments and doing some shopping’,” he says. He started his company in April 2013 and since then he has offered virtual assistance to a number of clients worldwide. He currently has 11 people working under him and who specialise in various fields to meet clients’ diverse needs. “We have work from within the country and from other parts of the world — like we’ve had clients from US, UK, China,” he says. Mr Kipng’eno predicts that the demand for virtual assistants in Kenya will keep rising, given the cost-effectiveness the model offers small businesses. “We give small and medium-sized enterprises an opportunity to get the skills and to get services that could have otherwise been provided by employees at an affordable price and in an efficient way,” he says. Clients are charged differently for the services they seek from Mr Kipng’eno’s firm. “We charge Sh300 to Sh500 per hour depending on the task,” he says. 6. BLOGGER Blogging was non-existent in Kenya as recently as 10 years ago. But it has turned out to be one of the most sought-after careers with political parties, corporates and even the government turning to bloggers whenever they want to get a message out. In one of her posts where she replies a follower on what someone needs to do to become a fashion blogger, Silvia Njoki urges commitment. “Fashion blogging can be a full-time job or a hobby. So, depending on your vision, make sure you are committed to spend a lot of time and effort to produce the best possible content for your blog because passion should be your driving force,” she says. One of the ways bloggers make money is by allowing Google to place advertisements on their sites. They get paid when readers click on the ads. To become successful, Ms Njoki says you have to research and be knowledgeable so that people have a reason to visit your blog. Some of Kenya’s renowned bloggers include Sharon Mundia who runs This is Ess, Magunga Williams who runs This is Magunga and Sylvia Jemutai with Dine With Jemutai. 7. YOUTUBER Until you understand the art of running a channel on popular video website YouTube, you may not consider “YouTuber” as one of the emerging professions. But when make-up artist Kangai Mwiti explains how it has enabled her go places and reap profits, it starts to make sense. She started her YouTube channel Kangai Mwiti in May 2012 and by Friday, it had more than 96,300 subscribers, most of whom are there to learn how to apply makeup. “It took me eight months to get to 100 subscribers,” recalls Ms Mwiti, a graduate of international business and marketing from the United States International University. Ms Mwiti won hearts gradually, giving her channel the traction that opened doors for income when she became a brand. “It has expanded the work that I do to include so many other things apart from makeup,” she says. Now she has integrated the channel with social media platforms, which ensures a steady supply of clients in need of makeup. “Eighty per cent of my clients come from what they have seen online first then the others possibly come from referrals,” she says. She has lost count of the number of clients she has had ever since she gained fame online. “I have so many brides that I work with, I have makeover clients, I have corporates … For example, from July to August I’ve worked with an average of three to four weddings every week,” she says. For aspiring YouTubers, she urges persistence, consistency and creativity. 8. ONLINE SUPPORT CHAMPION Consumers now have the social media as the go-to place whenever they have complaints against sellers, and corporates are now employing people to enable them interact with clients. Ms Njeri Igane, for instance, works as an online support champion with Safaricom. When she reports for work in her 4 pm to 1 am shift, she checks which skill set she has been assigned for the day — mostly Facebook or Twitter — then responds to questions from subscribers. Sometimes she calls the customers. The number of queries they receive on online platforms, she says, is almost similar to those from direct callers. “On the weekends, it tends to die down because a lot of people who engage us on social media are the youths … so we have even less numbers of agents working over the weekend compared to the rest of the week,” she says. 9. APP DEVELOPER One-and-a-half decades after the cell phone came to Kenya, 85 per cent of the population now owns phones, according to the Communications Authority.  More recently, smartphones have gained prominence, creating an avenue for mobile application developers to create Kenyan-made apps, some of which have ended up being viable businesses. Entertainment applications have in particular become a hit, with developers creating apps like Tough Jungle, a gaming application created by Gerald Kibugi about a Maasai warrior who faces challenges in a forest. “At the time I came up with Tough Jungle, I realised that there have been no games based on the Kenyan setting apart from Ma3 Racer,” he says. Ma3 Racer, an app about driving a matatu on the streets of Nairobi, is perhaps the most successful — with over two million downloads. The phenomenal growth of this industry is the reason why Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg’s first stop in his recent Kenya visit was at iHub along Ngong Road, an incubation centre where app developers are guided to make money from their creations. 10. 3D SCULPTOR Also known as addictive manufacturing, 3D printing enables one to design and synthesise a three-dimensional object through a computer. Tangible objects of any shape or geometry can be produced by using Computer Aided Design software and although the adoption of this technology has been slow in Kenya, a number of 3D sculptors have sprung up. In 2013, Roy Ombati and Harris Nyali from the University of Nairobi, took part in the Innovation Africa competition on 3D printing through their project “Happy Feet” that aimed to assist people whose feet have been infested by jiggers with customized 3D printed shoes. It’s not just shoes, 3D printing can be applied in architecture, construction, industrial design, automotive, aerospace, military, engineering, medicine, biotechnology, fashion, education, geographic information systems and food industries.     email print In the headlines Race for IEBC top job narrows down to five - VIDEO The panel has the delicate task of negotiating the tricky political and ethnic lines in its Investigators put on the spot in NYS scam Tobiko, anti-graft team and criminal investigator under fire for shoddy probe on loss of funds.

Is Google gearing up for a clash with ride-hailing giant Uber? It may be, according to a Wall Street Journal report this past week. The Journal reported that Google has begun rolling out a service that offers an alternative to Uber's ride-hailing—without the need for dedicated professional drivers.  Try Newsweek for only $1.25 per week Google, a unit of Alphabet, has been running a pilot program since May that allows some users of its Waze route-planning app to connect with fellow commuters to share rides. Right now, the pilot program is limited to employees at a few companies in Silicon Valley, but Google plans to open the program to all San Francisco-area users of the Waze app this fall, according to the report.  Google may have plans to undercut Uber with its Waze route-planning app. Reuters While riders are paying fares, and drivers are being paid, the structure of the pilot program seems intended to discourage people from operating as full-time drivers, as they would with Uber or rival Lyft. The idea is that Waze will connect riders with drivers who are already headed in the same direction, making it simple for the driver to take them along. Riders are limited to two rides a day—to work and back, ideally.  Under the pilot program, riders pay no more than $0.54 cents a mile. It's probably no coincidence that's the Internal Revenue Service's current standard mileage allowance rate. The idea seems to be to give drivers a small cash incentive to pick up passengers, without asking them to go far out of their way to do so.  What does this program tell us about Google's likely plans? And what does it mean for Uber?   At least at the moment, Waze-enabled ride-sharing doesn't seem likely to put a big dent in Uber, even if it's rolled out to all Waze users across the country. Waze (and this new service) are structured around commuting, rather than the taxi-like short urban hops that are Uber's bread and butter.  Related Stories Waze Misleads IDF Troops to Clashes at Palestinian Camp Uber Plans to Launch Self-Driving Cars ‘Within Weeks’ Uber Plans to Map the World But it's another signal that Google is feeling its way into the business of personal mobility. Google has been working for years on a self-driving system for cars, but more recently seemed to have ruled out the idea of manufacturing cars itself. That left the obvious question—how would Google monetize its investment in self-driving technology?—with a somewhat obvious answer: By horning in on Uber's turf, somehow. This seems likely to be a move in that direction. Adding to the intrigue: Google Ventures was an early investor in Uber, but its board representative, Alphabet executive David Drummond, recently resigned from Uber's board.  If automated ride-hailing services take off as some analysts predict, Google seems well positioned to end up as a dominant player—if it decides to make the commitment to become one. That would put it in direct competition with Uber, a possibility that Uber CEO Travis Kalanick has seen coming for a while. He told Bloomberg last month that worries about Google emerging as a competitor (rather than an ally) were what drove his decision to invest in a separate self-driving research program.  Who will prevail if the two end up battling? On the one hand, Google has Alphabet's massive corporate scale and resources, though it's not clear that Alphabet will be willing to spend on the scale that would be needed to buy (or build) and equip thousands of self-driving cars.  On the other hand, Uber has a big head start on addressing the extremely complicated software problem of routing its cars most efficiently. That's perhaps its most valuable advantage.  Request Reprint or Submit Correction Join the Discussion Most Read © 2016 Newsweek LLC Please enter a valid email About Us Corrections Contact Us IBT Media Careers Advertise Copyright Privacy Policy Terms of Service Terms of Sale Archive Recent Issues Subscribe November 11 Issue Budweiser's Battle for Beer Market Dominance The Hacker’s Pearl Harbor The Cow Defense October 28 Issue Colorado Springs Teens Keep Killing Themselves Experts Suspect New Dead Sea Scroll Fragments Are Fake Donald the Destroyer October 21 Issue Swipe for Safer Sex Roosh V: From Pickup Artist to Right-Wing Provocateur The New ISIS Crisis October 14 Issue How the Chicago Marathon Will Keep Track of Millions The Black Panthers, 50 Years Later Trump Foundation Ordered to Halt Fundraising Browse Archives

In an attempt to change this, Google has released the Pixel C tablet (along with a choice of expensive keyboard covers), which it hopes will paint the Android tablet experience in a whole new light. But are they successful in this, or is the whole idea just academic in a world with affordable Windows 10 tablets Acer Switch Alpha 12 Hybrid Tablet Review and Giveaway Acer Switch Alpha 12 Hybrid Tablet Review and Giveaway Looking for a better priced Surface Pro 4?

Google Pixel C Giveaway Me and the Android Tablet I’m proud to report that the Android tablet scene was one of the few times I’ve ever had my finger on the pulse (I don’t count using a smartphone from 2003-2008 because, well, it was a Windows Mobile device). Back in 2010, when the first Android tablets were released, I headed to my local electronics store and bought an Advent Vega tablet (also known as the P10AN01), rooted it, and discarded the version of Froyo that game pre-installed. I then installed a custom Android Honeycomb ROM called VegaComb. Ads by Google Despite the low cost of the device, it was reasonably good, but struggled with certain tasks (such as audio processing), where the iPad would shine. This was partly down to the operating system, as well as the architecture. But why do I mention the Advent Vega in particular? Well, it’s because the processor on that device was a dual core Tegra 2. The Pixel C also features a Tegra processor, this time the octa-core Tegra X1. But how does this measure up? Pixel C Hardware Specifications Six years is a long time in technology. Google’s Pixel C tablet takes a powerful Tegra X1 system-on-chip processor with 3 GB of RAM (32 GB or 64 GB of non-expandable storage is included, depending on the price point) and produces what is perhaps the best Tegra-powered tablet outside of NVidia’s gamer-centric Shield range NVIDIA Shield TV Review and Giveaway NVIDIA Shield TV Review and Giveaway The proposition is simple: Pack some of today’s best performing mobile hardware into a sandwich shaped box – for streaming video and media, and playing mobile games. That’s why you need to pay $200-300. Read More . The processor uses the curiously named ARM big.LITTLE architecture, which means that four of the eight cores are slower and power efficient, while the other four are faster and more powerful. This allows for more efficient battery usage when performing simple tasks like web browsing, with the ability to ramp up for more demanding task like gaming. The 10.2 inch, backlit LTPS IPS LCD display, runs at 308 ppi (density 2560 x 1800), and is powered by the 256-core Maxwell GPU. Weighing in at 18.2 oz (517 g), the 9.53 x 7.05 x 0.28-inch (242x179x7 mm device sits comfortably in the hand in either orientation, and the narrow bezel enhances the idea of the tablet as an iPad-beater. Over time it can be tricky to hold, however, partly due to the sleek quality of the build. The Pixel C comes with all of the usual cameras (8 MP rear, 2 MP front), audio (3.5 mm combo headphone/microphone jack, dual side-facing speakers) and connectivity options (WiFi, Bluetooth). NFC is conspicuous by its absence, as is a 4G variant of the Pixel C, which would no doubt see the tablet do well with the mobile networks. Where Is the Pixel C? This does seem to be a bit of a problem for Google’s flagship Android tablet, the successor to the Nexus tablets, at least for now. Unless you’re buying online from Google Play or Amazon, or from big name retailers, you’re not going to see much of it. Similarly, it has been largely absent from TV and magazine advertising, a sure-fire means of getting your product seen. Given the sheer chasm in quality and performance between the Pixel C and tablets from rival Samsung, this is lunacy. But most importantly, I feel, is the lack of partner deals with smartphone retailers. A 4G version of the Pixel C was touted early on, but this has failed to materialize. Is it a Tablet, a Laptop, or a “Laplet”? Yes, I really did just say “laplet” — it’s a terrible concatenation of “laptop” and “tablet” — and while it tries desperately to describe a device like the Pixel C (or perhaps Microsoft Surface Pro 4, or Apple iPad Pro) all it does really is trivialize the fact that this is a powerful, versatile tablet. The Google Pixel C is not a laplet. Not really. It most certainly isn’t a laptop — it feels and operates like a tablet. It doesn’t come with a mouse or touchpad (although Bluetooth devices can be added 6 Top Uses For Bluetooth On Your Android Phone 6 Top Uses For Bluetooth On Your Android Phone Bluetooth has been an impressive wireless technology to enable all sorts of cool functionality with multiple gadgets. While it was rather limited during the early stages of its life, Bluetooth has evolved to be capable... Read More ), an optical drive or even a card reader. None of the things you would expect from a laptop are included, and placing the device on your actual lap is clumsy and unwieldy. So the Google Pixel C is definitely a tablet. But how is it to use? The Pixel C Keyboard Both of Google’s approved keyboard options for the Pixel C will set you back over $100. The one we’re featuring in this review and giveaway is a folio option that features a useful magnetic strip to keep the tablet in place. While there’s no “choose your own angle” adjustable stand as with the Surface Pro 4, it does offer two viewing angles, which is obviously better than just one. This keyboard will wrap around behind the Pixel C to allow its use in portrait mode, and actually makes the tablet easier to hold. I’d like to say that the keyboard is good enough for me to have written this entire review on. But circumstances happen; as a result, some of it was written on the Google Pixel C (along with several other complete posts, such as my look at Android Trojan infections How to Avoid Downloading Trojans to Your Android Device How to Avoid Downloading Trojans to Your Android Device Trojan attacks are sneaky because they can steal your personal details and sensitive data without you even realizing it. Here's how to avoid Trojan infections on Android devices. Read More ). If you’re buying a Pixel C, you may prefer to buy the tablet and couple it with your own Bluetooth keyboard. Whatever your solution, we’d recommend some sort of folio case regardless, as the Pixel C isn’t easy to grip. Working With the Google Pixel C One of the key selling points for the Google Pixel C is that it is a production tablet. Attach a keyboard it really does work like a compact ultrabook, much like Apple’s iPad Pro Powerful Things, Small Packages: iPad Pro 9.7" Review Powerful Things, Small Packages: iPad Pro 9.7" Review For some people, a 12.9" screen is the main draw of Apple's first iPad Pro.

We've got your back. Read More , it’s bound to deliver even more of a productive desktop experience. But, as you should be aware, so many creative and productive apps are now available for Android. A device like the Pixel C is perfect for taking advantage of these tools and getting down to business. An Expensive Kindle Replacement? Of course, all of this depends really on what sort of experience you want from your Android tablet. For instance, I usually use a Samsung 10-inch tablet, but even with a custom ROM installed this is a clunky experience, best for enjoying things like Comixology, Readly and Kindle, rather than doing any real work. If this is how you typically use a tablet, you might find that the Pixel C is a slightly expensive option. After all, these apps are available and run sufficiently well on nearly any device you can get hold of these days. Spending the best part of $600 on Google’s flagship tablet and accompanying keyboard, simply to enjoy the same reading experience with a slightly better display, seems excessive. On the other hand, if you want to read and research as well as be productive, the Pixel C is perfect. Consuming and Producing Multimedia Photo editing, video editing, even podcasting, are all tasks you can perform on the Pixel C. While this is not unusual for Android devices these days, the processor and RAM make these activities particularly slick and enjoyable, without the typical lag associated with older devices and Android versions. Enjoying games, photos, streamed video and music and any other content you can think of is similarly impressive. The color reproduction of the 10.2-inch LCD display is superb, with a richness to games and videos, a crispness to photos. In short, the Pixel C brings iPad-levels of competence to mobile media production and enjoyment. This is a significant step in the story of Android; it’s taken a while to reach this point, but we’re finally there, suggesting that replacing desktop and laptop computers with Android devices seems increasingly likely. It also means… Android’s iPad Killer Has Finally Arrived! While it’s a little heavier than an iPad, the Pixel C feels a little more businesslike, and it certainly has the muscle to provide all but the most ardent power users with all of the tools they need to get the job done. I’ll be honest: I’ve been evaluating this tablet for two months now. It is simply the best I’ve used of this type of device, and I’m very sad to see the back of it.

I've loved my Pixel C from the moment I've had it, and prefer it to the iPad, which I have at work and my wife has. If you get the hard case keyboard instead of the leather backed one, if you have issues with the leather one. I prefer the hard case one. It allows you to hold the device by the keyboard without the worry of dropping it. I believe this is as good if not better than an iPad and is purely down to your OS preference. I prefer Android over iOS. And the only think that makes this more practical than an iPad is the very awesome keyboard. Android N and split screen are just a recent bonus.

Android may be a better OS, but iPad's hardware is better and all the innovative developers develop for iPad. iPad has low latency audio, GarageBand, micro-fluid keyboard case, active stylus with pressure sensitivity and palm rejection, time-synced multimedia notes, and hopefully 3D touch will come soon as well. At the end of the day an Android device is just another smartphone, but iPad is a complete workstation. Reply David September 11, 2016 at 9:32 am Hello ...

Share a story idea here (link opens in a new window) Friday September 9 2016 Scott Anderson / James Militzer / Kyle Poplin Weekly Roundup: A Different Kind of Pivot in SE Asia, a Surprising Collaboration in India and South Africa’s Sweet Move President Barack Obama this week wrapped up his final trip to Asia in his attempt to “pivot” his foreign policy agenda eastward. Although the results of Obama’s trip are in dispute, there’s little debate when it comes to the growing clout of Southeast Asia’s entrepreneurial class – including its bumper crop of social enterprises. It’s a long-term trend that can’t be summed up in a single Roundup post. Nevertheless, it feels like just about every week we hear about a new conference, incubator, accelerator, fund or university program designed to enable startups – from Singapore to the Philippines to Laos. “From our perspective at the National University of Singapore (NUS), we observe a remarkable and growing interest in social entrepreneurship,” wrote associate professors Audrey Chia and Lim Yee Wei last month. “NUS hosts a social venture competition each year. Last year we had 683 entries and this year we have 1,027. The quality of entries has also improved.” In July, 50 “developed social enterprises” and 30 private-public sector partners participated in the first-ever ASEAN Conference on Social Entrepreneurship in Singapore, where they met with and pitched to investors. The finalists will make a final pitch to investors in October in Jakarta. (Singapore also plays host to the BoP World Convention next month.) “One of the main reasons why social innovation and entrepreneurship is flourishing is because many old policies and ways of working cannot solve some of today’s most pressing global issues. It requires truly novel solutions,” Jean Tan, executive director of Singapore International Foundation, said in a press release. Krisztina Tora, who leads the Global Social Entrepreneurship Network, which supports early-stage social entrepreneurs, recently wrote about the gelling of many social business groups in the region and some of the deep-seated cultural issues social entrepreneurs often face: “There (is) general agreement that talent is a major barrier for social entrepreneurs and their supporters. This is especially true in Asia where there is societal and parental pressure to have a ‘successful career’ (i.e. a traditional/conservative vision of what professional success looks like) and therefore entrepreneurship is seen as a sort of failure or a last resort choice.” And as Sankalp Forum pointed out in its e-newsletter this week: “Despite facing the typical challenges of operating in an emerging market, what is interesting in the Filipino ecosystem is the number of startups that are focusing on social impact, and the creative solution of the government for increasing the impact of SMEs: GoNegosyo. Corporations are playing their part as well, backing social enterprises as a means to achieve the SDGs.” Is this an anecdotal list? Absolutely. And comparing one region’s social enterprise prowess to another is risky business. But considering the burst of activity across Southeast Asia, it’s everyone’s business to pay a bit more attention.  – By Scott Anderson Truth Tweet In Development, It’s Not the First Time in History that it has been the First Time in History pic.twitter.com/5oc67DhJwN — William Easterly (@bill_easterly) September 9, 2016   Can Google Boost India’s Financial Literacy? India’s financial inclusion drive has scored some impressive successes – including bringing some 77 million women into the formal banking system in just one year. But the outlook isn’t entirely rosy: Almost 76 percent of Indian adults lack an adequate understanding of key financial concepts, according to a recent survey, and the country’s household savings rate has fallen significantly. To address these issues, the government is apparently turning, in part, to Google. According to unnamed Google and Indian government representatives quoted in the Economic Times, the tech behemoth is designing a website and mobile app called Bharat Saves, which it hopes to align with the national financial inclusion initiative. The site, which is targeted at homemakers, small business owners, the newly employed, retired persons and farmers, will reportedly include two phases. First, users must log in, complete financial literacy modules, and take a financial literacy test. Then they will be able to access a second section of the platform, where they can compare and purchase banking and insurance products. Since this is Google we’re talking about, it’s hard to avoid concerns about the privacy of low-income users, and how all this detailed data on their financial lives will be put to use. But assuming the government keeps any of Google’s more aggressive data-collecting impulses in check, this could be an exciting collaboration. – By James Militzer   Mixed News for Microfinance The latest quarterly report from India’s Microfinance Institutions Network underscores the sector’s growing momentum in the country. A few highlights: Credit disbursal grew by 29 percent in the April-June period, and loan portfolios have grown 89 percent industry-wide since the first quarter of 2015-16. Microfinance is proving to be an important source of security for the elderly in underprivileged communities, with microfinance institutions (MFIs) seeing their pension accounts grow by 108 percent in the first quarter, compared to the same time last year. On the downside, smaller MFIs seem to be struggling to access capital, with large MFIs receiving over 90 percent of debt funding from banks and other financial institutions this quarter. On a more somber note, new analysis from some prominent researchers points toward some troubling findings for the global industry. According to Bob Cull, Asli Demirguc-Kunt and Jonathan Morduch, the industry remains largely dependent on subsidies – including most for-profit MFIs. What’s more, “dependence on subsidies declines but does not disappear as institutions become older,” and those subsidies often aren’t focused on expanding access to those who might benefit most from them, including poorer customers and women. The research was based on data from 930 microfinance institutions with some 80 million combined customers. One intriguing takeaway: The findings “underline the importance of pursuing new ways to change the cost structure faced by most microfinance institutions such as digital payments and mobile money.” – By James Militzer   ImpInv report Just launched: Latin American #impinv report w/ @lavca_org & @LGT_IV!

Not just because they invented a badly needed product – the Hemafuse, a low-cost blood transfusion device – but because they’re providing a roadmap on how to commercialize it.  From their thoughtful, inclusive design phase through their funding efforts, the three women behind Sisu (including two graduates from the University of Michigan, NextBillion’s stomping ground) have taken carefully measured steps in pursuit of their passion. This week, they announced that they’ve reached 80 percent of the goal in their $1 million seed round, recently netting $500,000 from the Camden Partners Exelixis Fund – the first investment made by the new fund focused on growing companies in Maryland. Meanwhile, they’re beginning clinical studies of the Hemafuse in Ethiopia.  If your goal is to solve a global health problem with technology, you’d do well to read up on Sisu. If you do, be prepared to be impressed. – By Kyle Poplin South Africa’s sweet move South Africa’s Department of Health explained this week why, starting in 2017, it will become the first African country to charge a tax on sugar-sweetened beverages. Bottom line: People there are fat and getting fatter, and obesity is overall bad for business. It’s clear that free markets can solve problems, but market tweaks from government, such as “sin taxes,” can modify behaviors and save lives while easing skyrocketing health care burdens on specific economies. South Africa is an appropriate place to try the tax. One in four South Africans are obese and one in five consume an excessive amount of sugar – 17 teaspoons per day, on average, almost double WHO’s recommended amount. But it’s clear that excessive sugar consumption is a global problem. The average Mexican, for example, consumes 35 teaspoons per day. That led Mexico to impose a tax similar to South Africa’s, and it’s “been relatively effective in reducing the consumption of sugary beverages,” tax expert Kyle Mandy told the BBC. South African officials should, of course, monitor the tax after implementation to weigh its benefits and costs, but in the meantime they should be applauded for being the first on their continent to take this particular step in the battle against non-communicable diseases. – By Kyle Poplin IN CASE YOU MISSED IT … THIS WEEK ON NEXTBILLION Finding the Right Last-Mile Distribution Model Stopping the Spread of ‘Superbugs’: Six Promising Solutions What We’re Learning Every Step of the Energy Ladder The Volatile ‘Face’ of Digital Financial Services in Zambia   Photo by John Ragai via Flickr.

Let's examine a handful of his most insightful quotes about the future of Google, his sprawling set of Other Bets, leadership, and more. Andrew Tonner (TMFTheDude) Sep 10, 2016 at 10:21AM Image source: Getty Images. Larry Page is the co-founder and CEO of Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), the holding company for Google and the diverse menagerie of Other Bets the company has more recently spawned. He's also the 11th richest person on Earth and an avid kiteboarder, both of which I discovered by asking the search engine his company created.  Having accomplished so much by the tender age of 43, it's safe to say Larry Page stands as one of the most powerful and influential figures in business today. Let's examine a few interesting quotes from the Alphabet co-founder on a wide range of subjects. Larry Page on business and technology Many of us think of Larry Page, his co-founder Sergey Brin, and Alphabet's longtime third-in-command Eric Schmidt as genius inventors, and that's certainly true -- to an extent. Each member of Alphabet's famous triumvirate is a talented computer scientist, to be sure. However, Page will also be the first to admit that Alphabet's overwhelming success didn't come from inventing the search engine, but rather from bringing this technology to the masses: Invention is not enough. Tesla invented the electric power we use, but he struggled to get it out to people. You have to combine both things: invention and innovation focus, plus the company that can commercialize things and get them to people.  In the years since its founding, Alphabet has developed an incredibly diverse suite of products. And though advertising from a few core products still generates the bulk of its sales, it's clear that Page sees his company's broader mission as less tethered to any one product as it is simply creating great technology: We want to build technology that everybody loves using, and that affects everyone. We want to create beautiful, intuitive services and technologies that are so incredibly useful that people use them twice a day. Like they use a toothbrush. There aren't that many things people use twice a day.  One of the most defining characteristics of the technology industry, perhaps more so than most industries, is its propensity for constant change. Continually thriving in this environment requires constant reinvention and an eye to the future. Here's how Page frames this business challenge in his own words: Lots of companies don't succeed over time. What do they fundamentally do wrong? They usually miss the future. I try to focus on that: What is the future really going to be? And how do we create it? And how do we power our organization to really focus on that and really drive it at a high rate?  Without question, one of the areas of greatest interest in tech today lies in AI, or artificial intelligence, an area of clear longtime interest for Page. In fact, this quote from all the way back in 2000 shows just how long Page and his counterparts at Alphabet have been thinking about this topic, which only recently became the tech topic de jour: Artificial intelligence would be the ultimate version of Google. So we have the ultimate search engine that would understand everything on the Web. It would understand exactly what you wanted, and it would give you the right thing. That's obviously artificial intelligence, to be able to answer any question, basically, because almost everything is on the Web, right? We're nowhere near doing that now. However, we can get incrementally closer to that, and that is basically what we work on. And that's tremendously interesting from an intellectual standpoint.  Larry Page on leadership and life Like many business moguls, Page is often sought out for insight on topics beyond technology and business. As the man tasked with guiding a global organization, Page knows something of leadership as well. Here's how the billionaire articulates his thinking on the matter: My job as a leader is to make sure everybody in the company has great opportunities, and that they feel they're having a meaningful impact and are contributing to the good of society. As a world, we're doing a better job of that. My goal is for Google to lead, not follow that.  Though some argue it has waned as its size has increased, Alphabet also gained acclaim thanks to its unique corporate culture. In fact, the company served as the poster child for tech's corporate culture, and it's clear that its more open and casual ethos came from the top down, as Page once said: It's important that the company be a family, that people feel that they're part of the company, and that the company is like a family to them. When you treat people that way, you get better productivity.  However, despite Alphabet's overwhelming success and bullish outlook, it's clear that Page's motivation to co-found the company lay outside the possible fame and fortune it eventually wrought. To a surprising degree, this somewhat counterintuitive sentiment appears as a common thread throughout the careers of many of business' most successful leaders. Page nicely summarized his own attitudes toward material pursuits in the following way: If we were motivated by money, we would have sold the company a long time ago and ended up on a beach.  Changing the world requires a unique -- some might say lucky -- mix of timing and ability, and Page clearly fits the bill in both regards. The man helped create one of the most powerful technology companies the world has ever known, and he's likely just getting started. Especially with presumably so much time left to further Alphabet's ambitions, it will be fascinating to see what the road ahead holds for one of the digital age's most renowned names.

Huffington wants to sell your boss on office naps Rebecca Greenfield, Bloomberg 9:06 a.m. EDT September 10, 2016 Arianna Huffington (Photo: Evan Agostini, Associated Press) CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Weeks after leaving her eponymous news website to launch a corporate wellness service called Thrive, Arianna Huffington has hired former New York Times and Google executives for the new venture, aiming to teach companies to "treat the whole human being." As it enters the crowded workplace wellness industry, with its quit-smoking incentives and step challenges, Thrive intends to go beyond the usual offerings to focus on "the mental aspects of our lives, what's happening in our heads," Huffington said in an interview. "This is all something that you bring to work," she added. Huffington spent more than a decade running the Huffington Post, which she founded in 2005, but over the years her interest shifted from news to the pursuit of elusive work-life balance. In the last two years, she has published two books - "Thrive: The Third Metric to Redefining Success and "Creating a Life of Well-Being, Wisdom, and Wonder" and the nap-at-work manifesto "The Sleep Revolution" - full of theories she's now spinning into her new business. Last month, she announced she was leaving her namesake site to pursue her latest venture. Thrive will officially launch Nov. 30, Huffington said. In the meantime, the company is staffing up: Rajiv Pant, a former chief technology officer at the New York Times, has come on as CTO, and Kathryn Friedrich, who spent the better part of a decade at Google and YouTube, will join next month as chief marketing officer. Both said Huffington's plea for a more humane work-life balance drew them to the organization. "I was truly stressed out. This is something I personally connected with," said Pant. "If you look at my tweets, they're about behavior, getting enough sleep. This is the right company." Friedrich thinks Thrive can create a more positive work-life experience than even Google, considered an Eden of workplace culture. "Google tries to create a good existence for their employees. They do a fantastic job," she said. "The one thing that might be missing that Arianna wants to bring to the table are metrics. It's one thing to put all the offerings out there. It's another thing to measure the success of those things." (Google is known for studying its company culture's effects on employees' productivity and happiness.) At its core, Thrive is a corporate wellness consultancy: Companies pay Thrive-trained coaches to bestow health and wellness tips on their overworked and underperforming staffs. They can opt for online courses or in-person trainings, with sessions ranging from a couple of hours to six weeks. Huffington said that the consulting firm Accenture has already piloted trainings and that JPMorgan Chase has also signed on for a partnership. DELAWAREONLINE Missing information halts Europe's review of DuPont deal DELAWAREONLINE 10 of fall's fun events - starting with 3 this weekend In addition to its courses, Thrive will also have a media arm, as Bloomberg reported in June. Huffington has previously said Thrive is not a media company but said in an interview that it will have "a consumer platform attached to the corporate platform that will be constantly reinforcing our message." Much like the Huffington Post, the site will rely on big names, like athletes and experts, for its content. It will also sell wellness-related products like pillows and food supplements, and Huffington hopes it will eventually become a discussion platform open to the public - something the company is working on with Medium, she said. The sell? All of this, in theory, services Thrive's clients' bottom lines. But with its entry into the corporate wellness industry, which market research firm IBISWorld values at $6 billion, Thrive is competing within an already crowded space. And Huffington - who champions digital detoxing, office napping and actually unplugging on vacation - is not alone in pushing mindfulness on companies. Many other wellness companies address both body and mind, too, offering office fitness alongside meditation. Corporate wellness budgets have ballooned as companies try to curb health insurance costs, since a healthier workforce means lower insurance costs and higher productivity. But a much-cited RAND Corporation study has called many such wellness offerings into question, finding that for all the money poured into them, they save little on health care: For every $1 spent on "lifestyle management" programs - like smoking cessation and weight-loss initiatives - companies saved just 50 cents, the study found. Huffington is confident Thrive's holistic approach will yield better results for both clients and workers, saying the Rand study "really didn't address things like stress and burnout." Thrive, she said, will rely only on "evidence-based" methods for its courses; it has hired Adam Grant, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, to study its work with Accenture. "As we get more evidence, we will be adopting and adjusting everything we are doing," said Huffington. Maybe napping at the office only works during certain times of day? Or maybe meetings are actually better when everyone has a cell phone? For now, in its own SoHo offices, Thrive plans to practice what it preaches. Meetings will be device-free. ("We have beautiful notebooks," said Huffington.) And, yes, there will be a place to nap.

AdMob is a mobile advertising platform from Google that developers can use to generate revenue from apps through in-app advertising. AdMob provides different sets of ads like banner ads, interstitial ads, video ads, or native ads integrated with native UI components. AdMob uses the Google Mobile Ads SDK which helps maximizing revenue and achieve massive scale with Google’s ad solutions. The focus of this article is to integrate AdMob with your apps, but before doing this it’s a good idea to understand the best practices and policies of how to implement ads. I recommend the AdMob YouTube videos for banner ads and interstitial ads. More from this author A Step by Step Guide to Building an Android Audio Player App Tidy and Optimize Your Java Code with Android Butter Knife Getting Started with AdMob First sign up to the AdMob service. Open the AdMob homepage. Click on the Monetize tab. Click on Monetize new app. Select the ad format Banner, Interstitial, Rewarded interstitial, or Native. Fill in the Ad unit name input. You can choose to link your ads to firebase. For this example I skipped this step. You can add different ad formats to your apps. For the sample app I am presenting in this article I created three different ad formats, banner, interstitial and native ads. To add new ad units to an app open the Monetize tab, and select the app. Configuration Create a new Android Project with an empty activity and add the following dependencies to build.gradle (Module: app).     dependencies {
        compile 'com.google.android.gms:play-services:9.4.0'
    }
 In res/values/strings.xml add the ads unit IDs. In my case the IDs look as follows. <!--Ad unit ID-->
<string name="admob_banner_ad">ca-app-pub-3306270630045532/9042995609</string>
<string name="admob_interstitial_ad">ca-app-pub-3306270630045532/1519728802</string>
<string name="admob_native_ad">ca-app-pub-3306270630045532/4473195204</string>
 In AndroidManifest.xml include the required permissions for Google Mobile Ads to run. <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"/>
 Integrating Ads into an Android App The rest of this tutorial consist of three examples on how to integrate the ads you created into an Android app. You can integrate each of the examples into a standalone app, but in the GitHub repository for this project, I added the ads as different fragments and the process is similar. Banner Ads In this section I will focus on adding banner ads and event handling. Adding banner ads to an Android project is the easiest option, compared with the process of integrating other ad types. Choose an appropriate place in a layout file and add the following code snippet, for example an Activity‘s layout file. <com.google.android.gms.ads.AdView
    android:id="@+id/adView"
    android:layout_width="wrap_content"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
    android:layout_centerHorizontal="true"
    ads:adSize="SMART_BANNER"
    ads:adUnitId="@string/admob_banner_ad">
</com.google.android.gms.ads.AdView>
 I specified the ad size as SMART_BANNER which sets the width of the banner to match the screen size, but AdMob has multiple sizes available. Read the documentation for more. Make sure to add the name-space used for ads in the container Layout of the layout file: <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<RelativeLayout xmlns:ads="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto">
  ...
  <com.google.android.gms.ads.AdView>
    ...
  </com.google.android.gms.ads.AdView>
</RelativeLayout>
 Now you have added the AdView to the layout file you must load content into it. In the Activity class which will display the ad, create the following global instance. private AdView adView;
 In the Activity onCreate() method add the following code snippet. // Initialize the Mobile Ads SDK.
MobileAds.initialize(this, getResources().getString(R.string.admob_banner_ad));
adView = (AdView) findViewById(R.id.adView);
AdRequest adRequest = new AdRequest.Builder()
        .build();
adView.loadAd(adRequest);
 When testing ads during development it’s recommended that you specify AdRequest as a test device. For this tutorial I have not specified any test device. AdRequest adRequest = new AdRequest.Builder()
    .addTestDevice("DEVICE ID")
    .build();
 An important part of managing ads are the Activity‘s lifecycle methods, so add the following methods to the MainActivity class. @Override
public void onPause() {
  super.onPause();
  if (adView != null) adView.pause();
}

@Override
public void onResume() {
  super.onResume();
  if (adView != null) adView.resume();
}

@Override
public void onDestroy() {
  super.onDestroy();
  if (adView != null) adView.destroy();
}
 Run the Android project and take a look at your cool ads. Ad Events Another important part of managing ads are lifecycle events. The list of ad events includes events like loading, opening, closing, failed to load and AdLeftApplication. You can chose to listen for any of the lifecycle events, in the following code I setup listeners for all possible events in onCreate. adView.setAdListener(new AdListener() {
  @Override
  public void onAdClosed() {
      super.onAdClosed();
      //user returns to the app after tapping on an ad.
  }

  @Override
  public void onAdFailedToLoad(int i) {
      super.onAdFailedToLoad(i);
      //Ad request fails.
  }

  @Override
  public void onAdLeftApplication() {
      super.onAdLeftApplication();
      //User left the app.
  }

  @Override
  public void onAdOpened() {
      super.onAdOpened();
      //Ad displayed on the screen.
  }

  @Override
  public void onAdLoaded() {
      super.onAdLoaded();
      //Ad finishes loading.
  }
});
 These events work both for banner and interstitial ads. Interstitial Ads Interstitial are full-screen ads that cover the full interface of the app. As the name suggests, the full-screen nature of this ads blocks the ability for the user to interact with the interface of the app so you should be careful when displaying interstitial ads. A good way do display them is at app’s transition points and it’s not a good idea to show this kind of ad frequently. Interstitials do not have a layout to load them, you load them in java code. Create a global instance for the interstitial add in MainActivity. private InterstitialAd interstitialAd;
 To show a interstitial ad, call the following function. private void loadInterstitialAd() {
  interstitialAd = new InterstitialAd(this);
  interstitialAd.setAdUnitId(getResources().getString(R.string.admob_interstitial_ad));
  AdRequest adRequest = new AdRequest.Builder()
          .build();
  interstitialAd.loadAd(adRequest);
  interstitialAd.setAdListener(new AdListener() {
      @Override
      public void onAdLoaded() {
          super.onAdLoaded();
          interstitialAd.show();
      }
  });
}
 Keep in mind that interstitial ads use a lot of bandwidth and need time to load, so it’s important to show them after the loading process is complete. You can use the lifecycle events I showed earlier with interstitials to listen to certain ad events. Native Ads Native ads are a great way to customize ads to fit apps contents. Native Ads are CSS templates of the ad view. AdMob provides two different ways to implement native ads, Native Ads Express and Native Ads Advanced. Native Ads Express are CSS templates created in the AdMob panel based on predefined view and ad templates. For developers who want full control over ad presentation, AdMob provides Native Ads Advanced. In the following example of Native Ads, I will work with Express Ads. The process of adding native ads in an Android project is similar to banner ads so the main focus of the following section is to build a RecyclerView with native ads included as of its items. Building a RecyclerView requires a RecyclerView.Adapter, a RecyclerView.ViewHolder and a layout file for the RecyclerView items. It’s a good idea to have this item layout to look like with the Native Ads layout to make the ads integrate nicely with the rest of the app. For my example, the following layout will do. Create res/layout/item_layout.xml and add the following. <LinearLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="100dp"
    android:orientation="horizontal">

    <ImageView
        android:layout_width="80dp"
        android:layout_height="80dp"
        android:layout_marginBottom="8dp"
        android:layout_marginTop="15dp"
        android:src="@android:drawable/ic_menu_gallery" />

    <LinearLayout
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="match_parent"
        android:layout_marginTop="25dp"
        android:orientation="vertical">

        <TextView
            android:id="@+id/itemTitle"
            android:layout_width="match_parent"
            android:layout_height="wrap_content"
            android:layout_gravity="center_horizontal"
            android:layout_marginBottom="4dp"
            android:text="RecyclerView Item"
            android:textAppearance="?android:attr/textAppearanceLarge" />

        <TextView
            android:id="@+id/itemDescription"
            android:layout_width="match_parent"
            android:layout_height="wrap_content"
            android:layout_gravity="center_horizontal"
            android:text="RecyclerView Item Description"
            android:textAppearance="?android:attr/textAppearanceMedium" />
    </LinearLayout>
</LinearLayout>
 And res/layout/native_ad.xml <LinearLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    xmlns:ads="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
    android:orientation="vertical">

    <com.google.android.gms.ads.NativeExpressAdView
        android:id="@+id/nativeAdView"
        android:layout_width="wrap_content"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        ads:adSize="340x100"
        ads:adUnitId="@string/admob_native_ad">

    </com.google.android.gms.ads.NativeExpressAdView>

</LinearLayout>
 In the MainActivity layout file add a RecyclerView layout. <android.support.v7.widget.RecyclerView
    xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    android:id="@+id/recyclerview"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent"/>
 Setup RecyclerView Adapter For a RecyclerView to display content it needs an adapter and a ViewHolder. Create a new java class called RV_Adapter and add the following code. public class RV_Adapter extends RecyclerView.Adapter<ViewHolder> {

    private static final int ITEM = 0;
    private static final int NATIVE_AD = 1;
    int[] viewTypes;
    List<Data> list = Collections.emptyList();

    public RV_Adapter(List<Data> list, int[] viewTypes) {
        this.list = list;
        this.viewTypes = viewTypes;
    }

    @Override
    public ViewHolder onCreateViewHolder(ViewGroup parent, int viewType) {
        //Inflate the layout, initialize the View Holder
        View v;
        if (viewType == ITEM) {
            v = LayoutInflater.from(parent.getContext()).inflate(R.layout.item_layout, parent, false);
            ViewHolder holder = new ItemViewHolder(v);
            return holder;
        } else if (viewType == NATIVE_AD) {
            v = LayoutInflater.from(parent.getContext()).inflate(R.layout.native_ad, parent, false);
            ViewHolder holder = new AdViewHolder(v);
            return holder;
        }
        return null;
    }

    @Override
    public void onBindViewHolder(ViewHolder viewHolder, int position) {
        if (viewHolder.getItemViewType() == ITEM) {
            ItemViewHolder holder = (ItemViewHolder) viewHolder;
            //populate the RecyclerView
            //holder.title.setText(list.get(position).getTitle());
            //holder.description.setText(list.get(position).getDescription());
        } else if (viewHolder.getItemViewType() == NATIVE_AD) {
            AdViewHolder holder = (AdViewHolder) viewHolder;
            //Load the Ad
            AdRequest request = new AdRequest.Builder()
                    .build();
            holder.adView.loadAd(request);
        }
    }

    @Override
    public int getItemCount() {
        return list.size();
    }

    @Override
    public void onAttachedToRecyclerView(RecyclerView recyclerView) {
        super.onAttachedToRecyclerView(recyclerView);
    }

    @Override
    public int getItemViewType(int position) {
        return viewTypes[position];
    }
}

class ViewHolder extends RecyclerView.ViewHolder {
    public ViewHolder(View v) {
        super(v);
    }
}

class ItemViewHolder extends ViewHolder {

    TextView title;
    TextView description;

    ItemViewHolder(View itemView) {
        super(itemView);
        title = (TextView) itemView.findViewById(R.id.itemTitle);
        description = (TextView) itemView.findViewById(R.id.itemDescription);
    }
}

class AdViewHolder extends ViewHolder {
    NativeExpressAdView adView;

    public AdViewHolder(View v) {
        super(v);
        adView = (NativeExpressAdView) v.findViewById(R.id.nativeAdView);
    }
}
 This class contains the RecyclerView.Adapter and three ViewHolder classes for the different RecyclerView items. There’s a lot of code and three other java classes only used in this adapter. You are free to implement them in different files, but make sure to import the right references to those classes. You load Native Ads in the RecyclerView in the adapters onBindViewHolder(). Binding this ad is similar to Banner Ads. The RecyclerView is filled with a list of Data objects, so create the following class in the Android project. public class Data {

    private String title;
    private String description;

    public String getTitle() {
        return title;
    }

    public void setTitle(String title) {
        this.title = title;
    }

    public String getDescription() {
        return description;
    }

    public void setDescription(String description) {
        this.description = description;
    }
}
 Displaying a List of Ads The final step to integrate Native Ads in a RecyclerView is to create the following function in MainActivity. private void initRecyclerView() {
  //Create dummy data for RecyclerView
  int listSize = 50;
  int ITEM = 0;
  int NATIVE_AD = 1;
  List<Data> data = new ArrayList<>();
  int[] viewTypes = new int[listSize];
  for (int i = 0; i < listSize; i++) {
      data.add(new Data());
      //insert native ads once in five items
      if (i > 1 && i % 5 == 0) {
          viewTypes[i] = NATIVE_AD;
      } else {
          viewTypes[i] = ITEM;
      }
  }
  RecyclerView recyclerView = (RecyclerView) findViewById(R.id.recyclerview);
  RV_Adapter adapter = new RV_Adapter(data, viewTypes);
  recyclerView.setAdapter(adapter);
  recyclerView.setLayoutManager(new LinearLayoutManager(this));
}
 This function generates a list of 50 Data items, with a Native Ad inserted every 5 items. In a real life project you wouldn’t insert ads this frequently as it would lead to a bad user experience. When the RecyclerView adapter is initiated, it’s constructor passes an array of Integers to notify the adapter when it’s time to display an Ad. Call this function in the MainActivity onCreate() method and run the project. Targeting Another great feature of AdMob is the possibility to target a specified user, to display ads related to specific conditions. Examples of targeting are displaying ads related to a specified location or user gender. To display ads based on a target group specify a targeting specification in AdRequest.Builder(). Here’s an example on how to target users based on location: AdRequest request = new AdRequest.Builder()
    .setLocation(userLocation)
    .build();
 Based on gender: AdRequest request = new AdRequest.Builder()
    .setGender(AdRequest.GENDER_FEMALE)
    .build();
 Based on birthday:     AdRequest adRequest = new AdRequest.Builder()
    .setBirthday(userBirthdayDate)
    .build();
 Based on Child-directed policies, and whether Google should treat the ad content as child-directed. AdRequest adRequest = new AdRequest.Builder()
    .tagForChildDirectedTreatment(true)
    .build();
 Let the Cents Roll In And that’s the basics for integrating AdMob ads into Android apps.

Thank you for supporting the partners who make SitePoint possible. More from this author Dropped in the Rankings? Diagnose, Minimize & Reverse the Damage Google Algorithms Explained, Pt. 2: Provide Better Answers Google Algorithms Explained, Part 1: Don't Be Spam A robots.txt file is a plain text file that specifies whether or not a crawler should or shouldn’t access specific folders, subfolders or pages, along with other information about your site. The file uses the Robots Exclusion Standard, a protocol set in 1994 for websites to communicate with crawlers and other bots. It’s absolutely essential that you use a plain text file. Creating a robots.txt file using HTML or a word processor will include code that search engine crawlers will ignore if they can’t read. How Does It Work? When a site owner wants to give some guidance to web crawlers, they put their robots.txt file in the root directory of their site, e.g. https://www.example.com/robots.txt. Bots that follow this protocol will fetch and read the file before fetching any other file from the site. If the site doesn’t have a robots.txt, the crawler will assume the webmaster didn’t want to give any specific instructions and will go on to crawl the entire site. Robots.txt is made up of two basic parts: User-agent and directives. User-Agent User-agent is the name of the spider being addressed, while the directive lines provide the instructions for that particular user-agent. The User-agent line always goes before the directive lines in each set of directives. A very basic robots.txt looks like this: User-agent: Googlebot

Disallow: /
 These directives instruct the user-agent Googlebot, Google’s web crawler, to stay away from the entire server — it won’t crawl any page on the site. If you want to give instructions to multiple robots, create a set of user-agents and disallow directives for each one. User-agent: Googlebot

Disallow: /

User-agent: Bingbot

Disallow: /
 Now both Google and Bing’s user-agents know to avoid crawling the entire site. If you want to set the same requirement for all robots, you can use what’s called a wildcard, represented with an asterisk (*). So if you want to allow all robots to crawl your entire site, your robots.txt file should look like this: User-agent: *

Disallow: 
 It’s worth noting that search engines will choose the most specific user-agent directives they can find. So, for example, say you have four sets of user-agents: One using using a wildcard (*), one for Googlebot, one for Googlebot-News and one for Bingbot, and your site is visited by the Googlebot-Images user-agent. That bot will follow the instructions for Googlebot, as it is the most specific set of directives that apply to it. The most common search engine user-agents are: User-Agent Search Engine Field baiduspider Baidu General baiduspider-image Baidu Images baiduspider-mobile Baidu Mobile baiduspider-news Baidu News baiduspider-video Baidu Video bingbot Bing General msnbot Bing General msnbot-media Bing Images & Video adidxbot Bing Ads Googlebot Google General Googlebot-Image Google Images Googlebot-Mobile Google Mobile Googlebot-News Google News Googlebot-Video Google Video Mediapartners-Google Google AdSense AdsBot-Google Google AdWords slurp Yahoo! General yandex Yandex General Disallow The second part of robots.txt is the disallow line. This directive tells spiders which pages they aren’t allowed to crawl. You can have multiple disallow lines per set of directives, but only one user-agent. You don’t have to put any value for the disallow directive; bots will interpret an empty disallow value to mean that you aren’t disallowing anything and will access the entire site. As we mentioned earlier, if you want to deny access to the entire site to a bot (or all bots), use a slash (/). You can get granular with disallow directives by specifying specific pages, directories, subdirectories and file types. To block crawlers from a specific page, use that page’s relative link in the disallow line: User-agent: *

Disallow: /directory/page.html
 Block access to whole directories the same way: User-agent: *

Disallow: /folder1/

Disallow: /folder2/
 You can also use robots.txt to block bots from crawling certain file types by using a wildcard and file type in the disallow line: User-agent: *

Disallow: /*.ppt

Disallow: /images/*.jpg

Disallow: /duplicatecontent/copy*.html
 While the robots.txt protocol technically doesn’t support the use of wildcards, search engine bots are able to recognize and interpret them. So in the directives above, a robot would automatically expand the asterisk to match the path of the filename. For example, it would be able to figure out that www.example.com/presentations/slideshow.ppt and www.example.com/images/example.jpg are disallowed while www.example.com/presentations/slideshowtranscript.html isn’t. The third disallows crawling of any file in the /duplicatecontent/ directory that starts with ‘copy’ and ends in ‘.html’. So these pages are blocked: /duplicatecontent/copy.html /duplicatecontent/copy1.html /duplicatecontent/copy2.html /duplicatecontent/copy.html?id=1234 However, it would not disallow any instances of ‘copy.html’ stored in another directory or subdirectory. One issue you might encounter with your robots.txt file is that some URLs contain excluded patterns in URLs we would actually want to be crawled. From our earlier example of Disallow: /images/*.jpg, that directory might contain a file called ‘description-of-.jpg.html’. That page would not be crawled because it matches the exclusion pattern. To resolve this, add a dollar symbol ($) to signify that it represents the end of a line. This will tell search engine crawlers to avoid only files that end in the exclusion pattern. So Disallow: /images/*.jpg$ blocks only files that end in ‘.jpg’ while allowing files that include ‘.jpg’ in the title. Allow Sometimes you might want to exclude every file in a directory but one. You can do this the hard way by writing a disallow line for every file except the one you want crawled. Or you can use the Allow directive. It works pretty much like you would expect it to: Add the ‘Allow’ line to the group of directives for a user-agent: User-agent: *

Allow: /folder/subfolder/file.html

Disallow: /folder/subfolder/
 Wildcards and pattern-matching rules work the same for the Allow directive as they do for Disallow. Non-Standard Directives There are a few other directives you can use in your robots.txt file that aren’t universally recognized by search engines. One is the Host directive. This is recognized by Yandex, the most popular search engine in Russia, and works as a www resolve. However, as it seems Yandex is the only major search engine that supports the Host directive, we don’t recommend using it. The best way to handle the www resolve is using 301 redirects. Another directive that’s supported by some search engines is crawl-delay. It specifies a numerical value that represents a number of seconds — the crawl-delay line should look like crawl-delay: 15. It’s used differently by Yahoo!, Bing and Yandex. Yahoo! and Bing use the value as a wait time between crawl actions while Yandex will use it as a wait time for accessing your site. If you’ve got a big site you probably don’t want to use this directive as it can seriously limit the number of pages that get crawled. However, if you get little to no traffic from those search engines, you can use crawl-delay to save bandwidth. You can also set the crawl-delay to specific user agents. For example, you may find that your site is frequently crawled by SEO tools, which could slow down your site. You may also wish to block them all together if you don’t feel they are helping you. Finally, you can use your robots.txt file to tell search engines where to find your sitemap by adding the Sitemap: line anywhere in the file. This directive is independent of user-agent so bots will be able to interpret it wherever you put it, but it’s best to put it at the end to make things easier on yourself. Create a new sitemap line for every sitemap that you have, including your image and video sitemaps or your sitemap index file. If you would rather your sitemap location was not available for all to see, you may prefer to leave this out and instead submit sitemaps to the search engines directly. Learn more about how to create and optimize your XML sitemap here. Why Would You Want One? If getting your site crawled, indexed and ranked in search engine results is the whole point of SEO, why would you ever want to exclude files on your site? There’s a couple of reasons you’d want to block bot access to areas of your site: You’ve got private folders, subfolders or files on your site — just keep in mind that anyone can read your robots.txt file, so highlighting the location of a private file using the disallow directive would reveal it to the world. By blocking less important pages on your site you prioritize the bots’ crawl budget. This means they’ll spend more time crawling and indexing your most important pages. If you don’t get traffic from certain search engines, save bandwidth by disallowing their user-agents. There’s no point in having Yandex or Baidu fetching your files if they don’t send you any organic traffic. You can also use robots.txt to prevent search engines from indexing duplicate content. If you use URL parameters that result in your site housing the same content across several pages, use wildcards to exclude those URLs: User-agent: *

Disallow: /*?
 This will prevent crawlers from accessing any pages that have question marks in the URL, which is often how parameters are added. This is especially helpful for e-commerce sites that wind up with lots of URL parameters causing a ton of duplicate content due to product filtering and sorting. It’s best practice to block access to your site while redesigning or migrating, which we covered in detail previously. Block access to your entire new site to avoid having it associated with duplicate content, which will hinder its ability to rank in the future. Common Problems with Robots.txt and How to Fix Them To check if you’ve got a problem with your robots.txt, open up Google Search Console. Check your Crawl Stats report to see if there’s a big drop off in the number of pages crawled per day; this could indicate a problem with your robots.txt. Possibly the biggest problem with robots.txt files is accidentally disallowing pages you actually want to get crawled. This information can be found in your GSC Crawl Errors report. Check for pages that return a 500 response code. This is the code often returned for pages blocked by robots.txt. Check any URLs that return a 500 error code against your disallow directives in the robots.txt file. Some other common issues with robots.txt files are: Accidentally adding forward slashes at the end of file names. Even though your canonical URL might include the trailing slash, adding this to the end of a line in robots.txt will cause bots to interpret it as a directory, not a file, blocking every page in the folder. Double check your disallow lines for trailing slashes that shouldn’t be there. Blocking resources like CSS and JavaScript codes using robots.txt. However, this will impact the way search engines will see your page. A while back Google stated that disallowing CSS and Javascript will count against your SEO. Google can read your CSS and JS code and use it to draw conclusions about your site. When it sees blocked resources like this it can’t properly render your page which will keep you from ranking as highly as you could otherwise. Using more than one User-agent directive per line. Search engines will disregard directives that include more than one user-agent in a line, which can cause them to improperly crawl your site. Improper capitalization of directory, subdirectory and file names. While the actual directives used in robots.txt are not case sensitive, their values are. So Search engines see Disallow: page.html, Disallow: Page.html and Disallow: page.HTML as three separate files. If your robots.txt file includes directives for ‘Page.html’ but your canonical URL is in all lowercase, that page will get crawled. Using the Noindex directive. It’s a little known secret in SEO that you can use the noindex directive in your robots.txt file. However, John Mueller stated last year that you should avoid using noindex in your robots.txt file. So follow best practice and stick to the disallow and allow directives. Contradicting your sitemap in your robots.txt file. This is most likely to happen if you use different tools to create your sitemap and robots.txt files. Contradicting yourself in front of the search engines is always a bad idea. Fortunately this is pretty easy to find and fix. Submit and crawl your sitemap via GSC. It will provide you with a list of errors that you can then check against your robots.txt file to see if you’ve excluded it there. Disallowing pages in your robots.txt file that use the noindex meta tag. Crawlers blocked from accessing the page won’t be able to see the noindex tag, which can cause your page to appear in search results if it’s linked to from another page. It’s also common to struggle with the robots.txt syntax, especially if you don’t have much of a technical background. One solution is to have someone who is familiar with the robots protocol to go over your file for syntax errors. Your other, and probably better option, is to go right to Google for testing. Open the tester in Google Search Console and paste in your robots.txt file and hit Test. What’s really handy here is that not only will it find errors in your file, but you can also see if you’re disallowing pages that Google has indexed. When creating or changing your robots.txt file you really must test it thoroughly using this tool. Adding a robots.txt file that has errors will likely seriously impact your site’s ability to get crawled and indexed, which can cause it to fall out of the search rankings. You could even wind up blocking your entire site from appearing in search results! Is your robots.txt file properly implemented? Audit your site using WooRank to make sure you’re optimized across 70+ criteria including on page, technical and local factors.

WooRankTeam Very true Lars, as we mentioned above, highlighting the location of a private file using the disallow directive would reveal it to the world. Many don’t realize this – I often see robots.txt attempting to hide folders. To avoid this, either add the nofollow, noindex meta tax or place private pages behind a login.

Tim Moynihan Gear Date of Publication: 09.10.16. 09.10.16 Time of Publication: 6:45 am. 6:45 am Vizio Takes On Sonos With Its Double-Duty Wireless Speakers Vizio Sonos speakers are great, and they’ve popularized multi-room wireless audio. They still have weaknesses. They don’t do Bluetooth, they need to be plugged into power outlets, and even when Sonos opens itself up to Spotify early next year, you need Sonos’s app to play music from other sources. Vizio sees those shortcomings as opportunities. The company has been making soundbars to slot under its affordable televisions a while, but its new SmartCast Crave speakers are its first standalone speakers designed for wireless multi-room audio. Like newer Vizio TVs, they offer deep integration with Google Cast: Any Google Cast-supported audio app streams directly to the speakers over Wi-Fi or Ethernet. You use your mobile device as a controller, but the speakers form their own connection to streaming services. It’s a living-room (or kitchen or bedroom) Wi-Fi speaker that can also be used as a portable Bluetooth speaker—and a good one, at that. The one primed to give the Sonos Play:1 a run for the money is the Crave 360. It’s a cylindrical speaker with a magnetic charging base, pumping out 95 decibels of sound in all directions with four 1.5-inch drivers and a single 3.5-inch subwoofer. It also looks pretty slick, with a stainless steel tube of a grille, a rotating glass-covered top for volume and playback controls, and a leather strap for toting it around. You can leave it on that plugged-in charging base when you’re at home, then pop it off to use as a high-end portable Bluetooth or Wi-Fi speaker with its 8-hour battery. So it’s a living-room (or kitchen or bedroom) Wi-Fi speaker that can also be used as a portable Bluetooth speaker—and a good one, at that. Although it also supports both Bluetooth and Wi-Fi Google Cast playback, the upcoming Crave Pro is a fixed, plug-in speaker. It has a pair of 2-inch drivers and 5.25-inch subwoofers, and it gets louder than the Crave 360 at 102 decibels. Like the Crave 360, it also has an Ethernet port. The major tradeoff is that it doesn’t have a built-in battery. Or a strap. Like Sonos, these speakers are designed to team up for multi-room audio over Wi-Fi. You can pair a Crave 360 to other Crave 360s, a Vizio soundbar, or the Crave Pro to crank the same song in several rooms. For that, you’ll need to use Vizio’s SmartCast app to group or separate the speakers. Because it’s designed for multi-room listening, not multi-channel listening, there are limitations to the system. You can’t use each speaker to play individual channels in a surround setup. You can only mirror music on several speakers throughout the house. Perhaps the biggest drawback compared to Sonos is that Vizio’s system doesn’t form a mesh network. As such, the speakers will likely need to be placed in rooms with strong Wi-Fi, and adding a bunch of them to your home network may take a toll on performance. But if a portable, dual Bluetooth/Wi-Fi speaker with multi-room audio skills is what you’ve been waiting for, the Crave 360 is a reasonably affordable fit. It’s available now for $250, while the more-powerful Crave Pro will be out “soon” for $300. Go Back to Top.

Science fiction authors, from Jules Verne to Gene Roddenberry and George Lucas, have made many bold predictions of where our technology may take us, and many of them have come to pass. Here are four technologies from science fiction that exist today. What an exciting time to be alive! 1. Crime Prediction What if law enforcement could stop crime before it happened? That was the idea behind the 2002 film Minority Report, which in turn was inspired by the Philip K. Dick short story of the same name. A trio of mutated humans have the ability to see murders before they happen, and it’s up to a crack team of police officers to stop them. Psychic mutants sit on the most fantastic fringe of science fiction, but maybe the idea of trying to predict crimes before they happen isn’t too far out there. The Los Angeles Police Department has been using big data and predictive analytics to guess when and where a crime might take place. This experiment has borne fruit, and in the areas where the software has been used, there’s been a 33% reduction in burglaries, a 21% reduction in violent crimes, and a 12% reduction in property crime. This is significant when you consider the relatively high crime rate of Los Angeles and the large size of the city. Ads by Google The software is based on those used to predict earthquakes aftershocks. The LAPD has used its record of 13 million crimes committed over the past 80 years. This is used to predict what crimes will occur after another crime has been committed. These predictions are then used when making decisions about planning patrols and assigning officers. 2. Talking Computers From Star Trek‘s Data and the computer, to HAL 9000, and even Her (CA, UK), it has been predicted that one day we would be able to converse with our computers as we would with a friend or a colleague. Although we’re far away from the palpably human experience that some science fiction writers have imagined, we’re getting close. Just check out this device from CommBadge Technologies. You can thank two specific technologies Alexa, How Does Siri Work? Voice Control Explained Alexa, How Does Siri Work? Voice Control Explained The world is moving towards voice commands for everything, but how exactly does voice control work? Why is it so glitchy and restricted? Here's what you need to know as a layman user. Read More for this: voice recognition technology and natural language processing (NLP). The former transforms the analog sound-waves created by your mouth into text. This has existed for a really long time, but for a while the technology struggled with accuracy and efficiency. Now it’s at the point where it can be used to dictate an entire document How Voice Typing Is the New Best Feature of Google Docs How Voice Typing Is the New Best Feature of Google Docs Voice recognition has improved by leaps and bounds in recent years. Earlier this week, Google finally introduced voice typing into Google Docs. But is it any good? Let's find out! Read More — much progress has been made. The latter takes that generated text and then interprets the meaning of it. Modern NLP algorithms are based on machine learning, with many of those algorithms taking advantage of artificial neural networks to determine what the user wants and to learn from previous interactions. The end result of this is that we now have programs like Apple’s Siri The Master List of Every Siri Command and Question The Master List of Every Siri Command and Question Siri can do a lot for you, but did you know she could do this much? Here's an exhaustive list of commands Siri will take.

She knows exactly what I need and has a wicked sense of humour. It's little wonder that I've fallen for the charms of Cortana. Read More , which allow us to ask questions and dictate questions to our phone and actually get a meaningful response. We can even ask follow-up questions to the responses we get and hold something that almost — almost! — feels like a real conversation. 3. Personal Communicators When Captain James Tiberius Kirk was on an away mission and needed to contact the Enterprise, he’d use his trusty communicator. This was a flip device which would allow him to talk in real-time with whoever was left at the helm. At the end of the 1960s, this was utterly unthinkable. But then the 90s came along and gave us flip-phones. These were essentially what Rodenberry had imagined, both in function and in form-factor, but with the added bonus that these could play Snake. Yes, it could be argued that the cell phone is essentially what a Star Trek communicator is. Later series of Star Trek turned the humble communicator from a handheld device to one that was embedded into a badge pinned to a uniform. While we’ve yet to create something as sleek and as good looking as what Picard and Sisko wore, we’re getting there. Other science fiction cannons have imagined what communications technology could be, if only we had advanced a bit more. In Star Wars: The Phantom Menace (CA, UK), for example, Qui Gon Jin used a communicator called a Comlink that was no bigger than a stick of gum. It could be argued that here Lucas was trying to reflect trends at the time for consumer technology to be increasingly miniaturized. Not long after, we saw entire mobile phones fitting into chassis no larger than a car key fob. Indeed, my first Android smartphone — the Sony Ericsson Xperia Mini 10 — was no larger than a box of matches, so perhaps Lucas wasn’t that far off the mark. 4. Food Replicators One of the most ambitious inventions of the Star Trek universe is the matter replicator. This could create — quite literally — anything out of thin air: food, water, clothing, even weaponry. Here’s how Wikipedia explains it: A replicator works by rearranging subatomic particles, which are abundant everywhere in the universe, to form molecules and arrange those molecules to form the object. For example, to create a pork chop, the replicator would first form atoms of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, etc., then arrange them into amino acids, proteins, and cells, and assemble the particles into the form of a pork chop. Okay, so we’re a long way away from that. But maybe — just maybe — we’ve got something close. Right now, we actually have 3D printers 30 Useful Ways 3D Printing Could Be Used At Home 30 Useful Ways 3D Printing Could Be Used At Home In the future, 3D printers will be as essential in a home as having a smartphone or wireless Internet. Here's a glimpse into the things you can 3D print already to upgrade your home. Read More that can create dishes from recipes using a set of base materials, and the most well-known of these is the upcoming Foodini from the Barcelona-based startup Natural Machines. Foodini’s ambition is to make it as convenient to create healthy meals as it is to shove a pizza in the oven. If one wanted to make fresh ravioli, for example, here’s how it would work: … load the dough and filling into Foodini, and Foodini will print individual raviolis for you. The 3D printing of food — in this case, creating a layer of pasta, a layer of filling, and covering it with a layer of pasta again — is assembling the ravioli. The same as you would do by hand, except Foodini automates it. Another one which has been compared to Star Trek‘s replicator is the Genie. This is a bit harder to explain, so just imagine if your Keurig coffee maker actually cooked you dinner. Pods of healthy, natural ingredients are inserted, and the machine works its magic (no pun intended). We’re far away from the machine Gene Roddenberry thought would end world hunger, but not that far off. Which Sci-Fi Tech Do You Wish Existed?

This means it has a lot of information on you, used by Google for a multitude of reasons like improving its services and bringing up more targeted ads. Not only is everything you search for on its search engine saved, but so too are searches on Google Play, YouTube, Maps, image search, reminders and even voice search. Google saves all of this info so it can serve up more relevant searches and information whenever you use its services, but you always have the option of deleting or turning things off if you wish. To see everything you’ve ever searched for, you need to head over to the My Activity page that is tied in with your Google account. Alternatively, you can go into the My Account dashboard (myaccount.google.com/privacy) and you will find the option there. Here you will see all of the searches you’ve made through Google products as long as you have had an account. For many, this will go back years. While you can scroll through all the results chronologically, you can also search for results by type. So if you’re a fan of using Google Now, specifically its voice searching, you can select that and play back the audio clip of you speaking. Sometimes it will include a transcript of what you said, but you need to have been speaking clearly for it to understand. Source: Google The full list of services you can search for specifically include: Ads, Android, Books, Chrome, Finance, Goggles, Help, Image Search, Maps, Maps Timeline, News, Now, Play, Search, Shopping, Video Search, Voice & Audio, and YouTube. If you want Google to remove them or stop keeping a record of all of these, you can. If you click on the options icon at the top right hand corner (the three horizontal dots), you can delete them by going into Delete Activity By and choosing the relevant timeframe. Alternatively, you can search for a specific thing like Maps and delete them by clicking the options menu in the search bar. The option Delete Results will appear here. On the same menu, you can go into Activity Controls and turn off the settings for different services. The first option, Web & App Activity, deals with searches but you might also want to disable Maps, YouTube and voice search as well.

When it comes to what may be the most important business resource of the 21st century — cloud services — there can be no doubt that AWS is clearly dominating the market. Everyone else is years behind in functionality, ease-of-use and price, and for many, if not most, workloads, AWS is literally better, faster, and cheaper than its competitors. However, although it looks like “cloud means Amazon”, we should resist the temptation to conclude that the cloud war is over. We’ve only seen the initial skirmish, and the most valuable company in the world is about to step up. Google is escalating its cloud offering with GCE, while Microsoft, IBM, and a few other players are simultaneously getting ready for what they no doubt view as the ‘Contest of the Century’. We all win if we stay neutral, allowing them to duke it out as cloud computing becomes increasingly commoditized. Simultaneously, a battle is brewing between those who use these services (which, before too long, will be just about everybody). The losers will go with proprietary solutions from cloud providers and the winners will pick solutions that run everywhere AND leverage the best of each. Google Gets Serious, it’s On! Has AWS’s success awakened a sleeping giant? Google is getting serious, evidenced by its appointment of board member Diane Greene, co-founder of VMware — who had been for years been telling the company that it was missing a big opportunity — as head of Google Cloud Platform. Such keen interest from a company with possibly the world’s largest computing network illustrates the sheer scale of the war for a market that may grow to hundreds of billions of dollars in the next few years. Here’s a quick and dirty recap of the contest: AWS is of course the undisputable top dog, with a million+ customers, 2015 revenues of $7 billion range, companies like Netflix running their entire infrastructure on their services, and a frighteningly huge portion of the world’s web activities run through their servers. Microsoft, led by a CEO who once oversaw its cloud computing unit, is taking square aim at AWS and sits in second place with a pitch that emphasizes enterprise-readiness. IBM takes the number three spot, playing up such angles as hybrid integration and cognitive computing, while Google takes number four and appears to be positioning itself as the cloud provider for Big Data. The growing list of heavyweight contenders also includes HP, AT&T, and Oracle (although Oracle comes with pretty unique baggage). Of course, these companies have their disadvantages too, and no doubt we’ll see them playing to their competitor’s weaknesses, as well as their own strengths. Retailers view Amazon as a competitor, while Microsoft (and Oracle) have reputations for bullying. And all face very valid concerns about vendor lock-in. Play the Cloud Field by Keeping Your Options Open All of these companies are growing their cloud businesses ridiculously fast. But, that’s partially because there’s still plenty of business to go around–everyone hasn’t adopted cloud computing yet. Now that cloud computing has become ubiquitous, the only way for any of these companies to gain serious market share is to take it from a competitor. And we’re already seeing some positive effects from the intense competition … like a kinder, gentler Microsoft? The Seattle-based titan, observes Alex Konrad of Forbes, is already shifting its strategy and culture away from pushing a Windows-only world on its customers. He points out that they may very well have read the writing on the wall when they lost Salesforce to AWS. The message was clear: “cool it, you’re not the biggest kid on the block anymore”. But Amazon, he asserts, needs to cool it too, acting “less like a Bezos-driven, ruthlessly effective operation.” Beyond cultural changes, each provider has its sweet spot, and one of the advantages of using multiple vendors is that you’re free to play to their strengths–tapping Google’s speech recognition and maps, or Microsoft’s security, or Amazon’s price and availability. Coca-Cola, for one, is spreading its apps across all three, citing advantages of flexibility, says Konrad.   It also means that you’re avoiding a problem which is often cited as a pitfall of the on-premise world, but that is just as real in the cloud: vendor lock-in. “Most of the big companies I talk to about cloud deployments are leery of putting all their eggs in one cloud basket. They feel that by using more than one cloud provider, they can keep the other provider honest. Most of these companies have faced vendor lock-in before and feel abused by IT suppliers that made it difficult to move to a rival product or even integrate their technology with that of another company,” says Barb Darrow, Forbes. Databases Feel the Gravity of Vendor Lock-In More Than Other Applications While Matt Asay takes a contrarian view to vendor lock-in, asserting that standardizing on a few vendors “makes life easier”, he concedes the wisdom of maintaining some independence. “Buy all the cloudy infrastructure you want from your vendor of choice, but try to keep your data separate.” The temptation to throw all your eggs in one basket, he points out, may be compounded by the fact that the major cloud vendors have been developing their own database services — AWS Aurora, Microsoft Azure SQL Database, and Google’s Cloud SQL, to name only a few. But such proprietary solutions may be worth avoiding, he says, because “gravitational pull” is stronger on the database than other platforms. Once your data is in, you’ll have to reach a pretty high “escape velocity” to get out (and that escape velocity will no doubt include time, resources, and no small amount of buy-in from departments and leadership). This is a pitfall that we’ll likely see many companies encounter in coming years, as people struggle to determine best practices for optimizing their businesses in the cloud. Nevertheless, it’s one that can largely be avoided by choosing databases that are deployable in any environment–whether it be in the cloud, or on-premises. By doing so, you’ll lower your escape velocity significantly, and achieve the same kind of portability at the database layer, which you have with other cloud-based web applications. And thus you retain the freedom to experiment with the various goodies that AWS, Google, Microsoft, IBM, and others are bound to offer. The Cloud Zone is brought to you in partnership with Internap.

 This Bill Gates-backed tech startup is on a mission to fundamentally change the way scientists work Sam Shead Sep. 10, 2016, 3:24 AM 3,410 facebook linkedin twitter email print ResearchGate CEO Ijad Madisch. ResearchGate Meet Ijad Madisch. He's a Berlin-based entrepreneur on a mission to change the way scientists go about their research. The computer science graduate and qualified doctor set up a company called ResearchGate in 2008 when he realised that scientists were making the same mistakes over and over again as a result of not sharing their work publicly. "It's one of the biggest problems we have in the world, especially if we are repeating mistakes made by other scientists that cost us a lot of time and money," Madisch told Business Insider. ResearchGate can be described as a social network for scientists. It started off as a free-to-use platform for academics but it's become increasingly popular with scientists working in corporates, including tech firms like Google and Facebook. There are currently 1,145 Google employees registered on the platform and 199 Facebook employees. In total, ResearchGate boasts over 10 million users. "ResearchGate has become the biggest and most active scientific social network in the world over the last couple of years," claims Madisch. "From the beginning, the focus was on convincing scientists to share publication data." The company claims not to have any competitors but it's worth noting that it was compared to London's Mendeley and San Francisco's Academia.edu in a Times Higher Education article that was published in April. Tackling the world's big problems with online 'Projects' Over the last eight years, tens of millions of pieces of scientific information have been uploaded onto ResearchGate's platform and today more than two million scientific publications are uploaded every month. In addition to publications, scientists are also uploading general articles, conference papers, and raw data. Now the company wants to make it even easier for scientists to collaborate on chunky problems like climate change and illnesses like HIV and cancer. Scientists aiming to tackle meaty issues like climate change are using ResearchGate's platform to share updates. Michael Kappeler/Reuters "Recently we launched a 'Project' feature where scientists can collaborate in real time and document what they have found within the experiment," said Madisch. "I envision a different way of publishing and documenting science in the future where you’re not going for results any more in larger articles but rather in way smaller updates where you don’t have to write the same things again and again." The Projects allow ResearchGate members to talk directly to the scientists running the experiments, possibly giving them feedback and making suggestions in the process. "Ultimately, the Projects give us a way to structure science better," said Madisch, before going on to claim that they also make it easier for scientists to find similar studies to those that they're working on themselves. More than 140,000 Projects have been launched since the feature went live approximately five months ago, Madisch said, adding: "This is a total new direction." One ongoing Project includes Nasa scientists who are using ResearchGate's platform to document their time in an isolated bubble on the side of a volcano in Hawaii, where conditions are designed to replicate those found on Mars. The isolated bubble on a volcano in Hawaii where Nasa scientists are aiming to replicate conditions on Mars. Cyprien Verseux/Nasa While in the bubble, the scientists' internet access is highly restricted but ResearchGate is one of the few websites they are able to use to share what they’re working on. Other ResearchGate Projects are aiming to tackle everything from avian influenza (bird flu) and malaria, to obesity and 3D-printing. More than 200 employees As ResearchGate's userbase has ballooned, the company's workforce has been forced to expand, with the headcount more than doubling over the last year from around 100 to 250. The growth of the company has been fuelled by investors who believe in the ResearchGate mission. A scientist pours samples into a tube. Cyprien Verseux/Nasa The size of ResearchGate's initial fund raises were not disclosed but the company raised $35 million (£26.3 million) in July 2013 in a round that was lead by Microsoft billionaire Bill Gates and venture capital firm Tenaya Capital. But it hasn't always been easy for ResearchGate to raise money. ResearchGate is free to sign up to and company's path to monetisation was called into question by early investors. In 2008 and 2009, VCs were asking Madisch how he planned to make money. "I said: 'Hey guys, you don’t get it. If this thing is going to be successful, if we change how scientists think — something that is way harder than making money with this network — then the potential is big.'" That said, ResearchGate is now making money from selling job recruitment space to companies and individuals who want to tap into the company's intelligent network. "We have 2,500 different institutions who have posted a job on ResearchGate," said Madisch. ResearchGate is also thinking about launching "a marketplace for lab services and lab equipment," according to Madisch, who says the market is worth $30 billion (£23 billion) in the US alone. Another one of the company's investors is Silicon Valley venture capitalist and former Facebook VP Matt Cohler, who is now general partner at Benchmark. "He (Cohler) didn’t ask how I wanted to make money," said Madisch. "He asked me what my personal goal was with ResearchGate and I said I want to win the Nobel Prize and he understood that." While many startups are look to exit when they get to a certain size, ResearchGate plans to play the long game. "Our plan is ultimately to stay independent," said Madisch.

(SGW) (otcqb:SGLDF) http://www.shoalgames.com ("the Company"), owner of Trophy Bingo (http://www.trophybingo.com), a mobile game live in the Apple, Google and Amazon App Stores, and Garfield's Bingo, currently in production and scheduled for a Q4 2016 release, today announced it is entering into a licensing arrangement with Rooplay Inc. to commercialize its innovative cloud-based gaming platform and consumer brand Rooplay. Initially developed in London, UK, the technology platform will be advanced by Shoal Games to prepare a unique product for launch in 2017. According to TechNavio cloud gaming will experience a CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) of 29.33% during the period 2016-2020. Shoal Games will release more information on the development of its cloud gaming initiative in the coming months. As part of the terms of the agreement, the co-founders of Rooplay, John Streit and Amir Shadmand, will assume advisory roles in Shoal Games to assist in the advancement of the technology and the launch of the product. John Streit has over 17 years of technology leadership, strategy, project management, technical architecture and digital production expertise. Until recently, John was the CTO OgilvyOne worldwide, London where he led local and dispersed teams of more than 100 members in the development and delivery of software applications to large commercial organisations. Amir Shadmand holds a PhD degree in mobile telecommunications from the King's College London where he received a number of awards and grants in his research. Amir is an expert in mobile cloud gaming technologies and is the co-founder and CEO of SUPENTA, the makers of Flitchio which is the world's first smartphone case with a built in game controller. "With the addition of Rooplay, Shoal Games will have three upcoming product launches, in addition to Trophy Bingo, and the team is excited," commented Jason Williams, the Company's CEO. "The first launch, Garfield's Bingo in English, Spanish, and Portuguese (Brazilian) will arrive in the App Stores in just a couple of months. Garfield's Bingo will be a first for mobile bingo games as no other bingo game features such a world-renowned brand ambassador. We anticipate bingo players will be excited to engage with Garfield, Odie, and the rest of cast in a challenging bingo-puzzle adventure. Second to market will be Garfield's Bingo China which provides an immense opportunity for Shoal Games to leverage the Garfield brand in a new region and distribute a proven product to the millions of Garfield fans in the country. Third to market will be Shoal Games' entry into the cloud gaming space with Rooplay. Rooplay will provide an additional strategic option for the Company in a burgeoning and exciting market. Myself, and the entire Shoal Games team are thrilled to have three new products entering the market in the coming quarters each with the potential to amplify our revenues and put Shoal Games into a strong financial position." The Company's primary focus remains the development and growth of its mobile free-2-play bingo platform. Trophy Bingo has been live in the Apple App Store, Google Play Store, and Amazon App Store for 12 months and has received more than 600,000 downloads generating over CAD $500,000 in gross revenue and more than 10,000 player reviews averaging a strong 4.4 on Google Play. Trophy Bingo has achieved these milestones because Shoal Games has built a robust game platform with industry leading monetization and retention features. Garfield's Bingo, built on the same mobile platform as Trophy Bingo, is scheduled for release in early Q4 2016. The significance of the Garfield license lies in the global popularity and recognition of the Garfield brand. Brand licenses of Pokemon, Star Wars, Marvel Heroes, and more, have helped to propel new mobile game releases into the Top Downloads and Top Grossing charts many times to date. Garfield (like Pokémon) has launched many products around the world and Garfield's Bingo will be ideally positioned to capitalize on the brand power of the famous cat. With over 200 million readers worldwide, Garfield is one of the most recognizable brands in existence. Garfield is close to ubiquitous in large countries such as America, Mexico, and Brazil. Shoal Games will be positioning Garfield's Bingo to climb the charts in each of these countries, and more, from its initial launch in Q4. One country that is particularly infatuated with Garfield and presents a unique opportunity for Shoal Games, is China. As China is one of the world's most buoyant mobile games markets, the Company is developing a bespoke version of Garfield's Bingo for launch in China in early 2017. Another Garfield game, Garfield Chef, launched in China in early 2016 and has received over 6,000,000 downloads to date. Shoal Games is seeking to engage a local distribution partner to launch Garfield's Bingo in the region. The opportunity to distribute Garfield's Bingo in China, and dozens of other large countries around the world, is immense and Shoal Games' management intends to maximize the potential of the Garfield brand to speed distribution. Additionally, Shoal Games has begun a re-structure of its development personnel in order to maximize the efficiency of the teams creating Trophy Bingo, Garfield's Bingo, and Rooplay. Under the guidance of Shoal Games' new VP of Development, Kirsten Forbes, the in-house teams will share programming, art, design, production and analytics resources to collaborate in a way that will ensure the Company's product development milestones are met. Kirsten has been making games since 1997. As Executive Producer at Radical Entertainment she made AAA console titles, shipping 11 high-profile games including CSI and Crash Bandicoot. Following Radical, Kirsten co-founded Silicon Sisters Interactive, Vancouver's first female led game development studio, where she shipped three premium titles. Prior to Shoal Games, Kirsten was VP Product Development at Roadhouse Interactive. Shoal Games Ltd. also announced today that it has entered into a Line of Credit and Loan Agreement (the "Agreement") with Pendinas Ltd. ("Pendinas") and Mr. Tarrnie Williams, the Company's Executive Chairman for the provision of up to $5.0 million USD.

(TSX VENTURE: SGW) (OTCQB: SGLDF) http://www.shoalgames.com ("the Company"), owner of Trophy Bingo (http://www.trophybingo.com), a mobile game live in the Apple, Google and Amazon App Stores, and Garfield's Bingo, currently in production and scheduled for a Q4 2016 release, today announced it is entering into a licensing arrangement with Rooplay Inc. to commercialize its innovative cloud-based gaming platform and consumer brand Rooplay. Initially developed in London, UK, the technology platform will be advanced by Shoal Games to prepare a unique product for launch in 2017. According to TechNavio cloud gaming will experience a CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) of 29.33% during the period 2016-2020. Shoal Games will release more information on the development of its cloud gaming initiative in the coming months. As part of the terms of the agreement, the co-founders of Rooplay, John Streit and Amir Shadmand, will assume advisory roles in Shoal Games to assist in the advancement of the technology and the launch of the product. John Streit has over 17 years of technology leadership, strategy, project management, technical architecture and digital production expertise. Until recently, John was the CTO OgilvyOne worldwide, London where he led local and dispersed teams of more than 100 members in the development and delivery of software applications to large commercial organisations. Amir Shadmand holds a PhD degree in mobile telecommunications from the King's College London where he received a number of awards and grants in his research. Amir is an expert in mobile cloud gaming technologies and is the co-founder and CEO of SUPENTA, the makers of Flitchio which is the world's first smartphone case with a built in game controller. "With the addition of Rooplay, Shoal Games will have three upcoming product launches, in addition to Trophy Bingo, and the team is excited," commented Jason Williams, the Company's CEO. "The first launch, Garfield's Bingo in English, Spanish, and Portuguese (Brazilian) will arrive in the App Stores in just a couple of months. Garfield's Bingo will be a first for mobile bingo games as no other bingo game features such a world-renowned brand ambassador. We anticipate bingo players will be excited to engage with Garfield, Odie, and the rest of cast in a challenging bingo-puzzle adventure. Second to market will be Garfield's Bingo China which provides an immense opportunity for Shoal Games to leverage the Garfield brand in a new region and distribute a proven product to the millions of Garfield fans in the country. Third to market will be Shoal Games' entry into the cloud gaming space with Rooplay. Rooplay will provide an additional strategic option for the Company in a burgeoning and exciting market. Myself, and the entire Shoal Games team are thrilled to have three new products entering the market in the coming quarters each with the potential to amplify our revenues and put Shoal Games into a strong financial position." The Company's primary focus remains the development and growth of its mobile free-2-play bingo platform. Trophy Bingo has been live in the Apple App Store, Google Play Store, and Amazon App Store for 12 months and has received more than 600,000 downloads generating over CAD $500,000 in gross revenue and more than 10,000 player reviews averaging a strong 4.4 on Google Play. Trophy Bingo has achieved these milestones because Shoal Games has built a robust game platform with industry leading monetization and retention features. Garfield's Bingo, built on the same mobile platform as Trophy Bingo, is scheduled for release in early Q4 2016. The significance of the Garfield license lies in the global popularity and recognition of the Garfield brand. Brand licenses of Pokemon, Star Wars, Marvel Heroes, and more, have helped to propel new mobile game releases into the Top Downloads and Top Grossing charts many times to date. Garfield (like Pokemon) has launched many products around the world and Garfield's Bingo will be ideally positioned to capitalize on the brand power of the famous cat.

While that represented a growth rate of 66.6% year-over-year, the sub total is also a drop in the bucket of the pay TV market.   “For those keeping score at home, that’s a little less than seven one hundredths of one percent of the U.S. video market,” Moffett wrote.   Update: Google Fiber responded to the report by saying it's "very pleased" with the progress it’s making on the TV front and that it is continuing to expand into multiple cities such as Atlanta, Charlotte and Salt Lake City   Kansas City, Mo., is Google Fiber’s largest TV market, with 42,050, subs, followed by Kansas City, Kan. (21,038); Provo, Utah (2,597); and Austin, Texas (2,812). Moffett also estimates that it ended the period with a mere 218 video subs in Stanford, Calif.   Those numbers don’t factor in high-speed Internet subs. Based on a report in The Information that Google Fiber had 200,000 broadband subs at the end of 2014, Moffett estimates that, if video penetration and broadband remained constant at 15%, Google Fiber would have had about 453,000 broadband customers by the end of June 2016.   That represents “a little less than one half of 1% of total broadband subscribers in the U.S.,” Moffett wrote, while also pointing out that Google Fiber, at least in recent years, had been offering a “free” 5 Mbps service in exchange for a $300 installation fee.   “From the beginning, we’d heard that this offer accounted for a very large share of their business (a couple of years ago, competitive intelligence estimates from their competitors in Kansas City put the number at about a third of all connections),” the analyst said.   And if this “shockingly low video attach rate is correct” (Google Fiber has yet to supply sub numbers), then the unit’s “economics must have been even worse than we had imagined” and could explain a recent report that Alphabet, Google’s parent company, has been pulling back on plans to roll into new markets.    The Information reported recently that Google Fiber is being pressured to cut back staff by half while it also looks into potentially less expensive, high performance wireless broadband technologies that might also help to accelerate the rate of service deployments. Google has not confirmed the report of staff cuts. Given some friendly estimates and assumptions that all of Google Fiber’s subs also take broadband along with one-third getting the free Internet offering, Moffett sees Google Fiber’s annualized run rate, based on June 2016 numbers, at about $300 million in revenue – or 0.3% of Google’s overall business.   “It’s hard to argue with the idea that after nearly seven years of pushing a rock uphill, having just three tenths of one percent of your business to show for it might be a bit discouraging,” Moffett said .   Google Fiber doesn’t break out its individual revenues, but it is part of “Other Bets,” the unit of Alphabet that includes Google Fiber and other longer-term “moonshot”  projects. Other bets ,generated Q2 revenues of $185 million, up from $74 million a year ago, while operating losses widened to $709 million, from $555 million.   Moffett also cited data from the NTIA/FCC showing that Google Fiber passings declined in the second half of 2015.   While fresher data isn’t currently available there, [t]hat kind of deceleration is a clear surprise given the amount of press Google has gotten,” Moffett said.   Want to read more stories like this?

As if that wasn’t enough to get webmasters off their chairs and start moving their websites to more secure encryption protocols, Google has announced their next move. Starting in January 2017, Google’s Chrome browser will start to mark HTTP websites as “Not secure”, meaning that visitors to HTTP websites will be alerted by this. Granted there could be nothing wrong with the website, but it sounds like Google wants users to know that there are steps that the website could have taken to get itself a secure rating. According to Google, “Studies show that users do not perceive the lack of a ‘secure’ icon as a warning, but also that users become blind to warnings that occur too frequently. Our plan to label HTTP sites more clearly and accurately as non-secure will take place in gradual steps, based on increasingly stringent criteria. Starting January 2017, Chrome 56 will label HTTP pages with password or credit card form fields as ‘not secure,’ given their particularly sensitive nature.” Google also notes that eventually HTTP websites will be given the red triangle warning indicator which should stand out more. Given Google’s reputation as pretty much the web’s de facto search engine, hopefully these changes will prompt webmasters to start thinking about their website’s security. Filed in Web.

Look up and the sky is yellow with smog. While China can be ultramodern, the industrial era is ever-present. Stepping inside the arena is like fast-forwarding 100 years. Some 15,000 technology professionals sit waiting in the packed air-conditioned arena. Soft, anywhere-in-the-world music plays through a flawless sound system getting everyone in the mood. The audience flew in from all over the globe to hear the latest on cloud computing. Later, sessions will run on creating state-of-the-art university networks and building smart cities. Blue skies indoors At the front of the hall, a giant video screen the size of a tennis court shows clouds in a blue, blue sky. A second screen, or series of screens, extends the giant display across the ceiling. Further screens relay images to those sitting too far away or in awkward corners. Next door an expo shows virtual reality tools, open source software and 3D printing. There is more, much more, about modern enterprise computing. This is Shanghai, China in the year of our internet 2016. From the airport you get to the city on a maglev train tipping the speedometer at over 300 kph. Once there you may see workers pedalling ancient push bikes pulling huge trailers. Contrasts, contradictions and anachronisms are everywhere. At times even dull everyday technology impresses. Our conference hotel offers free, unlimited Wi-Fi throughout the building. Speeds are not the fastest, it manages a symmetrical 10 Mbps all day long. That’s better than you get in many New Zealand hotels. Mobile networks are everywhere and deliver decent speeds. New Zealand technology users may notice the public wi-fi network based on telephone kiosks. Just like home. Broken internet Despite the modernity, the urge to embrace technology, China’s internet feels broken. You can get a fast net connection in seconds from almost everywhere. Google, Facebook and Twitter, to name three popular global services are off-limits. Shanghai, like the rest of mainland China, sits behind a series of network controls. Some call these controls The Great Firewall of China. There’s more to the Chinese cyber police than blocking popular international services. They watch Chinese internet users. That may include foreign journalists assigned to technology conferences. There is constant filtering and more direct censorship of material. Internet companies in China censor material on their own networks before it gets out. That saves time and money. Once in the wild subversive traffic could become a problem for the service providers. Net professionals are subject to regular government directives. Snoops sniff data packets, including the ones bringing you these words. The idea is to look for harmful foreign influences — this post probably doesn’t qualify. Crude start At first the Great Firewall was crude. On an earlier trip it blocked entire web domains if there was any suspicion of anything untoward. Today, the blocking is more subtle. The Great Firewall lets some sites through with only certain, troublesome pages censored. One change in recent years is the way the firewall blocks sites of interest to foreign users. Last year, on a trip to Shenzhen in Southern China, it blocked Google’s search engine and the Gmail web page. At the time it was still possible to reach the Gmail IMAP servers and load messages into a mail client. This trip, the Gmail IMAP server is inaccessible. Or at least more inaccessible than before. Now you can’t connect to the server from a laptop or a device reaching the internet through hotel wi-fi. It is still sometimes possible to reach Google’s IMAP server from an iPhone connected to the China Mobile network. Inconsistent This lack of consistency is a feature of dealing with the Great Firewall. Virtual private networks are a popular workaround for foreign journalists filing stories from China. Others use proxy servers. If you were a local and used VPNs a lot, you might attract someone’s attention. Then again you might not. No-one seemed concerned about visiting journalists using VPNs and proxy servers. China’s cyber-police have found ways to interfere with VPNs. This story was part written on an iPad Pro with Norton WiFi Privacy - a VPN. As the name suggests, Symantec sells the software as a tool for keeping WiFi traffic safe. It was never designed to beat China’s Great Firewall. It works up to a point. Yet while VPN performance is fine in New Zealand, it’s erratic in Shanghai. Norton WiFi Privacy keeps disconnecting. At times it connects to a server in China, even though that’s not an official Norton option. There are times when the VPN hums along. And times when it has to reconnect every few minutes, then it drops out again and again. It is as if something remote is resetting connections. Rise of the bots I’ve read elsewhere the Chinese government may use machine learning to block VPNs. If so, then in effect, users are fighting against artificial intelligence. Either way, there’s a remarkable level of sophistication. You may be a security expert who can shed light on the techniques used. Feel free to comment below. Working around the Great Firewall is frustrating. Want to check some facts? It’s hard when you can’t use Google and the Great Firewall blocks some newspapers. You have to know exactly what site you are looking for. Typing words into the browser bar may not work as expected. China allows Microsoft’s Bing search engine. It a local, censored version. Often Bing answers appear in Mandarin. That’s helpful for Chinese users, not for most westerners. Shanghai is a town where Google Maps could help you find your way around. It’s possible to find online maps and direction finding tools. They can be erratic and often text that was in western script a moment ago is, next minute, all in Mandarin. There are also strange behaviours with innocuous things like Apple’s iCloud. Files sync between phone, tablet and computer, maybe not at the pace you might expect. A file stored to iCloud on a MacBook in the hotel room may, or may not, sync to your phone for editing elsewhere. Likewise Microsoft OneDrive works; it is not as smooth as it is at home. That's another aspect of the Great Firewall — it often slows the internet. Perhaps it should not be surprising to learn the Great Firewall blocks WordPress. The blogging site is, in a sense, the 21st-century printing press. China doesn’t have a problem with the WordPress software as such. Many hosted sites there use WordPress. Yet it blocks WordPress.com. It wasn’t possible to post or edit this story in China without a VPN. Even then it was tricky with random disconnects. Protection Banning external sites acts as a form of trade protection. Local alternatives to Facebook, Twitter and Goole thrive without foreign competition. That is only a by-product, China’s real purpose is political or ideological censorship. It stops foreign ideas about democracy and freedom from influencing Chinese citizens. The Great Firewall helps squash internal dissent. It means Chinese users only get to see official, sanctioned news reports. Overseas news reports about, say, Chinese leaders’ questionable personal finances never get an airing. In some ways it may be ineffective. Uncomfortable information and dissent can and do exist with or without an open internet. Yet the Great Firewall highlights the power, reach and sophistication of Chinese government control.

Google has agreed to acquire API management company Apigee Corp. for $625 million. It's a move to help customers securely and stably connect to outside applications and services -- and another step in Google's ongoing efforts to make its cloud platform more attractive to enterprises. API management has become increasingly important to companies such as Workiva, a financial reporting software developer and Google cloud customer based in Ames, Iowa. The company aims to expose more of its Wdesk cloud product to be a more extensible and open platform for managing data, but it has had to do much of that in-house. "Anything we can get to help in the areas of security, monitoring, rate limiting -- all those types of features are really helpful to companies like us to expose more application platforms through APIs," said Dave Tucker, Workiva's vice president of engineering. Workiva looked at an early version of a Google API management suite, Google Cloud Endpoints, but found it to be targeted more at mobile clients and somewhat immature. Apigee, on the other hand, provides important capabilities, such as staging and versioning for releasing APIs in a controlled manner, Tucker said. The timing of the Apigee deal is curious, as Google put a reworked Cloud Endpoints into a beta release just last week, with additional language support and improved performance. It's unclear if or how Google plans to integrate the two services. Google API management leapfrogs AWS API Gateway Security, monitoring, rate limiting -- all those types of features are really helpful to companies like us to expose more application platforms through APIs. Dave Tuckervice president of engineering, Workiva Amazon Web Services (AWS) released its own API management suite, API Gateway, a little over a year ago. Like many AWS offerings early in the release cycle, it has limited functionality. Apigee, on the other hand, has been on the market for years and was ranked as a leader in Gartner's most recent Magic Quadrant for Application Services Governance. "You cannot compare API Gateway with Apigee," said Paolo Malinverno, research vice president at Gartner. "It implements 10% of the functionality of Apigee. You're comparing a shiny new Toyota with a Ferrari." Apigee offers more than API Gateway in a host of areas, including advanced operational polices for API design and analytics, mechanisms for retiring APIs and understanding how to use APIs to add business value, Malinverno said. It also has a sizable list of high-profile customers, including AT&T, Kaiser Permanente, Pitney Bowes, Sears and Walgreens. Many Apigee customers use the technology on premises, so integrating it with Google Cloud Platform and other Google resources will only multiply the potential benefits for customers and allow for improved use cases around internet of things and connections with Android, Malinverno said. "On the surface, it's a big elephant like Google acquiring a little mouse, but the potential is enormous," Malinverno said. Microservices on the horizon With Google's strong support for container-based technologies, it will interesting to see how it implements Apigee to stand up microservices and provide a full-featured API gateway and development portal to its users, said Chris Riley, a founding partner at HKM Consulting LLC in Rochester, Mass. "It's a hell of a lot easier for a singular platform to be the traffic cop," Riley said. "That routing component is really important to the developer who doesn't want to have to worry about all that -- just plug in and go." Google was an early supporter of Docker and offers its own container service on its cloud platform. It also open-sourced Kubernetes, a popular container orchestration tool based on its own internal software. Google said it plans to integrate Kubernetes with Apigee. HKM Consulting is an AWS partner, and Riley works with a client to implement Apigee on premises. One of the reasons potential customers shy away from the service is the high cost, so Google could really expand Apigee's reach if it's able to make it a subscription-based, software-as-a-service offering, Riley said.

A recent Medium post has exposed a Silicon Valley startup for scamming its employees. The startup community response following the post has been a combination of shared experiences and messages of support – so is the behaviour outlined in the article common or a bad actor outlier? Territory wars are brewing among some of the world’s best-known tech giants, as Google gears up to compete with Uber. The Wall Street Journal reported last week that Google will be starting a ride-sharing service of its own, running off the company’s Waze app with the intention of connecting commuters going in the same direction for carpooling. How loyal will people be to Uber when there are serious alternatives on the market? How serious is Google about ridesharing? Tune in as CanCon’s podcast crew – Erin Bury, Managing Director of 88 Creative, Patrick O’Rourke, MobileSyrup Senior Editor, Rob Kenedi, TWG’s Entrepreneur in Residence and host of the amazing #smallrooms podcast, and Douglas Soltys, BetaKit Editor in Chief – prepares for Apple’s next tech release, discusses Google’s foray into the rideshare market, and talks about how many warning signs it should take before you realize your startup is up to no good.

Apple's Siri personal assistant is getting a lot smarter in the upcoming iOS 10, but odds are she'll still sound like a computer. Meanwhile, a subsidiary of Google (her creator's rival) is working on an entirely new model for teaching computers to convert text to speech. It's called WaveNet, and Google says it can mimic any human voice while sounding more natural than text-to-speech algorithms available today. WaveNet is based on research from DeepMind, which this week offered an in-depth look at its efforts to synthesize audio signals for more natural-sounding artificial voices. It all starts with convolutional neural networks, the same technology that powers everything from self-driving cars to disease detection. Neural networks also now power some current text-to-speech products, including Siri, which two years ago was rebuilt to take advantage of this form of machine learning. But Siri and her colleagues, like Google Voice Search or Amazon's Alexa, still use a database of short speech fragments that are strung together to form complete words and sentences. The result is a halting, emotionless voice, even if it is understandable. What if instead of using speech fragments, there was a way to efficiently compile pure audio waveforms? Not only would that allow for more natural-sounding speech, but it would also let the computer mimic virtually any sound, including the ability to faithfully reproduce music. DeepMind engineers set to work. At first, they waged an uphill battle thanks to the inherent density of raw audio, which requires more than 16,000 samples a second for a computer to process. But the engineers were at last able to build a neural network that uses real waveforms from human speakers. They sampled each recording to create a probability distribution of utterances—in essence, teaching the computer how to speak like a human. //Related Articles Things to Ask Siri When You're Bored "Building up samples one step at a time like this is computationally expensive," according to DeepSense, "but we have found it essential for generating complex, realistic-sounding audio." The result is remarkable. DeepSense provided samples of its speech capabilities alongside those typically used today, and the difference in inflection, tone, and emotion is immediately apparent. Have a listen for yourself. It's only natural that computers' speech synthesis will become more, well, natural: Google and its competitors have invested significant resources in developing personal assistants. In order for them to catch on, humans need to think of them less as a gimmick and more as articulate, pleasant robots.

But all of those companies are appearing on stage at BoxWorks in San Francisco, in part because they all work with the cloud storage and content services company in one capacity or another. Box works with Microsoft to integrate its products with Office 365, Amazon to host services in different cloud data centers, and IBM on new applications, services and sales. Google is the newest addition to that club -- the two companies announced Wednesday that they're working on storing Google Docs, Sheets and Slides files inside Box. With companies increasingly turning to cloud services to power their businesses, both in terms of end-user productivity and application development, it's becoming increasingly important for tech firms that compete fiercely with one another to also team up, even in areas where they compete. Box Chief Strategy Officer Jeetu Patel said in an interview that the move towards vendor interoperability is the result of a tectonic shift driven by the rise of cloud computing. "The reality is, you will never buy, in the cloud, everything from a single vendor," he said. "And if you do, that's actually a misguided strategy, because you don't need to have least common denominators, because you can assume that there's interoperability between these platforms." It's a shift in the industry that Box is wholeheartedly focused on. The company recently became the first cloud storage provider to announce support for storing Google Docs files outside of Google's cloud services, just minutes after CEO Aaron Levie extolled his company's partnership with Microsoft. In an interview, he didn't see the two partnerships as mutually exclusive, or hurt by one another. "Just as Microsoft is going to partner with Dropbox and Box when they open up Office, we want to be able to give our customers the same kind of choice," he said. "And it's not a sort of thumb on the nose to Microsoft in any sense, because our job is to be a strong platform, and you can't be a platform if you don't integrate with the apps that your customers are using." All of this is a stark contrast from just a few years ago, when the likes of Microsoft and Google fiercely guarded their vertical stacks. Levie said that partnering broadly is the new normal in enterprise software, as more companies try to serve their customers by working together. "I don't think in the future, you're going to be able to differentiate your products because of either partnerships or because of lock-in," he said. "You're going to differentiate your products because of amazing customer experiences, quality of products, usability and the functionality of the product." The same story is starting to play out on the application development side as well. Different companies are partnering with one another to try and make it easier for developers to cobble together a group of services to build an app. It's still early days for all of these partnerships, many of which were announced in the past year and have only just begun to bear fruit. It'll likely be a matter of years to see how each deal shakes out with the way customers choose to buy services, along with which players stick around in the market. But at least for right now, we're in a brave new world where Microsoft and Google will both partner with a company that directly competes with their products. Go figure.

skip to main | skip to sidebar FOSS Patents This blog covers software patent news and issues with a particular focus on wireless, mobile devices (smartphones, tablet computers). Friday, September 9, 2016 Oracle files proposed notice of deposition of Google witnesses regarding discovery misconduct On August 25, Oracle and Google filed sworn statements (and Oracle also filed an objection) regarding Oracle's motion for an Android-Java copyright re-retrial over alleged discovery misconduct and lies to the jury. Judge Alsup then ordered the parties to respond to each other's filings with new sworn declarations, which were due today. To be of service to loyal readers following the case in detail, I have uploaded Google's declaration as well as Oracle's filing (a declaration as well as a proposed notice of deposition of Google witnesses) to Scribd. Unfortunately, I don't have time, at least at the moment, to analyze these documents in detail and share any observations. However, I don't want this to be misunderstood as my positions on the issues in this case or my belief as to the most likely outcome having changed. So I'd like to explain, just quickly: Due to my focus on two app development projects, my blogging has slowed down massively in recent years. For example, this is only my 36th post this year (with more than two thirds of the year already behind us), while I wrote a minimum of 40 posts in any given month of the year 2012. Some slowdown would obviously have resulted from the fact that many smartphone disputes have been settled, but not to this extent. I'm working very hard right now to launch both games (one on iOS first, the other one on Android and iOS simultaneously) before Thanksgiving weekend. Both games are almost feature-complete, with a lot of the current efforts already relating to final touchup and testing. Both have taken much longer to develop than initially planned, but they've also become even better than I would have predicted at the outset--and those were ambitious projects from the beginning. I have to focus as there still is some hard work on my part to be done, though I have recently stopped doing any coding myself. Now, after six years of "smartphone IP wars," there are only two really big cases pending: this copyright case here and the Apple v. Samsung design patent matter. As a right holder who has already invested a huge amount of money as well as "sweat equity" in software development, I care very much about Oracle v. Google, which is no longer really about APIs as much as it is about software copyright in general. As a potential future defendant against trolls, I'm deeply concerned about the prospect of an unapportioned disgorgement of profits over a design patent on a single icon or whatever other design. The Supreme Court will hear Samsung's appeal in a month (one month and two days, to be precise). This is obviously not the time to reduce or discontinue my coverage of that matter. It will be over soon. I guess the decision will even come down before Christmas, or in January maybe. By contrast, Oracle v. Google will take much longer. I honestly can't predict how much time I'll find to comment on it. It could be that I'll somehow manage to find the time to blog about it like in the past, especially because I disagree with 99% of everything else I read about that case, but it could also be that my next post on this case after this one will be my commentary on the final outcome after a settlement or after all appeals have been exhausted. Or anything in between those extremes. Whatever it may be, it has nothing to do with how important this matter is to software developers like me or with what I believe the legally and factually correct outcome should be.

British company DeepMind, which Google acquired for about $533 million in 2014, developed an artificial intelligence called WaveNet that can mimic human speech by learning how to form the individual sound waves a human voice creates, it said in a blog post Friday. In blind tests for U.S. English and Mandarin Chinese, human listeners found WaveNet-generated speech sounded more natural than that created with any of Google’s existing text-to-speech programs, which are based on different technology. However, WaveNet underperformed recordings of actual human speech. Many computer-generated speech programs work by using a large data set of short recordings of a single human speaker, then combining these speech fragments to form new words. The result is intelligible and sounds human, if not completely natural. The drawback is that the sound of the voice cannot be easily modified. Other systems form the voice completely electronically, usually based on rules about how the certain letter-combinations are pronounced. These systems allow the sound of the voice to be manipulated easily, but they have tended to sound less natural than computer-generated speech based on recordings of humans, DeepMind said. WaveNet is a type of AI called a neural network that is designed to mimic how parts of the human brain function. Such networks need to be trained with large data sets. WaveNet won’t have immediate commercial applications because the system requires too much computational power: it has to sample the audio signal it is being trained on 16,000 times per second or more, DeepMind said. And then for each of those samples it has to form a prediction about what the soundwave should look like based on each of the prior samples. Even the DeepMind researchers acknowledged in their blog post that this “is a clearly challenging task.” Still, tech companies are likely to pay close attention to DeepMind’s breakthrough. Speech is becoming an increasingly important way humans interact with everything from mobile phones to cars. Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and Google have all invested in personal digital assistants that primarily interact with users through speech. Mark Bennett, the international director of Google Play, which sells Android apps, told an Android developer conference in London recently that 20 percent of mobile searches using Google are made by voice, not written text. And while researchers have made great strides in getting computers to understand spoken language, their ability to talk back in ways that seem fully human has lagged. WaveNet is yet another coup for DeepMind, which is best known for creating AlphaGo, an AI system that beat the world’s top ranked human player in the strategy game Go this year. Still, Google has disclosed little about how DeepMind’s research has helped it commercially, although the company has revealed that it has used DeepMind’s technology to reduce the power demands of its data centers by 40 percent, saving enough money to justify the amount Google spent to buy the London AI company. It has also said that DeepMind has helped achieve “substantial improvements to a set of services from YouTube and Google Play to Google’s advertising products.” Jeremy Kahn is a Bloomberg writer.

But what's missing grabbed most of the attention: the headphone jack. On The Late Show, host Stephen Colbert delivered a parody of Wednesday's release, dressed in the style of Apple CEO Tim Cook, in an untucked dark-blue shirt. He took away not just the headphone jack but also the home button, the glass front -- and the back. "We thought, if less is more how much more could we less?" he said. Apple's all-too-serious move to remove the connection to its iconic white earbuds and urge people to use cordless AirPods -- sold separately for $159 -- points to the company's vision of a "wireless future," which could someday extend to home appliances, cars and more. There was other news: Nintendo's Super Mario is coming to the App Store, and you can be part of the Pokémon Go scavenger hunt on a revamped Apple Watch. It was a consumer tech show for sure, with no mention of business. But CIOs should take notice. Even though its iPhone sales have flagged recently, Apple still sells big to consumers -- and those who buy also go to work. "CIOs would be best served by paying attention to what kind of technology their employees like and prefer to use," said Christopher Voce, an analyst at Forrester Research. "But most important, focusing on how mobile can help them, because the business impact is undeniable." Apple-to-apples comparison Irwin Lazar, an analyst at Nemertes Research, said CIOs should think about the new iPhone 7 features and other Apple announcements in digital-transformation terms: "What can we deliver to mobile devices both internally and externally?" he said. The Apple Watch, for example, which comes with a faster, dual-core processor, might be able to run business applications that couldn't be run before. And apps may require tweaking to offer what the new phone has. "If I'm delivering an application that allows people to take pictures of something," Lazar said of a CIO, he or she should "make sure that I can support the enhancement that the camera provides." Overall though, the tweaks Apple introduced were incremental, Lazar said, and won't have as big a business impact as the release of the new mobile operating system, iOS 10. The new version, which will be released Sept. 13, will work with third-party applications like corporate phone systems from Cisco or Microsoft, making it easier for workers to make business calls from their personal devices. Hefty, hefty iPhone 7 But some of the tweaks Apple was proudest of, like the iPhone 7's new "ruggedized" exterior, could prove beneficial in a number of contexts, Voce said, including retail and air travel -- and it will compete well with efforts rivals like Samsung have been doing to make their devices tougher and more resilient to drops and bad weather. "There are scenarios where organizations might use devices in less-than-ideal conditions," he said. "You get on a flight nowadays -- every flight attendant is going to have a mobile device, and it usually has been ruggedized to a certain extent." Apple also debuted real-time collaboration capabilities in its iWork productivity suite -- which includes word processing, presentation and spreadsheet applications. The new feature will allow people working on the same project to contribute images, text or graphics. That may seem like Apple wants a piece of the market segment dominated now by Microsoft, with its Office suite, and to a lesser extent Google, with its cloud-based Apps for Work. But its impact will be primarily in education, not business, Voce said. Making inroads in business would be "extraordinarily difficult." Lazar's forecast: "Most people won't be using iWork in a business context." 'Increased competition' The Apple rollouts may have another, less-direct effect on business, Voce said: It may very likely trigger industry-wide change. The company has "spurred an intensity" in the tech market, Voce said, pushing Microsoft to make its Surface tablet offering easier to use, for example, and Dell to improve its XPS computer line. "What you've seen is that kind of focus on experience has driven the whole industry to raise their game," Voce said. "And as consumers and employees, we benefit. Apple led that charge and the benefit is increased competition." CIO news roundup for week of Sept. 5 The iPhone 7 and other Apple upgrades prevailed in the news this week. Here's what else made headlines: HPE is slimming down. Hewlett Packard Enterprise will spin off and merge its non-core software assets with UK-based technology firm Micro Focus in a deal valued at $8.8 billion, HPE said Wednesday. "With today's announcement, we are taking another important step in achieving the vision of creating a faster-growing, higher-margin, stronger cash flow company well-positioned for our customers and for the future," Meg Whitman, president and CEO, said in a press release. HPE's non-core software assets -- Application Delivery Management, Big Data, Enterprise Security, Information Management & Governance and IT Operations Management -- will combine with Micro Focus' portfolio to help drive software innovation and create a "pure-play" software company, according to the release. HPE shareholders will have a 50.1% ownership of the merged company, and Micro Focus will pay $2.5 billion in cash to HPE. This follows the announcement in May that HPE would merge its IT services business with Computer Sciences Corp. Google plans to acquire Apigee. The search giant said it is set to acquire San Jose, Calif., API management provider Apigee for $625 million. Application programming interfaces (APIs) are used by developers to interface and integrate with outside applications and services, and "the addition of Apigee's API solutions to Google cloud will accelerate our customers' move to supporting their businesses with high-quality digital interactions," said Diane Greene, senior vice president for Google Cloud services, in a blog post. The deal is expected to close by end of this year. Apigee was founded in 2004 as Sonoa Systems, and the company went public in 2015. Its customers include Walgreens, AT&T, Burberry and Live Nation. In other Google news, the company announced its partnership with Box on Wednesday. Intel boosts computer vision strategy. In an effort to bolster its RealSense platform, chip maker Intel is acquiring computer vision startup Movidius, Intel announced Monday. Movidius designs system-on-a-chip (SoC) products, and its low-power and high-performance SoC platforms will help accelerate Intel's computer vision applications, said Josh Walden, senior vice president and general manager at Intel's New Technology Group, in a blog post. "This acquisition brings algorithms tuned for deep learning, depth processing, navigation and mapping, and natural interactions ... and machine intelligence," Walden wrote. Intel will deploy Movidius' vision chip technology in devices like drones and robots, and use it to improve augmented, virtual and merged reality technologies. Mobile device infections on the rise. Smartphones accounted for 78% of infections detected in mobile networks during the first half of 2016, according to a new report by the Finnish mobile phone company Nokia. The report's data was aggregated across the networks where the Nokia NetGuard Endpoint Security solution is deployed. The report found that the smartphone infection rate rose 96% between January and July this year when compared with the second half of 2015. The mobile infections hit an all-time high in April, with malware affecting one out of every 120 smartphones, the report states. Android devices where the most targeted, accounting for 74% of all mobile malware infections. The Nokia Threat Intelligence Report - H1 2016 identified Uapush.A, Kasandra.B and SMSTracker as the top three mobile malware threats, accounting for 47% of all infections.

Add My Comment Cancel   [-] abuell - 10 Sep 2016 7:06 PM I found it interesting that there's some controversy around Apple removing the headphone jack on the iPhone 7. Accusing them of benefiting through the move which could spur more sales of Beats. If you don't like it, there's a easy solution to that: don't spend $650+ on an iPhone. That's just foolishness.  Add My Comment Cancel   [-] ncberns - 12 Sep 2016 8:18 AM News of the non-jack has been unavoidable. Of course if buyers are willing to drop almost a $1000 for a new phone they really don't need, an extra $150 for a new headset (they also don't need) won't mean much. What say we all stand by while Apple dukes it out with all the pro-jack folks until there's a clear winner of this tempest in a teapot "advance".  Add My Comment Cancel   [-] AlbertGareev - 12 Sep 2016 4:40 PM I actually find the news in the absence of truly innovative advances from Apple - for quite a while. Another disappointment is due to a gradual degradation of iOS based software quality. Crashing apps slowly become a norm.

X EU plans to protect news publishers’ online copyright Draft directive aims to safeguard news organisations and journalists from piracy Sat, Sep 10, 2016, 01:00 Peter Murtagh A new EU directive on online copyright may meet resistance from Google. File photograph: David Paul Morris/Getty Images         News organisations that generate original content will be protected by copyright against information aggregators, as well as unscrupulous online providers who base their service on pirated information, if proposals from the European Commission become law. The proposals are contained in a draft directive that seeks to update an earlier one, Copyright in the EU Digital Single Market, from 2001. The new directive, a late draft of which has been obtained by The Irish Times, proposes to, in effect, give to news publishers the degree of copyright protection that was afforded to authors, performers, the music industry, film-makers and broadcasters in the 2001 directive. The proposal is part of the so-called digital single market strategy that commission president Jean-Claude Juncker has made a priority of his administration. The commission vice-president with responsibility for this area, Andrus Ansip, was in Dublin this week meeting the Taoiseach, Enda Kenny, and the Dáil’s European affairs committee. The new directive is likely to meet stiff resistance from Google, whose Google News service relies wholly on reproducing information gathered, processed and published initially by news organisations, and by Facebook which sees itself as the world’s information platform but is also based on information originated by others. “There’s going to be a huge pushback from Google and other online platforms, such as news aggregation sites,” predicted Chris Mehigan, a Brussels-based public affairs consultant with Hume Brophy public relations consultants. RTÉ and TG4 need funding increases, says Minister Media pluralism The new directive is an attempt to protect the business viability of news organisations, and also the work of journalists, in the interests of media pluralism and, ultimately, the information available to citizens of EU member states. In an explanatory memorandum to the draft directive, the commission notes that the internet has become “the main marketplace for the distribution and access to copyright-protected content”. However, news media copyright holders “face difficulties when seeking to licence their rights and be remunerated for the online distribution of their works”. ADVERTISEMENT It continues: “This could put at risk the development of European creativity and production of creative content. “It is therefore necessary to guarantee that authors and rightholders receive a fair share of the value that is generated by the use of their work and other subject matter. “News publishers are facing difficulties in licensing their publications online and obtaining a fair share of the value they generate. This could ultimately affect citizens’ access to information. “This proposal provides for a new right for news publishers aiming at facilitating online licensing of their publications, the recouping of their investment and the online enforcement of their rights.” The directive says that news publishers will have the same rights as granted to others in the 2001 directive “for the online use of their news organisations”. Cease service A measure to this effect already introduced by the Spanish government prompted Google to cease its news service for the Spanish market two years ago rather than pay the news organisations there whose content Google proposed to republish. For newspaper publishers watching helplessly as others pirate their material, the draft directive may not be quite the panacea for which they have longed. This is because the new directive also embraces the exceptions and limitations outlined in the 2001 directive. That directive says copyright may not apply in some circumstances to the reproduction of material “as long as the source, including the author’s name, is indicated, or use of works or other subject matter in connection with the reporting of current events”. The draft new directive sets out to establish an important principle, says Mehigan: “If you put a piece up on a news site, especially the work of a columnist, an opinion piece, a piece of substantial original work such as a feature, an interview or an investigation, you have the sole rights of reproduction.” If the draft directive is signed off by the commission on September 21st, it will then go through the European Parliament and the council of relevant ministers from member states where it can be amended and is likely to be the subject of intense lobbying by vested interests.       Topics: Chris Mehigan European Commission European Parliament European Union News organisations Facebook Google Hume Brophy Dublin(IE) Read More News publishers could charge search engines for story extracts Content ‘explosion’ a key focus at MediaCon summit INM talk not of media diversity, but of industry consolidation Independent News & Media acquires six regional newspaper titles Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Criminal Court Gardaí arrived at scene after frenzied attack with ‘boning knife’ Opinion Kathy Sheridan: What can liberals learn from the US election?

The DeepMind unit, which Google bought in 2014 for roughly $533 million, develops supercomputers and artificial intelligence (AI). One of the AI programs DeepMind has developed is Wavenet, designed to mimic human speech.  © Photo: Pixabay Hello Monsters, Goodbye Privacy! Google Maps Timeline and Pokemon Go Pally Up In blind tests human listeners indicated that Wavenet was the most natural sounding text-to-speech (TTS) program, after hearing samples from different programs in English and Mandarin Chinese. TTS programs continue to struggle to sound like natural speech, and Wavenet, while increasingly similar, does not yet sound just like actual human speech. Wavenet simulates certain brain functions by using what in artificial intelligence is called a "neural network." DeepMind has reported that Wavenet is not currently available to purchase as the processing power required to sample an audio signal some 16,000 times per second remains impractical at the consumer level.  Once the signal is sampled, it must predict what each soundwave should look like based on prior samples. In a blog post, DeepMind researchers admit that the undertaking "is a clearly challenging task."  © AFP 2016/ Can Google Tip the Scales on the US Presidential Election Without Anyone Knowing? As people increasingly use speech to interface with technology, from cars to mobile phones, other tech companies are taking note of DeepMind’s advancements. Apple, Microsoft, Google-parent Alphabet, and Amazon already communicate using speech-based digital personal assistants. At a London developer conference last week, Google Play’s international director, Mike Bennett, revealed that speech commands make up 20 percent of Google searches, as opposed to text searches. Google acknowledged that it has used DeepMind to drop the power demands of its data centers by 40 percent, but has not said much about how the program has impacted the company commercially, if at all. The company has also stated that the AI has made "substantial improvements to a set of services from YouTube and Google Play to Google’s advertising products." Before developing Wavenet, Google also made strides in AI with the AlphaGo program, which was able to beat Lee Sedol, the world’s best player of strategy game Go.  ...

Instead of a placard with his name, the sign outside the office he leads says “Rebel Alliance.” With its open rows of Apple computers, whiteboards and “Star Wars” imagery lining the walls, Lynch’s free-flow work space at the Pentagon’s Defense Digital Service would be familiar to Silicon Valley programmers. But it’s atypical for federal agencies, and that’s the point. “It’s the fight against the bureaucracy,” said Lynch, 40, who founded several technology startups. “How do we think of new approaches to things that in some ways have remained unchanged for very long?” While the Defense Department has to fend off North Korean and Russian hackers and counter Islamic State recruiters online, it also has to process personnel requests, travel vouchers and job applications more efficiently. Defense Secretary Ash Carter has vowed to yank the Pentagon fully into the 21st century — moving increasingly toward cloud services, modernizing computer systems and adding more mobile products. Lynch, whose office reports directly to Carter, helps make that happen. Part of Lynch’s new approach meant landing Matt Cutts, a 15-year veteran at Google who, as the head of the company’s Web spam team, had the power to help determine whether companies flourished or foundered by tweaking the algorithm behind online search results. Cutts’ role at Google — he’s now on leave — was important enough to the world of webmasters, public relations specialists and computer engineers that he attracted 516,000 followers on Twitter, 80,000 more than Vladimir Putin’s English feed. “I did take a pay cut, but that’s OK, because where else do you get a chance to have an impact like this?” the 44-year-old said. Because it’s the Pentagon, not everything Cutts and Lynch do can even be discussed publicly. But among the Defense Digital Service’s unclassified projects is a review of problems affecting the new ground-control system for the next generation of GPS satellites as well as veterans’ health-care records and the Defense Department’s travel system. With their set pay scales and buttoned-down culture, the Pentagon and other public agencies must compete for talent with tech companies offering lucrative salaries and laid-back work environments. Their longer hiring process is also a turnoff. And then there’s the broad distrust of Washington in Silicon Valley. FBI Director James Comey said his daughter encapsulated the government’s problems in recruiting, describing his role as “The Man.” “And I thought that was a compliment so I said, ‘Thank you,’ ” Comey told attendees at a Symantec Corp. cybersecurity conference Aug. 30. “And she said, ‘Dad, I don’t mean that in a good way. I mean, you’re The Man. Who would want to work for The Man?’ “ It all adds up to a high hurdle for the feds. “Federal agencies’ lack of cybersecurity and IT talent is a major resource constraint that impacts their ability to protect information and assets,” U.S. Chief Information Officer Tony Scott and other Obama administration officials said in a July statement. Some of that shortfall starts with the paycheck. Cybersecurity and information technology workers usually enter the federal government at salaries from $53,000 to $84,000, according to the Office of Personnel Management. That compares with average cybersecurity salaries of $116,000 at Google and $140,000 at Facebook, according to Glassdoor Inc., which tracks company pay. Plus, companies offer additional perks, from free snacks to stock options. The U.S. Digital Service, which brings in technologists for short-term programs at federal agencies, points out to recruits that federal salaries are capped at $160,300. “Sooner or later the federal government, if they’re going to get people, they’re going to have to pay higher salaries,” said Martin Libicki, a senior management scientist at Rand Corp. who wrote a report on the cyber workforce. “But that means more taxpayer money.” The demand for cybersecurity professionals began to overtake supply in 2007, and the shortage is primarily among those with high-end skills, who can fetch salaries of $200,000 to $250,000, according to Libicki.

Like other projects from the Mountain View company’s health tech unit, Onduo is short on specifics. It promises to develop consumer software and biometric devices to help tackle a health crisis that is expected to afflict 592 million people worldwide by 2035, according to the International Diabetes Federation. “What we’re trying to do here is really follow a process which ... will create products to help people living with diabetes manage their care,” Dr. Joshua Riff, Onduo’s newly appointed CEO, in an interview before Sunday evening’s official launch of the independent company. The name — Onduo — is a melding of the words “on,” as in moving forward, and “duo,” as in “two” or partnership. Riff said the name could have several meanings, but captures the concept of partnership as well as the spirit of working with patients. One of Onduo’s first health partners is Sutter Health, the large hospital network from Sacramento that provides care throughout Northern California. Sutter will work with Verily and Onduo to conduct studies as well as testing. Chris Waugh, Sutter Health’s chief innovation officer, said the collaboration will help the hospital system develop “incredibly personal care options” for patients. “Because our integrated network focuses on Northern California, where we care for one of the most diverse populations in the world, we offer partners like Onduo the unique opportunity to work with us to test treatments and tools in various care settings that can influence the care for people of all races and ethnicities,” Waugh said in an email. Verily, which was hatched from Google’s X lab for ambitious projects and is now under the umbrella of Alphabet, has worked with other large drugmakers including Johnson & Johnson, on developing medical robots, and GlaxoSmithKline, to create implants that could ultimately replace drugs by generating electrical pulses to help the body heal itself. The new life sciences unit has been criticized for having goals that are pie-in-the-sky rather than practical, but Onduo’s Riff said his company wants to create solutions. He said he’s focusing on what people need rather than when the company could rush something to market. “The question is going to be what can we bring to market that can have the greatest impact on people with diabetes,” he said. “That’s very different thinking than is seen in a traditional health care company.” Coming from working as an emergency physician and later running the health plan for Target, Riff said he saw the devastation of uncontrolled diabetes and understood the challenges of changing behavior. “As a physician, I’d spend my day telling people what I want them to do,” he said. “That may last a short period of time, but what we need to do is ask what consumers ... what can we do to make their lives easier?” Initially, Onduo will focus on Type 2 diabetes, which is linked to obesity, family history and lifestyle habits, by developing approaches that could help people make better decisions about their health, improving medication management. Over time, the company plans to expand its focus to include Type 1 diabetes, the form in which the body attacks the insulin-producing cells of the pancreas. Sanofi, which also has a newly created diabetes unit focusing on developing therapies, has invested about $248 million into the joint venture. Onduo’s Riff says only that Verily is making an “equivalent capital investment.” The joint venture is based in Kendall Square in Cambridge, Mass.

ITProPortal Search RSS News Features Analysis Guides Reviews Categories Business Hardware Security Software Mobile Enterprise Cloud Networks Public Sector Startups Web Business intelligence, advanced analytics & data science: Make the right choice By Jay Patani Shares Do you ever feel adrift in a sea of buzzwords? Between the hundred Clouds on the horizon, the code ‘jedi’ you’re trying to hire and the blockchain disruptors leaking out of the incubator that you haven’t quite figured out yet, does it ever feel like a bit much to take in? I thought so. And if your business is serious about data, there’s probably three that crop up time and again with only blurred definitions and vague marketing spiel to distinguish between them: business intelligence, business analytics and data science. They may sound like much of a muchness, but there are real differences, and it’s important for businesses to pick the approach that best suits their needs. So: what are the business tools behind the buzzwords?   Business Intelligence (BI)   Business objectives: BI software is tasked with developing a set of key metrics to describe the past (not prescribe the future). It’s looking in the rear view mirror to answer questions such as, ‘what happened?’ and, ‘by how much?’ Though limited in analytical functionality, BI systems – when used successfully – optimise commercial or technical performance and streamline daily business operations. Target user: Non-technical Analyst, Business Management Technical sophistication: Low-Medium BI software usually has limited analytical complexity yet often has powerful reporting and rich visualisation functionality. Reporting can range from highly granular metrics to higher level business reports. Popularity: According to Google Trends, searches for Business Intelligence have been declining over time. Business/Data Analytics (BA)   Business objectives: BA seeks to answer the, ‘why?’ and, ‘what will happen in the future?’ Rather than only looking backwards, analytics help businesses answer more strategic questions in addition to day-to-day operational ones such as, ‘who are my most valuable customers?’ or, ‘what is the 6-month business forecast?’ Business analytics also allows users to query data and answer ad-hoc questions, which is not usually possible in traditional BI software. Target user: Business user, Data Analyst, Data Scientist Technical sophistication: Medium-High. Business Analytics will usually aggregate, enrich and analyse data – both unstructured and structured. Beyond simply collecting the data, advanced analytics can identify correlations between different (often siloed) sources of data and use machine learning to spot patterns, build models and make predictions. Business Analytics introduces a higher level of statistical capabilities, data mining and predictive analytics to the more reporting-oriented Business Intelligence. Similar to BI, Business Analytics is in the form of a software platform designed to operate across teams and users in an organisation. A key objective of an analytics solution should be to democratise access to data and insights in an organisation – to allow non-technical users to manipulate data in sophisticated ways. Popularity: According to Google Trends, searches for Business Analytics have been increasing over time.   Data Science Business objectives: Data scientists are often tasked with specific briefs such as to find the most valuable customers or predict churn – let’s call these the ‘known unknowns’. But they may also engage in data mining – to discover the ‘unknown unknowns’ that the business may otherwise not have found. Target user: Data Scientist / Data engineer Technical sophistication: High. While business intelligence and business analytics provide a software platform to view data and automate or reproduce analyses, data science requires more technically skilled professionals to use a variety of tools (many of which are open source) to answer complex business questions. Data scientists are able to use the latest big data techniques in machine learning, natural language processing, image processing or neural networks to extract ‘hidden’ insight from the vast pool of data that businesses may have amassed as well as acquire new valuable sources of data. A good data scientist is a rare breed and as a result often difficult (and expensive) to hire; they should combine domain knowledge in the industry with both statistical and programming skills. So as interest (as measured by Google Trends) in business intelligence has waned, appetite for business analytics and data science capabilities has increased. This may be partly down to greater industry knowledge about the more mature concept (meaning less need to Google it), but surely also due to businesses discovering they can do more with data than they ever could before.    The resounding winners in today’s data landscape are business/data analytics and data science. Whilst these areas overlap significantly, they approach big data in different ways. Advanced Data Analytics is often a more cost-effective way to automate and democratise data discovery and analysis using tried-and-tested techniques, whereas data science is more about finding new ways of analysing data by creating and deploying algorithms. The virtue of data analytics is that it can be easily integrated into a company’s existing operations and architecture. What we will see in the future is further union between data science and analytics – more analytics software will adopt and absorb the latest data science innovations so that these tools, which were once only at the disposal of PhD-whizzes, can be in the hands of non-technical business users. Ultimately, the right choice for a given business is a tool that is adaptable and able to move dynamically with changing business demands and new technologies. It’s important that anyone can access useful analysis to help them in their roles and this isn’t just kept to the select few as data becomes central to more and more areas of every business.

MintTwist Menu Skip to content Home Archive Guest post Friday 5th March 2010 by Danny Ball Google and Microsoft enter Translation Wars Right now there is a titanic battle occurring, but not over land, politics, religion or money. In the 21st century two of the world’s largest and most influential companies are going toe to toe. It has often been said in the past ‘to the victor goes the spoils’. The winner of this battle will win something that may seem like nothing but has become increasingly important in recent years, our time and eyes. Google and Microsoft are arguably two of the biggest companies in the world and they make money with our time and clicking mice. The price we as users pay is to have to put up with a few adverts on your screen, which is a small inconvenience for the vast majority of people, who are for the most part quite apathetic. The most important thing users want is a good service and for it to be free. Have you ever considered the difficulty language can play in the world of business and politics? Consider the United Nations for a moment and the cost of translators and interpreters. If the United Nations wants to send all 196 of its members a memo it would take an age to do it each countries native language. As a result the six official languages of the United Nations, used in intergovernmental meetings and documents, are Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian, and Spanish. The United Nations Editorial Manual states that the standard for English language documents is British usage and Oxford spelling, the Chinese writing standard is Simplified Chinese. These six different languages will make the organisation of the UN hard enough, but there are still so many languages out there. Perhaps it would be best if there was a machine on the internet that could translate any document from one language to another, which brings us back to the raging virtual battlefield. Google, Microsoft and Yahoo are all competing for that coveted title, best online translation machine. There are however a couple of factors which will prevent anyone ever achieving the perfect online translation machine. The first and most important point which will remain part of language forever and what makes it so special is that it is constantly changing and evolving, as is the way we use language. Another key factor is that the smallest mistake can make the biggest difference. Grammar is the organisation of words and if the grammar is wrong the words don’t make sense. To get a better understanding of the different translations machines research was carried out on Bing Translator, Google Translate and Yahoo’s Babel Fish. The same phrase was typed into each machine and the results were analysed for accuracy. In conclusion the different translation engines had different results to one another and none were completely accurate. Each translation has its peculiarities, certainly, and this comparison isn’t intended to show that one machine translation service is better. What this demonstrates is that if you need something translated and you want it to be accurate and professional, you would be much wiser using a specialist translation agency.

No single company is perfect, but together they show what the corporate ideal could look like. The platonic ideal “We are at our best when we draw on the talents of all parts of our society, and our greatest accomplishments are achieved when diverse perspectives are brought to bear to overcome our greatest challenges.” —Barack Obama in 2011 The practice Genevieve Bell, who’s been at Intel since 1998, was running late for her call, so she quickly ducked into the gender-neutral bathroom at the company’s Santa Clara, California, headquarters before plopping herself down on the floor to dial in. “Intel today feels like a profoundly different company than I was at even five years ago,” says Bell, a cultural anthropologist, senior fellow, and vice president at Intel.  “I had at least one boss who told me my career would be much better if I stopped talking about diversity. I survived, and he didn’t.”  These days, it seems almost every major tech company in Silicon Valley has publicly committed to building a more diverse workforce. But it’s a topic Bell, a self-described radical feminist, has been thinking about since she first arrived at the company 18 years ago. “I had at least one boss who told me my career would be much better if I stopped talking about diversity,” says Bell. She was one of the first social scientists hired by Intel to conduct field work to understand what women and people in the “rest of world” (a term she hates) want from technology. “I survived, and he didn’t.” Like its peers, Intel is overwhelmingly male, white, and Asian, and the diversity problem is a particularly tough one to tackle because 85% of its 100,000 or so employees are in technical roles, which is where the industry’s efforts to improve diversity have largely stalled. “They really have to make a dent on the technical side,” says Elizabeth Ames, a senior vice president at the Anita Borg Institute, which advocates on behalf of women in technology. “I think it’s really impressive that Intel is not only making this dent, but they are continuing to sustain it.” Since 2000, long before companies like Google and Facebook began releasing their diversity stats, Intel made its EEO-1 reports, which are filed with the US government and break down staff race and gender across all ranks, publicly available. Transparency was a good first step, and key to holding the company accountable, but it alone wasn’t enough. To show it was really committed to the cause, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich went on stage at the 2015 International Consumer Electronics Show (CES), arguably the biggest tech convention of the year, to proclaim the company would reach full representation—meaning the makeup of its staff would mirror market availability across different types of roles—by 2020. This aspiration might seem basic, but it’s rare for a tech company to set specific, measurable goals. While full representation is also a realistic goal, it’s proved largely out of reach for the tech industry. According to Intel’s market availability data, women make up 22.7% of available talent for technical roles while Hispanics and African Americans comprise 8.4% and 4.5%, respectively. At Facebook and Alphabet, Google’s parent company, for example, Hispanics and blacks make up 3% and 1%, respectively, of technical roles. Women comprise 17% of tech staff at Facebook and 19% at Alphabet. “It’s time to step up and do more,” Krzanich declared in his keynote address. “It’s not good enough to say we value diversity.” He said Intel would commit $300 million to invest in startups created by women and underrepresented minorities, help define computer science curriculum at high schools, offer internships to diverse students, and send Intel employees to schools to mentor minority students.  “It’s time to step up and do more.”  This was in addition to Intel’s other initiatives to recruit, retain, and promote diverse employees. This year the company started requiring managers to interview a diverse slate of candidates for open roles, and for a diverse group of employees to interview job candidates. The company doesn’t mandate specific quotas, but continues to emphasize diversity with hiring managers and will enlist the help of recruiters to fill these slates too. Intel also runs a “pay it forward” program that identifies and connects promising employees with mentors within the company who help groom them into leaders. “I’m a product of the sponsorship protege program,” says Sandra Lopez, vice president of Intel’s new devices group and member of Intel’s Hispanic Leadership Council. “I had a sponsor, and she helped me understand what I needed to do to be a leader and grow and develop. As a result, I became a VP.” It’s a common refrain for tech companies to attribute their lack of diversity to the “pipeline problem,” the notion that there aren’t enough qualified women and minorities to recruit from. Intel, however, believes it can approach the diversity problem from a variety of angles, including keeping its existing employees. “I always say if you just focus on hiring and everyone’s [headed] toward the door, it’s a zero-sum game,” remarks Danielle Brown, Intel’s chief diversity and inclusion officer. To retain its employees, Intel has worked to build a welcoming work environment, one where employees feel there are opportunities to grow their careers. One attempt to do so is a program called Rapid Orientation for Accelerated Results (ROAR), which brings new hires to headquarters for a week to meet with company leaders and attend workshops on career development. Intel believes there’s a ripple effect in promoting diverse employees to managerial roles, who are likely to attract, hire, and mentor other women and underrepresented minorities. A company blog post on Intel’s internal blog. (Intel) “I think we’re all impatient for change to happen quickly.”  When the company first started the program in 2015, it was available only to women. But this year, Intel opened ROAR to diverse hires, which Brown says is key to achieving Intel’s diversity goals. “If we made the choice to be exclusive instead of inclusive, it wouldn’t be received very well,” she adds. “We truly believe for this to work you have to take the inclusive approach.” This same approach has been taken with other initiatives as well, tested first with a smaller group, such as new hires within the last year, before opening it up to more employees. The takeaways While progress is slow, according to Intel’s most recent diversity report released Aug. 10, women now make up 25% of the company’s US employees and 21% of technical staff in the US. In addition, underrepresented minorities comprise 12% of its US employees and technical employees. In the first half of 2016, however, Intel saw a slight decline in the percentage of women and underrepresented minorities in their early careers. The company explains this is a result of a shift in focus from PCs to the cloud and connected devices, which led to fluctuations in its hiring numbers and increases in people leaving the company. But the company insists it’s still committed to its goal of full representation by 2020. In Silicon Valley, where cars drive themselves and marijuana shows up an hour after it’s ordered, diversity has proven to be a problem with no easy solution. Intel knows there’s more than just the pipeline problem, which it’s committed to fixing. To grow and maintain diversity, it’s also working to keep existing staff happy and getting all employees—not just the underrepresented—on board with the company’s goals. “This is big, big culture change,” says Brown. “It’s really changing the way a company practices hiring, how they think about internal movement and development, how they think about retention. Those changes take time, and I think we’re all impatient for change to happen quickly.” Read full story home our picks popular latest obsessions search

Twitter Facebook Instagram News Comment Features Arts Science Sports Photo Video Magazine YouTube Space opens in Toronto Sets featuring table hockey and moose antlers work to reflect the Canadian experience By Gabrielle Warren on September 11, 2016 By Gabrielle Warren Published: 2:26 pm, 11 September 2016 Modified: 5:30 pm, 11 September 2016 under Arts & Culture Tags: Technology, Toronto, YouTube The YouTube Space is available to users with 10,000 subscribers or more. NATHAN CHAN/THE VARSTIY http://var.st/1o8 The YouTube Space is available to users with 10,000 subscribers or more. NATHAN CHAN/THE VARSTIY Google has opened their first YouTube office in Canada, located at George Brown College.YouTube Spaces were created in April to help grow and support YouTube channels through educational and technical services. According to Chris D’Angelo, global head of production and programming for YouTube Spaces, “the goal of YouTube Spaces is to help create better storytellers and allow YouTubers to make the most out of the video-sharing platform.” Adam Relles, head of the YouTube space in New York City and an instrumental figure in opening the space in Toronto, explains, “You look at Toronto, and it’s a city that has its own culture and history of impact on creative — things like The Second City, and Kids in the Hall, and tonnes of music like Drake and The Weeknd… So, there is a significant influence.” With the rise of Canadian YouTubers like JusReign, AsapSCIENCE, The Sorry Girls, Superwoman, and LaurDIY, it makes sense that Google would install an office in Canada, making a total of eight locations around the world. The 3,500 square foot space is open to all YouTubers with over 10,000 subscribers. Once a YouTube content creator attains 10,000 subscribers, they are invited to an “Unlock the Space” orientation seminar designed to familiarize them with the environment and its capabilities. These capabilities include high-quality camera equipment, sound stages, special production programs, educational offerings, exclusive events, and screenings. The space itself has a unique Toronto feel with contributions from design students at George Brown College. Each set in the space is inspired by different aspects of Canadiana. From the graffiti-mural by Toronto artist Runt, to the cottage rec-room including moose antlers and table hockey, each space reflects different parts of the Canadian experience. Although exclusive benefits are limited to individuals with over 10,000 subscribers, access to the Space’s Online Creator Academy and Open Houses are available for anyone with a YouTube channel.

The search giant has said that when the next version of Chrome launches, it will begin displaying a new warning on any login pages that aren’t encrypted, or in other words using HTTP. This is scheduled to start in January 2017 with the rollout of Chrome 56. This “not secure” warnings will be displayed in password and credit card fields on said webpages, as well as in a window alongside the address bar. To start off with, the words “not secure” will appear next to the address of unencrypted sites, but in the future they will also be labeled with a red triangle symbol, designed to steer users away from the pages. A post on Google’s security blog explains that sites still using HTTP are a risk because “someone else on the network can look at or modify the site before it gets to you.” Login or payment pages that are unencrypted are even more dangerous, as an attacker can easily intercept the submitted information as it moves across the network. The need for such bright and clear labeling is interesting, as Google notes that users often don’t notice a lack of a “secure” icon or message as a warning. “Chrome currently indicates HTTP connections with a neutral indicator,” Chrome Security Team’s Emily Schechter writes. “This doesn’t reflect the true lack of security for HTTP connections.” SOURCE Google Story Timeline WhatsApp still isn't as secure as you might think Google Chrome puts Flash to pasture starting next month Gmail's new security warnings make your email safer iPhone patent will collect thieves’ fingerprint, photo, data Chromebooks might sport fingerprint scanners soon Tags browserChromeEncryptiongoogleInternetsecurity Must Read Bits & Bytes Now Alfa Romeo has an SUV, and we have so many questions 2017 Honda Civic Hatchback First Drive Jaguar I-PACE Concept previews Model X rivaling EV for 2018 MacBook Pro with Touch Bar Review (late-2016) Surface Book with Performance Base Review Latest Headlines The Mercedes-Maybach S 650 Cabriolet is kinda ridiculous Nov 16, 2016 Google Earth enters the world of VR with new Steam app Nov 16, 2016 America is finally ready for the 2018 Audi A5 and S5 Sportback Nov 16, 2016 Now Alfa Romeo has an SUV, and we have so many questions Nov 16, 2016 Nintendo gives escape rooms a Zelda twist in new US tour Nov 16, 2016 Latest Reviews Review: Logitech Z337 Bold Sound with Bluetooth 2.1 Speaker System Nov 16, 2016 MacBook Pro with Touch Bar Review (late-2016) Nov 14, 2016 Surface Book with Performance Base Review Nov 10, 2016 Google Daydream View Review Nov 10, 2016 LG V20 Review: Stealing the Note 7’s spotlight Nov 4, 2016 Search © 2005-2016 SlashGear, All Rights Reserved.

Search Search for: Becoming an RPG Goddess Adventures in Tabletop Gaming Menu Skip to content Home Campaigns Star Wars Saga Edition Posts Characters & NPCs Loot & Quest Items Handouts Ressources About Open Search The Break Out [Star Wars 1] New campaign, new character! So this is my first time playing a Star Wars campaign. The closest I’ve come to Star Wars was Dark Heresy. So needless to say I wasn’t entirely sure what to expect, but my Google-fu is quite strong so I wasn’t too worried about finding my way around the new system (we’re playing Saga Edition so it’s a d2o system). What struck me pretty much immediately is the Star Wars setting is the first system I’ve played where “roles” in the party aren’t exclusively focused around combat. We’re playing the Rebellion Era and reading up on what roles different classes could fill I realized I could build a character around non-combat oriented abilities and actually be really useful to the party. Which lends itself really well to story driven character design. And I like that a lot. I was pretty much sold on the idea of playing a noble right from the get-go, and the more I read (and googled) the more I liked what I could do with the class.  I ended up deciding to go for a “quartermaster” role, though as I googled by way around and rooted through the books the character evolved. And let me tell you I freaking love this character. Session Summary In the hopes of freeing her good friend Ashea, a smuggler and rebel, Ariday joins the force attacking the base. After her “unit” successfully breaks through the storm troopers defending the base, she and the wookie (behind whom she’d been standing the whole fight) find their way to the control room and locate the prisoner cells. While Ashea was no longer in her cell, having clearly broken out, there was a dead wookie still in the cell. Seeing her wookie companion becoming visibly upset (and not wanting to be anywhere near him if he went into a rage) Ariday quickly tries to calm him and offer what small comfort she can: they would go get the body and see his friend properly buried. While pulling up a floor plan of the base, Ariday was able to copy a great deal of data off the system, though she was not able to decrypt it. An alarm sounds to remind her there is little time left before the Imperial Star Ship arrives and begins an orbital bombardment of the base. She and the wookie head towards where Ariday anticipates Ashea will have to pass after escaping the cells and they manage to find each other, along with a teal coloured tregudan who seemed to know his way around weapons and a (human?) scout. Ashea and the wookie head back to the cells to retrieve the body of the fallen wookie (who had been instrumental in her and the other two’s escape) while Ariday and the other two escapees head outside to attempt to secure a transport, with only 5 minutes left before the orbital bombardment. Write-up/Highlight BOOM. Ariday cringed from behind her wookie “shield” as the explosion went off, throwing giant bits of the Imperial Base flying. She gripped he small hold-out blaster pistol carefully, knuckles white. The air was rife with the sounds of conflict as the rebel forces clashed with the imperial storm troopers in an attempt to overrun the Imperial Base. Keep it together. We have to get Ashea out of here. We can’t let the empire take anyone else from us.  Ariday screwed up her courage, lifted the pistol and leaned around her wookie friend, firing off a shot in the direction of one of the storm troopers. An immediate surge of remorse hit her and she felt relief when the shot went wide, missing the target completely. I can’t do it. How could she? Behind those white helmets were men. Men like Avrix. What had they been doing, an hour ago? Eating lunch in the break room? Talking about the latest news from home? Storm Trooper Speed Paint by inari123 A rebel to the right fell, and then another. She flinched as a shot passed alarmingly close, clearly aimed at her large and dangerous companion. Do something. If you don’t, you’ll die here. And so will Ashea. And you’ll never find Avrix. These men are going to kill you! With a curse her parents would have been shocked she knew, she took a deep breath and found the most dangerous looking trooper in the bunch. Taking time to aim this time, she deliberately fired a shot to glance harmlessly off his helmet. One of the rebels took advantage of the opening and gunned him down while he was distracted. She winced. Lesson learned Right before the session started I had to put the finishing touches on my character and since I didn’t know the system very well I asked the GM what languages I should pick. He suggested a bunch, including Shyriiwook. Now since I was trying to build this character around a background/story I opted not to take Shyriiwook because it didn’t make much sense for my character, who’d probably rarely encountered wookies, to understand their language. Another player agreed and also got the GMs permission to switch out that language for something more realistic. In hindsight, if the GM tells you to take a language, there’s probably a good reason. Like maybe you’re going to find yourself needing to stand behind one so you don’t get blaster to bits by storm troopers. Long story short: the GM made the suggestions because he knew he was going to be using wookies and silly me didn’t pick up on the hint. When the GM suggests you do a thing, do the thing.  Featured image “Storm Trooper Speed Paint” by  inari123     Rate this: Share this: Email Facebook Twitter Like this: Like Loading...

Ahead of that date, though, the leaks of the new phones are continuing to flow. New images of what’s said to be the Pixel, aka Sailfish, have leaked out. The renders have been shared by Android Authority and @OnLeaks, and they’re “factory renders,” which suggests that they’re based on factory CADs used to manufacture a device. The device in these renders looks similar to the Sailfish that we’ve seen in previously leaked photos and renders. There’s a glass panel at the top of the device that includes the rear camera and fingerprint reader and antenna lines on the metal body. We can also see what are likely the power/lock and volume buttons on the side of the phone, a headphone jack up top, and  USB Type-C port on the bottom. Rumors have suggested that the Pixel (codename Sailfish) and Pixel XL (codename Marlin) will have similar designs, just that the Marlin will be a bit bigger. It’s also been suggested that Google will offer an aluminum version with a white front and possibly an “Electric Blue” model with a blue back and white front. When it comes to specs, the Sailfish is rumored to be coming with a 5-inch 1920x1080 display, 12-megapixel rear and 8-megapixel cameras, quad-core Snapdragon processor, 4GB of RAM, and a 2,770mAh battery. The larger Marlin will reportedly have a similar feature set, but with a bigger 5.5-inch 2560x1440 screen and 3,450mAh battery. As I mentioned before, Google is reportedly going to unveil this Pixel and the larger Pixel XL (along with a 4K Chromecast and Daydream VR viewer) on October 4.

Homophobic diner criticises restaurant for ‘too many gay people’… owner shuts him down perfectly Staff at the Hell's Kitchen in Minneapolis responded by writing an open letter to the vile customer on Facebook By MARYSE FARAG 11th September 2016, 5:14 pm Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) Comments A HOMOPHOBIC customer who wrote a restaurant review complaining there were “too many gay people” has been shut down by the establishment. Hell’s Kitchen in Minneapolis, US, wasted no time in responding to the one-star Google review left by the vile diner named Eric. Facebook 2 Staff at Hell’s Kitchen in Minneapolis responded to an obnoxious review who criticised the restaurant by writing “too many gay people” Staff at the popular eatery decided to write an open letter on Facebook telling him to “never to come back”. The team said: “We’re writing in response to a review you posted on Google a few minutes ago. It simply said ‘too many gay people.’” “We ask that you not return to Hell’s Kitchen again. All of us who work here, whether straight or gay, view Hell’s Kitchen as our home; we open our doors each morning and do our best to make every person kind enough to dine with us feel as if it is their home, too.” Facebook 2 Facebook post in full from Hell’s Kitchen “We do our best to make every guest feel welcome, we do our best to create an environment that gives them a chance to enjoy the company of their friends, we do our best to create an environment that is blind to any form of prejudice and we do our best to create an environment that is safe.” “These aren’t ‘business goals’ they’re just naturally in the DNA of every one of the 166 members of our Hell’s Kitchen family. While you’re certainly free to post any comment you want about us, we’re equally free to say you cannot enter our home again.” Related Stories ‘You’ve just made his week’ Dad films adorable daughter giving her restaurant meal to a homeless man sitting outside FLAT-PACKED LUNCH Ikea launches a restaurant for foodies to host their own bashes and there’s not a meatball in sight Enjoying life Smiling Scarlett Moffatt shows off her slender legs after two stone weight loss at Jamie Oliver's restaurant MEXICAN STAND-OFF Cops called to Mexican restaurant in Tunbridge Wells after group rowed about their bill for TWO HOURS ONLINE DINING Amazon launches FREE one-hour restaurant delivery service for Prime members According to Hell’s Kitchen, the man decided to take down his review after the scathing response. The team posted an update saying: “Here at Hell’s Kitchen, some of us have said things we later wished we had not, and some of us had made mistakes that have hurt others… we’re very big believers in redemption here and always respect people who acknowledge that their words and actions have hurt others.” The post concluded: “We appreciate the steps this young man took today and would welcome an opportunity to have meet us so that he can learn a bit more about why we felt strongly about his words.” We pay for your stories!

Simon Erickson (TMFInnovator) Sep 11, 2016 at 11:25AM This article was originally published to Motley Fool Rule Breakers on Aug. 31, 2016. This Monday, Aug. 29, was an important day for unmanned aerial vehicles. After years of deliberation, the Federal Aviation Administration finalized and enacted its new regulations for the use of unmanned aircraft in commercial operations. In layman's terms, that means the ground rules -- er, air rules -- have been set for companies to begin using drones. Having this legal framework in place is crucial. Companies now know what's fair game for drones to do, which opens a floodgate of opportunities. Investors have certainly taken notice as well. Goldman Sachs estimates the potential market for drones is $100 billion, while PricewaterhouseCoopers thinks it's worth more like $127 billion.  Regardless of which of these huge numbers ends up being more accurate, it's safe to assume we'll see a lot more aerial machines buzzing around. In my latest Innovation and Industries feature, we'll look at three key areas where we expect drones will have the greatest impact: hardware, data, and e-commerce. We'll also reveal a few drone-related companies that are -- quite literally -- on our radar. Hardware: the drones themselves GoPro's Hero3 camera attached to DJI's Phantom II quadcopter. Source: DJI.com. The value chain for unmanned aircraft is still developing, but the first step is the hardware providers. We'll begin by looking at companies that build the internal components, which provide the essential features of the drones themselves. One of these important features will almost certainly be the capture of high-definition video. Ambarella (NASDAQ:AMBA) has been in this game for years -- it's made systems-on-a-chip to capture and play hi-def video in the earliest DVD codecs, in GoPro's (NASDAQ:GPRO) action sports cameras, and now in autonomous vehicles. Ambarella is making quite a scene in drones as well, with "flying cameras" representing one of its fastest-growing segments. The ability to maintain an upright position is another key feature, which InvenSense will likely play a role in fulfilling. The company's motion sensors monitor movement, acceleration, and rotation in three dimensions. Just as we've seen augmented reality catching on with smartphones (thanks, Pokemon Go), spacial positioning will help drones make sense of where they are.  Another play could be the companies selling fully assembled drones themselves. French company Parrot and China-based DJI are already well-known global leaders, but GoPro could also be a highly motivated player. Hungry to expand beyond action-sports cameras, the company plans to release its own Karma drone in time for this year's holiday season. Keep all of these in mind for your kids' Christmas lists. More generally, I believe we'll start to see consolidation. There is less value to a customer in having 1,000 fragmented drone suppliers than in having 100 -- which each provide standardized, software-integrated drones and a greater level of support. Semiconductor hardware is, historically, a difficult place to be in the value chain. It's fraught with competition, which makes it notoriously difficult for companies to differentiate themselves or avoid pricing pressure. But with the regulatory veil lifted and drones becoming mass-market affordable, we should certainly expect to see volumes take off in the coming years. Data and analytics: the value of information Google's SkyBender will use drones to deliver high-speed internet. Source: TechGiri. With thousands of drones soon hitting the skies, our next question might be "Why are they up there?"  To hobbyists, the answer is likely because they're fun. But businesses are deploying drones to drive profits. For instance, drones can replace human labor. Unmanned aircraft can cover distances more quickly, collect a greater amount of information, and "see" things that a human being cannot (such as infrared or multispectral images). The data collected will take on many forms, and we expect drones will become embedded within customers' existing workflows. Insurance companies might use drones to survey a home or take detailed pictures of an accident. Utility companies, which need to provide uninterrupted gas or power service, might want to monitor the condition of their assets. These customers aren't necessarily software developers, so there is a huge amount of value in other companies analyzing and interpreting the data collected by drones. Even better if they can also make it understandable and easy to base decisions on. Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is perhaps the best data-analyzer in the world. To complement its new and growing cloud-computing business, Google will likely find a way to make airspace the next platform for it to collect data from and innovate on. But it appears Big G also intends to use drones outside of data analytics. The company's somewhat secretive and awesomely named Project Skybender is testing solar-powered drones to deliver millimeter-wave radio transmissions, which could provide internet speeds 40 times faster than what is commercially available today. Alongside Project Loon, Google aims to bring high-speed internet to developing areas of the world without paying for expensive fiber cable or overburdening the already crowded cellular spectrum. Other companies are focusing on more niche applications. Trimble Navigation's agricultural guidance and steering systems could expand into using unmanned aircraft to apply pesticides or water crops. The growing field of precision agriculture looks to improve crop yields.  Whatever the application, the data collected by drones could provide new revenue streams and unlock quite a few business efficiencies.

Simon Erickson (TMFInnovator) Sep 11, 2016 at 11:25AM This article was originally published to Motley Fool Rule Breakers on Aug. 31, 2016. This Monday, Aug. 29, was an important day for unmanned aerial vehicles. After years of deliberation, the Federal Aviation Administration finalized and enacted its new regulations for the use of unmanned aircraft in commercial operations. In layman's terms, that means the ground rules -- er, air rules -- have been set for companies to begin using drones. Having this legal framework in place is crucial. Companies now know what's fair game for drones to do, which opens a floodgate of opportunities. Investors have certainly taken notice as well. Goldman Sachs estimates the potential market for drones is $100 billion, while PricewaterhouseCoopers thinks it's worth more like $127 billion.  Regardless of which of these huge numbers ends up being more accurate, it's safe to assume we'll see a lot more aerial machines buzzing around. In my latest Innovation and Industries feature, we'll look at three key areas where we expect drones will have the greatest impact: hardware, data, and e-commerce. We'll also reveal a few drone-related companies that are -- quite literally -- on our radar. Hardware: the drones themselves GoPro's Hero3 camera attached to DJI's Phantom II quadcopter. Source: DJI.com. The value chain for unmanned aircraft is still developing, but the first step is the hardware providers. We'll begin by looking at companies that build the internal components, which provide the essential features of the drones themselves. One of these important features will almost certainly be the capture of high-definition video. Ambarella (NASDAQ:AMBA) has been in this game for years -- it's made systems-on-a-chip to capture and play hi-def video in the earliest DVD codecs, in GoPro's (NASDAQ:GPRO) action sports cameras, and now in autonomous vehicles. Ambarella is making quite a scene in drones as well, with "flying cameras" representing one of its fastest-growing segments. The ability to maintain an upright position is another key feature, which InvenSense will likely play a role in fulfilling. The company's motion sensors monitor movement, acceleration, and rotation in three dimensions. Just as we've seen augmented reality catching on with smartphones (thanks, Pokemon Go), spacial positioning will help drones make sense of where they are.  Another play could be the companies selling fully assembled drones themselves. French company Parrot and China-based DJI are already well-known global leaders, but GoPro could also be a highly motivated player. Hungry to expand beyond action-sports cameras, the company plans to release its own Karma drone in time for this year's holiday season. Keep all of these in mind for your kids' Christmas lists. More generally, I believe we'll start to see consolidation. There is less value to a customer in having 1,000 fragmented drone suppliers than in having 100 -- which each provide standardized, software-integrated drones and a greater level of support.

The true-story of Saroo Brierly, who was adopted from India as a boy and later used Google Earth to locate his family, gives the indie distributor perhaps his best chance of awards glory this year. It’s uplifting, humanistic, and unabashedly sentimental, all things that Oscar voters love. In fact, Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences President Cheryl Boone Isaacs was on hand both at the Toronto International Film Festival premiere Saturday night and at its after party at Soho House. There, Weinstein and his right hand man, David Glasser, huddled over a smartphone (perhaps scouring through Twitter reactions?), while revelers sipped champagne and mixed drinks in the club’s baronial setting. Related Director Garth Davis on His Awards Season Contender ‘Lion’ and Working With Dev Patel Earlier in the evening, the crowd at the Princess of Wales Theatre had roared as the credits rolled, leaping to their feet for a standing ovation. There were also audible sniffles during the picture’s climax. Critics were more mixed in their appraisals, suggesting that the picture’s appeal may be more populist. Variety’s Peter Debruge, for instance, argued that the film was too flimsy, writing, “While unique, Saroo’s story is somewhere between the-guy-who-found-a-lottery-scratcher-worth-fifty-bucks and the-farmer-who-prayed-for-rain-and-got-it.” Others were more generous. IndieWire’s Eric Kohn praised the film’s neo-realist initial sequences where a five-year old Saroo is separated from his family on the streets of Calcutta. “These scenes could anchor an entire movie on their own even without the 20-year time jump that follows them,” he wrote. At the party after, the sense was that Nicole Kidman, de-glammed in an ’80s perm as Saroo’s adopted mother, may have the best chance at landing a nomination in the supporting actress category. Dev Patel also impressed playing the adult Saroo as a man haunted by his past. The sense, however, was Patel would be more viable in a supporting, rather than lead, campaign. In the past, the Weinstein Company has mixed Oscar advocacy with social justice pushes to great effect with the likes of “Philomena” and “The Imitation Game,” both of which earned Best Picture nods while drawing attention to adoption rights and gay rights.  “Lion” clearly intends to have a similar impact. The picture concludes with a message about the 80,000 children in India who are lost each year, urging audiences to learn more about what they can do to help. “I hope it creates a platform for change,” said director Garth Davis during a question and answer session after the film screened. He said he hoped more people would consider adoption. “If you’re in a loving family that’s all that matters,” he said. Weinstein has a lot riding on the film. The indie impresario has been dogged by murmurs that the Weinstein Company is in financial trouble; rumblings that have grown as the studio has lost a number of key executives. At the same time, he’s signaled that he is more interested in television than the movie business, believing it to be a more stable source of revenues . That strategic shift has robbed recent festival markets of one of its most active buyers. If Silicon Valley got a vote, “Lion” would be a lock for Best Picture. The film plays like an ode to technology’s power to connect disparate worlds and make us whole. No surprise. Going into Toronto, Davis admitted that Google loved the film. “It’s a wonderful advert for them,” he said.

Stock and Never Sell No. 1 is the most important, and No. 5 should convince you that no one can touch the company. Brian Stoffel (TMFCheesehead) Sep 11, 2016 at 8:08AM Image source: Jurgen Appelo, via Flickr. We talk a good game about buy-and-hold investing here at The Motley Fool. But the truth is, not all Fools always live up to that mantra in the real world. For instance, I bought shares of Alphabet (back when it was Google) at just $150 per share. If I'd held those shares, I'd have a four-bagger (over 400% return) on my hands. But instead, I sold at $200. What a waste! Thankfully, I've learned from those mistakes. Today, I want to talk about Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN). The company occupies a (perhaps imprudent) 20% share of my family's real-life holdings. But we have no intention of selling...ever. Here's why. 1. The single most important thing Have you ever read Amazon's mission statement? It has nothing to do with e-commerce, or books, or even cloud hosting. And yet, it's been exactly the same since Day One. And it is the lens through which both the company's past and future need to be viewed: We seek to be Earth's most customer-centric company.  Some might view branching into groceries, or original video content -- or even delivery services that could soon rival FedEx and UPS -- as leaving the e-commerce circle of competence. But to CEO Jeff Bezos, these moves are just a continuation of the company's mission: to disrupt industries that aren't serving customers as well as they could be, and rewrite the rules. That gives the company an unending list of potential futures that will be exciting to see unfold. 2. A founder-led company We here at The Motley Fool love founder-led companies -- partly because Tom Gardner is still at the reins here, but mostly because founders tend to be more passionate about the success of the companies they created. A study out of Purdue's Krannert School of Management showed that founder-led companies tend to be more innovative (as measured by the number of patents obtained) and financially successful. Jeff Bezos founded Amazon back in 1994, and he's been at the helm ever since. 3. Bezos has lots of skin in the game Lest you think that Bezos is using Amazon as a simple cash machine to enrich himself, it's worth noting that he has a significant personal stake. As of the company's April proxy statement, Bezos owned roughly 83 million shares of Amazon. That's equivalent to almost 18% of the company, and worth about $64 billion. When you invest with Amazon, your interests are aligned with Bezos'. 4. The e-commerce trend is just getting started It's hard to capture just how far e-commerce still has to go: Image source: U.S. Census Bureau  According to the U.S. Census Bureau, we have only seen the tip of the iceberg. As of July, only 8% of all retail sales occurred via e-commerce. While I don't think we'll ever see the figure approach 100%, even if half of all purchases are eventually made online, that means a quintupling of today's levels. Amazon, more than anyone, stands to benefit from this. 5. Those fulfillment centers deliver a huge moat One of the biggest advantages Amazon has over the competition is its network of fulfillment centers. According to logistics consultant MWPVL, the company has 82 such centers in America, with plans for 31 more. These centers are multimillion-dollar buildings; competitors would have to go into deep debt to just scratch the surface of matching Amazon's scale. Research by Piper Jaffray finds that an incredible 44% of the U.S. population now lives within a mere 20 miles of an Amazon fulfillment network "node." It's because of this network that Amazon can deliver your packages so quickly -- the main benefit of membership in Amazon Prime. 6. The strength of Prime The benefits of a $99 Amazon Prime membership are astounding. But really, it all comes down to free two-day shipping. How popular is that deal? The company is pretty tight-lipped about such numbers, but that hasn't stopped others from doing their own research. BI Intelligence estimates that in December 2011, there were fewer than 10 million Prime members. By the end of last year, it's believed that this figure increased 700% to 80 million members.  7. There's still a huge international market to tackle If you back out Amazon Web Services, North America accounted for 64% of all e-commerce sales for the company in 2015. All international markets combined contributed just 36% to the top line. 8. The company's willing to fail When analysts took cheap shots at Bezos after the failure of the Amazon Fire phone, he had this to say: If you think that's a big failure, we're working on much bigger failures right now -- and I am not kidding. Some of them are going to make the Fire Phone look like a tiny little blip.  Why is that such a good thing? Because innovation comes from embracing trial and error -- and "error" is a necessary component. None of the bold bets Amazon is making will bankrupt the company, but if just a few turn out to work, the effect on the company's bottom line will be enormous. 9. Previous winners tend to keep winning We're often afraid to buy a stock when it's gone up so much. But there's usually a reason that a stock experiences tremendous jumps: because its shares represent ownership in one of the greatest companies of our time. Amazon has returned 2,400% for shareholders over the last ten years. That's a great track record that I expect to see continue -- albeit at a tempered pace. 10. I love using the company I get a box from the company delivered every other day. I love it. I know why it's a stock worth owning. You probably do, too. So why don't you own shares yet?

Called WaveNet, the new AI is said to act as a deep neural network that’s capable of generating speech by sampling real human speech and forming raw audio waveforms. Testing among English and Mandarin Chinese listeners has found that WaveNet is already better than existing text-to-speech systems, but still just short of being as convincing as a real human’s speech. Current text-to-speech programs work in one of two ways; the first is a human-sounding voice that speaks via recordings of actual speech that have been broken up into tiny pieces and rearranged — a bit like a ransom letter. The other relies on a computer-generated voice that has been programmed with rules on grammar and sounds, meaning it doesn’t need pre-recorded recorded material, but in turn comes out very robotic sounding. WaveNet, on the other hand, still uses real voice input, but it learns and mimics this speech rather than cutting up recordings. “A single WaveNet can capture the characteristics of many different speakers with equal fidelity, and can switch between them by conditioning on the speaker identity,” the project’s researchers wrote. Just as impressive is the fact that it can apply things like mouth movements and artificial breaths in order to simulate inflections, emotions, and accents. And if that’s not enough, the AI works just as well with piano music too, with the researchers feeding it a number of classical pieces, enabling it to create its own compositions. WaveNet is still a long ways off from powering Google’s apps and voice assistant, but you listen to a number of samples posted with DeepMind’s announcement.

Stock and Never Sell No. 1 is the most important, and No. 5 should convince you that no one can touch the company. Brian Stoffel (TMFCheesehead) Sep 11, 2016 at 8:08AM Image source: Jurgen Appelo, via Flickr. We talk a good game about buy-and-hold investing here at The Motley Fool. But the truth is, not all Fools always live up to that mantra in the real world. For instance, I bought shares of Alphabet (back when it was Google) at just $150 per share. If I'd held those shares, I'd have a four-bagger (over 400% return) on my hands. But instead, I sold at $200. What a waste! Thankfully, I've learned from those mistakes. Today, I want to talk about Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN). The company occupies a (perhaps imprudent) 20% share of my family's real-life holdings. But we have no intention of selling...ever. Here's why. 1. The single most important thing Have you ever read Amazon's mission statement? It has nothing to do with e-commerce, or books, or even cloud hosting. And yet, it's been exactly the same since Day One. And it is the lens through which both the company's past and future need to be viewed: We seek to be Earth's most customer-centric company.  Some might view branching into groceries, or original video content -- or even delivery services that could soon rival FedEx and UPS -- as leaving the e-commerce circle of competence. But to CEO Jeff Bezos, these moves are just a continuation of the company's mission: to disrupt industries that aren't serving customers as well as they could be, and rewrite the rules. That gives the company an unending list of potential futures that will be exciting to see unfold. 2. A founder-led company We here at The Motley Fool love founder-led companies -- partly because Tom Gardner is still at the reins here, but mostly because founders tend to be more passionate about the success of the companies they created. A study out of Purdue's Krannert School of Management showed that founder-led companies tend to be more innovative (as measured by the number of patents obtained) and financially successful. Jeff Bezos founded Amazon back in 1994, and he's been at the helm ever since. 3. Bezos has lots of skin in the game Lest you think that Bezos is using Amazon as a simple cash machine to enrich himself, it's worth noting that he has a significant personal stake. As of the company's April proxy statement, Bezos owned roughly 83 million shares of Amazon. That's equivalent to almost 18% of the company, and worth about $64 billion. When you invest with Amazon, your interests are aligned with Bezos'. 4. The e-commerce trend is just getting started It's hard to capture just how far e-commerce still has to go: Image source: U.S. Census Bureau  According to the U.S. Census Bureau, we have only seen the tip of the iceberg. As of July, only 8% of all retail sales occurred via e-commerce. While I don't think we'll ever see the figure approach 100%, even if half of all purchases are eventually made online, that means a quintupling of today's levels. Amazon, more than anyone, stands to benefit from this. 5. Those fulfillment centers deliver a huge moat One of the biggest advantages Amazon has over the competition is its network of fulfillment centers. According to logistics consultant MWPVL, the company has 82 such centers in America, with plans for 31 more. These centers are multimillion-dollar buildings; competitors would have to go into deep debt to just scratch the surface of matching Amazon's scale. Research by Piper Jaffray finds that an incredible 44% of the U.S. population now lives within a mere 20 miles of an Amazon fulfillment network "node." It's because of this network that Amazon can deliver your packages so quickly -- the main benefit of membership in Amazon Prime. 6. The strength of Prime The benefits of a $99 Amazon Prime membership are astounding. But really, it all comes down to free two-day shipping. How popular is that deal? The company is pretty tight-lipped about such numbers, but that hasn't stopped others from doing their own research. BI Intelligence estimates that in December 2011, there were fewer than 10 million Prime members. By the end of last year, it's believed that this figure increased 700% to 80 million members.  7. There's still a huge international market to tackle If you back out Amazon Web Services, North America accounted for 64% of all e-commerce sales for the company in 2015. All international markets combined contributed just 36% to the top line. 8. The company's willing to fail When analysts took cheap shots at Bezos after the failure of the Amazon Fire phone, he had this to say: If you think that's a big failure, we're working on much bigger failures right now -- and I am not kidding. Some of them are going to make the Fire Phone look like a tiny little blip.  Why is that such a good thing? Because innovation comes from embracing trial and error -- and "error" is a necessary component. None of the bold bets Amazon is making will bankrupt the company, but if just a few turn out to work, the effect on the company's bottom line will be enormous. 9. Previous winners tend to keep winning We're often afraid to buy a stock when it's gone up so much. But there's usually a reason that a stock experiences tremendous jumps: because its shares represent ownership in one of the greatest companies of our time. Amazon has returned 2,400% for shareholders over the last ten years. That's a great track record that I expect to see continue -- albeit at a tempered pace. 10. I love using the company I get a box from the company delivered every other day. I love it. I know why it's a stock worth owning. You probably do, too. So why don't you own shares yet?

The new AI technology developed by DeepMind researchers is called WaveNet. It marks the achievement of a new milestone in the company's AI project. According to DeepMind researchers, the breakthrough WaveNet technology can be described as a deep neural network which is capable of generating raw audio wave forms to produce speech. The technology can apparently outperform the currently-in-use Text-to-Speech systems by reducing the gap in human performance -- which could be demonstrated in an actual AI, that is, human conversation -- by up to 50 percent. Moreover, WaveNet - which can presently use only the English and Chinese languages - also boasts the ability to learn different voices and speech patterns to such an extent that it can not only simulate mouth movements and artificial breaths, but also accents, emotions, and language inflections. In their paper announcing the new WaveNet AI technology, the researchers said: "A single WaveNet can capture the characteristics of many different speakers with equal fidelity, and can switch between them by conditioning on the speaker identity."   Submitted by admin on Sun, 09/11/2016 - 07:04 Log in or register to post comments Powered by Drupal Footer menu Contact

Shoppers can use a mobile app to place their orders. Kroger ClickList selector Debra Cross, from left, and e-commerce manager Corey Thurmond deliver an online grocery order to Evans resident Jennifer Speer and her son Brayden at the new Grovetown Kroger store Thursday morning. Kroger e-commerce manager Corey Thurmond hands 8-year-old Brayden Speer a ballon while he and ClickList selector Debra Cross deliver his mother Jennifer's groceries Thursday morning at the new Grovetown Kroger store. Kroger e-commerce division field specialist Shelia Brick, left, and Grovetown e-commerce manager, Corey Thurmond, check on refrigerated items awaiting delivery to ClickList online grocery customers Thursday. Robbie Hendry, Wal-Mart's regional e-commerce market coach, shows the area of the parking lot designated for online order pickup at the Evans Wal-Mart Supercenter.   Pushing around a grocery cart with her 8-year-old son in tow was not something Jennifer Speer wanted to do Thursday morning. Thanks to Kroger’s new online grocery ordering service, ClickList, she didn’t have to. Employees at the new Kroger Mar­ket­place in Grovetown had Speer’s shopping list checked off and loaded into her SUV without her or son Brayden ever leaving their seats. “This really made my day because I’ve been sick all week,” said Speer, who heard about ClickList from mothers in her home-schooling network. “I’m just now starting to recover, so it was nice to just pull up and have everything ready.” The Cincinnati-based chain isn’t the only supermarket offering online ordering in the Augusta market. This past week, Wal-Mart brought its online grocery service to two of its area stores: the Evans Supercenter on Washington Road and the Hephzibah Neigh­bor­hood Market on Windsor Spring Road. Robbie Hendry, Wal-Mart’s regional e-commerce market coach, said local customer feedback has so far been in the 90 percent positive range. “Obviously, we want to be 100 percent every single time,” Hendry said. Though e-commerce is in its second decade, using computers or smartphones to buy groceries is a fairly recent phenomenon outside America’s largest cities, where internet giants such as Amazon and Google have been busy expanding their AmazonFresh and Google Express grocery delivery services. Kroger and Wal-Mart’s curbside pickup services are more closely aligned with what analysts call the “click-and-collect” model – also called “BOPUS” for buy-online-pick-up-in-store. Non-grocery brick-and-mortar retailers, such as Best Buy and The Home Depot, have been doing it for years as more shoppers embrace e-commerce. More than one third of shoppers made click-and-collect purchases during the 2015 holiday season, according to an International Coun­cil of Shopping Centers’ consumer purchasing trends survey. Market research firm IBISWorld projects online grocery shopping sales will increase 9.5 percent to $9.4 billion in 2017. Kroger and Wal-Mart’s online grocery programs were launched in select markets starting in 2014, and the two operate in a similar manner. Shoppers fill their virtual carts by choosing from tens of thousands of items – including fresh meats, dairy and produce – found on the stores’ websites and smartphone apps. Shoppers then select a store location and pickup time, along with any special requests. “They can tell us whether they want ripe avocados or green bananas,” said Sheila Brick, Kroger’s e-commerce field specialist for the Atlanta division. “They can tell us how thick they want their steaks cut.” Specially trained employees handpick the items and store them in a special staging area with refrigerators and freezers until the customer arrives, pulling into one of the specially marked pick-up lanes and signaling their arrival via cellphone. Items are then brought to the customer’s car and the order is completed when the customer signs off on the charges on a handheld device. All items ordered online are priced the same as they are in the store. Kroger, however, charges a $4.95 convenience fee that is waived for the first three orders. Wal-Mart has no fee but requires a $30 minimum on online orders. Hendry points out that Geor­gia state law prohibits “curbside” alcohol delivery, and that Wal-Mart doesn’t allow apparel purchases through the online grocery. “Everything else – dog food, health and beauty supplies, electronics – all the good stuff in here can be delivered right to your car,” he said. The target online grocery shoppers are convenience-seeking moms with toddlers and young children. But the store employees say the service also appeals to dads who aren’t adept at grocery shopping, along with the elderly, the infirm and people who simply don’t like going shopping. Parents are finding out it is also a good way to purchase grocery items for their college-age children, Hendry said. “This is better than just handing them a twenty,” he said. “This way you know they’ll actually get groceries instead of just beer.” Wal-Mart and Kroger, the No. 1 and 2 grocers in the Augusta market according to Chain Store Guide, are so far the only traditional grocery chains to offer local online ordering. Warehouse membership stores, such as Sam’s Club and Costco, have online ordering options but no pure “click-and-collect” service. Whole Foods Market has a partnership with grocery delivery company Instacart, but there is no timeline for when the service will be available in Augusta, Whole Foods’ Atlanta spokeswoman Lauren Bernath said. Food Lion spokeswoman Christy Phillips-Brown said the company is “currently exploring a number of options for both in-store grocery pick-up and home delivery” but has no timetable for service in Augusta. The Salisbury, N.C.-based retailer offers Instacart service in select ZIP codes in Charlotte, N.C., and Raleigh, N.C. Discount grocer Aldi has an online presence and mobile apps, but no plans to take online orders at any of its locations. Southeastern Grocers, owner of the Bi-Lo chain, said in a statement that it is always looking for ways to improve customer service. “We’re always listening to our customers and looking into new ways to offer both convenience and value for an enjoyable shopping experience,” said Joe Caldwell, the corporate communications manager for the Jacksonville, Fla.-based chain. “As new technology and services constantly develop, we carefully evaluate each opportunity for our network of stores. We will certainly update our customers if we unveil any new services.” Lakeland, Fla.-based Publix Super Markets Inc. did not respond to a request for comment. AT A GLANCE Wal-Mart and Kroger both rolled out online grocery services this past week in the Augusta area.

Crunch Network Facebook isn’t just fighting ad blockers, it’s fighting the underlying causes of blocking Posted Sep 10, 2016 by Roy Rosenfeld 0 SHARES Next Story When’s the best time to share on Facebook? Roy Rosenfeld Crunch Network Contributor Roy Rosenfeld is the CEO of Fair Ad Blocker. How to join the network Independent publishers are terrified of platform dependency these days, and for good reason: According to Parse.ly, Facebook is the No. 1 source of traffic to their sites. Facebook and Google together account for 65 percent of digital ad revenue, according to Pew’s State of the News Media 2016 report. To put that in perspective, that’s up from around 0 percent just 10 years ago. Facebook is absolutely crushing them in mobile, too, where the real user growth is — and there, it’s not even close. That’s the reality, and it’s led a lot of publishers to conclude they’d be better off not competing with Facebook for eyeballs, choosing instead to forsake the exclusivity of their own properties and publish directly to the social network. Many side observers now believe we will soon witness the end of the dot-com — i.e. the wholesale migration of content away from independent publisher properties and onto Facebook. The thing is, Facebook has demonstrated recently that it’s willing to change its algorithm whenever it wants, and that publishers can’t rely on it as a stable channel. A savior for publishers Facebook is not. Indeed, publishers’ anxiety is both very real and very justified. How did this happen? The obvious interpretation is that Facebook has the scale, the traffic and, thus, the leverage. But that’s not all there is to it. Facebook has actually been a pioneer in finding the right way to monetize their audience without pissing it off. And this is where its recent moves against ad blocking become very, very interesting. First, it’s worth reviewing what Facebook is doing right in its audience monetization strategy: Fewer ads: Facebook decided to show people fewer ads and thus are able to charge more for them. They actually come out with more revenue than if they showed more ads for less money. Fewer ads also helps the user experience, thus reducing the motivation for users to block. Non-interruptive ads: Facebook has pioneered the non-interruptive advertising experience. Facebook literally changed the way we think about an ad, from an interruptive display unit on the right side, to an actual piece of sponsored content in-feed that looks and feels just like the non-advertising content around it. Safe, lean ads: Facebook doesn’t let ads weigh on load times. This is a big one — and a major reason for Instant Articles. Slow page-load times on publisher properties are largely connected to the serving and tracking of ads, and the way users respond is to install ad blockers. That’s particularly sensitive on mobile, where data plans are at stake. Controllable ad experience: And now, Facebook is leading the charge in providing users with precise controls over which ads they see, and from whom. That was the part that many people missed recently, when Facebook “blocked the blockers.” In so doing, they also introduced precise controls for users that allow them to dictate the kinds of ads they see. Facebook is signaling to the broader advertising and publishing world that the future lies in fewer ads, more respect for consumer privacy and more deference to a user’s preferences. Many publishers are actually making solid efforts at delivering this type of experience themselves, but such efforts are going to waste because of the “binary” and unsophisticated nature of most ad blockers. By blocking all ads on all sites, these blockers treat all publishers as the lowest common denominator, throwing premium publishers (and Facebook) in with the worst-offending sites on the web — the ones that present the risk of malware, that invade privacy, that drag on load times, that ruin the user’s experience. Related Articles Facebook's blocker-blocking ads blocked by blockers AdBlock Plus closes in on a billion downloads Survey says 25 percent of smartphone owners have downloaded ad blockers So while many have interpreted Facebook’s move to “block the blockers” as a sign that Facebook is prioritizing its relationship to advertisers over users, it’s actually far more subtle. Facebook is trying to find — and own — the middle ground that neither advertisers nor publishers have been able to inhabit successfully. Odds are that Facebook does find that middle ground. The question is whether the rest of the digital ecosystem can find it and maintain it independently. At the moment, the binary nature of ad blockers has forced each side (publishers and users) into entrenched positions that render the good faith attempts obsolete and leave the underlying causes of blocking unaddressed. If publishers respond by blocking blockers, or by increasing their ad load, users will only block more. And if users continue using indiscriminate blockers, publishers will have few good choices left. Far from simply waging war on the blockers, Facebook is trying to carve out the only middle ground that will be left when the war is over.

But is innovation just a euphemism for privatisation? Taxi drivers in Santiago, Chile carry a fake coffin to protest against Uber. Now the public sector is being courted by the tech firm’s promise of more efficient services. Photograph: Reuters Saturday 10 September 2016 19.05 EDT Last modified on Sunday 11 September 2016 10.29 EDT Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close The irony must be lost on Silicon Valley: Uber, a company run by an unabashed admirer of libertarian novelist and philosopher Ayn Rand, is increasingly touted as the saviour of American public transport systems, establishing partnerships with many municipalities to offer a parallel, privately run alternative. The likes of Mark Zuckerberg already rule the media. Now they want to censor the past | Marina Hyde Read more Some local governments already offer impressive discounts to their citizens who use Uber; why, after all, spend all this taxpayer money on infrastructure upgrades if one can simply hand it over to Silicon Valley firms? Others consider outsourcing particular functions – like the transportation of the disabled mandated by law – with Uber being the most obvious candidate to benefit. Uber’s foray into public services is part of a broader trend of technology firms pitching their services to cash-strapped municipalities and governments. They do so in the hope of convincing local authorities that the company’s superior ability to gather, analyse and act on data would yield tremendous savings for the public sector, while stimulating innovation and entrepreneurship. It all began with an explosion of “smart” programs – with “smart” nothing but a euphemism for “privatised”. From smart cities to smart elderly care, the promise has been to retrofit crumbling public infrastructure with the shiny and privately operated gadgetry that can get the job done on the cheap. “Smart” might no longer be a sexy adjective but its spirit lives on. Online home rental company Airbnb is building community centres in Japan, probably betting on the fact that the rapidly ageing Japanese population would inevitably push the government to search for an “Uber of smart ageing”. With all the data they have accumulated about our travel and living habits, Airbnb could, in fact, be in a perfect position to build social housing that might actually be fit to live in. Alphabet, the parent company of Google, is also making overtures to local administrations. Flow, its new software developed by Sidewalk Labs, aims to deploy troves of Alphabet data in order to mitigate the effects of intractable problems such as parking. And what city wouldn’t pay Alphabet a small fee, for the benefit of running super-efficient real-time auctions for each parking spot, thus helping to fill public coffers? Facebook Twitter Pinterest Alphabet hopes to use its Waze traffic and navigation app to profit from carpooling. Photograph: Paul Sakuma/AP Perhaps Alphabet will solve the parking problem by simply discouraging people from driving altogether: Alphabet is also launching its own car-sharing service – a competitor to Uber and rival taxi app Lyft – built around Waze, its service for analysing traffic data. The idea is for Alphabet to match up passengers with drivers who are headed in the same direction, thanks to all the data that it has accumulated about us and our movements. Then there’s Google Fiber, Alphabet’s other project, that hopes to provide fast and accessible internet connectivity to communities neglected by traditional telecom operators. As if this weren’t generous enough, Alphabet has also committed to wire up various public housing projects in the US, essentially subsidising internet access for low-income citizens – a tactic the company, along with Facebook, also pursues in the developing world. This entanglement between Silicon Valley and the public sector explains why tech executives prefer Democrats to Republicans. Having realised that there’s a lot of money to be made, technology firms have no desire to shrink the public sector: why deprive themselves of lucrative government contracts? A bloated government, which turns the administration of its programmes over to the private sector, would do just fine. The blame, of course, does not reside solely with Silicon Valley. The public sector itself can no longer think outside the neoliberal toolkit of corporations, markets and networks. But it also cannot and would not abandon itself. So it simply recruits the private sector to run its affairs. For governments, such deals promise speed and savings. For Silicon Valley, they promise guaranteed revenue – as well as guaranteed access to customers’ data, which, in the long run, might be more important than the revenue. This model makes the provision of essential services – once the preserve of the welfare state and local governments – dependent on the whims of corporations and their business models. And such whims are aplenty: markets that once looked so lucrative often prove to be loss-making in the light of new developments that were not part of the initial modelling. At this point, most firms prefer to cut their losses and quietly exit the scene, leaving citizens deprived of an important service. Such seems to be the fate of Obamacare – a quintessential product of remodelling welfare provision on the market model. Insurance providers, which were expected to compete with each other to offer customers the best deal, have realised that it’s mostly old people knocking on their doors, while the young – who are generally healthier and do not need much healthcare – tend to shy away. This means that many insurance providers find their participation in Obamacare too costly. As a result, they quit the insurance exchanges, leaving some communities with just one or no insurance providers to choose from. Silicon Valley does not have its own high-profile equivalent of Obamacare yet. There is, however, no reason to believe that tech firms will prove more effective at predicting their own failures than the insurance industry. Alphabet might have hoped to save the world but Google Fiber is in dire straits: the company now wants to halve the number of its employees, freezing plans for further extension in several areas. Apparently, building infrastructure is more difficult than selling online ads. A similar fate has overtaken Alphabet’s other “moonshot” ventures: Project Ara – an effort to make a modular smartphone out of interchangeable components – has just been suspended, joining the likes of Google Glass. Nest, the subsidiary that produces “smart’ thermostats, is also doing badly, with its former CEO Tony Fadell moving on to other projects and its staff reassigned to work on the “smart home” instead. Nest, too, was once pitched as a welfare-enhancing device: some insurance companies, having struck deals with Alphabet, offered Nest smoke detectors to their customers free of charge, in exchange for their data. Uber’s tempting offers are also far less straightforward than they appear. Its fares are, indeed, extremely low – which makes it very attractive to consumers and local governments alike. But such low rates mask layers of subsidies and tenuous assumptions that might or might not pan out. Uber’s low rates are premised on two developments: its ability to dispense with its drivers altogether – thus significantly reducing its labour costs – and the continuation of its impressive and virtually unopposed growth in every important market. A tiny change in those underlying assumptions and the promised savings might evaporate overnight. Uber’s users in China learned this the hard way when, just days after the company made a deal with its Chinese competitor Didi Chuxing, its rates reportedly doubled, at least for some Chinese users. Factor in the likely regulatory backlash, thousands of angry drivers who stand to lose their jobs, along with the aggressive anti-Uber lobbying pursued by its competitors: there’s little that is not unstable or fragile in Uber’s welfare model. What happens once the tech firms do become the only game in town? Will they be like those drug companies that, having entered into profitable and seemingly eternal deals with the government, can charge the public sector exorbitant prices, simply because there’s not much competition around? In the end, welfare by corporations is nothing but welfare for corporations.

You Should Be Shot, Says Facebook Post Of Denise Crowley-Whitfield News 20 0 0 September 10, 2016 Pastor Allen Joyner: Don’t Stand For National Anthem? You Should Be Shot, Says Facebook Post Of Denise Crowley-Whitfield Paula Mooney So much for Christian compassion. The Facebook page of Denise Crowley-Whitfield posted an account of something said by Pastor Allen Joyner that is going viral, even as the Facebook post of Crowley-Whitfield has been deleted. As reported by the Inquisitr, the incident surrounds the national anthem protest that has brought cries of an NFL boycott from select NFL fans. However, the Google cache of the Crowley-Whitfield Facebook post still lives on, with Denise’s account of Pastor Joyner’s words about those who refuse to stand for the national anthem potentially becoming shooting victims spreading across the web like wildfire. “Tonight, in McKenzie, Alabama, the announcer audibly spoke the words that millions of Americans are thinking. He said, ‘If you don’t want to stand for the National Anthem, you can line up over there by the fence and let our military personnel take a few shots AT you since they’re taking shots FOR you.’ The entire crowd went crazy cheering. I desperately needed to see some good in this world after a disheartening week. May our God bless ALL His children (even the ungrateful ones) and this incredible country in which we live!” According the AL.com, the melee took place on Friday evening in Alabama’s Butler County. Denise’s Facebook post did not make mention of Colin Kaepernick, nor his reasons for protesting the national anthem, as reported by the Inquisitr. Update: According to the Greenville Advocate, Pastor Joyner claims that Crowley-Whitfield misquoted him on Facebook, claiming that the pastor never said anyone should be shot. “I never said anybody should be shot. My words were ‘if you don’t want to stand for the national anthem, please go sit at the baseball field and let some of our folks take a shot at reminding you of the price our military paid for your freedom to sit.'” There was a football game taking place at McKenzie High School, when Pastor Allen Joyner, who leads Sweet Home Baptist Church in McKenzie — a church whose Facebook page has also been deleted, but the cache is also still alive via Google — made the statement about national anthem protesters being shot. Pastor Joyner’s words resonated at the game of McKenzie High School vs. Houston County High School. The Facebook post of Crowley-Whitfield noted that the McKenzie High School crowd went crazy. As seen on the screenshot Crowley-Whitfield’s Facebook post, the Facebook post grew pretty popular before being deleted. [Photo by AP Images] The latest melee about protests during the national anthem do not represent the first time that athletes have used their platforms to bring attention to things more important than sports. As seen in the above photo from October 16, 1968, Tommie Smith and John Carlos raised their fists as the “Star Spangled Banner” played during the Summer Olympic Games in Mexico City. The iconic images of that protest have endured for decades, after the duo received gold and bronze medals, respectively, for the 200-meter run. [Photo by M. Spencer Green/AP Images] In the above photo from March 15, 1996, Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf — a former Denver Nuggets guard — prayed during the national anthem. Meanwhile, feedback about Pastor Joyner’s words are being published en masse on social media. However, Amy Bryan, the Butler County Schools Superintendent, did not agree with Pastor Joyner threatening violence against national anthem protesters. “Patriotism should be a part of school events but threats of shooting people who aren’t patriotic, even in jest, have no place at a school. Threats of violence are a violation of school policy and certainly not condoned by the school board.” Pastor Joyner and Crowley-Whitfield are receiving feedback such as the following on social media, which can be read in a sampling of comments taken from Facebook about Pastor Joyner’s words and Denise’s Facebook post. “First of all, free speech protects your right to speak and freedom of protest protects you to protest. Sir, you are a PASTOR. A PASTOR. You HYPOCRITE! Wow! Shall not murder must mean nothing to you then you need to STEP DOWN! Second of all, we are not North Korea! WE DO NOT NEED TO BE SHOOTING PEOPLE FOR PRACTICING THEIR RIGHTS!” “See this is the crap that keeps reproducing.” [Photo by Denis Poroy/AP Images] Now Watch This: Biden and Obama Memes Take Over The Internet Now Read This: Jared Kushner: Donald Trump’s Son-In-Law Is ‘Draining The Swamp,’ And He Is Starting With Those Close To The President-Elect [Opinion] Share 20 Tweet 0 Share 0 Share 0 Pin It 0 Author Paula Mooney Tags: Denise Crowley-Whitfield, Pastor Allen Joyner Comments LATEST HEADLINES Drake Is Getting Revenge On Rihanna — And Taylor Swift Is Helping [Report] Best Buy Black Friday 2016 Deals Vs Target, Walmart: Where Will You Find The Perfect HDTV, PS4, And Xbox One S Bundle?

Securing America’s Future Energy (SAFE) created the commission, dubbed the Commission on Autonomous Vehicle Testing and Safety, as a way to inform operators on the best practices and improve dialogue between operators and the public. See Also: Get ready for a thermonuclear autonomous ride-hailing war It comes at a delicate time for the autonomous car industry, two months after the fatal Tesla AutoPilot accident. Customer opinion on self-driving cars is at a low-point, with most drivers still not interested in a fully autonomous car. SAFE trying to galvanize public perception SAFE hopes a revitalized focus on safety will change public perception towards self-driving cars, which in turn could help regulations pass in the United States. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is in the process of setting regulations for self-driving, but if these regulations miss the mark, SAFE may be a strong lobby group for automakers and tech firms to get autonomous cars legalized quicker. The autonomous car industry already has a few lobby groups set up in Washington. Uber, Ford, Google, Lyft, Volvo and GM have all increased the amount spent on lobbying for autonomous car assurances, including less regulations. SAFE has good reason for wanting legalization and adoption of self-driving, most reports say it reduce cars on the road by half. Operators like Google, Uber, and Tesla are also focused on all-electric vehicles, reducing the monopoly oil has in the automotive market. The U.S. could be one of the first countries to adopt fully autonomous (Level 5) driving, but the public opinion may delay the NHTSA ruling. We suspect forward thinking states like California and Michigan will be open doors sooner, followed by federal legalization.

Google “fund charges” and there’s about 232 million results. Try “benefits of active management” and there’s only four million. So there’s a lot more interest in cutting investment costs than in improving net returns. Indeed, figures from the Investment Association show that private investors have been dumping actively managed funds for “passive” (index tracking) funds in ever increasing numbers over the past few years. Five years ago, I attended a pensions seminar where an actuary suggested that “because only 25 per cent of active funds can outperform index trackers, pension fund trustees shouldn’t waste their time trying to spot winners”. Now let’s for a moment assume that she was accurate. Right now in the UK All Companies sector of unit trusts – so ignoring investment trusts for now – there are 240 funds with at least a five-year record. Adding in UK equity income funds there are another 68, so simple arithmetic says there are 77 funds that are worth finding. Over ten years there are 238 funds, so only 60 worth tracking down. Does that sound difficult to you? “Evidence-based” experts claim it’s a mathematical fact that you can’t beat a low-cost tracker, ever. But these funds simply mirror an index whether it makes sense or not. When the index falls 50 per cent, a tracker follows. Ouch. Wise men say “only fools rush in” and that you should buy low and sell high. Index trackers do the opposite, because there’s no thought process. Presumably that’s why they’re so cheap. Or are they? Money Management magazine checked the actual performance of UK index trackers over the past three, five and 10 years and found that the four biggest funds, with £23 billion invested, were consistently way below average. The biggest of them over three years managed to lag behind 209 other funds out of 308 (even after charges). It gets worse. Advocates of tracker funds keep referring to low costs in their “mathematical facts”, conveniently ignoring that many of those supporters are charging clients a 1 per cent a year management fee plus platform charges of at least 0.35 per cent a year on top. That’s how we recently came across someone who’d actually lost 16 per cent sitting in a cheap “passive strategy” since April 2013. So the point is this. While I accept there are “active” funds that don’t justify their charges, particularly those that are actually closet trackers but charging full whack for doing sod all, there are many that do justify them. Well managed active funds have been delivering superior returns consistently over the past 30 years. Don’t take my word for it, check it out. Then you will be in a position to truly judge for yourself.

');//--> } Home Wealth Management Speaking Book Contact Intelligent Technology September 10, 2016 3:00pm by Guest Author Intelligent Technology Hal Varian FINANCE & DEVELOPMENT, September 2016, Vol. 53, No. 3       As digital applications encroach on various aspects of daily life, the impact on the economy will help us live smarter and better A computer now sits in the middle of virtually every economic transaction in the developed world. Computing technology is rapidly penetrating the developing world as well, driven by the rapid spread of mobile phones. Soon the entire planet will be connected, and most economic transactions worldwide will be computer mediated. Data systems that were once put in place to help with accounting, inventory control, and billing now have other important uses that can improve our daily life while boosting the global economy. Transmission routes Computer mediation can impact economic activity through five important channels. Data collection and analysis: Computers can record many aspects of a transaction, which can then be collected and analyzed to improve future transactions. Automobiles, mobile phones, and other complex devices collect engineering data that can be used to identify points of failure and improve future products. The result is better products and lower costs. Personalization and customization: Computer mediation allows services that were previously one-size-fits-all to become personalized to satisfy individual needs. Today we routinely expect that online merchants we have dealt with previously possess relevant information about our purchase history, billing preferences, shipping addresses, and other details. This allows transactions to be optimized for individual needs. Experimentation and continuous improvement: Online systems can experiment with alternative algorithms in real time, continually improving performance. Google, for example, runs over 10,000 experiments a year dealing with many different aspects of the services it provides, such as ranking and presentation of search results. The experimental infrastructure to run such experiments is also available to the company’s advertisers, who can use it to improve their own offerings. Contractual innovation: Contracts are critical to economic transactions, but without computers it was often difficult or costly to monitor contractual performance. Verifying performance can help alleviate problems with asymmetric information, such as moral hazard and adverse selection, which can interfere with efficient transactions. There is no longer a risk of purchasing a “lemon” car if vehicular monitoring systems can record history of use and vehicle health at minimal cost. Coordination and communication: Today even tiny companies with a handful of employees have access to communication services that only the largest multinationals could afford 20 years ago. These micro-multinationals can operate on a global scale because the cost of computation and communication has fallen dramatically. Mobile devices have enabled global coordination of economic activity that was extremely difficult just a decade ago. For example, today authors can collaborate on documents simultaneously even when they are located thousands of miles apart. Videoconferencing is now essentially free, and automated document translation is improving dramatically. As mobile technology becomes ubiquitous, organizations will become more flexible and responsive, allowing them to improve productivity. Let us dig deeper into these five channels through which computers are changing our lives and our economy. Data collection and analysis We hear a lot about “big data” (see “Big Data’s Big Muscle,” in this issue of F&D), but “small data” can be just as important, if not more so. Twenty years ago only large companies could afford sophisticated inventory management systems. But now every mom-and-pop corner store can track its sales and inventory using intelligent cash registers, which are basically just personal computers with a drawer for cash. Small business owners can handle their own accounting using packaged software or online services, allowing them to better track their business performance. Indeed, these days data collection is virtually automatic. The challenge is to translate that raw data into information that can be used to improve performance. Large businesses have access to unprecedented amounts of data, but many industries have been slow to use it, due to lack of experience in data management and analysis. Music and video entertainment have been distributed online for more than a decade, but the entertainment industry has been slow to recognize the value of the data collected by servers that manage this distribution (see “Music Going for a Song,” in this issue of F&D). The entertainment industry, driven by competition from technology companies, is now waking up to the possibility of using this data to improve their products. The automotive industry is also evolving quickly by adding sensors and computing power to its products. Self-driving cars are rapidly becoming a reality. In fact, we would have self-driving cars now if it weren’t for the randomness introduced by human drivers and pedestrians. One solution to this problem would be restricted lanes for autonomous vehicles only. Self-driving cars can communicate among themselves and coordinate in ways that human drivers are (alas) unable to. Autonomous vehicles don’t get tired, they don’t get inebriated, and they don’t get distracted. These features of self-driving cars will save millions of lives in the coming years. Personalization and customization Twenty years ago it was a research challenge for computers to recognize pictures containing human beings. Now free photo storage systems can find pictures with animals, mountains, castles, flowers, and hundreds of other items in seconds. Improved facial recognition technology and automated indexing allow the photos to be found and organized easily and quickly. Similarly, just in the past few years voice recognition systems have become significantly more accurate. Voice communication with electronic devices is possible now and will soon become the norm. Real-time verbal language translation is a reality in the lab and will be commonplace in the near future. Removing language barriers will lead to increased foreign trade, including, of course, tourism. Continuous improvement Observational data can uncover interesting patterns and correlations in data. But the gold standard for discovering causal relationships is experimentation, which is why online companies like Google routinely experiment and continuously improve their systems. When transactions are mediated by computers, it is easy to divide users into treatment and control groups, deploy treatment, and analyze outcomes in real time. Companies now routinely use this kind of experimentation for marketing purposes, but these techniques can be used in many other contexts. For example, institutions such as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab have been able to run controlled experiments of proposed interventions in developing economies to alleviate poverty, improve health, and raise living standards. Randomized controlled experiments can be used to resolve questions about what sorts of incentives work best for increasing saving, educating children, managing small farms, and a host of other policies. Contractual innovation The traditional business model for advertising was “You pay me to show your ad to people, and some of them might come to your store.” Now in the online world, the model is “I’ll show your ad to people, and you only have to pay me if they come to your website.” The fact that advertising transactions are computer mediated allows merchants to pay only for the outcome they care about. Consider the experience of taking a taxi in a strange city. Is this an honest driver who will take the best route and charge me the appropriate fee? At the same time, the driver may well have to worry whether the passenger is honest and will pay for the ride. This is a one-time interaction, with limited information on both sides and potential for abuse. But now consider technology such as that used by Lyft, Uber, and other ride services. Both parties can see rating history, both parties can access estimates of expected fares, and both parties have access to maps and route planning. The transaction has become more transparent to all parties, enabling more efficient and effective transactions. Riders can enjoy cheaper and more convenient trips, and drivers can enjoy a more flexible schedule. Smartphones have disrupted the taxi industry by enabling these improved transactions, and every player in the industry is now offering such capabilities—or will soon. Many people see the conflict between ride services and the taxi industry as one of innovators versus regulators. However, from a broader perspective, what matters is which technology wins. The technology used by rideshare companies clearly provides a better experience for both drivers and passengers, so it will likely be widely adopted by traditional taxi services. Simply being able to capture transaction history can improve contracts (see “Two Faces of Change,” in this issue of F&D). It is remarkable that I can walk into a bank in a new city, where I know no one and no one knows me, and arrange for a mortgage worth millions of dollars. This is enabled by credit rating services, which dramatically reduce risk on both sides of the transaction, making loans possible for people who otherwise could not get them. Communication and coordination Recently I had some maintenance work done on my house. The team of workers used their mobile phones to photograph items that needed replacement, communicate with their colleagues at the hardware store, find their way to the job site, use as a flashlight to look in dark places, order lunch for delivery, and communicate with me. All of these formerly time-consuming tasks can now be done quickly and easily. Workers spend less time waiting for instructions, information, or parts. The result is reduced transaction costs and improved efficiency. Today only the wealthy can afford to employ executive assistants. But in the future everyone will have access to digital assistant services that can search through vast amounts of information and communicate with other assistants to coordinate meetings, maintain records, locate data, plan trips, and do the dozens of other things necessary to get things done (see “Robots, Growth, and Inequality,” in this issue of F&D). All of the big tech companies are investing heavily in this technology, and we can expect to see rapid progress thanks to competitive pressure. Putting it all together Today’s mobile phones are many times more powerful and much less expensive than those that powered Apollo 11, the 1969 manned expedition to the moon. These mobile phone components have become “commoditized.” Screens, processors, sensors, GPS chips, networking chips, and memory chips cost almost nothing these days. You can buy a reasonable smartphone now for $50, and prices continue to fall. Smartphones are becoming commonplace even in very poor regions. The availability of those cheap components has enabled innovators to combine and recombine these components to create new devices—fitness monitors, virtual reality headsets, inexpensive vehicular monitoring systems, and so on. The Raspberry Pi is a $35 computer designed at Cambridge University that uses mobile phone parts with a circuit board the size of a pack of playing cards. It is far more powerful than the Unix workstations of just 15 years ago. The same forces of standardization, modularization, and low prices are driving progress in software. The hardware created using mobile phone parts often uses open-source software for its operating system. At the same time, the desktop motherboards from the personal computer era have now become components in vast data centers, also running open-source software. The mobile devices can hand off relatively complex tasks such as image recognition, voice recognition, and automated translation to the data centers on an as-needed basis. The availability of cheap hardware, free software, and inexpensive access to data services has dramatically cut entry barriers for software development, leading to millions of mobile phone applications becoming available at nominal cost. The productivity puzzle I have painted an optimistic picture of how technology will impact the global economy. But how will this technological progress show up in conventional economic statistics? Here the picture is somewhat mixed. Take GDP, for example. This is usually defined as the market value of all final goods and services produced in a given country in a particular time period. The catch is “market value”—if a good isn’t bought and sold, it generally doesn’t show up in GDP. This has many implications. Household production, ad-supported content, transaction costs, quality changes, free services, and open-source software are dark matter as far as GDP is concerned, since technological progress in these areas does not show up directly in GDP. Take, for example, ad-supported content, which is widely used to support provision of online media. In the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis National Economic Accounts, advertising is treated as a marketing expense—an intermediate product—so it isn’t counted as part of GDP. A content provider that switches from a pay-per-view business model to an ad-supported model reduces GDP. One example of technology making a big difference to productivity is photography. Back in 2000, about 80 billion photos were taken worldwide—a good estimate since only three companies produced film then. In 2015, it appears that more than 1.5 trillion photos were taken worldwide, roughly 20 times as many. At the same time the volume exploded, the cost of photos fell from about 50 cents each for film and developing to essentially zero. So over 15 years the price fell to zero and output went up 20 times. Surely that is a huge increase in productivity. Unfortunately, most of this productivity increase doesn’t show up in GDP, since the measured figures depend on the sales of film, cameras, and developing services, which are only a small part of photography these days. In fact, when digital cameras were incorporated into smartphones, GDP decreased, camera sales fell, and smartphone prices continued to decline. Ideally, quality adjustments would be used to measure the additional capabilities of mobile phones. But figuring out the best way to do this and actually incorporating these changes into national income accounts is a challenge. Even if we could accurately measure the number of photos now taken, most are produced at home and distributed to friends and family at zero cost; they are not bought and sold and don’t show up in GDP. Nevertheless, those family photos are hugely valuable to the people who take them. The same thing happened with global positioning systems (GPS). In the late 1990s, the trucking industry adopted expensive GPS and vehicular monitoring systems and saw significant increases in productivity as a result. In the past 10 years, consumers have adopted GPS for home use. The price of the systems has fallen to zero, since they are now bundled with smartphones, and hundreds of millions of people use such systems on a daily basis. But as with cameras, the integration of GPS with smartphones has likely reduced GDP, since sales of stand-alone GPS systems have fallen. As in the case of cameras, this measurement problem could be solved by implementing a quality adjustment for smartphones. But it is tricky to know exactly how to do this, and statistical agencies want a system that will stand the test of time. Even after the quality adjustment problem is worked out, the fact that most photos are not exchanged for cash will remain—that isn’t a part of GDP, and technological improvements in that area are just not measured by conventional statistics. Will the promise of technology be realized? When the entire planet is indeed connected, everyone in the world will, in principle, have access to virtually all human knowledge. The barriers to full access are not technological but legal and economic. Assuming that these issues can be resolved, we can expect to see a dramatic increase in human prosperity. But will these admittedly utopian hopes be realized? I believe that technology is generally a force for good—but there is a dark side to the force (see “The Dark Side of Technology,” in this issue of F&D). Improvements in coordination technology may help productive enterprises but at the same time improve the efficiency of terrorist organizations. The cost of communication may drop to zero, but people will still disagree, sometimes violently. In the long run, though, if technology enables broad improvement in human welfare, people might devote more time to enlarging the pie and less to squabbling over the size of the pieces. ■ PDF version Spread the wealth. twitter facebook linkedin What's been said: Discussions found on the web: Read this next.
