With Map Maker closed, road segment editing is available to all users on Google Maps Rita El Khoury Follow View All Posts 2017/05/04 8:49am PDTMay 4, 2017 24 Plus 1 on G+ 57 Share on Facebook 46 Share on Twitter Total Shares127 Applications Google News Map Maker was completely shut down on April 2nd¬†and at the time, Google promised that¬†its features would find their way to the main Google Maps app. Part of¬†them was implemented long ago last September¬†with the addition of missing info and fact checking cards, but that left the main Map Maker function of editing road segments. It¬†was enabled for Local Guides a while ago and according to a post on the Local Guides Connect community, it has been made available for everyone on April 27. Sure enough, I checked on my phone and I can see the option to edit road segments. You have to open the side menu, scroll down to¬†Send Feedback, and choose¬†Edit the map. After that, you can pick any road segment and suggest a new name, say the road is 1- or 2-way, tell it the road is closed, and so on. I'm not sure how long¬†these options have been there for ‚Äî we're inclined to think at least a couple of months, depending on your Local Guide level ‚Äî but they appear to be accessible¬†to everyone since April 27. They might¬†seem a little hidden away under the¬†Send Feedback menu (that's usually a section users don't venture into that often), but it's probably precisely for that reason that they've been tucked there. You don't want any and all Maps users to suggest edits for the fun of it without knowing what they're doing.

The only real difference now is when you're reporting an issue with how a road is drawn or two-way status or something like that (something you could always do), you can now directly select which road segment you're talking about to make your report more clear instead of trying to describe the location. And there's still no way to report issues with lane guidance (aside from typing it in as a note on a report that is labeled as something completely unrelated to lane guidance), which has about a 2% accuracy rate around here.... catalysto Works for me. XerBlade Really? Because I just read through Google's official article introducing this "road editing" and how this works, and it was exactly what I just described. In other words, they are stretching the meaning of "editing roads" to the extreme. Literally the ONLY difference between what you could do before and what you can do now is you can select multiple road segments when making a report instead of just dropping a pin on a single spot. The reports themselves are the same. No actual editing any roads. Morten Ulv Map maker was never available in my country and reporting this way works great. Issues are usually fixed within a week. Getting these better tools now is just a bonus for me. iMarbot Like I said months ago. Google lied about bringing MapMaker into Maps. You simply cannot do anything as comprehensive. Ome Dries Despite the few pranks people pulled with Map Maker, I think it was a great product and a very important factor for Google Map's success. Were other maps (including the paid maps on my navigation system) are always outdated, not containing new roads or still having older roads, and almost almost missing details in roads (and bike roads) Google Maps was always better. It's an advantage they could now be loosing, because even with today's update they don't have a full substitute for Map Maker. PANDAMONIUMüöÄ Since they restricted Map Maker I've found Google Maps to be very very slow in updating roads that have been recently paved or changed due to construction or new construction. Waze is a better option now for a more accurate navigation experience in my area. And their map editing tools are far superior. They also are heavily moderated, but they didn't do what Google did with Maps. Google just took a machete and cut off the whole limb because of a few bad apples. All they needed to do was follow Waze's guidelines and they'd be set. utack >Google Maps was always better I am guessing your sample size is only USA on this? Anjo Cerde√±a It's still available for select regions only.

But the reason I said we don't know when these started showing up is because they might have popped up before they were announced on the Connect community. Google isn't always fast in acknowledging something is happening and we've often covered features for Local Guides that weren't yet officially announced.

Right now there isn't much you can do besides the few options you listed in the article. For the rest you need to write a note, which doesn't seem very efficient.

The relatives assert that by allowing ISIS militants to spread propaganda freely on social media, the three companies provided "material support" to the group and enabled attacks such as the one in San Bernardino. "For years defendants have knowingly and recklessly provided the terrorist group ISIS with accounts to use its social networks as a tool for spreading extremist propaganda, raising funds and attracting new recruits," family members of Sierra Clayborn, Tin Nguyen and Nicholas Thalasinos charge in the 32-page complaint, which was filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles on Wednesday. Subscribe to Newsweek from $1 per week "Without defendants Twitter, Facebook and Google (YouTube), the explosive growth of ISIS over the last few years into the most feared terrorist group in the world would not have been possible," the complaint said. Spokeswomen for Twitter and Google declined to comment on the lawsuit. Representatives for Facebook could not immediately be reached by Reuters on Thursday afternoon. Syed Rizwan Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, opened fire on a holiday gathering of Farook's co-workers at a government building in San Bernardino on Dec. 2, 2015, killing 14 people and wounding 22 others. Farook, the 28-year-old, U.S.-born son of Pakistani immigrants, and Malik, 29, a Pakistani native, died in a shootout with police four hours after the massacre. Authorities have said the couple was inspired by Islamist militants. At the time, the assault ranked as the deadliest attack by Islamist extremists on U.S. soil since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. In June 2016, an American-born gunman pledging allegiance to the leader of ISIS shot 49 people to death at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida¬†before he was killed by police. In December 2016 the families of three men killed at the nightclub sued Twitter, Google and Facebook in federal court on allegations similar to those in the California lawsuit. Federal law gives internet companies broad immunity from liability for content posted by their users. A number of lawsuits have been filed in recent years seeking to hold social media companies responsible for terror attacks, but none has advanced beyond the preliminary phases.

BlackBerry KEYone review: A tale of a decent phone full of annoyances Jordan Palmer Follow View All Posts 2017/05/04 6:00am PDTMay 4, 2017 9 Plus 1 on G+ 19 Share on Facebook 47 Share on Twitter Total Shares75 Blackberry KEYone News Phone Reviews Reviews Article Contents 1 Specs 2 The Good 3 The Not So Good 4 Design & build¬†quality 5 Display 6 Battery life 7 Audio 8 Call quality & connectivity 9 Camera 10 Software 10.1 BlackBerry apps 10.2 Settings & general UI 10.3 Performance 11 Value 12 Conclusion The KEYone, the latest in the BlackBerry Ltd/TCL collaboration, is a phone that returns to the Canadian brand's iconic roots, for better or for worse. With Nougat and a strong focus on security, the KEYone is aimed at enterprise users and long-time fanatics. Overall, the spec sheet for this phone is nothing chart-topping. The SoC is over a year old at this point and the screen has been downgraded from the year-and-a-half-old Priv's, but using the KEYone was¬†mostly a pleasant experience until after about a week¬†with it. That was when I started experiencing rather noticeable slowdown and other problems. So what does a proverbial return to form for BlackBerry mean in the ever massive Android space? Well, there's not really a simple answer. But let's get going ‚Äî¬†we've got a lot to cover. You don't want to be here all day, do you? The unit that I've been using for the last week and some change¬†is pre-production. There have been a few hiccups with the software along the way, which I'll note in the appropriate section below. Most of these problems will hopefully¬†be fixed before the KEYone¬†is available for sale. Specs Display 4.5" IPS LCD 1620 x 1080; 434 ppi CPU Snapdragon 625 GPU Adreno 506 Software Android 7.1.1 Nougat; BlackBerry Security RAM 3GB Storage 32GB, expandable via microSD Cameras 12MP IMX378 (1.55Œºm) rear, 8MP front Battery 3,505mAh; Quick Charge 3.0 Misc USB Type-C 3.1, fingerprint sensor, 3.5mm jack, physical keyboard, NFC Connectivity 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac, dual-band; Bluetooth 4.2; LTE bands 1/2/3/4/5/7/12/13/20/25/26/28/29/30 Measurements 149.3 x 72.5 x 9.4 mm; 180 g Buy BlackBerry The Good Software The "stock" take on Android with BlackBerry's apps is great. It feels like what Motorola does: functionality added on top of Google's vision. It has the latest security patch and Android 7.1.1. Battery life My time with phones from the likes of Huawei and Xiaomi has somewhat desensitized me to stellar battery life, but the KEYone is definitely above average. Screen The color accuracy, brightness, and viewing angles are spectacular. The screen crisp and more than adequate, despite its odd size and aspect ratio. Fingerprint sensor I am not sure from where the fingerprint sensor was sourced, but it's almost on Huawei's level for speed and accuracy. Seriously, my success rate has been almost perfect. Build quality The KEYone is one hell of a solid device. The aluminium frame combined with the soft-touch back make the phone feel extremely durable. The Not So Good Ergonomics/weight The KEYone is chunky and is a bit difficult to hold. Typing with one hand on¬†the physical keyboard is also a pain. And even though it's only 180 grams, the KEYone feels very dense and heavy. Using it single-handed is not a pleasant experience for long periods. Speaker I know this should go without saying, but the speaker quality¬†on this phone is pretty terrible. Performance Major lag, homescreen redraws, and RAM management issues led to a phone that, after about a week of use, became almost unusable. Design & build¬†quality To give you some perspective on the KEYone and its design,¬†the marketing materials say that the phone is "Distinctly different. Distinctly BlackBerry." That last part, and to an extent the first, is quite true. BlackBerry (well, it's really TCL, but you know what I mean) has opted for what you might call the quintessential look that defined the heyday of Research In Motion. And while that seems like a negative at first glance, the KEYone's design exhibits¬†some modernization in its overall execution. This phone garnered more looks, comments, and questions in my time with it than any other I've used¬†‚Äî I'd say that it comes close to the amount of attention I received when smartwatches were still young. The physical keyboard is what drew people's eyes. The whole front face would throw anyone for a loop, especially when we're starting to see such high screen-to-body ratios these days. Not a single person that I've come across thinks that this is a pretty device... and I agree with them. The KEYone is not beautiful, elegant, slim, or anything else like that; it is aimed at a niche that, in theory, cares little for those things in a pocket computer. From the back, the phone looks fairly unassuming and normal. The soft-touch finish¬†feels¬†like it was ripped off of the good ol' OG Nexus 7. My fingertips glide across the band-aid texture, but when push comes to shove, my hand grips it solidly. Coupled with an aluminium frame, the KEYone feels sturdy, durable... and like a brick. To put this¬†kindly, it is one hell of a chunky phone¬†‚Äî I actually had 2010-2011 phone era flashbacks when I removed it¬†from the box. At 180 grams (6.35 ounces for you Imperial folks), the KEYone gets quite heavy in the hand after prolonged usage. See, I have this odd tendency to support phones with my little finger¬†while I'm using them; BlackBerry has made me decide to try to break that habit. I know that I mentioned it briefly, but let's talk seriously about the KEYone's keyboard. When smartphones were starting to trend toward on-screen keyboards, I was not happy. I liked the tactile response of my Droid and Droid 2, and haptic feedback was just not as satisfying. I had also not learned to type without looking on my G1 or HTC Hero, a problem I did not have with any of my Droids or BlackBerries. I eventually got over myself and became a solid fan of SwiftKey and the navbar¬†that Google brought to Android with Ice Cream Sandwich. Now that I'm all done reminiscing, let's get back to the topic at hand. The KEYone's backlit keyboard is really good, if not a little weird after spending the last several years with a¬†software variant. If I were a keyboard nerd like Ryan, I'd describe the travel distance, tactile feel, and the like ‚Äî I¬†just like my gaming mice and PC hardware. While the keys are much too small for my taste, I found that I actually had very few errors in general usage. Each one is easily pressed and responds with a solid click. The layout is obviously QWERTY (duh), so it's pretty easy to get to the point where you're typing fairly quickly. So far, the only things that have taken me some time to adjust to are the symbol layout and the placement of the left shift key versus ALT. Most of my errors have been activating the alternative mode instead of capitalizing the next letter. If you're into it, there are 52 programmable keyboard shortcuts that can open apps or contacts. For instance, you could assign a long press of 'c' to open Chrome, 'f' to start up Facebook, and so on. There's one catch, though: it's limited to the BlackBerry Launcher. In any other, long-pressing a letter will bring up a phone search for shortcuts and apps that are associated with that key. One of the other interesting features is the flick gesture, which inserts the first SwiftKey-like prediction when you, well, flick your thumb up the board. My biggest gripe about the keyboard is the fact that I have to see¬†it every¬†time that I am using the phone. Whereas the Priv has the sliding mechanism to mask its keyboard when you aren't using it, the KEYone's stares you in the face. This reduces the screen size to 4.5" and a 3:2 aspect ratio. I understand that this design choice was made¬†in the spirit of the BlackBerries of old, but I can't say that I am a fan. And if you don't like the physical keyboard or just don't want to use it all of the time, you can use the software version. However, unlike the Priv, this is not the best option. A full-screen keyboard on this smaller display is not the most pleasant of experiences. The fingerprint sensor is fantastic. Embedded in the space bar, it's lightning quick and very accurate. Only Huawei's sensors have proven so reliable for me, which should tell you something. The front of the phone has the screen, the capacitive navigation buttons, the keyboard, and the front camera (and earpiece/sensors) along the upper aluminium bezel. The back has the rather large camera module (there's still a hump, by the way, despite this thing being a brick) and BlackBerry logo. On the top of the frame, you will find the 3.5mm headphone jack. The left side only has the power button, while the bottom houses the speaker grilles and the USB Type-C 3.1 port. Finally, the right side is home to the SIM tray, volume rocker (which feels cheap and hollow) and what BlackBerry calls the "Convenience Key." Both it and the power button feel only slightly more solid than the volume rocker and I'd honestly rather see¬†one of them be textured or differentiated in some way from the other. Just because they're on opposite sides of the phone does not mean I didn't mix them up from time to time. The Convenience Key is a tertiary button that is customizable and can be mapped to almost any action you want. It can open a certain app, activate one of many shortcuts, or perform a few system functions like power off. At this moment, I have it mapped to Google Now since Assistant is tied to a long press of the home button. Let's just say that I've opened Now a lot more than I usually do. It's cool to see BlackBerry trying to¬†cater in some form to power users by adding in this key. At least this isn't chained to a useless virtual assistant. Overall, the KEYone is well-built, but it is a polarizing device in its design and construction. Some people will love it, while I think that most won't. It doesn't have the sneaky, incognito aspect that the Priv did, which is not necessarily a bad thing. Whether you like the look of the phone or not is entirely up to you¬†‚Äî I'm just not the biggest fan of it. Display When discussing the KEYone's display, most will inevitably focus on the aspect ratio, i.e. its general shape. BlackBerry went with something decidedly more square than what most of us are used to. Despite this, the 1620x1080 IPS panel is crisp, clear, and quite bright. I am rather¬†fond of the color reproduction, and I found this to be one of the more accurate panels that I've used. There's even an sRGB mode. The viewing angles are superb and the screen is just a joy to look at. It also gets very bright for outdoor use. The display is not the KEYone's strongest aspect, but nor is it the weakest. The resolution is more than adequate especially given the total screen size. There really isn't that much more to say on the matter: great screen, awesome colors, but it won't blow you away. Battery life With a 3,505mAh battery, you'd expect the KEYone to last a long time. I mean, that's one of the features that BlackBerry is hoping encourages¬†people to buy this phone. The good news is that it is certainly above average. After using Huawei and Xiaomi devices for the last few months, I have gotten used to a phone that can easily get me through a day, so I am glad that this one¬†continues the trend. During my testing, I had the screen at 100% brightness with plenty of texting, emailing, messaging, and several attempts to¬†watch YouTube videos and play games. Not only did I get over five hours of screen-on-time, but the idle drain on the battery was practically negligible. The largest battery to ever come in a BlackBerry phone and the screen resolution help to contribute to the¬†claim that you can get 26 hours of "mixed use," but if you run low, Qualcomm's Quick Charge 3.0 is supported. When you plug the phone in, you are presented with two options: Charge Only¬†and Boost Mode. The latter is touted as "giving you the most efficient charge possible, even if you only have a few minutes." Good on BlackBerry for making another phone with good battery life. It's pretty damn stellar. Audio When I¬†think of a BlackBerry, I don't always picture a phone with the best sound quality and output. Sure, it might get the job done, but you know what I mean. In all fairness, the KEYone is not meant to be your media player¬†‚Äî rather, it's not supposed to be the one on your desk that pleases your ears the most. It gets the job done, that's about all I can say. The sound that pushes out of the headphone jack is tolerable and works just fine for the gym or other activities where you won't be lugging around high fidelity cans. The external speaker is subpar, even considering that this is a smartphone. For music or notifications, there is plenty of distortion and crackling at 80%+ volume. The cacophony at that level is awful, so I've left the KEYone in vibrate-only most of the time. At least the phone has a good vibration motor. Call quality & connectivity When I first received the KEYone and inserted my SIM card, I was sorely unimpressed. Mobile data would not work due to a problem with the APN settings and the phone presented me with an annoying notification telling me that there was a problem. After some digging and chatting with "people in the know," I found out that this was a known issue with this¬†pre-production build of the software and it was being addressed in preparation for the final release. After manually setting up the APN for my MVNO carrier, my wireless connectivity has been passable. Call quality reached my expectations¬†‚Äî Bluetooth and WiFi have also been reliable. I have had my LG Watch Urbane (Android Wear 2.0), Moto 360, and Samsung Gear S3 connected to it during my entire usage. None have had any issues staying connected, nor did I have trouble with any of the Bluetooth headsets I tried. Reception, however, was another matter entirely. The phone constantly dropped calls or failed to make them at all. I also frequently lost data connection or experienced slower speeds than what I am used to on my carrier. The KEYone also experienced cell signal holes that have never been there¬†‚Äî I went through a hole near my house every day, but all of my other devices were just fine in the same area (same SIM, etc). It was extremely frustrating. Camera I'll admit: I went into all of this not expecting much from the camera. Come on, it's a BlackBerry. But seriously, the KEYone's is legitimately good. It performs well in low-light environments with post-processing that is kind to photos. I'm certainly glad to see BlackBerry carry on where the Priv's camera left off. With all of that being said, it cannot¬†quite¬†hold its own next to¬†the Pixel, GS8/GS7, or even the P10. The KEYone can put out good-quality pictures that are crisp in detail, but with some aggressive smoothing in post-processing.¬†Those of you who pay attention will notice that the KEYone packs the same sensor as the Pixel, the IMX378. While that certainly can lend itself to good photos, it's not the be-all, end-all. My opinion is that this is one of those phones where it's more difficult to take a bad picture. This camera is like a jack-of-all-trades¬†‚Äî you'll get great outdoor, indoor, and nighttime photos. Will they have that so-called "Wow!" factor? Well, that depends on you. Moving around to the front, BlackBerry opted for an 8MP fixed focus, 84¬∞ wide angle shooter. LCD flash is also included. Supposedly, this is best suited for those video conferences where you're not in a position to get somewhere with better lighting. This is the official blurb on the matter: "For times when you have to take a video conference on the go, the device includes an 8MP front camera with fixed focus, LCD flash, and 84-degree wide angle lens." Just own up to the fact that you put in an LCD flash for selfies; there's nothing wrong with that. Wrapping all of this up, let's go over the camera UI. It's basic, but in a good way. In Auto, you are presented with the upper bar that has the settings for flash, timer, aspect ratio, and HDR, as well as¬†the general options. Along the bottom is the gallery preview, front/rear camera switcher, shutter button, mode selection, and visual effects. In the options, you have the control mode, where you choose between auto and manual. Then there's the JPEG fine or standard compression choices, face detection, and video resolution stuff. The KEYone¬†can go all the way up to 4K30fps, but you lose "enhanced video stabilization" above 1080p30, which is kind of a bummer. Contrast this camera app UI with something from Huawei and you'll see why I am a huge fan. There aren't as many options, but what's there is useful and mostly necessary. Good job, BlackBerry. Previous Next Software When the Priv launched a year and a half ago, the general consensus seemed to be that the software was good. Much like Motorola and OnePlus, BlackBerry has gone with a "stock+" take on Android, i.e. where Google's vision is kept intact, but useful features are added on top to better the user experience. The KEYone follows the same logic, though with Nougat 7.1.1 running underneath¬†this time around. The BlackBerry brand is built on security, reliability, and stability. When the company shifted over to Android from the corpse that was BB OS, it brought with it some of the hallmarks upon which it had built its reputation. There was a commitment to updating to¬†the latest monthly security patches, the DTEK security suite, and even some hardware modifications that all helped to ensure users had the safest and most secure take on Android. Now we're here with the KEYone and that focus is still on-point. On the surface, the software looks like stock Android, but there's a bunch running under the hood, from the apps to the settings and options. I'll go through both¬†of those elements in their own sub-sections to follow. I think you'll be as surprised as I was in regard to the level of depth and detail with each addition made. Not all of it is useful, in my opinion, but it's there. BlackBerry apps This is one of the pillars for¬†BlackBerry's plan to draw potential customers. My time with BlackBerry's¬†phones was so long ago that I hardly remember what BB OS was like (and I never even used v10). Even if I did, I can tell you right now that I was not a hardcore user, so the KEYone gave me my first experience with a lot of the apps that BlackBerry loyalists swear by. The Hub app is where it's at, at least in terms of sheer power user capability. This functions as a place where you can see all of your messages, emails, texts, and other related¬†notifications. It pulls from Gmail, your default SMS app, IM services, and various social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, and LinkedIn. Due to the volume of incoming emails and the email-fu that I am forced to do each day, I ignore Gmail in Hub. It was just too difficult since it still doesn't support the tabbed inbox or filters/labels as well as I'd like. You can also set up custom views for Hub, where you select what accounts will show up¬†‚Äî this is how I was able to successfully "ignore" Gmail. For enterprise users, this could be the way you separate your work and personal data. While this is all great, I frankly got bored when trying to make Hub work to my advantage. It can take a lot of work, time, and effort to get it the way you want it. I have no doubt that some people will do this, because there is much power to be had in the app, but it is not for everyone. ¬† Nipping at the heels¬†of Hub in terms of marketing importance, we have DTEK. Though it's still being hyped just like it was when the Priv launched, it¬†remains a mostly useless, feel-good example of the placebo effect. You're presented with red Xs, yellow exclamation points, and green check-marks that denote your level of security in various areas. It's a centralized location to show the average user the basics of Android security, which isn't a bad thing. I suppose I am shrugging it off because I know what I'm doing when it comes to this stuff and my perfectionist/completionist nature hates not seeing green check marks. Since I am not going to change my usage habits, then I might as well not look at annoying yellow exclamation points. For those of you who are wondering what my DTEK status is, I am sitting firmly at "Fair." As annoying as that is, at least I am using¬†a BlackBerry device (because that's one of the security checks). I can sleep a bit better tonight knowing that. If you hit green on all criteria, then your needle will be in the "Excellent" range on the gauge. Good for you. ¬† DTEK is actually worth a damn when it comes to showing what apps are accessing certain permissions and notifying you when they do. Or¬†you can have it¬†inform you when a specific application is requesting certain permissions. For example, I can tell DTEK to let me know¬†when something accesses my calendar or to notify¬†me when Action Launcher alone tries to read it. There are certain people who will love this¬†‚Äî I am not one of them. BBM is here, for some reason. It's still the same old app and I really don't feel like going over it. Basically, if you use BBM then you know what it is. If you don't, you're not missing much. There's still no SMS functionality; Android¬†Messages is your default out of the box. The Calendar app is cool, I guess. It still has the "Meeting Mode," which automatically silences your phone when you're in a meeting according to your calendar. There are also options for creating events in different time zones from the system one and whether or not the app informs you if events conflict. It's a neat take, but I wouldn't call it special. Finally, there are various note-taking, task, password management, and photo markup apps. None are particularly worth paying attention to¬†and I am sure there are better offerings from either Google or other third-party developers. I don't want to waste too much time with them. Settings & general UI Apps are great and all, but what about overall user interface? Like I said, the software is "stock+" Android. It looks, feels, and functions much like Nougat would on a Nexus or Pixel, but there are additional options¬†to play with. Most of them lie in the display settings menu, so I'll address some of them. There's the color balance slider (for cool or warm, or somewhere in between) How you want the Recents menu to look ‚Äî you have the choice of Rolodex, which is the normal way, Tiles, and Masonry A green bar along the edge of the screen that shows the battery level¬†remaining while charging (it's neat and I've seen it before in custom ROMs) An option to double tap to wake/sleep the phone. There's one final piece that I want to address in more detail. It's called the Productivity Tab and it exists as a small white bar on the far right edge of the screen (its position and thickness can be adjusted). If you've used Action Launcher and the Quickpage feature, then that's basically¬†how this works. If you have no idea what I'm talking about, the Productivity Tab pulls out from the side of the screen and has five sections. The first is a calendar widget showing you what you have going on that day or the next. After that¬†is a Hub shortcut to show you any unread messages. Sections 3 and 4 are a todo and contacts list, respectively. Finally, there's a settings sub-menu for the Tab, where you adjust position, transparency, height, thickness, etc. I like the Productivity Tab for little more than the calendar widget, which is exactly what I use the Quickpage for in my default Action Launcher setup. ¬†¬† The other addition you'll see in the system settings is for the Convenience Key, which I mentioned all the way back up closer to the top of this review. It's the thing under the volume rocker that looks/feels exactly like the power button. Oh, yeah, you can map it to open whatever app or shortcut you want. I find it mostly useless. but some may find it to their liking. The sub-menu itself is pretty straightforward: it shows you what the key does, what action is currently assigned to it, the option to clear said action, and a short list of what you can map to it. Here's what's available to choose: "Open app" will bring up a list of everything you have installed "Speed dial" allows you to set a contact to the key (don't do this) "Send message" allows you to open either an email or a text to send to a specific contact "All shortcuts" brings up a long list of all the shortcuts that BlackBerry thinks you could ever use/need. Once you make your choice, that's what the Convenience Key will do until you select something else. It only works when the screen is on and unlocked, so keep that in mind. There's a gestures section, but it only has the toggle for the double-tap power button for camera shortcut. Not sure why this is off on¬†its own, but whatever. The sound settings still has the "Notify during calls" and "Flip to mute" options¬†‚Äî I disabled the former because who needs that. The security area is actually almost stock, except for the picture password. By the way, skip that, too. Developer options has the sRGB mode toggle I mentioned earlier (which always turns itself off when I back out of the menu), but it's missing the OEM unlock entry. Because this is BlackBerry, so no unlocking or rooting for you. Everything else is all the same as a Nexus or Pixel. BlackBerry Launcher, the default out of the box, is pretty basic. You have the option for those keyboard shortcuts and little else of note. After I toyed around with it for a bit, I moved¬†on to Action Launcher. The notification shade and Quick Settings are also just like stock with the same animations and everything. ¬† If you're super paranoid about people peering¬†over your shoulder to look at the stuff on your screen, BlackBerry provides you with the Privacy Shade (via the Play Store). This prevents others¬†from physically seeing private and sensitive content by blocking out everything except for a tiny viewing area. How big this little window is depends on what size you want, but even with Privacy Shade active, you can still interact with your screen. It's neat, I suppose. You can adjust the shape and background transparency via the little menu that appears when the Shade is active. Performance The Snapdragon 625 powering all of this is not too bad of a chip. Though decidedly midrange and a year old at this point, it carried the KEYone along better than I would have thought initially. However, after about a week, the lags, stutters, and hiccups started to settle in, with the most noticeable being¬†exiting the camera app, constant homescreen redraws, and apps not remaining in memory very well. The camera thing was especially bad when I used the power button shortcut to launch the camera from a locked state; exiting after this caused the phone to hang for almost thirty seconds. Following that, there'd be another forty-five seconds of unresponsiveness, even from the fingerprint sensor or power button. Suffice to say, it was quite annoying and dismaying. I am not sure whether this is a bug in the pre-production software or not; regardless, it was irritating¬†and made using that shortcut more than useless. As time went on, the sheer sluggishness of the phone became quite apparent. Animations would lag, the whole OS would hang when launching apps at random intervals, and my homescreen redrew¬†every time I went back home (I used BlackBerry, Action, and Nova Launcher¬†‚Äî all with the same result). I also experienced some seriously aggressive RAM management/problems. As an example, I opened a new app for the first time and needed to sign in. I knew my password, but needed my 2FA code. Switching over to Authy, I grabbed the code and double-tapped the recents button to switch back to the original app... only to find that it needed to reload, requiring my credentials again. After all of that, the 2FA code had expired. Rinse and repeat; I just used Authy on my PC to get signed in after a near instance of rage quitting. That's just a singular example, but things like that happened often. Geekbench 4 was having troubles The Adreno 506 GPU¬†is pretty capable, though. The only problem is that there is no reason to game on this phone¬†‚Äî not only is the screen quite small for such an activity, but the keyboard and overall design of the phone's face make gaming uncomfortable. The GPU is just¬†wasted potential, I'd say. These issues could be related to this pre-production hardware and software, but there was a point at which the KEYone became unusable. These problems persisted through reboots. Performance for the first several days was quite good, but it deteriorated very rapidly. Surprisingly so, actually, which made the disappointment I felt seem worse. I should note that I will be retesting everything¬†with a production model when the phone¬†is released to see if these issues persist. Value As we near the end of this journey review, I'm left with a few¬†questions. The one I will ask and hopefully answer in this penultimate section is this: Is the KEYone worth it? Besides the horribly stylized name and physical keyboard, what is the value proposition of this phone? It will retail for $549 USD, which puts it at the high end of the midrange spectrum. That's still a hefty sum for a year-old SoC and some very fast performance degradation, even though both of those¬†come with a decent screen, good camera, and awesome overall software experience. Even with all of the security stuff and the keyboard, I am not entirely convinced that $549 is a good price. $349 is probably the most that I would pay for this phone, especially when you consider that a Pixel is $100 more than the asking price ($650) or that a OnePlus 3T starts at $440. Both phones come with better internals, a similar overall UI/UX, and better¬†cameras. What makes the MSRP even more painful is the subpar performance (note: again, this could be related to the pre-production hardware/software), something that I cannot in good conscience ignore or fail to mention in this regard. You will be much happier with what OnePlus, Google, and even Samsung have to offer you. BlackBerry is likely going to aim this at the enterprise, which may not care about the price tag as much as us normal consumers. Those users, however, do want a phone that's going to work well no matter what they're doing. The long and short of it is that if you're considering this phone as one of your options, then I'd say go with the OnePlus 3T as the best value for your money; if your budget is a little more flexible, then go with a Pixel or Galaxy S8. If you're really interested in one of these, just wait until they go on sale. Conclusion So who is the KEYone for, exactly? According to¬†BlackBerry, it's meant for: "people who use their phones more for communication rather than media consumption, people who are tired of having the same one¬†as everyone else, people who are professionals and rely on their phone to get things done, and people who are looking for something¬†durable that will last through a busy day." If you want my opinion (and you did just read this whole thing, so why wouldn't you), I would say that the KEYone is for the BlackBerry power user of yore. I never was one, but I do know a few who still¬†talk about their old phones. This phone is for them. Minus the DTEK50 and DTEK60, the KEYone is BlackBerry's (and TCL's) latest real attempt at the Android side of things since the Priv. From my time with it, the KEYone failed at providing a good user experience, even¬†though it is¬†a little eccentric and anachronistic in a cute way. BlackBerry returned to its roots with this phone, its aim fixed squarely on the¬†fans of old. Personally, I happen to prefer the glass slabs that we have nowadays and I think that the KEYone is a relic of a long bygone age. I eventually adjusted¬†to the form factor and physical keyboard, but even after reaching that point, I still did not enjoy typing (versus my current neutral feeling on the matter with the software versions). Simply put, I do not like the KEYone. I do, however, appreciate a solid, well-built device even if it is a brick. But good construction is only a single criterion when evaluating a device for recommendation and I don't think that the average consumer or even an Android nerd would enjoy using this phone. It's kind of ugly, bulky, dense, and one of the main draws, the keyboard, is a novelty at best. This is definitely a niche product and I usually frown on that because it's so limiting¬†‚Äî honestly, that's probably just the business student in me talking. BlackBerry/TCL clearly have a target market for the KEYone that they believe is slavering for it¬†(I am certainly not in it). That being said, narrowing down to a specific demographic does not excuse a poor user experience. I've said it plenty of times in this review, but I'll say it again: I know that the model I have¬†is pre-production hardware and software. Bugs, janks, and other oddities are to be expected. There was supposed to be an update for the review units, but I have not received it as of this writing. I like what the KEYone is trying to be and do.¬†It's a quirky little thing that was actually fun to use sometimes just because it's so different. The "stock+" Android¬†is also quite refreshing and helped to subdue some of my frustrations early on. But being unique with great¬†software cannot carry a phone through the trials that this phone presented. And no, the irony of this is not lost on me¬†‚Äî I usually get the phones with outstanding hardware and bogus software. The Snapdragon 625 is a decent chip in its own right; on paper, I should have never had the problems I did. Odds are, either you have already decided that you want one of these or your company's IT department will purchase them in bulk. In both of those cases, I wish you the best and hope that you have the best experience that this phone has to offer. Perhaps the issues I've had will be fixed with production hardware or a few software updates down the line, or maybe it's all been down to bad luck in the silicon lottery (#jordansluck). But I just have a feeling that the KEYone will go down as one of those Android phones that has a cult following, but is ultimately worth more in a few years as an antique than as a daily driver today.

It probably has its niche, but I agree that the era of the keyboard phone has passed, and for good reason. I'll take my big screen and easy one-handed typing, and honestly, I sincerely doubt I would ever be faster on a hardware keyboard. We're all so used to software boards and such autocomplete wizards that I bet 90% of people out there would never get close to matching their speed with a touchscreen on one of these chiclet boards. I also don't really think the camera seems like anything all that special, at least based on the samples here. Nick Becker Honestly, the physical keyboard was the only reason I was considering getting one of these. What I really want, though, is a new version of the HTC G2/Desire Z. YaKillaCJ I still have 1 in a drawer somewhere. That device was awesome and innovative. Hmm, maybe if HTC should look into the keyboard. Nick Becker I still have mine, too. It's just too old now for modern apps. Good_Ole_Pinocchio Phone with a 625... If you're not getting the Z Play, you're doing it wrong.... And well I completely agree with you on hardware keyboards being ridiculous in 2017 robogo Lenovo P2. Same specs, 5100 mAh battery. steadymobb Will the p2 ever get 7.0 though? Prob not... Sohit Especially considering the LG G6 is on sale for $500 Francois Nguyen I actually HATE most touchscreen keyboards, even if if's for typing small messages. I even hated landscape mechanical keyboards because I always break the sliding mechanism over time -_-. Being used to portrait mechanical keyboards (and old PC keyboards from the 90s) for so long, the only cellphones that lasted for me were a BB Q10 for 2 years (and a Palm Treo 680 for 5 years before that). I abused the heck out of Android Runtime for gathering my most needed apps. I tried iOS for 1 year and never got used to the keyboard. I tried several Android phones that didn't last 3 months for me. I'm glad now that the KEYone will show up in June 2017, even if it's WAY too late for me and I'm ironically not interested in buying it lol. Jack ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà mostly nostalgia. Honestly I will buy it if the price drops to $400 level YaKillaCJ My bet is the lags are due to stock 7.1.1. The 625 is very capable of everyday task proven by other OEMs. Something Xiaomi's Miui has a huge advantage over nearly everyone, optimization while including plethora of features. Proven by the Redmi Note 3 Pro (SD650) and Redmi Note 4x (SD625). Plus this price is just too much and I said it when it was announced. Yet so many nay sayers were upset at my comment siting its niche product. While a Niche allows it to be sold for more than Xiaomi and Huawei offerings, it doesn't justify pricing past Flagship specs. This cost more than OnePlus 3/T, ZTE Axon 7 & Xiaomi Mi5 that offer Flagship specs/hardware, thriving OEMs and update history. Not to mention Miui and OxygenOS. Blackberry should drop the price and use Android 7.0 instead until Google themselves stabilize Android 7.1.x. Miku is Best Vocaloid I don't think it's an issue with the Android version. My Moto Z Play has been running LineageOS ever since it became official and I haven't encountered any lag issues, even after a few weeks. If an unofficial version of 7.1 can run perfectly on the 625, there's no reason OEM 7.1 can't run properly on it. YaKillaCJ My key words were stock. As in they never optimized the Android software. Great examples is how Miui and OxygenOS takes whatever version and clearly tweak and optimize it. So I'm not surprised LOS runs great, it includes a modified/optimized kernel, drivers, blobs, default apps, etc tailored for your device. Throwing straight up stock versions of Android that basically just runs without optimization nor bug fixes is something TCL is known for. Look at Blu for example. HabsSuck what a hate on commentary, come to expect it from some HumbleButBlunt Although I agree with your comment I find it hilarious coming from someone who's screen name is "HabsSuck". DEVVVV Too bad BlackBerry continues to do what got them in trouble in the first place. this is due to total lack of innovation. Blackberry was a one hit wonder and if they don't get someone in there that possesses innovation they are done. HumbleButBlunt They are already done making devices... Nate650 Total lack of innovation!? This phone showcases innovation in many ways, such as the capacitive keyboard which they have a patent on. The same can't be said about the popular iPhone. All Apple has basically done in the last five generations is change the screen size. Michael Tran Does it have always listening "ok google" That would be a dealbreaker for me if it doesn't have it. Pat Richardson Your reasoning about the keyboard does not work for me. "Easy one hand typing" isn't even a thing anymore now that phones are 5.5" to 6" and touch/swype (word prediction selected "tofu") is a pain because of poor predictions. Since there is only one small flag ship phone (Sony xperis compact) one hand typing shouldn't even be an argument against a physical keyboard, which is more accurate, quick, and does not require looking at the keys. Every other word on swipe I swear I have to rewrite because of horrible predictions. And touch doing is no better since you cannot feel the keys I agree with everything else toy said about the phone though. Marcelove Start using Swiftkey and stop complaining...üòâ Pat Richardson That's funny because that's what I'm using ToniCipriani ‚úìp«ù·¥â…ü·¥â…π«ù å I used it. It's sh1t. As with every other bajillion VKB out there. I don't need keyboards that try to learn and output what it thinks I'm typing. I need a keyboard to output what I type, nothing more. Capacitive screens are inherently inaccurate. Imparus The size isn't really an argument when it comes to keyboard, pretty much every keyboard support "one hand" mode, where you can make it smaller, so even if it is big you can still reach all the letters with one hand. Pat Richardson While I can concede to this, phones are no longer small enough for one-hand general use. Trying to tap that top right button with your left hand puts you at risk of dropping your phone, so you mostly operate your phone with two hands anyway. To make a keyboard smaller for one hand typing is counter-intuitive for a screen size that's more operable with two hands. Maybe during situational uses the one handed mode is fine. Anyway, despite this argument the physical keyboard I find is much more accurate and comfortable than touch typing. Chris Oh "LCD" flash??? David Ruddock The screen flashes white.

Mayoo http://whatyearisit.info/img/what_year_is_it.jpg ecnjnr 2017 :) Miku is Best Vocaloid There's something called "locking" you may have heard of it :^) Cinj Still don't understand why BB dumped their own OS in favor of Android, especially since BB10 was capable of running Android apps. That's like buying a Mac just to format the drive and put Windows on it, what's the point? I bought my mom a Blackberry Classic and it's a great little phone especially for more tech challenged people who don't need or want all the bells and whistles that come with the two major players. If BB is going to shift to just making mediocre Android phones, they may as well close up shop already. Francois Nguyen Some reasons I guess (based on my own experience with BBOS 10): - Software AND hardware issues on double-tapping on the hardware keyboard - lack of apps - lack of support from major players (facebook, BB itself) Cinj My response to each point: - No opinion since I haven't encountered this - 99% of apps are garbage so no big deal - You can't as easily help clog the internet with pics of the unimpressive food you just ate, unfunny memes, and "like, share, and type amen or you're going to hell" spam? How will humanity survive??? - Quite the opposite. BB is way less obtuse in it's interface than the constantly changing Android one. Android and it's apps are like a hieroglyphic tile puzzle that keeps getting shuffled with every update. Try teaching a tech illiterate parent how to operate Android, I dare you. - Neither of those really have a distinct advantage over the other. But it's nice to have options all the same. - See previous opinion on apps Not trying to slam you or anything, just giving my take. I think we need more options in the marketplace, not less. That's really my main gripe. But I know that's a fantasy because people generally gravitate towards a duality, so for now we're stuck with iOS and Android until some paradigm shift occurs. Francois Nguyen My responses to your responses lol: - it's not a widespread issue; it's not surprising a lot of people didn't know about it - that 1 % of good and varied apps is what everyone I know (tech illiterate or not) makes the switch to iOS or Android so I wouldn't ignore that - I agree with you on your statement. Most consumers disagree on this, though... My friends ABSOLUTELY need to tell the world what they eat for supper and what they read when they're in the bathroom, for example. - Most people that tried my BB Q10 or any Z10 in kiosk ABSOLUTELY disagree with your statement. They're all biased towards iOS or Android, I know (me too, BTW). But that's how sad the situation is when BB got too late to the consumer market. There's no incentive to switch OS. About teaching Android to a tech illiterate, I always did that to several 65+ years people in my neighborhood who never touched a PC in their daily life because it's too complicated for them. In short, BB OS = complicated, Android = easy, iOS = too easy. YMMV. - That's not a big issue now for developers. It's gonna be an issue when most apps (garbage or not) require Kitkat or later. Lack of incentive for devs = lack of enthusiasm for the platform. Winston Compatibility =/= native support. android apps run TERRIBLY on BB10 Cinj To be fair, most Android apps run terribly on Android too. And you're really not missing anything if you're unable to run most of the schlock that infests the play store anyway. Metallinatus Android apps have Google Play Services on Android, which is essential for a hell load of apps to work.... DEVVVV Chen ruined BlackBerry HumbleButBlunt Looks like the stock market disagrees with you. Nate650 The answer is simple: it didn't sell well and the lack of an ecosystem. Being able to run Android apps is not the same as having access to Google Play. ecnjnr I hope Blackberry resolves the performance issues by launch, or I'm reconsidering my purchase. Thanks for the review Jordan Palmer You and me both. ToniCipriani ‚úìp«ù·¥â…ü·¥â…π«ù å I'm just curious if you guys ever got updates. Some other reviewers stated they got at least 3 updates after receiving the review unit. Jordan Palmer I received a single update after this review went live. So far, it has only fixed some of my cell connectivity issues. Nothing else. Suicide_Note Even if they do that, it's still a mediocre phone. ecnjnr I'm a fan of physical keyboards. This phone is a Moto Z Play with a slightly bigger battery, a newer version of Android, a better camera and a physical keyboard. That's worth $100 to me, but maybe not for you. freshprince_87 Moto Z Play has a bigger battery Nate650 Bigger by a whopping 5 mAh. Miku is Best Vocaloid You can wait for the Moto Mod that will have a physical keyboard. ToniCipriani ‚úìp«ù·¥â…ü·¥â…π«ù å If they do a portrait version that is. Martin Rios Dude it depends on the market... Yeah say that "virtual keyboards are better than physical keyboards, swipe, etc.) but there are some folks that are waiting for the rise (or maybe it's the hype) for these kind of devices. Also another point is this sentence >>> "people who use their phones more for communication rather than media consumption, people who are tired of having the same one as everyone else, people who are professionals and rely on their phone to get things done, and people who are looking for something durable that will last through a busy day" >>> I'M ONE OF THEM. I can give less than a f*ck about aesthetics, ceramic look and all that crap, what I want is to be able to comfortably reply my company emails, open docs, scan paperwork, take crisp photos on the field and not sweating the cold if the phone ever slips from my hand (which I doubt). Sure phone must pass through IT Dept to block lost of sh!t like social media but I have my personal phone for that. I'm hoping a OEM in the near future release a phone with nowadays hardware and inspired by a Nokia E7-00, by the way that's my company device (I rejected a trashy Samsung Grand Prime the company tried to make me use, instead I went to Ebay and got a cheap yet efficient Nokia with a horizontal keyboard, Symbian, a decent camera and EAS capabilities). Nate650 Yea, it's a big issue. I still experience performance issues on my Priv. The Priv would be such an amazing device if they address those issues, but it's already been over a year old and they haven't. Do employees even use their own phones? They have to know about these issues by now. Kawshik Ahmed Does the stock 'Blackberry Launcher' supports Android 7.1's 'Launcher Shortcuts' or you have to use a 3rd party launcher ?? Muzaffar I don't understand that BB named it KEYone instead of Mercury. Venice also looks promising at first but becomes flop latter. Nate650 The name is the least of their problems. The performance issues and price are more important. Muzaffar That's why it becomes a flop. paul4tA I skimmed most of the review and went straight to the performance, because if they haven't fixed that from the PRIV, nothing else matters. I love my physical keyboard and have actually come to appreciate some of the other features over time, but I don't think I can take another year of the terrible performance, waiting sometimes minutes for the software to catch up with me. Nate650 It's interesting that not all the reviews mentioned poor performance. That leads me to believe there is a particular culprit and that it's fixable. Jordan L 2 things: I need this on Verizon for one of my bosses, and where can I buy it? Jordan Palmer Updated the buy link. It's up in the specs. BB will be releasing a CDMA version sometime near the end of the month, I think. John Just hold off for 10 years or so until Blackberry's keyboard patents expire and we'll see it put to use by more competent manufacturers. HumbleButBlunt BB doesn't manufacture devices anymore. Cuvis They still hold the patents, and license them to TCL. ToniCipriani ‚úìp«ù·¥â…ü·¥â…π«ù å Probably earlier, when someone somewhere somehow leaks it China and other knockoff makers start building them. RickMLA Battery pull. Fixes everything. Francois Nguyen Battery is non-removable on the KEYone... ToniCipriani ‚úìp«ù·¥â…ü·¥â…π«ù å Hold the power button for 32 seconds = Battery Pull Reset. JL It¬¥s incredibly horrible! Dragos Lucian So Blackberry is starting to be like an ass itch, and I bet the majority doesn't like that feel. And while we're at it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rla7wt8wKGM djinn123 Just because you don't like PKB's it doesn't mean they aren't for someone else. I'm tired of hearing "who uses PKBs these days" or to that effect. If you can't understand why some people NEED it, then maybe you can just stfu? Stefan Seidel Is the keyboard touch sensitive like on the Priv? That's by far the most favourite feature on my Priv, and I'm sad everytime it doesn't work in an app. Also, as to add something useful to the physical versus virtual keyboard discussion: - multi-lingual virtual keyboards have only come up recently. I frequently write in different languages, and having to manually switch between them just doesn't work (especially when sometimes you insert a word from another language in the middle of a sentence) - I am a Sysadmin and every so often I do need to get in to some server from my phone. Doing that with a on-screen keyboard is nothing short of having a hot iron stamp on your forehead. Having the full screen AND quick and easy access to non-alphanumeric characters is such a huge plus that it would justify any price (if you need it for work/serious business). I agree that using Swype or Gboard with swiping is pretty darn good when it comes down to just blurting out some natural language. Anything beyond that is a pain. Hamilton Jimenez Vasquez I think physical keyboards are way better than touchscreen keyboards, but.... I wouldnt switch my large 5.7 and beautiful screen just to have a nicer keyboard, not in this world. Not sir. dabug91 So annoyed that this phone even exists. Blackberry needs to do the world a favor and permanently exit the smartphone business. They should have closed shop more than 6 years ago. Nate650 And how would that benefit you?

Android Pay v1.22 prepares Visual ID facial recognition based on Hands Free and reveals testing for Brazil, Trinidad & Tobago, and Canada [APK Teardown] Cody Toombs Follow View All Posts 2017/05/05 1:23pm PDTMay 5, 2017 37 Plus 1 on G+ 23 Share on Facebook 46 Share on Twitter Total Shares106 APK Teardown Applications Downloads News Article Contents 1 Teardown 1.1 New Currencies 1.2 Hands Free returns as Visual ID 1.3 Testing and error reporting tools 2 Download Android Pay may not have had a massive launch, or has it been as aggressively rolled out as Samsung Pay, but it is steadily setting up shop in more countries around the globe. If you don't happen to find yourself in one of the dozen countries that have either already seen a launch or at least have an official promise of one coming soon, you might be interested to know that Google has at least set its sights on a few other countries. Text in the latest update of the Android Pay app hints at four previously unannounced markets. There are also obvious signs Google is merging the recently closed Hands Free experiment into Android Pay and expanding it significantly. Teardown Disclaimer: Teardowns are based on evidence found inside of apks (Android's application package) and are necessarily speculative and usually based on incomplete information. It's possible that the guesses made here are totally and completely wrong. Even when predictions are correct, there is always a chance that plans could change or may be canceled entirely. Much like rumors, nothing is certain until it's officially announced and released. The features discussed below are probably not live yet, or may only be live for a small percentage of users. Unless stated otherwise, don't expect to see these features if you install the apk. New Currencies The evidence for this one comes in the form of a new list of currency codes. Most of them relate to countries where Android Pay is already active, or at least Google has already said it will be soon. However, four of them belong to countries that haven't been officially announced yet. The list of currencies includes: Brazilian Real Trinidad & Tobago Dollar Irish Pound Canadian Dollar Correction: Ireland was added in December 2016. I was using an incorrect source list that was missing the rollout to AIB, KBC, and Ulster Bank. Thanks,¬†Daniel Brierton and Ail√≠n √ì'S. Of course, a teardown already told us last year that Canada is on the list, but Google hasn't actually taken the plunge to publicly commit. The other three are new. Rumors have circulated about all of them, particularly Brazil, which has been more officially mentioned by companies involved with the rollout of NFC-based payment terminals. Nevertheless, there haven't been any official statements about expansion into these countries by Google. Currency Codes <string-array name="currency_code"> <item>Please make a selection</item> <item>USD</item> <item>GBP</item> <item>SGD</item> <item>AUD</item> <item>HKD</item> <item>BRL</item>¬† // Brazilian Real <item>TTD</item>¬† // Trinidad & Tobago Dollar <item>PLN</item> <item>IEP</item>¬† // Irish pound <item>CAD</item>¬† // Canadian Dollar <item>JPY</item> <item>NZD</item> <item>OTHER</item> </string-array> This list doesn't appear to actually serve a purpose for regular users. Rather, it appears to be a tool for testers that need to switch currencies while working with payment terminals. As such, I'm not so sure the list won't be removed in the future, but at least it gives us some insight into what's coming. Unfortunately, it also doesn't tell us when to expect a launch in these new locales. Naturally, we'll keep an eye out for new information as it becomes available. A quick note about currencies: I copied Google's names for the currency codes directly. It's possible the Android Pay developers don't actually mean for IEP to be the Irish Pound, but may be using it as a symbolic reference to the Euro when it's used in Ireland. That would make sense if there are different rules or tax laws at processing time. Hands Free returns as Visual ID Many people probably didn't pay much attention to the Hands Free trial Google launched in and around its home base last year. To summarize, it's basically a new way to complete an in-person transaction without using a phone or card. Actually, you still need your phone with you because it relies on the various technologies that make up location services (i.e. Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS); but Instead of tapping it to a payment terminal, customers say "I'll pay with Google" and give their initials to the cashier, then their identity is confirmed using a camera and Google's facial recognition technology. A couple of months ago, the pilot program for Hands Free was shuttered, but Google left it with a somewhat promising message that hinted it wasn't really dead. Now it's clear why the message was so upbeat: Google is rolling Hands Free into Android Pay. It appears the feature will be branded Visual ID. code <string name="handsfree_landing_text1">It‚Äôs as simple as snapping a picture</string> <string name="handsfree_landing_text2">A camera will recognize you at the register</string> <string name="handsfree_landing_text3">Your points will be applied automatically</string> <string name="handsfree_landing_title">Never miss out on points again</string> <string name="handsfree_landing_title1">One-time setup</string> <string name="handsfree_landing_title2">Works like magic</string> <string name="handsfree_landing_title3">Just pay &amp; go</string> <string name="handsfree_learn_more">Learn more about Visual ID</string> <string name="handsfree_setting_title">Visual ID</string> <string name="handsfree_skip_button_title">Skip</string> <string name="handsfree_turn_on_button">Turn on</string> <string name="handsfree_welcome_button">See how it works</string> <string name="handsfree_photo_setup_title">Snap a picture of yourself</string> <string name="handsfree_photo_setup_subtitle">This will help Android Pay recognize you at the register</string> <string name="handsfree_permissions_title">Visual ID uses location &amp; Bluetooth</string> <string name="handsfree_permissions_text">Make sure you have both turned on so that Android Pay can recognize you at the register</string> <string name="handsfree_photo_error_subtitle">Make sure the photo clearly shows your face with no one else in the frame</string> <string name="handsfree_photo_error_title">Let‚Äôs try that again</string> Google promises to keep privacy intact by never sharing your picture with the merchant and deleting any images taken by its cameras within the store. Obviously, that doesn't impact the store's own cameras. <string name="handsfree_consent_text_identity_text">Google creates and stores a face template based on the photo you save during setup. When you're at a participating store, Visual ID will automatically confirm your identity using facial recognition technology (your face template is compared to the image captured by the in-store Visual ID camera).

They‚Äôre not stored or saved.</string> Also worth noting is that this doesn't prevent customers from enjoying their loyalty cards. Google will also match stored membership cards with the merchant and automatically apply them when your identity is confirmed. code <string name="handsfree_consent_subtitle">Visual ID is a secure way to confirm your identity at participating stores, making it easier to do things like earn loyalty points and redeem rewards.</string> <string name="handsfree_loyalty_card_message">Visual ID is on and your loyalty points will be automatically applied at checkout</string> <string name="handsfree_setting_description">At participating stores, Android Pay will recognize you at the register and automatically apply your loyalty points</string> <string name="handsfree_loyalty_card_error_message">Your photo has not uploaded.

You can turn Visual ID off at any time by changing your Android Pay settings.</string> Visual ID will require a camera mounted at checkout locations in stores, which means it's probably not going to become a widespread feature anytime soon. However, if it can garner lower transaction fees from banks or offer unique benefits for stores where customers actually need truly hands-free purchasing ‚Äì picture Starbucks and other places where people often carry things in and out without having time to organize ‚Äì it may catch on in a few places pretty quickly. Testing and error reporting tools While it's not at all important to us as users, there were some other bits included with this release for use by testers. When issues arise during use, they can report the nature of the test and what issues came up. The "engagement type" lists the type of tests, including: Ninja Field Testing (I love this name), Smoke Testing, Country Launch Testing, and Other. I don't have much to say about the rest of it, but for those that are curious, take a look at the rest of the reporting options. code <string-array name="engagement_type"> <item>Please make a selection</item> <item>Ninja Field Testing</item> <item>Smoke Testing</item> <item>Country Launch Testing</item> <item>Other</item> </string-array> <string-array name="hiccup_type"> <item>Please make a selection</item> <item>Unexpected keyguard</item> <item>Repeated keyguard</item> <item>Multiple taps required</item> <item>No hiccups</item> <item>Other</item> </string-array> <string-array name="terminal_message"> <item>Please make a selection</item> <item>Approved</item> <item>Decline</item> <item>Insert card</item> <item>Present one card</item> <item>Card type not accepted</item> <item>Terminal froze/crashed</item> <item>Terminal restarted</item> <item>Other</item> </string-array> <string-array name="terminal_type"> <item>Please make a selection</item> <item>Veriphone vx 820</item> <item>Veriphone vx 520</item> <item>Other</item> </string-array> <string-array name="user_perceived_result"> <item>Please make a selection</item> <item>Success no problems</item> <item>Success with hiccups</item> <item>Failure</item> </string-array> Download The APK is signed by Google and upgrades your existing app. The cryptographic signature guarantees that the file is safe to install and was not tampered with in any way.

Just like Samsung Pay, not every client can use it. Me included :( Mayoo something something Cana... OH WAIT ... https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jFPBQaPL5mQ/hqdefault.jpg D√°ire Mooney The Irish Pound? Here in Ireland we've used the Euro since 2002, why would they add support for a dead currency? And we've already got android pay anyway... Cody Toombs I searched Google for the currency code and copied what they had listed for IEP. Perhaps the Android Pay developers don't actually mean for it to be the Irish Pound, but just using it ass a symbolic reference to the Euro when it's used in Ireland. That would make sense if there are different rules or tax laws at processing time. Daniel Brierton Also, Android Pay is already available in Ireland with AIB and KBC. Ail√≠n √ì‚ÄôS And Ulster Bank too since the other day. Cody Toombs Thanks for the heads up to both you and @Popple3:disqus. I've updated the article to clarify that Ireland isn't new. Ail√≠n √ì‚ÄôS No worries Cody. I'm still truly confused about the references to Irish Punt though üòÇüòÖ ozone89 Meanwhile, I'm tied to BOI üò© Ail√≠n √ì‚ÄôS They'll launch with Samsung Pay in a month or so. I'm sure of it üòÇ Ail√≠n √ì‚ÄôS The reference to "Irish Pound" is bizarre. That currency which we called Punt (Irish for Pound) hasn't been in use since the early 2000s when we switched to ‚Ç¨, and anyway, we have had Android Pay since December 2016. Bizarre.

DavidW username checks out Matt If you steal their credit card and google account information....no. Assuming the person wouldn't ring you up if you were wearing a mask. Matt It seems like installing facial recognition cameras in stores is a lot more difficult than a screen that just shows them a picture of me. It's not like they don't know what I look like - they're looking right at me. mike shwilly News articles say that Android Pay will be launched in Russia on 16th May Cody Toombs Yeah, Russia and South Korea have been confirmed either by Google, partners, or other companies involved in the rollout. They're definitely happening this year, but the dates have always been a little sloppy. I think we'll see at least a half dozen other countries by the end of the year, and maybe more. The adoption rate has been picking up. newtonfb Still waiting for Paypal to be activated.... HUEHUE BR OMG BRAZIIIIIIIL Renan Oh my god, I think I've wet my pants when I saw Brazil getting Android Pay love. God please yes! Ail√≠n √ì‚ÄôS Are NFC/Contactless terminals and Contactless debit/credit cards common in Brazil? Renan Not at all :P At least not where I live... but, to be honest, I've never asked, because I can't use even Samsung Pay (which seems to be supported here) because my old S5 doesn't seems to support it (and I'm using Lineage OS, anyway). But having support will increase interest, which will make more and more terminals to support NFC/contactless and will make contactless cards more common (or at least I hope so) Ail√≠n √ì‚ÄôS Ah, that's good Samsung Pay is there, hopefully that is encouraging Contactless take up. I suppose maybe Brazil relies a lot on the old card swipe technology and hence Samsung Pay would be of great use? When you go to pay with card don't you ever see the Contactless symbol there? I know nothing about the Brazilian payments market hence my curiosity üòÇ Thalles Ferreira Look, don't know where Renan lives in Brazil, not telling he's wrong, we're the size of a continent... But in S√£o Paulo and Rio, contactless terminals are now very common, many of them with stickers of Samsung Pay or NFC symbol. About the bank technology, it's bizarre, but Brazil uses by a decade or more the chip technology that US struggles to implement now. Here it's one of the most technical‚Äãadvanced in financial market of the world (sorry about this sentence, my English ain't that good). But paying with cell phone is awkward for most people here... It looks like a Jetsons future lol. But there are banks taking the next step, removing physical use of banks (only auto terminals) or changing the old numeric password for biometrics, not only in the app but in the terminals too. If you have other questions, I'm glad to explain, as I love the theme lol Fernando Pena Actually, they are pretty common. Most credit card terminals in Brasil are NFC supported these days (those from CIELO, REDE etc), they usually have a symbol near the screen that indicates it's supported. But many people don't know that... I have friends that use NFC payments all the time, from banks like "Banco do Brasil". Fernando Pena I really hope Nubank is related to this Android Pay initiative in Brasil. They are promising this for quite some time (maybe a year by now) and I use their card A LOT. Fingers crossed. 4Ui812 Off topic but , Trini women are hot. Disqusman Trinidad and Tobago?!!

See Offers Nation & World Posted Yesterday at 11:21 PM Updated May 5 increase font size Hear, hear: Voice-activated gadgets may not speak well for security Those gizmos can be more than just annoying; they can put you at risk. By MAE ANDERSONAssociated Press Share Comment Read Article NEW YORK ‚Äî Burger King pulled a pretty juicy marketing stunt last month that drew plenty of attention ‚Äì not just to the Whopper, but also to the intrinsic vulnerabilities of a new type of voice-activated gadget. The fast food chain‚Äôs 15-second television ad targeted Google Home, a speaker that can answer questions and control other smart appliances. When an actor in the ad said ‚ÄúOK, Google‚Äù and asked a question about the Whopper, Google Home obediently began reading the burger‚Äôs ingredients in homes around the country ‚Äì effectively extending the commercial for however long it took someone to shout ‚ÄúOK, Google, stop!‚Äù Having only debuted in 2015, Amazon's Echo Dot is still experiencing growing pains even as it grows in popularity. But the next generation of voice assistants may come with better security, including individual voice recognition and even image recognition. Associated Press/Jeff Chiu Search photos available for purchase: Photo Store ‚Üí Google and Wikipedia quickly made fixes to shut it down. Though annoying, the stunt may have done some good by highlighting how easy it is to hijack such devices. (Just imagine a burglar spying a voice assistant and asking it to unlock doors.) It could also speed the development of home voice assistants with better security. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a wakeup call,‚Äù said Earl Perkins, a digital security analyst at the research firm Gartner. TRIGGER WARNING Voice assistants such as Google Home, Apple‚Äôs Siri and Amazon‚Äôs Echo devices have always been susceptible to accidental hijack. A Google ad during the Super Bowl that used the phrase ‚ÄúOK, Google‚Äù reportedly set off people‚Äôs devices. And in a January story that turned a family into media celebrities, a woman‚Äôs 6-year-old daughter ordered a dollhouse and sugar cookies simply by asking Amazon‚Äôs voice assistant Alexa for them. Since the devices are so new ‚Äì the Amazon Echo debuted in 2015, Google Home last year ‚Äì they‚Äôre still having growing pains. And they‚Äôre growing in popularity; Consumer Intelligence Research Partners estimates that Amazon sold 3 million Echo devices in the U.S. in the fourth quarter of 2016, bringing the total to more than 8 million. Amazon doesn‚Äôt release sales figures. Many experts believe that deliberate attempts to trigger voice assistants will be short-lived. Among other things, brands have to face the consequences of potentially annoying millions of people. ‚ÄúBurger King was doing what the Burger King brand is known to do, stir controversy and make sure it gets lots of coverage,‚Äù Forrester analyst James McQuivey said. ‚ÄúVery few brands want to do that.‚Äù Of course, spammers can still try to implement the technique. But voice assistants already have a few ways to block them. THREATS AND COUNTERMEASURES Amazon already makes sure its TV commercials and those of its partners can‚Äôt inadvertently trigger the speaker. Developers that provide Echo with ‚Äúskills‚Äù that let it, for instance, order pizza, are also prohibited from creating Alexa commands that would trigger ads. Google says it also has techniques to block TV ads from activating Google Home. Voice assistants are still in their ‚Äúvery early days,‚Äù Google says; the company plans to ‚Äúmonitor and learn as we go.‚Äù Hackers might also be a threat. But because voice assistants are so new and limited in scope, more established connected devices such as webcams, routers and printers pose more of a threat for now. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not that we won‚Äôt see some creative or unique instance (of hacking), but I don‚Äôt think this is going to be the next great wave of cybercrime,‚Äù said Steve Grobman, chief technology officer at the security company McAfee. MORE SECURITY TO COME The devices are going to need better security. ‚ÄúWhen you move into a world of voice, some of the rules that we‚Äôre accustomed to, related to security for computers, change,‚Äù Gartner‚Äôs Perkins said. Exactly how that works could depend on exactly what task a voice assistant is performing. Asking about the weather requires less security than accessing a bank account. Amazon already has options for setting up security codes to shop, make financial transactions or unlock and start cars. Of course, someone could always overhear you reciting a security phrase. A better solution, and one that companies are hard at work on, would be to identify a person‚Äôs voice, much the way Google and Facebook identify faces today. Apple already lets users voice-train its Siri digital assistant so it‚Äôs more likely to activate only when it hears a specific voice. Amazon has a voice training option for Alexa. Google Home can recognize up to six voices, though it won‚Äôt prevent unauthorized users from activating the assistant. Experts suggest that companies will eventually add cameras to voice assistants. Amazon‚Äôs new Echo Look has a camera, but it‚Äôs for offering fashion advice. Combining a facial scan with voice recognition would definitely beef up security, although they‚Äôll also create new privacy concerns. ‚ÄúWithout any security or minimal security, (voice assistants are) going to be a fat target,‚Äù Perkins said. ‚ÄúThere will be all kinds of innovation associated with compromising these systems.‚Äù Share Read or Post Comments Were you interviewed for this story?

Fourteen people were killed in the December 2015 attacks by twisted husband-wife Islamist extremists Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik. ‚ÄúWithout defendants Twitter, Facebook and Google (YouTube), the explosive growth of IS over the last few years into the most feared terrorist group in the world would not have been possible,‚Äù the suit, filed Wednesday in Los Angeles, alleges. ‚ÄúFor years, Defendants have knowingly and recklessly provided the terrorist group IS with accounts to use its social networks as a tool for spreading extremist propaganda, raising funds, and attracting new recruits,‚Äù reads the complaint, filed by lawyers Keith Altman and Theida Salazar.

MediaRadar, a company that tracks advertising across the web for thousands of publishers, reported that YouTube suffered a decline in the number of Google Preferred customers in the US and Canada for the first time this year. Google Preferred is a program where advertisers can match themselves to highly trafficked videos of certain themes such as music or news. The ad-tracking firm noted that four major advertisers ‚Äî Starbucks, Dish, Pepsi and AT&T ‚Äî yanked their ads from YouTube. A few others, including General Motors, Verizon and Johnson & Johnson, continued stuck with YouTube despite the uproar. ‚ÄúSome of the exact brands that said they would stop actually did in April,‚Äù said MediaRadar CEO Todd Krizelman. ‚ÄúThis suggests that at least some of the contraction is related to the negative press in late March.‚Äù YouTube is said to be a $12 billion business, a wildly popular video-sharing platform that is growing faster than its parent Google, the leader in global-search advertising. SEE ALSO Ad firm pulls spots from YouTube over proximity to white supremacist videos 0:0 Madison Avenue is finally putting the screws to ad-selling tech... Mizuho Securities analyst Neil Doshi calculated in March report that if advertiser defections cut into YouTube revenue by 10 percent, then Google‚Äôs parent company Alphabet‚Äôs earnings would shrink by 15 cents a share, or slightly less than 1 percent. The Times of London opened a hornet‚Äôs nest for Google after reporting in March that advertisers such as Walmart and JPMorgan were inadvertently showing up next to hate speech ‚Äî a problem that is vigorously policed by marketers in traditional media. Google says it has changed its algorithms and is stopping anyone promoting hate speech from receiving ad dollars from its Adsense program. Adsense is a way for publishers to receive ad revenue when they hit certain traffic goals. But Matan Uziel ‚Äî who runs a YouTube channel called Real Women, Real Stories, featuring women speaking out about unseen hardships ‚Äî says Google‚Äôs technology isn‚Äôt sophisticated enough. He sent The Post a host of disgusting videos that he says YouTube has done nothing to remove. Uziel has worked with ad exec Madonna Badger, who champions positive portrayals of women in marketing. SEE ALSO Google wakes up to its White Power problem 0:0 Google boss Larry Page is beginning to sweat. The search... ‚Äú[They] don‚Äôt know the difference between videos that are fighting the issues and videos that are from actual people who celebrate gender-based violence,‚Äù he told The Post. Uziel, based in Israel, says there are many examples of violence against children still hosted by YouTube. Last week, Google reported ad revenue of $17.4 billion in its latest quarter, up 71 percent versus the year-ago quarter. The most recent quarter didn‚Äôt include April. Speaking at the YouTube Brandcast event for advertisers on Thursday, YouTube boss Susan Wojcicki said, ‚ÄúWe apologize for letting some of you down. We can, and we will, do better.‚Äù Together Google and Facebook are predicted to bring in $106 billion ‚Äî half the world‚Äôs digital ad spending ‚Äî in 2017. Google alone is projected to take in $72.69 billion, according to eMarketer.

By Corazon Victorino On 05/05/17 AT 10:12 PM Close Apple‚Äôs Phil Schiller just shared his honest thoughts about the Amazon Echo and Google Home smart speakers. He also indirectly pointed out what he thinks is lacking in these¬†devices.¬† Gadgets 360 has finally published its interview with Apple‚Äôs Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing when he was in Bengaluru, India last March. When Schiller was asked to comment on the famous smart speakers Amazon Echo and Google Home, he responded that he won‚Äôt give specific comments on each device. He then candidly added, ‚ÄúMy mother used to have a saying that if you don‚Äôt have something nice to say, say nothing at all.‚Äù Schiller continued by saying that he‚Äôll just tackle the general concepts. He first pointed out that there is definitely a market for voice-driven assistants that‚Äôs why Apple is working so hard in developing and improving Siri. However, he noted that a voice assistant device without a screen is only important at times when it‚Äôs convenient to have this type of device. He set two examples to back his statement. First, he said that a device without a screen is perfect for when one is driving. Next, he stated that this technology is also useful¬†for when one is listening to music from a device across the room because there‚Äôs the advantage of switching songs without walking over and back to the device. READ: Amazon Prime Video coming to Apple TV this year Schiller stated that there are many other times when a voice assistant device is beneficial, but he thinks that this does not mean such devices should not come with a screen display. For this, he used asking for directions as an example. The Apple executive said that while a voice assistant can say the directions out loud, it would still be better if one can see the directions on a map. ‚ÄúI can see what turns are coming up, and I can see where there is congestion, I understand better my route and what I‚Äôm going to do,‚Äù he said.¬† According to Schiller, another aspect where the voice-only assistants fail is photography. Voice assistants could never work with this application because photography requires a screen nowadays. He linked this downside to social media saying, ‚ÄúAll the social networking apps‚Ä¶ are now embracing photos more and more.‚Äù He also said, ‚ÄúThe idea of a device without a screen, well it‚Äôs not really useful for that whole category of photos that we all share.‚Äù Lastly, Schiller tackled the disadvantage of voice-only devices when it comes to gaming. ‚ÄúThe biggest category of all of apps is games, and I have yet to see any voice-only games that, for me, are nearly as fun as the one that I play on my screen,‚Äù he said. Because of this, he firmly believes that the role of the screen is very important in the tech industry, and it will remain that way.¬† READ: Apple Pay updated with 21 more U.S. banks While Schiller‚Äôs comments are vague, AppleInsider reports that they could be providing insight as to what Apple is planning for its voice assistant technology long-term. At present, the Cupertino giant is rumored to be working on a Siri-based smart speaker that would surely be a direct competitor to the Amazon Echo and Google Home. Details about the device are scarce, but it‚Äôs not that hard to imagine that it would feature a display given Schiller‚Äôs sentiments.¬† Phil Schiller gave his honest thoughts on the Amazon Echo and Google Home smart speakers.

Google may be sued over Nexus 6P early shutdown and bootloop issues Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/04/14 11:09am PDTApr 14, 2017 134 Plus 1 on G+ 316 Share on Facebook 84 Share on Twitter Total Shares534 Android OS Legal Marshmallow 6.0 News Nexus 6P The Android hardware space is fast beginning to look like a watered down episode of Suits. Following on from news¬†earlier in the week that LG is facing a¬†bootloop¬†lawsuit regarding several of its phones, Huawei's Nexus 6P could be responsible for Google encountering a similar inconvenience. As well as being accused of the same bootloop problem that has blighted LG devices, there are reports from consumers that the Nexus 6P has a premature battery shutdown problem. We reported late last year that certain Huawei Nexus 6Ps were suffering from the¬†early shutdown problem, causing them to die with as much as 60% battery still indicated. Now, law firm¬†Chimicles & Tikellis LLP is investigating the possibility¬†of bringing a class action lawsuit against Google on behalf of customers who have faced this issue. Also included in¬†any potential suit would be the same bootloop issue that has also affected owners of the LG Nexus 5X. The problems have mostly been reported by users running Android 7.0 Nougat, but there are also claims that backpedalling to Marshmallow 6.0 on the same devices doesn't fix anything. Neither Google nor Huawei seems to be taking either responsibility or action to resolve issues such as these. While Google is aware of the problems, having assigned both the shutdown¬†and bootloop issues in its tracker, its official position is that those affected by the issue should reach out to customer support for a replacement device. But customers going directly to Huawei about the fault are also out of luck, as they are being told that the problem is with the software and not the hardware, and thus not an issue covered by the manufacturer's warranty - whether it's still in date or not. This is a very frustrating situation for the consumer when neither company seems willing to investigate properly or hold their hands up. Let us know in the comments if any of you Nexus 6P owners have experienced either issue. We'll report back with any further developments as they come in.

Thankfully our Ombudsman financially bullies the carrier until we get a resolution in Australia. Got a free refurb replacement, hopefully won't suffer the same. Matthew Hanson Mine seems to love to die around 10%. As a few others have stated, the low power notification will appear, I will use it for a few minutes and then it powers off. The battery history shows this steep cliff falloff after beginning the recharging and power on. Melad360 i always saw my 6p shut off as soon as the power saving mode came on at 15% battery. this started to happen after an update, i think 7.0 or 7.1, never happened before that though Latheryin This really is a software issue with what they ship out to nexus devices. It also effects the nexus 6 from Motorola. Seems every nexus device that got 7.x has this issue. Packer Backer Nope, doesn't affect the Nexus 6. Provide some links or just don't comment. Latheryin Sorry not a baby sitter. Why not do some research before you post. Also might want to look at the source code and try to understand what you are talking about before posting. abrasive I myself did start to see this issue after about a year, but the device was easily replaced for another warranty-related issue. I would assume my clock was started over again. Not that I haven't seen the same problem on computers with old batteries, but I would hope to get substantially more mileage out of a battery. Nexus 6p Issues Its about time! There are so many issues with the Google branded phones, it doesn't make any sense. We have already reached out to the firm to provide any support they need in accomplishing their potential goal of this class action lawsuit. Its time someone sticks up for the consumers who have been ripped off by this multi-billion dollar company. In the mean time, please follow us on Twitter and sign our petition at Change.org regarding this very issue. We have a lot of signatures and would appreciate your's and your share as well. Thank you in advance! 3fren I'm seeing so many comments about the battery issue going away with just replacing it. I guess I have to give it try. I'm always cautious when it comes to replacing a OEM battery with a replica though. Doug The early shutdown has been an issue on my Nexus 6P ever since I upgraded to Android 7. This has been a frustrating experience - I cannot trust the phone to not die on me when I need it and find myself constant carrying an external battery pack so I can start my phone back up if it dies. P. Sherman Just get an iPhone. It has SIGNIFICANTLY LESS DEVASTATING defects and actually functional software Quality Control team. thereasoner Lol, iOS is the worst when it comes to software issues and iPhone hardware is junk. No Google devices have yet to suffer the nightmares that were error 53 and Touch Disease much less the related class action lawsuits against Apple because of them! Are you trying to be funny? P. Sherman Yeah, no Android devices have had to deal with Touch Disease or error 53. Instead, they spontaneously combust (Note 7,) bootloop for no reason at all (ALL LG'S,) have glass backs that pop out when exposed to a little heat (Xperia Z2 and Z3,) have nearly unusable Bluetooth connectivity (Pixel, Xperia Z5,) heat so badly you can cook an egg on it (every Android that had a massive update,)... I could go on! I'm simply stating that iOS has historically been significantly less buggy and disastrous than Android when a new update rolls around (Think the disaster that was KitKat to Lollipop. The transition from iOS 6 to 7 was SIGNIFICANTLY less dramatic than that in terms of bugs and drains.) Also, Have an open mind and stop automagically trashing the iPhone. The iPhone may be lacking significantly in some areas, but it has two significant advantages - USABILITY AND LONGEVITY. thereasoner Correct, any serious issues facing Android phones have been a one off affecting only one model out of dozens of different models/manufacturers while both device bricking issues found in recent iPhones in error 53 and touch disease affected a much smaller base of phones and just one manufacturer . All the other minor issues you mentioned, be they real or exaggerated, are also very similar to minor issues various iPhones have faced as well its just that it's even worse for iPhones because there are so few models from one manufacturer(and they're still worse) vs several dozens models from over a dozen different manufacturers. That's how bad iPhones are when they have more serious issues despite producing so few models. Issues with Android phone should dwarf those of iPhones by a huge margin considering how many models /manufacturers are involved but they don't, the iPhones still manage to be worse! It's mind boggling when you think about but that's how bad Apple quality is these days. Jon Puhl My 6P is absolutely absurd. It shuts down as high up as 51%, and almost always when the battery percentage is lower than 30%. I'm really upset about this, because it's Google's last Nexus flagship, and it can't even last a full two years without having this dumb battery problem. Daniel Orchard I got a full refund for my 6p, and bought a pixel xl, was out of pocket a little for the upgrade but device was just out of warranty so im still happy with the outcome. Props to Google store support. Yeah i still l got charged the pixel while waiting for the refund, took about 2 weeks to come through but they organised the return shipping etc just like an rma. Im actually really happy. Mine would shutdown between 15-30% and i only lived with that for 2 weeks before starting the process of fixing it. Yes it happened after moving to 7.0 and yes rolling back to 6.x did not fix it so im convinced its software, nfi why they havent rolled out a fix yet. I suggest doing the same because all replacement n6p are still vulnerable to the bug afaik. Morenicano Just wanna make sure I follow, You saying you had your 6P for more than a year and they authorized a refund? I ask because I just reached them for an exchange but if I can get a refund and upgrade to the Pixel, I'll do it. Morenicano Just a heads up, JUST I contacted Google through the support tab in the settings of my 6P and they warranty replaced both mine and my wife's 6P and we bought them through Project Fi in November 2015 with no extended warranty. They said it's a known issue and setup the replacement with no problem and it has next (business) day shipping for the new one and you send the old one back once you have the new one up and running. They do put a hold for the value of the phone on your card while they wait for the old one to come back but they don't charge you Cory Wilson Crybabies. Seriously, my phone developed the issue last week, contacted Google, now I'm rocking a brand new Nexus 6p. Luckily I happened to be on the last day of my warranty but I also got protect so even if I was out of warranty I wasn't paying another $500 again. Just call Google instead of your lawyers dumb asses Packer Backer Wow, a snowflake playing Internet tough guy. Brandon Andrews I had my Nexus 6P become bricked by the bootloop issue. I bought my phone through Best buy and was still well within my 1 year manufacturer warranty when the problem occurred. Unfortunately when I called Best buy customer service and asked how to take care of the situation they told me to send it to this company called Jeg & Sons to get the problem reviewed and a replacement. Needless to say there was like a month long ordeal of mix ups with this company before they finally sent my phone back and told me they don't deal with my phone. Finally I eventually figured out I needed to send my phone to Huawei and they replaced my phone no problem. Sarah Despars I've never had this issue with my 6p so far. Hopefully it doesn't start! k_nonymous I experience this exact same problem and it drives me nuts. Battery saver mode on my 6P is supposed to be activated at 15% battery. The phone shuts off before it ever gets to that point. Also, 95% battery life is equivalent to 1h 5m???? Packer Backer Well well, according to thereasoner he thinks it's your fault. gparmar76 This is 100% hardware related...If it was the OS, it would be a widespread issue across all Android 7 handsets...Huawei is using cheap batteries... People who like the phone should go buy a replacement from a company like Zero Lemon (if available)..Or just buy another stock battery. Kirkster My Nexus 6P is 11 months old, and so far the only anomaly I've had is that it spontaneously factory-reset while in my pants pocket about two weeks ago, which was annoying. I recovered from the cloud backup, which restored all my apps, settings, etc, and my photos were set to back up to Google photos. I lost my call log and SMS messages though, but luckily most of my messaging is via WhatsApp (which restored everything). Still, annoying. I now have a SMS+call log app installed in case it happens again. No battery problems *yet*, now I'm dreading the one-year mark, after reading all the comments. Chalet_Badger My 6P bootloops, i can get it to start normally when the battery is ~5% or so but it will freeze and start to bootloop about a minute or two after. Duane I've had no issue with my 6p. Sounds like an annoying issue from the comments here. Robert B I've been having this problem for a few months now...I carry external battery around all the time because you never know when it feels like it's going to shut off and not turn back on Packer Backer According to thereasoner, it's your fault. clarence jones My 6p did not have the random shutdown at a certain percent issue before. After the 7.1.2 update it would crash and restart when the camera app was opened. About two days after the update it started boot looping and nothing i have tried has gotten it to successfully boot again. Packer Backer Tell thereasoner because he thinks it's your fault. Spudos Woah I thought this was just me. My ending battery life varies wildly, sometimes dying at 15% and on bad days dying around 40-50%. I would replace the battery myself but the teardown process looks like it requires an electrical engineering degree. Packer Backer thereasoner thinks it's your fault. Maybe you should straighten him out. ƒê·ª©c Th√†nh Maybe Google deserves to be sued. Kyle Zess I am plagued by this issue. My phone shutdown after 5 minutes of non charging use. Packer Backer thereasoner thinks it's your fault. David Vogt Only time mine would shut down early at 30% or less is if I was out in freezing cold weather, phone just didn't like freezing weather, keep it warm and it's fine blueman24 Just admit it that your "quick charge" bs killed the battery early. Truth hurts huh My Nexus 6p 128 was barely a year old and it never recovered from the bootloop issue where it would keep restarting and not getting past the Google screen then restart over and over, losing precious pictures and videos of my children. My sister's Nexus 5 eventually broke from the bootloop issue 3 months later. We both had the $80 warranty but it seemed unfair having to pay for a replacement REFURBISHED Nexus 6p when the damage was caused by bad software. Sucked how although Nexus/Google/Huwei knew of ongoing repeated problems a 6 -9 months earlier, yet FAILED to try to resolve or prevent the recurring boot loop issue from infecting more phones. Finally, a lawsuit is in place. Damani Boyce After 7.1.1 update my Nexus 6p got bootloop an can't be fixed shame on them not even a reply from Google or Huawei. thereasoner Many on here are saying that they had no problem getting it fixed/replaced. Packer Backer Yeah, it's ALL his fault.... Posts like yours make some people dream of twisting your head off. thereasoner Why would you say it's his fault? Smoking one to many fatties?, Lol. Razed Mine currently dies at around 10%. I use it moderately and have had it since launch. Got Nexus Protect, but that seems worthless as all reports are that using that service will just get me an even worse battery. thereasoner My Pixel has been great, I'll have to ask a friend at work about his 6p to see if he's having issues. By the sounds of it only a small percentage of devices are affected. Packer Backer Nexus 6 by Motorola was a better direction. Gordon Mine would shut off at 25% consistently. I called Huawei and they actually replaced the battery for free. I had to pay for shipping 1 way, but the covered the rest. I got my phone December 2015, and it was just replaced this February. ThEGr33k Which country? Gordon Canada Trey Bradshaw I haven't encountered any bootlooping and my phone doesn't shut off unless my battery drops to about 2%. olivrstal happens to my 6p quite a bit as well :( hope it's gonna make it till the pixel 2 comes out :D mrjoeyloke My wife just got the bootloop of death on her 6p. I think that might be a whole different issue though. Kuldeep Choudhary This happens when a gaint company like google hires a Chinese company to manufacture it's top line product. I'm using my motorola nexus 6 for 2.5 years and still not a single problem im facing and decided to keep it for 1 more year. Omar Al Matar Had the problem, I was out of warranty, called them, no frustration or arguments, 5 minutes i had the email to get my new phone, and i sent them the one i had, i was even out of the country. Now I got it to last me another year, so idk about y'all Kristen Oliver This happened with me until I replaced the battery... At my own cost. Funnily enough that is not a software issue 12321 Please click the links below for details of my experience, which is echoed by thousands of other Nexus 6P owners.

Sue them! Merxury My Nexus 6p died, it stuck at bootloop every time when I turn on my phone. Sara Bales I've had the Huawei Nexus 6P since July of 2016, purchased new in the box. It started randomly shutting down within weeks, often multiple times a day. It was annoying and inconvenient, even shutting down once when I was on a 911 call reporting an intruder in the garage (talk about chaos. . . I had to wait for it to reboot and call again). My phone entered the "boot loop of death" the last week of March. The first 6 or so crashes, it rebooted just fine. But then it started getting hung up on the rainbow google animations, until finally it wouldn't even push past the Google screen. I was able to pull up the barcodes but other system reboots were useless. Since my phone is still under warranty, Huawei agreed to repair it but I had to wait 5 days for a label from UPS. It's been almost 3 weeks and I've heard nothing. They also didn't offer to send a loaner phone. At least mine was under warranty, I see on the forum that Google and Huawei have refused to help and neither want to accept responsibility. Ron Nguyen My 6p shutdown prematurely everyday but at different battery percentages. Mostly around 30%, but I have had 40, 50s and 60. Anunnaki A battery replacement fixes the early shutdown problem. Sriidhar sriidhar My 6p died couple of weeks ago and Google and Huawei must be sued for not taking the responsibility, I'm a student and I saved a lot of money to buy the phone but now they're like, it's not our concern as you're out of warranty! Konstigt2 Very good, they should have issued a recall and fixed them all. To not have your phone avail when you need it in case of emergency could be fatal. I have gotten my battery and screen replaced and that fixed it for me. arpit saxena My 6p shutdown few months back, after bootloop and hasn't been turned on since them. Both companies failed to address the situation and to fix the fault Huawei asks for 400$. I don't seem to find any kind of Justice in this area. David Berry All you poor nexus folks hot rolled. High price.shite processor thats had issues in every phone its been put in & sealed in battery copping quick charge for 12months through then the new usbc port then add that to the Chinese manufacturer &issues that causes with returns & you have a massive recipie for disaster. So is your nexus 6p still beter than an s7e or note5or7?Maybe the little fire issue puts it on a par with note 7 just but with that 810 inside it was always doomed from the start. No wonder they canned it for the now overpriced pixel. I think id rather a umi z plus for under half the price. So wheres the samsung haters now? I hate them too but they do make the best phones once you tweak this & that & set it up right. My note5 died after 18 months too. It did cop a real hammering as a wifi hotspot for a while there though. It used to get real hot with a few people connected at once & my bro never let it rest & would run it hot & flat every day. Sometimes 2x a day so it was to be expected. I got 2 note 7s for Sweet f%$ck all & a free s7e from samsung so ill forgive them a little & send back my note5 in the fire proof box & keep the other note 7 as a spare & as compensation for losing all my music &stuff on the note5& the fiasco of the n7recall. Sealed in batteries suck unless you replace your phone every 18months. Boy Ling Mine shuts down at 33% maybe 8 Times out of 10. I never updated to android 7. Mandeep Singh Pannu Mine normally dies off at 30%, then I connected it to charge, it comes back on at 30%.... Also I live up north in the UK, and at early in the morning, if I go out, and it's too cold it just dies randomly theadamsegal Very disappointed with Google. My Nexus 6P started shutting off at around 20% less than a year after I purchased it. The basically pulled an Apple with the release of the Pixel. After purchasing 3 Nexus phones in 4 years, I won't be buying a Google handset again. Ashwini Kumar Same issue here. Phone dies suddenly at 10-15% without any warnings. I love the phone but battery is pathetic. I barely get 10 hours on light usage. I hate apple but the 6s plus from work would be at 50% battery at the end of the day. First google deserted the nexus brand and then not honouring the issue. Disappointed! Sean Stone I'm currently replying from my just received RMA replacement for the boot loop issue. My warranty was technically up in November but the Google Tech Support hooked me up anyway. Better outcome than I was expecting. Thomas Boel Mine shut's down at round about 20%, but only when the screen is turned on! The warning comes and immediately it starts shutting down. Maggie Smith I don't get any warning. It just reboots at random. I wish I did get a warning. David Schleifstein Shuts down at 15% for me, closer to 30% for my wife's. I also noticed that a short time in colder temperatures can cause the battery to drop dead at 50% and up. Ger PG How is this affecting users? David McFee Same issue. Daily premature shutdown. So annoying. Jon Watts Get a grip people. It's just a phone. If it doesn't work just get a new one. I've had the 6P since its release in 2015. Yes I've had a few issues but nothing that didn't eventually get fixed. Dirge Yeah, all those thousands of people that suffer from this problem better just get a grip. So Google sold a defective product, so what? Go buy another one. Duh. "I'm not having any problems therefore these people need to get their shit together." *Rolls eye's* Drew Harden https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/fff14c9ec4b9b4966ae37554f13b373d9bfa270aa644c3e5ef01a5fca3723410.png Mine usually shuts down when the phone is pretty cold and then I turn the screen on and then it just dies. In the warmer weather it still dies with 15% every time though. If I start a Snapchat video below 20% it's instantly off. Dan Molina I haven't had a shut down at 60% but I get it at 25% pretty consistently. Bootloop is rare too; however, I do get random restarts usually while on a phone call. Danny Mestriner Good, maybe they will finally get off their lazy asses and treat us like actual customers. I also have the shutdown issue since Nougat. Philip Quach I've had the same issue even after factory reset. It's especially bad when the temperature outside is cold. I'm really disappointed with Huawei and Google about this. Art≈´ras Rimonis Having the same issue. It always shuts down at 15% or even more. Cara Buttitta sometimes mine dies at 20% sometimes at 60%. just today my 6p was at 90%, I took one picture without the flash and it shut down. very frustrating David Perez Yes, it's been an issue since nougat, from what I recall. Both Nexus 6p devices I have suffered from increased battery drain, and sudden shutdown anywhere from 15 to 25%. Google points to Huawei, Huawei points to Google. I downgraded one device back to marshmallow. Battery drain is still pronounced, but at least no shutdown. I get my warning at 15% and can run until the single digits. John Adams Will die between 20-35% every time, also randomly restarts at around 50%. This phone has been plagued with bugs since release... Jordan Hindley https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/0aef98131463828edbc4ecec53b90938738636b0a4ab26649126e2b51247d48d.png My device shuts down at lots of different battery percentages and won't reboot until i attach to a power source. It's a nightmare. MeanBeans I get that all the time as well even after I changed the battery Mike I Easy. Have Google make their own phones. Call them, oh, Pixel? I'm writing this on my lg5x with 7.1.2. Very happy with it, but will take 200 off coupon on the LG g6 against any and all future 5x claims. Seiga Is it safe to say I should utilize my Nexus protect? I too am suffering from this issue. CJ Nexus 6p start shutting down with 1 to 2 times a day, which increase to more than 10 times within 3 month..huwaei and Google blaming each other for issues..phone is under warranty, but can't do anything.. Miresnare Love my 6p. Never had an issue with it apart from the slo-mo on the camera. Wonderful device. Rob Paek My 6P shut off abruptly right after it gave me the 15% warning the other day. Other than that it has been freezing lately and forcing me to reboot. lance colton Suing is great and all, but every AMERICAN class action lawsuit does absolutely nothing for those of us that aren't in the USA. All the times Nvidia and Sony got sued for stuff they sold me that didn't work as advertised, I'm entitled to NOTHING. This phone is such garbage. Just got it back from the bootloop repair, and the battery starts dying at 20% left. Then 40%. Yesterday, 60%. WTF. I don't think it's Google's fault, though. They would have fixed the software if they can by now. More like Huawei built this thing out of garbage, so it actually needs to be replaced after a year. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/776a4957bbcf9a86578fe290eba3107f160fabf3d0d520adb81993f61d67cca0.png You wouldn't believe the trouble I had getting this thing in for repairs either. I bought it from my carrier so I can't deal with Google or Huawei. They do troubleshooting but for warranty I have to deal with 'Freedom mobile'. I have to go into a certain shopping mall and go to a specific kiosk that is a designated repair center. They refused to honor the terms of the warranty, specifically that the original bootloop repair gives me 90 days more warranty. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/735c6d189c2684ae884f4c97c0d443766058dfa8c7119577c26c17b6da30b031.png Even the Huawei website says it's under warranty for a few more days. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/63182bf80270d912f90486d64178eff22d06e6ef98c0bbc1b1c6fcad3b6f4c62.png I had to give up at the kiosk, go to my car, and phone 611. Talked to an idiot that wastes my time with irrelevant troubleshooting, then she tries to tell me the warranty is expired too. Ask for a supervisor. Same story, but she speaks better English. I argue with her that they need to honor the terms on their website, but she says I'm not understanding them. I refuse to give up, she finally places me on hold for 5 min, comes back, admits I'm correct. I still have 3 days warranty according to her now. She puts a note on the account, then I go back to the kiosk, tell the guy there to read the note and finally he calls his manager, and figures out how to process the claim. If they didn't glue the stupid thing together, I'd replace the battery myself. They choose to make it un-repairable, they can fix it. Jeremy Miethker that means its going to bootloop soon. that is what happened to me Cindy Up until the April 2017 update, I was experiencing this same issue. My Nexus 6P would die with as much as 23% battery life left. oscar acevedo Oh that explains why my phone unexpectedly shuts down from time to time. Nexus 6P v7.1.2 blenderboy People still buy google devices like Pixel. Consumers vote with their money. The moment you buy a device you are promoting the brand. I don't think there will be any outcome for this lawsuit. This is just a publicity stunt. Samsung hardware is great, software is shit. Google software is ok but hardware partners do not work properly with Google(initial supply, firmware updates, warranty replacements). I am waiting for Pixel(maybe in 2 yrs) after seeing how current Pixel owners are treated by Google. Apple hardware is great, software works as expected. I use Linux at home and without itunes it is difficult to use a iPhone. So only option for me is Android. Charles Jordan I have the Nexus 6P a lotnd I have no issues and it's all updated. ThEGr33k Sent mi e of for RMA in the UK they did a "software update" to android 7 and sent it back. Safe to say the early shutdown and terrible battery life is still here... Have sent an email asking for the battery to be replaced so see what i hear back... Felipe I had my 6P fallen into the bootloop problem, I was given a replacement as Huawei honored its 15 months warranty (even though the documentation everywhere says it has 12 months factory warranty, it in fact has 15 months, with Huawei, but NOT with Google, shame Google!). Now, I'm about to get this replacement unit and pray, really pray hard that nothing new appears with this phone. Even tough there are now reports of replaced phones crashing again into the bootloop bug and, recently that Android 7.1.2 final, screwed the fingerprint sensor. Many are not liking the way Google+Huawei (yes, both) is handling this crisis, which in fact is a major one. I think customers who spent lots of hard earned money should get a quality device which keeps on working well, even after its warranty period expired and, wheren there is a well known massive problem, the manufacturer(s) Hardware+Software should honor fixes or reimburses, despite the fact that there are now the Pixels phones. If my replacement phone fails, I'd be more than willing to participate in a class action suit. Jeremy Miethker my brothers replacement phone already went into bootloop 5 days after receiving it. my phone died last week. Jacob Kraniak I thought I was going crazy when I noticed my 6P constantly rebooting on it's own. At least now I know I'm not alone with htis issue. Hopefully they give us something back in return. Maybe a replacement? Hell, I'd rather just return it at this point and use whatever credit they give me towards a Pixel or OP3T. that's not to say I haven't loved the 6P of course. Alexander Dumo Ive had this issue since updating my 6P sometime this past December. We shouldn't have to live with charging our phone before it hits approx 15%-20% battery life. When that warning pops up, the phone just shuts down. Make no sense...please fix this Huawei/Google! Charles Constantine I reported shutdowns at battery levels of 20-60 percentage remaining and was given a list of things to do including a "factory reset" and then told to report back by Google Project fi support. ARDankar I am glad I did not upgrade to nougat yet. Keep me posted on any news regarding issues with the Nexus 6P. David Droddy The Goog replaced my 6P very quickly when I demonstrated the sudden shut down problem even in safe mode and after full factory reset. Why would you report that Google is not responsive to this issue? Seanmiz Yep, I've experienced both issues on my 6P. I got hit with the bootloop of death a few months ago, luckily still under warranty with Huawei and got a replacement. I get the early battery shutdown usually in the 10-20% range. prwnd https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/cd48abb593ae6c1dd226cbe06ba45cf7195abd40318303b2290ca9229846939e.png Biojoe Me too. Travis Coble Oddly enough, sometimes it shuts down early, and sometimes it's fine. However, given my use of it and constant recharging, I'm convinced that this will end up going nowhere because the problem is actually pretty normal for devices that are going on two years of age due to the use of LIon batteries. People claiming shutdown at 60%? I'd need to see it to believe it... maverick7526 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/3b98bc27cfb84fed5d59d503e403949c6d1cd50a18f37dd23dc58235aba80ad6.png It happens. It happened to me in Feb. It was very cold out and the phone just shut off, and would not turn on again until it was plugged into a charger. Brett Crowley Mine just hit a random boot loop and recovery mode is not working. Jeremy Miethker once it bootloops there is nothing you can do. it is now a cool paper weight Hussain Ahmadi I really hope they sue google for this. 6P keeps restarting without any reason, not to forget the excessive freezing issues. Google is getting very arrogant and need some spanking Hussain Ahmadi And of course this will be the last phone I've ever buy from google. Waiting eagerly for Note 8 mercado79 Yes, both issues. The battery issue was covered under warranty directly by Google. The bootloop issue occurred 1 month out of warranty and both companies told me there‚Äã was nothing they could do for me. Marcin Nowak I had this issue since beginning of the year and Google forums just said wait for update. Finally contacted Google about it just last week feed up asking for help and they told me to F.off pretty much. zefred Got it. It started RIGHT after the one year mark. Contacted google AND Huawei, and was turned down by both. My N6p doesn't even last half a day with recharging. I need to carry extra external batteries everywhere with me, as well as a charge and cable, and the device is barely a year and a half old. NOT a happy camper :( 12321 Law360, Dallas (April 17, 2017, 5:29 PM EDT) -- Google Inc. and Huawei Technologies USA Inc. were hit with a putative class action in Texas federal court Friday over an allegedly defective smartphone, the Nexus 6P, which the user claims suffers from premature battery drainage. Plaintiff Alex Gorbatchev wants to represent a class of consumers who bought the Google Nexus 6P phones, which he says also suffer from a problem that sends the phone into a ‚Äúdeath spiral‚Äù in which the phones suddenly switch off and then restart in what is referred to as an... https://www.law360.com/texas/articles/913933/class-hits-google-with-suit-over-defective-nexus-phones https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bad-Cellphones.pdf Claude L Now it's getting worst with android 7.1.2. I was also experiencing early shutdown with my 6p when using 7.1.1. But now I'm unable to use my phone on a daily basis without having a early shutdown. Today again battery was at 20% and last week it happened at 37%. I was so happy when I bought my phone a year and a half ago because I was able to use it for the whole day without having to charge the battery... Now I have to carry a charger with me... It sucks theadb Anything we can do in Canada? Mine just shuts off randomly all the time. This is was a RMA from an older 6P that had massive battery issues. The guy I just spoke to said my original warranty was up in January this year and there was nothing he could do. This phone shuts down randomly all the time now. I've missed by alarm to wake up twice now because it just shuts off. Only way to power it back on is to go into bootloader and restart. adi sararu mine had his 20% dying today first time... and after reading above... my time to never touch google phones again :D Steve I had same battery problem with my 6p, rather than taking out a lawsuit against Google I just purchased a new battery and replaced it. Phone no longer has the issue, lawsuit closed Kyle Snider Phone shuts off early on me allllllll the time, does this lawsuit affect us in Canada? Adam Macias I'm suffering the premature battery death. I have yet to cross the boot loop issue though. God help me if I do. Jeremy Miethker well im a not so proud owner of a $800 dollar paper weight. i cant believe how this is being handled they want me to spend $550 to replace it than they will reimburse me. are you kidding me. however was wondering if this would happen again if i did get a new one? Jacob Lunsford My 6P shuts down with anywhere from 10-30% battery remaining. pi app my problem is the uber driver app stopped working on this phone about 2 weeks ago (same app was working fine on this phone for last 8 months). when i log into uber driver app on any other fine it works fine. a chinese person told me because huawei is a chinese company and they hate uber they may have done something to prevent the app from working on their phones. i was going to buy another nexus 6p to see if same problem occurs. then i will know. my battery's been fine with my phone. Svart Adam Solander My phone shutdown at around 20-25%. Quite annoying. sleepytinksy Also have this issue - phone shut down right before the gates opened for a soccer match and they only issued digital tickets, scan-able on the phone. As you can imagine, that was less than ideal. Panda without dark circle My 6p shut down at 35% or below when I travel to Japan on winter, I thought it was because of the cold. But when I back to Malaysia, it shut down at 60% or below, not every time but this scared me. :( And yes, it doesn't warning me at all, shut down without any sign. Ahmad Zaib I am from India and facing the same issue on my Nexus 6P. The Huawei customer care response has been that they are coming up with an official response soon. This has been the status since more than 3 weeks now. Anyone here, who knows what can we expect here or how do we proceed? Tom Z 71% (seventy-one percent) Shutdown! Mine just hit a new low (or high) with this issue. I just had mine shut down at 71% (seventy-one percent) remaining battery life. This is a very big problem. I was taking pictures when the phone just went into shut down. I couldn't get it to stay running until I connected power. This needs to be fixed! I'm on the latest version with April 2017 security updates. Tom boses Same issue here. I'm reaching the shutdown at about about 38% mark! I'm frustrated at Google's inaction! Jay Miller Mine has died anywhere from 43% to 15%. It is random battery percentage for the shutdown, but it always claims it is at 15% then shuts down. The minute you plug it in and turn it on, the battery percentage is what it really shut off at, and it is usually in the high 20's. So yesterday I tried something. I went to the factory images I had for my Nexus, and through ADB, I sent it "back in time" to Android 6.0 (original release firmware). I then put it to the test. I turned on the hotspot and started playing games that I know drain the battery. I got the warning at 15%....no shutdown. I continued further. I got a warning at 14%, at 12%, 10%, 5% and eventually it shutdown at 1%. I placed it on the charger and fired it up and it was "truly" at 1% battery. I haven't seen it fully drain in months. While the claim that new batteries work, it also appears that Google has work to do on their end as well. Reversing the firmware did work for me. However, the device wanted to update immediately. I accepted the security patch, but at this point in time I will refuse to upgrade back to Nougat if I can gain the full use of my phone without it shutting off prematurely. Here is my log: Firmware I was on 05/03/2017 at 11 AM Eastern US time: N2G47H (April 2017 Security Patch) Firmware I reversed it to on 05/03/2017 at 12 PM Eastern US time: MDA89D (September 2015) Firmware after accepting most recent security patch OTA on 05/03/2017 at 6:45 PM Eastern US time: MTC19T (Android 6.0.1 but security is May 2016) Mister Sonny I'm having the early shutdown issue, for me it's consistently at around 25% battery life. This is made worse by the fact that I have an accessory almost always connected (Fitbit Blaze) NumbGrip I've been having this problem since about 6 weeks ago and it started completly out of nowhere Vince Romeo I've encountered the boot loop problem on 6p after <18 mo. Occasionally sudden shutdowns before that happened. My wife's phone is ~19+ and has sudden shutdown issues. ‚Üê ¬†Older Comments ¬†‚Üí Follow Android Police 1.49M 467k 142k 113k Latest Deals 0 [Deal Alert] Costco offering cash cards, charging kits, and more for Galaxy S8/S8+ activations 2017/05/05 6:53pm PDTMay 5, 2017 3 [Deal Alert] Fossil smartwatches discounted 25% everywhere 2017/05/05 11:36am PDTMay 5, 2017 15 [Deal Alert] Finish off the week with 44 temporarily free and 12 on-sale apps 2017/05/05 9:06am PDTMay 5, 2017 17 [Update: Groupon] Deal Alert: Bragi's truly wireless earbuds, The Dash, are $100 on Woot for a refurbished pair ($200 off) 2017/05/05 1:10am PDTMay 5, 2017 15 [Deal Alert] Unlocked Sony Xperia XZs down to $620 at Amazon ($64 off) 2017/05/04 7:35pm PDTMay 4, 2017 Latest Poll Do you use a screen protector on your phone?

Android Pay v1.22 prepares Visual ID facial recognition based on Hands Free and reveals testing for Brazil, Trinidad & Tobago, and Canada [APK Teardown] Cody Toombs Follow View All Posts 2017/05/05 1:23pm PDTMay 5, 2017 37 Plus 1 on G+ 23 Share on Facebook 46 Share on Twitter Total Shares106 APK Teardown Applications Downloads News Article Contents 1 Teardown 1.1 New Currencies 1.2 Hands Free returns as Visual ID 1.3 Testing and error reporting tools 2 Download Android Pay may not have had a massive launch, or has it been as aggressively rolled out as Samsung Pay, but it is steadily setting up shop in more countries around the globe. If you don't happen to find yourself in one of the dozen countries that have either already seen a launch or at least have an official promise of one coming soon, you might be interested to know that Google has at least set its sights on a few other countries. Text in the latest update of the Android Pay app hints at four previously unannounced markets. There are also obvious signs Google is merging the recently closed Hands Free experiment into Android Pay and expanding it significantly. Teardown Disclaimer: Teardowns are based on evidence found inside of apks (Android's application package) and are necessarily speculative and usually based on incomplete information. It's possible that the guesses made here are totally and completely wrong. Even when predictions are correct, there is always a chance that plans could change or may be canceled entirely. Much like rumors, nothing is certain until it's officially announced and released. The features discussed below are probably not live yet, or may only be live for a small percentage of users. Unless stated otherwise, don't expect to see these features if you install the apk. New Currencies The evidence for this one comes in the form of a new list of currency codes. Most of them relate to countries where Android Pay is already active, or at least Google has already said it will be soon. However, four of them belong to countries that haven't been officially announced yet. The list of currencies includes: Brazilian Real Trinidad & Tobago Dollar Irish Pound Canadian Dollar Correction: Ireland was added in December 2016. I was using an incorrect source list that was missing the rollout to AIB, KBC, and Ulster Bank. Thanks,¬†Daniel Brierton and Ail√≠n √ì'S. Of course, a teardown already told us last year that Canada is on the list, but Google hasn't actually taken the plunge to publicly commit. The other three are new. Rumors have circulated about all of them, particularly Brazil, which has been more officially mentioned by companies involved with the rollout of NFC-based payment terminals. Nevertheless, there haven't been any official statements about expansion into these countries by Google. Currency Codes <string-array name="currency_code"> <item>Please make a selection</item> <item>USD</item> <item>GBP</item> <item>SGD</item> <item>AUD</item> <item>HKD</item> <item>BRL</item>¬† // Brazilian Real <item>TTD</item>¬† // Trinidad & Tobago Dollar <item>PLN</item> <item>IEP</item>¬† // Irish pound <item>CAD</item>¬† // Canadian Dollar <item>JPY</item> <item>NZD</item> <item>OTHER</item> </string-array> This list doesn't appear to actually serve a purpose for regular users. Rather, it appears to be a tool for testers that need to switch currencies while working with payment terminals. As such, I'm not so sure the list won't be removed in the future, but at least it gives us some insight into what's coming. Unfortunately, it also doesn't tell us when to expect a launch in these new locales. Naturally, we'll keep an eye out for new information as it becomes available. A quick note about currencies: I copied Google's names for the currency codes directly. It's possible the Android Pay developers don't actually mean for IEP to be the Irish Pound, but may be using it as a symbolic reference to the Euro when it's used in Ireland. That would make sense if there are different rules or tax laws at processing time. Hands Free returns as Visual ID Many people probably didn't pay much attention to the Hands Free trial Google launched in and around its home base last year. To summarize, it's basically a new way to complete an in-person transaction without using a phone or card. Actually, you still need your phone with you because it relies on the various technologies that make up location services (i.e. Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS); but Instead of tapping it to a payment terminal, customers say "I'll pay with Google" and give their initials to the cashier, then their identity is confirmed using a camera and Google's facial recognition technology. A couple of months ago, the pilot program for Hands Free was shuttered, but Google left it with a somewhat promising message that hinted it wasn't really dead. Now it's clear why the message was so upbeat: Google is rolling Hands Free into Android Pay. It appears the feature will be branded Visual ID. code <string name="handsfree_landing_text1">It‚Äôs as simple as snapping a picture</string> <string name="handsfree_landing_text2">A camera will recognize you at the register</string> <string name="handsfree_landing_text3">Your points will be applied automatically</string> <string name="handsfree_landing_title">Never miss out on points again</string> <string name="handsfree_landing_title1">One-time setup</string> <string name="handsfree_landing_title2">Works like magic</string> <string name="handsfree_landing_title3">Just pay &amp; go</string> <string name="handsfree_learn_more">Learn more about Visual ID</string> <string name="handsfree_setting_title">Visual ID</string> <string name="handsfree_skip_button_title">Skip</string> <string name="handsfree_turn_on_button">Turn on</string> <string name="handsfree_welcome_button">See how it works</string> <string name="handsfree_photo_setup_title">Snap a picture of yourself</string> <string name="handsfree_photo_setup_subtitle">This will help Android Pay recognize you at the register</string> <string name="handsfree_permissions_title">Visual ID uses location &amp; Bluetooth</string> <string name="handsfree_permissions_text">Make sure you have both turned on so that Android Pay can recognize you at the register</string> <string name="handsfree_photo_error_subtitle">Make sure the photo clearly shows your face with no one else in the frame</string> <string name="handsfree_photo_error_title">Let‚Äôs try that again</string> Google promises to keep privacy intact by never sharing your picture with the merchant and deleting any images taken by its cameras within the store. Obviously, that doesn't impact the store's own cameras. <string name="handsfree_consent_text_identity_text">Google creates and stores a face template based on the photo you save during setup. When you're at a participating store, Visual ID will automatically confirm your identity using facial recognition technology (your face template is compared to the image captured by the in-store Visual ID camera). Images captured by the in-store Visual ID camera can't be accessed by the store and are deleted shortly after they're captured. They‚Äôre not stored or saved.</string> Also worth noting is that this doesn't prevent customers from enjoying their loyalty cards. Google will also match stored membership cards with the merchant and automatically apply them when your identity is confirmed. code <string name="handsfree_consent_subtitle">Visual ID is a secure way to confirm your identity at participating stores, making it easier to do things like earn loyalty points and redeem rewards.</string> <string name="handsfree_loyalty_card_message">Visual ID is on and your loyalty points will be automatically applied at checkout</string> <string name="handsfree_setting_description">At participating stores, Android Pay will recognize you at the register and automatically apply your loyalty points</string> <string name="handsfree_loyalty_card_error_message">Your photo has not uploaded.

You can turn Visual ID off at any time by changing your Android Pay settings.</string> Visual ID will require a camera mounted at checkout locations in stores, which means it's probably not going to become a widespread feature anytime soon. However, if it can garner lower transaction fees from banks or offer unique benefits for stores where customers actually need truly hands-free purchasing ‚Äì picture Starbucks and other places where people often carry things in and out without having time to organize ‚Äì it may catch on in a few places pretty quickly. Testing and error reporting tools While it's not at all important to us as users, there were some other bits included with this release for use by testers. When issues arise during use, they can report the nature of the test and what issues came up. The "engagement type" lists the type of tests, including: Ninja Field Testing (I love this name), Smoke Testing, Country Launch Testing, and Other. I don't have much to say about the rest of it, but for those that are curious, take a look at the rest of the reporting options. code <string-array name="engagement_type"> <item>Please make a selection</item> <item>Ninja Field Testing</item> <item>Smoke Testing</item> <item>Country Launch Testing</item> <item>Other</item> </string-array> <string-array name="hiccup_type"> <item>Please make a selection</item> <item>Unexpected keyguard</item> <item>Repeated keyguard</item> <item>Multiple taps required</item> <item>No hiccups</item> <item>Other</item> </string-array> <string-array name="terminal_message"> <item>Please make a selection</item> <item>Approved</item> <item>Decline</item> <item>Insert card</item> <item>Present one card</item> <item>Card type not accepted</item> <item>Terminal froze/crashed</item> <item>Terminal restarted</item> <item>Other</item> </string-array> <string-array name="terminal_type"> <item>Please make a selection</item> <item>Veriphone vx 820</item> <item>Veriphone vx 520</item> <item>Other</item> </string-array> <string-array name="user_perceived_result"> <item>Please make a selection</item> <item>Success no problems</item> <item>Success with hiccups</item> <item>Failure</item> </string-array> Download The APK is signed by Google and upgrades your existing app. The cryptographic signature guarantees that the file is safe to install and was not tampered with in any way.

Here in Ireland we've used the Euro since 2002, why would they add support for a dead currency? And we've already got android pay anyway... Cody Toombs I searched Google for the currency code and copied what they had listed for IEP. Perhaps the Android Pay developers don't actually mean for it to be the Irish Pound, but just using it ass a symbolic reference to the Euro when it's used in Ireland. That would make sense if there are different rules or tax laws at processing time. Daniel Brierton Also, Android Pay is already available in Ireland with AIB and KBC. Ail√≠n √ì‚ÄôS And Ulster Bank too since the other day. Cody Toombs Thanks for the heads up to both you and @Popple3:disqus. I've updated the article to clarify that Ireland isn't new. Ail√≠n √ì‚ÄôS No worries Cody. I'm still truly confused about the references to Irish Punt though üòÇüòÖ ozone89 Meanwhile, I'm tied to BOI üò© Ail√≠n √ì‚ÄôS They'll launch with Samsung Pay in a month or so. I'm sure of it üòÇ Ail√≠n √ì‚ÄôS The reference to "Irish Pound" is bizarre. That currency which we called Punt (Irish for Pound) hasn't been in use since the early 2000s when we switched to ‚Ç¨, and anyway, we have had Android Pay since December 2016. Bizarre. Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà So, can I tape a picture of a rich person over my face, and use their credit card data and buy really expensive stuff? DavidW username checks out Matt If you steal their credit card and google account information....no. Assuming the person wouldn't ring you up if you were wearing a mask. Matt It seems like installing facial recognition cameras in stores is a lot more difficult than a screen that just shows them a picture of me. It's not like they don't know what I look like - they're looking right at me. mike shwilly News articles say that Android Pay will be launched in Russia on 16th May Cody Toombs Yeah, Russia and South Korea have been confirmed either by Google, partners, or other companies involved in the rollout. They're definitely happening this year, but the dates have always been a little sloppy. I think we'll see at least a half dozen other countries by the end of the year, and maybe more. The adoption rate has been picking up. newtonfb Still waiting for Paypal to be activated.... HUEHUE BR OMG BRAZIIIIIIIL Renan Oh my god, I think I've wet my pants when I saw Brazil getting Android Pay love. God please yes! Ail√≠n √ì‚ÄôS Are NFC/Contactless terminals and Contactless debit/credit cards common in Brazil? Renan Not at all :P At least not where I live... but, to be honest, I've never asked, because I can't use even Samsung Pay (which seems to be supported here) because my old S5 doesn't seems to support it (and I'm using Lineage OS, anyway). But having support will increase interest, which will make more and more terminals to support NFC/contactless and will make contactless cards more common (or at least I hope so) Ail√≠n √ì‚ÄôS Ah, that's good Samsung Pay is there, hopefully that is encouraging Contactless take up. I suppose maybe Brazil relies a lot on the old card swipe technology and hence Samsung Pay would be of great use? When you go to pay with card don't you ever see the Contactless symbol there? I know nothing about the Brazilian payments market hence my curiosity üòÇ Thalles Ferreira Look, don't know where Renan lives in Brazil, not telling he's wrong, we're the size of a continent... But in S√£o Paulo and Rio, contactless terminals are now very common, many of them with stickers of Samsung Pay or NFC symbol. About the bank technology, it's bizarre, but Brazil uses by a decade or more the chip technology that US struggles to implement now. Here it's one of the most technical‚Äãadvanced in financial market of the world (sorry about this sentence, my English ain't that good). But paying with cell phone is awkward for most people here... It looks like a Jetsons future lol. But there are banks taking the next step, removing physical use of banks (only auto terminals) or changing the old numeric password for biometrics, not only in the app but in the terminals too. If you have other questions, I'm glad to explain, as I love the theme lol Fernando Pena Actually, they are pretty common. Most credit card terminals in Brasil are NFC supported these days (those from CIELO, REDE etc), they usually have a symbol near the screen that indicates it's supported. But many people don't know that... I have friends that use NFC payments all the time, from banks like "Banco do Brasil". Fernando Pena I really hope Nubank is related to this Android Pay initiative in Brasil. They are promising this for quite some time (maybe a year by now) and I use their card A LOT.

RSS ALL ARTICLES FEATURES ONLY Search How to Access a Web Page When It‚Äôs Down By Chris Hoffman on May 5th, 2017 Nothing ever vanishes completely from the Internet. Whether a web page has been down for a few minutes or a few years, there are a few ways you can view its content anyway. Option One: Google Cache Google and other search engines download and keep copies of the web pages they index. if a web page is down, you can easily view the most recent copy cached by Google. If you‚Äôre trying to access a web page from Google search, it‚Äôs easy to access the cached copy. Just click the back button in your web browser when the web page doesn‚Äôt load. Click the arrow to the right of the web page‚Äôs address, and click ‚ÄúCached‚Äù to view the old copy. If the page appears to be taking a long time to load, you can click the ‚ÄúText-only version‚Äù link at the top of the cached page. The web page will load instantly, but you won‚Äôt see any images. This is necessary when the website‚Äôs server is down and your browser can‚Äôt load the web page‚Äôs images. You‚Äôll also see the date and time when Google created this cached copy displayed at the top of the page. There‚Äôs also quick way to view Google‚Äôs cached copy of any web page without going through Google search first. Just plug¬†the following address into your address bar, replacing example.com/page.htm with the full address of the web page you want to view. http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:example.com/page.htm Be sure to omit the ‚Äúhttp://‚Äù or ‚Äúhttps://‚Äù from the start of the web page‚Äôs address if you do this. So, if you wanted to view the cached copy of https://www.howtogeek.com/226280/how-to-take-screenshots-in-windows-10/ , you‚Äôd type: http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:www.howtogeek.com/226280/how-to-take-screenshots-in-windows-10/ While we focused on Google Cache here because most people use Google, Microsoft‚Äôs Bing search engine has its own similar feature. If you use Bing, you can click the¬†¬†down arrow to the right of an address and click ‚ÄúCached page‚Äù to view a copy from Bing‚Äôs cache. Option Two: The Wayback Machine The Internet Archive‚Äôs Wayback Machine also allows you to view older copies of a web page. Where Google Cache only offers you a single, most recent cached copy, the Wayback Machine offers multiple older versions of a web page going back much further, so you can see what a web page looked like years ago To use the Wayback Machine, head to the Wayback Machine page. Plug the full address of the web page you want to view into the box and click ‚ÄúBrowse History‚Äù. For example, you can copy and paste this address from your browser‚Äôs address bar if a web page doesn‚Äôt load. If you just want to view the most recently cached copy of a web page, you can click the date at the top of the archive page. If you want an older copy, you can select a year and click a date on the calendar to view the¬†web page as it appeared on that date. You can click links that appear on¬†the page after it loads to view other web pages as they appeared on that date. This tool allows you to browse entire websites that have disappeared or changed dramatically. You may also have heard of CoralCDN in the past. CoralCDN was particularly useful for viewing cached copies of web pages that went down due to sudden high traffic. However, CoralCDN is¬†now shut down. The above two tools should get you pretty far, though. JOIN THE DISCUSSION (1 REPLY) Got Feedback?

(AP Photo/Eric Risberg, File) FILE - In this Tuesday, Oct. 4, 2016, file photo, Google Home, right, sits on display near a Pixel phone following a product event, in San Francisco. Voice assistants such as Google Home, Apple‚Äôs Siri and Amazon Alexa have always been susceptible to accidental hijack. Burger King‚Äôs manipulation of Google Home illustrates the vulnerabilities intrinsic to voice assistants that can be targeted by brands, or worse, hackers. But the stunt might help speed up the next developments for home voice assistants: individual voice recognition and even image recognition. (AP Photo/Eric Risberg, File) Single page Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY (2) New York ‚Ä¢ Burger King pulled a pretty juicy marketing stunt last month that drew plenty of attention ‚Äî not just to the Whopper, but also to the intrinsic vulnerabilities of a new type of voice-activated gadget. The fast food chain's 15-second television ad targeted Google Home, a speaker that can answer questions and control other smart appliances. When an actor in the ad said "OK, Google" and asked a question about the Whopper, Google Home obediently began reading the burger's ingredients in homes around the country ‚Äî effectively extending the commercial for however long it took someone to shout "OK, Google, stop!" VIDEOS TOP JOBS Google and Wikipedia quickly made fixes to shut it down. Though annoying, the stunt may have done some good by highlighting how easy it is to hijack such devices. (Just imagine a burglar spying a voice assistant and asking it to unlock all the doors.) It could also speed the development of home voice assistants with better security. "It's a wakeup call," said Earl Perkins, a digital security analyst at the research firm Gartner. "It's a harbinger of things to come." TRIGGER WARNING Voice assistants such as Google Home, Apple's Siri and Amazon's Echo devices have always been susceptible to accidental hijack. A Google ad during the Super Bowl that used the phrase "OK, Google" reportedly set off people's devices. And in a January story that briefly turned a family into media celebrities, a woman's 6-year old daughter ordered a dollhouse and sugar cookies simply by asking Amazon's voice assistant Alexa for them. Since the devices are so new ‚Äî the Amazon Echo debuted in 2015, Google Home last year ‚Äî they're still having growing pains. And they're growing in popularity; Consumer Intelligence Research Partners estimates that Amazon sold 3 million Echo devices in the U.S. in the fourth quarter of 2016, bringing the total to more than 8 million. Amazon doesn't release sales figures. Many experts believe that deliberate attempts to trigger voice assistants will be short-lived. Among other things, brands have to face the consequences of potentially annoying millions of people. "Burger King was doing what the Burger King brand is known to do, stir controversy and make sure it gets lots of coverage," Forrester principal analyst James McQuivey said. "Very few brands want to do that." Of course, spammers and other bottom-feeding marketers can still try to implement the technique. But voice assistants already have a few ways to block them. THREATS AND COUNTERMEASURES Amazon already makes sure its TV commercials and those of its partners can't inadvertently trigger the speaker. Developers that provide Echo with "skills" that let it, for instance, order pizza, are also prohibited from creating Alexa commands that would trigger ads. Google says it also has techniques to block TV ads from activating Google Home. Neither company provided details on those techniques. Voice assistants are still in their "very early days," Google says; the company plans to "monitor and learn as we go." Hackers might also be a threat. But because voice assistants are so new and limited in scope, more established connected devices such as webcams, routers and printers pose more of a threat for now. "It's not that we won't see some creative or unique instance (of hacking), but I don't think this is going to be the next great wave of cybercrime," said Steve Grobman, chief technology officer at the security company McAfee. MORE SECURITY TO COME But before long, the devices are going to need better security. "When you move into a world of voice, some of the rules that we're accustomed to, related to security for computers, change," Gartner's Perkins said. Exactly how that works could depend on exactly what task a voice assistant is performing. Asking about the weather requires less security than say, shopping or accessing a bank account. ¬ª Next page...

After several years of service, the Google Play Top Developer program is being put to rest Jordan Palmer Follow View All Posts 2017/05/05 3:20pm PDTMay 5, 2017 15 Plus 1 on G+ 23 Share on Facebook 43 Share on Twitter Total Shares81 Google News The Top Developers program launched several years ago¬†as a method of drawing attention to devs who put out great apps. We all started seeing the little blue arrow badge next to some of the developers' names, but it got easy to grow accustomed and eventually jaded to it.¬† The time has come, it seems, to say goodbye to the program. Google has sent out an email to some developers discussing the eclipse of the Top Developers badge and system, but there's also a promise of something new on the horizon. The Play Store's app recognition methodology¬†will soon have more of a focus on individual apps and games that are worth noting, instead of an entire dev account. Here's the email: "The Google Play Top Developer program was created to recognize partners who developed top quality Android apps and games Every day developers like you are hard at work creating apps and games on Android. Whether you‚Äôre updating an existing app or building something new, we‚Äôve seen an incredible increase in the level of polish and quality in so many fun, entertaining, and useful apps. We want to make sure more people find the great experiences you are creating. The Google Play Top Developer program launched many years ago to recognize developers who created high quality Android apps and games. We conducted research, with both developers and consumers, and observed a clear value and preference for the recognition of individual apps and games, instead of entire organizations. After taking a look at our existing app recognition programs, the Google Play editorial team has decided to focus its efforts on recognizing high quality and innovative apps and games. As a first step, we will be closing the Top Developer program and removing the badging from the Play Store within 30 days. We have exciting plans to recognize more of the great apps and games you create and will be sharing updates soon. We thank you for your continued commitment to Android and Google Play." It's hard to say that this is a bad thing.¬†It will be interesting to see what Google has up its sleeve for the future of app recognition in the Play Store.

Artem Russakovskii The top developer badge stopped being meaningful to me when I saw it given out to developers with lots of bought users, reviews, tons of IAPs, etc. What I'd much rather see is a verified check mark similar to Twitter, Facebook, and G+ so people can be assured they're looking at the right dev account and not a copycat. YaKillaCJ This right here. I feel like what's needed is an Official Badge to recognized Apps. This way the average person doesn't get tricked. NooSH we need "top messaging apps".

The report raises the question of whether Alphabet needs to buy a company to help Google make some inroads with enterprise customers. By Tiernan Ray Updated May 5, 2017 8:33 p.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large Goldman Sachs analysts Heather Bellini¬†and¬†Heath Terry, and colleagues today issued an interesting report that summarizes points from a discussion about¬†cloud¬†computing that has implications for Alphabet¬†(GOOGL). The authors spoke with RightScale, a firm that helps enterprises make the transition to cloud computing. RightScale¬†CEO Michael Crandall told them about the trends his customers, and their views on Google, on Microsoft‚Äôs (MSFT) Azure¬†cloud service, and on Amazon¬†(AMZN). One takeaway the authors had was that Google‚Äôs cloud service is still ‚Äúfar behind Amazon and Azure.‚Äù sThat‚Äôs based on the fact that RightScale only 15% of customers report having used Google. That‚Äôs up from 10% a year earlier, but far below the 60% or so who report having used Amazon, and the 30% who report having used Azure. Crandall told the analysts that Google has ‚Äúthe simplest and most cost-effective structure‚Äù for public cloud computing, which allows people to save money with things like ‚Äúcontinued-use discounts." However, Crandall tells Goldman that "in order to be successful, GCP must fully embrace the push into enterprise,‚Äù referring to Google‚Äôs cloud service, "potentially through an acquisition that would provide it with greater access into the enterprise market." "Specifically, he believes that the acquisition of a managed service provider or system integrator could make sense to add enterprise credibility, moreso than the acquisition of a cloud application."

The weekend has arrived once more, and that means it‚Äôs time to pause and catch our breaths, as we look back on another exciting week across the tech world. There were some major announcements, a few juicy rumors, and one or two surprises ‚Äì and as ever, 7 Days is here to make sure you know exactly what‚Äôs been happening. Our journey begins this week in China, where authorities are apparently preparing to launch an alternative to Wikipedia, bringing together "the biggest, most high-quality author team" in the world. Underneath the obnoxiously large watermark in the image above, you'll see Fitbit's new smartwatch, which was revealed in leaked pictures alongside a new set of Bluetooth earbuds. Qualcomm is reportedly preparing to ask the International Trade Commission to enforce an import ban on iPhones entering the United States. Apple recently stopped paying royalties to some of Qualcomm's partners in China, amid a bitter dispute between the two companies over Qualcomm's licensing fees. Next week, Qualcomm will announce details of its new Snapdragon 660 processor chipset Mobile Platform for upper-mid-range devices. Rival chipmaker Intel finally patched a security vulnerability that has existed in some of its products for almost a decade. An email phishing scam attempted to ensnare users by linking to a shared Google Docs file, which routed users through a legitimate Google sign-in page, before a fake app requested authorization to access their emails. Meanwhile, Google made changes to Gmail's security warnings to offer greater protection against phishing attempts. O2, part of Spanish telecommunications giant Telef√≥nica, revealed that some of its customers had had their bank accounts accessed by unknown third parties, as the result of a phishing attack combined with a known flaw in the SS7 protocol. A hacker, going by the name 'The Dark Overlord', leaked episodes of the upcoming season of hit Netflix show Orange Is The New Black, after the company ignored demands for a ransom payment. The same hacker claims to have possession of a further 36 unreleased movies and TV shows, and has again threatened to release them online unless a payment is made. Netflix content can now be viewed in 4K via the Microsoft Edge browser or the official Netflix app on Windows 10, thanks to a new preview driver from Nvidia for its GeForce GTX 10xx-series graphics cards. Samsung is hoping to attract more buyers to its Galaxy S8 flagships by offering them a free six-month Netflix subscription, 64GB microSD EVO+ card, and a Clear View Standing Cover. Samsung began rolling out a software fix for red-tinted displays on the Galaxy S8 and S8+ in Europe, and on T-Mobile in the US, but another issue popped up this week, causing some of those devices to randomly reboot. Buyers of LG's new G6 on T-Mobile can now get the device with $150 off, along with a free Google Home speaker and an LG G Pad X 8.0 tablet. LG is reportedly working on a 'G6 mini', which could prove popular among those who prefer a more compact flagship. HTC won't officially unveil its new U 11 flagship until later this month - but thanks to a leak, it seems we now know all of its key specs. OnePlus confirmed that its new Android flagship (gosh, there sure are a lot of flagships these days...) will be called the OnePlus 5, and will launch this summer. The company is skipping over the 'OnePlus 4' moniker as that number is considered unlucky in Chinese culture. Google published its latest breakdown of Android usage, revealing that just 0.5% of active devices are running the latest Android release, version 7.1. Android 7.0 is now up to just 6.6%, almost nine months after its rollout began. That long, slow rollout continues, reaching more devices this week: Samsung Galaxy S6, S6 edge and S6 active on AT&T Samsung Galaxy S6 edge+ on T-Mobile Samsung Galaxy A5 (2016) Honor 6X Google released its latest monthly Android security update, and published new factory and OTA images for its supported Nexus and Pixel devices. Details emerged of a new Android tablet in development by Motorola, with a 'premium look and feel', cellular connectivity, and a 'productivity mode', enabling users to pin apps to the nav bar. With Google's latest update to Chrome on Windows, version 58.0.3029.96, users with a 64-bit version of the OS running a 32-bit version of the browser will be automatically migrated to the 64-bit browser, if they have auto-update enabled. Google is getting ready to launch a major redesign of YouTube, including support for a dark theme - and it's got some big names onboard to support its stylish new look. Google and The Raspberry Pi Foundation teamed up to offer a low-cost cardboard kit that makers can use to build their own version of Google Home, including voice control support through the Google Assistant SDK. We've known since November that Amazon is working on a new Echo device, powered by its Alexa digital assistant, featuring a touchscreen and improved speakers - and the first images of that device appeared on Friday. Apple will reportedly unveil its own high-end rival to the Amazon Echo at its Worldwide Developer Conference next month. The new voice-controlled speaker is said to have a cylindrical design, similar to that of the Mac Pro, and - unsurprisingly - will support Apple's Siri digital assistant. Apple published its latest earnings report, revealing details of a very strong quarter for its services business, but a slight decline in iPhone sales, and a big drop in iPad sales. Apple promised to invest $1 billion in US manufacturing, and claimed that it's responsible for creating two million jobs across the country, despite only employing 80,000 people. Kensington released a new fingerprint scanner for PCs, priced at $50. The VeriMark sensor connects to a device via a USB port, and supports Windows Hello and FIDO. Toshiba's new Port√©g√© X30 is a Windows 10 notebook that also supports Windows Hello biometric authentication, and promises enterprise-class security through a range of features, including TPM 2.0, BitLocker Drive Encryption, a Smart Card reader, and more, priced from $1,449. You don't need to spend a fortune to get Windows Hello support, though. The ASUS Transformer Mini is a 10.1-inch Windows 10 tablet that weighs just 790g with the keyboard attached, and has 4GB RAM, 64GB storage, and a kickstand similar to Microsoft's Surface tablets. The best bit is the price: it's now available in the US for just $249, including the keyboard and pen. Microsoft is offering some big discounts on its Surface products in the UK. All Surface Pro 4 models are now available with up to 19% off, while Surface Book i7 models (excluding those with the new Performance Base) can now be purchased with up to ¬£665 off, along with free Bowers & Wilkins headphones worth ¬£119.99. Microsoft also introduced its new Surface Arc Mouse, priced at $79.99, and available in three colors. Two of the Arc Mouse colors match those of the new Surface Laptop, which Microsoft unveiled on Tuesday at an education-focused event in New York City. Unlike previous Surface devices, the Laptop isn't attempting to define a new product category - beneath its (very!) pretty design, it's a surprisingly ordinary notebook, with its only truly distinguishing feature being the Alcantara fabric trim applied to its keyboard area. And while it has a touchscreen, and supports the Surface Pen, the display can't even be pushed back 180-degrees, so if you want to write on its screen, you'll have to do something like this: Here it is. RT @SurfaceProArt @thurrott From a reader at TabletPCReview forums. pic.twitter.com/1f8a71oNth ‚Äî Paul Thurrott (@thurrott) May 4, 2017 The Surface Laptop certainly has premium pricing to match its premium styling - the entry-level model, which has just 4GB of RAM, and a 128GB SSD, costs $999, or ¬£979 in the UK. For unexplained reasons, the four color options are only available on one model - the Core i5 version with 8GB RAM and 256GB SSD; but in the UK, and other markets, only the silver ("Platinum") color is offered across the entire range. And even though you could be paying up to $2,199 for the range-topping model, you'll still have limited connectivity options: you'll only get one USB 3.0 Type-A port, a Mini DisplayPort, and a 3.5mm headphone jack. There's no microSD slot, and no USB-C support either, even though one of Microsoft's own promotional videos showed a Surface Laptop prototype with two USB Type-C ports. Check out our hands-on first impressions of the Surface Laptop to find out more. The Surface Laptop is also the first device to come with the new Windows 10 S edition, previously known as 'Windows 10 Cloud'. Windows 10 S only allows apps to be installed from the Windows Store, offering more security on devices, and limiting the impact of malware and viruses. It should also deliver better battery performance, thanks to restrictions on background tasks and services for apps installed from the Store. It will also prevent users from changing the default browser (Edge) and search engine (Bing). Windows 10 S is primarily intended for the education market, but it still comes pre-installed on the Surface Laptop for consumers, although Microsoft is offering a free upgrade to Windows 10 Pro for those who buy the device until the end of the year. Anyone else who wants to upgrade a device that comes with Windows 10 S to the Pro edition will have to pay around $49 to do so. Since Windows 10 S devices can only run apps from the Windows Store, Microsoft also announced that its Office 365 desktop applications are also "coming soon" to the Store. Spotify is coming to the Windows Store as well - but as it will be a simple Desktop Bridge 'conversion' of its existing desktop app, it will only be available for Windows 10 PCs, and not for other devices like phones or the Xbox One. Cloud storage service MEGA will soon launch an app in the Windows Store too, built on Microsoft's Universal Windows Platform, and available on PCs and phones. By the way, Microsoft has another launch event coming up later this month. The company revealed on Thursday that it "will show the world what's next" at an event in Shanghai on May 23, where it's likely to unveil its new Surface Pro 5. Last weekend, Neowin exclusively revealed that Microsoft is planning to separate development of its Edge web browser from Windows 10 when it releases its next major update to the OS in September. The Windows 10 Creators Update, which is currently rolling out to consumers, is the most recent such update for the OS. This week, Microsoft detailed some of the improvements to Edge that that update includes for IT pros and enterprise admins. Meanwhile, Edge's share of the desktop browser market remains stagnant, while Chrome has increased its share to 63.45% since last month. Microsoft brought its Focused Inbox feature to Outlook 2016, making it available to all users in the Office 365 First Release program - a big step towards rolling it out for everyone. The company also released a new Outlook for Mac Insider Preview to the Fast ring, and finally added Outlook to its Office Insider Program on iOS. Microsoft Teams - the firm's "chat-based workspace" app for Office 365 - got a big update with some handy new features on iOS and Windows 10 Mobile. Last week, when Microsoft published its quarterly earnings report, I pointed out that its phone hardware business is now dead, with negligible revenue, and no new devices coming anytime soon. But Microsoft Technical Fellow Alex Kipman went even further this week, effectively declaring that the era of the smartphone is over: "The phone is already dead," he said. "People just haven't realized." Microsoft's CEO Satya Nadella had a slightly different take on things, saying: "I'm sure we will make more phones, but they will not look like phones that are there today." Could he be referring to Westworld-style foldable phones? Well... we can dream - but it's probably best not to get your hopes up. Microsoft is continuing to work on Windows 10 Mobile in a separate 'feature2' branch, having split its development from the main Redstone 3 (RS3) branch a few weeks ago. It released a new Windows 10 Mobile Insider Preview, build 15210, to the Fast ring on Wednesday. On the same day, Windows 10 build 16188 rolled out to PCs in the Fast ring from the RS3 branch, bringing a range of additions and improvements, including a new Cortana section in the Settings app, new Edge PDF Reader functionality, a better update experience, and more. The fixes and known issues for that build can be found here. It seems clear that Windows 10 development for PCs is currently proceeding at a far greater pace than for phones. Windows 10 has apparently reached a plateau on Valve's Steam gaming platform, after hitting an all-time high of 51.2% of gamers there last month. Valve announced an overhaul of its gifting system, and revealed a range of improvements to its customer support system. Xbox chief Phil Spencer said he believes that Microsoft's first-party studios should be "a beacon of innovation for how our platform is being used". He cited Gears of War 4 as an example of this, with its introduction of cross-play between Xbox One consoles and Windows 10 PCs. Gears of War 4 got its latest update this week, with two new maps, multi-GPU support on Windows 10 PCs, and more. Microsoft added five more Xbox 360 games to its list of those playable on the Xbox One through its Backward Compatibility program. That list has been growing fast lately, and it won't be long before it reaches the next milestone of 400 titles. Nearly 11 years after the original game was released, the new Prey made its official debut on the Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and PC. Nvidia's latest GeForce driver update includes optimizations for the game. Sony revealed that it will hold its media briefing at the E3 gaming expo on June 12. Expect to see plenty of exciting announcements there, including a ton of awesome new games. However, Oculus confirmed that it's giving E3 a miss this year - the first time the virtual reality firm will be absent from the show since 2014. But our odyssey across the tech world ends this week with the beginning of a new journey across all of time and space. BBC iPlayer - which is exclusively available in the UK - will be streaming a special edition of this week's episode of Doctor Who, featuring immersive 3D binaural audio. But if you're not in the UK (or even if you are), you can enjoy a new Skype game bot developed by BBC Worldwide and Microsoft, in which you can help the Doctor to discover the pieces of the Key of Time, "an ancient and powerful artifact than could decide the fate of the universe". I've suddenly got a craving for some fish fingers and custard... Bonus content Before we wrap things up for another week, let me first highlight a couple of extra bits around the site that I hope you‚Äôll enjoy reading. Microsoft's spotlight was shining on its Surface Laptop this week, but the company also showcased a range of much more affordable PCs, some of which were priced as low as $229. Rich Woods took a closer look at some of those devices, which run Microsoft's new Windows 10 S edition.

Skip to content Naked Security Computer Security News, Advice and Research sophos.com Free Tools Go Award-winning computer security news Twitter Facebook Google+ LinkedIn Feed Update: Google Docs used for phishing? Not exactly 04 May 2017 10 Google, Malware, Phishing Post navigation Previous: NSA kept an eye on 151m phone records ‚Äì but wait, didn‚Äôt bulk collection stop three years ago? Next: Have you got what it takes to hack the US Air Force? by Bill Brenner 0Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Updated Friday, May 5, 6:55 AM London time, with comments from Sophos principal research scientist¬†Chester Wisniewski Since news began circulating last night of a phishing campaign parading around as Google Doc access links, the tale has taken strange twists and turns. A self-described graduate student claims he was behind the¬†blast of emails, and that they were part of a test for a school project, not a phishing attack. But according to the university he claims to be enrolled at, he‚Äôs not a student there. Meanwhile, as the hours pass, it becomes less clear if what Google users received was truly a phishing attempt. Sophos principal research scientist¬†Chester Wisniewski¬†says it wasn‚Äôt, exactly: First and foremost, this is an abuse of Google‚Äôs APIs. While at first glance it appears to be a phishing attack, the emails come from Google and you are logging into the real Google. Last night, news and social media sites were ablaze with word of a new phishing campaign using fake Google Doc sharing emails to lure its prey, arriving in messages like this: Those clicking the link got a¬†Google login and permissions page¬†asking that they¬†grant the fake Docs app¬†the ability to ‚Äúread, send, delete and manage your email‚Äù as well as manage your contacts: Rather than¬†coming from¬†the real Google Docs, this came from¬†a bogus app called ‚ÄúGoogle Docs.‚Äù Later, someone calling himself¬†Eugene Pupov took to Twitter claiming he sent the emails to test a program created¬†for a graduate final. It was in no way designed as a phishing attack, he said: Cries of phishing At the time of writing, Pupov hadn‚Äôt returned messages seeking comment (if he responds, we‚Äôll update this article). But his tweets expressed despair over the state of affairs. This story was carried by news outlets large and small, with ominous headlines about phishing attacks disguised as Google Doc access emails. Google itself confirmed it was investigating¬†phishing attempts last night: Twitter was full of messages from people who received such messages. On the surface, it appears folks realized quickly that something wasn‚Äôt right with these links: Google acted quickly, announcing steps users could take if they had indeed clicked on the link: Wisniewski said it‚Äôs ultimately Google‚Äôs responsibility to stop these sorts of threats: Attacks on systems that are open for¬†anyone to sign up as a developer using OAuth have been vulnerable to this type of attack for a long time, and the onus is on Google to do a better job vetting application developers. This is no different than the abuse of the Google Play store by malware authors. There is very little individuals can do other than be forever suspicious about legitimate requests from services provided by Google, Twitter, Facebook and other online services that use OAuth with an un-vetted application developer program. Twitter‚Äôs users were attacked using these techniques a few years back. Unfortunately, Google has also¬†fallen victim to a similar attack vector. When users see official emails from Google and official login pages used in scams, this leads the goodwill Google has garnered from its users to be potentially damaged. All providers of OAuth have a responsibility to police the use of their platforms to stop users from being tricked through official requests from services like Google, Twitter and Facebook. We do suggest that users keep an eye on social media.¬†As the Google Doc ‚Äúphishing‚Äù attempt demonstrates, Twitter is a great early-warning system. There‚Äôs little doubt that the tweeted warnings saved people from being victimized. Is he for real? It remains to be seen if Pupov‚Äôs claims are genuine. An email we sent to his gmail account promptly bounced back, and we‚Äôre still waiting for him to respond to our questions via Twitter. One question we have: what was the exact purpose of his project? Other security experts, meanwhile, have pointed out that Pupov‚Äôs claims¬†have not yet been independently verified. According to Coventry University, he‚Äôs not registered as a student there: What to do? The question, after all this, is what users should do to protect themselves. If this were a cut-and-dry phishing attempt, our tips would be to: Be careful what you click. This one is painfully obvious, but users need a constant reminder. Check the address bar for the correct URL.¬†The address bar in your web browser uses a URL to find the website you are looking for. The web address usually starts with either HTTP or HTTPS, followed by the domain name. The real websites of banks and many others use a secure connection that encrypts web traffic, called SSL or HTTPS. If you are expecting a secure HTTPS website for your bank, for example, make sure you see a URL beginning with https://before entering your private information. Look for the padlock for¬†secure HTTPS websites.¬†A secure HTTPS website has a padlock icon to the left of the web address. Consider using two-factor authentication for more security.¬†When you try to log into¬†a website with two-factor authentication (2FA), there‚Äôs an extra layer of security to make sure it‚Äôs you signing into your account. Keep an eye on Twitter: As the Google Doc phishing attempt demonstrates, Twitter is a great early-warning system. There‚Äôs little doubt that the tweeted warnings saved people from being victimized. Since¬†the details around what happened remain confused, it doesn‚Äôt hurt to take additional steps. For example, if someone believes they may have inadvertently downloaded a sketchy app, they can go to¬†myaccount.google.com/permissions and revoke permissions for any apps they¬†don‚Äôt trust. Wisniewski added: Users should check the apps they have approved to access their accounts and remove anything that may be suspicious on all OAuth-based platforms. For Google it is under your Google account -> Sign-in & Security -> Connected apps & sites. On Twitter and Facebook it is Settings & Privacy -> Apps.

Not exactly‚Äù John says: May 4, 2017 at 1:06 pm The account Eugene Pupov on twitter was only created this month, with the first tweet being that stating it was a test. The original profile picture was associated with someone completely different, which is now not associated with the twitter profile. It is unlikely this was a test.

Reply Mahhn says: May 4, 2017 at 2:58 pm Do you think the tweets were to make people less responsive to cleaning up it‚Äôs dirty work? giving the impression it might be nondestructive Reply Bill Brenner says: May 4, 2017 at 3:01 pm That is certainly possible. Also possible is that this person was looking for attention. I doubt that, though.

I know it seems like all the facts are pointing skeptically at this new user posting the story, but the code itself (my team and I dove into it after I got caught up in it) seemed amateur, rushed, and didn‚Äôt actually do much at all with the power it held. Those facts seem to me to corroborate the student story. As for the student not being in their database ‚Äì would you admit to the world under your real name as a college student? I sincerely doubt it. Reply John says: May 5, 2017 at 9:50 pm If it were an evil person instead of a student, they have a huge number of contact lists now and a huge number of email addresses.

Android Pay v1.22 prepares Visual ID facial recognition based on Hands Free and reveals testing for Brazil, Trinidad & Tobago, and Canada [APK Teardown] Cody Toombs Follow View All Posts 2017/05/05 1:23pm PDTMay 5, 2017 37 Plus 1 on G+ 23 Share on Facebook 46 Share on Twitter Total Shares106 APK Teardown Applications Downloads News Article Contents 1 Teardown 1.1 New Currencies 1.2 Hands Free returns as Visual ID 1.3 Testing and error reporting tools 2 Download Android Pay may not have had a massive launch, or has it been as aggressively rolled out as Samsung Pay, but it is steadily setting up shop in more countries around the globe. If you don't happen to find yourself in one of the dozen countries that have either already seen a launch or at least have an official promise of one coming soon, you might be interested to know that Google has at least set its sights on a few other countries. Text in the latest update of the Android Pay app hints at four previously unannounced markets. There are also obvious signs Google is merging the recently closed Hands Free experiment into Android Pay and expanding it significantly. Teardown Disclaimer: Teardowns are based on evidence found inside of apks (Android's application package) and are necessarily speculative and usually based on incomplete information. It's possible that the guesses made here are totally and completely wrong. Even when predictions are correct, there is always a chance that plans could change or may be canceled entirely. Much like rumors, nothing is certain until it's officially announced and released. The features discussed below are probably not live yet, or may only be live for a small percentage of users. Unless stated otherwise, don't expect to see these features if you install the apk. New Currencies The evidence for this one comes in the form of a new list of currency codes. Most of them relate to countries where Android Pay is already active, or at least Google has already said it will be soon. However, four of them belong to countries that haven't been officially announced yet. The list of currencies includes: Brazilian Real Trinidad & Tobago Dollar Irish Pound Canadian Dollar Correction: Ireland was added in December 2016. I was using an incorrect source list that was missing the rollout to AIB, KBC, and Ulster Bank. Thanks,¬†Daniel Brierton and Ail√≠n √ì'S. Of course, a teardown already told us last year that Canada is on the list, but Google hasn't actually taken the plunge to publicly commit. The other three are new. Rumors have circulated about all of them, particularly Brazil, which has been more officially mentioned by companies involved with the rollout of NFC-based payment terminals. Nevertheless, there haven't been any official statements about expansion into these countries by Google. Currency Codes <string-array name="currency_code"> <item>Please make a selection</item> <item>USD</item> <item>GBP</item> <item>SGD</item> <item>AUD</item> <item>HKD</item> <item>BRL</item>¬† // Brazilian Real <item>TTD</item>¬† // Trinidad & Tobago Dollar <item>PLN</item> <item>IEP</item>¬† // Irish pound <item>CAD</item>¬† // Canadian Dollar <item>JPY</item> <item>NZD</item> <item>OTHER</item> </string-array> This list doesn't appear to actually serve a purpose for regular users. Rather, it appears to be a tool for testers that need to switch currencies while working with payment terminals. As such, I'm not so sure the list won't be removed in the future, but at least it gives us some insight into what's coming. Unfortunately, it also doesn't tell us when to expect a launch in these new locales. Naturally, we'll keep an eye out for new information as it becomes available. A quick note about currencies: I copied Google's names for the currency codes directly. It's possible the Android Pay developers don't actually mean for IEP to be the Irish Pound, but may be using it as a symbolic reference to the Euro when it's used in Ireland. That would make sense if there are different rules or tax laws at processing time. Hands Free returns as Visual ID Many people probably didn't pay much attention to the Hands Free trial Google launched in and around its home base last year. To summarize, it's basically a new way to complete an in-person transaction without using a phone or card. Actually, you still need your phone with you because it relies on the various technologies that make up location services (i.e. Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS); but Instead of tapping it to a payment terminal, customers say "I'll pay with Google" and give their initials to the cashier, then their identity is confirmed using a camera and Google's facial recognition technology. A couple of months ago, the pilot program for Hands Free was shuttered, but Google left it with a somewhat promising message that hinted it wasn't really dead. Now it's clear why the message was so upbeat: Google is rolling Hands Free into Android Pay. It appears the feature will be branded Visual ID. code <string name="handsfree_landing_text1">It‚Äôs as simple as snapping a picture</string> <string name="handsfree_landing_text2">A camera will recognize you at the register</string> <string name="handsfree_landing_text3">Your points will be applied automatically</string> <string name="handsfree_landing_title">Never miss out on points again</string> <string name="handsfree_landing_title1">One-time setup</string> <string name="handsfree_landing_title2">Works like magic</string> <string name="handsfree_landing_title3">Just pay &amp; go</string> <string name="handsfree_learn_more">Learn more about Visual ID</string> <string name="handsfree_setting_title">Visual ID</string> <string name="handsfree_skip_button_title">Skip</string> <string name="handsfree_turn_on_button">Turn on</string> <string name="handsfree_welcome_button">See how it works</string> <string name="handsfree_photo_setup_title">Snap a picture of yourself</string> <string name="handsfree_photo_setup_subtitle">This will help Android Pay recognize you at the register</string> <string name="handsfree_permissions_title">Visual ID uses location &amp; Bluetooth</string> <string name="handsfree_permissions_text">Make sure you have both turned on so that Android Pay can recognize you at the register</string> <string name="handsfree_photo_error_subtitle">Make sure the photo clearly shows your face with no one else in the frame</string> <string name="handsfree_photo_error_title">Let‚Äôs try that again</string> Google promises to keep privacy intact by never sharing your picture with the merchant and deleting any images taken by its cameras within the store. Obviously, that doesn't impact the store's own cameras. <string name="handsfree_consent_text_identity_text">Google creates and stores a face template based on the photo you save during setup. When you're at a participating store, Visual ID will automatically confirm your identity using facial recognition technology (your face template is compared to the image captured by the in-store Visual ID camera). Images captured by the in-store Visual ID camera can't be accessed by the store and are deleted shortly after they're captured. They‚Äôre not stored or saved.</string> Also worth noting is that this doesn't prevent customers from enjoying their loyalty cards. Google will also match stored membership cards with the merchant and automatically apply them when your identity is confirmed. code <string name="handsfree_consent_subtitle">Visual ID is a secure way to confirm your identity at participating stores, making it easier to do things like earn loyalty points and redeem rewards.</string> <string name="handsfree_loyalty_card_message">Visual ID is on and your loyalty points will be automatically applied at checkout</string> <string name="handsfree_setting_description">At participating stores, Android Pay will recognize you at the register and automatically apply your loyalty points</string> <string name="handsfree_loyalty_card_error_message">Your photo has not uploaded.

You can turn Visual ID off at any time by changing your Android Pay settings.</string> Visual ID will require a camera mounted at checkout locations in stores, which means it's probably not going to become a widespread feature anytime soon. However, if it can garner lower transaction fees from banks or offer unique benefits for stores where customers actually need truly hands-free purchasing ‚Äì picture Starbucks and other places where people often carry things in and out without having time to organize ‚Äì it may catch on in a few places pretty quickly. Testing and error reporting tools While it's not at all important to us as users, there were some other bits included with this release for use by testers. When issues arise during use, they can report the nature of the test and what issues came up. The "engagement type" lists the type of tests, including: Ninja Field Testing (I love this name), Smoke Testing, Country Launch Testing, and Other. I don't have much to say about the rest of it, but for those that are curious, take a look at the rest of the reporting options. code <string-array name="engagement_type"> <item>Please make a selection</item> <item>Ninja Field Testing</item> <item>Smoke Testing</item> <item>Country Launch Testing</item> <item>Other</item> </string-array> <string-array name="hiccup_type"> <item>Please make a selection</item> <item>Unexpected keyguard</item> <item>Repeated keyguard</item> <item>Multiple taps required</item> <item>No hiccups</item> <item>Other</item> </string-array> <string-array name="terminal_message"> <item>Please make a selection</item> <item>Approved</item> <item>Decline</item> <item>Insert card</item> <item>Present one card</item> <item>Card type not accepted</item> <item>Terminal froze/crashed</item> <item>Terminal restarted</item> <item>Other</item> </string-array> <string-array name="terminal_type"> <item>Please make a selection</item> <item>Veriphone vx 820</item> <item>Veriphone vx 520</item> <item>Other</item> </string-array> <string-array name="user_perceived_result"> <item>Please make a selection</item> <item>Success no problems</item> <item>Success with hiccups</item> <item>Failure</item> </string-array> Download The APK is signed by Google and upgrades your existing app. The cryptographic signature guarantees that the file is safe to install and was not tampered with in any way.

Here in Ireland we've used the Euro since 2002, why would they add support for a dead currency? And we've already got android pay anyway... Cody Toombs I searched Google for the currency code and copied what they had listed for IEP. Perhaps the Android Pay developers don't actually mean for it to be the Irish Pound, but just using it ass a symbolic reference to the Euro when it's used in Ireland. That would make sense if there are different rules or tax laws at processing time. Daniel Brierton Also, Android Pay is already available in Ireland with AIB and KBC. Ail√≠n √ì‚ÄôS And Ulster Bank too since the other day. Cody Toombs Thanks for the heads up to both you and @Popple3:disqus. I've updated the article to clarify that Ireland isn't new. Ail√≠n √ì‚ÄôS No worries Cody. I'm still truly confused about the references to Irish Punt though üòÇüòÖ ozone89 Meanwhile, I'm tied to BOI üò© Ail√≠n √ì‚ÄôS They'll launch with Samsung Pay in a month or so. I'm sure of it üòÇ Ail√≠n √ì‚ÄôS The reference to "Irish Pound" is bizarre. That currency which we called Punt (Irish for Pound) hasn't been in use since the early 2000s when we switched to ‚Ç¨, and anyway, we have had Android Pay since December 2016. Bizarre. Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà So, can I tape a picture of a rich person over my face, and use their credit card data and buy really expensive stuff? DavidW username checks out Matt If you steal their credit card and google account information....no. Assuming the person wouldn't ring you up if you were wearing a mask. Matt It seems like installing facial recognition cameras in stores is a lot more difficult than a screen that just shows them a picture of me. It's not like they don't know what I look like - they're looking right at me. mike shwilly News articles say that Android Pay will be launched in Russia on 16th May Cody Toombs Yeah, Russia and South Korea have been confirmed either by Google, partners, or other companies involved in the rollout. They're definitely happening this year, but the dates have always been a little sloppy. I think we'll see at least a half dozen other countries by the end of the year, and maybe more. The adoption rate has been picking up. newtonfb Still waiting for Paypal to be activated.... HUEHUE BR OMG BRAZIIIIIIIL Renan Oh my god, I think I've wet my pants when I saw Brazil getting Android Pay love. God please yes! Ail√≠n √ì‚ÄôS Are NFC/Contactless terminals and Contactless debit/credit cards common in Brazil? Renan Not at all :P At least not where I live... but, to be honest, I've never asked, because I can't use even Samsung Pay (which seems to be supported here) because my old S5 doesn't seems to support it (and I'm using Lineage OS, anyway). But having support will increase interest, which will make more and more terminals to support NFC/contactless and will make contactless cards more common (or at least I hope so) Ail√≠n √ì‚ÄôS Ah, that's good Samsung Pay is there, hopefully that is encouraging Contactless take up. I suppose maybe Brazil relies a lot on the old card swipe technology and hence Samsung Pay would be of great use? When you go to pay with card don't you ever see the Contactless symbol there? I know nothing about the Brazilian payments market hence my curiosity üòÇ Thalles Ferreira Look, don't know where Renan lives in Brazil, not telling he's wrong, we're the size of a continent... But in S√£o Paulo and Rio, contactless terminals are now very common, many of them with stickers of Samsung Pay or NFC symbol. About the bank technology, it's bizarre, but Brazil uses by a decade or more the chip technology that US struggles to implement now. Here it's one of the most technical‚Äãadvanced in financial market of the world (sorry about this sentence, my English ain't that good). But paying with cell phone is awkward for most people here... It looks like a Jetsons future lol. But there are banks taking the next step, removing physical use of banks (only auto terminals) or changing the old numeric password for biometrics, not only in the app but in the terminals too. If you have other questions, I'm glad to explain, as I love the theme lol Fernando Pena Actually, they are pretty common. Most credit card terminals in Brasil are NFC supported these days (those from CIELO, REDE etc), they usually have a symbol near the screen that indicates it's supported. But many people don't know that... I have friends that use NFC payments all the time, from banks like "Banco do Brasil". Fernando Pena I really hope Nubank is related to this Android Pay initiative in Brasil. They are promising this for quite some time (maybe a year by now) and I use their card A LOT.

(AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais, File) By Ethan Baron | ebaron@bayareanewsgroup.com | Bay Area News Group PUBLISHED: May 5, 2017 at 4:04 pm | UPDATED: May 5, 2017 at 6:02 pm MOUNTAIN VIEW ‚Äî In a move seen as a mark of maturity, Google‚Äôs YouTube will produce a lineup of new original content that will screen for free on phones, computers and TVs, re-positioning the streaming video website¬†as a new destination for consumers and advertisers. Talk show icon Ellen DeGeneres, musicians Katy Perry, Demi Lovato and Ludacris, and comedian Kevin Hart will star in YouTube-produced¬†series to go online later this year exclusively on the site mostly known for user-generated content, Google announced in a blog post. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre coming late to a party that Netflix and Amazon threw a few years ago and they want to show up with some impressive housewarming gifts,‚Äù said Forrester analyst James McQuivey.¬†‚ÄúIt signals that YouTube has grown up a little bit.‚Äù Google‚Äôs announcement comes¬†at a time when¬†it‚Äôs dealing with a widespread advertising pullout from YouTube over the pairing of ads with extremist content. ‚ÄúIt gives them a value proposition that, ‚ÄòWe can run your ads in content that is not only safe, but exclusive and¬†should therefore attract a bigger audience,'‚Äù said Gartner analyst Andrew Frank. Because consumers have done a ‚Äútremendous job‚Äù of watching¬†more and more shows, YouTube‚Äôs¬†seven new series won‚Äôt necessarily divert audience from cable and network TV in the short term, Frank said. But people are increasingly wanting to create their own viewing lineups to watch on their own schedules, he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not going to undermine the ratings on Thursday¬†night for NBC, but it is going to undermine the habit of watching television the old way, a habit that‚Äôs already under siege,‚Äù Frank said. ‚ÄúDown the line, it‚Äôs the habit change that‚Äôs the most disconcerting to television,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúGoogle wants to make sure it‚Äôs a must-have in the TV 2.0 world.‚Äù YouTube‚Äôs new shows aren‚Äôt Google‚Äôs first foray into original content.¬†For the past year or so, it‚Äôs offered ad-free YouTube Red, releasing 30 series and movies so far ‚Äî but at the cost of a $10-per-month subscription. The new shows announced Thursday will contain ads, but more important to Google will be the relationships the programming will help build between consumers¬†and YouTube and the Mountain View internet giant, McQuivey said. ‚ÄúThis is itself an advertisement for YouTube,‚Äù McQuivey said. ‚ÄúIf you wave a big flag, you attract people. It‚Äôs (also) getting people to think Google is the company that can solve all their problems.‚Äù While YouTube may be late on original programming, it already has a strong position among companies that stream content to TV sets via the internet, according to data from market-research firm comScore. As of December, Netflix led the way, reaching into three quarters of U.S. homes, but YouTube had penetrated 53 percent of households, with Amazon Video¬†getting into 33 percent and video-on-demand company Hulu into¬†17 percent. However, with Netflix and Amazon racking up a host of Emmy awards, and Hulu getting two Emmy nominations last year, YouTube, with its one technical Emmy from 2013,¬†now has a shot at¬†boosting its profile via¬†award-winning shows. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre not getting the incredible lift that comes from winning an Emmy, causing major celebrities to call you to see, ‚ÄòWhat could we do together?'‚Äù McQuivey said. YouTube‚Äôs new original content will include DeGeneres‚Äô ‚ÄúEllen‚Äôs Show Me More Show,‚Äù a twice-a-week series ‚Äúgiving fans behind-the-scenes access to some of the biggest stars and her favorite moments,‚Äù according to Google. Also on tap will be ‚ÄúWhat the Fit‚Äù with comedian Hart, who will ‚Äúteam up with celebrity friends and YouTube stars each week as they attempt to master a different trending, grueling and sometimes ridiculous workout routine.‚Äù In ‚ÄúThe Katy Perry Live Special,‚Äù the pop queen ‚Äúwill take you inside of her world, revealing the experiences and emotions she poured into her all-new soul-baring music on the eve of her highly anticipated album launch¬†‚Ä¶ Katy will break it all down in this album listen-along.‚Äù Hip-hop star Ludacris will host ‚ÄúBest.Cover.Ever.,‚Äù a talent competition ‚Äúwhere emerging talent from across the globe submit covers to YouTube to vie for the ultimate prize: an opportunity to perform a duet with a superstar artist.‚Äù Rounding out the programming will be¬†‚ÄúI Am: Demi Lovato,‚Äù plus ‚ÄúGood Mythical Morning‚Äù from YouTube comedy duo¬†Rhett & Link, and ‚ÄúThe Super Slow Show‚Äù featuring The Slow Mo Guys, whose¬†colorful slow-motion videos attract millions of views on YouTube.

LG G6 already down to $500 at T-Mobile, plus free Google Home and G Pad X tablet Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/03 11:16am PDTMay 3, 2017 29 Plus 1 on G+ 79 Share on Facebook 44 Share on Twitter Total Shares152 G6 LG News T-Mobile Just the other day we noticed that LG's¬†G6 was $600 at B&H, and now the month-old flagship is down to $500 at T-Mobile. The model T-Mobile is selling might not be the same version you can get from B&H, but, for those of you on the magenta carrier, it is $100 less and comes with a free G Pad X. You can even use it to take advantage of LG's current promo and pick up a Google Home. $500 for a phone, tablet, and Google Home¬†is a pretty sweet deal if the $800 GS8 and its curvy screen doesn't appeal to you. I hope these rapid drops in price aren't a sign of trouble for LG, but in the meantime, they do serve consumers pretty well. The G6 was well regarded in our review. We found the screen to be a pretty great IPS panel if that's your preference. Battery life was also decent, and the size and feel of the phone both struck us well. If you're interested in trying out the future of flagship aspect ratios and rounded screens, the G6 is a decent way to go. The promotion for a free Google Home ($114 right now) sweetens the deal pretty well, too. All these¬†offers have a couple of small caveats you should keep in mind if you're interested in picking up a free Google Home and G Pad X with your G6. For the Google Home you have to order your phone by May 7th, which is just a few days away, and you have to submit your registration for the promo online by the 22nd. The G Pad X requires that you hold a plan through T-Mobile with at least 2GB of data, and keep your service for 24 months. The precise terms and conditions are available at the links below.

Marty Not for a 32GB one these days. A flagship with last gen SoC, no quad DAC and the smallest memory. Simon Are you concerned by this? I'm not sure since you made only 3 comments in 3 minutes about it. Marty Yeah, I don't sound too concerned. But it's a concern. üòâ needa Making my third in three minutes here so you can see my concern also. needa $500 is the right price with those specs. Home is the bonus. Marty Get a Oneplus 3T. 128GB and SD821. Plus it has 6GB RAM. Mine works beautifully. And it's gorgeous. All for $480. needa Yeah but still have the screen and the cameras. I'd buy the 3T in a heartbeat over this. But I don't care that much about the 128. Most I ever had on my 64 OPO over the three years was thirty'ish. Deleted ten gb in roms and was back in action. Mike Not waterproof, much worse camera, update support is a giant question mark, screen is lower quality. One is a true flagship the other is a mid ranger and it shows. Marty What's wrong with the display? Mine's already updated to 7.1.1. And there's a plethora of software options in Beta. And the camera makes beatiful pics. It loads as fast as any Samsung camera. Mike If you're going to talk about current flagship specs, a screen from flagships released, what, two or three years ago doesn't make sense. Also, the OnePlus 2/X still hasn't seen Nougat, OnePlus has yet to prove they can continue with support for older devices. Marty Perfectly fine and beautiful display. It looks better than the display in my Nexus 6P. Bob Marley Except it's not. The pixel density on the OP3T display is effectively the same as the iPhone 7 due to the Pentile subpixel layout. If you have even average vision, the lack of sharpness is apparent, especially on text. Marty It looks gorgeous to me. And quantity isnt quality. needa The OPO ended with the November 2016 security patch. That is all of your fingers and toes, in months, plus a few more. They are lagging behind with the 2/x... no doubt. But they have proven support for older devices. More than some other mainstream OEMs. And with that... I have exceeded my maximum number of comments on a page by about six. See yall later. P. Sherman Sony released Nougat to Xperia Z5 and Z3+. They were released around the same time OnePlus 2 was released. Their attitude to OnePlus 2 and their users is beyond pathetic. needa Not denying they aren't behind. And not denying that they should throw the OP2 users a bone. But you can't use one example and generalize the company. Every single OEM has had their flagship that didn't get updated at a reasonable rate, or updated at all. "The beta test is over". needa hmm. ATT s6 just now getting nougat. I know I know. Oneplus is the worst. They released a new phone only few months after the s6 was released... and It DOesn't HAVe NOUGat YET? Omg. The travesty. Samsung must have been cracking the whip on their 'small team' of developers. tl;dr. It will all be ok. Life will go on. Marty Ohh...by the way, my G5 is on Android 6.0.1 with no sign of any future update. My G4 is on Android 6 and also with no sign of any future update. I'd say LG is worse than any of them for updates. YaKillaCJ You sound dense to me. OnePlus has a amoled display. Nor has LG when it comes to updates.OnePlus however has learned big time from their mistakes, openly said it and proving it. Another huge benefit is being completely open source, which means the OnePlus 3 will be running Android Q due to community support. Much how OnePlus One is running Nougat, released with KitKat. Mike Just having an "Amoled display" doesn't mean that the display is good and I was more referencing the fact that it's a 1080p panel when Marty was talking about phones using last years specs. Being Open Source is a benefit to a select few, the majority of the Android world isn't going to know what a ROM is and on the official channel, none of OnePlus' devices before the 3 have Nougat yet. I'm not saying LG is any better with updates but you can't overlook OnePlus' past with updates when looking to buy one of their phones. YaKillaCJ Yes maybe not better but neither is "better" and this is very much user preference. Me for example, I prefer Amoled and 1080p because battery life. Open source isn't a factor to the average person but it's definitely a big benefit to have in your back pocket as they say. As far as past, this works against LG. They have released probably 100 headsets over the years, only 10 gets half decent support. Vs OnePlus who released 5 devices and 3 of which has gotten better support than all of LG offerings. Both have their hardware controversy, as do every OEM. OnePlus open thrives to do better. While LG sticks the head in the sand until they getting a class action lawsuit. Every Flagship since LG-G4 will "eventually" bootloop apparently. needa But the majority of the peeps owning an OP2 had to get an invite first. OnePlus owners cannot be lumped into "the majority of the Android world". Not yet at least. needa 1080 vs 2k isn't about the quality. The 3T has a killer screen. Can't say anything about their support as the OPO that I finally sat down two days ago is still working as good as the day I got it. Just a bit long in the tooth. ie. three years of charging and hindered by the tech back then. Marty Thank you. Exactly. Resolution isn't a factor in quality just like MPs are a factor in picture quality. Leticiacmadrigal Google is paying 97$ per hour!

It's the best mid ranger around but if you can spend the extra $100 or $200 you will get a much better phone. But of course, people spend money on their phones so they will do everything in their power to convince themselves it is a perfect device so me spitting out facts is basically like banging my head against a wall. Oh, and I own neither device, I've held and used both but don't have a horse in either race. southerndinner Terrible support, never gets updated, incredibly unethical company, no IP rating and poor screen quality. I don't care much for LG but this is a way better deal than the 3T Marty What about my LG G4 and G5 that never get updated? My Oneplus 3T is on Android 7.1.1. The display is gorgeous and better looking than the display in my Nexus 6P. But let me guess, you're one of those people who equates screen quality with pixel resolution? If so, you probably determine a camera's quality based on its pixel count. Mike The 3T screen uses a resolution from flagships phones released in 2013. You mention that the CPU in the G6 is basically worthless since it's from last year but completely overlook other specs the phone has from years ago. Way to only grab the specs that back up your side, while blatantly ignoring others. Marty LG had a choice. If they chose to run with a last gen SoC they could have compensated for it by stuffing the G6 with a bunch of goodies like extra large storage and the quad DAC. But they didn't. There's nothing wrong with the SD821, but it is last gen. The 3T uses the SD821 but has quadruple the storage size for less cost than the G6 at a discount. Mike Storage size means so little these days with expandable storage being a thing. Unless you are downloading twenty 1 GB apps, you'll be fine. Some people may need more but the vast majority don't after buying a $20 64 GB SD card. The G6 is slightly more expensive but offers real world improvements such as a better main shooter, a wide angle shooter, and waterproofing over the OnePlus. So they chose to make the phone more usable over adding a better DAC that most of the US probably could care less about and if they do will go with the similarly priced V20. Either way, the 3T seems like a loss unless you are on a strict budget or don't care about mobile photography. Marty No, expandable storage sucks super bad for using as app storage. Theres a lot of disadvantage to it. It's fine for pictures, videos, music etc, though, but it isn't the same as internal storage. You're not considering the fact that the user doesn't get 32GB of actual internal storage on a 32GB device. The system takes up a considerable amount of that 32GB. And I know all too well how bad it feels not having ample space for apps and various media related projects on my devices. I love having 100GB of free user storage on my 3T. I can install app and games to my heart's desire without fretting of running out of space. Mike The phone doesn't work for you (As you've stated many times), we get it, the S7/Edge was one of the best selling phones with only 32 GB of storage last year so I don't think the general public cares nor sees it as a selling point. LG went with the majority of people looking to buy their phones not the one person online looking to install every trending app on their phone. Marty Yeah, okay. Say hi to LG for us all as they continue to languish and remain in Samsung's shadow...lol. I really hope for LG's sake you aren't any kind of decision maker for them. They'd do well to can your a ss. üòâ Mike As I said previously, I have no horse in this race. I've owned LG, Samsung, Nexii, and HTC devices and every time I go to purchase a phone I look at the landscape and go from there. Your original argument was that the OnePlus 3T was a vastly better buy than the G6. My reasoning is that (In my opinion) you get better real world features in the G6 over the OnePlus that's all. Sorry I bothered you so much. Marty I don't know where you get "vastly" from, certainly not me. But the 3T, from what I'm experiencing with it, it is definitely a better buy than the G6. I own a G5 that can't compete with the 3T. My G4 and G5 both exhibit lag and sluggishness in various ways whereas my 3T is snappy and quick. Both of my LGs act like they really don't want to get out of bed when I tap to wake them up. My 3T acts like it's raring and ready to go when I tap to wake it up. In fact, out of all the devices I own...a substantial bunch...only my LGs are sluggish about waking up. Marty And by the way, the rest of what you said sounds arrogant as all h ell. You seem to be speaking for all US users. You know what? F *ck LG. They've seen the last penny from this US user. You're arrogant attitude promoted me saying that. Mike Sorry you feel that way, I don't care what phone you buy to be honest. If by bundling the US into one segment makes me sound arrogant then so be it, but when you release one phone a year you have to go with the majority of what your users will be looking for and manage cost with that as well which is why we've never seen a perfect phone, even the S8 this year has some major flaws. On the flip side, if that's your dog in your thumbnail, it's cute as all hell. ¬Ø_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø Marty Hey, it's no skin off my hide that LG keeps making stupid decisions year after year. They are one of the most leading smartphone makers...umm...wait... I, as a user, have much better alternatives to consider. Mike LG's stock has soared since the G6 was announced, going up 15% between the announcement and now. I guess the public likes stupid decisions. Marty Too early to tell. Give it a fiscal quarter and then make a comment. min009 So, how's beta testing for OnePlus working out? I did it with their first 2 phones. Took several months to get a stable rom after launch. Not again. Marty Don't know. I haven't indulged in the Beta testing. I'm actually fully content with how my 3T works with stock firmware. It is, though, an intriguing proposition to consider for when the device gets old and becomes secondary to newer ones. It'll be fun to play with either on Beta or custom ROMs. Jasdeep Singh The S8 effect. LG remains under Samsung's shadow! Marty Because LG makes stupid decisions. Snubbing the American market isn't wise. New_Guy Not to mention they squandered their chance to take over Android the market by constantly putting sub-par cameras in the M-line (4 Ultra Pixels......c'mon man). The only reason I got the Moto X 2014 over the M8 was because of the camera. needa Definitely the new guy. HTC New_Guy Yeah, I was trippin' there for a second....been a long g day already. needa Lol. I hear yah. I have done the same thing before. New_Guy I'd delete the comment, but whatevs.... ¬Ø_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø Matthew Scott Smith I didn't see a mention of HTC in the above comments, but HTC is doing much worse than LG presently. New_Guy Yeah, I sort of lost myself there for a moment...been a long day, haha ASYOUTHIA‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà The S8 trumps the G6. Sammy got LG running like a scalded dog illregal Trumps it in what.. Not in usability, software smoothness, or camera. Tom Ireland http://www.greenbot.com/article/3194527/android/samsung-sweetens-galaxy-s8-purchases-with-6-months-of-netflix-other-goodies.html#tk.rss_all BC LG will eternally be the second and sometimes third best, as their poor choices are constantly going to make their phones less appealing. The gimped USA version had been a nonstarter to me, Smartworld is a POS...I didn't want to deal with that after the LG V20, which even after a factory reset started to become janky. I just wish LG would step up their game and become competition to Samsung. LG needs to freshen up their Android Skin, continue to work on their features and software. BigDeeNY99 exactly why i dont rush anymore to purchase the new next best phone.. Eric Vaughan Also comes with the LG G Pad X 8.0? Seems like a good deal. Marty LG disgusts me. Always skimping for the US market. 32GB max and no quad DAC. illregal Korea gets a 6gb ram 128gb S8. But just completely ignore that.. Marty No, Samsung snubs us too. Especially with updates. Buy a non carrier branded US market Samsung phone and forget about updates. Buy an international version and get updates, but no Samsung Pay. If you want updates and SP you have to invest in a carrier locked version. Screw Samsung. I'm going Oneplus, Huawei, ZTE and other Chinese brands...or Apple. balthazar The model T-Mobile is selling might not be the same version you can get from B&H[...] What are the differences? Ryne Hager T-Mobile has a more limited set of frequencies listed for their model, and B&H has the unlocked model that supports a pretty broad range. I can't be sure that the T-Mobile version is locked or unlocked or supports any frequencies outside what T-Mobile lists. Justin W Usually T-Mobile locks their network support. You can temporarily unlock, or permanent unlock, but that depends on your standing with the company. Well, unless this time around is different - the V20 I just picked up has those stipulations in place. Rod Flop much? Sohit will this work on Verizon? Margaritas Ante Porcos Great deal indeed. Although even in my medieval country g6 goes for around $600 bucks. Samsungs will drop s8 prices soon. Only few crazy nerds are buying those phones for 800. Suicide_Note A few thousand buy LG's wares, while millions have already bought the S8/S8+, and I'm sure they're not all 'nerds' as you put it. MRIANB Wow, LG is desperate and phone must not be selling against S8. Ryan Bartz Aside from the iPhone no phone can compete with Samsung. Samsung releases a respectable phone with half backed software (nothing has changed) and people forget about LG which is a damn good no gimmick phone Tom Ireland I guess Samsung has another reason for more goodies? http://www.greenbot.com/article/3194527/android/samsung-sweetens-galaxy-s8-purchases-with-6-months-of-netflix-other-goodies.html#tk.rss_all I think you could take a differing position on any add-ons a company offers. Martin Watched couple videos on YouTube and the phone is pretty damn good. And this deal is pretty sweet. Wish I was in US... Here butt naked G6 is $650.... :) TechGuy22 299 and i'd buy it Marty Same for me. At that price point, not having the quad DAC and the small memory doesn't hurt too bad. sebastianer If they are powered with random bootlooping technology‚Ä¶ I'm totally in. Arysyn While I'm not a fan of the LG G6, this isn't a bad price, especially for what is included. It would be an even better deal if priced to go against the ZTE Axon 7, as the G6 still is a much better device, despite the features I think LG ought to have included in the G6. JD At this rate you might as well just get right to where the G6 will end up. You get a free boot-looping G6 with the purchase of every Google Home. Mike The Galaxy S8 forced the markdown J_Grouchy The "free" tablet ($240 value) requires a $10/month data plan for 24 months. Funny how that math works... Mike in KC Now throw in a BOGO deal on top of that price and I'm in. southerndinner LOL in the bargain bin already RIP LG Mobile PhillipeFelut the V20 and G6 are 50% off on at&t next as well fyi DroidBlaze I'm still liking my s7e but if the US g6 had 64gb and the quad dac I would have seriously considered getting it. As is, the US g6 is just meh. calvini Just got the G6 from AT&T for $360 with the free tablet and I also had the option of getting the LG Smart watch for $50. Registered on LGs website to get the free Google home as well. I believe this promo lasts this whole month, but to be eligible for the Google home, you need to purchase the phone before the 7th of May. Not a bad deal at all through AT&T. Edit: must sign up for "Next" payments. 30 months @ $12 or 24 months @ $15 illregal Everyone talking like they are scared of the S8.. No, not at all. They are scared of what HTC is about to unleash. The real flagship phone for 2017. steadymobb Bahahaha. Damn I was already in a good mood because it's Friday but this gave me a good laugh. Thanks!

Android Pay v1.22 prepares Visual ID facial recognition based on Hands Free and reveals testing for Brazil, Trinidad & Tobago, and Canada [APK Teardown] Cody Toombs Follow View All Posts 2017/05/05 1:23pm PDTMay 5, 2017 37 Plus 1 on G+ 23 Share on Facebook 46 Share on Twitter Total Shares106 APK Teardown Applications Downloads News Article Contents 1 Teardown 1.1 New Currencies 1.2 Hands Free returns as Visual ID 1.3 Testing and error reporting tools 2 Download Android Pay may not have had a massive launch, or has it been as aggressively rolled out as Samsung Pay, but it is steadily setting up shop in more countries around the globe. If you don't happen to find yourself in one of the dozen countries that have either already seen a launch or at least have an official promise of one coming soon, you might be interested to know that Google has at least set its sights on a few other countries. Text in the latest update of the Android Pay app hints at four previously unannounced markets. There are also obvious signs Google is merging the recently closed Hands Free experiment into Android Pay and expanding it significantly. Teardown Disclaimer: Teardowns are based on evidence found inside of apks (Android's application package) and are necessarily speculative and usually based on incomplete information. It's possible that the guesses made here are totally and completely wrong. Even when predictions are correct, there is always a chance that plans could change or may be canceled entirely. Much like rumors, nothing is certain until it's officially announced and released. The features discussed below are probably not live yet, or may only be live for a small percentage of users. Unless stated otherwise, don't expect to see these features if you install the apk. New Currencies The evidence for this one comes in the form of a new list of currency codes. Most of them relate to countries where Android Pay is already active, or at least Google has already said it will be soon. However, four of them belong to countries that haven't been officially announced yet. The list of currencies includes: Brazilian Real Trinidad & Tobago Dollar Irish Pound Canadian Dollar Correction: Ireland was added in December 2016. I was using an incorrect source list that was missing the rollout to AIB, KBC, and Ulster Bank. Thanks,¬†Daniel Brierton and Ail√≠n √ì'S. Of course, a teardown already told us last year that Canada is on the list, but Google hasn't actually taken the plunge to publicly commit. The other three are new. Rumors have circulated about all of them, particularly Brazil, which has been more officially mentioned by companies involved with the rollout of NFC-based payment terminals. Nevertheless, there haven't been any official statements about expansion into these countries by Google. Currency Codes <string-array name="currency_code"> <item>Please make a selection</item> <item>USD</item> <item>GBP</item> <item>SGD</item> <item>AUD</item> <item>HKD</item> <item>BRL</item>¬† // Brazilian Real <item>TTD</item>¬† // Trinidad & Tobago Dollar <item>PLN</item> <item>IEP</item>¬† // Irish pound <item>CAD</item>¬† // Canadian Dollar <item>JPY</item> <item>NZD</item> <item>OTHER</item> </string-array> This list doesn't appear to actually serve a purpose for regular users. Rather, it appears to be a tool for testers that need to switch currencies while working with payment terminals. As such, I'm not so sure the list won't be removed in the future, but at least it gives us some insight into what's coming. Unfortunately, it also doesn't tell us when to expect a launch in these new locales. Naturally, we'll keep an eye out for new information as it becomes available. A quick note about currencies: I copied Google's names for the currency codes directly. It's possible the Android Pay developers don't actually mean for IEP to be the Irish Pound, but may be using it as a symbolic reference to the Euro when it's used in Ireland. That would make sense if there are different rules or tax laws at processing time. Hands Free returns as Visual ID Many people probably didn't pay much attention to the Hands Free trial Google launched in and around its home base last year. To summarize, it's basically a new way to complete an in-person transaction without using a phone or card. Actually, you still need your phone with you because it relies on the various technologies that make up location services (i.e. Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS); but Instead of tapping it to a payment terminal, customers say "I'll pay with Google" and give their initials to the cashier, then their identity is confirmed using a camera and Google's facial recognition technology. A couple of months ago, the pilot program for Hands Free was shuttered, but Google left it with a somewhat promising message that hinted it wasn't really dead. Now it's clear why the message was so upbeat: Google is rolling Hands Free into Android Pay. It appears the feature will be branded Visual ID. code <string name="handsfree_landing_text1">It‚Äôs as simple as snapping a picture</string> <string name="handsfree_landing_text2">A camera will recognize you at the register</string> <string name="handsfree_landing_text3">Your points will be applied automatically</string> <string name="handsfree_landing_title">Never miss out on points again</string> <string name="handsfree_landing_title1">One-time setup</string> <string name="handsfree_landing_title2">Works like magic</string> <string name="handsfree_landing_title3">Just pay &amp; go</string> <string name="handsfree_learn_more">Learn more about Visual ID</string> <string name="handsfree_setting_title">Visual ID</string> <string name="handsfree_skip_button_title">Skip</string> <string name="handsfree_turn_on_button">Turn on</string> <string name="handsfree_welcome_button">See how it works</string> <string name="handsfree_photo_setup_title">Snap a picture of yourself</string> <string name="handsfree_photo_setup_subtitle">This will help Android Pay recognize you at the register</string> <string name="handsfree_permissions_title">Visual ID uses location &amp; Bluetooth</string> <string name="handsfree_permissions_text">Make sure you have both turned on so that Android Pay can recognize you at the register</string> <string name="handsfree_photo_error_subtitle">Make sure the photo clearly shows your face with no one else in the frame</string> <string name="handsfree_photo_error_title">Let‚Äôs try that again</string> Google promises to keep privacy intact by never sharing your picture with the merchant and deleting any images taken by its cameras within the store.

They‚Äôre not stored or saved.</string> Also worth noting is that this doesn't prevent customers from enjoying their loyalty cards.

However, if it can garner lower transaction fees from banks or offer unique benefits for stores where customers actually need truly hands-free purchasing ‚Äì picture Starbucks and other places where people often carry things in and out without having time to organize ‚Äì it may catch on in a few places pretty quickly. Testing and error reporting tools While it's not at all important to us as users, there were some other bits included with this release for use by testers. When issues arise during use, they can report the nature of the test and what issues came up. The "engagement type" lists the type of tests, including: Ninja Field Testing (I love this name), Smoke Testing, Country Launch Testing, and Other.

Here in Ireland we've used the Euro since 2002, why would they add support for a dead currency? And we've already got android pay anyway... Cody Toombs I searched Google for the currency code and copied what they had listed for IEP. Perhaps the Android Pay developers don't actually mean for it to be the Irish Pound, but just using it ass a symbolic reference to the Euro when it's used in Ireland. That would make sense if there are different rules or tax laws at processing time. Daniel Brierton Also, Android Pay is already available in Ireland with AIB and KBC. Ail√≠n √ì‚ÄôS And Ulster Bank too since the other day. Cody Toombs Thanks for the heads up to both you and @Popple3:disqus. I've updated the article to clarify that Ireland isn't new. Ail√≠n √ì‚ÄôS No worries Cody. I'm still truly confused about the references to Irish Punt though üòÇüòÖ ozone89 Meanwhile, I'm tied to BOI üò© Ail√≠n √ì‚ÄôS They'll launch with Samsung Pay in a month or so. I'm sure of it üòÇ Ail√≠n √ì‚ÄôS The reference to "Irish Pound" is bizarre. That currency which we called Punt (Irish for Pound) hasn't been in use since the early 2000s when we switched to ‚Ç¨, and anyway, we have had Android Pay since December 2016. Bizarre. Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà So, can I tape a picture of a rich person over my face, and use their credit card data and buy really expensive stuff? DavidW username checks out Matt If you steal their credit card and google account information....no. Assuming the person wouldn't ring you up if you were wearing a mask. Matt It seems like installing facial recognition cameras in stores is a lot more difficult than a screen that just shows them a picture of me. It's not like they don't know what I look like - they're looking right at me. mike shwilly News articles say that Android Pay will be launched in Russia on 16th May Cody Toombs Yeah, Russia and South Korea have been confirmed either by Google, partners, or other companies involved in the rollout. They're definitely happening this year, but the dates have always been a little sloppy. I think we'll see at least a half dozen other countries by the end of the year, and maybe more. The adoption rate has been picking up. newtonfb Still waiting for Paypal to be activated.... HUEHUE BR OMG BRAZIIIIIIIL Renan Oh my god, I think I've wet my pants when I saw Brazil getting Android Pay love. God please yes! Ail√≠n √ì‚ÄôS Are NFC/Contactless terminals and Contactless debit/credit cards common in Brazil? Renan Not at all :P At least not where I live... but, to be honest, I've never asked, because I can't use even Samsung Pay (which seems to be supported here) because my old S5 doesn't seems to support it (and I'm using Lineage OS, anyway). But having support will increase interest, which will make more and more terminals to support NFC/contactless and will make contactless cards more common (or at least I hope so) Ail√≠n √ì‚ÄôS Ah, that's good Samsung Pay is there, hopefully that is encouraging Contactless take up. I suppose maybe Brazil relies a lot on the old card swipe technology and hence Samsung Pay would be of great use? When you go to pay with card don't you ever see the Contactless symbol there? I know nothing about the Brazilian payments market hence my curiosity üòÇ Thalles Ferreira Look, don't know where Renan lives in Brazil, not telling he's wrong, we're the size of a continent... But in S√£o Paulo and Rio, contactless terminals are now very common, many of them with stickers of Samsung Pay or NFC symbol. About the bank technology, it's bizarre, but Brazil uses by a decade or more the chip technology that US struggles to implement now. Here it's one of the most technical‚Äãadvanced in financial market of the world (sorry about this sentence, my English ain't that good). But paying with cell phone is awkward for most people here... It looks like a Jetsons future lol. But there are banks taking the next step, removing physical use of banks (only auto terminals) or changing the old numeric password for biometrics, not only in the app but in the terminals too. If you have other questions, I'm glad to explain, as I love the theme lol Fernando Pena Actually, they are pretty common. Most credit card terminals in Brasil are NFC supported these days (those from CIELO, REDE etc), they usually have a symbol near the screen that indicates it's supported. But many people don't know that... I have friends that use NFC payments all the time, from banks like "Banco do Brasil". Fernando Pena I really hope Nubank is related to this Android Pay initiative in Brasil. They are promising this for quite some time (maybe a year by now) and I use their card A LOT.

After several years of service, the Google Play Top Developer program is being put to rest Jordan Palmer Follow View All Posts 2017/05/05 3:20pm PDTMay 5, 2017 15 Plus 1 on G+ 23 Share on Facebook 43 Share on Twitter Total Shares81 Google News The Top Developers program launched several years ago¬†as a method of drawing attention to devs who put out great apps. We all started seeing the little blue arrow badge next to some of the developers' names, but it got easy to grow accustomed and eventually jaded to it.¬† The time has come, it seems, to say goodbye to the program. Google has sent out an email to some developers discussing the eclipse of the Top Developers badge and system, but there's also a promise of something new on the horizon. The Play Store's app recognition methodology¬†will soon have more of a focus on individual apps and games that are worth noting, instead of an entire dev account. Here's the email: "The Google Play Top Developer program was created to recognize partners who developed top quality Android apps and games Every day developers like you are hard at work creating apps and games on Android. Whether you‚Äôre updating an existing app or building something new, we‚Äôve seen an incredible increase in the level of polish and quality in so many fun, entertaining, and useful apps. We want to make sure more people find the great experiences you are creating. The Google Play Top Developer program launched many years ago to recognize developers who created high quality Android apps and games. We conducted research, with both developers and consumers, and observed a clear value and preference for the recognition of individual apps and games, instead of entire organizations. After taking a look at our existing app recognition programs, the Google Play editorial team has decided to focus its efforts on recognizing high quality and innovative apps and games. As a first step, we will be closing the Top Developer program and removing the badging from the Play Store within 30 days. We have exciting plans to recognize more of the great apps and games you create and will be sharing updates soon. We thank you for your continued commitment to Android and Google Play." It's hard to say that this is a bad thing.¬†It will be interesting to see what Google has up its sleeve for the future of app recognition in the Play Store.

Artem Russakovskii The top developer badge stopped being meaningful to me when I saw it given out to developers with lots of bought users, reviews, tons of IAPs, etc. What I'd much rather see is a verified check mark similar to Twitter, Facebook, and G+ so people can be assured they're looking at the right dev account and not a copycat.

Voice assistants such as Google Home, Apple‚Äôs Siri and Amazon Alexa have always been susceptible to accidental hijack. Burger King‚Äôs manipulation of Google Home illustrates the vulnerabilities intrinsic to voice assistants that can be targeted by brands, or worse, hackers. But the stunt might help speed up the next developments for home voice assistants: individual voice recognition and even image recognition. FILE ‚Äì In this March 2, 2016, file photo, David Limp, Amazon Senior Vice President of Devices, pushes down on an Echo Dot in San Francisco. Voice assistants such as Google Home, Apple√æ√Ñ√¥s Siri and Amazon Alexa have always been susceptible to accidental hijack. In January 2017, a woman‚Äôs 6-year old daughter ordered a dollhouse and sugar cookies simply by asking Alexa for them through an Echo Dot. Since these devices are still new, they‚Äôre still having growing pains. But the next generation of voice assistants may come with better security, including individual voice recognition and even image recognition. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File) NEW YORK Burger King pulled a pretty juicy marketing stunt last month that drew plenty of attention ‚Äì not just to the Whopper, but also to the intrinsic vulnerabilities of a new type of voice-activated gadget. The fast food chain‚Äôs 15-second television ad targeted Google Home, a speaker that can answer questions and control other smart appliances. When an actor in the ad said ‚ÄúOK, Google‚Äù and asked a question about the Whopper, Google Home obediently began reading the burger‚Äôs ingredients in homes around the country ‚Äì effectively extending the commercial for however long it took someone to shout ‚ÄúOK, Google, stop!‚Äù Google and Wikipedia quickly made fixes to shut it down. Though annoying, the stunt may have done some good by highlighting how easy it is to hijack such devices. (Just imagine a burglar spying a voice assistant and asking it to unlock all the doors.) It could also speed the development of home voice assistants with better security. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a wakeup call,‚Äù said Earl Perkins, a digital security analyst at the research firm Gartner. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a harbinger of things to come.‚Äù Voice assistants such as Google Home, Apple‚Äôs Siri and Amazon‚Äôs Echo devices have always been susceptible to accidental hijack. A Google ad during the Super Bowl that used the phrase ‚ÄúOK, Google‚Äù reportedly set off people‚Äôs devices. And in a January story that briefly turned a family into media celebrities, a woman‚Äôs 6-year old daughter ordered a dollhouse and sugar cookies simply by asking Amazon‚Äôs voice assistant Alexa for them. Since the devices are so new ‚Äì the Amazon Echo debuted in 2015, Google Home last year ‚Äì they‚Äôre still having growing pains. And they‚Äôre growing in popularity; Consumer Intelligence Research Partners estimates that Amazon sold 3 million Echo devices in the U.S. in the fourth quarter of 2016, bringing the total to more than 8 million. Amazon doesn‚Äôt release sales figures. Many experts believe that deliberate attempts to trigger voice assistants will be short-lived. Among other things, brands have to face the consequences of potentially annoying millions of people. ‚ÄúBurger King was doing what the Burger King brand is known to do, stir controversy and make sure it gets lots of coverage,‚Äù Forrester principal analyst James McQuivey said. ‚ÄúVery few brands want to do that.‚Äù Of course, spammers and other bottom-feeding marketers can still try to implement the technique. But voice assistants already have a few ways to block them. Amazon already makes sure its TV commercials and those of its partners can‚Äôt inadvertently trigger the speaker. Developers that provide Echo with ‚Äúskills‚Äù that let it, for instance, order pizza, are also prohibited from creating Alexa commands that would trigger ads. Google says it also has techniques to block TV ads from activating Google Home. Neither company provided details on those techniques. Voice assistants are still in their ‚Äúvery early days,‚Äù Google says; the company plans to ‚Äúmonitor and learn as we go.‚Äù Hackers might also be a threat. But because voice assistants are so new and limited in scope, more established connected devices such as webcams, routers and printers pose more of a threat for now. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not that we won‚Äôt see some creative or unique instance (of hacking), but I don‚Äôt think this is going to be the next great wave of cybercrime,‚Äù said Steve Grobman, chief technology officer at the security company McAfee. But before long, the devices are going to need better security. ‚ÄúWhen you move into a world of voice, some of the rules that we‚Äôre accustomed to, related to security for computers, change,‚Äù Gartner‚Äôs Perkins said. Exactly how that works could depend on exactly what task a voice assistant is performing. Asking about the weather requires less security than say, shopping or accessing a bank account. Amazon already has options for setting up security codes to shop, make financial transactions or unlock and start cars. Of course, someone could always overhear you reciting a security phrase. A better solution, and one that companies are hard at work on, would be to identify a person‚Äôs voice, much the way Google and Facebook identify faces today. Beyond improving security, that technology could help the device personalize recommendations or even ads for the individual, not the whole family. Apple already lets users voice-train its Siri digital assistant so it‚Äôs more likely to activate only when it hears a specific voice. Amazon has a voice training option for Alexa. Google Home can recognize up to six different voices, though it won‚Äôt prevent unauthorized users from activating the assistant. You need to be Logged in to sign up for Express Login. Experts suggest that companies will eventually add cameras to voice assistants. Amazon‚Äôs new Echo Look has a camera, but it‚Äôs for offering fashion advice. Combining a facial scan with voice recognition would definitely beef up security, although they‚Äôll also create new privacy concerns. ‚ÄúWithout any security or minimal security, (voice assistants are) going to be a fat target,‚Äù Perkins said. ‚ÄúThere will be all kinds of innovation associated with compromising these systems.‚Äù Share this: Facebook Twitter Google WhatsApp Pinterest Reddit Tumblr More Skype LinkedIn Pocket Email Print Telegram Related Leave a Reply Cancel reply You must be logged in to post a comment.

Earlier this year, the app version got more service providers and full Uber service integration. The service added wheelchair-friendly information, parking difficulty icon for 25 metro areas in the US, real-time information, and even local reviews in your default language. The tech giant will not stop improving the web feature because it provides a lot of information to all the users. Google Maps isn‚Äôt just a collection of maps from all over the world. It has become a useful tool for everyone. It‚Äôs not yet perfect but it is generally reliable. The company aims to deliver more accurate and timely information so it is adding more data. One of the many steps is to find a way on how to extract data automatically from billions of images collected by Street View cars. It sounds impossible but Google has already started with the work. The Google Ground Truth team has began its ‚ÄòAttention-based Extraction of Structured Information from Street View Imagery‚Äô project with the aim of extracting street names, numbers, and businesses. This will hopefully keep Maps up-to-date all the time. Google is now turning to deep neural networks for this automation. The algorithm should be able to ‚Äúread‚Äù content of images much easier now. The model is now available for public use on GitHub. Only the devs and coders can understand what Google is trying to say but simply put, the company is doing everyhing in its power to become more intelligent and more useful. Data gathered by Street View cars will be analyzed carefully and together with Deep Learning, the system will be able to identify more details like numbers and street names. With all these enhancements, Google can then map a whole town or city more effectively than ever.

More headlines record a crisis that jeopardises our continued ability to record, or write headlines, about anything. The Fairfax Media reporters striking to try to salvage their profession are respected colleagues, former workmates and friends. Their managers are struggling with the same upended business model we all face, albeit with a strategy very different from Guardian Australia‚Äôs. We‚Äôre competitors, but this is about something bigger than either organisation; how we retain democratic accountability and reasonable public conversation if there aren‚Äôt enough journalists left anywhere to scrutinise and question and expose. Fairfax journalists picket investor meeting as CEO Greg Hywood defends cuts Read more Running a news organisation over the last decade has been a bit like swimming into a set of enormous dumpers; just when companies think they‚Äôve found their feet another wave of change pitches them over again. In the latest and most destructive wave, social media platforms such as Google, Facebook and Snapchat have morphed from technology companies to publishers, swallowing much of the advertising revenue that once kept traditional media companies afloat and warping revenue incentives so that the best, most important journalism is rewarded the least. As Emily Bell, director of the Tow centre for digital journalism at Columbia University (and a member of the Scott Trust which owns the Guardian), wrote here recently: ‚ÄúBy acting like technology companies, while in fact taking on the role of publishers, Google, Facebook and others, have accidentally designed a system that elevates the cheapest and ‚Äòmost engaging‚Äô content at the expense of more expensive but less ‚Äòspreadable‚Äô material. Anyone who wants to reach a million people with a poorly produced conspiracy theory video is in luck. If, however, you want to run a well-resourced newsroom covering a town of 200,000 people, that is not going to be sustainable.‚Äù News companies are shedding jobs around the world, including at the Guardian in the US and the UK. The Australian media union, the MEAA, calculates a quarter of Australia‚Äôs journalism jobs have been lost since 2011, as companies fought through the initial disruption of digital journalism overtaking print. Now Fairfax is shedding 125 more, a quarter of its remaining workforce. News Corp is also cutting, and no one is quite sure where it is all going to stop. And this crisis in the media is intertwined with the crisis in democracy, the devaluation of truth, the cooption of ‚Äúfake news‚Äù by a president angry at a free press determinedly exposing his lies and the disappearance of roles for specialist journalists who have the knowledge to properly hold politicians and institutions to account. Katharine Viner, the Guardian‚Äôs editor in chief, wrote in a 2016 essay that ‚Äúabove all, the challenge for journalism today is not simply technological innovation or the creation of new business models. It is to establish what role journalistic organisations still play in a public discourse that has become impossibly fragmented and radically destabilised. The stunning political developments of the past year ‚Äì including the vote for Brexit and the emergence of Donald Trump as the Republican candidate for the US presidency ‚Äì are not simply the byproducts of a resurgent populism or the revolt of those left behind by global capitalism. ‚ÄúA strong journalistic culture is worth fighting for. So is a business model that serves and rewards media organisations that put the search for truth at the heart of everything ‚Äì building an informed, active public that scrutinises the powerful, not an ill-informed, reactionary gang that attacks the vulnerable.‚Äù But exactly how to do that in practice remains a challenge. Bell suggests the answer might lie with the the same companies that swallowed the old model, noting that the founders of Facebook and Google ‚Äúdo not have to maximise profitability for shareholders. They retain control of the companies and could therefore decide to prioritise the support of high-quality journalism.‚Äù Readers are ready to support real journalism with real money, but only if the social contract changes Jay Rosen Australia academic Margaret Simons had similar thoughts in a recent article in Guardian Australia. ‚ÄúFirst, social media companies will begin to invest in quality content, because otherwise they will lose their audiences. This is not merely wishful thinking. In China, WeChat, owned by Tencent Corporation, is the dominant social media engine and has functionality that makes Facebook and Twitter look old-fashioned. If you want to know what‚Äôs coming next in social media, look to China. ‚ÄúAs I found on a recent research trip to China, WeChat is investing a lot of money in original journalism. Many of the most interesting journalists in China ‚Äì including some who have been jailed in the past for their work ‚Äì are now earning better salaries than those available on party media outlets by freelancing for Tencent, which actively supports and encourages them in multiple ways.‚Äù Simons, and others - most prominently Eric Beecher, a former Fairfax editor and now media proprietor, suggest we won‚Äôt survive this dumper without some kind of public funding, pointing to France, which has had a media subsidy system for years, and to Canada, where the government is looking at options to do the same. They might be right, although I worry about the price, whether our political system would be robust enough to cope with public funding for a wider range of voices. Would all tough journalism and every view and opinion then be subject to the hysterical reaction the ABC now gets from those it exposes or somehow offends? Because every time a politician says an ‚ÄúunAustralian‚Äù story should not have been run, or demands an ABC employee be sacked, they rely on the contention that the ‚Äúoutrage‚Äù should not be funded on the ‚Äútaxpayers‚Äô dime‚Äù, the public funding providing the ever-convenient way of sidelining opposing voices while continuing to claim support for free speech. Elsewhere, other innovative ideas are emerging. In Holland, De Correspondent funds 21 full time reporters and many more freelancers through members who are deeply involved in the reporters‚Äô work. It is now expanding to the US and New York University journalism professor Jay Rosen, is leading a project to investigate how the model could be used further. In a recent blog post, he explained he was enthusiastic about the model ‚Äúbecause Trump is manufacturing mistrust at a faster rate than journalists can adapt their methods for inspiring public confidence in what they do. Because we don‚Äôt have a lot of time, people. Because readers, viewers, listeners, waking up to the urgency of the moment, are ready to support real journalism with real money, but only if the social contract changes ‚Ä¶ Because the production of public interest news cannot be successful without the reproduction of trust in the people who are authoring that news.‚Äù In any case those of us riding the dumpers right now haven‚Äôt really got time to hang around musing about whether governments will ever decide on a public funding model, or tech giants will ever step in, we just have to find a way to continue to do a job as important as it ever was. Guardian Australia has spent the last four years building a serious Australian news operation that, with a far smaller budget than even the new lean versions of the old players, provides a broad sweep of daily news, sport, culture and comment, has broken major stories, and been recognised with a swag of awards. Walkley awards: wins for Guardian Australia's Ben Doherty and Greg Jericho Read more We began with a seeding loan from philanthropist Graeme Wood. Since last August we‚Äôve been asking readers who like our Australian journalism to become members and help fund it. In their wonderful tens of thousands, they have, supplementing our advertising revenue and leaving our business plan on track. I‚Äôm not suggesting for a second we‚Äôve found all the answers. There are so many stories I wish we could cover, so many days when our newsroom‚Äôs resources fall short and, quite probably, another set of dumpers is forming somewhere on the horizon. But in a similar way to De Correspondent‚Äôs model, asking readers to pay voluntarily means we are rewarded for the journalism they value the most. It means we raise far more money from good journalism than from clickbait. The headlines about the media industry are dire for good reason. But decent, trusted journalism is something worth fighting for, and Australia needs us, and our competitors, to succeed. ‚Ä¢ How technology disrupted the truth | Katharine Viner ‚Ä¢ Technology company?

After several years of service, the Google Play Top Developer program is being put to rest Jordan Palmer Follow View All Posts 2017/05/05 3:20pm PDTMay 5, 2017 15 Plus 1 on G+ 23 Share on Facebook 43 Share on Twitter Total Shares81 Google News The Top Developers program launched several years ago¬†as a method of drawing attention to devs who put out great apps. We all started seeing the little blue arrow badge next to some of the developers' names, but it got easy to grow accustomed and eventually jaded to it.¬† The time has come, it seems, to say goodbye to the program. Google has sent out an email to some developers discussing the eclipse of the Top Developers badge and system, but there's also a promise of something new on the horizon. The Play Store's app recognition methodology¬†will soon have more of a focus on individual apps and games that are worth noting, instead of an entire dev account. Here's the email: "The Google Play Top Developer program was created to recognize partners who developed top quality Android apps and games Every day developers like you are hard at work creating apps and games on Android. Whether you‚Äôre updating an existing app or building something new, we‚Äôve seen an incredible increase in the level of polish and quality in so many fun, entertaining, and useful apps. We want to make sure more people find the great experiences you are creating. The Google Play Top Developer program launched many years ago to recognize developers who created high quality Android apps and games. We conducted research, with both developers and consumers, and observed a clear value and preference for the recognition of individual apps and games, instead of entire organizations. After taking a look at our existing app recognition programs, the Google Play editorial team has decided to focus its efforts on recognizing high quality and innovative apps and games. As a first step, we will be closing the Top Developer program and removing the badging from the Play Store within 30 days. We have exciting plans to recognize more of the great apps and games you create and will be sharing updates soon. We thank you for your continued commitment to Android and Google Play." It's hard to say that this is a bad thing.¬†It will be interesting to see what Google has up its sleeve for the future of app recognition in the Play Store.

Artem Russakovskii The top developer badge stopped being meaningful to me when I saw it given out to developers with lots of bought users, reviews, tons of IAPs, etc. What I'd much rather see is a verified check mark similar to Twitter, Facebook, and G+ so people can be assured they're looking at the right dev account and not a copycat. YaKillaCJ This right here. I feel like what's needed is an Official Badge to recognized Apps. This way the average person doesn't get tricked. NooSH we need "top messaging apps".

Android Pay v1.22 prepares Visual ID facial recognition based on Hands Free and reveals testing for Brazil, Trinidad & Tobago, and Canada [APK Teardown] Cody Toombs Follow View All Posts 2017/05/05 1:23pm PDTMay 5, 2017 37 Plus 1 on G+ 23 Share on Facebook 46 Share on Twitter Total Shares106 APK Teardown Applications Downloads News Article Contents 1 Teardown 1.1 New Currencies 1.2 Hands Free returns as Visual ID 1.3 Testing and error reporting tools 2 Download Android Pay may not have had a massive launch, or has it been as aggressively rolled out as Samsung Pay, but it is steadily setting up shop in more countries around the globe. If you don't happen to find yourself in one of the dozen countries that have either already seen a launch or at least have an official promise of one coming soon, you might be interested to know that Google has at least set its sights on a few other countries. Text in the latest update of the Android Pay app hints at four previously unannounced markets. There are also obvious signs Google is merging the recently closed Hands Free experiment into Android Pay and expanding it significantly. Teardown Disclaimer: Teardowns are based on evidence found inside of apks (Android's application package) and are necessarily speculative and usually based on incomplete information. It's possible that the guesses made here are totally and completely wrong. Even when predictions are correct, there is always a chance that plans could change or may be canceled entirely. Much like rumors, nothing is certain until it's officially announced and released. The features discussed below are probably not live yet, or may only be live for a small percentage of users. Unless stated otherwise, don't expect to see these features if you install the apk. New Currencies The evidence for this one comes in the form of a new list of currency codes. Most of them relate to countries where Android Pay is already active, or at least Google has already said it will be soon. However, four of them belong to countries that haven't been officially announced yet. The list of currencies includes: Brazilian Real Trinidad & Tobago Dollar Irish Pound Canadian Dollar Correction: Ireland was added in December 2016. I was using an incorrect source list that was missing the rollout to AIB, KBC, and Ulster Bank. Thanks,¬†Daniel Brierton and Ail√≠n √ì'S. Of course, a teardown already told us last year that Canada is on the list, but Google hasn't actually taken the plunge to publicly commit. The other three are new. Rumors have circulated about all of them, particularly Brazil, which has been more officially mentioned by companies involved with the rollout of NFC-based payment terminals. Nevertheless, there haven't been any official statements about expansion into these countries by Google. Currency Codes <string-array name="currency_code"> <item>Please make a selection</item> <item>USD</item> <item>GBP</item> <item>SGD</item> <item>AUD</item> <item>HKD</item> <item>BRL</item>¬† // Brazilian Real <item>TTD</item>¬† // Trinidad & Tobago Dollar <item>PLN</item> <item>IEP</item>¬† // Irish pound <item>CAD</item>¬† // Canadian Dollar <item>JPY</item> <item>NZD</item> <item>OTHER</item> </string-array> This list doesn't appear to actually serve a purpose for regular users. Rather, it appears to be a tool for testers that need to switch currencies while working with payment terminals. As such, I'm not so sure the list won't be removed in the future, but at least it gives us some insight into what's coming. Unfortunately, it also doesn't tell us when to expect a launch in these new locales. Naturally, we'll keep an eye out for new information as it becomes available. A quick note about currencies: I copied Google's names for the currency codes directly. It's possible the Android Pay developers don't actually mean for IEP to be the Irish Pound, but may be using it as a symbolic reference to the Euro when it's used in Ireland. That would make sense if there are different rules or tax laws at processing time. Hands Free returns as Visual ID Many people probably didn't pay much attention to the Hands Free trial Google launched in and around its home base last year. To summarize, it's basically a new way to complete an in-person transaction without using a phone or card. Actually, you still need your phone with you because it relies on the various technologies that make up location services (i.e. Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS); but Instead of tapping it to a payment terminal, customers say "I'll pay with Google" and give their initials to the cashier, then their identity is confirmed using a camera and Google's facial recognition technology. A couple of months ago, the pilot program for Hands Free was shuttered, but Google left it with a somewhat promising message that hinted it wasn't really dead. Now it's clear why the message was so upbeat: Google is rolling Hands Free into Android Pay. It appears the feature will be branded Visual ID. code <string name="handsfree_landing_text1">It‚Äôs as simple as snapping a picture</string> <string name="handsfree_landing_text2">A camera will recognize you at the register</string> <string name="handsfree_landing_text3">Your points will be applied automatically</string> <string name="handsfree_landing_title">Never miss out on points again</string> <string name="handsfree_landing_title1">One-time setup</string> <string name="handsfree_landing_title2">Works like magic</string> <string name="handsfree_landing_title3">Just pay &amp; go</string> <string name="handsfree_learn_more">Learn more about Visual ID</string> <string name="handsfree_setting_title">Visual ID</string> <string name="handsfree_skip_button_title">Skip</string> <string name="handsfree_turn_on_button">Turn on</string> <string name="handsfree_welcome_button">See how it works</string> <string name="handsfree_photo_setup_title">Snap a picture of yourself</string> <string name="handsfree_photo_setup_subtitle">This will help Android Pay recognize you at the register</string> <string name="handsfree_permissions_title">Visual ID uses location &amp; Bluetooth</string> <string name="handsfree_permissions_text">Make sure you have both turned on so that Android Pay can recognize you at the register</string> <string name="handsfree_photo_error_subtitle">Make sure the photo clearly shows your face with no one else in the frame</string> <string name="handsfree_photo_error_title">Let‚Äôs try that again</string> Google promises to keep privacy intact by never sharing your picture with the merchant and deleting any images taken by its cameras within the store. Obviously, that doesn't impact the store's own cameras. <string name="handsfree_consent_text_identity_text">Google creates and stores a face template based on the photo you save during setup. When you're at a participating store, Visual ID will automatically confirm your identity using facial recognition technology (your face template is compared to the image captured by the in-store Visual ID camera). Images captured by the in-store Visual ID camera can't be accessed by the store and are deleted shortly after they're captured. They‚Äôre not stored or saved.</string> Also worth noting is that this doesn't prevent customers from enjoying their loyalty cards. Google will also match stored membership cards with the merchant and automatically apply them when your identity is confirmed. code <string name="handsfree_consent_subtitle">Visual ID is a secure way to confirm your identity at participating stores, making it easier to do things like earn loyalty points and redeem rewards.</string> <string name="handsfree_loyalty_card_message">Visual ID is on and your loyalty points will be automatically applied at checkout</string> <string name="handsfree_setting_description">At participating stores, Android Pay will recognize you at the register and automatically apply your loyalty points</string> <string name="handsfree_loyalty_card_error_message">Your photo has not uploaded.

You can turn Visual ID off at any time by changing your Android Pay settings.</string> Visual ID will require a camera mounted at checkout locations in stores, which means it's probably not going to become a widespread feature anytime soon. However, if it can garner lower transaction fees from banks or offer unique benefits for stores where customers actually need truly hands-free purchasing ‚Äì picture Starbucks and other places where people often carry things in and out without having time to organize ‚Äì it may catch on in a few places pretty quickly. Testing and error reporting tools While it's not at all important to us as users, there were some other bits included with this release for use by testers. When issues arise during use, they can report the nature of the test and what issues came up. The "engagement type" lists the type of tests, including: Ninja Field Testing (I love this name), Smoke Testing, Country Launch Testing, and Other. I don't have much to say about the rest of it, but for those that are curious, take a look at the rest of the reporting options. code <string-array name="engagement_type"> <item>Please make a selection</item> <item>Ninja Field Testing</item> <item>Smoke Testing</item> <item>Country Launch Testing</item> <item>Other</item> </string-array> <string-array name="hiccup_type"> <item>Please make a selection</item> <item>Unexpected keyguard</item> <item>Repeated keyguard</item> <item>Multiple taps required</item> <item>No hiccups</item> <item>Other</item> </string-array> <string-array name="terminal_message"> <item>Please make a selection</item> <item>Approved</item> <item>Decline</item> <item>Insert card</item> <item>Present one card</item> <item>Card type not accepted</item> <item>Terminal froze/crashed</item> <item>Terminal restarted</item> <item>Other</item> </string-array> <string-array name="terminal_type"> <item>Please make a selection</item> <item>Veriphone vx 820</item> <item>Veriphone vx 520</item> <item>Other</item> </string-array> <string-array name="user_perceived_result"> <item>Please make a selection</item> <item>Success no problems</item> <item>Success with hiccups</item> <item>Failure</item> </string-array> Download The APK is signed by Google and upgrades your existing app. The cryptographic signature guarantees that the file is safe to install and was not tampered with in any way.

Here in Ireland we've used the Euro since 2002, why would they add support for a dead currency? And we've already got android pay anyway... Cody Toombs I searched Google for the currency code and copied what they had listed for IEP. Perhaps the Android Pay developers don't actually mean for it to be the Irish Pound, but just using it ass a symbolic reference to the Euro when it's used in Ireland. That would make sense if there are different rules or tax laws at processing time. Daniel Brierton Also, Android Pay is already available in Ireland with AIB and KBC. Ail√≠n √ì‚ÄôS And Ulster Bank too since the other day. Cody Toombs Thanks for the heads up to both you and @Popple3:disqus. I've updated the article to clarify that Ireland isn't new. Ail√≠n √ì‚ÄôS No worries Cody. I'm still truly confused about the references to Irish Punt though üòÇüòÖ ozone89 Meanwhile, I'm tied to BOI üò© Ail√≠n √ì‚ÄôS They'll launch with Samsung Pay in a month or so. I'm sure of it üòÇ Ail√≠n √ì‚ÄôS The reference to "Irish Pound" is bizarre. That currency which we called Punt (Irish for Pound) hasn't been in use since the early 2000s when we switched to ‚Ç¨, and anyway, we have had Android Pay since December 2016. Bizarre. Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà So, can I tape a picture of a rich person over my face, and use their credit card data and buy really expensive stuff? DavidW username checks out Matt If you steal their credit card and google account information....no. Assuming the person wouldn't ring you up if you were wearing a mask. Matt It seems like installing facial recognition cameras in stores is a lot more difficult than a screen that just shows them a picture of me. It's not like they don't know what I look like - they're looking right at me. mike shwilly News articles say that Android Pay will be launched in Russia on 16th May Cody Toombs Yeah, Russia and South Korea have been confirmed either by Google, partners, or other companies involved in the rollout. They're definitely happening this year, but the dates have always been a little sloppy. I think we'll see at least a half dozen other countries by the end of the year, and maybe more. The adoption rate has been picking up. newtonfb Still waiting for Paypal to be activated.... HUEHUE BR OMG BRAZIIIIIIIL Renan Oh my god, I think I've wet my pants when I saw Brazil getting Android Pay love. God please yes! Ail√≠n √ì‚ÄôS Are NFC/Contactless terminals and Contactless debit/credit cards common in Brazil? Renan Not at all :P At least not where I live... but, to be honest, I've never asked, because I can't use even Samsung Pay (which seems to be supported here) because my old S5 doesn't seems to support it (and I'm using Lineage OS, anyway). But having support will increase interest, which will make more and more terminals to support NFC/contactless and will make contactless cards more common (or at least I hope so) Ail√≠n √ì‚ÄôS Ah, that's good Samsung Pay is there, hopefully that is encouraging Contactless take up. I suppose maybe Brazil relies a lot on the old card swipe technology and hence Samsung Pay would be of great use? When you go to pay with card don't you ever see the Contactless symbol there? I know nothing about the Brazilian payments market hence my curiosity üòÇ Thalles Ferreira Look, don't know where Renan lives in Brazil, not telling he's wrong, we're the size of a continent... But in S√£o Paulo and Rio, contactless terminals are now very common, many of them with stickers of Samsung Pay or NFC symbol. About the bank technology, it's bizarre, but Brazil uses by a decade or more the chip technology that US struggles to implement now. Here it's one of the most technical‚Äãadvanced in financial market of the world (sorry about this sentence, my English ain't that good). But paying with cell phone is awkward for most people here... It looks like a Jetsons future lol. But there are banks taking the next step, removing physical use of banks (only auto terminals) or changing the old numeric password for biometrics, not only in the app but in the terminals too. If you have other questions, I'm glad to explain, as I love the theme lol Fernando Pena Actually, they are pretty common. Most credit card terminals in Brasil are NFC supported these days (those from CIELO, REDE etc), they usually have a symbol near the screen that indicates it's supported. But many people don't know that... I have friends that use NFC payments all the time, from banks like "Banco do Brasil". Fernando Pena I really hope Nubank is related to this Android Pay initiative in Brasil. They are promising this for quite some time (maybe a year by now) and I use their card A LOT.

Android Pay v1.22 prepares Visual ID facial recognition based on Hands Free and reveals testing for Brazil, Trinidad & Tobago, and Canada [APK Teardown] Cody Toombs Follow View All Posts 2017/05/05 1:23pm PDTMay 5, 2017 37 Plus 1 on G+ 23 Share on Facebook 46 Share on Twitter Total Shares106 APK Teardown Applications Downloads News Article Contents 1 Teardown 1.1 New Currencies 1.2 Hands Free returns as Visual ID 1.3 Testing and error reporting tools 2 Download Android Pay may not have had a massive launch, or has it been as aggressively rolled out as Samsung Pay, but it is steadily setting up shop in more countries around the globe. If you don't happen to find yourself in one of the dozen countries that have either already seen a launch or at least have an official promise of one coming soon, you might be interested to know that Google has at least set its sights on a few other countries. Text in the latest update of the Android Pay app hints at four previously unannounced markets. There are also obvious signs Google is merging the recently closed Hands Free experiment into Android Pay and expanding it significantly. Teardown Disclaimer: Teardowns are based on evidence found inside of apks (Android's application package) and are necessarily speculative and usually based on incomplete information. It's possible that the guesses made here are totally and completely wrong. Even when predictions are correct, there is always a chance that plans could change or may be canceled entirely. Much like rumors, nothing is certain until it's officially announced and released. The features discussed below are probably not live yet, or may only be live for a small percentage of users. Unless stated otherwise, don't expect to see these features if you install the apk. New Currencies The evidence for this one comes in the form of a new list of currency codes. Most of them relate to countries where Android Pay is already active, or at least Google has already said it will be soon. However, four of them belong to countries that haven't been officially announced yet. The list of currencies includes: Brazilian Real Trinidad & Tobago Dollar Irish Pound Canadian Dollar Correction: Ireland was added in December 2016. I was using an incorrect source list that was missing the rollout to AIB, KBC, and Ulster Bank. Thanks,¬†Daniel Brierton and Ail√≠n √ì'S. Of course, a teardown already told us last year that Canada is on the list, but Google hasn't actually taken the plunge to publicly commit. The other three are new. Rumors have circulated about all of them, particularly Brazil, which has been more officially mentioned by companies involved with the rollout of NFC-based payment terminals. Nevertheless, there haven't been any official statements about expansion into these countries by Google. Currency Codes <string-array name="currency_code"> <item>Please make a selection</item> <item>USD</item> <item>GBP</item> <item>SGD</item> <item>AUD</item> <item>HKD</item> <item>BRL</item>¬† // Brazilian Real <item>TTD</item>¬† // Trinidad & Tobago Dollar <item>PLN</item> <item>IEP</item>¬† // Irish pound <item>CAD</item>¬† // Canadian Dollar <item>JPY</item> <item>NZD</item> <item>OTHER</item> </string-array> This list doesn't appear to actually serve a purpose for regular users. Rather, it appears to be a tool for testers that need to switch currencies while working with payment terminals. As such, I'm not so sure the list won't be removed in the future, but at least it gives us some insight into what's coming. Unfortunately, it also doesn't tell us when to expect a launch in these new locales. Naturally, we'll keep an eye out for new information as it becomes available. A quick note about currencies: I copied Google's names for the currency codes directly. It's possible the Android Pay developers don't actually mean for IEP to be the Irish Pound, but may be using it as a symbolic reference to the Euro when it's used in Ireland. That would make sense if there are different rules or tax laws at processing time. Hands Free returns as Visual ID Many people probably didn't pay much attention to the Hands Free trial Google launched in and around its home base last year. To summarize, it's basically a new way to complete an in-person transaction without using a phone or card. Actually, you still need your phone with you because it relies on the various technologies that make up location services (i.e. Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS); but Instead of tapping it to a payment terminal, customers say "I'll pay with Google" and give their initials to the cashier, then their identity is confirmed using a camera and Google's facial recognition technology. A couple of months ago, the pilot program for Hands Free was shuttered, but Google left it with a somewhat promising message that hinted it wasn't really dead. Now it's clear why the message was so upbeat: Google is rolling Hands Free into Android Pay. It appears the feature will be branded Visual ID. code <string name="handsfree_landing_text1">It‚Äôs as simple as snapping a picture</string> <string name="handsfree_landing_text2">A camera will recognize you at the register</string> <string name="handsfree_landing_text3">Your points will be applied automatically</string> <string name="handsfree_landing_title">Never miss out on points again</string> <string name="handsfree_landing_title1">One-time setup</string> <string name="handsfree_landing_title2">Works like magic</string> <string name="handsfree_landing_title3">Just pay &amp; go</string> <string name="handsfree_learn_more">Learn more about Visual ID</string> <string name="handsfree_setting_title">Visual ID</string> <string name="handsfree_skip_button_title">Skip</string> <string name="handsfree_turn_on_button">Turn on</string> <string name="handsfree_welcome_button">See how it works</string> <string name="handsfree_photo_setup_title">Snap a picture of yourself</string> <string name="handsfree_photo_setup_subtitle">This will help Android Pay recognize you at the register</string> <string name="handsfree_permissions_title">Visual ID uses location &amp; Bluetooth</string> <string name="handsfree_permissions_text">Make sure you have both turned on so that Android Pay can recognize you at the register</string> <string name="handsfree_photo_error_subtitle">Make sure the photo clearly shows your face with no one else in the frame</string> <string name="handsfree_photo_error_title">Let‚Äôs try that again</string> Google promises to keep privacy intact by never sharing your picture with the merchant and deleting any images taken by its cameras within the store. Obviously, that doesn't impact the store's own cameras. <string name="handsfree_consent_text_identity_text">Google creates and stores a face template based on the photo you save during setup. When you're at a participating store, Visual ID will automatically confirm your identity using facial recognition technology (your face template is compared to the image captured by the in-store Visual ID camera). Images captured by the in-store Visual ID camera can't be accessed by the store and are deleted shortly after they're captured. They‚Äôre not stored or saved.</string> Also worth noting is that this doesn't prevent customers from enjoying their loyalty cards. Google will also match stored membership cards with the merchant and automatically apply them when your identity is confirmed. code <string name="handsfree_consent_subtitle">Visual ID is a secure way to confirm your identity at participating stores, making it easier to do things like earn loyalty points and redeem rewards.</string> <string name="handsfree_loyalty_card_message">Visual ID is on and your loyalty points will be automatically applied at checkout</string> <string name="handsfree_setting_description">At participating stores, Android Pay will recognize you at the register and automatically apply your loyalty points</string> <string name="handsfree_loyalty_card_error_message">Your photo has not uploaded.

You can turn Visual ID off at any time by changing your Android Pay settings.</string> Visual ID will require a camera mounted at checkout locations in stores, which means it's probably not going to become a widespread feature anytime soon. However, if it can garner lower transaction fees from banks or offer unique benefits for stores where customers actually need truly hands-free purchasing ‚Äì picture Starbucks and other places where people often carry things in and out without having time to organize ‚Äì it may catch on in a few places pretty quickly. Testing and error reporting tools While it's not at all important to us as users, there were some other bits included with this release for use by testers. When issues arise during use, they can report the nature of the test and what issues came up. The "engagement type" lists the type of tests, including: Ninja Field Testing (I love this name), Smoke Testing, Country Launch Testing, and Other. I don't have much to say about the rest of it, but for those that are curious, take a look at the rest of the reporting options. code <string-array name="engagement_type"> <item>Please make a selection</item> <item>Ninja Field Testing</item> <item>Smoke Testing</item> <item>Country Launch Testing</item> <item>Other</item> </string-array> <string-array name="hiccup_type"> <item>Please make a selection</item> <item>Unexpected keyguard</item> <item>Repeated keyguard</item> <item>Multiple taps required</item> <item>No hiccups</item> <item>Other</item> </string-array> <string-array name="terminal_message"> <item>Please make a selection</item> <item>Approved</item> <item>Decline</item> <item>Insert card</item> <item>Present one card</item> <item>Card type not accepted</item> <item>Terminal froze/crashed</item> <item>Terminal restarted</item> <item>Other</item> </string-array> <string-array name="terminal_type"> <item>Please make a selection</item> <item>Veriphone vx 820</item> <item>Veriphone vx 520</item> <item>Other</item> </string-array> <string-array name="user_perceived_result"> <item>Please make a selection</item> <item>Success no problems</item> <item>Success with hiccups</item> <item>Failure</item> </string-array> Download The APK is signed by Google and upgrades your existing app. The cryptographic signature guarantees that the file is safe to install and was not tampered with in any way.

Here in Ireland we've used the Euro since 2002, why would they add support for a dead currency? And we've already got android pay anyway... Cody Toombs I searched Google for the currency code and copied what they had listed for IEP. Perhaps the Android Pay developers don't actually mean for it to be the Irish Pound, but just using it ass a symbolic reference to the Euro when it's used in Ireland. That would make sense if there are different rules or tax laws at processing time. Daniel Brierton Also, Android Pay is already available in Ireland with AIB and KBC. Ail√≠n √ì‚ÄôS And Ulster Bank too since the other day. Cody Toombs Thanks for the heads up to both you and @Popple3:disqus. I've updated the article to clarify that Ireland isn't new. Ail√≠n √ì‚ÄôS No worries Cody. I'm still truly confused about the references to Irish Punt though üòÇüòÖ ozone89 Meanwhile, I'm tied to BOI üò© Ail√≠n √ì‚ÄôS They'll launch with Samsung Pay in a month or so. I'm sure of it üòÇ Ail√≠n √ì‚ÄôS The reference to "Irish Pound" is bizarre. That currency which we called Punt (Irish for Pound) hasn't been in use since the early 2000s when we switched to ‚Ç¨, and anyway, we have had Android Pay since December 2016. Bizarre. Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà So, can I tape a picture of a rich person over my face, and use their credit card data and buy really expensive stuff? DavidW username checks out Matt If you steal their credit card and google account information....no. Assuming the person wouldn't ring you up if you were wearing a mask. Matt It seems like installing facial recognition cameras in stores is a lot more difficult than a screen that just shows them a picture of me. It's not like they don't know what I look like - they're looking right at me. mike shwilly News articles say that Android Pay will be launched in Russia on 16th May Cody Toombs Yeah, Russia and South Korea have been confirmed either by Google, partners, or other companies involved in the rollout. They're definitely happening this year, but the dates have always been a little sloppy. I think we'll see at least a half dozen other countries by the end of the year, and maybe more. The adoption rate has been picking up. newtonfb Still waiting for Paypal to be activated.... HUEHUE BR OMG BRAZIIIIIIIL Renan Oh my god, I think I've wet my pants when I saw Brazil getting Android Pay love. God please yes! Ail√≠n √ì‚ÄôS Are NFC/Contactless terminals and Contactless debit/credit cards common in Brazil? Renan Not at all :P At least not where I live... but, to be honest, I've never asked, because I can't use even Samsung Pay (which seems to be supported here) because my old S5 doesn't seems to support it (and I'm using Lineage OS, anyway). But having support will increase interest, which will make more and more terminals to support NFC/contactless and will make contactless cards more common (or at least I hope so) Ail√≠n √ì‚ÄôS Ah, that's good Samsung Pay is there, hopefully that is encouraging Contactless take up. I suppose maybe Brazil relies a lot on the old card swipe technology and hence Samsung Pay would be of great use? When you go to pay with card don't you ever see the Contactless symbol there? I know nothing about the Brazilian payments market hence my curiosity üòÇ Thalles Ferreira Look, don't know where Renan lives in Brazil, not telling he's wrong, we're the size of a continent... But in S√£o Paulo and Rio, contactless terminals are now very common, many of them with stickers of Samsung Pay or NFC symbol. About the bank technology, it's bizarre, but Brazil uses by a decade or more the chip technology that US struggles to implement now. Here it's one of the most technical‚Äãadvanced in financial market of the world (sorry about this sentence, my English ain't that good). But paying with cell phone is awkward for most people here... It looks like a Jetsons future lol. But there are banks taking the next step, removing physical use of banks (only auto terminals) or changing the old numeric password for biometrics, not only in the app but in the terminals too.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile Google Photos Comes Up With Mother‚Äôs Day Movie Maker Feature, But You Can Do Better By Zara Ali 12 hours ago 16Shares Share Tweet Submit May the 14th be with you! After all, it is the Mother‚Äôs Day. You still have got a few days to get something for your mommy dearest to make the day special for her. Sighting the arrival of the occasion, Google has launched a dedicated Mother‚Äôs Day feature on Google Photos. If you have pictures of your mom stores on your phone, then Google Photos can help make you a virtual card. This feature could be an add-on though, just to make the day an even special¬†by going down the memory lane with your mother. Using this feature is pretty easy as it just requires you to select¬†some images. To make Mother‚Äôs Day movie on Google Photos, you will have first to pick¬†the pictures with your mom from the gallery. After that, the tool would ask you to pick a few¬†photos with your kith and kins. The AI is not specific about the gender while recognising the faces, which means that you can pick your near and dear ones as per your wish. Related Gmail for Android Gets Anti-Phishing Security Check Feature to Warn Users for External Links Advertisement Once you finish the selection drill, Google Photos will begin making the movie. You will get the notification on Google Assistant whenever the movie is ready. Sadly, unlike Facebook Movies (friendversaries, Birthday, etc.) this one does not let you edit the video once it is ready. The lack of editing feature would mean many inevitable flaws in the movie such as repetition of pics, a few blurry images, or HDR versions of the same picture. To make use of this feature, you must have enough photos of your mother and family backed up on Google photos or on your device‚Äôs gallery. Google often introduces special features to commemorate occasions and the Mother‚Äôs Day movie maker is not the first. Related Android Nougat‚Äôs Distribution Registers Steady Growth in May, Thanks to Latest Launches While this feature is fantastic, but your mother¬†would be happier to see something even more special. You have more than a week‚Äôs time to pull off a better gift for your mother, and you can certainly do better than just letting Google do the job for you.

Skip to content Naked Security Computer Security News, Advice and Research sophos.com Free Tools Go Award-winning computer security news Twitter Facebook Google+ LinkedIn Feed The Google-phish-that-was-also-a-worm ‚Äì what happened and what to do 05 May 2017 3 Google, Malware Post navigation Previous: News in brief: Uber faces criminal probe; Cassini dives through Saturn‚Äôs rings; police fined for data breach by Paul Ducklin 0Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Yesterday we wrote about a ‚ÄúGoogle Docs‚Äù phishing campaign that aimed to trick you into authorising a malicious third-party Gmail app so that it could take over your email account and your contact list for its own ends. One of those ends seems to have been to spam out another wave of those same fraudulent emails to your friends and colleagues, in the hope of getting them to authorise the imposter app, and thus to send out another wave of emails, and another, and so on. Technically, that made it more than just a ‚Äúphish‚Äù, which we‚Äôll define very loosely here as an email that aims to trick, coerce or cajole you into performing an authentication task, or giving away personal data, that you later wish you hadn‚Äôt. The classic old-school example of a phish is an email that tells you that you have lost money to fraud, or gained money from a tax refund, so please use this web link to login to your bank account to sort this out. These days, however, the word phishing is generally understood much more broadly, describing any sort of misdirection that gets you to authorise or to give away something you should have kept private. Many users have learned to avoid login links in emails, so the crooks have broadened the range of threats and incentives by which they phish for access to your online life. Sophos Home Destroy malware in your sleep Learn More This week‚Äôs so-called ‚ÄúGoogle Docs‚Äù attack could spread all by itself, helped on by users giving it the permission it needed along the way, just like the infamous Love Bug virus from 2000, or the pernicious FriendGreetings adware from 2002. Technically, then, that makes the ‚ÄúGoogle Docs‚Äù attack a virus, or more specifically a worm, which is a special sort of virus that spreads by itself, without needing pre-existing host files to hook onto. A virus, an actual virus! You don‚Äôt get many of those these days. Firstly, the crooks don‚Äôt really need self-spreading capabilities any more, given that they can as good as dial the malware yield they want, one victim at time, by spamming out attachments or web links until they hit their desired infection level. Secondly, viruses often draw extra attention to themselves as plain malware, because they typically trigger the same sort of security alarms as non-replicating Trojan Horses, plus more. How it worked You‚Äôd start off by receiving an email that looked something like this: You probably recognised the person whose name appeared on the email ‚Äì because it almost certainly came from their account, via their contact list, even though they almost certainly never intended to send it. If you clicked on the [Open in Docs] link, you wouldn‚Äôt actually end up at a Google Document. Instead, you ended up on a web page that asked you to install a Gmail app and authorise it to access both your emails and your contact list: You ought to be have been suspicious by this time ‚Äì after all, you shouldn‚Äôt need an app to handle Google Docs, because they‚Äôll open fine in your browser anyway. (Gmail apps are a bit like Facebook or Twitter apps ‚Äì you give them permission to access your account in return for some added feature. One of the best known examples of this sort is Hootsuite for Twitter, which many of you may use.) Neverthleless, we can understand if you were tempted to click on [Allow] to authorise the app, for two reasons: The email came from someone you knew. The app identified itself as ‚ÄúGoogle Docs‚Äù. The truth was more sinister than this: somehow, Google allowed a crook to register a Gmail app called ‚ÄúGoogle Docs‚Äù, but it had nothing to do with Google, or with documents. If you‚Äôre surprised that an app that seems so obviously intended to leech Google‚Äôs own brand got past Google‚Äôs security vetting process, you aren‚Äôt the only one. If you clicked [Allow], you opened your account to all sorts of abuse, including the aforementioned side-effect of virally spamming out copies of the email to your own contacts. Of course, a Gmail app that can access your contacts and emails can do much more sinister things as well, such as sniffing through your correspondence to steal data, fiddling with your contact list, and deleting incoming messages that might otherwise alert you to its presence. What now? If you didn‚Äôt get as far as clicking [Allow] for the imposter ‚ÄúGoogle Docs‚Äù app, you should be OK. However, this is a good time to check your Google account to see which apps you have authorised to do what to your account. Even if you didn‚Äôt authorise this fraudulent app, you may find other apps that you‚Äôve forgotten about with too much power over your account. The easiest way to check the apps that are connected to your account, once you‚Äôre logged in, is to go to https://myaccount.google.com/permissions. That will show the list of apps that have power over your Google account: remove any apps that you aren‚Äôt sure of or that you no longer need. If you did [Allow] this imposter app, you probably spammed your friends and colleagues with just the same sort of email you received in the first place, so don‚Äôt be surprised if they contact you to question or complain. However, if you receive follow-up emails about this attack, don‚Äôt act on any of the demands they make about clicking links, changing settings and so forth ‚Äì they could be from crooks trying to take advantage of the concern that this spamfest has caused. What next? The annoying thing here is that you didn‚Äôt need to be a Google Docs user to be affected, because the hack wasn‚Äôt against Google Docs. The attack was really against Google‚Äôs whole ‚Äúwalled garden‚Äù ecosystem, where everything is supposed to be vetted for security up front. So it‚Äôs astonishing that Google allowed anyone to register a third-party app called ‚ÄúGoogle Docs‚Äù at all ‚Äì let alone to let a crook register a rogue app going by that name ‚Äì because this effectively gave Google‚Äôs brand and imprimatur to an imposter. If you are a Google account user, even if it‚Äôs only for Gmail, you probably want to wait for Google‚Äôs own investigation into how this happened. Once you understand what extra checks the company will put in place to reduce the risk of this sort of abuse next time, you can decide how comforted you feel by Google‚Äôs response. Having said that, just relying on Google being stricter about how apps describe themselves in future isn‚Äôt enough on its own. With or without Google‚Äôs apparent endorsement, authorising a third party to do stuff to your Google account in this case, to send and read email and access your contacts) is a big step. That‚Äôs a huge amount of power to hand out to someone else ‚Äì try thinking of it like lending them your mobile phone for the rest of the month, or giving them a power of attorney over your credit card account. So don‚Äôt be in a hurry to [Allow] a new app, even if it seems to be part of Google‚Äôs own brand, and no matter how cool and convenient it might sound. Especially, don‚Äôt make such important decisions on the say so of a single email. Take your time, ask people you trust for their opinion, and when it comes to your account, IF IN DOUBT, DON‚ÄôT GIVE IT OUT.

As part of their proceedings TeamDrive Systems GMBH, which makes secure cloud based file sharing software for businesses and personal use, had sought an injunction from the Irish Court preventing Google Ireland Ltd and Google Commerce Ltd from infringing what it says is its 'TeamDrive' trademark. The injunction, which Google has opposed, was to be put in place pending the outcome of the full hearing of the dispute. TeamDrive claims Google's use of a software product which it has called 'Team Drives' infringes the Germany firm's European Registered trademark, which was obtained in 2006. Google denies the infringement, and claims the action against it by the German form it is misconceived. It has also opposed the injunction application on grounds including that such an order would damage its business. After hearing four days of evidence and legal submissions from the parties Mr Justice Tony O'Connor on Friday evening ruled that parallel proceedings brought before the German courts, where the company also seeks similar reliefs against Google, should be determined first before the case continues before the Irish courts. Those parallel German proceedings seeking an injunction were initiated before the Irish action was commenced, the Judge said. The judge said he accepted that while his order was an unusual step it would ultimately save the parties both time and expense. The Judge also noted that both sides agree that the hearing of the full dispute should take place as soon as possible adjourned the case to next week for mention only.

In relation to this, Waymo/Google had requested that a US judge issue an injunction blocking Uber from continuing to test its self-driving vehicle tech. It turns out, though, that the evidence provided by Waymo/Google isn‚Äôt sufficient to get the injunction granted, according to US District Judge William Alsup. Judge Alsup stated at the hearing on the matter that he hadn‚Äôt seen enough clear evidence to grant an injunction, or rather that he ‚Äúwas wrestling with whether to issue an injunction against the ride service,‚Äù as worded by Reuters. Here‚Äôs more from that coverage: ‚ÄúAt a hearing in San Francisco federal court, US District Judge William Alsup said it was undisputed that the engineer, Anthony Levandowski, downloaded about 14,000 documents shortly before he stopped working for Waymo. ‚ÄúIf it were proven that Levandowski and Uber conspired in taking Waymo‚Äôs information, that could have dire consequences for Uber, say legal and ride-hailing industry experts. ‚Ä¶ However, Alsup expressed skepticism over whether Uber actually used any Waymo trade secrets. ‚Ä¶¬†Waymo attorney Charles Verhoeven said the company suspects such evidence exists. Levandowski declined to answer questions during a deposition, citing his constitutional rights against self incrimination.‚Äù Alsup noted: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve given you lots of discovery, and so far you don‚Äôt have any smoking gun.‚Äù On the other hand, Waymo contends that a lot is not being revealed (that should be revealed). ‚ÄúVerhoeven also said Uber was improperly withholding thousands of documents on the grounds that they are confidential legal documents. The judge did not make a ruling from the bench on Wednesday.‚Äù The judge is reportedly still deciding whether or not to send Waymo‚Äôs trade secret theft claims to non-public arbitration.

Google and E.ON will jointly offer Project Sunroof to residents in Germany, the first time the service has been available outside of the United States. Originally conceived and launched back in early-2015 as part of one of Google‚Äôs 20% projects ‚Äî projects Google allows its employees to tackle during 20% of their paid work time ‚Äî Project Sunroof has since become a highly prized tool for consumers looking for information on whether to install solar energy on their roofs, and how to go about it. Using high-resolution aerial mapping provided by Google Earth, Project Sunroof provides consumers with a way to calculate their own roof‚Äôs solar energy potential. Now, with all of the United States covered, Project Sunroof will be available for about 40% of the German population, or around seven million buildings in major German urban areas such as Munich, Berlin, Rhine-Main, and the Ruhr. As E.ON explains, ‚Äúhomeowners can easily and precisely determine their home‚Äôs potential solar capacity and generate plans for installing a solar system. All they need to do is enter their address online.‚Äù ‚ÄúWith Sunroof, we are able to digitize sales of solar systems more intensively and thereby increase the appeal of photovoltaics,‚Äù said Karsten Wildberger, COO of E.ON.¬†‚ÄúIt clearly demonstrates the potential benefits of digitalization for the ongoing shift in energy production. Along with Sunroof and E.ON SolarCloud, we will be developing additional digital products in order to offer our customers the highest degree of independence and security through E.ON solar systems.‚Äù With over 60 million buildings covered in the United States, Project Sunroof statistics show that on average, 79% of all roofs prove suitable for solar power. This obviously varies depending on which state is targeted, with some states such as Arizona reaching peak value of over 90%, while even northern states such as Maine are able to provide up to 60% of rooftops for solar potential. It will be interesting, therefore, to see what the potential of Germany‚Äôs roofs is. ‚ÄúGoogle has been relying on renewable energy sources for many years in supplying the needs of its own infrastructure and beyond,‚Äù explained Philipp Justus, Vice President of Google in Germany and Central Europe.¬†‚ÄúWith Sunroof our goal is to encourage more people tapping into the potential found in their own rooftops.‚Äù Buy a cool T-shirt in the CleanTechnica store!

Android Pay v1.22 prepares Visual ID facial recognition based on Hands Free and reveals testing for Brazil, Trinidad & Tobago, and Canada [APK Teardown] Cody Toombs Follow View All Posts 2017/05/05 1:23pm PDTMay 5, 2017 37 Plus 1 on G+ 23 Share on Facebook 46 Share on Twitter Total Shares106 APK Teardown Applications Downloads News Article Contents 1 Teardown 1.1 New Currencies 1.2 Hands Free returns as Visual ID 1.3 Testing and error reporting tools 2 Download Android Pay may not have had a massive launch, or has it been as aggressively rolled out as Samsung Pay, but it is steadily setting up shop in more countries around the globe. If you don't happen to find yourself in one of the dozen countries that have either already seen a launch or at least have an official promise of one coming soon, you might be interested to know that Google has at least set its sights on a few other countries. Text in the latest update of the Android Pay app hints at four previously unannounced markets. There are also obvious signs Google is merging the recently closed Hands Free experiment into Android Pay and expanding it significantly. Teardown Disclaimer: Teardowns are based on evidence found inside of apks (Android's application package) and are necessarily speculative and usually based on incomplete information. It's possible that the guesses made here are totally and completely wrong. Even when predictions are correct, there is always a chance that plans could change or may be canceled entirely. Much like rumors, nothing is certain until it's officially announced and released. The features discussed below are probably not live yet, or may only be live for a small percentage of users. Unless stated otherwise, don't expect to see these features if you install the apk. New Currencies The evidence for this one comes in the form of a new list of currency codes. Most of them relate to countries where Android Pay is already active, or at least Google has already said it will be soon. However, four of them belong to countries that haven't been officially announced yet. The list of currencies includes: Brazilian Real Trinidad & Tobago Dollar Irish Pound Canadian Dollar Correction: Ireland was added in December 2016. I was using an incorrect source list that was missing the rollout to AIB, KBC, and Ulster Bank. Thanks,¬†Daniel Brierton and Ail√≠n √ì'S. Of course, a teardown already told us last year that Canada is on the list, but Google hasn't actually taken the plunge to publicly commit. The other three are new. Rumors have circulated about all of them, particularly Brazil, which has been more officially mentioned by companies involved with the rollout of NFC-based payment terminals. Nevertheless, there haven't been any official statements about expansion into these countries by Google. Currency Codes <string-array name="currency_code"> <item>Please make a selection</item> <item>USD</item> <item>GBP</item> <item>SGD</item> <item>AUD</item> <item>HKD</item> <item>BRL</item>¬† // Brazilian Real <item>TTD</item>¬† // Trinidad & Tobago Dollar <item>PLN</item> <item>IEP</item>¬† // Irish pound <item>CAD</item>¬† // Canadian Dollar <item>JPY</item> <item>NZD</item> <item>OTHER</item> </string-array> This list doesn't appear to actually serve a purpose for regular users. Rather, it appears to be a tool for testers that need to switch currencies while working with payment terminals. As such, I'm not so sure the list won't be removed in the future, but at least it gives us some insight into what's coming. Unfortunately, it also doesn't tell us when to expect a launch in these new locales. Naturally, we'll keep an eye out for new information as it becomes available. A quick note about currencies: I copied Google's names for the currency codes directly. It's possible the Android Pay developers don't actually mean for IEP to be the Irish Pound, but may be using it as a symbolic reference to the Euro when it's used in Ireland. That would make sense if there are different rules or tax laws at processing time. Hands Free returns as Visual ID Many people probably didn't pay much attention to the Hands Free trial Google launched in and around its home base last year. To summarize, it's basically a new way to complete an in-person transaction without using a phone or card. Actually, you still need your phone with you because it relies on the various technologies that make up location services (i.e. Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS); but Instead of tapping it to a payment terminal, customers say "I'll pay with Google" and give their initials to the cashier, then their identity is confirmed using a camera and Google's facial recognition technology. A couple of months ago, the pilot program for Hands Free was shuttered, but Google left it with a somewhat promising message that hinted it wasn't really dead. Now it's clear why the message was so upbeat: Google is rolling Hands Free into Android Pay. It appears the feature will be branded Visual ID. code <string name="handsfree_landing_text1">It‚Äôs as simple as snapping a picture</string> <string name="handsfree_landing_text2">A camera will recognize you at the register</string> <string name="handsfree_landing_text3">Your points will be applied automatically</string> <string name="handsfree_landing_title">Never miss out on points again</string> <string name="handsfree_landing_title1">One-time setup</string> <string name="handsfree_landing_title2">Works like magic</string> <string name="handsfree_landing_title3">Just pay &amp; go</string> <string name="handsfree_learn_more">Learn more about Visual ID</string> <string name="handsfree_setting_title">Visual ID</string> <string name="handsfree_skip_button_title">Skip</string> <string name="handsfree_turn_on_button">Turn on</string> <string name="handsfree_welcome_button">See how it works</string> <string name="handsfree_photo_setup_title">Snap a picture of yourself</string> <string name="handsfree_photo_setup_subtitle">This will help Android Pay recognize you at the register</string> <string name="handsfree_permissions_title">Visual ID uses location &amp; Bluetooth</string> <string name="handsfree_permissions_text">Make sure you have both turned on so that Android Pay can recognize you at the register</string> <string name="handsfree_photo_error_subtitle">Make sure the photo clearly shows your face with no one else in the frame</string> <string name="handsfree_photo_error_title">Let‚Äôs try that again</string> Google promises to keep privacy intact by never sharing your picture with the merchant and deleting any images taken by its cameras within the store.

However, if it can garner lower transaction fees from banks or offer unique benefits for stores where customers actually need truly hands-free purchasing ‚Äì picture Starbucks and other places where people often carry things in and out without having time to organize ‚Äì it may catch on in a few places pretty quickly.

When issues arise during use, they can report the nature of the test and what issues came up.

Here in Ireland we've used the Euro since 2002, why would they add support for a dead currency? And we've already got android pay anyway... Cody Toombs I searched Google for the currency code and copied what they had listed for IEP. Perhaps the Android Pay developers don't actually mean for it to be the Irish Pound, but just using it ass a symbolic reference to the Euro when it's used in Ireland. That would make sense if there are different rules or tax laws at processing time. Daniel Brierton Also, Android Pay is already available in Ireland with AIB and KBC. Ail√≠n √ì‚ÄôS And Ulster Bank too since the other day. Cody Toombs Thanks for the heads up to both you and @Popple3:disqus. I've updated the article to clarify that Ireland isn't new. Ail√≠n √ì‚ÄôS No worries Cody. I'm still truly confused about the references to Irish Punt though üòÇüòÖ ozone89 Meanwhile, I'm tied to BOI üò© Ail√≠n √ì‚ÄôS They'll launch with Samsung Pay in a month or so. I'm sure of it üòÇ Ail√≠n √ì‚ÄôS The reference to "Irish Pound" is bizarre. That currency which we called Punt (Irish for Pound) hasn't been in use since the early 2000s when we switched to ‚Ç¨, and anyway, we have had Android Pay since December 2016. Bizarre. Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà So, can I tape a picture of a rich person over my face, and use their credit card data and buy really expensive stuff? DavidW username checks out Matt If you steal their credit card and google account information....no. Assuming the person wouldn't ring you up if you were wearing a mask. Matt It seems like installing facial recognition cameras in stores is a lot more difficult than a screen that just shows them a picture of me. It's not like they don't know what I look like - they're looking right at me. mike shwilly News articles say that Android Pay will be launched in Russia on 16th May Cody Toombs Yeah, Russia and South Korea have been confirmed either by Google, partners, or other companies involved in the rollout. They're definitely happening this year, but the dates have always been a little sloppy. I think we'll see at least a half dozen other countries by the end of the year, and maybe more. The adoption rate has been picking up. newtonfb Still waiting for Paypal to be activated.... HUEHUE BR OMG BRAZIIIIIIIL Renan Oh my god, I think I've wet my pants when I saw Brazil getting Android Pay love. God please yes! Ail√≠n √ì‚ÄôS Are NFC/Contactless terminals and Contactless debit/credit cards common in Brazil? Renan Not at all :P At least not where I live... but, to be honest, I've never asked, because I can't use even Samsung Pay (which seems to be supported here) because my old S5 doesn't seems to support it (and I'm using Lineage OS, anyway). But having support will increase interest, which will make more and more terminals to support NFC/contactless and will make contactless cards more common (or at least I hope so) Ail√≠n √ì‚ÄôS Ah, that's good Samsung Pay is there, hopefully that is encouraging Contactless take up. I suppose maybe Brazil relies a lot on the old card swipe technology and hence Samsung Pay would be of great use? When you go to pay with card don't you ever see the Contactless symbol there? I know nothing about the Brazilian payments market hence my curiosity üòÇ Thalles Ferreira Look, don't know where Renan lives in Brazil, not telling he's wrong, we're the size of a continent... But in S√£o Paulo and Rio, contactless terminals are now very common, many of them with stickers of Samsung Pay or NFC symbol. About the bank technology, it's bizarre, but Brazil uses by a decade or more the chip technology that US struggles to implement now. Here it's one of the most technical‚Äãadvanced in financial market of the world (sorry about this sentence, my English ain't that good). But paying with cell phone is awkward for most people here... It looks like a Jetsons future lol. But there are banks taking the next step, removing physical use of banks (only auto terminals) or changing the old numeric password for biometrics, not only in the app but in the terminals too. If you have other questions, I'm glad to explain, as I love the theme lol Fernando Pena Actually, they are pretty common. Most credit card terminals in Brasil are NFC supported these days (those from CIELO, REDE etc), they usually have a symbol near the screen that indicates it's supported. But many people don't know that... I have friends that use NFC payments all the time, from banks like "Banco do Brasil". Fernando Pena I really hope Nubank is related to this Android Pay initiative in Brasil. They are promising this for quite some time (maybe a year by now) and I use their card A LOT.

On the same day that Facebook‚Äôs WhatsApp was down for the count, some Google users (Fortune‚Äôs Jeff John Roberts suggests that the scam was targeted at journalists) received an email with a seemingly normal Google Docs link. Closer inspection revealed a few oddities. The sender of the mail is the rather hilarious ‚Äúhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh@mailinator.com‚Äù but the consequences of clicking the mail aren‚Äôt. Taking unsuspecting users to a faux OAUTH authentication page, suggesting that Google Docs requires authorisation to open the document. The scam then baits people into sharing their account credentials with the scammer. How exactly? Users unsuspectingly authorise the fake Google Docs account to gain full access to use your Google data. It‚Äôs a pretty smart scam too. A GIF posted to Twitter by hacker Zach Lattav (spotted by Fortune) details what happens after you click the link. Pretty innocuous, right? @zeynep Just got this as well. Super sophisticated. pic.twitter.com/l6c1ljSFIX ‚Äî Zach Latta (@zachlatta) May 3, 2017 Google has since quelled the scam‚Äôs flame, updating users on Wednesday at around 9.30pm SAST on the Google G Suite service log that ‚Äúthe problem‚Äù should be remedied. Google Docs was used in a phishing scam that swept through inboxes across the world Wednesday ‚ÄúWe apologise for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience and continued support. Please rest assured that system reliability is a top priority at Google, and we are making continuous improvements to make our systems better,‚Äù it wrote. Google also took to Twitter. We‚Äôve addressed the issue with a phishing email claiming to be Google Docs. If you think you were affected, visit https://t.co/O68nQjFhBL. pic.twitter.com/AtlX6oNZaf ‚Äî Google Docs (@googledocs) May 3, 2017 There‚Äôs been no word on who was responsible for the scam, nor has Google indicated just how many users might‚Äôve been affected, but for those affected by it are probably more concerned about their security. To check if you‚Äôve been affected, head on over to Google‚Äôs permissions page (you‚Äôll need to be logged in). If ‚ÄúGoogle Docs‚Äù appears on this list, remove it. While you‚Äôre at it, you should probably think about changing your password and enabling two-factor authentication too.

For National Space Day, filmmaker Eliza McNitt looked at subject matter a little closer to home. Through a partnership with Google, she profiled three female astronauts‚ÄîDr Kathryn D. Sullivan, Nicole Stott, and Anousheh Ansari‚Äîand assembled a short, powerful documentary film. The intimate portraits within "Dot of Light" offer access to women who achieved their dreams against great odds. And in one of the film's most captivating moments, Ansari describes with such depth the way it feels to view Earth from afar. All of this has been intercut with archival footage and immersive imagery of space exploration. McNitt's film is an extension of another space-related collaboration with Google. The NY-based artist designed limited edition Live Cases for the Google Pixel and Pixel XL (as well as the Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P). With those, she depicts many important moments of women in space, featuring Mae Jemison, Sally Ride, Kathy Sullivan and more. Of course, she also developed breathtaking scenes including Saturn's rings and the Orion Nebula. As with all Live Cases, these are customizable and impact what shows on the phone's screen, as well, by way of Live Wallpaper. In fact, portions of the documentary were filmed on the Pixel. McNitt was the second artist collaborator to touch upon outer space, following up the stellar cases from astronaut Chris Hadfield‚Äîwho used images he himself took of space. The nine Dot of Light Live Case Artworks by Eliza McNitt are available now for $40 each.

Sean Gallagher - May 5, 2017 8:17 pm UTC Enlarge Sean Gallup / Getty Images reader comments 20 Share this story The "Google Docs" phishing attack that wormed its way through thousands of e-mail inboxes earlier this week exploited a threat that had been flagged¬†earlier by at least three security researchers‚Äîone raised issues about the threat as early as October of 2011.¬†In fact,¬†the person or persons behind the attack may have copied the technique from a proof of concept posted by one security researcher to GitHub in February. Further ReadingAll your Googles are belong to us: Look out for the Google Docs phishing worm The issue may not technically be a vulnerability, but the way Google has implemented its application permissions interface‚Äîbased on the OAuth 2 standard used by a large number of Web application providers‚Äîmakes it far too easy to fool unsuspecting targets into giving away access to their cloud, e-mail, storage, and other Google-associated accounts.¬†The websites used in the phishing attack each used domains that mimicked Google's in some way. The sites would call a Google Apps Script that used Google's own authentication system against itself. The malicious Web application (named "Google Docs") was delivered by an HTML e-mail message that looked so much like a genuine Google Docs sharing request that many users just sailed right through the permissions requested without thinking. Further ReadingDon‚Äôt trust OAuth: Why the ‚ÄúGoogle Docs‚Äù worm was so convincing Researchers have repeatedly warned Google about this potential social engineering threat, and this shortcoming¬†had already been exploited in malicious e-mails used by an alleged state actor. While Google quickly shut down the malicious application's access to customers' credentials, the threat remains, since all it takes to relaunch a campaign is to configure another application with Google's authentication API. Security researcher Greg Carson said that he discovered the issue while his company was migrating users to Google Apps for Enterprise users. "Our team noted this as a risk and informed our users," he explained to Ars via¬†e-mail. "I fleshed out a full PoC on my blog to try to raise awareness because no one had done so to my knowledge. I don't think Google fully understood how severely this could be abused, but certainly hackers did." Carson said that he initially believed the phishing attack essentially just copied and pasted the Google Apps Script code from his GitHub page or from snippets of the code in his blog post. But Carson¬†revised that theory¬†after doing a bit more analysis on the phishing attack. "Looking through [the phishing attack] closely, I don't believe any code was ripped directly," he said. "One of their for loops looked similar to mine, but it isn't a direct copy, so I don't think it's fair to claim that." However, whoever was behind the "Google Docs" e-mail did exactly what Carson discussed in his post. Using a malicious webpage and Google's own authentication interfaces, the attacker was able to gain access to victims' Gmail accounts and harvest contacts to further spread the phishing campaign using the victims' own accounts. "I end the post by talking about how this attack is extremely dangerous," Carson noted. "You can enumerate all of a user's contacts and then send an e-mail to each of them using the victim's account. It's highly deceptive for unaware users as it appears to come from a legitimate contact, and it's hosted by Google. It's a worm of sorts for the modern era, and since the e-mail may appear trusted at a glance, it could be used to link to malicious websites and downloads." Carson had also warned of other attack cases based on malicious Web applications leveraging Google's authentication system, based on the OAuth 2 standard. An attacker could conceivably use keyword searches to identify and harvest sensitive documents off of a Google Drive account. "I wouldn't be surprised if future phishing campaigns employ these techniques." The potential for an OAuth-based attack on Google users was first discussed on an Internet Engineering Task Force OAuth mailing list by researcher Andre DeMarre in October of 2011. DeMarre wrote: Imagine someone registers a client application with an OAuth service, let's call it Foobar, and he names his client app "Google, Inc." The Foobar authorization server will engage the user with "Google, Inc. is requesting permission to do the following." The resource owner might reason, "I see that I'm legitimately on the https://www.foobar.com site, and Foobar is telling me that Google wants permission. I trust Foobar and Google, so I'll click Allow." To make the masquerade act even more convincing, many of the most popular OAuth services allow app developers to upload images which could be official logos of the organizations they are posing as. Often app developers can supply arbitrary, unconfirmed URIs which are shown to the resource owner as the app's website, even if the domain does not match the redirect URI. Some OAuth services blindly entrust client apps to customize the authorization page in other ways. Web developer Andrew Cantino issued a similar warning in a September 2014 blog post. He had built a proof-of-concept Web application called "Google Security Updater" and found that during the authentication process, "Google¬†in no way¬†makes it clear that this app was created by a 3rd party and is not affiliated with Google." Enlarge / An image of Cantino's app being approved. Cantino's Apps Script code only added a new label to Gmail messages. "But it could have deleted data, e-mailed a link to the script to everyone in the user‚Äôs contact list, manipulated personal information, or stolen data and sent it to a 3rd party," he wrote. There are a number of ways that organizations can try to stop future OAuth-based attacks like this week's worm. The use of "look-alike" host names using non-standard top-level domains (TLDs) such as .pro, .win, and .download could potentially be blocked by intrusion prevention systems or DNS "greylisting"¬†or spotted early by monitoring DNS traffic. Carson suggested organizations use cloud access security brokers (CASBs) a term coined by Gartner to describe platforms that run within an organization's network and check cloud applications' permission requests against established policies. A CASB would have blocked access for a fake "Google Docs" application, for example. For individuals, the only real defense is paying close attention to OAuth permission requests and closely examining where they're coming from (and whether they make sense). That will continue to be the case unless Google makes it harder for attackers to spoof Google services. "I'd like to see Google provide better warnings to users when loading applications for Google services and¬†provide Stricter controls for admins around app script authorization,"¬†said Carson.

However, that amounted to fewer than 0.1 percent of Gmail users were affected, according to the company. Google last year put the number of active monthly Gmail users at more than 1 billion. Google shut down the phishing scam within an hour, it said, through both automatic and manual actions. It removed the fake pages and applications, and it pushed updates through Safe Browsing, Gmail and other anti-abuse systems. Users did not need to take any action on their own in response to the attack, Google said, but those who wanted to review third-party apps connected to their account could do so at its Security Checkup site. Anti-Phishing Security Checks Coincidentally, Google this week introduced a new anti-phishing security feature to Gmail on Android. The new tool delivers a warning when a user clicks on a suspicious link in an email message, alerting them that the site they're trying to visit has been identified as a forgery. Users can back away or continue to the site at their own risk. Google is gradually rolling out the new feature to all G Suite users. How the Docs Attack Went Down This week's Docs attack was an effective approach to luring users before Google clamped down. People got an email from someone they knew inviting them to click on a link to collaborate on a Google Doc. Clicking on the "Open in Docs" link redirected them to a Google OAuth 2.0 page to authorize the Google Docs application, which was a fake. The application stated that Google Docs would like to read, send, delete and manage the recipient's email and manage their contacts -- requests common to several applications that use Google as an authentication mechanism. Once the permission was granted, the attacker gained access to the victim's address book, which allowed the attack to go viral swiftly. The OAuth Vulnerability The attack leveraged OAuth, "a ubiquitous industry standard protocol [that provides] a secure way for Web applications and services to connect without requiring users to share their account credentials with those applications," said Ayse Firat, director of analytics and customer insights at Cisco Cloudlock. "Because it's so universally adopted by almost all Web-based applications and platforms -- including consumer as well as enterprise applications such as Google Apps, Office 365, Salesforce, LinkedIn and many others -- it provides a broad attack surface," she told TechNewsWorld. OAuth 2.0 is highly sensitive to phishing because every website using it asks end users for the username and password of their master identity. Cisco CLoudlock has identified more than 275,000 OAuth apps connected to core cloud services, such as Office 365, compared with only 5,500 three years ago. OAuth-based attacks "bypass all standard security layers, including next-generation firewalls, secure Web gateways, single sign-ons, multifactor authentication and more," Firat cautioned. The Ramifications of Using OAuth With software vendors increasingly putting their applications in the cloud, how great a risk do OAuth's vulnerabilities pose for end users? "Most cloud services are pretty secure, and OAuth-based attacks likely will not be successful if services depending on the protocol are otherwise secured," said Michael Jude, a program manager at Stratecast/Frost & Sullivan. OAuth authentication "is bigger than just online apps," he suggested. "It's also a basic establishment protocol that could become important in social media efforts to become more akin to common carriage operations for communications." OAuth "has to be done right, or there's no future for social media-mediated communication services," Jude warned. Protecting Against OAuth-Based Attacks Organizations need to develop a high-level strategy as well as a specific application use policy to decide how they will whitelist or ban applications, and share this vision with their end users, Firat suggested. Individual users should go into their Google account security settings and revoke permissions to applications they don't know or trust, she recommended. They also "should never grant permissions to applications that request excessive access." Efforts have been launched to incorporate stricter security requirements into OAuth, Frost's Jude said, "but I haven't heard of any particular availability."

RSS ALL ARTICLES FEATURES ONLY Search How to Find Out if a Smarthome Device Works with Alexa, Siri, or Google Home and Assistant By Craig Lloyd on May 5th, 2017 Now that voice assistants are becoming extremely popular, many users who want to outfit their living spaces with smarthome products are probably wanting these products to be compatible with their voice assistant, whether it‚Äôs Alexa, Siri, or Google Assistant (and Google Home). Here‚Äôs how to find out whether or not a smarthome device works with these platforms. RELATED ARTICLES How to Set Up and Configure Your Amazon Echo How to Set Up Google Home Look for the Badge on the Product Box Perhaps the easiest and quickest way to see if a smarthome device is compatible with the voice assistant of your choice is to take a look at the product‚Äôs packaging and look for the badge that says what it supports. RELATED ARTICLE Should You Throw Away All of Your Tech Product Boxes? Somewhere on the box you‚Äôll find a small badge that says something like ‚ÄúWorks with Apple HomeKit‚Äù or ‚ÄúWorks with Amazon Alexa‚Äù. You may also just see the Amazon Echo logo, which also tells you that it works with Alexa. However, keep in mind that some product boxes won‚Äôt have these badges printed on them even though they fully support Alexa, Siri, or Google Assistant. Philips Hue boxes, for instance, only have the HomeKit badge, even though they‚Äôre natively supported by Alexa and Google Assistant as well. Because of that, you may want to look for a second source. Visit the Product‚Äôs Website If the product box doesn‚Äôt mention anything about which voice assistants it supports, it may be a good idea to double-check the product‚Äôs website. Usually it will have this information somewhere, whether it‚Äôs on the product‚Äôs main page, spec list, or on the support page. RELATED ARTICLE How to Control Your Smart Home Products with the Amazon Echo On Philips Hue‚Äôs website, for example, if you visit the Friends of Hue section, you‚Äôll see that it works with all three voice assistants, even though the product box only has the HomeKit badge. Furthermore, the product page of Belkin‚Äôs WeMo smart outlet says that it works with Alexa and Google Assistant, even though it only mentions the Amazon Echo on the product‚Äôs packaging. View the Voice Assistants‚Äô Official Support Lists Somewhere on the voice assistants‚Äô official websites, you‚Äôll find a list of supported smarthome products. To save you some time and hassle, we‚Äôve tracked down each official support list from Amazon, Apple, and Google. Alexa/Echo‚Äôs Official Support List HomeKit/Siri‚Äôs Official Support List Google Assistant/Google Home‚Äôs Official Support List Sift through the list to see if your smarthome device is supported by your voice assistant of choice. If not, then you‚Äôre out of luck, but hopefully support will be added in the near future‚Äîvoice assistant‚Äôs are constantly adding more and more support for smarthome products. Read Reviews If all else fails, product reviews from retail websites can be extremely helpful when it comes to finding out which voice assistants are supported, as well as learn more about the product overall before you buy it. RELATED ARTICLE How to Spot Fake Reviews on Amazon, Yelp, and Other Sites Amazon even has a section for each product that allows customers to ask questions about the product and other customers can answer them. You can also search through questions to find what you‚Äôre looking for, specifically. For example, on the Ecobee3‚Äôs Amazon product page, I can search for ‚ÄúGoogle Home‚Äù and various questions about whether or not it‚Äôs supported will appear. From this, I can see that the Ecobee3 does not support the Google Home. However, be sure to look at when the question was asked and answered, because it might be out of date and it‚Äôs possible that the product has since added support for a particular voice assistant.

Getty Images Originally Published By: A tiny village in Norway has suddenly been swarmed with tourists thanks to a Google Maps error. Confused travelers, who thought they were about to experience the wonder of the famous Preikestolen cliff, have been turning up in Fossmork instead ‚Äî about 19 miles away from the path that leads to the iconic summit. Fossmork resident Helge Fossmark said there have been lines of minibusses lining up outside the village on summer days. ‚ÄúWe have sent hundreds of tourists away in no uncertainty that they‚Äôre on the wrong side of the fjord. In the summer season up to 10 to 15 cars show up each day,‚Äù Helge Fossmark told Norwegian newspaper Stavanger Aftenblad. Another village resident, Gunnar B√∏e, said that he is also visited by confused tourists. ‚ÄúWhen we are in the cabin, sometimes two, three, four or five tourists come in. Every day. They say they are going to Preikestolen and understand nothing. Google Maps leads them over the Lysefjord bridge and into Fossmork. The road here is quite narrow and they sometimes get quite upset when we tell them to go back,‚Äù B√∏e told the newspaper. Tourists and hikers the Preikestolen cliff.Getty Images ‚ÄúThey borrow a set of binoculars and can see all the people up on Preikestolen. It‚Äôs quite funny. We get to speak with Chinese and Japanese people, and there was an American that wanted to buy a cabin. He thought the place was fantastic.‚Äù Google has responded, saying it encourages people to report any problems they find so they can continue to improve the service. This isn‚Äôt the first time a tiny town in Europe has suddenly been flocked by tourists. The small English town of Kidlington, Oxfordshire became an unlikely tourist attraction last year for Chinese travelers, leaving the locals absolutely stumped at the time. Turns out, the tourists just wanted to get ‚Äúthe true sense‚Äù of England.

Everything from two screens, three cameras, stunning features and a durable design unlike any other LG smartphone released to date.¬†Here‚Äôs what we learned about it after a good 24 hours of usage. A full LG V10 review will take a lot of time, because this phone has so much going on. From a 5.7-inch Quad-HD display, a secondary 2.1-inch screen above it, three cameras, a fingerprint scanner, high-fi audio and tons of other things. LG decided to pack a little of everything into this high-end flagship smartphone. And we mean everything. Read: LG V10 Release Date Deals Emerge Earlier this year the LG G4 was released with a lot of praise and was one of LG‚Äôs best smartphones ever released. However, after just one or two days with the LG V10, I can already recommend it over the slightly smaller option outright. It‚Äôs nearly the same, but with tons of improvements across the board that makes it one compelling option. Even over the Galaxy Note 5, Google‚Äôs new Nexus 6P and many other big smartphones. The LG V10 is available from Verizon Wireless, AT&T and T-Mobile, with Sprint passing on the stunning smartphone. It has some of the best specs and features of any phone released in 2015, and is surely one users will want to look at before making a smartphone purchase. With that in mind, we wanted to share five or so things we learned after a little over 24 hours with the new LG V10 for potential buyers. Everything from the size, software, cameras, the new fingerprint scanner and second screen. It‚Äôs truly a unique phone. First we‚Äôll start off with the spec list for those interested, then get into a few things we like and don‚Äôt like about the phone for prospective buyers. LG V10 Specs 5.7-inch 2560 x 1440 Quad-HD Display 2.1-inch 160 x 1040 Second Screen 6-core Snapdragon 808 processor with 4GB of RAM 64GB of storage and a micro-SD slot for expansion 16 Megapixel f/1.8 Rear Camera, Laser auto-focus, OIS, more Two 5 megapixel front cameras for improved and wider ‚Äúselfies‚Äù Android 5.1.1 Lollipop Rear buttons and new Fingerprint scanner in power button 3,000 mAh removable battery Dura-Guard Steel Frame design 32 bit Hi-Fi audio The LG V10 has a regular 5.7-inch screen up front that looks nearly as good as anything else available. However, sitting above it is another 2.1-inch screen full of useful features, which we‚Äôll talk about in a moment. It might not have the latest 8-core processor or Android 6.0 Marshmallow, but it‚Äôs still a very powerful and capable device. One that‚Äôs just full of unique features that will wow buyers and impress friends. Now that the details are out of the way, here are a few things worth talking about after a day or so of using this thing. It‚Äôs Really Big LG‚Äôs new V10 smartphone is quite large, but at the same time, nothing that most users haven‚Äôt tried before. Having a 5.7-inch screen and then another 2.1-inch screen means it‚Äôll certainly be big. Slim bezels help out, too.¬†As a result it‚Äôs nearly the exact same size as the Galaxy Note 5, but slightly taller because of that second display. The LG V10 isn‚Äôt as tall as the Nexus 6P, and it‚Äôs not as wide as the Galaxy Note 4 or the Nexus 6 from last year. Meaning that while it‚Äôs big, it‚Äôs still easy to hold and use with one hand. They found the perfect balance in terms of size, mainly because of the thin bezels, and this phone is still very usable even though it‚Äôs quite large and has so much under the hood. It‚Äôs also pretty thick, and thicker than the Galaxy Note 5, even though mine has a slim TPU case on it. LG has been leading the smartphone market when it comes to the small bezels on the sides and top of their phones, and the same holds true here. There‚Äôs hardly any plastic on the top or bottom, and the front is nearly all screen, which is a good thing. It looks great, feels even better in the hand, and is easy to use with one hand. That‚Äôs the important thing. Looks and Design While this phone may not be the prettiest or win any awards for the design, everything has a purpose. LG employed a new metal ‚Äúdura-guard‚Äù steel frame around the entire device on the inside, and the outside. As a result the sides have a very comfortable yet durable aluminum framing in case it‚Äôs dropped. It also comes in five beautiful colors, rather than the typical boring Black or White, and the Aqua Blue model I have here looks very fun, playful, and again, unique. This phone is unlike anything else available. For better or for worse. Then around back we have the familiar LG layout with the buttons on back. This helps the sides be small with no bezels as they don‚Äôt have to place buttons there like most. Instead around back is the power button with a built-in fingerprint scanner, volume up/down keys, and that impressive 16 megapixel camera that‚Äôs color-coated to the design. There‚Äôs a two-stage dual LED flash, and LG‚Äôs popular laser autofocus. It has a very industrial look on the back with an odd texture, but that also helps make it extremely easy to hold. It isn‚Äôt slippery, and users won‚Äôt be dropping it like the Note 5. While we‚Äôre on the design, it has a removable 3,000 mAh quick charging battery and a micro-SD slot for expanding storage. Something many look for in a smartphone ever since Samsung abandoned those features in 2015. Fingerprint Scanner This is one of LG‚Äôs first smartphones to have a fingerprint scanner, which is a growing trend in smartphones. Everything from the iPhone, Samsung‚Äôs lineup, HTC‚Äôs new One A9, to even Google‚Äôs Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P all have them. It‚Äôs built right into the rear home button that LG users are familiar with, but sadly it doesn‚Äôt work very well. I‚Äôve had the pleasure of trying almost every phone released over the past 4-5 years, and every one that has a fingerprint scanner. In 2015 though, many excellent options are available. The Nexus 6P is the fastest and easiest to setup and use, and the most accurate. Samsung is on par with Apple, according to who you talk to, and HTC‚Äôs fingerprint scanner is average at best. Sadly, the LG V10 has one of the worst fingerprint scanners I‚Äôve tried in 2015. Maybe it‚Äôs my unit, maybe I need to try again, but it doesn‚Äôt work nearly as seamless, and it isn‚Äôt very accurate either. It‚Äôs a pretty bad effort. If you were planning on buying the LG V10 simply for the fingerprint scanner, don‚Äôt. It still has plenty to offer that makes it an excellent smartphone, but the fingerprint scanner is just one piece of the puzzle. It took nearly 3x as long as Google‚Äôs phones to setup and add a finger, I had constant errors, and it isn‚Äôt as accurate. Then this last part can be a pro or a con. The Nexus fingerprint scanner works just by touching it even while the screen is off, as does Samsung‚Äôs. With the LG G4, you have to click the home button. This turns on the screen, scans your print, and unlocks the phone at once. It isn‚Äôt as accurate, easy to use, or as fast as Samsung or Google‚Äôs method. It‚Äôs still good, but not the best. The LG V10 fingerprint scanner still delivers more security, a better Android Pay experience, and will likely get better with Android 6.0 Marshmallow, but so far it‚Äôs average at best. Second Screen My favorite aspect of the device, aside from our last category, is the second screen on the top. We‚Äôve seen this idea fail in the past, and at first it seemed like nothing more than a gimmick, but the more I use the LG V10 the more I enjoy it. Like all LG phones, the V10 is highly customizable. From the on-screen keys, colors, settings menu and more, and now they have an even more customizable second display above the main screen. It can be set to always on, turned off, or activated with a tap just like a regular screen. While the phone lies dormant on my desk not being used it sits in a low-power state displaying the time, date and battery, and a swipe to the left offers quick access (all in that low-power state) to volume controls, WiFi, the flashlight toggle, camera and more. Meaning users don‚Äôt even have to turn on the phone to see the time, take a photo with the already great and fast camera, or turn on the flashlight. Then with the LG V10 turned on the second screen comes to life. Some of the features are pointless and redundant, like quick access to apps that are already on the homescreen, but others, are very helpful. You can customize the message, we have our Twitter account, and a swipe over brings up pre-set customized apps, and another swipe are recently used apps. This makes opening favorite or recent apps easy, but Android already does this well. Of course this can be done on the homescreen, but it offers another level of functionality most don‚Äôt. Except for maybe the Galaxy S6 Edge. It‚Äôs a neat concept that hopefully more apps can tap into with developers doing fun things. Thankfully though, almost every app installed on the phone can be shown on the secondary 2.1-inch display, instead of a select few, so that‚Äôs a nice change. Samsung only allows certain apps on the ‚Äúedge‚Äù. At first I figured it would just be a pointless gimmick, but the more I use the LG V10, the more I find myself instantly launching the flashlight, opening my favorite games, or messing with that second screen just because I can. We don‚Äôt need it, but it‚Äôs nice to have. Users are going to like it. Battery Life & Cameras And finally, we have battery life and the cameras. This phone has the same 3,000 mAh battery as the LG G4, but it has to power a bigger screen and more features. So far it held up through an entire day of heavy usage pretty well, but we‚Äôll need more testing. It does have quick charging, so that‚Äôs a plus. It went from 0-48% in just 26 minutes. The cameras are pretty nice. It has the same 16 megapixel F/1.8 camera with laser autofocus and image stabilization as the G4, which is in the top five for best smartphones cameras. On front however, there are two 5 megapixel cameras for improved wide-angle selfie photos. In real life, the dual front cameras make a huge difference. Images are extremely crisp and clear, and it has a wider angle to fit more in. A group of 10 could take a selfie with ease. Something no other phone can do this quickly and easily. Final Thoughts There are so many things about this phone we‚Äôll need to dig through, that a full review will be coming later. For now though, it has been a pretty excellent experience. The LG V10 is extremely fast, fluid, and stable. The software is better than the LG G4 too. The custom skin over Android 5.1.1 Lollipop is paired down, simple, and fast. I‚Äôve never been a fan of custom skins, but LG has slowly but surely made theirs into a great experience. It‚Äôs fast, user friendly, customizable, and it looks pretty good too. The LG V10 is one of the most capable, unique, powerful and durable phones on the market. We‚Äôll need a lot more time with it, but so far we‚Äôre impressed with everything on the surface. Aside from the average at best fingerprint scanner around back. Try one at a carrier store today, buyers might just like what they see. 30 Responses 11/14/2015 Jon Reply The fingerprint scanner works flawlessly without a case on the phone. Which I see you said you had a TPU case. In order for it to work flawlessly, your skin has to touch the metal on the side along with the metal around the power button. The case doesn‚Äôt allow this to happen. Although I do believe it should work with a case regardless, and it does take forever to set up. But without a case, it works instantly, and I agree with you and countless others. I wish you could just touch the scanner and it open the phone, not push the button, wait for it to come on, then scan your finger 11/15/2015 Jason Reply I was going to say the same thing that Jon said. You indicated that you have a case on your phone and according to several posts that I have read, you have to be touching the metal sides for the fingerprint scanner to work. But when you do, it is super fast and incredibly accurate. Unless, perhaps, you had a defective fingerprint scanner on your device. But give it a try and let us know by an update. It is still an annoyance, because a lot of us like our expensive phones to be protected. My case has a lanyard hole, and if you put a little piece of aluminum foil through it, then it works, as long as you are touching the foil, and the foil is touching the side of the phone. And I also agree that you shouldn‚Äôt have to press the power button first, it should just be able to scan when your finger rests on the scanner. But I can work with it, no problem. I love this phone so far. 11/16/2015 Manny Reply Exactly what Jon said. My Fingerprint scanner works GREAT! Although I don‚Äôt have a case on it. I did buy a case but decided not to use it on a regular basis. This phone is to gorgeous to cover it with a case. I did however put a Tempered Glass screen shield on it. 11/30/2015 Scott Reply If you have a case on the phone. Reinput your fingerprints while the case is on, an I have no issue with mine 11/17/2015 Ads Reply http://www.newgrounds.com/audio/listen/653873 11/18/2015 Cory Gunther Reply I have a TPU case on my Note 5, which I mentioned while comparing the size of the LG V10. That‚Äôs where you guys saw that I have a case. My LG V10 does not have a case, and the fingerprint scanner still struggles. If you have to place your finger perfectly, and hit the button AND metal, as you guys suggest, that‚Äôs not a good implementation. The Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, Galaxy Note 5 and iPhone all have a better fingerprint scanner. In my opinion. I deleted and re-saved my fingerprint, and it still isn‚Äôt as good as I‚Äôd like, but did work a little better this time around. Thanks for the replies. 11/19/2015 Zotz Reply AT&T pushed an update on 11/18 to the V10 which fixed the fingerprint scanner, among other little things. The FPS now works quickly and flawlessly ‚Äì without touching the metal side rails, and with a case (mine is a Ringke plastic/TPU). 11/19/2015 Kevin d Reply The finger print scanner is the fastest and most flawless one I tried in 2015 and that‚Äôs with using a tpu case. Yes the nexus 6p is fast but the appearance is what gets to you. Nexus 5x, I didn‚Äôt even turn it on. It felt like a play school toy phone that my 2 year old daughter would have loved. One plus 2, more and more bugs everyday and with a finger print scanner that rarely work while charging. The note 5 and the s6 edge plus had great screens but when you see it in the Sun while off, you see separation as if moisture is in there. As for iPhone 6 and 6s, if you wash dishes, the finger scanner does not work. So far the lg v10 is by far the best of 2015 that I have tested. But there is one flaw. The camera was misaligned where it was dropped south west. I went back to best buy to exchange and 3 other ones were similar but not as bad. Then there were 2 left, 1 was pushed to the west and then that last box, it was dead center. 11/20/2015 AceSalman Reply Do do you think guys about this Mobile Good/Very Good/Perfect/Excellent 11/27/2015 john Reply excellent 12/08/2015 TP Reply Why is TMobile ONLY carrying the black; not white/blue? 12/12/2015 Sarah Reply Amazing phone love it!! 12/12/2015 Steelreign Reply I‚Äôm definitely going to get the V10. I currently have the Note 4, but since the Note 5 went away from the removable battery and SD card slot, I‚Äôm making the switch. 12/15/2015 Rob Reply Why no one mentions the volume I think the battery is good for the power but the volume is my only issue do you think a update would fix it 12/19/2015 Damon Reply I need help I‚Äôm having an issue with my front camera I have it at 16:9 but the camera screen is so small I don‚Äôt know how to fix it it worked fine the first day didn‚Äôt move much for it to have done this can anyone help? 12/21/2015 Manny Subia (MannyLegacy) Reply Hi Damon,‚Ä¶‚Ä¶When you say that your Camera Screen is so small,‚Ä¶‚Ä¶what exactly do you mean? Just so I understand correctly. When you are using the front facing camera, you‚Äôre saying that the screen (that shows what the picture will be) is small??‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ I have a feeling that you might have turned on the ‚ÄúFlash‚Äù for the front camera. When this is done there will be a large white border around the screen and in turn the screen is much smaller to accommodate the border. This is used to add light to any front facing camera pics. If you turn off the Flash then that large white border will go away and the preview screen will appear full sized again. Hope that helps you. 12/23/2015 Teri Reply I am having intermittent issues with the soft key at the top of the phone. My inbox defaults on email but I am unable to go back to the folder page. 01/01/2016 Ed Reply I‚Äôm having the same problem. The soft key on the upper left area that allows you to select menu options in all apps suddenly stops working. Please LG, fix that! 01/17/2016 Diana Reply I love my lg v10 and camera andbig screen etc but volume especially in incoming calls should be louder my friends keep telling me they cannot hear me.. Lgv10 please fix 02/15/2016 Danielle Reply Has anyone ever had a problem with the phone being on loud, and it randomly makes it turn to vibrate? This is my second lgv10, and it still says it‚Äôs on loud, but will not ring it only vibrates. 02/17/2016 Leah Reply Mine is doing the same thing, but not just randomly, but constantly. I have the volume turned completely up, went through all of my settings and double checked everything, and it still won‚Äôt ring, only vibrate. My alarm is working, but no ring. Any help or suggestions would be really appreciated. 02/17/2016 Danielle Reply this is killing me! I have gone through 2 phones. I‚Äôm about to go get my third. But I can‚Äôt see it solving anything if the first 2 were buggy. Do you have the blue or the black one? 02/29/2016 Mariah Reply Does your calls keep dropping on the phone? Mine does. I‚Äôve had T-Mobile for years and never a dropped call until this LGV10 03/20/2016 Marsha Reply Help please‚Ä¶.I have had this phone for less than a month and I can no longer ‚Äúsend‚Äù text messages. I used to be able to send but now can only receive. I went to Verizon store and spent an hour with the guy who send over everything and bcould not figure out why I can receive texts but can‚Äôt send texts. Please help. 04/01/2016 jose pekholtz Reply there are some down sides about this bad boy v10, the emoticons (emojis) are not the whatsapp standard but some weird clones, for a 700$ phone you would expect better sound‚Ä¶ the sound on the blu studio energy 2 is better and louder, the battery does not last a day of use, and the phone came out just as some improvements were made to the OS, they should have waited to release the phone with the latest version (marshmallow) instead of the lollipop, (not a clue if LG will upgrade it on the v10) and also the fast charging 3.0 is now available whereas the LGv10 has only 2.0 04/05/2016 Joel Reply Just got the V10 this week. Seems the battery is used up before the end the day. I do some streaming on Pandora. Other wise emails, messages and calls. Anybody experiencing the same thing. Do u think I might have a defective battery. Got the phone from Assurion and they promised it was a brand new phone not refurbished. Did not use the phone till about 5 pm today and it is down 49% by 6:40 Pm after some phone calls and messages. 04/09/2016 Douglas Doolittle Reply Well V10 players I also have one and it‚Äôs doing just great. But I did have a protected screen added to my phone at the purchase of it. That was only since the end of Feburary. It started to separate the layers of the material that was used. After it covered a third of the screen I took it off. If they make the protected layer over the screen better I might get another. 06/30/2016 Debbie Reply My V10 won‚Äôt focus on anything, no matter how many times I tap the screen. Any suggestions?? 07/21/2016 RonDon Reply My second screen isn‚Äôt working, neither is my home or recent buttons. The back button works perfectly fine though. Any suggestions? 05/05/2017 Mika Hakkinen Reply Marketing-driven, like so many products. Overkill on screen resolution wastes energy Overkill on photo size/resolution makes it impossible to email No adjustment permitted for latter which is ridiculous Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published.

Reuters/ Lucy Nicholson Mother‚Äôs Day is on May 14 and a lot of folks are likely looking for gifts or planning something special for their moms. Google tries to help out with a special Mother‚Äôs Day Photos app, a costless alternative that aims to brighten any mom‚Äôs day.¬† Using apps to brighten mom‚Äôs day isn‚Äôt exactly new. It is a practice done on most occasions with photos being the main ingredient. Hence, for the Google Mother‚Äôs Day app to function properly, having an ample supply of photos of your mom on your account will be needed. For those who want to upload their pictures to Google Photos, you can do so here. The Google Mother‚Äôs Day app is available for both iOS and Android. One just needs to sync their photos where the facial recognition would carry on and produce the movie which would last 45-seconds. A corresponding heartwarming and/or sweet track will be added to compliment the photos selected ‚Äì pretty much similar to how Facebook does it with their friendship anniversary clips.¬† The extra effort could be a bane for some but looms a better recourse than the automated route. The latter would make Google pick the photos ‚Äì something most know will likely be unreliable according to Engadget. Folks can view the clip before sending it via the Assistant screen, something that can be saved or shared. The Google Mother‚Äôs Day Photo app may not be much but can brighten the day of any mom. Some may use it as their actual gift while others could simply go through a little effort to honor their mom outside the traditional gifts and plans ahead.¬† Speaking of Mother‚Äôs Day gifts, flowers and cakes are expected to be the ones given away. Some will treat their mom out or even try to whip up something like giving mom a special meal like breakfast in bed.¬† Handing out gifts will be appreciated but moms will likely appreciate something unique. It doesn‚Äôt have to be tangible for those short on budget. Doing the usual chores mom‚Äôs do would go a long way with the intent of giving them a break at least for one day ‚Äì which is May 14.¬† Mom‚Äôs do have their roles, both working and housewives. Mother‚Äôs Day only comes once a year. Hence, whether it be through gifts or a simple Google Mother‚Äôs Day video, expect your mom to appreciate and love the effort. A sample clip of what the Google App can do can be seen below.

It seems even offline retailers are getting in on the discount brigade now, promising Rs 13000 in cashback. This Google Pixel cashback is valid till May 31 on cash, debit card, and credit card transactions, including EMI purchases. The sum gets deposited to your account within 90 days of the sale in the case of the last two. This time constraint naturally isn‚Äôt there if you‚Äôre paying via cash of course, so the Rs 13000 cashback is effectively an instant discount. The banks eligible for the Pixel deal are HDFC Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, RBL, HSBC, Indusind Bank, Standard Chartered Bank, Yes Bank, UBI, ICICI Bank, Axis Bank, and Citibank. Note that only one transaction is allowed per card till the end of the offer period. Also See: Google announces last dates for Pixel, Nexus security updates Flipkart is currently offering a Rs 13000 flat cut of its own for all credit and debit cards, in addition to up to Rs 20000 off upon exchange. Cutting out that much from the cost of the Pixel translates to it coming down to Rs 44000 (32GB) and Rs 53000 (128GB). The Pixel XL effectively falls down to Rs 54000 (32GB) and Rs 63000 (128GB). Common specifications of the Google Pixel and Pixel XL: ‚Äì Display: 5-inch FHD/5.5-inch QHD ‚Äì OS: Android 7.1 Nougat ‚Äì Storage: 32GB/128GB ‚Äì RAM: 4GB ‚Äì CPU: quad-core Snapdragon 821 ‚Äì Camera: 12.3MP rear, 8MP front ‚Äì Battery: 2770mAh/3450mAh ‚Äì Connectivity: 4G, Wi-Fiac, Bluetooth 4.2, USB Type-C, NFC, GPS A prominent retailer apparently told Gadgets 360 that many offline shops are burdened with unsold inventory of the Pixel. The new scheme is meant to get these units into the hands of consumers without having to officially announce a price cut.

At the time, Google noted that it was focusing on Android Pay and it now appears that¬†elements of Hands Free are beginning to appear‚Ä¶ Nintendo Switch About APK Teardowns: In this ‚ÄòAPK teardown,‚Äô we‚Äôve decompiled the latest version of an application that was uploaded to the Play Store. When an app (or an APK, to be specific, in the case of Android apps) is decompiled, we‚Äôre able to see various lines of code within that hint at possible future features. Keep in mind that Google may or may not ever ship these features, and our interpretation of what they are may be imperfect. With that in mind, read on. Version 1.22 of Android Pay includes¬†several strings referring to a feature known as Visual ID.¬†It will only be used to authenticate loyalty programs at retailers and not to make payments. <string name=‚Äùhandsfree_consent_subtitle‚Äù>Visual ID is a secure way to confirm your identity at participating stores, making it easier to do things like earn loyalty points and redeem rewards.</string> The feature leverages facial recognition, with users creating a face template during set-up. At participating stores, a Visual ID camera will snap a picture and compare the stored model¬†to authenticate users. On the privacy front, Google notes that stores cannot access the taken images, with the photo deleted shortly after they are captured. <string name=‚Äùhandsfree_consent_text_identity_text‚Äù>‚ÄúGoogle creates and stores a face template based on the photo you save during setup. When you‚Äôre at a participating store, Visual ID will automatically confirm your identity using facial recognition technology (your face template is compared to the image captured by the in-store Visual ID camera). Images captured by the in-store Visual ID camera can‚Äôt be accessed by the store and are deleted shortly after they‚Äôre captured. They‚Äôre not stored or saved.‚Äù</string> After a confirmation, Google will send loyalty information to the store. Bluetooth will also be used to detect your location at a store. <string name=‚Äùhandsfree_consent_text_location_text‚Äù>Visual ID uses Bluetooth and other signals from your phone to detect your location.</string> <string name=‚Äùhandsfree_consent_text_privacy_text‚Äù>When Visual ID confirms your identity, Google sends your loyalty info to the store, but does not share any other info about you. You can turn Visual ID off at any time by changing your Android Pay settings.</string> While Visual ID in its current state¬†is not as useful as Hands Free, it‚Äôs likely just a starting point for Google to widely¬†test out the technology.

But the fact is that your Google Analytics data and your Facebook data will never match entirely. Why is this? The only way to accurately measure your Facebook data is through Facebook reporting itself - here are some key reporting notes on the variations between the two, why they exist, and what you need to watch for. 1. Cross Device Conversions In this day and age, people use multiple devices throughout the user journey before a¬†purchase is made - it takes multiple touch points, and this happens across multiple devices.¬† For example, suppose you‚Äôre out and about and start browsing on your mobile device. You click on an ad but don‚Äôt convert, but then¬†later that day, you‚Äôre sitting at your desktop computer and you decide to jump onto that company‚Äôs website to buy the product you saw earlier. Google Analytics would fail to attribute that conversion back to the initial click on your mobile device, and would¬†subsequently under-report your results. Facebook, on the other hand, has the unique ability to track conversions back to users instead of cookies. This means you can track the same user across all devices as long as they‚Äôre logged into their Facebook account. By¬†comparison, Google Analytics relies on cookies, meaning all the tracking happens exactly on the browser where the cookie was dropped. 2. Impressions and Clicks Google Analytics uses cookies to track users on a website, and doesn‚Äôt have the ability to track impressions like Facebook. If cookies aren‚Äôt enabled, you won‚Äôt be able to track those users through GA. With Google Analytics, it‚Äôs considered a conversion when a user clicks the intended link within the ad, whereas with Facebook, a user can click any portion of the ad, convert, and still be tracked as a conversion. If a user clears their cookies, all of that data will remain in¬†Google Analytics. In Facebook, however, this data is cleared from your custom audiences. It‚Äôs also good to note that Google Analytics back-dates data, while Facebook collects the data from the day your audiences are set up. 3. Clicks vs. Sessions This one is always a cause for concern with marketers: ‚ÄúWait, my clicks in Facebook don‚Äôt match my sessions reported in Google Analytics? Why?‚Äù There are several reasons for this discrepancy. If a user clicks your Facebook post more than once in a 30-minute window, Google Analytics only tracks this as one session. Conversely, Facebook considers this as more than one click. (i.e., one Google Analytics session and two Facebook clicks). If a user clicks your Facebook post and visits your website, becomes inactive for more than 30 minutes, and then re-engages with your site¬†after¬†30 minutes, Google will records two separate sessions. Facebook reports only the single click. In this case, one Facebook click equals two sessions. If a user accidentally clicks your Facebook ad but jumps off quickly, Google Analytics will most likely not have had the chance to record this click, since the page hadn‚Äôt loaded fully. 4. UTM Parameters Google Analytics uses referrer URLs to credit conversions back to ads. Facebook users browse Facebook using ‚Äòhttps‚Äô instead of ‚Äòhttp‚Äô. So, if a user clicks an ad in Facebook and leaves to convert on an http website, the user can‚Äôt be recorded since they have left a secure environment. This, again, will lead to under-reporting of conversions. 5. Multiple Conversions This is an important one to note - Google Analytics only allows a one-per-click attribution, meaning only one conversion is counted regardless of the number of conversions that actually happened. If a user saw or clicked an ad and converted multiple times, Facebook attributes multiple conversions to the ad last clicked or viewed. 6. Attribution Window Facebook conversion measurement attributes conversions based on a 24-hour view and 28-day click-through window - so, any comparison you do against other tracking data must compare exactly the same attribution window. Google Analytics uses the last interaction model, which attributes 100% of the conversion value to the last channel the customer interacted with before buying or converting. To update your attribution window in Facebook, click¬†Customize Columns¬†and choose the window that best suits your needs. 7. Conversion Date Facebook reports on the time of a view or click of the conversion, whereas third party tracking tools often report on the time of conversion. 8. Ad Blocker Software Your conversion pixel may not fire if the user has an ad blocker installed in the browser. This will cause undercounting conversions, so the number may be lower than your internal data. These are some of the key reasons you're seeing discrepancies in your Facebook Insights and Google Analytics data, and it's important to understand these variations to ensure your data is correct and that you're tracking the correct info. When you do note any discrepancies, make sure you trace back the details and confirm the various source points, using this list as a reference, to help ensure the validity of your info.

Now that Android Wear¬†is becoming a more mature platform, mostly thanks to the long-awaited 2.0 update, we're starting to see more watches than ever hit the market. It was fairly easy to compare Android Wear watches in years past - only a handful of tech companies even bothered. But now, a vast amount of wearables are being released, with most of them by actual watch companies. So how do they all stack up? You may notice some missing information below, especially from Fossil. We tried multiple times to reach out to Fossil for information on its upcoming watches, but we didn't receive a response. At a glance We've compiled a massive table¬†comparing every watch.¬†You can also look at it on Google Docs.

It's definitely one of the most feature-packed watches on the market, supporting every feature the OS does. It works with¬†Wi-Fi, LTE, NFC, and GPS - and includes a heart rate sensor and a speaker. As far as specifications go, it has a Snapdragon Wear 2100 CPU, a 480x480 1.38" circular display, IP68 water resistance, and a 430mAh battery. Unfortunately, battery life isn't fantastic, especially if you need to use LTE often. Be sure to check out our full review for more details, and you can buy it now from various retailers for $349. LG Watch Style Just like the Watch Sport, this was developed by LG and Google as an Android Wear 2.0 launch device.¬†The Style is much thinner than the Sport, but at the cost of features and battery life. It lacks NFC, LTE, GPS, and a heart rate sensor. The battery capacity is just 240mAh, which should only get you through a day of use (if that). The Style has a Wear 2100 processor, a round 1.2" 360x360 display, and IP67 water resistance. You can find our full review here, and if you want to buy one for yourself, it will cost you $249. Casio Pro Trek WSD-F20 If you need a super rugged Android Wear device, the WSD-F20 may be for you. Casio announced the watch back in January, and it just recently went on sale for a whopping $500. For that price, you're getting a speaker, Wi-Fi and GPS connectivity, and a 1.32" 320x300 display. However,¬†the WSD-F20 is missing quite a few important features. It doesn't have a heart rate sensor, NFC, or LTE. Also, it is one of the few 2017 Android Wear watches with a flat tire display. New Balance RunIQ New Balance released its first Android Wear watch earlier this year, the RunIQ. As you might guess, the RunIQ is primarily designed for workouts. It's powered by an Intel Atom Z34XX processor and includes Wi-Fi and GPS connectivity, a 1.39" 400x400 circular display, a 410mAh battery, and 5ATM water resistance. Unfortunately, the RunIQ lacks NFC for Android Pay, as well as LTE connectivity and a speaker. It's currently priced at $299. Huawei Watch 2 Why, Huawei? You were the chosen one! After the original Huawei Watch ended up being one of the best Android Wear devices on the market, many were excited for a newer model. Unfortunately, what Huawei provided was subjectively worse than the original - you can find our full review here. If you're still interested, the Huawei Watch 2 has a 1.2" 390x390 circular display, a 420mAh battery, IP67 water resistance, and all the connectivity and sensors you could want (including LTE). It's currently on sale for around $299, depending on the retailer. Huawei Watch 2 Classic The 'Classic' variant of the Huawei Watch 2 is probably closer to what most people were hoping for. It has almost exactly the same specifications as the normal Watch 2 - a Wear 2100 CPU, 1.2" 390x390 display, 420mAh battery, IP67 water resistance. However, it lacks the Wear 2's LTE support. The Watch 2 Classic is also $70 more expensive than the normal model, and shares many of its faults - small screen, no digital crown, etc. It's currently priced at $369 at most retailers. TAG Heuer Connected Modular 45 The award for the longest smartwatch name goes to the TAG Heuer Connected Modular 45. This watch has¬†an Intel Atom Z34XX processor (the same one the Casio watch uses), 1.39" 400x400 circular display, 410mAh battery, and speaker. As far as connectivity and sensors, it has¬†Wi-Fi, GPS, and NFC for Android Pay. It does not have a heart rate sensor or LTE. The Connected Modular 45 also wins the award for most expensive smartwatch on this list - you'll be shelling out $1,650 for the privilege of owning one. Montblanc Summit Similar to the TAG Huer, the Montblanc Summit is another luxury smartwatch. It has a Snapdragon Wear 2100 CPU, 1.39" 400x400 circular display, heart rate sensor, 300mAh battery, and IP68 water resistance. Unfortunately, the Summit is a bit light on functionality. It doesn't have NFC, LTE, GPS, or a speaker. Whether¬†or not that matters is up to you, but I expect the $890 starting price will drive most normal people away. GUESS Connect (2017) GUESS has made hybrid smartwatches with dot-matrix displays in the past, but this year, the company¬†released a proper Android Wear watch. It's available in two sizes - a 41mm for women (left) and a 44mm for men (right). The GUESS Connect has¬†a Snapdragon Wear 2100 processor but lacks NFC, LTE, GPS, and a heart rate sensor. The watch is expected to be released in Fall or Winter 2017 and will start at $300. Michael Kors Access¬†Grayson/Sofie Michael Kors announced two very similar Android Wear watches earlier this year, the Access Grayson (left) and Access Sofie (right). The Grayson looks more like a traditional men's watch, with an AMOLED display and a digital crown. It will be available in gold, stainless steel, and blue/black. The Sofie is primarily targeted at women, with a thinner case and a lighter feel than the Grayson. It has the same AMOLED display, but sadly¬†lacks a digital crown. It will have eight plating/bracelet combinations and seven interchangeable strap options. Both watches have a Snapdragon Wear 2100 processor and will start at $350. Misfit Vapor There are plenty of expensive products¬†on this list, but if you're looking for a good value smartwatch, the Misfit Vapor might be the best choice. It's¬†the second-cheapest Android Wear device on this list, at just $199, but it has¬†a Wear 2100 processor, a 1.39" circular display, water resistance up to 50 meters, Wi-Fi, GPS, and a heart rate sensor. However, I was unable to find confirmation that the Vapor included a speaker. Design-wise, the Misfit Vapor is definitely one of my favorites. It has a similar design to the Moto 360, but with a small bezel surrounding the screen instead of the 360's flat tire. It will launch in "Late Summer 2017." Diesel On Diesel's first Android Wear watch, the Diesel On, was announced earlier this year at Baselworld 2017. Hardly any useful information about it has been revealed, besides the fact that it uses a Snapdragon Wear 2100 processor and will have "hundreds of customization options." It looks like it has a digital crown, but we can't be sure. The watch will be available in "Holiday 2017," and will start at $350. Fossil Q Venture/Q Explorist Fossil's first Android Wear watch was released back in 2015, and the company followed up on it with two more in 2016. This year, Fossil is releasing the Q Venture and Q Explorist. Details on these are also incredibly sparse, but we do know both watches will have a Snapdragon Wear 2100 CPU and will be released in the Fall. It seems very likely that both watches have a flat tire display, as companies often try to use black watch faces in promotional material (such as the above image) to hide it. In fact, adjusting the brightness and contrast on the above image does reveal a flat tire. Movado Connect Movado's first Android Wear device, the Movado Connect, definitely looks sleek. It has an edge-to-edge 1.46" 400x400 circular display, a 300mAh battery, Wi-Fi connectivity, and NFC for Android Pay. However, it is worth noting that the Connect lacks a speaker, LTE, GPS, and a heart rate sensor. The watch will be available in Fall 2017, starting at $495. Hugo Boss Touch Another sleek Android Wear watch announced this year is the Hugo Boss Touch, priced at $395.¬†The specifications are identical to the Movado Connect - Wear 2100 CPU, 300mAh battery, 1.46" 400x400 circular display, and Wi-Fi/NFC connectivity. Just like the Connect, it's missing a speaker, LTE, GPS, and a heart rate sensor. You'll be able to buy it this Fall. Tommy Hilfiger TH24/7You This watch wins the award for the worst smartwatch name, but it seems to be pretty good at everything else. It has a Wear 2100 processor, a 1.4" circular 400x400 display, and a 300mAh battery. The watch does have Wi-Fi and NFC support, but lacks a speaker, LTE, GPS, and a heart rate sensor. You'll be able to buy the TH24/7You in the Fall for $299 - making it one of the more competitively-priced options on this list. ZTE Quartz At $192, the ZTE Quartz is¬†the least expensive watch on this list, barely beating out the Misfit Vapor. Currently exclusive to T-Mobile, the Quartz has a Wear 2100 CPU, 1.4" 400x400 circular display, and IP67 water resistance. It supports Wi-Fi, 3G, and GPS connectivity, but no NFC. There's also no heart rate sensor on the Quartz, but it does have the largest battery of any watch on this list at 500mAh. The carrier exclusivity is a bit of a bummer, but maybe we'll see an unlocked model show up in the future. Verizon Wear24 Verizon surprised everyone when it announced an LTE-capable Android Wear watch alongside the LG Watch Sport, undercutting the latter device in the process. The Wear24 has all the features of the Watch Sport, except GPS and a heart rate sensor (and possibly a speaker, Verizon hasn't confirmed that). When the Wear24 goes on sale, you'll be able to buy it for $349 outright or $300 on a two-year contract. It also remains to be seen how bulky the watch will be - that was definitely a problem for the Watch Sport, and Verizon hasn't released any photos. Conclusion We're starting to see more and more actual watch companies invest in Android Wear, which I see as a good thing for the platform.¬†Up until now, Android Wear has largely only been used by tech enthusiasts. I've seen plenty of people with Apple Watches (not as many as Apple would like, but still), but hardly anyone with Android Wear devices. Android Wear 2.0 in general is a bit of a mixed bag. While I personally don't mind the changes as much, others are much less happy about it, and for valid reasons. We'll have to see where the platform goes in the coming months (and years), but there is no shortage of watches to choose from.

Such a shame. Corbin Davenport That one was released in 2016. Dimitris Kanellopoulos Right. Sorry Raven ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà It might also have been released late 2016, but it is a shame that you did not include the Asus ZenWatch 3 in this comparison. I think it is one of the best Wear 2100 based smart watches currently available and at only $209 it is a steal compared to some of the ones listed here. I am loving mine. Tucker Sferro scrolling down the list, I am amazed at the prices. I loved my Moto 360 1st gen, I paid $100 for it on Craigslist. That's exactly what it's worth. You know why? The battery died after about 18 months and it's now a brick. The general public doesnt want to pay more than $150 for a secondary "cell phone-like" piece of hardware that only lasts 2 years, period. Smartwatches will NEVER take off until the cost point drops dramatically. This is the same thing that e-readers went through, until Amazon stepped up to the plate and brought the costs dow. Thomas Paulsen A fellow Moto 360 1st gen user here with a dead battery. I paid top dollar and it burned me so much that I am holding back from another purchase. The only reasons that I would reconsider are being able to open smart locks with NFC, robust assistant voice control ("open garage door"), broader Android Pay availability and - of course - a moderate price because we all know gadgets become obsolete fast. Tucker Sferro I found an article online that shows you how to replace the battery ($15), but it involved cracking the plastic off the back of the 360, etc. I would also be unhappy if I paid full price. Thomas Paulsen This video was posted two months ago and details the battery swap: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1as_h5jnBM Lazyboy0172 Oh I am going to be very sad when my battery dies. I've had my 360 since september 2014 and have no battery problems so far, but I'll be very sad to lose it. That's really the only thing that will get me to replace it though, because right now the thought of spending $300+ on something newer with the only real difference being that it looks better does not make sense to me. And I think that's the problem with the market right now- the price points just aren't there between manufacturers and consumers. Consumers do not want to supplement their $500 phone with a $400 watch, and then have to replace that watch every couple years. But no manufacturer can afford to sell a nice looking watch at <$150 and then also not have any repeat customers for 3+ years. Tucker Sferro you bring up a good point, that manufacturers are unable to bring the costs down to a more attractive level, which is why someone like Amazon (shudders) might be able to lower the cost with a Fire watch, or something like that. Oh boy, ads on my watch?! I just threw up on myself. brkshr Replacing the battery costs about $10 and 20 minutes. Kyle R Krcmaric I just want to have Android Wear at or below $150 on a device that supports Android Pay. GreatNews You forgot to include the all new ZTE Quartz https://www.t-mobile.com/internet-device/zte-quartz Corbin Davenport You're right, I'll be adding it shortly. Rorison Meadows II I need a camera on a decent sized one for video calling and photos. Come on people! marcusmarcus2 Here you go :) http://www.doki.com/ Daniel Nava Best Buy has the LG Watch Style for $170 right now. I picked one up and could not be happier with it. I just wanted a nice looking basic Android Wear watch under $200 and I got it. Matt It's a shame that Wear 2.0 is so bad. Roy ?WHY kamiller42 Oh. Where do I begin? 1. The watch is no longer an extension of the phone. This hurts the convenience of using the watch. 2. Apps that used to work no longer. Most times, permissions have to be granted again. Other times, the watch app has lost connectivity with the phone. 3. Notifications which used to appear don't. 4. It's slower than previous versions. 5. Theater mode in 1 click, 1 swipe, and 2 taps vs 2 clicks. 6. DnD no longer works. Why? Because Google wants the watch to act as an independent device. DnD on watch and phone are not connected. A handful of people say that's great, but the situations they bring up are edge cases. Most people, when they say "Do not disturb me" means do not disturb me at all. 7. I have not figured out to answer the phone from the watch. The only option I see is to refuse call. Used to be simple. Swipe right to answer. Swipe left to refuse. Roy 1. It's great. Only need good sync. 2. Wich apps? 3. Why not? All the reviews says it's work. 4. Mmm for sure now they need to upgrade the hardware for independent os. 5. What's for? 6. You right about that. 7. I didn't hear about that. So if I can Make a summary no everything work flawless so it's good that I didn't buy one just yet but it doesn't mean that Android Wear 2.0 not in good Direction. I hated the first version. Matt Why is that a shame or why is it bad? Michael Maggard ZTE Quartz came out in 2017, has Android Wear 2.0, and is under US$200. https://www.t-mobile.com/internet-device/zte-quartz Corbin Davenport Yep, I'll be adding it to the post shortly. Derik Taylor Also, the ZTE Quartz does have GPS. In the description, you said it doesn't. :| (I have it, which is the only reason I knew that.) marcusmarcus2 The discription also says it has NFC but I cannot see that it does on the T mobile website or the ZTE website. Derik Taylor Huh...didn't notice that. No NFC. :( Not that I planned on using it anyway, but still would have been nice as an option. abqnm I see it's on there now. There's a bit of an error though. In the blurb for it, it says there IS NFC but NO GPS. It's the other way around. It HAS GPS and NO NFC. The entry in the table is correct though. Thanks for this post. It's a great way to compare at a glance. Corbin Davenport Yep, some info got mixed when I was adding the Quartz and Wear24 at the same time. Both the table and the article text should be correct now. abqnm Thanks, but it's not quite correct still. The Quartz description now says but no GPS, LTE, or NFC It does have GPS, but not LTE or NFC. marcusmarcus2 Third time's a charm http://s2.quickmeme.com/img/1a/1ab37c4fc16eae0cf8505ad03c1652fea7659118ab91a6fa386c4e1e514266aa.jpg Corbin Davenport I clearly can't write today. Fixed! abqnm Haha no worries. We've all been there. marcusmarcus2 https://www.zteusa.com/zte-quartz "500 mAh" Dang, it has the largest battery compared to those listed and it still only has "up to 36 hours of battery life per charge" Kyle Gospodnetich Are you guys ever going to talk about the joke that is the Android Wear 2.0 OTAs? Most watches don't even have it yet, and Google completely backed down on their 'fast update, all at once' promise. Dan W agreed. i was hoping that AP would hold Google's feet to the fire on the 2.0 updates. they've been a tragic reminder of how little Google and its partners care about timely updates. Captain On! It's hard to forget, but updates aren't solely on Google. Manufacturers and driver support can hold software updates back regardless of Google trying to shove it out the door. EcE But since there was such promise, shouldn't have Google "certified" the watches somehow? Ensuring that the updates can be pushed timely? kamiller42 Google is doing you a favor. AW 2.0 is a work in progress. Its flow is not as fast and fluid as previous. me me Agreed, I tried the Developer Preview, Watch become unusable. Ambition >> specifications. Carson Saldanha When did they say "fast update, all at once" Mayoo Honorable mention to one of the longest tags section I've seen on AP https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4be9fae6b2e3863638bc20bd2881a3021302f2677608ddc958771313cae23baf.png PJ Anderson The LG Watch Style has a speaker? David Ruddock It doesn't, the table has been corrected. IcerC The Verizon Wear24 comes out in less than a week right? Add that one. tu3218 Has Verizon even announced a date yet? Still nothing on their website. Rashad May 11 tu3218 Where did you see that? Rashad I added the link afterwards. tu3218 Good deal. Although I'm really still waiting for the gear S3. But we all know how that's going for Verizon. Corbin Davenport Yeah, I'll add that one as well. YaKillaCJ The messed up part is the Misfit Vapor is the clear winner in terms of aesthetics and specs when not factoring price. Yet it's priced ridiculously competitive. I think I will get it to upgrade my Moto 360 1st Gen. victor sanchez same here. jawsnnn It will probably have some glaring flaw when it comes out. That has been the pattern for Android Wear devices so far: Announcement,Excitement,Dashed hopes and dreams. 005 anyone know if Misfit vapor has speaker if that has speaker that seals the deal all the way i can leave with out NFC for that price its hands down the best if only had spaker Corbin Davenport I found no mention of a speaker anywhere. 005 thanks hope they do because Huawei Watch 2 Classic went way down in design not sure what the heck happen ObligatoryEscapments It has 5ATM water resistance. In the Android Wear world, that means no speaker. (See: Casio, Nixon, Polar. All speakerless) i_say_uuhhh That Movado looks amazing, just wish it had a speaker and LTE. skillfulshoe Don't be fooled by that picture, it doesn't have an edge to edge screen. Not sure how AP missed that. https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/3/24/15052504/movado-android-wear-watch-connect-baselworld-2017 Roy THE CPU IS CRAP. marcusmarcus2 Really? I thought it was silicon. Roy Really why 28nm?! Stevie_Wonder The Misfit will probably be my first smartwatch. Might have some shortcomings, for example the lacking of NFC, but I don't think I will really need that since Android Pay isn't even launched here. Not sure if a speaker is really useful. And a question for the smartwatch users. My provider doesn't support a second sim so can't use the LTE option, but how useful is it and do you use it a lot? Will it connect through Bluetooth with your phone first and if that fails use LTE to connect? ObligatoryEscapments Casio is even stingier than Fossil with specs, but it's very surprising to hear that they've abandoned their custom SoC from the WSD-10 to use the Qualcomm. Also, I think it's a safe assumption the Verizon/Quanta Wear24 has a speaker. It's an LTE watch that makes phone calls. haberd I would love to see dimensions added. My major problem with this crop is they are too bulky for constant wear bƒÅbƒÅ ghan≈´j Full spec sheet for all Android Wear watches here! https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lbKhNnFBARrT5TVo3bkyp1UzT0S5Iahy3W9dAQf_sfc/edit#gid=0 ethd "The award for the longest smartwatch name goes to the TAG Heuer Connected Modular 45. This watch has an Intel Atom Z34XX processor (the same one the Casio watch uses), 1.39" 400x400 circular display, 410mAh battery, and speaker." I think you meant that it has the same processor the New Balance one uses. Your table and the article both say that the Casio Pro Trek uses a SDW2100. JD Seeing how Google Treats Android Wear. That's a big list of Casualties to add to the already long list of casualties. FlyOnTheWall No Polar M600? Corbin Davenport That was released last year. Akshdeep For ZTE Quartz in the table you have mentioned screen size as 1.4 and 400x400 but below you have written 1.3 and 480x480. Please make correction. Corbin Davenport Thanks, it has been fixed. Carson Saldanha The table says the LG Watch Style has a speaker, but I'm pretty sure it doesn't. Might wanna fix that ;) jmwils3 Haven't gotten any final news from Verizon, as the csms don't have the information, but the NFC chip on the wear24 don't seem to be active and no Android pay present, at least currently. Who knows if an update will activate them by official launch day, but the fact the original verizon article has been edited to remove references to NFC and the product page is gone isn't all that encouraging. Iagoba Apellaniz Compass? I want to see the ability to point to north Richard Markert I have both gens of 360, but I'm going to get a Gear S3 Classic for my next smartwatch. Not going to do another Wear watch. lcasale Can't even buy the LG Sport. It's been sold out on the Google Store and Verizon has pushed back the pre-ordered twice now (by two months). I'm expecting them to miss the latest 5/11 ship date as well. b_boogey_xl I think I'll go with the Huawei Watch 2 Classic. The only knock I have with it is, no LTE (not a deal breaker but‚Ä¶) and I wish they left off those notches that do nothing for a digital watch üôÑ. Don't really care for a digital crown since it doesn't have a greater function like it does on the Apple Watch, it just sounds like a "me too" feature. Now just to wait for the price to drop since everyone hates it‚Ä¶ üòä. peterfares You sure the Wear24 doesn't have GPS? I think it does. OrangeSweater Are you sure the Misfit Vapor has LTE? The only thing I see listed on the product page is Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity. It seems odd that it would include LTE when it is so much cheaper than what is available from other companies.

Coren May 05, 2017 How are your metrics? (Reuters / Alessandro Di Meo/pool) Share Written by Michael J. Coren May 05, 2017 The great contradiction at the heart of the Silicon Valley‚Äôs self-image is that it helps the world while becoming fabulously rich. The record, to say the least, is mixed. Facebook, Google, and Apple undoubtedly benefit millions of peoples‚Äô lives while generating enormous, unprecedented wealth (for some). Yet the human toll‚Äîlost jobs, exploited contractors, massive concentration of wealth at the expense of the lower and middle class, and shuttered newspapers and small companies‚Äîare just as real. This doesn‚Äôt touch on more unsavory practices such as a wage fixing cartel by Apple, Google and others that depressed workers‚Äô incomes, as well as outright deception by companies such as Theranos. Can companies that aim for huge profits while doing good deliver on the latter? A venture capitalist, inspired by Pope Francis‚Äô 2015 encyclical on the environment, is starting an accelerator in Rome to try. Stephen Forte, a serial entrepreneur and founder of Fresco Capital‚Ää, announced on Medium on May 4 that he is starting the Laudato Si‚Äô challenge to ‚Äúinvest in companies that are aiming for huge profits while also caring about doing good in the world.‚Äù These companies will specifically focus on climate change. For the challenge, Forte says founders will start out in a virtual program advised by mentors to hone their business models and accelerate growth. The in-person program runs from July through early September in Rome and culminates in a Demo Day at the Vatican in December (Forte does not say whether the program has an official relationship with the Vatican, and did not respond to inquires at the time of publishing). The program offers an optional $100,000 equity investment for 6%-8% equity stake in the company. Companies are expected to have a prototype and some sales or customer adoption, although not raised a large venture capital round. Climate change is the unifying theme but the ‚Äúmission-driven, for-profit startups‚Äù can work in energy, food, water, conservation, finance and other fields. Forte argues companies who want to put social missions at the center of their business cannot find enough funding. To fix this, the accelerator will back ‚Äúfor-profit mission driven companies that focus on the challenge and values of the Laudato Si,‚Äô‚Äù citing Pope Francis‚Äôs On Care for our Common Home encyclical as the ‚Äúperfect opportunity‚Ä¶to act.‚Äù Pope Francis‚Äô 80-page edict seeks to enshrine environmental stewardship of humans‚Äô common home at the heart of Catholic theology. Caring for the Earth, he argues, is inextricable from caring for each other. ‚ÄúHow wonderful would it be if the growth of scientific and technological innovation would come along with more equality and social inclusion,‚Äù the Pope said in a 2017 TED talk on the topic. ‚ÄúOnly by educating people to a true solidarity will we be able to overcome the ‚Äòculture of waste,‚Äô which doesn‚Äôt concern only food and goods but, first and foremost, the people who are cast aside by our techno-economic systems which, without even realizing it, are now putting products at their core, instead of people.‚Äù Most Popular The psychological importance of wasting time Read full story home our picks popular latest obsessions search

So, if you don‚Äôt know how to show your appreciation, Google Photos can help you sort yourself out. With Google Photos, Google will help you out with a short video featuring your mother and maybe you or your little ones. The app will scan through your photo collection and put together a slideshow of old pictures that bring back old memories. The first thing is to have your pictures, and of course, that of your mother uploaded to Google Photos, then visit this page to create a slideshow. You will also need to identify your mother from the pictures you have uploaded‚Äîand once done, the app will take it up from there. After a while, you will be presented with a video slideshow on the Assistant screen, which can then be saved to your desktop or mobile device. You can even share a link created during the process of creating the video via your favorite social media websites. I personally fancy the idea of sharing the video link as it helps you to tell the entire world how much you love your mother. Mothers occupy a special place in our heart, and what better ways to express a token of love towards them. Maybe not enough to show appreciation for what your mother did, but it‚Äôs a lovely place to start from on the occasion of the 2017 Mother‚Äôs Day. Video Credit: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVadhc9ml28&feature=youtu.be With Google Photos, every update moves it closer to that perfect photo app that everyone truly can‚Äôt get enough of. The last update for example, took the app a level ahead of rival apps with an automatic video stabilizing feature. The automatic video stabilizing feature added last month has the capability of automatically stabilizing videos in your camera roll with just a tap. Updating Google Photos with stabilization feature turns the app into one of the best you can get when it comes to shooting a top quality video. If you have a phone that lacks steadying anything, now you have the right app to stabilize things and help turn your shots to professional works. Google Photos also recently added a functionality that automatically corrects the white balance in any image you open. This will solve a lot of stress and make your picture look like that of a pro. It means you no longer need a third-party tool in the form of an editing tool to correct off tones. Auto white balance has already rolled out to both Android and web; but iOS users may have to wait a little longer. A few other editing tools were also added to the app, including, quick rotate, and ability to easily and quickly edit a photo on the web.

Pearlman, collectSPACE.com Editor | May 5, 2017 01:25pm ET MORE Imagine you could press a button on your smart phone case that would immediately connect you to trailblazing astronauts who would share their experiences of seeing Earth from above. Now, thanks to director Eliza McNitt and Google, you can do just that. The emerging artist and technology company have teamed up to introduce a series of space exploration-inspired "Artworks Live Cases" for Google's Pixel phones, which at a push of a button launches "Dot of Light," a new short documentary by McNitt featuring women who made history in space. "When you get a case, you download an app and the app gives you a different wallpaper," said McNitt, describing the live cases. "There's a button on the back of the phone and when you click that, it will launch the documentary. So, the story is connected about these women who have always dreamt about this journey to the stars." ['Dot of Light' Documentary Tells Story of 3 Female Astronauts (Video)] Google and film director Eliza McNitt have launched "Dot of Light," a new short documentary and exclusive smart phone case series, as inspired by history-making women astronauts. Credit: Google McNitt, whose earlier work has focused on merging virtual reality experiences with scientific discovery and an artistic narrative ‚Äî notably, the Hubble Space Telescope-themed "A Fistful of Stars," which resulted in the largest community VR experience to date ‚Äî has dreamt of that journey, too. She drew inspiration for "Dot of Light" and for the design of the live cases from the stories told by Kathy Sullivan, the first American woman to spacewalk; Nicole Stott, the first woman to paint while in space; and Anousheh Ansari, the first woman to privately-fund her own trip into space. "I was just captivated by their experiences and that simple human connection to our planet from above," McNitt told collectSPACE in an interview. "And what it's like to look out the window of the International Space Station and just how human space travel becomes." Sullivan, who until recently served as the administrator of NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration), logged 22 days on three flights into space, including on the mission to deploy the Hubble Space Telescope. Stott, who is now an accomplished artist herself, spent more than 100 days in Earth orbit as a space station crewmember. Ansari, whose family was the title sponsor for the original X Prize competition, became the first Iranian-American in space on her 11-day mission. In the ten-minute "Dot of Light," Ansari, Stott and Sullivan talk about how their own perspectives of space and Earth changed as a result of their vantage point from high above the planet. It was one of those stories, shared by Ansari at an earlier meeting with McNitt, which served as the theme for the entire project. "One thing that Anousheh said has always stuck in mind," said McNitt. "She was listening to her iPod and staring out the window and saw this thunderstorm below, but it looked like a light show. She thought it was so beautiful ‚Äî but it struck her how there were people below probably stuck in the chaos and yet from above, it looked like this marvelous light show." "If anything, I would say that image inspired the cases and the creation of the film because I was so drawn to that idea of space through the eyes of these astronauts," she said. Film director Eliza McNitt interviews astronaut Kathy Sullivan, the first American woman to walk in space, for McNitt's short documentary, "Dot of Light," commissioned by Google. Credit: Google The case designs, which also drew from the experiences of astronauts Eileen Collins, the first woman to command a space crew, and Mae Jemison, the first African-American woman to fly into space, feature colorful images of planets, nebulas, rocket launches and explorers. "There is a case that we did of a spacewalk and the image is of someone free-floating. Kathy's reaction ‚Äî she saw it and really loved it, but she laughed and said, 'They would have really been mad at me if I had a spacewalk without a tether!'" McNitt recalled, also laughing. Google debuted the documentary, which is free to watch on YouTube, and began sales of the live cases on Friday (May 5), the 56th anniversary of the first American human spaceflight, which is also National Space Day and National Astronaut Day. McNitt's nine case designs cost $40 each and are only available online from the Google Store in the U.S., Canada, Australia, United Kingdom and Germany. "I hope that this series reflects the accomplishments of all of these women astronauts. I think the story of the human exploration of space is a universal one and hopefully, the cases reflect a desire to venture to the stars," said McNitt. "Being able to make cases that represent that journey and then the journey beyond, to one day interstellar travel, was really exciting ‚Äî to be able to reimagine the past that we know and then the future of space exploration," she said.

The Android Skilling programme will be organised in ITS Engineering College from May 8-12 with dozens of teachers attending it. All technical colleges affiliated to Dr Abdul Kalam Technical University (AKTU) can send their faculty for the training. The seminar is being organised by AKTU and Google in order to promote digital education, as per a memorandum of understanding signed between the two. ‚ÄúThis is our faculty training programme that we host when a university is ready to introduce a Android Development Fundamentals course in its curriculum. As a result, we are conducting this training for them,‚Äù said Peter Lubbers, senior programme manager, Google Developer Training. Google had launched a Mobile Skilling programme in 2016 to train and certify two million developers in India over three years. Under this programme, the internet giant will also offer a standalone course via several training partners, including training institutes. ‚ÄúIndia will have four million software developers by 2018, becoming the largest population of developers in the world. But today, less than 25% of these developers are trained to develop and build for the mobile platform. The majority of India‚Äôs internet user base today accesses the internet from their mobile phones and almost all the future internet users in India and many of the world‚Äôs emerging countries will be mobile-use only. There is a huge opportunity for India to become a global leader in mobile app development and we want to contribute and bridge the skills gap that exists today,‚Äù said Lubbers. ‚ÄúKeeping in mind the future of students, the university administration had decided to launch a course on Android-based application development for programmes such as computer science, information technology and masters in computers applications (CS/IT/MCA). To train our faculty, we have decided to hold such workshops in areas across UP where our affiliated colleges are situated,‚Äù said Vinay Kumar Pathak, vice chancellor, AKTU. ‚ÄúAll such colleges in Greater Noida that have computer engineering related programmes such as CS, IT and MCA have been strongly advised to send their teachers to the workshop,‚Äù he added. tags Greater Noida AKTU Android development Google skill development more from noida Noida to crack down on violation of land-use norms May 05, 2017 23:59 IST Submit tower-wise completion schedule and stick to it, Noida CEO tells Credai May 06, 2017 00:02 IST Is Your Couch Making You Cough?

Nearly two years after launching Project Sunroof in the US, Google is expanding its program to Europe‚Äîstarting in the Land der Dichter und Denker. Using high-resolution aerial mapping, Google can help consumers ‚Äúmake accurate decisions about solar power for their homes,‚Äù Project Sunroof product manager Joel Conkling wrote in a blog announcement. Some 7 million buildings are covered, including those in urban areas like Munich, Berlin, Rhine-Main, and Ruhr, where homeowners can calculate their estimated rooftop solar potential by simply entering their address online. The smart technology‚Äîan amalgamation of Google Earth, Google Maps, 3D models, and machine learning‚Äîfactors in roof orientation, nearby tree and building shade, and local weather patterns. It also considers typical electric bill rates for customized results. My parents‚Äô house in Mount Pleasant, S.C., for example, collects 1,615 hours of usable sunlight per year (based on daily weather patterns). Combined with the 1,251 square feet available for solar panels (based on 3D modeling and nearby tree coverage), they could save $15,000 over 20 years. To refine the results, tap ‚Äúfine-tune estimate.‚Äù If you‚Äôre already convinced, click through to see solar providers in your area. German users can purchase a suitable system of photovoltaic modules, energy storage, and system management software directly from Project Sunroof partner E.ON. ‚ÄúWith Sunroof, we are able to digitize sales of solar systems more intensively and thereby increase the appeal of photovoltaics,‚Äù E.ON COO Karsten Wildberger said in a statement. ‚ÄúIt clearly demonstrates the potential benefits of digitalization for the ongoing shift in energy production.‚Äù Initially tested in the San Francisco Bay Area, Fresno, and Boston, the program, which utilizes the same technology in use by Google Earth, has expanded nationwide, and currently covers about 40 percent of German homes. There is no word on a timeline for future growth within the the country or the rest of the globe. ‚ÄúGoogle has been using renewable energy sources within our own infrastructure and beyond for many years,‚Äù Conkling wrote, highlighting the company‚Äôs commitment for 100 percent renewable energy across worldwide operations in 2017. ‚ÄúWith Project Sunroof, we want to help people become even more aware of the solar potential that‚Äôs just above the rafters,‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄúThe future is bright.‚Äù Share Facebook Twitter Linkedin Pinterest Reddit E.ON germany Google Project Sunroof solar solar panel Speak Your Mind More in Tech 05.05.2017 :: 1:30PM EDT :: Daniel Starkey Tech Google Launches New Phone Cases in Honor of Space Day!

Google Pixel long-term review: Still the best smartphone I've ever used David Ruddock Follow View All Posts 2017/05/02 3:28pm PDTMay 2, 2017 75 Plus 1 on G+ 330 Share on Facebook 120 Share on Twitter Total Shares525 News Phone Reviews Pixel Pixel XL Article Contents 1 The hardware 2 Battery life 3 Display, audio, and wireless 4 Camera 5 Performance and software 6 Value 7 Conclusion I have been using the Google Pixel XL for six months now. Not continuously, mind you - I have taken breaks here and there. But after using the Galaxy S8+, the LG G6, and the OnePlus 3T, there is only one phone I've instinctively found myself returning to, and it's this one. Google's Pixel isn't without its flaws; in fact, it has a great many I can cite with ease. The Bluetooth connectivity sucks. The back of the phone has very obvious wear rub. The glass window scratches easily. It's not waterproof. 'OK Google' hotword detection breaks for no apparent reason, necessitating a reboot. The fingerprint scanner is slower than what you'd find on a number of competitor devices. The value proposition is mediocre at best. The screen to body ratio pales in comparison to phones like the G6 or Galaxy S8. And you can't even buy the damn thing. Why do I keep picking up the Pixel time and time again, then? Am I just a brainwashed Google fanboy (don't answer that question)? The answer is consistency. In the nearly seven years I've been doing this, I have never used an Android phone that has held up so well to the tortures of time. The Pixel XL feels nearly as smooth as the day I began using it six months ago. Android glides along with best-in-class touch latency and a responsiveness that feels immediate (if not manic) and satisfying. It's not just performance, either. My battery life remains largely predictable, too, and largely very good. The camera continues to impress with its swift launches and ease of use, and it produces the most consistently excellent results of any smartphone camera I have ever used. HDR+ is easily, for me, the best smartphone camera feature out there. Oh, and even if the fingerprint scanner is a bit slow compared to some, at least the damn thing is easy to reach and reads consistently. Is the XL worth $770 to pick up today? I don't really think so, let alone $870 for the 128GB version we all actually want. And honestly, I have a hard time seeing the point of the smaller 5" model at $650 right now, that just feels like lunacy. The XL offers better battery life and is far from "big phone" status in terms of actual usability - it's really the only one of the two that warrants consideration, in my opinion. With that, let's dive in to the details. The hardware Put the Google Pixel XL next to a Galaxy S8+ and you'll have a pretty hard time finding much to love about Google's phone. 2017 is ushering in a new era of smartphone design language and packaging, and the Pixel XL clearly hails from the period prior to that shift. To be fair, it did come out six months ago. But there's no doubt that from an industrial design point of view, the Pixel is aging fairly rapidly. The 5.5" Pixel XL is nearly as tall as a Galaxy S8+, but the latter has a 6.2" display. Line up the bottom of the S8's screen with the Pixel XL's, and it becomes apparent just how much more panel Samsung has managed to shove into a frame that is only a few millimeters taller. Granted, this does have ergonomic consequences (the S8+ is unabashedly more difficult to use one-handed than the XL because of the screen's height), but I think it's safe to say most of us want more screen where we can get it. I still think the Pixel XL is perfectly nice to hold and like the texture of the aluminum opposed to Samsung and LG's new glass-heavy designs. I also still believe the fingerprint scanner is in the ideal location, unlike the Galaxy S8, which has the most frustrating one in existence. The position of the camera makes accidental smudging less likely, too, and I really like the perfectly flush look Google was able to achieve with the glass window. Visible wear lines on the casing In terms of wear and tear, my XL has... not fared well. The finish on the Quite black model I have here has begun to very noticeably rub off in areas where the aluminum chassis is slightly more raised than others. You could remedy this with a skin, but I personally like this phone totally unadorned. Otherwise, though, it's held up well - the buttons are still fine and I don't notice any real physical problems with the phone aside from the aforementioned finish wear. Just don't drop it in the toilet. Battery life As I said in the introduction, it's consistently good. I always have a pretty clear sense of how much time I've got left when I'm really starting to push my XL to the limits of its longevity. If I'm having a Wi-Fi heavy day with lots of using the phone for browsing the web and texting, 5 hours of screen-on time is doable. If I'm away from home and largely on LTE, I can pretty reliably get 4 hours of screen time assuming it's not stretched over much longer than a 12-hour period. For a full 16-hour day away from wall outlets and going it on mobile data alone, 3 hours is what I generally end up managing. This probably won't impress many of you with Xiaomi, Huawei, or Exynos-powered Samsung devices, and I understand that. But the thing about the Pixel has been just how well I've been able to learn what I can expect in terms of battery performance based on the conditions I'm using it in. I know I can throw in a bit of tethering and Bluetooth streaming without completely obliterating the battery, for example, if I'm at 60% halfway through my day and won't top up till later that evening. My range anxiety with the Pixel is exceptionally low, even if it doesn't offer the very best battery life of any smartphone. Would I like the next-generation Pixels to have larger batteries? Yes, please. Relying only on software to ensure a good power consumption experience is missing half the equation (and I'm not saying that's what Google did). Stuffing even a few-hundred more milliamp hours of capacity in there can be the difference between a dead phone and one that gets you back to the charger at the end of the night. Always fit a bigger battery when you can. Display, audio, and wireless The Super AMOLED Quad HD display still looks bright and crisp, even if the new panel on the S8 is clearly a cut above the part Google is using on the Pixel. Even so, I think the screen is one area where the Pixel XL earns its $770 keep, as there really aren't many phones out there you're going to find which are considerably better in this regard unless they have "Galaxy" inscribed on the back. On the audio front, I found the Pixel's bottom-firing speaker mediocre at the time I reviewed it, and I find it mediocre today. Sadly, it's not getting much in the way of competition, either - both the G6 and S8 have speakers that are at least as unimpressive, if not worse in certain respects, and I hope Google can at least give us that quasi-BoomSound using the earpiece speaker on the Pixel 2 this year. The headphone jack offers performance in line with most Snapdragon 820-series devices and thus isn't the best candidate for pushing your high-impedance cans, but I find it perfectly serviceable in the gym even at high outputs. The quality is there, even if this generation of Qualcomm parts didn't offer as much power as audiophiles probably would have liked. One of my biggest gripes about the XL is its Bluetooth performance. I have used three separate Pixel XLs, and all of them have absolutely terrible Bluetooth signal. Even think about touching the phone in the wrong spot, and the music stream to your headphones or car will cut out. It is absolutely obnoxious. It doesn't matter what kind of headphones, speaker, or car A/V unit - it sucks with anything I've tried. Even walking around with the Pixel XL in my pocket connected to a pair of Bluetooth headphones results in cuts every single time I step up a stair or rest my hand against the pocket the phone is in. The 7.1.2 patch has done nothing to alleviate this issue. It's borderline embarrassing: I have had the Pixel XL corrupt the Bluetooth profiles on my car three times. Each time, the only solution was to factory reset the infotainment unit. I had to factory reset my car. No other phone has ever done this to me, though since the 7.1.2 update this hasn't happened - yet. Wi-Fi performance, on the other hand, has been quite excellent for me, and LTE signal is at least as good as most other phones I tested in 2016. Now that I'm on Verizon, I'm even getting some HD voice calls, which is such a huge upgrade in terms of the call experience. But seriously, Google: get the damn Bluetooth right next time. Camera I can't stop taking pictures with the Pixel. I love this camera. No more words: just photos. ¬† ¬† Performance and software Aside from the aforementioned Bluetooth problems, you know what I find so wonderful about the Pixel? I rarely really get annoyed using it. Apps load up at consistently quick speeds, the OS always feels snappy and responsive, and the touch latency is positively iPhone-y. Like your finger is truly controlling the elements on the screen. The home button and back key respond lightning-quick, in a way that almost starts to make them feel like real buttons. I struggle to really convey how right Google got the basic "interacting with the phone" stuff here. What they managed to do with the Pixel will only make the Pixel 2 that much better a phone, and I will be clear: I do not feel this way about the Galaxy S8. The Pixel feels incredibly natural and pleasant to interact with. There are still hiccups, delays, and little areas where things just don't feel as smooth and seamless as they should on the S8. Google nailed this. No other phone I've used has. Is the Pixel as fast in a straight-line speed sense as a OnePlus 3T? No. But counting fractional differences between the number of seconds it takes to load an app or how long before it's pushed out of memory are not methods that convey an experience. They tell you a couple of very specific things under a controlled circumstance. In practice, I simply find the Pixel the most consistent and smooth Android smartphone I've ever used. But, it does have some usability issues. For one, my 'OK Google' hotword detection breaks basically once a week, necessitating a reboot. I use this when in the car, and so it's very, very inconvenient when this happens. Rebooting the phone takes a good minute-plus, and then it has to reconnect to my Bluetooth (which is never guaranteed to work). This is probably something to do with the Google app, but it's annoying nonetheless. Other than that? I struggle to find anything about the software that I really dislike. Most of my frustrations come down to third-party apps, not the Pixel. And those are annoying on any phone I use. Value When it debuted in October, the Google Pixel XL cost $770. The one you and I actually want, the 128GB model, cost $870. Six months later, the Pixel XL still costs $870. Is it worth it? Hah. No. The successor devices to the current Pixel family will be unveiled in the next five or six months. There is absolutely no good reason to shell out what, with tax, amounts to nearly a thousand dollars for this smartphone. You will absolutely regret it the moment Google announces the Pixel 2 - I guarantee you. Do not buy a Pixel right now. In fact, I'd say just don't buy a Pixel period anymore, we're just too close to the next iteration for that to be remotely sane advice. Conclusion So, that's weird, right? I can't even recommend that you buy what is easily my favorite Android smartphone currently on the market? What kind of long-term endorsement is that? That's because for all its problems and limited availability, the last six months I've used the Pixel have utterly proven to me that Google is capable of building a smartphone that, from a user experience standpoint, rises above the competition. Google's unmatched ability to optimize the way Android and the underlying phone parts interact is very much a reason I love this phone so much. A smartphone should get out of its own way when you use it - it should be an effortless canvas upon which your fingers and eyes naturally engage and interact. That means it should be fast. It should be consistent. And it should just feel right to use. I know that some of these things don't really translate well into concrete assessments, but there's something about the Pixel that really just works for me so well. It's as close to my ideal smartphone as I've ever been. I'm hoping that Google smoothes over some of the rough edges not just with the phone, but with the whole experience of buying and owning it. Why is is to hard to buy a Pixel? It's positively ridiculous just how bad Google has been at keeping this phone in stock. I also think it's hard to ignore that in 2017, the Pixel's design language and overall look and feel are clearly behind the competition. This looks like yesterday's smartphone, and even on the day it was announced it was kind of hard to really fall in love with in an aesthetic sense. At best, it's just kind of boring. Post-purchase experiences should improve, too. Google's online and live chat support are very-just-OK, and what I've heard of the RMA process hasn't been super reassuring - full price credit card holds and iffy-quality refurbished replacements. Of course, that's what happens when you're in the online-only phone sales business. Still, Google should be working to streamline defect, warranty, and accidental damage claims in a way that makes it feel like the nearly-thousand dollars you spent on your phone is going into supporting a thousands-dollar-phone experience. They really also need to stop making crappy cases that are obscenely overpriced. Google made a great phone when it built the Pixel. Now Google needs to be a great phone company. I'm curious to see if they can pull it off. Tags google pixel long term review google pixel review pixel long term review pixel xl long term review subscribe ...

I shouldn't buy the best phone you've ever used. David, you are hurting my brain! David Ruddock you really shouldn't though Jeff Beck Well, Pixel 2, hurry up and get here then. My 6P is losing longevity and running super slow these days. Just can't bring myself to overlook the Samsung FP scanner or I might have settled for an S8. Tr3ple I'm warming you don't do it. I settled for a s7 edge after my 6p, big mistake OhYeah! I made that mistake with the Galaxy S3 and then the Edge 6. Both were disappointing and much worse than my Pixel XL. I love the Pixel! Dean L I got used to my S8+ fingerprint scanner after about a week. I absolutely love the position now, and never touch the camera anymore. Carson Saldanha Throw in free banana splits and you've got a deal! ;) Rickinbsb pick 2 Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà "My 6P is losing longevity and running super slow these days." I see people say all the time that it's Samsung phones that always get slow over time. Intellectually dishonest people, I guess. sweenish They can both be right, you know. Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà Yes, I believe they're both right, depending on various factors. My Note 4 is running better than it did with Lollipop, and a little slower than it did with KitKat. It probably has at least something to do with the Android version and what apps you install on it. My point was that it's intellectually dishonest to pretend it's a Samsung problem, as if it's unique to those phones. And that's how the people frame the problem. sweenish And you were just framing it as "not us, but them." Not better. If I misread your intent, I apologize. Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà You did misread my intent. No problem, though. Treeburgerface It's Android that's the problem. Some Android phones get slower than others. Some Android phones lag more than others. But eventually they ALL get slower and they ALL lag. I've heard 1000 people swear that Android is "silky smooth" and "fixed" now over and over again, before "project butter" and long after and it's still not true. It's certainly improved, which you should expect with the 3 Ghz 12 core processors and 8 GB of RAM they are packing in them now, but at this point I kind of doubt Android is ever going to be quite as flawless in the GUI department as other OS's which were designed to prioritize touch input and treat the users finger like God they way they should and which prioritize reliability over ultimate capability. Just depends which set of sacrifices you are more comfortable with. Ismail Akram Well that totally sum up a perfect phone for me :) Just add Powerful AMP in that Ghisy This, times a million! And also a cheaper, not overpriced XL with at least a 5.7" screen. Then Google can have my money. Meanwhile, I'll be keeping my Nexus 6P. Rod "My 6P is losing longevity and running super slow these days" I don't get this. How is it running super slow all of a sudden? Did you fry half of your board or something? My 3 year old phone performs exactly the same way as when I first unboxed it. Try running in safe mode, because there's probably a rogue app in your end.

Sean Opinion: Even if you can, you probably shouldn't buy a Google Pixel anymore............. David Martrano I'll take my edge over the pixal Any day. I've never had the loss of a Bluetooth connection. Plus there always backordered. I tried to purchase back in December and Google told me I had a 60 day wait. I said OK and moved on. When you lose consumers to me that's not good business! Either have them in stock or lose money! senor_heisenberg It's a Google product, so I'm not even surprised. Just a weird company. ericshmerick Yesterday: don't buy this POS Today: I love this phone lulz Daishi And in both articles he said not to buy the phone. It is advice. He explained himself quite well with several caveats. His point is valid. There is no real reason anyone should buy this 6 month old phone for its introductory price, even if the phone had no flaws. Bob Thank you. Rod You should. However, you'll need to time travel back to the launch day. Tr3ple Incoming triggered Sammy fanboys.... OligarchyAmbulance "WUT?!?! What do you mean your Samsung lags? Mines *never* lagged! It runs as well as the day I bought it, you *obviously* have a defective unit!" username_not_valid I feel the need to factory rest a device several times a year anyway, Samsung or not. David Martrano Totally agree, my edge has never lagged. Purchased over a yr ago. Just as fast as the day I bought it. Plus with the Nouget update even better! deadpenguins My fiance's gs7 is less than a year old, yet it *constantly* lags and hangs up. She has to restart it at least once every few days and has to charge it twice a day even though she barely uses it! See how useful anecdotes are? OligarchyAmbulance Woosh Jermell Howard Jr Lol funny and true but lets be hone st Google in the Smartphone world is like France and Samsung is like the U.S. Jeff Beck I'm not sure who that comparison favors. Jermell Howard Jr The U.S is a world superpower and France is not. Samsung is much bigger in terms phone market share Winston But Samsung doesn't have a loud CEO who tweets in all caps during his morning bowel movement. Jermell Howard Jr üòÇ ok? King_Android üòÇüòÇüòÇ xyz Yeah, they just have a better education and healthcare system, and higher quality of life statistics. But America does have a lot of big, shiny bombs. I'll give you that. Marty Nah, still not biting. Me no like HTC. "I have a hard time seeing the point of the smaller 5" model at $650 right now, that just feels like lunacy." I'm one who prefers a smaller phone. Had Apple included an FHD display on the 4.7" iPhone 7, I'd be sporting one with a Cheshire Cat grin. RyRyTheFunBun I think that Apple did the right thing by sticking with just an HD display on the 4.7. Good density with less of hit on battery. But if they wanted to make the phone thicker.. rockon999 I just bought one. Honestly David, 6 months is a long time to wait to buy a new device (Pixel 2). My Moto X is done for and I wanted a good phone. What can I say. At least I don't use Bluetooth and don't mind cases... Paladin27 I just bought one... 4 weeks ago and got it yesterday. Great timing on these two articles, AP. :-/ BUT, My Nexus 6 is dying and I needed something new. I weighed the options, my wife even has a G6, but I'm glad I got the Pixel XL, and besides, it will be 8 months before anyone actually has a Pixel 2 in their hands. whispy_snippet I wouldn't worry at all. Both of you. You got what in my book is still the best phone you can get. Not the best in every single way, but the best in the ways that are arguably the most important. JDC Great article @rdr0b11:disqus. Fair and balanced. I feel the same way about my Pixel. I also have the fun time of explaining to friends and family why my Pixel is the best Android phone I've used BUT they shouldn't buy one. I personally can't wait to see what improvements are made to the Pixel 2. mwolverine I have an OP3T, and one thing i don't get is how is the user experience on the pixel superior? Both are running nearly stock Android and are very consistent. Tr3ple You'd be surprised how much better the Bexel XL actually is compared to the 3t. Granted the 3t is the best bang for the buck out there. Duder12 It's more fluid and smooth. What don't you understand? Ismail Akram Have you used Pixel for yourself for month or for a week? I had OP3(not T) and came to Pixel XL. One thing very obvious to me when switching was smoothness between the two. Pixel animations feels more natural. and scrolling feels so smoother, its not massive difference and normal users can't even tell the difference, until he have used so many phones. then Software update thing is really awesome on Pixel. Camera is best for me on Pixel. Display is also great. In term of looks I prefer OP3 more. well IMO if Pixel have better design it would be even better for me. BTW I hear people have a lot of issues with OP3T touch latency which OnePlus improved but not gone. people don't even notice these latency things until they use phone with less touch latency. Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà Given that you admitted many (but not all) of it's faults, if that's the best phone you've ever used, you've set the bar incredibly low. crackcaffeine You sound like you know a lot about this topic. What is the best phone you've ever owned? Inb4 Note 7 Grahaman27 "It's the best smartphone ever but don't buy it!" Which half of this is bullshit? Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Neither, if you read and understand the context. Grahaman27 A new phone probably launching in 6 months (that we know nothing about) is not a valid reason to not recommend buying a phone. Tr3ple It's an opinion you know? Jarrett Lennon Kaufman If that were the only reason he stated in the article, I might agree with you. Again, read and understand the context. MJ Did you consider reading the article and trying to understand the words? Suicide_Note I'm just grateful i haven't experienced any issues with the Bluetooth on my XL. Keith Stefanec Me neither. Sean Me either CF542 You guys are lucky. I'm on my second Pixel and still have Bluetooth issues. Not as bad as the first unit but still a problem. Love the phones‚Äã though Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà I frequently see comments by people who say they're on their 3rd or 4th Pixel. It makes me wonder how many of those 2.1 million Pixels HTC shipped are replacement phones. David Martrano When the day comes when they sell 50 million pixals, please let me know. It's a great phone for a limited audience! Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà "Limited audience" -- I couldn't have described its fans better than that. Tom Takumi Okamoto Google should buy OnePlus to improve them as a phone maker. NexusKoolaid How did that work out for Motorola? Tom Takumi Okamoto Not well. I don't think Google wanted to be a phone maker at that time because the Nexus program was still on. If I'm not mistakin it acquired Motorola just to protect Android from lawsuits. Knowledgeborn Allah The entire basis of your argument kind of falls apart when you admit that you can't recommend for anybody to buy it, and I think that's because of the Pixel's main problem: it's overpriced, underpowered, and unsustainable on Android's current platform. The fact that it'll be DOA by 2019 just makes it worse. Could I recommend that people buy the Pixel XL right now (if they could get their hands on one anyway)? Nope. Could I recommend that OnePlus 3T? Yes, definitely! The S7 Edge, which is OLDER than the Pixel? Yes! There was even an article I read today with reviewers STILL recommending people to buy the iPhone 6s Plus to save money, and that device came out 2 years ago! When compared to those devices, the Pixel just doesn't hold up, which is why I don't think anybody would recommend it today, only 6 months after its release. Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà They expected to sell 3 million by the end of 2016 and 7 million more in 2017. HTC has shipped about 2 million since it was released over 6 months ago. 'nuff said. whispy_snippet Can you provide references for these assertions? OligarchyAmbulance The reference would likely be his anus. Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà Google "htc shipped 2.1 million pixels". For comparison purposes, Sony shipped a total of 5.1 million Xperia phones in Q4 2016. And that was a drop of 33% year over year. whispy_snippet That's not a reference. That's some words inside double inverted commas. Tr3ple https://www.google.com/amp/m.gsmarena.com/google_has_already_sold_21_million_pixels_report_says-amp-24270.php whispy_snippet Thanks for this. But it only states the amount of Pixels sold, being 2.1 million. I haven't seen a reference where Google officially states "they expected to sell 3 million by the end of 2016 and 7 million more in 2017." A statement like this sounds like horse shit to me. There's no way Google would be foolish enough to make a specific target like this available to the public. In other words, Felonious Monk is almost certainly bull shitting. Again. Tr3ple He wasn't bullshitng lol http://www.digitimes.com/news/a20161006VL200.html whispy_snippet "Sorry, the page you are trying to open is available only for our paid subscribers." Tr3ple pocketnow.com/2016/10/06/google-pixel-smartphones-4-million-sales-forecast whispy_snippet Are you even reading the articles you're referencing? Once again, nowhere does it say Google "expected to sell 3 million by the end of 2016 and 7 million more in 2017." He's bull shitting because that's what a bull shitter does. Tr3ple Google never said that, that's your boy up there paraphrasing. Either way they predicted the phone to sell quite a lot. And it is. whispy_snippet He's not paraphrasing. He's manipulating information, being deliberately misleading, and bull shitting. Completely. Tr3ple "Digitimes Research's Taiwan Mobile Device Tracker - HTC's handset shipments are expected to reach 6.5-7 million units in the second half of the year, up less than 10% from 5.8-6.1 million units in the first half." whispy_snippet So is the digitimes research device tracker establishing projected figures based off their own analysis or from direct statements from Google and/or HTC? OligarchyAmbulance So you know how many phones Google expected to ship because you made it up and it's now a fact? lol Alright, buddy. Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà Android Authority: "Report: Pixel shipments could hit 4 million this year" (2016) "Morgan Stanley: Google on track to sell 3 million Pixel devices in 2016, 5-6 million next year" Google it for yourself. Randy Gindy Googled. Found several sites that reported Pixel sales already being 2.5 million. Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà Cool. No sources, but I'll trust you. Maybe by the end of 2017 they'll hit the projected sales target for the end of 2016. Randy Gindy Where were your sources? Randy Gindy Xperia is a pretty well known brand already in several markets. The Pixel brand hasn't had much exposure aside from the couple models of developer oriented Chromebooks and Tablet. I wouldn't assert that because an established brand sells better than a brand that just really started that it makes it a bad phone. Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà Xperia is a great example of a failing phone in the US, at least, which is why I used it as a comparison. "You may as well pretend Sony doesn‚Äôt exist in the U.S" https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/why-sonys-xperia-phones-keep-failing-in-the-us/ Randy Gindy It maybe a failing brand but it is established. Tr3ple Just shut it, ill recommend a pixel over all these phones you mentioned, s7 egde won't get anroid P, I can guarantee you that. Until you've owned and used a pixel XL you shouldn't comment on it. tim242 It is HTC trash. Tr3ple Yeah we get it, you don't own one. tim242 Why would I? Hardware issues galore. Not to mention, the stock problem. Tr3ple Lol as i thought, move along. tim242 Deflect much? It is well documented trash. Tr3ple Hahahahahaha, like I said move along tim242 You can't deny it, so you deflect. You must be a trump worshiper. Jeff Beck Well, that escalated quickly. Richard Dennis Yea... yea.. we know you're here you're queer get used to it.. Next! Safe circles, safety pins, and pink hats for everyone.. (Paid for by the government of course) tim242 Damn str8! Knowledgeborn Allah Fanboyism at its finest... The Pixel is not a good buy compared to any of those phones, and I DO have the Pixel XL. I know from experience that it's overpriced, underpowered, and unsustainable with Android's current system. ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è The S7 Edge probably won't get Android P... And? Based on the chart just released (scroll up), most other Android devices probably won't get Android P either, at least not until "Android R" is out. Lol! Tr3ple Judging by what you said I doubt you have a Pixel XL. Yes it's overpriced, just a lil. If somebody don't care about the price, yes pixel is definitely a better buy Knowledgeborn Allah What kind of sense does that make? It's a "better buy" if you don't care about the price? üò≥ Like I said, it's overpriced for what it is. Tr3ple yes plenty of us don't care about the price, it makes plenty of sense. Pfft Knowledgeborn Allah The idea of being a "better buy" contextually includes the price. The fact that the Pixel is overpriced for what it is automatically means it's not a good buy. And again, that's coming from somebody who bought the XL variant at launch. Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà The OP3T and Axon 7 are much better buys. Knowledgeborn Allah Absolutely! Tr3ple No, the idea of "better buy" is a combination of EVERYTHING. Software, camera, build quality, reliability etc.. and let me tell you that the pixel is in fact t the better buy, only phone on that list I think MAYBE might be a better buy is the 3T, but the camera and battery life are ok not great, but for the money yes. Knowledgeborn Allah Yes, everything, INCLUDING the price. Again, the fact that it's overpriced means, contextually, that it's not a good buy. This shouldn't be that hard to understand. whispy_snippet I don't think it's over priced at all. Knowledgeborn Allah You don't think it's overpriced, being identical in price to the iPhone? I've heard other people make that claim, and yet they believe that the iPhone is overpriced... What's your view regarding this? Do you think the iPhone is overpriced? What does something being overpriced mean to you? whispy_snippet I guess I should rephrase. It's not over priced when compared to what it's competing with. "Over priced" is a bit of a relative term. It doesn't hold a lot of meaning. What is over priced to one person might be a steal for another. I think you can make the argument that compared to other phones the Pixel, iPhone and Galaxy S8 are all expensive. But over priced? That's a murkier discussion. Knowledgeborn Allah I agree, but I think status plays a role in pricing when it comes to other manufacturers. Samsung and Apple both have established brands, and people are willing to pay top dollar for their devices because they've already proven themselves. Google isn't in this same position in the smartphone hardware department. Also, I'd say that both lines - e.g. Galaxy S series and iPhone - offer much more in the way of unique features and premium hardware than what Google offers with the Pixel. But that's just my personal perspective... whispy_snippet See that's where I'm not so sure. The Pixel still has the best camera of any smartphone and an amazing display to back it up. Straight away it's hit two areas out of the park that matter to most people. At launch it had a class leading SoC that continues to offer great performance. It has plenty of RAM. Rock solid build quality. A super fast and accurate fingerprint sensor. USB-C (remember the GS7 didn't which was Samsung's 2017 flagship) with fast-charging and excellent battery life. It has the most capable voice assistant. It's got the latest version of Android and what I believe to be the best overall user experience for most people - it's consistently fast and smooth, unlike anything from Samsung, and will receive timely updates for much longer than the competition. The Pixel is the iPhone of the Android world and I think it has a market to fill. Do I think the Pixel 2 needs to be better? You bet. No one is denying this. What phone doesn't need to be better than its predecessor? If the Pixel 2 doesn't at least have waterproofing and a higher display-to-bezel ratio critics will hold them to account. But I'm pretty sure these features are a guarantee. The thing is, and I've said this elsewhere, I don't really consider a lot of the hardware bells and whistles we see from the likes of Samsung all that meaningful. The curved display is a gimmick. It looks great, but I'm not at all sold from a functional perspective. The same with the new 18:9 ratio. For a mobile device I consider one handed usability important. Reaching the notification pull-down with one hand is already a no-go on the GS8 and its fingerprint sensor is another ergonomic mis-step. And a heart rate sensor? Who on earth uses this? Same goes with its iris-scanner and face recognition. Why use these options when a well positioned fingerprint sensor is more convenient? It's all just guff. Bullet points for carrier salespeople to sing about in store. I think waterproofing is a biggie though. Google can't drop the ball here. I also think wireless charging is going to become significant if Apple introduces it to their new iPhone. We've seen Google offer wireless charging in the past and then take it away because, well, I don't think that many people really cared. But I sense the tide is going to turn on this. Google's phone is priced the same as the iPhone and Galaxy S because it's being positioned as a premium product. I hate the word "premium". It's huge BS when you really think about it. But ultimately this is the strategy Google is taking with its new phone. A high margin, high performing, premium flagship for the masses. I think the best of the Pixel line is yet to come. Knowledgeborn Allah I also think the Pixel launched with a lot of good qualities and features, and that's why I rushed to purchase it. However, around the same time, I bought an iPhone 7+, just to give iOS a fair shot. Now that I've used both devices, I think it's a huge mistake to call the Pixel "the iPhone of the Android world". In reality, it doesn't even come close, and that's where the problem comes in. The iPhone is Apple's primary device when it comes to sales, but it can almost be seen as an accessory to other Apple devices, like the Mac and the iPad, etc. The Apple ecosystem allows all their devices to work together seamlessly through Continuity, and this is something Android can't replicate (at least not at this point in time). The Pixel may look similar to an iPhone, but it definitely doesn't function like one. And yes, I know that Samsung (and carriers) puts a bunch of bloat on their devices, showing off features that many people will never use. The difference, though, is all about opportunity and selection. Samsung built an entire brand around giving their consumers more than they'll ever ask for, and that's what keeps those customers coming back. I don't know anybody who uses that heart-rate sensor on the back. When I see it, I think, "Why wouldn't they remove that and use the idea of the heart-rate monitor to sell more Galaxy Gear smartwatches?" I just didn't get it... But, hypothetically, if somebody ever ends up in a situation where they need a heart-rate monitor, Samsung has them covered. I learned that firsthand when my nephew was taken to his school nurse due to an asthma attack, and the nurse didn't have a heart-rate monitor in her office. Her assistant pulled out his Galaxy S7 Edge and used the heart-rate monitor on there to relay it to medical services when they arrived. I know, that would be a generally rare occurrence, but it happens from time to time, enough for people to consider what would happen if they didn't have it. Personally, I don't think Google has enough "skin in the game" at this point to really charge that much for the Pixel. Apple and Samsung have proven brands in the smartphone space. Tech reviewers giving it high marks isn't going to matter too much among average consumers, because most people just aren't interested in technology to that extent. They just want something that works, and works reliably. Google hasn't demonstrated the ability to make hardware that just works reliably (unless you count the Chromebook Pixel line, which most people didn't buy either). It's always better to start at the bottom and work your way up, than to start at the top and get knocked all the way down. Sean Everyone on here KNOWS you dont have a Pixel or a Pixel XL......but troll on......... Knowledgeborn Allah "Everyone on here" knows what I have? Seriously? You're an idiot. üí© Knowledgeborn Allah I find it quite funny that anybody who criticizes the Pixel is automatically labeled a troll, a hater, a sheep, etc. How ridiculous! ¬Ø_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà After Marshmallow, I stopped caring about new Android versions. I'm almost afraid to get a Nougat phone, given there have been so many problems with it. As for O and P, I'll let you Pixel users alpha test it and then decide if I care about getting it. Knowledgeborn Allah üòÇüòÇüòÇ I actually bought the Pixel XL mostly because I've had every Nexus device since the Nexus 4. I thought it would be a great device, but I was disappointed. It's not horrible, but it's definitely not worth the price. And, to be honest, I haven't really used it consistently in months. I use it occasionally to access the Google Play Store, but that's about it. My primary device nowadays is an iPhone 7+, and it's miles ahead of the Pixel XL in almost every way. Alex Louderback "DOA by 2019" is a contradiction, my friend. Knowledgeborn Allah If we're talking about release timeframe, you're right. But there's a big difference between when a device is released and when it's in the hands of the consumer. Last time I checked, the Pixel XL variants are still out of stock, even though nobody's buying them. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman DOA means "dead on arrival," which was Alex's point. It can't be DOA by years from now. Knowledgeborn Allah That's cool and all, but that's not a counter argument... OK, maybe "DOA" wasn't the best terminology, but the points still stand. The device, today, 6 months after its release, is still too flawed to recommend. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Stop comparing it to an iPhone. No other Android phone should be purchased six months after its release either. Only iPhones have that status because they have no competition within themselves. Within Android, after six months, there's another king of the hill. But I wouldn't recommend a Galaxy six months after its release, or ANY other model of Android phone. Knowledgeborn Allah "Stop comparing it to an iPhone"? üò≥ Google released the Pixel devices to directly compete with the iPhone! If they can't do that, then why are they matching it in price? If the product is devalued already, then Google needs to drop the price. Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà Put a fake button on the huge chin and it would look exactly like an iPhone. That's no accident. Sean You and Knowledgeborn Allah should have a troll off competition.......... Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Because your point has NOTHING to do with the Pixel, and EVERYTHING to do with Android as a whole. The reason the Pixel's not a good value proposition at this point is because it's competing against all other Android phones, which together are competing against the ONLY iPhone. You can't compare them in this regard. Period. Also, there's no point in comparing them because if I wanted an iPhone I'd own an iPhone. I don't. In which case I'm determining the best Android option. Right now, someone who isn't buying an iPhone, shouldn't buy a Pixel. That has nothing to do with the iPhone and everything to do with the competition in its own space. Knowledgeborn Allah That's not true. Every Android device isn't designed to directly compete with the iPhone, but that's exactly what Google tried to do with the Pixel. So, yes, they can definitely be compared. Just because the Pixel doesn't stack up doesn't mean that it shouldn't be compared. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Android, as a whole, is designed to compete with the iPhone. While the Pixel has to compete with both the iPhone AND all of Android. "Just because the Pixel doesn't stack up doesn't mean that it shouldn't be compared." You're not reading or comprehending my words if THAT was your takeaway from what I said. Not bothering anymore. Knowledgeborn Allah Android as a whole? Android is an operating system. Its rival is iOS. You're positioning the platform as if it's completely one-sided. The iPhone has to compete with various Android devices too. It just happens to have an ecosystem of hardware to aid it along the way. You're acting like an Android OEM can't do the same thing if they put in time and resources. Based on the fact that Android manufacturers are only pushing out hardware components for smartphones (and occasionally tablets and smartwatches), I'd say their biggest competitors are other Android OEMs, not Apple and iOS. For the record, the LG G6 wasn't designed to compete with the iPhone. It's competing with the Galaxy S8. The HTC 10 was competing with the G5 and S7. It's never been an Android vs "Apple ecosystem" thing on the manufacturing level. The only OEMs who actively try to compete with the iPhone are Samsung (S and Note lines) and Google (Pixel line), and it looks like Huawei is just starting to build up their consumer base in the West to do that too. The others are generally competing against other Android OEMs. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Your first paragraph made my entire point for me: Android manufacturers', including Google, biggest competitors are one another, *not* Apple and iOS. But ANDROID's biggest competitor is iOS, which has only ONE device line: the iPhone. The Google Pixel, while it may have been designed as Google's attempt to battle the iPhone, doesn't exist in a vacuum. It's still ALSO doing everything from the first paragraph: competing against all other Android manufacturers. No matter how much Google may *want* to break out of that, their wants are irrelevant to reality. And the reality is that the Pixel is one of many Android phones, all of whom are competing against one another, the sea of which is competing against the iPhone. So how well the Pixel stacks up against the iPhone isn't relevant, as it's not the focus of this article or the reasons for David's position. WITHIN the Android ecosystem, it's simultaneously the best Android phone he's ever used (same here) and not a good idea to buy it right now BECAUSE OF THE REST OF ANDROID and NOT for any reason having anything to do with the iPhone. For anyone who wants to buy an iPhone, which is a massive number of people, there is absolutely no competition, allowing them to charge anything they want. For anyone who wants Android, there's an endless sea of competition, making the Pixel's price and specs within the refresh cycle a much harder sell right now. Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà The headline is, "Google Pixel long-term review: Still the best smartphone I've ever used" not the best Android phone. I assume he meant Android phone, though. Still all smartphones compete with one another. And if the Note 8 is disappointing, I'll definitely consider getting an iPhone 8. Because the best smartphone (for what I want and need) is what matters to me, not the best Android phone or even the best (insert OEM here) phone. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Cool. We have different priorities, which is fine. I couldn't use an iPhone. Apple products and their ecosystem don't fit my needs. So I'm looking at *only* Android phones. So it's entirely a matter, at any one time, of what the best *Android* phone is. Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà I thought I couldn't use an iPhone, too. But I've used an iPhone 6S Plus now, and it's really quite a good phone. Even the display is better than I thought it would be. And that's quite a compliment coming from someone (me) who will never use anything but AMOLED. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman I have to use them for my clients sometimes. They're fine. They work well. I'm still too embedded in Google's ecosystem in ways that don't make switching feasible. Knowledgeborn Allah I get your point... I still think there are certain ways around that, especially considering Google's vast amount of resources. But yes, I see how that could definitely be a problem. They could still salvage the Pixel line, though, by providing standout features like Samsung does, or by undercutting their competition with their pricing like OnePlus does. I think either of those could work fairly well. The notion of putting standout features in their devices could be a challenge, since their devices pretty much serve as a template for Android as a whole. Undercutting the competition would be easier, and that's what Google actually did for years with the Nexus program. I think that's the big "bust" factor for them. If the Pixel could be purchased for $450-500, it would still be a good purchase even now, just like the OnePlus 3T. But it's really hard to justify paying $800 for the Pixel while the Galaxy S8 and G6 are on the scene. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman They already went for standout features. They made a big push to be more "opinionated" with several software and UI customizations, along with their big hardware push. The difference is a huge number of the Galaxy standout features just aren't that compelling. That's the sort of stuff they skipped. Knowledgeborn Allah When I mentioned standout features, I was talking about exclusive ones. The Pixel doesn't really have any. They marketed the phone as having the "best camera on a smartphone", and that's turned out to be a debatable subject among people depending on their perspectives - whether they like realistic colors or oversaturated photos. The Google Assistant is now available on pretty much every Android phone, just like the fingerprint scanner gestures. The hardware from the front looks strikingly similar to the iPhone -which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it leads people to question why they should get an iPhone lookalike, when they can get the real iPhone for the same price. The display is decent, but it's not even as good as the one on the Galaxy S7. Google ditched stereo speakers for a mediocre mono speaker. Pixel Imprint is noticeably slower than the fingerprint sensors on many cheaper offerings. The Pixel launcher was all the rage, until pretty much every third-party launcher started adding many of its features into their custom launchers. To make matters worse, the device is almost always completely out of stock online and unavailable to purchase through carriers. And those are just basic factors. Add to it the fact that Google just published an EOL report for the Pixel, solidifying the point that it'll stop getting Android OS updates in less than 2 years from now, and people are going to say, "F**k that!" That's why, personally, I think they should drop the price and salvage what's left, unless they really don't care about selling them. whispy_snippet Price and value are not intrinsically linked with "premium" products. You don't just drop the price on a product you're trying to position as high end because it's gotten a little older. You're only going to tarnish its reputation. A major reason why many people buy high end premium products is BECAUSE they're expensive. Marketing 101 mate. Phones are modern day status symbols. I remember when the Pixel launched some people scoffed at the price and said "well I'm just gonna wait for Google to discount it in a few months". I tried to tell these people that it wasn't going to happen and that the best "bang for buck" time to buy the Pixel was actually launch day. And here we are, months later, and the Pixel is still being positioned as a high end premium product. And believe me, it'll still be priced at the high end right up until the Pixel 2 launches. Apple have long been the masters of pricing their products at the high end of the market despite cheaper alternative offering features that savvy buyers demand. But look how well Apple has done. Billions of dollars in the bank thanks to sales in a product often considered a step behind the cutting edge. If you want a cheaper phone with certain features important to you, get one. There are countless options. But give up on the idea of a cheap, affordable Pixel. It's NEVER going to happen. Knowledgeborn Allah I'm not disputing that. You're correct in saying that many people buy high end products because high prices give the illusion of inherent quality. The problem, however, is that the Pixel is competing against the iPhone, and it hasn't worked. In fact, it can't and won't work. There aren't any Android OEMs who can realistically compete with Apple. They may design devices that compete with the iPhone, but they can't compete with Apple. Why? For starters, continuity. When you buy a Pixel device, you're buying a product. When you buy an iPhone, you're buying into the Apple brand and ecosystem, where all their devices, ranging from the Apple Watch to the Mac to the iPad, iPod Touch and Apple TV, and even AirPods and Beats wireless headphones, all work seamlessly together. Secondly, you're buying into the Apple Store and it's customer service benefits. Thirdly, you're buying into Apple's update cycles, which come directly from Apple to all their devices instantaneously and average around 4-5 years of support. The list goes on and on. Google isn't naive. They have their own ecosystem, but it's centered around their software and services, which you can get on practically any device. They don't have a hardware ecosystem. They knew what they were getting into, and they took a chance by trying to compete directly with the iPhone in pricing. They also see that it's clearly not working, so it's time for them to adopt a new strategy. If they actually want large groups of people buying their devices, which I'm not entirely sure they do, they either need to have standout features like Samsung Galaxy devices (which they don't), or they need to lower their prices. Right now, lowering the price on the Pixel is the only way they can salvage it. whispy_snippet I disagree on many levels. You don't establish yourself as a hardware company overnight, and you don't establish a product's premium reputation overnight. Yes, Google doesn't have the same hardware ecosystem Apple has at this stage. But they've now got skin in the game that matters most - phones. All of the products you listed from Apple don't come close to the significance of the phone. Many will never own an Apple TV, a MacBook, or Airpods. But almost everyone owns a phone - and we don't know where hardware is going to take us next. Maybe in a few years time tablets will be dead, everyone will be using hybrids and home assistants will be one of the most important gadgets in our lives. Who knows? The point is just because Google doesn't have the same suite of products as Apple doesn't mean they won't one day, or that they won't be the company that leads the pack in the hardware that matters tomorrow. Further to this, just because the Pixel lives in an ecosystem different to the iPhone doesn't mean it can't be a success in its own right. Google is known for its class leading services. What happens if it starts gradually making these hugely important and much loved services - like Google Maps, Google Drive, YouTube, Google Photos... even Google Search - Pixel exclusives? It sounds improbable - almost impossible! But it serves as a reminder of how powerful and influential Google is in the services EVERYONE uses, Apple customers included. Google entered the hottest fight in consumer tech and delivered a hugely impressive smartphone on its first attempt. It wasn't perfect, but it bettered the competition in a number of important ways. Who knows what Google has in store for the Pixel 2, 3 or 4? They're in this for the long haul. You can't expect the Pixel to sell like the iPhone and Galaxy S in its first, second or perhaps even third iteration. But as time goes by, the Pixel will stand shoulder to shoulder with Apple and Samsung's best in the minds of the average consumer. There's too much at stake for Google to sit this one out. Knowledgeborn Allah I think you're missing my point... I'm not saying Pixel can't be a success. It definitely can be, but Google needs a better strategy to make that happen. When you're competing against a company that has a structured, proven hardware ecosystem that seemingly locks users in, you have to do something extraordinary to break them out. Samsung is doing that by releasing groundbreaking smartphones. OnePlus is doing that by undercutting flagship devices via pricing. What's Google doing? The idea that Google has leverage because of their services is naive at best. Google isn't going to make their services exclusive to the Pixel or its brand because they make too much money from their portals. If they restricted YouTube to the Pixel, everybody would switch to Vimeo or something else, and Google's stock would plummet. The same goes for pretty much all their other services too. The only leverage they have is in financing, and that's very comparable to Apple anyway. In fact, I think Apple may actually be worth MORE than Google at the moment. In reality, Google will never try to conquer the hardware space. Services are their moneymaker, and the more devices they can attach their web services to, the better it is for their bottom line. That's what it's really about, at the end of the day: money. The Nexus program was more popular than the Pixel, even though there was far less advertising for it, because Google implemented a strategy of undercutting their competition. They probably thought that meant people just loved their devices and decided to launch a "premium" product. In reality, one of the main selling points of the Nexus line was its affordability. The Pixel doesn't have that, and that's why it's not selling. Again, they need to undercut their competition in pricing, or they need to implement standout features that are exclusive to the Pixel. I see those as the only sure ways to salvage the disaster that is the Pixel line right now. whispy_snippet Maybe grab yourself a cup of tea... ‚ÄúI think you're missing my point... I'm not saying Pixel can't be a success. It definitely can be, but Google needs a better strategy to make that happen. When you're competing against a company that has a structured, proven hardware ecosystem that seemingly locks users in, you have to do something extraordinary to break them out. Samsung is doing that by releasing groundbreaking smartphones. OnePlus is doing that by undercutting flagship devices via pricing. What's Google doing?‚Äù But is Samsung making ground breaking smart phones? Is Apple? No one is doing anything especially impressive at the moment. A larger display is a nice to have, and I've no doubt everyone is going to follow this trend, but it's not what I'd call ‚Äúground breaking‚Äù. The same applies to hardware features like wireless charging, stereo speakers, or dual cameras. All nice to have, but merely extensions of core concepts of how we use our phones. So what? I think Google has a unique edge through its ability to leverage its vast swathes of data and machine learning to create personalised services that no one else can. They‚Äôve been leading the game in key areas of software and services for many years now. That‚Äôs not to say Google is perfect of course, but take mobile photography for example. With the Pixel, Google was able to enter the phone market and best the competition first go through software expertise. And look at Assistant. It‚Äôs way ahead of Siri despite Apple getting the major head start. Google Chrome is the leading web browser. Google Maps is the leading mapping service. Google Search is so dominant in our lives that it spawned the phrase ‚Äújust Google it‚Äù. Smartphone hardware has just about reached conceptual maturity but software and services are absolutely ripe for further innovation. And if I had to bet on which company has the greatest potential to revolutionise this space I‚Äôd bet on Google. Not Apple, and definitely not Samsung. ‚ÄúThe idea that Google has leverage because of their services is naive at best. Google isn't going to make their services exclusive to the Pixel or its brand because they make too much money from their portals.

The only leverage they have is in financing, and that's very comparable to Apple anyway. In fact, I think Apple may actually be worth MORE than Google at the moment.‚Äù Of course Google isn‚Äôt going to flick a switch overnight that takes all its services away from non-Pixel users. I‚Äôm not suggesting this would be any sort of sensible strategy. But it‚Äôs not hard to see Google making certain features of these services Pixel exclusives as a first step. Let‚Äôs picture ourselves a couple of years from now. Hypothetically speaking, what if Google started giving Pixel users access to ‚ÄúYouTube Sports‚Äù for free? Or what if they gave Pixel users 2TB of Google Drive storage for free? Or what about unlimited uploads to Google Photos for free? ...wait, they already do this. What about exclusive access to the Google Assistant? Wait, they did this too in the launch stage of the Pixel! Can you see what I‚Äôm getting at? In the coming years, as the Pixel gains further traction in the minds of the general public, Google will be better placed to leverage its strengths and make the Pixel a value proposition no one else can offer. Imagine all of the above I‚Äôve listed, and more, only available on the Pixel? Google has a huge advantage on the cloud service side of the equation - an advantage that I think is going to prove increasingly valuable in the coming years. ‚ÄúIn reality, Google will never try to conquer the hardware space. Services are their moneymaker, and the more devices they can attach their web services to, the better it is for their bottom line. That's what it's really about, at the end of the day: money.

I see those as the only sure ways to salvage the disaster that is the Pixel line right now.‚Äù Google is trying to conquer the hardware space right now. Chromecast, Chromecast Audio, Google WiFi, Google Home, the Pixel, Daydream, Chromebooks, the hiring of Rick Osterloh as SVP of hardware - there‚Äôs evidence of Google‚Äôs push into hardware everywhere. But you don‚Äôt usurp hardware empires like Apple or Samsung with the click of the fingers. This is a long game, one that is going to rage for years to come. If Google continues to develop the Pixel at the same rate it‚Äôs developing its services (and by all indications this is Google‚Äôs intention) its phone will be a formidable force sooner than you think. The unrefined, ‚Äúrushed‚Äù gen-one Pixel won critical acclaim from tech sites and bloggers everywhere - for example Android Police, The Verge, and MKBHD all rated the Pixel one of the best smartphones one could buy when it launched. Labelling the Pixel line a ‚Äúdisaster‚Äù is as laughable as it is bizarre. Clearly it‚Äôs selling well as Google is having huge trouble keeping it in stock. And yeah, part of this is because Google is botching its supply train, but teething issues were to be expected. The message to take home from these issues is that there‚Äôs a demand for Google‚Äôs first phone. It is selling. Not at iPhone or Galaxy S levels, of course. Not yet. But anyone with a reasonable appreciation of the smartphone industry never expected it would. But I would definitely expect the Pixel 2 to sell better than its first gen sibling. Onward and upward. You‚Äôd be foolish to underestimate the second most valuable company in the world. Knowledgeborn Allah You're making some really good points... But I highly doubt Google is not trying to conquer the hardware space. They may be merging themselves into the hardware space, but dominating it? That kind of growth would eventually make them a virtual monopoly! They'd be shut down before they reached that point. There can be groundbreaking features of a device without them revolutionizing the way we use our devices. Based on your presentation, the only groundbreaking device on the market would be the BlackBerry KeyONE, since that literally changes the way someone would use their smartphone, at least a modern one. And, by the way, I'm not calling the Pixel a disaster in and of itself. I'm talking about its sales figures when compared to its competition. It's a pretty good device. I've had several issues with mine, and it's been far from perfect, but it's definitely not horrible. However, money is what matters at the end of the day. It's priced in the same range as the iPhone and Galaxy devices. Yet, it hasn't sold in numbers even remotely comparable to either of those. That's what I meant by it being a "disaster". whispy_snippet Apple has long dominated hardware. Why wouldn't Google aspire to be in this position one day? Why would Google be stopped when Apple wasn't? If Google sees an opportunity for growth that they're confident they can exploit they're almost obligated to go for it and provide returns for investors. Google may not ever reach a dominant position but I've no doubt its long term goal is to dominate. Just on the Pixel's sales figures, I'd reiterate that looking at gen one sales compared to the iPhone or Galaxy S is pointless. It really is. It's certain that many people still don't even know that the Pixel exists. What we need to keep an eye on is its growth. Will the Pixel 2 sell more than the first gen Pixel? Will the Pixel 3 do the same again? Will this growth be at the expense of Apple and Samsung market share? Just watch this space. I'm expecting it will definitely keep doing better in the years ahead. But it's going to be a fight. Knowledgeborn Allah I also think that the Pixel will see growth, year over year, at least initially. It's not going to be easy, though, regardless of Google's resources, because they're still going up against Samsung in the Android space. Personally, I think Samsung is going to crush the Android smartphone space for years to come, and there's not much Google can really do about that. The competing spaces, at least right now, are reserved for iOS and Android, and Samsung has gotten the dominant position in Android to become Apple's biggest competitor in the smartphone space. It took them years to get there, and I highly doubt they'd let that position be handed over to Google. The Pixel will be in a better position to secure the dominant position in the Android space if Samsung decides to start using their Tizen OS. Until then, Google will be fighting an uphill battle against Samsung, and they'll pretty much always lose. whispy_snippet We'll see won't we. Knowledgeborn Allah Indeed. Daishi Stop comparing it to an iPhone. Interesting point. When it comes to pricing the Pixel(s), they shouldn't be priced like an iPhone. Google doesn't have the nationwide support systems in place like Apple does. This is an argument for Apple's pricing for their phones. Why should the Pixel be priced as such without the same services??? Jarrett Lennon Kaufman They're at nearly the same level of services. Warranty replacement was intensely simple. Pricing is what it is. I can't argue it one way or the other. Reason was primarily to appear to be in the same class. It's psychological, and there's merit. But the entire point of this article was NOT that the iPhone is the better buy, which is why the comparison makes no sense to make. Daishi How are they at the same level of services? Of the 490 Apple stores in the world, the United States has 269 of them. Each offers not just sales of Apple merchandise including Macs, iPods, iPads, iPhones, Apple watches and Apple TVs, but service them at each one as well. This is the level of services I am talking about. Where are all the Google Stores where I can take a Pixel phone for servicing?? Google does not have this level of support anywhere in the world, so why should they price their gussied up Hold This Cat 10 phone like an iPhone??? Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà Because it was designed to look like an iPhone to make people believe it was worth what you'd pay for an iPhone. And it has G on the back. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Because, again, the warranty replacement process *without* a store is insanely simple. Simpler, since Apple generally requires you to rely on a store, and there are massive swathes of the country not near them. Also, you left out the word "nearly" to support your strawman counterargument. They're NEARLY at the same level. Also, you're lumping in unrelated things. We're talking about the Pixel, not the entire Android ecosystem. What other devices Apple supports through a store is irrelevant. And you can bring your Pixel to a UBreakIFix store for support, as well, FYI. Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà They're out of stock because nobody is buying them. I've seen comments about how they can't find them at Verizon stores. That's because Verizon only stocks phones that they can expect to sell. That's basic business sense. Knowledgeborn Allah That makes a lot of sense... But what about the online Google Store? Google won't even make them available to purchase online, as if HTC isn't even making them anymore. Kevin Aaronson Goddamn, those Bluetooth issues sound nightmarish. I would loose my mind! QueenLuLu So much this!!! I completely agree with this article. I currently have a Pixel, OnePlus 3T and LG G6 and despite all the great qualities the other phones have, I find the Pixel to be the most enjoyable and "complete" Android device I've ever used. And believe me, I have pretty much used them all! I want so much to love my G6 more, but it's impossicant. Better specs or no; the performance and be usability of the Pixel is awesome! I really hope Google steps up with the Pixel 2. If they did, I think it would really give this industry the kick in the rear it needs. whispy_snippet Great read as always, David. But I'm just wanting to ask some questions on the Pixel's Bluetooth performance. Is this just based off your own personal experience or have you got some data to indicate this is a widespread problem? I own a Pixel and use Bluetooth all the time. I listen to podcasts and music over Bluetooth headphones on my daily train commute, I sometimes use my portable Bluetooth speakers outside when I'm having a BBQ or a coffee on my deck, and my 2017 Subaru Impreza has Android Auto - which as I understand uses Bluetooth to transmit audio. Has there been the odd hiccup? Sure. But on the whole Bluetooth performance with my Pixel has been perfectly fine. No stutters, no disconnections, no nagging drop outs and relatively quick connection times. Obviously this is just my personal experience, but if I'm reading your review correctly, the problems you mention seem limited to your experience also. Maybe your accessories and not the phone are the main culprit? I just think Bluetooth sucks in general, personally. Taco Monster At least with my Mazda 3, my wife's Z3C is much much more reliable than my XL, which craps out a lot (see my other comment on this thread). I've found it to be okay with speakers and BLE devices like our August lock. whispy_snippet Hmm I'm a little sceptical about Mazda and their reputation for mobile consumer tech. They're still not officially onboard with Android Auto and Apple Car Play - instead they're still pressing their notoriously buggy and clunky MZD connect in-house system. I'm speculating, but they seem a bit "head in the sand" if you ask me. thetimmysmalls They recently announced Android Auto and Apple CarPlay to come to most of their Mazda Connect systems... At some point. whispy_snippet Yeah I did see that. Promising. But we'll see. Brian Wolters When the Pixel first came out, it would often lock up and sieze my car stereo system to the point where I actually had to turn the car off for 2 minutes and then get it back on. It was frustrating to say the least. With the recent updates to the Pixel, I've not encountered this. whispy_snippet Nasty! What car do you have? Brian Wolters 2016 Jeep Cherokee with Uconnect. It hasn't happened since recent updates. It was so bad, I used another phone until it was known it was fixed. My name is‚Ä¶. Damage control??? Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà Google could draw a picture of a phone in crayon and sell it as the Pixel XL 2, charge $1,200 for it, and most web magazines would rate it the best phone of 2017. It's self-preservation. And then once you've done that, you can't admit you were wrong. That would not only be embarrassing, it would be biting the hand that feeds you. Tr3ple But do you have one Johny M It's called Appleing it. me me It's the 7 stages of grief after the Nexus 5. Wondering when the press stop writing words about the once-was-interesting Google products. Keith Stefanec Never experienced any of these Bluetooth problems that were mentioned. Single downward speaker sucks. Hopefully, the Pixel 2 will have a bigger screen like the Nexus 6. wjrandon Did you Google make you guys post this? I bet they did!!!! Taco Monster For your Bluetooth woes in the car, at least with my Mazda 3, force stopping Bluetooth Share under Apps does the trick for me. I've even set up a Tasker profile to do this automatically every 12 hours. üò§ I figured this out after resetting the car to factory settings a couple of times. Grey I think these phrasings are disingenuous. My Nexus 6P is the best smartphone I've ever used - it's bigger, it's thinner, it's faster (though I am currently sucking all the RAM out of it and it's constantly freezing up - but my Nexus 4 did that too) than my Nexus 4. That doesn't make it a phone I'm happy with. There's features missing I'd like to have. There's design choices I disagree with. Saying "This is the best phone I've ever used" doesn't at all mean "This is a great phone". Jeff Beck When you have used pretty much every mainstream Android device ever, as David has, it's not a bad compliment. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman ...it kind of does mean that, actually. Unless literally every phone you've ever used is utter crap. But considering who's writing the article, he's used pretty much everything. "Best phone I've ever used" does translate to "this is a great phone." 4Ui812 That picture is so apropos for the title of the story. (If you don't know what I'm trying to say you can ask) brenden gonzalez Loved the article David I agree I got the the pixel from Verizon pre-ordered it and got it the day before I went on sale I've recommend the pixel to everyone I know my parents switched to them my brother and sister did to and I got some friends to switch to it as well and we all love the software experience it's so amazing!! Best phone I've ever owned it's also the longest I've ever owned a phone in 2016 before the pixel came out I had 6 new phones in a year and never did I find one that I liked and wanted to stay on I've tried them all to HTC to Samsung to even apple and LG and sony and I can't put the pixel down! I can't get a new phone even after seeing the s8 I would recommend and buy a pixel any day over the S8 Plus I no like edge on screen hell no!!!!! I would break it and be mad so that phone is too breakable for me! Nigel Antonio I kinda agree, accept I haven't ever gotten any bluetooth issues, i've been in a case since day one, and I don't see wear and tear on the back panel.... I recommend this phone to everyone, but don't go buying it now unless you have an extra 1k burning a hole in your pocket then go ahead.... but I await the next version of the pixel xl 2017, should be dope. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman A few thoughts/counters, in both directions, from my own experience: 1. I have had NONE of these Bluetooth problems you described with any device, including several different headsets as well as my car. I can travel notable distances from it, work out with it, and no disconnects. BUT, I have a Pixel, not an XL. Could that somehow be a factor? 2. Warranty service, for me, was exemplary. Yes, there was a credit card hold, but I'm used to that for advance exchanges. Otherwise it was a 10-minute process via chat, the replacement arrived in two days and was flawless, and thanks to the overall Pixel backup/restore process, the transition was painless. Easiest warranty exchange ever. Also, she allowed me to decide, on my own, to skip going through a factory reset as we both felt I'd done enough of my own troubleshooting. 3. Now the bad one: my Pixel freezes on me semi-regularly. On the one I replaced it was sometimes several times a day, but on the replacement, after about two weeks of use, it's as much as once a day, as infrequently as once every two days. Full-on hard freeze necessitating holding the power button until it reboots. NOT good. Never had this happen before or anything like it on a previous phone. Clearly, if it survived the warranty replacement, it's an app causing it. But how can an app consistently freeze up the entire system to this degree? What's not preventing that? And why is there no easy way to troubleshoot that? This is really bugging me and is the only thing damaging what's an otherwise stunning, stellar phone that's my favorite of all time. Only other disappointment for me is not having an XL which is what I wanted at launch, but the store approved me for just under enough money to get a 128GB XL. I had to choose between 32GB XL or 128GB non, and 128GB was (and still is) more important to me. But I'd rather have the better battery life and higher-res screen for VR. Still, all-in-all, and especially if I can resolve the freezing issue, this is the best phone imaginable, and its limitations are nothing compared to its heights. But yeah... at this point, wait for the next one if you're buying a phone now. Toby Beveridge I have the 5" Pixel with the daydream VR headset and I don't have any issues.. the screen is good enough for me.. way better than my note 4 or s6 Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Cool. Not for me. The pixel density is a serious problem for my enjoyment. Ismail Akram I have bluetooth issues he mentioned and I use Airpods with my Pixel XL.. so I thought its Airpods problem with Android(cuz I rarely use that with iPhone) About freezing it happened to me when I was on beta but after beta I don't remember freezing on Pixel XL ( but it was annoying in the start and I was so dishearted ) I recently had to sell either iPhone 7+ or Pixel XL (so I can buy S8+) and I sold iPhone 7+ :-p cuz iPhone is so easy to get Niall Murray I have the same freezing problem. Often my phone will unknowingly reboot in my pocket too. gizak No BT issues here either and I use BT in my car and headphones daily. As for your freezing, I experienced this too... after some extensive google searching, I narrowed it down to an app or two causing it. Mainly, any older app that uses your GPS periodically to poll for your location. Check apps that use GPS and haven't been updated since the latest version of Android, they may still be accessing the GPS directly instead of asking the android system for location (the newer more efficient way). Wendy By "latest version of Android", do you mean any app that hasn't been updated to Android 7+ software? My phone has been freezing every few days or so, so I'd like to try this suggestion. Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà Are you talking about the Pixel? I'm curious if these apps freeze other phones with Nougat. Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà Wouldn't this mean that every other phone running Nougat would freeze up when running these apps? Have you heard of anything like that? gizak Hmm, ya, you would think so. I'm not a code monkey, so this was just a hunch. The forums I came across linked it back to a family locator app causing the freezes and mentioned GPS access as the culprit. For me though, it was the WebMD allergy app that periodically polled my location to provide pollen count that froze my Pixel up daily. When I uninstalled it, my freezes seemed to go away. Wendy I'm getting the freezing error as well. I've requested for a replacement, so I'm hoping that will solve the issue. It's been freezing every so few days or so, not as frequent as yours. motoridersd The only odd Bluetooth issues I have had with this phone are related to it turning off randomly, and it has only done it a handful at times since I got it 6 months ago. I can put the phone in a drawer, walk into another room at the other end of my house, and I get no audio dropouts. Works perfectly fine in the car too. The only time I've had annoying dropouts has been in crowded airport terminals where there are a ton of competing 2.4 Ghz signals interfering and I have the phone in my pocket on the opposite side of the receiving circuitry of my BlueBuds X. Even then, it's a quick blip and it returns. Bluetooth IS much worse with The Dash, but that thing has its own issues and it happens with any other Bluetooth device I use. Maybe the BlueBuds X just have great performance that make up for the Pixel's shortcomings. Jordan I have the regular Pixel 32GB on Verizon. I have had absolutely none of the issues you describe, though Bluetooth is weak, in that if myself or my dog are in the direct line of sight between the device the speakers/headphones, it will cut out. But I have had no issues with the bluetooth in my infotainment in my car (my S6 & S7 did make me reset it a few times, however). Other than the locked bootloader (-_-) it is the perfect device! whispy_snippet A friend asked me the other day whether he should get a Pixel. I said yes. Most "normal" people don't want to wait around for months to see what the next processor is, or whether the screen on the next generation of phones has a slightly better display to bezel ratio, or whether the fingerprint scanner is going to be on the front or back. They just want something that has all the apps they use and works well. The Galaxy S8 has more hardware bells and whistles than the Pixel, but if history is any indication, the Pixel is going to be much nicer to use over the life of both devices. And ultimately, user experience trumps everything if you ask me. Especially for the non-techie. King_Android And it's a good thing they don't read the AP site either. David is speaking to his audience i.e. us nerds, not normal every day consumers. disastrousrainbow Exactly this. Having worked at Verizon for many years, giving Joe Consumer the tech enthusiast viewpoint on why they shouldn't go with a phone that's a few months away from being replaced rarely worked. More so if they were replacing a damaged or lost phone. In a situation like that, I would wholeheartedly recommend the Pixel over any other phone right now point blank dot com. Even with the S8 out. Of course, this would only be the case if they said they wanted, say, the best camera around. Or wanted a reliable software experience, etc. Those keywords would instantly bring the Pixel to mind, and I wouldn't feel bad about sending them off with one because 9 out of 10 times when the next model comes out, they will really not care, especially if their phone is still working well. When it comes to your every day man, it's not the tech enthusiast you should be listening to when recommending something, but rather the needs of the person you're trying to help. Midnitte "When it debuted in October, the Google Pixel XL cost $770. The one you and I actually want, the 128GB model, cost $870. Six months later, the Pixel XL still costs $870. Is it worth it? Hah. No." Google is insane if they think a phone holds on to value that long. Considering all the high profile phones that have released after it, you'd think they would consider a price cut. MJ You have never taken an economics class huh? Supply and demand ring a bell at all? Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà That's why you can't buy one. No demand, no supply. MJ I think have seen you troll enough on AP now. BLOCKED Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà LOL!! K77bkny Loooool people getting emotional over this bullshit device.... https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/649f431458908833d91263af6250ee8fbce01c1c6c9d7ca37827b1f65883a97e.gif Midnitte Six months sounds more like supply chain problems, not supply and demand. It's absolutely ridiculous that we're months away from the Pixel 2 and the Pixel 1 still costs $870 in the face of the Galaxy S8 and G6. Like the article, why would anyone recommend the Pixel 1 at $870 today? MJ It is a supply chain problem but that's irrelevant. The fact is the supply is not meeting the demand. Why would Google reduce the price on the phone? People are still buying it at that price regardless of what David, you, or I think about it. Cowboydroid After using a Pixel for several months, it is an insanely overpriced device. The only reason I own one is I got a great deal on it. Comparable performance and hardware can be had for less than half or even a third of the price. Sean People who write such things NEVER actually have a Pixel and are just haters. Those of us that actually have a Pixel (or XL) think they are superior to any phone we have ever owned........thanks for playing. Tr3ple You're so right about that. Cowboydroid Writing this from a Pixel XL right now, fanboy. Why get so emotional about a device? Debanjan Chowdhury I have been using alot of smartphones‚Äã. I used the OnePlus 3t, Nexus 6p, iPhone 7 plus, and even I have received the galaxy s8 plus yesterday. And I can surely say pixel xl will still be my daily driver. I am not a fanboy. I always support which works best for me. Yes, if Samsung had opted for a better camera, bigger battery and better fingerprint scanner position, I would have changed my daily driver to s8 plus. Good camera, snappy performance and stock Android are the priorities for me. And my pixel xl gives me all of these things. The Samsung galaxy s8 plus still has just little bit of hiccups here and there. But pixel xl, smooth 60fps all the time. And receiving updates at the earliest and it's unique update system works amazing for me. I would be really happy if it was water resistant. But I can't change my daily driver for only one benefit because pixel xl provides me dozens‚Äã other benefits than my Samsung galaxy s8 plus or s7 edge and‚Äã my iPhone 7 plus. Ismail Akram I had Oneplus 3 and I found Pixel XL to be more smooth and feels better than Oneplus. beside I love monthly security updates and loving that I can try android O( which I already did) and that Camera is really awesome. I think when Huawei can sell phones over $700 why not Google. (I would love if it was cheap but overall experience justifies that money for me) JD Man you need to raise your standards Sean Opinion: Even if you can, you probably shouldn't buy a Google Pixel anymore Winston David: Am I just a brainwashed Google fanboy (don't answer that question)? Yes. No. Probably. Maybe. Unlikely. Believable. Not sure. I'm a rebel. Andrew I know it's nitpicking but. I think you missed an 'us'. 'The Hardware' section, 2nd paragraph, last sentence. "...but I think it's safe to say most of want more screen where we can get it." Vivek Rameses Nobody is buying that piece of shit anyway. This is laughable. AndrewGM Good review, although if it's really the best smartphone you've ever used, then isn't it worth the premium price? Personally, I'm willing to pay another $100 or so for a phone I will use often, every day, for a couple of years and really enjoy using. The extra money in the end is nothing. I bought a used Pixel on eBay, so I saved about $50, but I really like it and am happy to pay a bit extra. The camera is great -- better than the iPhone, which I switched from. ddevito Remember when Android Police was an honest unbiased, tech savvy site? Alex Completely agree. Best phone I've ever owned, by far. Smooth as butter. Google just needs to work on their audio apis, along with other stuff. chumpatrump ive had a p6 huawei for 5 months and its feckin awesome. android like its meant to be - fast, stable, solid, easy to use, 36 hour charge TechGuy22 It's fine for what it is. I like mine. I still prefer my s7e over it. Maybe pixel 2 will better Vic Chai Was Nexus 6P your number one choice? Jon I've only ever connected to a Bluetooth speaker but never had a single Bluetooth issue ever.. Captain On! To whomever has a problem with the "don't buy this phone" line: if you're going to spend nearly $1000 on the Pixel, you're shortchanging yourself by not waiting less than half a year to spend the same amount on an upgraded device; you'd just be flat-out fiscally irresponsible. The 1st Gen Pixel will be a fine purchase after the Pixel 2 comes and the Pixel 1 goes on sale. At that point, it's fair game. You can save money and get a good experience, or you can pay more and get a great experience (relative). kaladdin I have had the Pixel XL since the launch. Yes, it is overpriced but the software experience alone makes it the best Android phone. P.S. I have never had any issues with the Bluetooth. Jago1908 Sorry, I just wasted some time here. I have my Moto X Play for one year now and it feels just as good as the time when I bought it. You're not selling it well. Give us a bit more. You're just leaving it personal. I prefer to use a cheaper phone that is as consistent as the Pixel. There are plenty. Come on! AhmedAlalfy Well why am I surprised ! A site as big as Android Police has to still suck it just not to piss off a company like Google. Well you could have deleted your (opinion article) better than making a fool of yourself like that. I know you said it's a good phone but these two articles in this order are just wrong. Be a man and stand for your words next time or just don't talk if you're afraid you're going to piss someone's off. I'm sound like hating I know but that's how I see it anyway take it or leave it. ‚Ä¶ I have a regular pixel.. it's awesome. Very consistent. Zero issues. No Bluetooth issues either, and the range is far superior to the Galaxy s7 we have to, so is the audio quality. Almost all his complaints I have never experienced, maybe it's a pixel xl thing? Idk.. and my battery life, is amazing compared to every other phone I have owned. I use a fair bit, and it lasts full day, usually still have 35-40% by 1am.. I stream music on and off all day, apps, surf, video.. usual stuff. No issues with slow finger print scanner either. It's bloody instant. I've owned Windows phones, and many "high end" android phones, and the pixel is the most reliable, most consistent phone I have had. I would buy again hands down. I'll take a product that just works right every time over bells and whistles. Yes make improvements, of course, but it really is the best overall phone I've ever used. Amit Raj I have been using the XL for about the same time...aside from the Warcraft struggle to get the phone, I agree with everything pointed out here. I do get these odd feelings to switch phones to the S8+ but I have no regrets with this phone. Having come from a flavoured android device (S6 Edge), I can vouch for the Pixel's fluidity, and consistency in performance. The only spite I have is the lack of android releases post 2018. Even Apple updates their devices that are nearly 5 years old. Why can't Google?! I can understand why any of the other ostensible android device manufacturers wouldn't rather can't update their devices to the latest android OS...hell they release devices like Rabbits reproducing. But for Google, come on you come out with 2 devices in a year and you can't give us atleast 4 years of android OS updates...leaving aside this rant, I really think you really get the real experience of having a smartphone...i.e. Android really puts the "smart" in smartphone and running it in its native state and on the Pixel it really outshines any other mobile OS to date...hands down....P.S. the Google keyboard could really get some AI updates for suggestions...other than this and the android OS upgrades, I'm a happy camper... Akshay Mehta Has anyone talked about the unlimited storage available in photos app ? I've shot photos and videos of more than 12GB since I got my pixel xl 6 months back. The camera and a consistent battery has just pushed me take so many photos! Even though I want to switch to s8, I can't. I'll just wait for pixel 2. Even though there have been numerous issues with the phone I still love it! Niero Gonzalez Buy it used. You can get a 32gb pixel for $400 on ebay, unlocked. Probably $300 when the new one is released. Unless you're an Android journalist there's no reason to buy an $800 phone unless you really want to show off your sushi photos Ryan Gray What's killing me is the screen burn in. Go watch a youtube video with a primarily solid color. Buttons and notifcation bar cant be unseen. Alisi Google any phone that has an AMOLED display about burn in. blindexecutioner I prefer the OnePlus 3T to the Pixel I sold. Never thought I would say that but I just don't care for the UI choices Google is making. Having the fingerprint scanner on the front along with capactivie buttons is really nice as well. Debanjan Chowdhury I also have a pixel xl and I love it. Debanjan Chowdhury Triggered Samsung fanboys, incoming. Debanjan Chowdhury I am using a pixel xl too but I never had Bluetooth problems‚Äã like you‚Äã. OK Google detection never broke for me. I didn't have to replace it or anything like that. And I am happy to be in India because the low stock issue is not here. blueman24 No way I'm buying a 57k phone. Especially when its available in the US for more than 10k cheaper while still being overpriced. Peter Silie Why do you Keep talking about the 128GB version as the version "you and I actually want"? I wouldn't even know what to do with that much space on my phone. I'm on a 32GB N5X with a s**tload of apps installed and a lot of downloaded Play Music titles and I still got 10GB of space. So no, the version I actually want would be the 32GB non-XL Pixel ;-) Alisi Do you play games? Have daydream? I've already had to do the "you don't have to go home, but you can't stay here" dance several times with my 32Gb. Leroy Filon The stock availbabilty is insane. I live in the Netherlands and it's not even out here yet. I drove to Germany back in november to get it. People ask me a lot about my phone when they see my mobile pictures on instagram and i'll tell em it's the Google phone with pride. But it's a shame i can't share this epicnes with fellow owners here in the Netherlands. Michael S√∏rensen "I rarely really get annoyed using it." Really? "The Bluetooth connectivity sucks. The back of the phone has very obvious wear rub. The glass window scratches easily. It's not waterproof. 'OK Google' hotword detection breaks for no apparent reason, necessitating a reboot (...takes a minut-plus...). The fingerprint scanner is slow..." Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà LMAO... like I said, he didn't even list all of the flaws. If that's the best phone he's ever used, he set the bar incredibly low. I can't even imagine what worse phones he was comparing it to. Maxr1998 Well, G6, S8? They do some things better, but he says the Pixel is better at other things, so in the end it wins. 3223 I dunno about you guys, but from what I read almost all reviewers cannot grasp exactly why it is better than other phones, other than 'it just is'. They can say it is smoother, and faster and all that, but hard data doesn't seem to back up that claim and they rubbish synthetic benchmarks over some abstract claim. I'm starting to see that having a G at the back of the phone, just like an apple logo, may have a placebo effect on its own, bringing people some good vibes, just like nexii phones in the past. Which makes for an interesting read or research as to how brands can affect perception. Jan Ibrahim No. ƒ∞t's nothing to do with placebo. There are very real significant improvements in touch latency which make a huge difference to your experience. ƒ∞t's not a commonly spoken about feature or spec, which is why a lot of reviews might not know why the phone feels better. But that's the main thing. 3223 That's the thing. Touch latency is a very common issue on android. And tbh I've been using an HTC 10 which reviewers mentioned when it launched that they tried to reduce touch latency by quite a lot. Additionally if i remember correctly the htc m8 (which i also used before) was regarded as having low touch latency as well. So why is it that when other manufacturers do it, it's kinda swept under the rug but when the goog does it, it becomes the coming of the messiah? You're right though, that there should be more definite tests on touch latency, coz I'll only believe it when I see the numbers.. Theuntje How can you love the camera? Doesn't your main camera sucks in recording video? Looks even like that my front camera is better at capturing video.. Michael S√∏rensen Can someone please link to a video showing off this legendary fluidity compared to others? Why is it so difficult to actually show when it's apparently oh so obvious? David Newman I'd be interested to see how they compare to the MI Mix, my guess is not very well ü§î roberto.elena Here is an idea for the next poll: Does David suffer dissociative identity disorder or is he just a troll? 1. Definitely DID 2. Definitely troll. 3. Even if you can, you shouldn't read everything he writes. 4. All he writes, including his personal Twitter, is gospel to me. Peter World Citizen This is the way I see it ... 1. David said don't buy the Pixel now 2. His Google tipster said he/she didn't like what he had said 3. David quickly back pedals with this article :) Kostas üí™üé© you obviously didn't read it till the end Daishi Or at all... BeholdersEye I don't understand why there is no stereo speakers! Damnit Google, you're‚Äã pushing the damn daydream view vr set then you don't put speakers on top and bottom (left/right in landscape mode), so BS! Google better offer trade-in for upgrade phone! And I certainly don't care for the extremely short software update deadend of only to 2018! We paid big bucks we deserve longer support!!!! Randy Gindy Everyone kind of dropped stereo speakers. Its really been replaced with a half assed version of stereo on some phones. Bottom firing and using the earpiece. username_not_valid I can only assume you havent used any other phone ever then. Nothing else makes logical sense. Jeff This is absolutely one of the worst phones I have ever used. It just had great marketing. For close to $1000 no Ir blaster to control remotes, people complaining about sound distortions, horrible and tedious screenshot capabilities and I don't think it charges fast at all. I'm going back to Samsung as soon as the note 8 is available. Cakefish October can't come soon enough! I need a Pixel 2 for the buttery performance, the amazing camera and the fast updates. Meanwhile, I'm stuck with the Galaxy S7, a great phone no doubt, but one that is showing signs of ageing (oleophobic coating wearing off, a battery that doesn't last as long as it used to and Android updates that come once in a blue moon). glebosotov Nice comment with funny mistype(is that how it's called?). BUTTERY more like battery Alisi Maybe he meant buttery as in smooth? glebosotov Maybe. Anyway, I think that most of us don't speak English as native language, so it's ok Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà I don't know if other OEMs have this problem, but I suspect pre-S8, Samsung batteries have been notorious for aging quickly. Even my Note 4 battery died way before it should have. The only good thing is I didn't have to take it to a shop to get it replaced. Patrick Smithopolis The camera and the smooth and consistent performance is why I don't have the urge to get a new phone. someone755 Long-term? Fuck man, it hasn't even been a year. The fact that you need to point out how well it's held over less than half its already limited lifetime can mean only one of two things; Either you're trying to compensate for the fact that the phone isn't as good as you'd hoped it would be (which may or may not be related to its inflated price), or you indeed are a head-over-heels Google fan. For all the shit I defend you against, David, I expected better of you. alcor86 Why the hell don't people put phone cases & screen protectors on their phone? I do that right out the box. Peter Ebenezer I agree, I love the pixel. But every single person I've talked to about it, I've told to not buy it. Purely for the Bluetooth issues. My galaxy S2 I had before this had rock solid Bluetooth but was incredibly old so needed to modernise and was fed up of manufacturers that delay updates by adding bloatware.. The pros outweigh the cons. But the con is a big one... Not to mention the fact they are on about spitting out the next one already... chris My z5 just hit a reboot disaster I picked up a pixel xl 128gb for $950 aus, best phone I've ever used and no dramas with Bluetooth after first week, I was holding out for pixel 2 but didn't make it.. I'm happy with my buy anyway , it's a brilliant phone , buy off eBay not a store and save $300 that's my advice.. What supply issues lol GregAndo Thanks, I have pretty much had every Google phone phone since the Nexus One, and whilst also loved the form factor the Bluetooth issues, Battery issues and OS bugs pushing me to weekly reboots were more than I could handle. So I took the S8+ after the note 7 went back... and skipped the Pixel XL. So glad I did, I had the same issues and they infuriated me in the end. When Google finally gets the build of Android out that focuses out these bugs...I might go back. Tool then i am happy with the S8+ so far, I hope it is more reliable. Keg Man Waiting to hear from the note 7 owners. Most of us thought that was the perfect phone despite the one manufacturing defect Kakairo This matches my experience with the Pixel XL, with the exception of wear and tear (probably due to the slim Spigen case I put on it). With the Bluetooth, though, I wonder if it's an issue with Mazda Connect (I know you drive a Miata, David, I have a Mazda 3). I haven't had any issues with Bluetooth headphones, and I've had two rental Nissans in the past month that worked without issue for over a week. Would I buy it again? Yes, absolutely. Would I buy one right now? No, for the simple fact that the S8 has now surpassed it and that Pixel 2 can't be too far away. sam1331 Uh, the Pixel XL is a big phone. The Pixel is even a big phone, bigger than the iPhone 7 in every single dimension. They sell an iPhone SE that is significantly smaller and people buy it. My point is that, claiming no one should consider the Pixel because the Pixel XL isn't too big isn't an opinion, it's "lunacy". Rod iPhone 7 is 4.7" Andre Meaux Yep! Still love my Pixel (XL)!! Looking for the Pixel XL 2! destinyhud cant wait for the pixel 2. its going to be even more awesome. it will be a day one buy for me Rod There's one thing I wonder about the Pixel: in those PhoneBuff "speed tests" the Pixel is always put to shame when it doesn't hold more than 4 apps in background. However, in this one, it was able to hold 13 apps, being 4 of them, games. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ugcpul8nYg) Who's telling the truth, afterall? mattcoz I had issues with Bluetooth cutting out with my headphones, but then I turned off "phone audio" and it has been perfect. I have noticed that the signal will get weak if I sit on it, but uhh, yeah that makes sense, so I don't do that. Jordan L just this morning, for the first time ever my car would not connect to my Pixel. damn it. Rod David's curse Mike I must have a Pixel XL that is the diamond in the rough. I have a travel job, meaning I'm in rental cars several times a month. I have never once had bluetooth connectivity issues, for real. Henry S. Maybe it's just me but I don't understand this need to go YUuuuuGe with screens anymore. We've reached the point of usability and carrying the damn thing. 5" was the sweet spot for me as a phone. If I want media, I'll watch on my tablet. My perfect phone size was the old Droid MAXX(also a 5" phone). Most of the points make sense. I get the same battery life as you on my OG Pixel except Bluetooth. Only exception is switching between devices on my wife's small Bose speaker and we always have problems no matter the phone so it's not just the Pixel. Xenios Kofteros Got a full refund for my 1.5 year old Nexus 6P for the known battery issues. I'd very much like to buy a Pixel XL, but the price for new and used are ridiculous. Hopefully Google will break tradition and reveal Pixel 2 at Google I/O. Or else I'm going the OnePlus 5 way and break 4 years of Google phone use tradition. ClikFire _ I haven't had any of the issues you mentioned except the issue with hairline scratches because I hate using cases. SoI covered the glass windows with a Matte Black Dbrand Skin and found a Tempered Glass screen bezel which actually transformed the Dark Grey Bezels to true black bezels and covered up the scratches in the process. Also coming from an S7 edge I actually really like the Design of the Pixel personally especially the back with the Glass window, makes it stand out from the rest. If the Pixel 2 looks like this and adds front facing speakers and water resistance I'm game. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/842173829c88496d628fe9ecdf0b77f65995d3ca89cb1a2d93e7896ad2c760f1.png Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà If Google continues the current trend in its phones, it's more likely to look like this. ;) https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/6945f5a7bc54ba27628971ea239b5d6ee5d8f0bb2b8aa844f6e67a2d6ec05c12.png Rod I was about to burst in laughter, then I thought this may actually happen. Ozl Never had any problems with my 128GB Pixel, still works great! krkn I got the Pixel 128GB when it came out because I had a Note7, which I loved, and the XL was unavailable. Despite the smaller size, I have still really enjoyed the phone. Like you said, it remains snappy and the better life good, and sometimes I actually appreciate something that fits in my pocket so nicely. Photos are terrific. My main gripe is the speaker location, which is blocked easily in landscape mode, but that's a small nit since if I really need better sound, I'll be plugged in or using a Bluetooth speaker. Randall Collins I have the XL and I haven't had quite as many issues with mine but it really is a great phone despite all that. No lag, smooth, and the first to get updates with no crazy UI to destroy the experience. And I updated from an iPhone 6+ which had all those same attributes. No phone will ever be perfect but for now, the XL works for me. likurges if the phone was so great as it's bezzels it would be the best phone ever Randy Gindy At least I have something to hold onto when I watch a video. likurges yes because a phone is a heavy thing and doesn't have corners. thank god for the bezels of the pixel. also think for example if you hear some shocking news, you can hold to those bezels and they might as well save your life JR I'd have no problem recommending either of the Pixel devices to potential buyers, today. Many buyers enter the market for a new phone, because they need one. If you're one of those people who only updates their device when the current one is on its last leg, then the Pixel is an outstanding option (six months isn't something many would care to wait). The casual buyer primarily needs a good experience, preferably over a long term, and as discussed in this article, the Pixel delivers this quite well, 'right now' (to be fair, that's *if* you can find one). If the price drops once the Pixel 2 launches, even better. If you're talking to enthusiasts, then we can push this a few ways, but we always have the option to sell the Pixel, should we desire the new shiny thing. The Nexus 6P (still a great phone) fetches nice prices in the aftermarket, and the Pixel is generally understood to be an even better phone. I'm sure the Pixel will command a fine (but lower than new) aftermarket price, and there will always be a set of buyers who can't afford the absolute latest, but will be willing to scoop one up at a more realistic discount. So unless the device is missing game-breaking, hard features you rely on (waterproofing, because you're a part-time lifeguard), then I think it would be acceptable to recommend it. Fastguy77 This article makes no sense. I purchased a pixel brand new for half price, best decision ever. Phone is amazing. So by all means, find someone selling it below MSRP and grab it. Waiting half a year because 'you'll regret' not having the newest is typical tech buyer stupidity. So, just wait and never buy a product, cause around the corner is the next better version... xyz "Is the XL worth $770 to pick up today?" Wasn't worth it even at release!

You can get our headlines via email as well, or follow us on Twitter. Hackers have developed a new scam involving Google Docs that was widely reported this week. The attackers send out emails containing a fake link to Google Docs, purportedly from one of your contacts. On the surface, the document doesn‚Äôt appear to be suspicious but anyone who clicks on it could see their Gmail account hacked. Once the link is clicked on, users will be directed to what looks like a Google login screen, TechSpot reports. But, the scammers are able to gain access to users‚Äô personal information when they click on that link as it grants permission to Google Docs to ‚Äúread, send, delete and manage your email‚Äù, and also managed your contacts. Even worse is that the link directs users to a genuine Google login page, so there‚Äôs no weird URL to give away the fact it‚Äôs a scam. There are some ways to tell though. USA Today displayed an example of an email between a bogus Google Docs invitation versus a real one. The blue logo and the words are slightly different. For instance, the real Google Docs invites you to ‚Äúedit‚Äù a document and will use the blue Google Docs logo next to the doc name. However, the scam email doesn‚Äôt include the name of the document or use the Google Docs logo. Google said it‚Äôs already disabled accounts associated with the attacks and removed the fake login pages, in order to counter the attack. If you think you‚Äôve already been duped by the scam, Google recommends going to your ‚ÄúConnected Apps and Sites‚Äù settings and revoking privileges from the Google Docs app. Also, be cautious of any emails that ask to share a Google document, even if it appears from a trusted contact. Check with the sender first to make sure it‚Äôs legitimate. The New York Times offers more tips on what to do if you think you‚Äôve clicked on such an email. These so-called phising scams are rapidly becoming more common. Last year, the Federal Trade Commission and the National Association of REALTORS issued a warning to customers about a mortgage closing phishing scam that dupes buyers into depositing their down payment into a fraudulent account. The scam hacks into real estate professionals‚Äô email accounts and targets their customers with misleading information. About Mike Wheatley Mike Wheatley is the senior editor at Realty Biz News.

Top News U.S. News World News Voices Entertainment Movies Music TV Odd News Defense Energy Sports Fantasy Football NFL NBA MLB NHL Golf Tennis College Football College Basketball Science Health Photos Latest Photos 2016 Olympics News Entertainment Sports Features Archives Archive The Almanac Search Home / Health News Web-surfing parents have less trust in pediatrician By Amy Norton, HealthDay News ¬†¬†|¬†¬† May 5, 2017 at 2:26 PM Follow @upi Comments FRIDAY, May 5, 2017 -- Health information gleaned online can alter parents' views on the advice they get from a pediatrician, a small study finds. These days, it's almost a guarantee that when kids develop a rash, fever or other worrisome symptom, parents will turn to Google, noted Dr. Ruth Milanaik, the lead researcher on the new study. Based on her team's findings, that web search may affect parents' trust in their pediatrician -- which is a concern. "Google is a fantastic tool, but it's not a doctor," Milanaik said. She's a pediatrician and associate professor at Hofstra Northwell School of Medicine, in Hempstead, N.Y. The study presented nearly 1,400 parents with a vignette of a child who'd had a rash and worsening fever for three days. The parents had at least one child, and the parents' average age was 34. The parents were split into three groups. One group was then given online information describing symptoms of scarlet fever, while a second group viewed information on select symptoms of Kawasaki disease. A third group of parents -- the "control" group -- saw no online information. All of the parents were told that a doctor had diagnosed the child with scarlet fever. In general, the study found, parents who viewed information on scarlet fever were more likely than the control group to trust the pediatrician's diagnosis. In contrast, parents who'd seen information on Kawasaki disease were more skeptical. Only 61 percent of parents in the Kawasaki group trusted the doctor's diagnosis -- versus 81 percent of parents in the control group. Almost 91 percent of parents in the scarlet fever group trusted the doctor's conclusion, the findings showed. Scarlet fever and Kawasaki disease do share certain symptoms -- namely, rash and fever. But they are very different conditions, Milanaik explained. Scarlet fever is a bacterial infection that requires antibiotics. Without treatment, scarlet fever can sometimes lead to serious complications, including heart damage. Kawasaki disease involves inflammation in blood vessels throughout the body. Doctors treat it with anti-inflammatory drugs -- both to ease the symptoms and to prevent damage to the heart. It's easy to see how parents presented with a description of Kawasaki disease would doubt a doctor's diagnosis of scarlet fever, according to Milanaik. Similarly, she said, any time parents Google a "collection of symptoms," they could turn up a confusing array of possibilities. So, Milanaik said, it's important for parents to ask their doctor about any online information they dig up. "Don't be afraid to do that," she urged. "I'd always rather have patients ask questions." Dr. Jefry Biehler, a pediatrician who wasn't involved in the study, agreed. "As doctors, we should welcome those questions," said Biehler, who heads pediatrics at Nicklaus Children's Hospital in Miami. "Actually," he added, "we're often happy to have this [online] information brought to our attention -- whether it's good or bad -- so we're aware of what's out there." But while parents should ideally ask questions, Milanaik said, it's just as important for doctors to be proactive. It's helpful, she said, if pediatricians explain their "thought process" behind a diagnosis, so parents have a clearer understanding for "why it's this, and not that." Doctors can also offer suggestions for trustworthy health-related websites, Milanaik said. Biehler agreed, and said many pediatricians do try to steer parents toward "reliable" sources, such as the websites of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the American Academy of Pediatrics. "We should also be asking parents if they need any more information, or clarification, from us," Biehler said. The study presented parents with a hypothetical situation, and didn't ask them about their actual online habits or trust in their own pediatrician, Milanaik acknowledged. But the study design, she said, allowed a more objective look at how online health information can sway people's thinking. Milanaik was scheduled to present the findings Thursday at the annual meeting of the Pediatric Academic Societies, in San Francisco. Findings presented at meetings are generally viewed as preliminary until they've been published in a peer-reviewed journal.

I couldn't disagree more vehemently. Yesterday's antitrust laws can't regulate today's technology, but they sure as heck can certainly destroy its profit potential. And, unfortunately, yours, too. Here's what you need to know‚Ä¶ and how to defend your money against government meddling. The Government Wants a Piece of Google Pie Jonathan Taplin is no slouch. In fact, he's a very bright guy who is the Director Emeritus of the University of Southern California's Annenberg Innovation Lab. Normally, I agree with him ‚Äì especially when it comes to Silicon Valley, which he characterizes as being populated by a bunch of spoiled, ignorant brats who are clueless when it comes to the consequences of their actions‚Ä¶ to which I'll add, "and their products." There is nothing more frustrating to me than knowing Google ‚Äì aka Alphabet Inc. (Nasdaq:¬†GOOGL) ‚Äì dominates today's digital world. Speaking personally, I hate the fact that every digital footprint I leave is tagged somewhere by some company unknown to me that's anxious to sell it to the highest bidder in an effort to "monetize" my behavior. And, while we're at it, I loathe the fact that the technology is increasingly being sold to medical providers, insurance companies, financial providers ‚Äì all of which are using it to deliver "targeted" advertising and services to me at prices that somehow always seem higher than they used to be. The very term is an insult. But having the government break Google up?! No way. At the end of the day, the only true monopoly is the government because it's the only entity capable of using force to intervene in otherwise free markets. The markets will take care of that all by themselves, and investors who are along for the ride will do very well by letting that happen instead of falling prey to out of touch regulators who don't understand what's going on. Take Google's browser, Chrome, for example. It's got an 88% market share of browser traffic because competing browsers like Microsoft's Internet Explorer stinks and Yahoo's ill-fated Axis stunk. Users selected Google because they liked it and found it valuable. The argument that antitrust regulation works on behalf of the consumer is a four letter word that I can't print. When you take a closer look, most of the people complaining about big monopolies are not consumers, but other suppliers who stand to benefit if there's enforcement action. Naturally, regulators will try to sell the breakup as a great story. Instead of trying to help existing and new companies develop, the government wants to compete by punishing the successful. They always have ‚Äì with railroads, with oil, with airlines ‚Äì and now they're going to do it with technology (and, if this idea gathers steam, with Alphabet Inc., specifically). People don't realize it, but the Justice Department, working in concert with a wide variety of Washington agencies, has canned a number of deals over the past few years, including Sysco Corp.'s (NYSE:¬†SYY) attempt to buy U.S. Foods, Comcast Corp.'s (Nasdaq:¬†CMCSA) attempt to purchase Time Warner Cable (NYSE: TWX), Staples Inc. (Nasdaq:¬†SPLS), and Office Depot Inc. (Nasdaq:¬†ODP), just to name a few. Things are so egregious that even Thai Union (OTCMKTS: TUFBY), which makes Chicken of the Sea, was stopped from buying Bumble Bee Tuna back in 2015, for crying out loud. Tuna fish! ¬†What Policy Wonks Are Missing The last thing a regulator should want to do is hobble one of the world's most successful companies. Doing so will squash innovation and destroy hundreds of billions of dollars in shareholder value ‚Äì much of which is in retirement plans. The numbers are hard to come by, but this is especially important when you consider that individual households may own as much as 80% of the corporate equity market when you combine the estimated 38% of stocks owned directly by U.S. households with the indirect ownership associated with mutual funds, pension funds, and insurance policy investments. I can all but guarantee that regulators haven't thought about how much wealth they'll destroy if they move ahead. And, of course, that's also part of the problem. Companies like Alphabet are completely changing the face of what we think about regulation, utilities, government, structure ‚Äì you name it ‚Äì specifically because they're unconventional, innovative, and empowering. Like the other companies in the so-called "Fabulous Five" we talk about frequently, Alphabet has become so integral to our lives that it's a "must-have." I'm not surprised in the least that the company rubs Washington's inner circle the wrong way because it bypasses what they consider to be the proper relationship between those who rule and those who follow. Big Companies Are Not Anti-Competitive ‚Äì Antitrust Laws Are Antitrust laws have their roots in the Sherman Act of 1890 and the Federal Trade Commission Act and Clayton Act of 1914, all of which are intended to ensure lower prices, efficient competition, and higher quality in the name of consumer protection.

I could buy phones when I wanted to and hook them up without having to pay a tech. to come out and charge me 2 hours to hook up 2 little wires. I personally think there should be more break ups. Bill Rogers Reply Keith | May 1, 2017 Good morning, Bill. Your point is very well taken. Thanks for taking a moment to chime in. Best regards and thanks for being part of the Money Map Report Family, Keith :-) Reply G13Man | May 4, 2017 and now they have re-merged over the years AT&T is dead [Southern Bell bought the name and remains of the carcass and they got cellular with it ] Verizon has moved into Cellular nationwide getting around the copper moats they used to all have ! And if you had stock in AT&T , you had a piece in all at the split and as they re-merged , good profit Reply Vincent Schreiber | May 4, 2017 Bill I was thinking about the ATT breakup as I was reading this, but it ocurred to me that ATT was actually a forced monopoly, followed by a forced breakup, so I don't think it applies as an example of a monopoly created by market forces, like MS, which has been consistently attacked by the DOJ, or Alphabet, which hasn't yet, but may be on the verge.

TECHNOLOGY Burger King's Ad Exposed Voice Assistants' Hackability A television ad was able to trigger Google Home devices. By¬†Mae Anderson AP Tech Writer WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Courtesy Company Advertisement Burger King pulled a pretty juicy marketing stunt last month that drew plenty of attention -- not just to the Whopper, but also to the intrinsic vulnerabilities of a new type of voice-activated gadget. The fast food chain's 15-second television ad targeted Google Home, a speaker that can answer questions and control other smart appliances. When an actor in the ad said "OK, Google" and asked a question about the Whopper, Google Home obediently began reading the burger's ingredients in homes around the country -- effectively extending the commercial for however long it took someone to shout "OK, Google, stop!" Google and Wikipedia quickly made fixes to shut it down. Though annoying, the stunt may have done some good by highlighting how easy it is to hijack such devices. (Just imagine a burglar spying a voice assistant and asking it to unlock all the doors.) It could also speed the development of home voice assistants with better security. "It's a wakeup call," said Earl Perkins, a digital security analyst at the research firm Gartner. "It's a harbinger of things to come." TRIGGER WARNING Voice assistants such as Google Home, Apple's Siri and Amazon's Echo devices have always been susceptible to accidental hijack. A Google ad during the Super Bowl that used the phrase "OK, Google" reportedly set off people's devices. And in a January story that briefly turned a family into media celebrities, a woman's 6-year old daughter ordered a dollhouse and sugar cookies simply by asking Amazon's voice assistant Alexa for them. Since the devices are so new -- the Amazon Echo debuted in 2015, Google Home last year -- they're still having growing pains. And they're growing in popularity; Consumer Intelligence Research Partners estimates that Amazon sold 3 million Echo devices in the U.S. in the fourth quarter of 2016, bringing the total to more than 8 million. Amazon doesn't release sales figures. Many experts believe that deliberate attempts to trigger voice assistants will be short-lived. Among other things, brands have to face the consequences of potentially annoying millions of people. "Burger King was doing what the Burger King brand is known to do, stir controversy and make sure it gets lots of coverage," Forrester principal analyst James McQuivey said. "Very few brands want to do that." Of course, spammers and other bottom-feeding marketers can still try to implement the technique. But voice assistants already have a few ways to block them. THREATS AND COUNTERMEASURES Amazon already makes sure its TV commercials and those of its partners can't inadvertently trigger the speaker. Developers that provide Echo with "skills" that let it, for instance, order pizza, are also prohibited from creating Alexa commands that would trigger ads. Google says it also has techniques to block TV ads from activating Google Home. Neither company provided details on those techniques. Voice assistants are still in their "very early days," Google says; the company plans to "monitor and learn as we go." Hackers might also be a threat. But because voice assistants are so new and limited in scope, more established connected devices such as webcams, routers and printers pose more of a threat for now. "It's not that we won't see some creative or unique instance (of hacking), but I don't think this is going to be the next great wave of cybercrime," said Steve Grobman, chief technology officer at the security company McAfee. MORE SECURITY TO COME But before long, the devices are going to need better security. "When you move into a world of voice, some of the rules that we're accustomed to, related to security for computers, change," Gartner's Perkins said. Exactly how that works could depend on exactly what task a voice assistant is performing. Asking about the weather requires less security than say, shopping or accessing a bank account. Amazon already has options for setting up security codes to shop, make financial transactions or unlock and start cars. Of course, someone could always overhear you reciting a security phrase. A better solution, and one that companies are hard at work on, would be to identify a person's voice, much the way Google and Facebook identify faces today. Beyond improving security, that technology could help the device personalize recommendations or even ads for the individual, not the whole family. Apple already lets users voice-train its Siri digital assistant so it's more likely to activate only when it hears a specific voice. Amazon has a voice training option for Alexa. Google Home can recognize up to six different voices, though it won't prevent unauthorized users from activating the assistant. Experts suggest that companies will eventually add cameras to voice assistants. Amazon's new Echo Look has a camera, but it's for offering fashion advice. Combining a facial scan with voice recognition would definitely beef up security, although they'll also create new privacy concerns. "Without any security or minimal security, (voice assistants are) going to be a fat target," Perkins said. "There will be all kinds of innovation associated with compromising these systems." --The Associated Press Published on: May 5, 2017 Advertisement

Chelsea will win the league with successive wins over Middlesbrough and West Brom. So there might be a heck of a party in a different area of London at this very time next week. First things first: where did West Ham pull that from? They deserved the win; it might help keep Slaven Bilic his job and it was the kind of performance the London Stadium just hadn‚Äôt seen before. Perhaps it will help make them feel at home. Either way, they were ‚Äúat it‚Äù from the start, had a goalkeeper in form when needed, and were very lively when going forward. Lanzini was marvellous and his goal was merited. From all areas of the side, it was a fine, diligent effort. Second things second: where did Spurs pull that from? It didn‚Äôt look like them at all. They had a handful of chances but never really looked convincing at all, were harried off the ball too easily and never really found the space to pick West Ham apart. They were also as wobbly at the back as they have been in a long time. Perhaps they were nervous: sometimes playing first out of two title contenders can bring its own pressure. And perhaps there was a signpost to this in a slightly messy win at Crystal Palace last week ‚Äì if we assume that the north London derby was an entirely different ballgame. There was no bit of genius from Christian Eriksen this time, and there will surely be no more twists and turns in this title race now. Dele Alli heads to the changing room at the end of the match .

They give general and abstract guidance on how to hire an SEO but to say, here are some SEOs we trust - that is rare. That just changed when Gary Illyes of Google posted on Twitter calling out six different SEOs as "excellent, helpful, long time." The context is that Gary read some SEO advice on the internet that was bad. Gary said, why don't you have other SEOs that are good out there peer review before you publish the stuff. So Gary called out six different SEOs as people you can ask for advice on your SEO articles. Here are the tweets: Just to name a few, in no particular order: @aleyda @randfish @dr_pete @Suzzicks @stonetemple @wonderwall7 2/2‚Äî Gary Illyes ·ïï( ·êõ )·ïó (@methode) May 5, 2017 I am sorry that so many of you didn't make the list. For those that did, congrats - let us know if this helps you with your consulting business. In any event, the point is valid - don't publish stuff about a topic you don't know much about. If you do, get an expert to review it and edit it. Forum discussion at Twitter.

Google is having issues with account sign-in, resulting in errors with Android devices, OnHub, and Wifi Phil Oakley Follow View All Posts 2017/02/24 5:48am PDTFeb 24, 2017 18 Plus 1 on G+ 184 Share on Facebook 91 Share on Twitter Total Shares293 Google News My Google account is the key to much of what I do online, so not being able to use it is a bummer. Since yesterday, many people have been having issues signing in to their accounts - we at Android Police have been seeing this across the US and Europe. However, Google has confirmed on the Product Forums that this is not the result of a hack or malicious activity. Google is aware of the issue, and has put a note up on the Google Play support page, saying "If you‚Äôve recently been signed out of your account, sign back in using your usual username and password at https://accounts.google.com. If you can‚Äôt remember your password or can‚Äôt sign in for another reason, go here to recover your account password. For security reasons, our support agents are unable to assist with password issues." According to Down Detector, the company is still having issues, although possibly not as widespread as before. However, the problems are not the result of a hack or phishing, so if you have been signed out, you shouldn't need to change your password, as your account is still secure. Google account issue, having been signed out of the account. Google has confirmed that this is what has been causing Google Wifi and OnHub products to reset themselves. This unfortunately means the devices need to be set up again. Google lists how you can tell if the device has been reset, and how¬†to re-set it up, on the support page. If you've recently been signed out of your Google account, sign back in here. Let us know in the comments what you've been seeing, and we'll try and keep you updated with any new developments.

Google account OAuth tokens stored by third-party apps that use Cloudflare could have been exposed. It's weird, too, since it also deauthed every app I was signed into, including Google Apps Script. It seems that something on your end went through every request you had in that data sample (and Google's cache), invalidated tokens if it found any, then prompted the user to sign in again. Like David, I'm just speculating, as I couldn't find anything related to this in my G Suite console as well." Ben Lee well said using your Google account may be, but this is direct login to Google itself, which would not be affected in itself. I only had the Google accounts logged out on the device, no specific apps were affected. My apps account and main Google account, 2 others went affected. Ivunsasu This happened to me last night. I didnt know what was going on. I thought I got hacked or something (even though my password didn't change). Checked all my credentials and everything was in-tact. Changed my PW anyways. Glad to know this is the cause. This happened for about 2 hours last night, then I restarted my phone, and things have been quiet since then. Bill D Same here - I guess a small side benefit is a lot of users updating their account passwords! Ivunsasu yep <3 drksilenc Same i use a yubikey for security though so a breach is unlikely. Swaminathan Guru Ran into this issue today on my Pixel, while at the same time I was signed in fine on my OP3 Andrew Ran into this on my s7 edge and chrome on desktop Suicide_Note I've not had any problems, but my wife noticed it on her Gmail. alexus I have same issue on nexus 6p & watch Tom√°≈° Petr√≠k Me and whole family had the issue last night. Ben Lee Had this last night on 2 of my accounts on tablet and mobile, very frustrating. I got scared and changed my passwords, thought someone was messing with my account. Glad I've discovered it was a Google issue. rjyanj Holy fuck. I thought my account had been compromised and my identity stolen! Glad I finally saw this 12 hours later. Adrian I had this happen last night. Signed back in and haven't had any problems since. It only happened on my phone though. They texted the code for me to enter, I did, and everything worked as usual. Milo Joseph Jesus google dont scare me like that.. I thought my life was over.. Scary how important a google account is HSidhu I know shadowx360 Good time to remind everyone that it's imperative to run two factor authentication on your main Google account. Google doesn't support security questions anymore so if someone takes your account, it's almost impossible to take your life back. Impulse_Vigil Set up a backup email/phone # and store those emergency codes too. Daniyyel Django Touboul wow I feel you, I was 90% sure that my account was hacked. Justin I got hit with the google home bug that prevents it from responding to anything, saying there's a problem or a glitch, and when I rebooted it, I had to unlink and relink my account. Thinking that having to sign in again is related to this as it hit my pixel yesterday afternoon and my chrome browser at home this morning. Weird. YaKillaCJ Ran into it last night on my Umi Super. Said changes has been made to my terms or something. So I need to login, but it wouldn't. So I backup after entering my password twice and I was never logged out. I was like hmm, I'll just monitor my account activity for a bit because I would rather not have to change my password. But this article is a relief. Stephane Sby Balmy Same, woke up with "sign in please" on my phone, i freaked out and i was about to factory reset my phone + change my password... Gonna do it anyway i think Wayne Randall Changing your password and then factory resetting your device _will_ lock it down, IIRC. Be particular in which order you choose. I'm certain I will be corrected if I'm wrong. Stephane Sby Balmy Thanks for the warning, the order i plan to use is PW change, then factory reset. 07070 I don't have this, last changed my account password 3 days ago though. bolski I've been seeing this apparently from my phone. I don't have any Google WiFi products, unless my Chromecast is one of them. Oatz Just knew I was hacked. Stop it Google! Playing with my emotions! Cinj Had the issue last night while using OGYoutube. I merely thought Google was finally blocking that app. thingswentworsethanexpected.jpg.exe Cai I was wondering why my phone asked me for my password again. üòÇ OmniWrench I would just like to add my voice to the "Oh that's what that was!" chorus. Thanks for the heads up, much appreciated... Plus this gives me a link to send to tech-support relatives as well. Gohan040 Happend to me yesterday evening in the Netherlands. First I noticed I google assistant didn't work properly on my pixel c, tho it worked on my Nexus 4 which I o ly use as a assistant in my bedroom. (No google home in the Netherlands sad enough) A few minutes later I noticed a notification from Google on my s6 edge. If I could sign in again, so I did with two step verification. Everything looks fine again at the moment. 8giggles The odd thing to me is that I'm logged into my account in my browser, both on my phone & office desktop. My phone/Google apps need me to sign back in & it's telling me there's been a CHANGE to my account. What change?! I didn't do any change. Did THEY do something? And if so, a heads-up would have been appreciated. But if there was a change to my account, why am I still logged into my Google acct online? The Zombie Hustler Exactly. I'm curious now as to what happened that caused this Travis Coble Completely forgot about that, same here. Upon review no event signifying a change could be found in account history. üòï Impulse_Vigil Same, I went to my security settings and checked it hadn't been logged in elsewhere or on other devices, it wasn't so didn't think much of it after that. Glitches happen, they should probably revise their stock messages and/or how these glitches are labeled at time of re-login tho. llf It's okay for us who know a bit about the Internet and we can search for the answer that "Google just logged you out, log in back and no panic." But, Google needs to know that some non-geeky people depend on their service too. I set up location service for my senior family members. And they were logged out. Then I lost their whereabout. Try to feel how I felt. üòï Just hope Google has learnt from this issue and avoid it in the future. 8giggles üòÆüò≤ That would have really upset me too! Steven Santinelli weird, only device that had issues was the nexus 5x. all the tablets were fine, S7 was fine, and wifi and home were fine... :) Jordan L I had the "change to your account" bug yesterday too, around 4:45pm EST. I basically had to sign into everythign thing again. My friend said he Google Authenticator 2step was not working either, codes were not accepted. (I'm guessing he had to remove and re-add it.) Feels like it's working now. really curious what happened. feels like an emergency hack response or something of that nature. HSidhu BiG Data leak at Google, Accounts hacked. Jordan L they would have forced password change, no? OR it's somekind of account token leak. just actually read the article above... Google would have said, "we are investigating a small, isolated security incident". right?! HSidhu no company will say that to keep their reputation, question to you why we know about the BIG data leaks after 2 years? example - Target, Yahoo (Yahoo was silent for 2 years). The Zombie Hustler I'm from India. Same thing happened to me last night. Changed my passwords on all the accounts and applied 2 step verification, thinking my account had somehow been compromised. Glad I'm not the only one lol Sean Thomas had to log in to all three google accounts I have on my phone last night. was weird. The Zombie Hustler So. What EXACTLY happened that caused this? Fred this actualy is Google's reaction to cloudbleed : https://blog.cloudflare.com/incident-report-on-memory-leak-caused-by-cloudflare-parser-bug/ Matt S. Was wondering if that cloubleed issue had to do with this. I had been asked to re-sign into my accounts all over the place for Google products and somehow didn't put two and two together. Gabriele Tomberli It has been confirmed by Google to not be related actually: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=1139#c25 Matt S. Huh wow, pretty curt response on closing the thread there. Wonder what the actual issue is? Arkitech Not really. He was right in stating it was completely wrong to ask there. More often than not folks who have that sort of knowledge level will be curt about most things. I work with a lot of them so maybe i'm just used to it?? ¬Ø_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø Matt S. Ha yeah, not the place and it was to the point, just sometimes feels a bit impersonal. TomCarchrae all the related security fallout could be considered to the point though, and that would be a lot! sadly, i doubt we'll ever see a transparent anything ever come out of google in terms of reacting to a breach. Pranjal Bhatia Happened to me a couple of days ago. I wasn't able to login and every time it showed "Server error try again" , on contacting google , they told me to change date & time manually and login again and it worked. They told me it was a sync error. This happened on another device of mine , i simply just logged back in and the issue hasn't returned. AdamH I have no issues. But few days ago Youtube was down for like 2 or 3 hours in the Czech rep. It might have something to do with this. Brian Flores Happened to me as well. My accounts also said "Brand Account" underneath them. It was the weirdest thing. Good to know I shouldn't be alarmed. Leo Ya, happened to me in Canada too. debsuvra I was just logged out of my secondary Google account on a third party mail app on Android. Primary email account works fine, both on phone and PC. Howard Stern ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà keep being asked to log in to my chrome browser at work and a tablet at home....i'm not getting this at home. nor on my phone. Dustin Gerlach I was unable to use my Google account on my phone for about 3 hours yesterday. exquisitemb I came home from work yesterday and worked for hours trying to figure out what was wrong with my Google WiFi spots.. Glad to see there was an actual cause for it.. Badouken This freaked me out so much last night. I went ahead and enabled a ton of security settings and was still receiving it. I was like what's going on?!?!? DirkBelig Happened on my Nexus 6P last night and thought it was some malware hack despite no w4r3z being loaded or even being rooted. Suspected phishing, but it seemed legit and reentered PW. Later it popped up on my Nexus 7 and my buddy's Pixel XL. Later, when word was finally getting around that there was some sort of glitch with El Goog, when I was logged out of my Nvidia SHIELD I wasn't worried. Robin I am from India and yesterday I face this issue, but only I face this issue in my family strange. PJ I do know my password and have entered it in all my devices only to have the pop up say my Google Account Has Been Changed and I need to enter my password which I had just done. It does not recognize my password. WTF? Hamilton Jimenez Vasquez That happened to me last night as well and was like "What?!!" Anyhow, after the shocking experience I though perhaps is time for me to change my password once and for all for all my web accounts, it's the same since two years ago. I know I've been doing this wrong in the wrong way because you are suppose to change it every 6 months, but Man, it is kind of bummer since I have to go through about 40 different webs sites, it is a process that takes a lot of time and effort in my case :( Ahnaf Mahmud Android Police you should probably check your site connection with cloudflare. Kim Having issues with it in Airmail on my iOS Travis Coble Had this happen yesterday on my 6P, and was seriously nervous I had been hacked. The best part? My two factor authentication made everything worse, as everytime a verification code was sent via text (NOT my preferred method FYI), Google Sign-In would spaz out and reset, so the process was repeated three to five times. A quick reset seemed to fix the issue, and I have been using my account with no apparent issues. imsoupercereal Glad I saw this. I did a lot of digging last night to make sure my account wasn't compromised. Ming William Lee I had it last night, really scared, especially AP did not post anything on it at the time... -Matoro Zeliph- I THOUGHT I WAS HACKED yesterday! This isn't funny Google! Maybe they did this on purpose so that we can change our passwords to be stronger. No longer I will use my pets name as a Google password Cakefish Looks like I am in the tiny minority who wasn't affected at all. Weird. Rob Same here Maria Hernandez I had this happen to me and thought someone tried to hack my account. I have that 2 step verification turned on so I wasn't too worried. Demonshout Thought I was hacked lastnight, changed my password and everything. saf1927 Had this issue yesterday, but I simply had to enter the password and the 2FA code to get back to business. Hurricane Andrew This happened to be yesterday as well. I was concerned, and went to my security settings to check for any new device sign-ins or security events, and there were none, so I felt a little better but have still been uneasy. This article clears up my remaining concerns and puts me at ease. Thanks for the coverage, Phil! SB This happened when I tried to watch a movie on our LG Smart TV. When tried to rent a movie I had to enter in the code that was shown on the tv as verification. SpasilliumNexus Welp I'm temporarily locked out of my phone. I've got hit with this on my 3T and changed my password. At the same time I was backing stuff up to do a factory reset. After I did the reset, when I try to sign in on the phone it says I have to wait 24 hours. Jen Unfortunately, this is different from and unrelated to the weird issue that's been plaguing many Google Home users for over a week and is therefore causing our problem to get less attention (because support thinks we're talking about this account linking/sign in thing). For some reason, after a random (small) number of home automation commands, the GH just stops responding with anything other than "something went wrong, try again in a few seconds" until the device is rebooted from the 3 dot menu in the app. Then all is fine again until a few more home automation commands are issued. While there is now a pinned thread about this in the product forums (https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/googlehome/tOFxNFN_exg), it doesn't look like any significant progress has been made on even officially acknowledging the issue and its status. thespacecowboy It weirdly only happened on one of my google accounts, and not both of them. I trusted it as it was a proper google notification rather than an email. I HOPE those can't be spoofed... Juniors234 Just got signed out for no reason from my Google Account 5 mins ago. -__- HSidhu Change your password, big data leak at Google. Hamdi Ferchichi On Windows 10 too! Ail√≠n √ì‚ÄôS I had this happen in Ireland on my Nexus 9 and OnePlus 3. Scared me to no end! Pedro Diego Fern√°ndez I was freaking out about this yesterday and found nothing online, only 2 or 3 post from 3 years ago, without any clear explanation... now I have 2steps verification and my tinfoil hat on just in case HSidhu Big G is not safe anymore, moving my photos from Google Photos. Vivek Rameses It hasn't been for years. Probably around the time they dropped the do no evil motto. wjrandon In addition to my Android devices. My Google account has been disconnected from Chrome on various computers and applications that depend on Google Sign-in have lost their account authorization. gosa Had this one last night (CET) Googled the issue, but I either didn't search properly or I was too early. Went through two "better safe than sorry" password resets because of the lack of information found. But at least I learned about two factor verification in the process... Robert Nicewander Keep an eye on things, I had to sign in on my phone yesterday and today I've gotten two phishing E-mails. May be unrelated, but I rarely get these kind of E-mails and I don't believe in coincidence... SIGTRAP Got that notification on my phone last night. I bet the intern over at Google tripped over an ethernet cable. Martial Clausse Happened to me too... Removed my account, deleted cache & data from Google play services. Readded my account. Everything works now. Andrew Brereton For me it's only the new Google Voice app. Every time it opens I have to sign in, and when it's backgrounded I don't get any notifications. Very frustrating. Everything else works though. Socaltyger Still can't log into my YouTube account on my Nvidia shield. Keeps getting the same error message. Lee Anne L Happened to me yesterday and I'm in Ontario Canada =( Ignacio Nallar My Google Now (I believe now it's Feed, can't keep up) won't load since yesterday. Might be related? TedPhillips i had assumed this was because of the sha1 break, they want people to sign in again to rehash tokens... that said, my account got dinged several time a couple of weeks ago, heard about this though last night from the 'rents (thought they had been hacked) Paul Yep happened to me on my tablet, phone and desktop chrome browser but once I signed back in on all of them, it worked without any issues. Was strange because I was in the Google Play Store at the time and it just happened out of the blue, anyway, glad it's not a security issue. ekngee yup, happened to me as well. woke up with a notification telling me to sign in because "something was changed". and my 2FA got reverted to SMS, not Google Prompt. when i went in to check my security settings, Google Prompt could not find my phone. >:( had to remove and add back my account to get things working again. keithzg I had this yesterday, but by today my phone is back and listed without me having to do anything. (Note: I live in Edmonton, Alberta.) ashjas This is due to yesterday's cloudbleed data leek bug of cloudfare in my guess,that google is being silent of. Vivek Rameses Same here on my device. My apps in play store says authorization required. But I could care less. Not doing any harm. dsignrr I had an issue with my Motorola tablet the week before last, when after some updates all my google apps ceased to function. Gmail and Maps would open and immediately close again, while Drive and Photos would open to show only some of my files and pics. Google sign in was posting error messages saying there was no wifi even though the tablet showed strong signal and other apps, including Play Store were functional. I tried everything, even did a factory reset on the device, and after 2 days of wasting time, I bought a new tablet and erased everything again on the Motorola. All my other devices, phones, other tablet, and laptop, had no issues with accessing my Google account. I can only assume that some update affected that particular unit. It is running Android 4.1 and I "did" disable Play Services and uninstall the updates followed by fresh updating to no avail. Michael During this period my Hangouts send a few blank messages to someone on my friends list. I do have 2 factor auth enabled. mazamorac Speculation: Google forced everyone's sessions to log out to protect them against Cloudbleed session token caching. I for one am grateful that I've had to reauthenticate. I also changed my application-specific passwords, make sure you do so if you're using 2FA. Darnell Good to see Google has made an announcement. Google still beats the heck out of a Yahoo account :-D . Hex I still cant get any help from Google. They are not sending the code to my phone still. How to fix this? When I use my email, they send the code, but then it links to 3 different accounts Ive never seen before. Also when I ask for them to find my account, put in my phone number and name it says there is no account. Can anyone help? Is there a way to contact google by phone? Wallace Finch My phone can log into Google just fine with the browser but the Gmail refuses to sync. I can't authenticate the account, it keeps saying the password is wrong (it isn't). I've disconnected the account from my phone and then re-connected, but it still won't log in. Courtney&Cyrus Staley Still locked out two weeks later because the two step codes aren't being sent right either. They say they're aware of the issue and working on it. Doesn't help. Alisa MotoAdventureGal This sign out issue happens to me several times a day. The result is that I do not get incoming text messages because I have been inadvertently signed out of my Google account. The frustrating thing is that I only get signed out of Google Voice, not email or Google Drive. What's worse, is that I was just in Cuba. I inadvertently got signed out of my account due to their system errors, and then when I tried to sign back in I was told that this service is not supported in this country. So I had zero access to my Google account. Very frustrating! halfbloodnative I need help info got a new phone and it's saying that their has been a recent password change try back in 24 hours is this the case after 24 hours will it let me log in the Google account I have two other devices and they are working fine was told that it's a security feature and nothing I can do for 24 hours please is this true I'm going nuts trying to fix this and I'm not touching my phone untill 24 hours is up and I was told if I try any sooner then that it will reset the clock is this true Follow Android Police 1.49M 467k 142k 113k Latest Deals 0 [Deal Alert] Costco offering cash cards, charging kits, and more for Galaxy S8/S8+ activations 2017/05/05 6:53pm PDTMay 5, 2017 3 [Deal Alert] Fossil smartwatches discounted 25% everywhere 2017/05/05 11:36am PDTMay 5, 2017 15 [Deal Alert] Finish off the week with 44 temporarily free and 12 on-sale apps 2017/05/05 9:06am PDTMay 5, 2017 17 [Update: Groupon] Deal Alert: Bragi's truly wireless earbuds, The Dash, are $100 on Woot for a refurbished pair ($200 off) 2017/05/05 1:10am PDTMay 5, 2017 15 [Deal Alert] Unlocked Sony Xperia XZs down to $620 at Amazon ($64 off) 2017/05/04 7:35pm PDTMay 4, 2017 Latest Poll Do you use a screen protector on your phone?

Details Published: 2017-05-05 11:39:41 Updated: 2017-05-05 11:39:41 Comments Increase Text Size Print this story Business How Burger King revealed the hackability of voice assistants Posted 11:39 a.m. yesterday Leave this field blank Your e-mail address:* Your friends e-mail addresses (comma separated):* Subject:* Message:*A friend wanted you to see this item from WRAL.com: http://wr.al/180Ne Get a new codeAre you human?* You must enter the characters with black color that stand out from the other characters By MAE ANDERSON, AP Technology Writer NEW YORK ‚Äî Burger King pulled a pretty juicy marketing stunt last month that drew plenty of attention ‚Äî not just to the Whopper, but also to the intrinsic vulnerabilities of a new type of voice-activated gadget. The fast food chain's 15-second television ad targeted Google Home, a speaker that can answer questions and control other smart appliances. When an actor in the ad said "OK, Google" and asked a question about the Whopper, Google Home obediently began reading the burger's ingredients in homes around the country ‚Äî effectively extending the commercial for however long it took someone to shout "OK, Google, stop!" Google and Wikipedia quickly made fixes to shut it down. Though annoying, the stunt may have done some good by highlighting how easy it is to hijack such devices. (Just imagine a burglar spying a voice assistant and asking it to unlock all the doors.) It could also speed the development of home voice assistants with better security. "It's a wakeup call," said Earl Perkins, a digital security analyst at the research firm Gartner. "It's a harbinger of things to come." TRIGGER WARNING Voice assistants such as Google Home, Apple's Siri and Amazon's Echo devices have always been susceptible to accidental hijack. A Google ad during the Super Bowl that used the phrase "OK, Google" reportedly set off people's devices. And in a January story that briefly turned a family into media celebrities, a woman's 6-year old daughter ordered a dollhouse and sugar cookies simply by asking Amazon's voice assistant Alexa for them. Since the devices are so new ‚Äî the Amazon Echo debuted in 2015, Google Home last year ‚Äî they're still having growing pains. And they're growing in popularity; Consumer Intelligence Research Partners estimates that Amazon sold 3 million Echo devices in the U.S. in the fourth quarter of 2016, bringing the total to more than 8 million. Amazon doesn't release sales figures. Many experts believe that deliberate attempts to trigger voice assistants will be short-lived. Among other things, brands have to face the consequences of potentially annoying millions of people. "Burger King was doing what the Burger King brand is known to do, stir controversy and make sure it gets lots of coverage," Forrester principal analyst James McQuivey said. "Very few brands want to do that." Of course, spammers and other bottom-feeding marketers can still try to implement the technique. But voice assistants already have a few ways to block them. THREATS AND COUNTERMEASURES Amazon already makes sure its TV commercials and those of its partners can't inadvertently trigger the speaker. Developers that provide Echo with "skills" that let it, for instance, order pizza, are also prohibited from creating Alexa commands that would trigger ads. Google says it also has techniques to block TV ads from activating Google Home. Neither company provided details on those techniques. Voice assistants are still in their "very early days," Google says; the company plans to "monitor and learn as we go." Hackers might also be a threat. But because voice assistants are so new and limited in scope, more established connected devices such as webcams, routers and printers pose more of a threat for now. "It's not that we won't see some creative or unique instance (of hacking), but I don't think this is going to be the next great wave of cybercrime," said Steve Grobman, chief technology officer at the security company McAfee. MORE SECURITY TO COME But before long, the devices are going to need better security. "When you move into a world of voice, some of the rules that we're accustomed to, related to security for computers, change," Gartner's Perkins said. Exactly how that works could depend on exactly what task a voice assistant is performing. Asking about the weather requires less security than say, shopping or accessing a bank account. Amazon already has options for setting up security codes to shop, make financial transactions or unlock and start cars. Of course, someone could always overhear you reciting a security phrase. A better solution, and one that companies are hard at work on, would be to identify a person's voice, much the way Google and Facebook identify faces today. Beyond improving security, that technology could help the device personalize recommendations or even ads for the individual, not the whole family. Apple already lets users voice-train its Siri digital assistant so it's more likely to activate only when it hears a specific voice. Amazon has a voice training option for Alexa. Google Home can recognize up to six different voices, though it won't prevent unauthorized users from activating the assistant. Experts suggest that companies will eventually add cameras to voice assistants. Amazon's new Echo Look has a camera, but it's for offering fashion advice. Combining a facial scan with voice recognition would definitely beef up security, although they'll also create new privacy concerns. "Without any security or minimal security, (voice assistants are) going to be a fat target," Perkins said. "There will be all kinds of innovation associated with compromising these systems."

Cybercriminals sent emails that appeared to come from Google and that claimed that someone wanted to share a Google Docs document with the recipient. Large numbers of users received the malicious invitation. When users clicked the link in the mail they were directed to a real login screen of Google. On this screen they were asked whether the web app ‚ÄòGoogle Docs‚Äô should be allowed to access their Google account. If the user gave permission, the criminals gained access to the user‚Äôs contacts and all these contacts then also received the phishing mail. Google quickly took measures, the malcious web app was removed together with the accounts from which the attack was started. The search giant claims to have stopped the attack in about an hour and that less than 0.1 of the Gmail users received the phishing mail. The cybercriminals also didn‚Äôt get any other data than the contact information used to sent the phishing mails.

The AIY Projects¬†voice kit includes a speaker, microphone, cables, arcade-style button, and a cardboard case that you can fold to put everything together in a small box. When it‚Äôs done you can trigger Google Assistant by pressing the button, clapping your hands, or using a different trigger. One of the coolest things about the hardware kit? You can get it for free‚Ä¶ when you buy issue 57 of MagPi, a magazine about the Raspberry Pi. You can actually download a PDF of the magazine for free, but clearly the digital edition doesn‚Äôt come with the hardware needed to bring Google Assistant-compatible hardware to a Raspberry Pi 3. That said, you don‚Äôt need this specific kit to do that. Google specifically called out the Raspberry Pi 3 as one of the devices compatible with the new Google Assistant SDK, which means that you can connect just about any mic and speaker to start working with the software development kit. via Raspberry Pi Share this: Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Email Leave a Reply 4 Comments on "Hardware kit turns Raspberry Pi into a DIY Google Home (kind of)" Login with Notify of new follow-up comments new replies to my comments Notify of new replies to this comment Notify of new replies to this comment Sort by: ¬† newest | oldest | most voted Guest Jose Ernesto Laguarda Rodriguez Share On TwitterShare On Google Click to flag and open ¬´Comment Reporting¬ª form.

KitGuru The KitGuru System Home News Reviews Gaming Lifestyle Mobile Professional Forum Home / Channel / General Tech / Music streaming services call for European Commission to end ‚Äòapp store abuse‚Äô Music streaming services call for European Commission to end ‚Äòapp store abuse‚Äô Matthew Wilson 14 hours ago General Tech It looks like rival music streaming services are getting sick of Apple and Google‚Äôs app store dominance, causing the likes of Deezer and Spotify to send in their complaints to the European Commission. The letter accuses Apple and Google of abusing their position as the largest app store holders, asking that an anti-competition investigation gets underway. According to a report from the Financial Times, a letter signed by the CEOs of Spotify, Deezer and several other companies has gone off to the European Commission, citing ‚Äútroubling‚Äù app store practises from Apple and Google. The letter goes on to say that app stores have gone from being gateways into gatekeepers, implying that these app stores don‚Äôt do enough to highlight rival services. The EU has launched several investigations into both Apple and Google in the past, now with companies banding together with letters like this, there may be another one. One of the other key points in the letter is that when a customer signs up through an app store, these companies don‚Äôt get to see that data, though this is likely down to strong privacy policies. KitGuru Says: We don‚Äôt know if the European Commission will launch a new investigation into app stores at this point. However, the EC hasn‚Äôt exactly been shy about launching antitrust investigations over the last few years, so I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised to see a new one spring into action after this.

The company said it is working to prevent these cases, including adding new technology, letting brands control where ads run and using third-party companies to monitor content. Michelle Castillo | @mishcastillo 14 Hours AgoCNBC.com SHARES Michael Newberg | CNBC Susan Wojcicki, CEO of YouTube. YouTube lost 5 percent of its U.S. and Canadian top ad clients during the month of April after reports that some ads were running next to inappropriate content, according to ad analytics platform MediaRadar. The April dip followed a report in late March which showed that ads for companies including Mercedes-Benz and Waitrose were running next to neo-Nazi and jihadist content on YouTube and on websites whose advertising was placed by Google-owned platforms. Following that revelation advertising agency Havas pulled its U.K. clients, and several brands including L'Oreal, McDonald's, Audi, Starbucks, Pepsi, Dish Network and General Motors said they were pulling advertising from YouTube, with some removing more or all ads on other Google platforms. (The number of advertisers on YouTube increased the first three months of the year, according to MediaRadar.) MediaRadar ‚Äî which works with more than 1,600 publishers including The New York Times, BuzzFeed, and Bloomberg ‚Äî uses artificial intelligence to track advertising and sells that data to companies. The 5 percent were customers of Google Preferred, YouTube's program for advertising on its top-tier videos. It is bought in an "upfront" style, meaning companies commit advertising money before programming runs. But that doesn't mean they can't back out. "Securing ad space in advance is not a promise to run ads no matter what," MediaRadar CEO Todd Krizelman said. "Advertisers and their agencies can immediately cancel or put campaigns on hold if they are worried about brand safety." Five percent is not insignificant, but it would require more defections for the company to really feel the impact. Mizuho said if 10 percent of brands pulled their ads, it would decrease the company's earns per share by $0.15 cents this year or a little under 1 percent of the value. (Google's most recent earnings report, on April 27, would not reflect April's decline in advertising since it covered the first quarter of 2017.) Google did not respond to a request for comment. YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki said on Thursday during Brandcast, Google's annual presentation of upcoming content for advertisers, it was working on fixing the ad adjacency issue with more technology, giving brands more control over where their ads run and bringing in third-party companies like comScore and Integral Ad Science to monitor content. Brands that pulled advertising seem to be coming back as well. YouTube said at the event that Johnson & Johnson ‚Äî which initially pulled ads after the adjacency problems ‚Äî would sponsor an upcoming talent competition series produced by Ryan Seacrest. "We apologize for letting some of you down," Wojcicki said. "I'm here to say that we can and we will do better." Note: CNBC parent company NBCUniversal is an investor in BuzzFeed.

[Is This Real?] Google Calendar's web interface should be getting a redesign in Q4 2017 Rita El Khoury Follow View All Posts 2017/05/04 5:33am PDTMay 4, 2017 61 Plus 1 on G+ 92 Share on Facebook 59 Share on Twitter Total Shares212 Google News Videos Folks, it's happening. Alright, it's not happening right now, but it should be happening soon. What every Google Calendar user has wanted for years, what every Google user who dared venture in the dark and murky waters of calendar.google.com has clamored for, what every piece of common sense has predicted: Google Calendar's web interface is getting a revamp. According to this roadmap of G Suite features that has appeared in a presentation from Google's Cloud NEXT 2017 event, Google Calendar has a "redesign of web interface" planned for Q4 2017. If that is what it exactly says it should be, then we will finally have that brand spanking new Calendar UI on the web that we've been dreaming of and that we can only achieve with themes and extensions right now. Below, you will find the entire slide of G Suite's usability features roadmap ‚Äî check it out to see if there's something else planned that is interesting. I've also linked to the exact moment it shows up in the video of the "G Suite Product Roadmap ‚Äî 2017 and beyond" presentation. (The video is from the EMEA satellite event with Dennis DeMeyere presenting, but it should be the same presentation as the one in San Francisco.) Nothing in here says "Material Design" or "new and shiny and colorful and clean and modern," so we can't jump to conclusions just yet. But at least we have hope that at some point in Q4 2017, Google Calendar on the web will look less like the lost bastard child of a 2013 one-night stand.

Yes, please! F4LL0U7 More reminder functionality, and let me guess, it won't integrate with Google Now, Keep, Calendar, or Inbox reminders? Maybe they'll introduce a new Gmail Messenger while they're at it... F4LL0U7 (I do realize this is most likely adding the ability to create reminders for certain emails that you don't want to fall off your radar, which I fully support!) catalysto This is exactly what Inbox is designed for. F4LL0U7 Right, but some of us just can't get into the Inbox interface, and would still like reminders on our emails. Cesar Cardoso "Gmail - create reminders. Yes, please!" And PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE integrate with all the 70000 reminders on Google products. Even if it's more like "star on steriods", as F4LL0U7 speculates. The Swami i'd settle for something simple, like an actual usable recurring Tasks setup, instead of having to go out for other apps to integrate that functionality into Google Calendar (reminders are worthless to me for this). Unfortunately, Google puts in what Google wants, not what the customer wants. Geoff Johnson Since they love splitting one service into many, I wouldn't be surprised to see features stripped from Calendar and put into a separate app. Mark Curtis Another chat app. Midas Gordon-Farleigh With a bot that you can talk to to create an event. Leo Herzog Did you watch the video? That's literally a feature of their new Hangouts Chat product. Midas Gordon-Farleigh No, I didn't. Unfortunately, not being a GSuite user, I figured there probably wasn't much worth my time in that. That's a bit silly though. Sigh. Defenestratus I don't use calendar for work - but for my personal life it seems to work pretty well. Not sure what it is that people want out of a redesign. Sean Thomas that's the same for me but I only use the android app which is material already. if you go to the calendar website on desktop it's just kind of outdated compared to the app interface. Defenestratus Yeah I guess I can see that. I don't think the design ever really got in the way of my using the product though. The "Create Event" screen on the other hand... it needs some help. Suicide_Note My thoughts exactly. Dawid Kania Hi Rita! I can confirm that this redesign exists. What's even more interesting since yesterday I have access to it. (I'm a member of "New Google Calendar Web Trusted Tester Program" at my current company). We are a G Suite customer and have received invitations to join the trusted testers program on 26th of April. Nicholas Conrad Oops, just violated the trusted tester tos :/ Dawid Kania Hi Nicholas, Thanks for pointing that out. Not being aware of the tos doesn't mean I should assume there is none. My bad. Dan Well now I want to know what was said... Josh Flowers He said https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/72eaa756ce425ac019d0637e35838dcd5846e8e660c771d22950b13701f6eee4.jpg Nicholas Conrad I don't want a candy-coated calendar. Material design really does nothing for me, reminds me of: https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/68423836fc3bc7576ed6e12686edeaa2f4b35db5c9c05a508d014f98b01e0b32.jpg Marcellus1 Disappointed the roadmap doesn't include more on Docs. It didn't have enough features I need to switch from Word. Leo Herzog The only thing left for me is custom fonts. What else are you missing? Kevfromspace A Show ruler setting would be great Marcellus1 I need a lot more formatting options. Trevor Kinsie I really hope that the redesign changes nothing about the functionality. I love Google Calendars as it is, I know it's not the purdiest thing, but that really doesn't matter to me. Please google just give it a nice coat of paint and be done, if you can add features great! Just don't take anything away. Rita El Khoury I love most of Calendar as it is, but for goodness sake, make it easier to set up notifications when someone adds an event to a shared calendar. Right now, users have to manually (and in a not-so-clear way or place) turn on email notifications for shared calendar changes, and that's it. Emails... In 2017. Miles‚àôPrower I know folks who love Google Calendar for what it is. Me? I'm old enough to have spent years on Palm, then on Pocket PC and Windows Mobile -- with integrations to Office desktop. When I switched over to Android and Google Apps almost a decade ago, I was surprised at the utter shittiness of the user experience in Google's productivity tools. Since then, Android's versions of these tools has improved immensely, while Google's web-based tools have remained as shitty as day 1. And Calendar is by far the worst of them. Come on, it's 2017, and you still have to navigate to a whole new web page that displays an entry form, just to see the details/notes for an appointment? Alex I'd like to see improved support for the quick entry feature on the web. In the app, it will autocomplete locations after you type "at", assigning the full address to the location field of the event. This doesn't happen on the web, at the moment. I usually end up going in to the app to manually set the location, as it works better. mondeca Congrats on finally doing things that needed doing a long time ago? James Donut Anyone uses here gmail as a journal (past dates) rather than scheduler (future)??? Daniel It's about time! The web app looks like a website from a decade ago... 4Ui812 This one's for you Rita üòÅ https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/6e83fc9381904fe522d202244f0a29e30b87f3a4fe62d22351427aaaa3618cf6.jpg jwildman16 I've driven by there many times! Indian Hills, CO. bazsi44 A little bit of self ad maybe, but I waited too long for this, so I made a Material Redesign myself. :) You will need Stylish and Tampermonkey/Greasemonkey to use it though. http://balazsorban.com/google-calendar-web-material/ https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/ad239a2458b5009c1fa2637ba8d59dc2142593b759733b221e384075cf2fbd8e.png It may have some flows, as I updated it a long time ago. But It is still nicer than that we have now. aRvInD While design overhaul is needed, Mobile Calendar app while I daily use Only sync events/reminders only for past year! Why Google? We are using smartphone with GBs of storage these days. Giving the user with option to sync how history events need to be synced should be made..! Even now when storage is full to remaining 0%, it shows no space to save a small single SMS! Can't SMS memory reserve an MB space prior? Gonzales You'd think that Google loving the cloud there'd be plenty of room. I'm hoping this design carries over to the mobile app. I use that daily. Carson Saldanha Ink for Google's pretty good Anjo Cerde√±a üëÜ This, but I'm very biased. Diggle Link please? Carson Saldanha Just search for it in the Chrome Web Store Carson Saldanha It's an extension Ger PG Not really thrilled about this considering how the Contacts interface was "improved" some time ago... Winston Oh goody another way to add reminders is coming. Winston This will give me even more choices when adding a reminder, and cover so many use cases. Not confusing at all! /s EcE OMG!!!!!! https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/19c21de580767556b5152df546358399957f9b59b55dafd30cff4d3a2553ab38.gif Nope.jpeg This might have to do for now. https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/clean-google-calendar/magodclodecbbnbdfpmoehfdddkhlfmm Diego S. It seems to be the end of the world!! I use Ink for Google Services Chrome Extension Butterpillar They better add flairs like in mobile apps, otherwise I won't use it. Rita El Khoury Meta: What would happen if during the revamp, calendar.google.com went down and Google forgot it had scheduled a Calendar revamp on its own calendar? wicketr What if their "revamp" is to replace it like Allo replaced Hangouts missing tons of features for an entire year. Like it requires a new account type, and doesn't integrate with your existing gmail account /friends, and missing ability to create events, and lacks any synchronization to the cloud and your mobile device since all data is stored in a cookie on that specific PC. Rita El Khoury Funny, but if we're being serious, Google might mess with a lot of things, but Calendar isn't one of them. Part of the reason they haven't updated the UI until now, I think. JG But don't worry... At least we'll be able to add stickers and animated emoji to our calendar events... That's far more important than silly things like being able to access it from something other than just a single device. Berni Hargrove So the real story here is why doesn't Google publicly release product roadmaps for their other products. Mathew Michel Please Google, upgrade the design this time. It's been too long. HSidhu Reminders are coming to Gmail, now I know which one to choose from (Inbox or Gmail) :) Tks Rita mike shwilly Q4 2018 - Calendar redesign moves from G-Suite to public Cesar Cardoso "Calendar - discoverability of secondary calendars" About time, Google, about time! Urmil Shroff I cannot even believe. Hamilton Jimenez Vasquez Then please they should add more options for Repeat, like "Every last Friday of the Month" or "Every First Monday of the Month". PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE. Gary Oberbrunner First Monday works fine already. Don't think Last does though. sky417 Still no love for Google Finance? Leo Herzog What, you don't like Flash charts? Curt inb4 bricks all Nexus and Pixel devices when accessed via one of them. Patch 6 weeks later. Jimmy Roche The animal sacrifices have paid off, long live gcal Jordan L great, I can't wait to see what useful features they remove in order to make it look more modern. BlackHawkRider .

In January 2017, a woman's 6-year old daughter ordered a dollhouse and sugar cookies simply by asking Alexa for them through an Echo Dot. Since these devices are still new, they're still having growing pains. But the next generation of voice assistants may come with better security, including individual voice recognition and even image recognition. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File) NEW YORK ‚Äî Burger King pulled a pretty juicy marketing stunt last month that drew plenty of attention ‚Äî not just to the Whopper, but also to the intrinsic vulnerabilities of a new type of voice-activated gadget. The fast food chain's 15-second television ad targeted Google Home, a speaker that can answer questions and control other smart appliances. When an actor in the ad said "OK, Google" and asked a question about the Whopper, Google Home obediently began reading the burger's ingredients in homes around the country ‚Äî effectively extending the commercial for however long it took someone to shout "OK, Google, stop!" Google and Wikipedia quickly made fixes to shut it down. Though annoying, the stunt may have done some good by highlighting how easy it is to hijack such devices. (Just imagine a burglar spying a voice assistant and asking it to unlock all the doors.) It could also speed the development of home voice assistants with better security. "It's a wakeup call," said Earl Perkins, a digital security analyst at the research firm Gartner. "It's a harbinger of things to come." TRIGGER WARNING Voice assistants such as Google Home, Apple's Siri and Amazon's Echo devices have always been susceptible to accidental hijack. A Google ad during the Super Bowl that used the phrase "OK, Google" reportedly set off people's devices. And in a January story that briefly turned a family into media celebrities, a woman's 6-year old daughter ordered a dollhouse and sugar cookies simply by asking Amazon's voice assistant Alexa for them. Since the devices are so new ‚Äî the Amazon Echo debuted in 2015, Google Home last year ‚Äî they're still having growing pains. And they're growing in popularity; Consumer Intelligence Research Partners estimates that Amazon sold 3 million Echo devices in the U.S. in the fourth quarter of 2016, bringing the total to more than 8 million. Amazon doesn't release sales figures. Many experts believe that deliberate attempts to trigger voice assistants will be short-lived. Among other things, brands have to face the consequences of potentially annoying millions of people. "Burger King was doing what the Burger King brand is known to do, stir controversy and make sure it gets lots of coverage," Forrester principal analyst James McQuivey said. "Very few brands want to do that." Of course, spammers and other bottom-feeding marketers can still try to implement the technique. But voice assistants already have a few ways to block them. THREATS AND COUNTERMEASURES Amazon already makes sure its TV commercials and those of its partners can't inadvertently trigger the speaker. Developers that provide Echo with "skills" that let it, for instance, order pizza, are also prohibited from creating Alexa commands that would trigger ads. Google says it also has techniques to block TV ads from activating Google Home. Neither company provided details on those techniques. Voice assistants are still in their "very early days," Google says; the company plans to "monitor and learn as we go." Hackers might also be a threat. But because voice assistants are so new and limited in scope, more established connected devices such as webcams, routers and printers pose more of a threat for now. "It's not that we won't see some creative or unique instance (of hacking), but I don't think this is going to be the next great wave of cybercrime," said Steve Grobman, chief technology officer at the security company McAfee. MORE SECURITY TO COME But before long, the devices are going to need better security. "When you move into a world of voice, some of the rules that we're accustomed to, related to security for computers, change," Gartner's Perkins said. Exactly how that works could depend on exactly what task a voice assistant is performing. Asking about the weather requires less security than say, shopping or accessing a bank account. Amazon already has options for setting up security codes to shop, make financial transactions or unlock and start cars. Of course, someone could always overhear you reciting a security phrase. A better solution, and one that companies are hard at work on, would be to identify a person's voice, much the way Google and Facebook identify faces today. Beyond improving security, that technology could help the device personalize recommendations or even ads for the individual, not the whole family. Apple already lets users voice-train its Siri digital assistant so it's more likely to activate only when it hears a specific voice. Amazon has a voice training option for Alexa. Google Home can recognize up to six different voices, though it won't prevent unauthorized users from activating the assistant. Experts suggest that companies will eventually add cameras to voice assistants. Amazon's new Echo Look has a camera, but it's for offering fashion advice. Combining a facial scan with voice recognition would definitely beef up security, although they'll also create new privacy concerns. "Without any security or minimal security, (voice assistants are) going to be a fat target," Perkins said. "There will be all kinds of innovation associated with compromising these systems." ¬† ¬† ¬† E-mail this Article Print this Article Share this Article ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† Story Tools ¬† E-mail this Article Print this Article Share this Article ¬† Font: * * * * * ¬† Image: * * * * ¬† ¬† ¬† FILE - In this March 2, 2016, file photo, David Limp, Amazon Senior Vice President of Devices, pushes down on an Echo Dot in San Francisco.

Android Waze vs. Google Maps: Which App Is Best for You? Joel Lee May 5, 2017 05-05-2017 5 minutes Waze vs. Google Maps: Which App Is Best for You? Facebook Twitter Pinterest Stumbleupon Whatsapp Email When Google acquired Waze back in 2013, a lot of users thought it meant lights out for the Israel-based mapping service. But that hasn‚Äôt been the case. Instead of being entirely folded in, Waze continues to exist alongside Google Maps. And that‚Äôs great in terms of user preference and choice, but it leaves us with a tough question: Which navigation app is the best? On the one hand, the two apps share a lot of the same behind-the-scenes mapping data How Does Google Maps Work? How Does Google Maps Work? Google Maps is used by millions of people every day and you might be one of them, but how does it actually work and how does Google maintain its accuracy so well? Read More , so they‚Äôre both more than adequate for the job. That being said, they do serve different audiences, and the one that you prefer will come down to what kind of navigation experience you‚Äôre looking for. Navigation and Interface Of all the navigation apps currently available, Google Maps is the cleanest and most professional Google Maps on Android: Everything You Need to Know Google Maps on Android: Everything You Need to Know Does Google Maps on your Android device feel a bit daunting? We've got you covered. Here's everything you need to know about using Google Maps on Android. Read More . The interface is minimal, routes are easy to set up and navigate, and it‚Äôs quite intuitive to use. Because of this, I find it excellent for traveling to new and unknown destinations ‚Äî no distractions. This tight focus has a secondary benefit: Google Maps tends to perform better on older devices. I still experience some lag and choppiness on my weak Moto E and Galaxy S3 Mini, but it‚Äôs nowhere near as bad as what I‚Äôve experienced on other apps. And for city-dwellers, Google Maps is awesome because it provides routes and estimates for walking, biking, and public transportation. Waze is a love-it-or-hate-it kind of app. Whereas Google Maps is all about being bland and serviceable for all people, Waze comes with a lot of personality and quirkiness. It‚Äôs more ‚Äúfun‚Äù with unnecessary features, but that comes with a price: readability and performance. When using Waze, you can input what kind of vehicle you‚Äôre driving (e.g. Private or Taxi), your preferred gas type (e.g. Regular, Midgrade, Premium, Diesel), and whether you want to avoid toll roads. The gas type will come into play later (see ‚ÄúConvenience and Special Features‚Äù below). Waze is also a driving-only app ‚Äî no estimates for walking, biking, or public transportation like Google Maps. Routes, Alerts, and Updates One of Waze‚Äôs biggest selling points is its real-time traffic reports and routing updates. Users, like you and me, can submit live reports of accidents, construction zones, hazards such as potholes, etc. And based on these reports, Waze will automatically update your route to avoid them. Yes, Google Maps also does something similar, but Waze is a lot more aggressive. Whereas Google Maps will try to take the fastest path using main roads, Waze won‚Äôt hesitate to take you through back routes. As such, driving with Waze can be a bit hectic, but it often saves more time than Google Maps. Waze updates also tend to be ‚Äúmore real-time‚Äù than Google because Waze uses crowdsourced submissions while Google automates based on data transmitted from active Google Maps users, and there can be a delay while Google crunches data to arrive at conclusions. Google Maps doesn‚Äôt reroute often but does present alerts as traffic conditions change during transit. For example, when I was driving on a major highway the other day, I received a pop-up notification for an upcoming traffic jam. These notifications can be dismissed with a simple tap. For me, the only time Google Maps automatically reroutes is when I drive off of the current route. As soon as I do, Google Maps recalculates. One thing to note is that Google Maps does provide alternative routes as you drive. Most of the time, these routes are marked as ‚ÄúX minutes slower,‚Äù but if a faster route is found, you‚Äôll get a pop-up asking if you want to switch. A manual tap is needed to make the switch. Convenience and Special Features One feature I love about Google Maps is the ability to add one or more pit stops between your current location and your final destination. You can also plan trips ahead of time, either by setting a ‚ÄúDepart By‚Äù time or an ‚ÄúArrive At‚Äù time. These two features are great for complex, lengthy trips. Other nifty features include changing the view from top-down to 3D virtual buildings (useful for city navigation), navigating buildings with an indoor view (useful for shopping malls), and sending routes from PC to phone.

Read More . Waze offers a lot more than Google Maps, including its most controversial feature: avoiding police speed traps Police Officers Think Waze is Dangerous. Are They Right? Police Officers Think Waze is Dangerous. Are They Right? Waze can "be misused by those with criminal intent to endanger police officers and the community", claims a letter from a police chief to Google. Read More . Users can report the locations of police, prompting other Waze users in those areas to slow down. Users can also report the locations of speed cameras and red light cameras. Another useful feature is Planned Drives, which tells you when you need to depart in order to arrive at a destination by a certain time. It gets even better: Waze can sync with Calendar and Facebook events and automatically let you know when you need to leave. Other notable features include integration with Spotify (control music playback directly in Waze), speed alerts when driving too fast, recommendations for parking lots near your destination, and best-price gas stations along your route. That last one is a huge boon for longer trips! Local and Social Features If there‚Äôs one area where Waze absolutely excels beyond Google Maps, it‚Äôs socialization. Since most of Waze‚Äôs data is crowdsourced, it‚Äôs only natural that users feel like they‚Äôre working together ‚Äî but if you spot other Wazers on your map, you can beep them (sound alert) or send them messages (text). You can add friends, too. Doing so let‚Äôs you see each other‚Äôs locations and estimated arrival times when going to the same destination. Friends can be imported from Facebook or your contacts. Want some privacy? Use Invisible Mode to appear offline, although you can‚Äôt submit reports while invisible. Other social features include a Scoreboard (the more active you are, the more influence you have with reports) and Teams (tap into local stations to receive live updates and reports). The biggest difference between Google Maps and Waze is that Google Maps doesn‚Äôt have any of the social features. No chatting, no beeping, no friending, no scoreboards. It‚Äôs just you, Google, and the road ahead of you. However, Google does offer something that Waze doesn‚Äôt: excellent local business information. Google Maps search results are more accurate and more comprehensive. You get ratings, reviews, hours of operation, hours of activity, contact information, photos, ability to reserve a table, and more. The Bottom Line: What Do You Need? For daily commutes, use Waze. If you like social features, use Waze. If you trust user reports and want real-time updates, use Waze. If you‚Äôre going somewhere new or if you can‚Äôt handle Waze‚Äôs cluttered interface, use Google Maps. When researching local businesses, use Google Maps.

However, with Google Chrome, users can customize the entire look of Google and the homepage with themes. If you use Google Chrome but don‚Äôt want the plain white look it offers, and want to spruce things up a little bit, below we‚Äôll explain how to change the background image and entire look of Google Chrome. Read: Chrome for Mac Just Got a Lot Better Back in 2011 I had a beach theme look to Google and Gmail on my PC, which was a nice addition to their plain layout we‚Äôve been using for years, but most of that was killed off at one point. However, with Chrome themes you can make your entire web experience look completely different, and as you see fit. There‚Äôs a nice NYC theme (shown below) currently featured and free on the Chrome extension store as we speak. Read on to learn how easy it is to change the look of Chrome. Themes in Google Chrome allow you to get a piece of that customization back, and they even have some neat little tricks like the ability to remove the Google logo completely. Leaving only a search bar, and tons of other customization if you look hard enough for a theme that fits what you want. Instructions In Google Chrome start by heading to the top right of the page and selecting the three lines menu button, and then select Settings. Once in here you‚Äôll scroll down to themes, and hit Get themes. From here you‚Äôll be navigated to the Google Chrome webstore and its extensions area. In here are hundreds of thousands of themes. These are from Google themselves, developers, or you can even customize your own. You can add Get lucky search buttons, search for brands, promotional materials and more. I‚Äôve selected the NYC at Night theme shown at the top of the page, and it gives Google Chrome a nice look. Once you‚Äôve found the theme you‚Äôd like simply select Add to Chrome, and it will verify compatibility and install. You‚Äôll instantly notice the changes. Everything from movies, brands, games, sports and more can be applied for the look you‚Äôre after. That‚Äôs it and you‚Äôre all done. You‚Äôve now applied a custom theme that changed the entire look, depending on how much the theme includes, and changed the look of Google Chrome, the default page, and whatever else the theme is set to change. There‚Äôs an easy Undo button at the top if you don‚Äôt like it, or just continue on and enjoy your new look. You can easily head into the extensions setting on Chrome and delete or disable a theme, go back to default, or download and apply different themes. This is just one of many ways to keep things fresh and different on your Laptop, PC, and Google Chrome. There‚Äôs even a ‚ÄúGoogle Background Extension‚Äù add-on you can use to only change the Google Search background, vs an entire theme we‚Äôve shown above. Give them all a try, and enjoy. 11 Responses 07/20/2015 ian ludlow Reply This is all very well if you want to download one theme and install it. But if you‚Äôve downloaded more than one theme and would like to try them all out, periodically changing the theme, how do you do that ? 09/17/2015 Veena Reply Don‚Äôt help at all 02/08/2016 Satish Reply Its about theme they are telling about, but wanna add perticular image to chrome background. No meaning in the resolutions 02/16/2016 –ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–µ–π –õ–µ–≤–∏–Ω Reply I love this theme extention https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/backgrounds-every-day/oikopohbkicbnneinipgiihiijhephop 03/29/2016 rick Reply Didn`t work at all. Tried several times and only the very top of my home page displays some color. 04/21/2016 Joel Reply yes it did that to to me 06/02/2016 kelvin Reply go to http://www.themebeta.com/ to make your own chrome theme 06/09/2016 kayla Reply How do you switch themes when you already have some added? 07/07/2016 Connie Medeiros Reply Mine only shows at the top as well. How do I get my Google page to show the theme I‚Äôve chosen? 09/13/2016 Edward Herman Reply This only works when you open a new tab! so if you set your homepage to open to new tab your background will be there! it was the other way around but something happened ? 05/05/2017 John Reply Amazing its worked for newest version of my google chrome Thank you Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published.

If you'd like to learn more... - A A + Listen Family members of three victims of the December 2015 shooting rampage in San Bernardino, California, have sued Facebook, Google and Twitter, claiming that the companies permitted Islamic State to flourish on social media. The relatives assert that by allowing Islamic State militants to spread propaganda freely on social media, the three companies provided ‚Äúmaterial support‚Äù to the group and enabled attacks such as the one in San Bernardino. WATCH: Facebook promises action on violent video problem Story continues below ‚ÄúFor years defendants have knowingly and recklessly provided the terrorist group ISIS with accounts to use its social networks as a tool for spreading extremist propaganda, raising funds and attracting new recruits,‚Äù family members of Sierra Clayborn, Tin Nguyen and Nicholas Thalasinos charge in the 32-page complaint, which was filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles on Wednesday. ‚ÄúWithout defendants Twitter, Facebook and Google (YouTube), the explosive growth of ISIS over the last few years into the most feared terrorist group in the world would not have been possible,‚Äù the complaint said. WATCH: Police discuss note left behind by San Bernardino school shooter Spokeswomen for Twitter and Google declined to comment on the lawsuit. Representatives for Facebook could not immediately be reached by Reuters on Thursday afternoon. Syed Rizwan Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, opened fire on a holiday gathering of Farook‚Äôs co-workers at a government building in San Bernardino on Dec. 2, 2015, killing 14 people and wounding 22 others. Farook, the 28-year-old, U.S.-born son of Pakistani immigrants, and Malik, 29, a Pakistani native, died in a shootout with police four hours after the massacre. WATCH: Bill Gates weighs in on FBI vs Apple over San Bernardino shooter‚Äôs iPhone Authorities have said the couple was inspired by Islamist militants. At the time, the assault ranked as the deadliest attack by Islamist extremists on U.S. soil since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. In June 2016, an American-born gunman pledging allegiance to the leader of Islamic State shot 49 people to death at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida, before he was killed by police. In December 2016 the families of three men killed at the nightclub sued Twitter, Google and Facebook in federal court on allegations similar to those in the California lawsuit. Federal law gives internet companies broad immunity from liability for content posted by their users. A number of lawsuits have been filed in recent years seeking to hold social media companies responsible for terror attacks, but none has advanced beyond the preliminary phases. ¬©¬†2017¬†Thompson Reuters Report an error december 2015 San Bernardino Facebook Facebook Lawsuit Google ISIS Islamic State islamic State propaganda online San Bernardino San Bernardino Shooter Social Media Radicalism Twitter Editor's Picks Lifestyle The couples who found love on an app destined for casual hook-ups Canada Marijuana will be legal, but for many activists the fight isn't over Canada Why Canada wins, but many Torontonians lose, from Ontario's new housing measures Canada Inside Canada's flexible work economy.

Brought to you in partnership with MongoDB. Microsoft's Azure is what I consider the go-to for most C# developers looking to get their feet wet with cloud development, but it's not the end-all (some may think so) for cloud providers. In my last post, I mentioned the three big names of cloud providers: Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services, and the Google Cloud Platform. Do the other two offer some .NET goodness to compete with Azure? In this post, I provide a quick brief on Amazon and Google's offerings to the .NET community. Amazon Web Services I know Azure has been around for a while, but lately, when you mention web services, the one company that comes to mind is Amazon Web Services. Not only do they have a way to create a .NET website, they even have a¬†Visual Studio Extension for AWS. I'm wondering if a newer version will arrive since Visual Studio 2017 was just released. Once you get the Visual Studio extension installed, you can start with the Amazon Web Services .NET Quickstart. Their version of Microsoft's App Services (websites) is Elastic Beanstalk. Once you've built your website, you can easily upload the site to Amazon's Elastic Beanstalk through Visual Studio. Pretty kewl! Google Cloud Platform Ever since I heard Google used C++, Java, Python, and JavaScript, I thought Google was the last company to even glance over at C#. However, with their cloud platform, I'm pretty sure they wanted to compete and support a number of languages to lure other developers into their cloud offerings as well. After looking over their .NET documentation, it's definitely well organized and informative. As a sidenote, other languages supported besides .NET include Node.js, Python, Ruby, Go, PHP, and Java. To get started, I'd recommend: Start with the QuickStart for Windows Download the Visual Studio Extension (warning: It's in beta) Build your first Hello World website With Google now supporting the .NET platform, this provides another avenue for developers. Conclusion Of course, I will probably be using Microsoft Azure for my cloud services, but it's always good to see what the competition is up to as well. The purpose of this post was to make .NET developers aware of other cloud-based services to provide an alternative choice. And personally, I've been looking over the cloud landscape for the past month and didn't even realize these options were available on these platforms. With the cloud becoming more of a necessity in a developer's career, Microsoft, Amazon, and Google continue to make their cloud offerings better than the competition and try to entice developers over to their services instead. With .NET becoming more relevant on cloud platforms, this gives developers another opportunity to utilize C# to build not only cross-platform solutions in Windows, Linux, or iOS, but to also provide numerous cloud platforms (cross-cloud?) to host your website where it makes the most sense.

BlackBerry KEYone review: A tale of a decent phone full of annoyances Jordan Palmer Follow View All Posts 2017/05/04 6:00am PDTMay 4, 2017 9 Plus 1 on G+ 19 Share on Facebook 47 Share on Twitter Total Shares75 Blackberry KEYone News Phone Reviews Reviews Article Contents 1 Specs 2 The Good 3 The Not So Good 4 Design & build¬†quality 5 Display 6 Battery life 7 Audio 8 Call quality & connectivity 9 Camera 10 Software 10.1 BlackBerry apps 10.2 Settings & general UI 10.3 Performance 11 Value 12 Conclusion The KEYone, the latest in the BlackBerry Ltd/TCL collaboration, is a phone that returns to the Canadian brand's iconic roots, for better or for worse. With Nougat and a strong focus on security, the KEYone is aimed at enterprise users and long-time fanatics. Overall, the spec sheet for this phone is nothing chart-topping. The SoC is over a year old at this point and the screen has been downgraded from the year-and-a-half-old Priv's, but using the KEYone was¬†mostly a pleasant experience until after about a week¬†with it. That was when I started experiencing rather noticeable slowdown and other problems. So what does a proverbial return to form for BlackBerry mean in the ever massive Android space? Well, there's not really a simple answer. But let's get going ‚Äî¬†we've got a lot to cover. You don't want to be here all day, do you? The unit that I've been using for the last week and some change¬†is pre-production. There have been a few hiccups with the software along the way, which I'll note in the appropriate section below. Most of these problems will hopefully¬†be fixed before the KEYone¬†is available for sale. Specs Display 4.5" IPS LCD 1620 x 1080; 434 ppi CPU Snapdragon 625 GPU Adreno 506 Software Android 7.1.1 Nougat; BlackBerry Security RAM 3GB Storage 32GB, expandable via microSD Cameras 12MP IMX378 (1.55Œºm) rear, 8MP front Battery 3,505mAh; Quick Charge 3.0 Misc USB Type-C 3.1, fingerprint sensor, 3.5mm jack, physical keyboard, NFC Connectivity 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac, dual-band; Bluetooth 4.2; LTE bands 1/2/3/4/5/7/12/13/20/25/26/28/29/30 Measurements 149.3 x 72.5 x 9.4 mm; 180 g Buy BlackBerry The Good Software The "stock" take on Android with BlackBerry's apps is great. It feels like what Motorola does: functionality added on top of Google's vision. It has the latest security patch and Android 7.1.1. Battery life My time with phones from the likes of Huawei and Xiaomi has somewhat desensitized me to stellar battery life, but the KEYone is definitely above average. Screen The color accuracy, brightness, and viewing angles are spectacular. The screen crisp and more than adequate, despite its odd size and aspect ratio. Fingerprint sensor I am not sure from where the fingerprint sensor was sourced, but it's almost on Huawei's level for speed and accuracy. Seriously, my success rate has been almost perfect. Build quality The KEYone is one hell of a solid device. The aluminium frame combined with the soft-touch back make the phone feel extremely durable. The Not So Good Ergonomics/weight The KEYone is chunky and is a bit difficult to hold. Typing with one hand on¬†the physical keyboard is also a pain. And even though it's only 180 grams, the KEYone feels very dense and heavy. Using it single-handed is not a pleasant experience for long periods. Speaker I know this should go without saying, but the speaker quality¬†on this phone is pretty terrible. Performance Major lag, homescreen redraws, and RAM management issues led to a phone that, after about a week of use, became almost unusable. Design & build¬†quality To give you some perspective on the KEYone and its design,¬†the marketing materials say that the phone is "Distinctly different. Distinctly BlackBerry." That last part, and to an extent the first, is quite true. BlackBerry (well, it's really TCL, but you know what I mean) has opted for what you might call the quintessential look that defined the heyday of Research In Motion. And while that seems like a negative at first glance, the KEYone's design exhibits¬†some modernization in its overall execution. This phone garnered more looks, comments, and questions in my time with it than any other I've used¬†‚Äî I'd say that it comes close to the amount of attention I received when smartwatches were still young. The physical keyboard is what drew people's eyes. The whole front face would throw anyone for a loop, especially when we're starting to see such high screen-to-body ratios these days. Not a single person that I've come across thinks that this is a pretty device... and I agree with them. The KEYone is not beautiful, elegant, slim, or anything else like that; it is aimed at a niche that, in theory, cares little for those things in a pocket computer. From the back, the phone looks fairly unassuming and normal. The soft-touch finish¬†feels¬†like it was ripped off of the good ol' OG Nexus 7. My fingertips glide across the band-aid texture, but when push comes to shove, my hand grips it solidly. Coupled with an aluminium frame, the KEYone feels sturdy, durable... and like a brick. To put this¬†kindly, it is one hell of a chunky phone¬†‚Äî I actually had 2010-2011 phone era flashbacks when I removed it¬†from the box. At 180 grams (6.35 ounces for you Imperial folks), the KEYone gets quite heavy in the hand after prolonged usage. See, I have this odd tendency to support phones with my little finger¬†while I'm using them; BlackBerry has made me decide to try to break that habit. I know that I mentioned it briefly, but let's talk seriously about the KEYone's keyboard. When smartphones were starting to trend toward on-screen keyboards, I was not happy. I liked the tactile response of my Droid and Droid 2, and haptic feedback was just not as satisfying. I had also not learned to type without looking on my G1 or HTC Hero, a problem I did not have with any of my Droids or BlackBerries. I eventually got over myself and became a solid fan of SwiftKey and the navbar¬†that Google brought to Android with Ice Cream Sandwich. Now that I'm all done reminiscing, let's get back to the topic at hand. The KEYone's backlit keyboard is really good, if not a little weird after spending the last several years with a¬†software variant. If I were a keyboard nerd like Ryan, I'd describe the travel distance, tactile feel, and the like ‚Äî I¬†just like my gaming mice and PC hardware. While the keys are much too small for my taste, I found that I actually had very few errors in general usage. Each one is easily pressed and responds with a solid click. The layout is obviously QWERTY (duh), so it's pretty easy to get to the point where you're typing fairly quickly. So far, the only things that have taken me some time to adjust to are the symbol layout and the placement of the left shift key versus ALT. Most of my errors have been activating the alternative mode instead of capitalizing the next letter. If you're into it, there are 52 programmable keyboard shortcuts that can open apps or contacts. For instance, you could assign a long press of 'c' to open Chrome, 'f' to start up Facebook, and so on. There's one catch, though: it's limited to the BlackBerry Launcher. In any other, long-pressing a letter will bring up a phone search for shortcuts and apps that are associated with that key. One of the other interesting features is the flick gesture, which inserts the first SwiftKey-like prediction when you, well, flick your thumb up the board. My biggest gripe about the keyboard is the fact that I have to see¬†it every¬†time that I am using the phone. Whereas the Priv has the sliding mechanism to mask its keyboard when you aren't using it, the KEYone's stares you in the face. This reduces the screen size to 4.5" and a 3:2 aspect ratio. I understand that this design choice was made¬†in the spirit of the BlackBerries of old, but I can't say that I am a fan. And if you don't like the physical keyboard or just don't want to use it all of the time, you can use the software version. However, unlike the Priv, this is not the best option. A full-screen keyboard on this smaller display is not the most pleasant of experiences. The fingerprint sensor is fantastic. Embedded in the space bar, it's lightning quick and very accurate. Only Huawei's sensors have proven so reliable for me, which should tell you something. The front of the phone has the screen, the capacitive navigation buttons, the keyboard, and the front camera (and earpiece/sensors) along the upper aluminium bezel. The back has the rather large camera module (there's still a hump, by the way, despite this thing being a brick) and BlackBerry logo. On the top of the frame, you will find the 3.5mm headphone jack. The left side only has the power button, while the bottom houses the speaker grilles and the USB Type-C 3.1 port. Finally, the right side is home to the SIM tray, volume rocker (which feels cheap and hollow) and what BlackBerry calls the "Convenience Key." Both it and the power button feel only slightly more solid than the volume rocker and I'd honestly rather see¬†one of them be textured or differentiated in some way from the other. Just because they're on opposite sides of the phone does not mean I didn't mix them up from time to time. The Convenience Key is a tertiary button that is customizable and can be mapped to almost any action you want. It can open a certain app, activate one of many shortcuts, or perform a few system functions like power off. At this moment, I have it mapped to Google Now since Assistant is tied to a long press of the home button. Let's just say that I've opened Now a lot more than I usually do. It's cool to see BlackBerry trying to¬†cater in some form to power users by adding in this key. At least this isn't chained to a useless virtual assistant. Overall, the KEYone is well-built, but it is a polarizing device in its design and construction. Some people will love it, while I think that most won't. It doesn't have the sneaky, incognito aspect that the Priv did, which is not necessarily a bad thing. Whether you like the look of the phone or not is entirely up to you¬†‚Äî I'm just not the biggest fan of it. Display When discussing the KEYone's display, most will inevitably focus on the aspect ratio, i.e. its general shape. BlackBerry went with something decidedly more square than what most of us are used to. Despite this, the 1620x1080 IPS panel is crisp, clear, and quite bright. I am rather¬†fond of the color reproduction, and I found this to be one of the more accurate panels that I've used. There's even an sRGB mode. The viewing angles are superb and the screen is just a joy to look at. It also gets very bright for outdoor use. The display is not the KEYone's strongest aspect, but nor is it the weakest. The resolution is more than adequate especially given the total screen size. There really isn't that much more to say on the matter: great screen, awesome colors, but it won't blow you away. Battery life With a 3,505mAh battery, you'd expect the KEYone to last a long time. I mean, that's one of the features that BlackBerry is hoping encourages¬†people to buy this phone. The good news is that it is certainly above average. After using Huawei and Xiaomi devices for the last few months, I have gotten used to a phone that can easily get me through a day, so I am glad that this one¬†continues the trend. During my testing, I had the screen at 100% brightness with plenty of texting, emailing, messaging, and several attempts to¬†watch YouTube videos and play games. Not only did I get over five hours of screen-on-time, but the idle drain on the battery was practically negligible. The largest battery to ever come in a BlackBerry phone and the screen resolution help to contribute to the¬†claim that you can get 26 hours of "mixed use," but if you run low, Qualcomm's Quick Charge 3.0 is supported. When you plug the phone in, you are presented with two options: Charge Only¬†and Boost Mode. The latter is touted as "giving you the most efficient charge possible, even if you only have a few minutes." Good on BlackBerry for making another phone with good battery life. It's pretty damn stellar. Audio When I¬†think of a BlackBerry, I don't always picture a phone with the best sound quality and output. Sure, it might get the job done, but you know what I mean. In all fairness, the KEYone is not meant to be your media player¬†‚Äî rather, it's not supposed to be the one on your desk that pleases your ears the most. It gets the job done, that's about all I can say. The sound that pushes out of the headphone jack is tolerable and works just fine for the gym or other activities where you won't be lugging around high fidelity cans. The external speaker is subpar, even considering that this is a smartphone. For music or notifications, there is plenty of distortion and crackling at 80%+ volume. The cacophony at that level is awful, so I've left the KEYone in vibrate-only most of the time. At least the phone has a good vibration motor. Call quality & connectivity When I first received the KEYone and inserted my SIM card, I was sorely unimpressed. Mobile data would not work due to a problem with the APN settings and the phone presented me with an annoying notification telling me that there was a problem. After some digging and chatting with "people in the know," I found out that this was a known issue with this¬†pre-production build of the software and it was being addressed in preparation for the final release. After manually setting up the APN for my MVNO carrier, my wireless connectivity has been passable. Call quality reached my expectations¬†‚Äî Bluetooth and WiFi have also been reliable. I have had my LG Watch Urbane (Android Wear 2.0), Moto 360, and Samsung Gear S3 connected to it during my entire usage. None have had any issues staying connected, nor did I have trouble with any of the Bluetooth headsets I tried. Reception, however, was another matter entirely. The phone constantly dropped calls or failed to make them at all. I also frequently lost data connection or experienced slower speeds than what I am used to on my carrier. The KEYone also experienced cell signal holes that have never been there¬†‚Äî I went through a hole near my house every day, but all of my other devices were just fine in the same area (same SIM, etc). It was extremely frustrating. Camera I'll admit: I went into all of this not expecting much from the camera. Come on, it's a BlackBerry. But seriously, the KEYone's is legitimately good. It performs well in low-light environments with post-processing that is kind to photos. I'm certainly glad to see BlackBerry carry on where the Priv's camera left off. With all of that being said, it cannot¬†quite¬†hold its own next to¬†the Pixel, GS8/GS7, or even the P10. The KEYone can put out good-quality pictures that are crisp in detail, but with some aggressive smoothing in post-processing.¬†Those of you who pay attention will notice that the KEYone packs the same sensor as the Pixel, the IMX378. While that certainly can lend itself to good photos, it's not the be-all, end-all. My opinion is that this is one of those phones where it's more difficult to take a bad picture. This camera is like a jack-of-all-trades¬†‚Äî you'll get great outdoor, indoor, and nighttime photos. Will they have that so-called "Wow!" factor? Well, that depends on you. Moving around to the front, BlackBerry opted for an 8MP fixed focus, 84¬∞ wide angle shooter. LCD flash is also included. Supposedly, this is best suited for those video conferences where you're not in a position to get somewhere with better lighting. This is the official blurb on the matter: "For times when you have to take a video conference on the go, the device includes an 8MP front camera with fixed focus, LCD flash, and 84-degree wide angle lens." Just own up to the fact that you put in an LCD flash for selfies; there's nothing wrong with that. Wrapping all of this up, let's go over the camera UI. It's basic, but in a good way. In Auto, you are presented with the upper bar that has the settings for flash, timer, aspect ratio, and HDR, as well as¬†the general options. Along the bottom is the gallery preview, front/rear camera switcher, shutter button, mode selection, and visual effects. In the options, you have the control mode, where you choose between auto and manual. Then there's the JPEG fine or standard compression choices, face detection, and video resolution stuff. The KEYone¬†can go all the way up to 4K30fps, but you lose "enhanced video stabilization" above 1080p30, which is kind of a bummer. Contrast this camera app UI with something from Huawei and you'll see why I am a huge fan. There aren't as many options, but what's there is useful and mostly necessary. Good job, BlackBerry. Previous Next Software When the Priv launched a year and a half ago, the general consensus seemed to be that the software was good. Much like Motorola and OnePlus, BlackBerry has gone with a "stock+" take on Android, i.e. where Google's vision is kept intact, but useful features are added on top to better the user experience. The KEYone follows the same logic, though with Nougat 7.1.1 running underneath¬†this time around. The BlackBerry brand is built on security, reliability, and stability. When the company shifted over to Android from the corpse that was BB OS, it brought with it some of the hallmarks upon which it had built its reputation. There was a commitment to updating to¬†the latest monthly security patches, the DTEK security suite, and even some hardware modifications that all helped to ensure users had the safest and most secure take on Android. Now we're here with the KEYone and that focus is still on-point. On the surface, the software looks like stock Android, but there's a bunch running under the hood, from the apps to the settings and options. I'll go through both¬†of those elements in their own sub-sections to follow. I think you'll be as surprised as I was in regard to the level of depth and detail with each addition made. Not all of it is useful, in my opinion, but it's there. BlackBerry apps This is one of the pillars for¬†BlackBerry's plan to draw potential customers. My time with BlackBerry's¬†phones was so long ago that I hardly remember what BB OS was like (and I never even used v10). Even if I did, I can tell you right now that I was not a hardcore user, so the KEYone gave me my first experience with a lot of the apps that BlackBerry loyalists swear by. The Hub app is where it's at, at least in terms of sheer power user capability. This functions as a place where you can see all of your messages, emails, texts, and other related¬†notifications. It pulls from Gmail, your default SMS app, IM services, and various social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, and LinkedIn. Due to the volume of incoming emails and the email-fu that I am forced to do each day, I ignore Gmail in Hub. It was just too difficult since it still doesn't support the tabbed inbox or filters/labels as well as I'd like. You can also set up custom views for Hub, where you select what accounts will show up¬†‚Äî this is how I was able to successfully "ignore" Gmail. For enterprise users, this could be the way you separate your work and personal data. While this is all great, I frankly got bored when trying to make Hub work to my advantage. It can take a lot of work, time, and effort to get it the way you want it. I have no doubt that some people will do this, because there is much power to be had in the app, but it is not for everyone. ¬† Nipping at the heels¬†of Hub in terms of marketing importance, we have DTEK. Though it's still being hyped just like it was when the Priv launched, it¬†remains a mostly useless, feel-good example of the placebo effect. You're presented with red Xs, yellow exclamation points, and green check-marks that denote your level of security in various areas. It's a centralized location to show the average user the basics of Android security, which isn't a bad thing. I suppose I am shrugging it off because I know what I'm doing when it comes to this stuff and my perfectionist/completionist nature hates not seeing green check marks. Since I am not going to change my usage habits, then I might as well not look at annoying yellow exclamation points. For those of you who are wondering what my DTEK status is, I am sitting firmly at "Fair." As annoying as that is, at least I am using¬†a BlackBerry device (because that's one of the security checks). I can sleep a bit better tonight knowing that. If you hit green on all criteria, then your needle will be in the "Excellent" range on the gauge. Good for you. ¬† DTEK is actually worth a damn when it comes to showing what apps are accessing certain permissions and notifying you when they do. Or¬†you can have it¬†inform you when a specific application is requesting certain permissions. For example, I can tell DTEK to let me know¬†when something accesses my calendar or to notify¬†me when Action Launcher alone tries to read it. There are certain people who will love this¬†‚Äî I am not one of them. BBM is here, for some reason. It's still the same old app and I really don't feel like going over it. Basically, if you use BBM then you know what it is. If you don't, you're not missing much. There's still no SMS functionality; Android¬†Messages is your default out of the box. The Calendar app is cool, I guess. It still has the "Meeting Mode," which automatically silences your phone when you're in a meeting according to your calendar. There are also options for creating events in different time zones from the system one and whether or not the app informs you if events conflict. It's a neat take, but I wouldn't call it special. Finally, there are various note-taking, task, password management, and photo markup apps. None are particularly worth paying attention to¬†and I am sure there are better offerings from either Google or other third-party developers. I don't want to waste too much time with them. Settings & general UI Apps are great and all, but what about overall user interface? Like I said, the software is "stock+" Android. It looks, feels, and functions much like Nougat would on a Nexus or Pixel, but there are additional options¬†to play with. Most of them lie in the display settings menu, so I'll address some of them. There's the color balance slider (for cool or warm, or somewhere in between) How you want the Recents menu to look ‚Äî you have the choice of Rolodex, which is the normal way, Tiles, and Masonry A green bar along the edge of the screen that shows the battery level¬†remaining while charging (it's neat and I've seen it before in custom ROMs) An option to double tap to wake/sleep the phone. There's one final piece that I want to address in more detail. It's called the Productivity Tab and it exists as a small white bar on the far right edge of the screen (its position and thickness can be adjusted). If you've used Action Launcher and the Quickpage feature, then that's basically¬†how this works. If you have no idea what I'm talking about, the Productivity Tab pulls out from the side of the screen and has five sections. The first is a calendar widget showing you what you have going on that day or the next. After that¬†is a Hub shortcut to show you any unread messages. Sections 3 and 4 are a todo and contacts list, respectively. Finally, there's a settings sub-menu for the Tab, where you adjust position, transparency, height, thickness, etc. I like the Productivity Tab for little more than the calendar widget, which is exactly what I use the Quickpage for in my default Action Launcher setup. ¬†¬† The other addition you'll see in the system settings is for the Convenience Key, which I mentioned all the way back up closer to the top of this review. It's the thing under the volume rocker that looks/feels exactly like the power button. Oh, yeah, you can map it to open whatever app or shortcut you want. I find it mostly useless. but some may find it to their liking. The sub-menu itself is pretty straightforward: it shows you what the key does, what action is currently assigned to it, the option to clear said action, and a short list of what you can map to it. Here's what's available to choose: "Open app" will bring up a list of everything you have installed "Speed dial" allows you to set a contact to the key (don't do this) "Send message" allows you to open either an email or a text to send to a specific contact "All shortcuts" brings up a long list of all the shortcuts that BlackBerry thinks you could ever use/need. Once you make your choice, that's what the Convenience Key will do until you select something else. It only works when the screen is on and unlocked, so keep that in mind. There's a gestures section, but it only has the toggle for the double-tap power button for camera shortcut. Not sure why this is off on¬†its own, but whatever. The sound settings still has the "Notify during calls" and "Flip to mute" options¬†‚Äî I disabled the former because who needs that. The security area is actually almost stock, except for the picture password. By the way, skip that, too. Developer options has the sRGB mode toggle I mentioned earlier (which always turns itself off when I back out of the menu), but it's missing the OEM unlock entry. Because this is BlackBerry, so no unlocking or rooting for you. Everything else is all the same as a Nexus or Pixel. BlackBerry Launcher, the default out of the box, is pretty basic. You have the option for those keyboard shortcuts and little else of note. After I toyed around with it for a bit, I moved¬†on to Action Launcher. The notification shade and Quick Settings are also just like stock with the same animations and everything. ¬† If you're super paranoid about people peering¬†over your shoulder to look at the stuff on your screen, BlackBerry provides you with the Privacy Shade (via the Play Store). This prevents others¬†from physically seeing private and sensitive content by blocking out everything except for a tiny viewing area. How big this little window is depends on what size you want, but even with Privacy Shade active, you can still interact with your screen. It's neat, I suppose. You can adjust the shape and background transparency via the little menu that appears when the Shade is active. Performance The Snapdragon 625 powering all of this is not too bad of a chip. Though decidedly midrange and a year old at this point, it carried the KEYone along better than I would have thought initially. However, after about a week, the lags, stutters, and hiccups started to settle in, with the most noticeable being¬†exiting the camera app, constant homescreen redraws, and apps not remaining in memory very well. The camera thing was especially bad when I used the power button shortcut to launch the camera from a locked state; exiting after this caused the phone to hang for almost thirty seconds. Following that, there'd be another forty-five seconds of unresponsiveness, even from the fingerprint sensor or power button. Suffice to say, it was quite annoying and dismaying. I am not sure whether this is a bug in the pre-production software or not; regardless, it was irritating¬†and made using that shortcut more than useless. As time went on, the sheer sluggishness of the phone became quite apparent. Animations would lag, the whole OS would hang when launching apps at random intervals, and my homescreen redrew¬†every time I went back home (I used BlackBerry, Action, and Nova Launcher¬†‚Äî all with the same result). I also experienced some seriously aggressive RAM management/problems. As an example, I opened a new app for the first time and needed to sign in. I knew my password, but needed my 2FA code. Switching over to Authy, I grabbed the code and double-tapped the recents button to switch back to the original app... only to find that it needed to reload, requiring my credentials again. After all of that, the 2FA code had expired. Rinse and repeat; I just used Authy on my PC to get signed in after a near instance of rage quitting. That's just a singular example, but things like that happened often. Geekbench 4 was having troubles The Adreno 506 GPU¬†is pretty capable, though. The only problem is that there is no reason to game on this phone¬†‚Äî not only is the screen quite small for such an activity, but the keyboard and overall design of the phone's face make gaming uncomfortable. The GPU is just¬†wasted potential, I'd say. These issues could be related to this pre-production hardware and software, but there was a point at which the KEYone became unusable. These problems persisted through reboots. Performance for the first several days was quite good, but it deteriorated very rapidly. Surprisingly so, actually, which made the disappointment I felt seem worse. I should note that I will be retesting everything¬†with a production model when the phone¬†is released to see if these issues persist. Value As we near the end of this journey review, I'm left with a few¬†questions. The one I will ask and hopefully answer in this penultimate section is this: Is the KEYone worth it? Besides the horribly stylized name and physical keyboard, what is the value proposition of this phone? It will retail for $549 USD, which puts it at the high end of the midrange spectrum. That's still a hefty sum for a year-old SoC and some very fast performance degradation, even though both of those¬†come with a decent screen, good camera, and awesome overall software experience. Even with all of the security stuff and the keyboard, I am not entirely convinced that $549 is a good price. $349 is probably the most that I would pay for this phone, especially when you consider that a Pixel is $100 more than the asking price ($650) or that a OnePlus 3T starts at $440. Both phones come with better internals, a similar overall UI/UX, and better¬†cameras. What makes the MSRP even more painful is the subpar performance (note: again, this could be related to the pre-production hardware/software), something that I cannot in good conscience ignore or fail to mention in this regard. You will be much happier with what OnePlus, Google, and even Samsung have to offer you. BlackBerry is likely going to aim this at the enterprise, which may not care about the price tag as much as us normal consumers. Those users, however, do want a phone that's going to work well no matter what they're doing. The long and short of it is that if you're considering this phone as one of your options, then I'd say go with the OnePlus 3T as the best value for your money; if your budget is a little more flexible, then go with a Pixel or Galaxy S8. If you're really interested in one of these, just wait until they go on sale. Conclusion So who is the KEYone for, exactly? According to¬†BlackBerry, it's meant for: "people who use their phones more for communication rather than media consumption, people who are tired of having the same one¬†as everyone else, people who are professionals and rely on their phone to get things done, and people who are looking for something¬†durable that will last through a busy day." If you want my opinion (and you did just read this whole thing, so why wouldn't you), I would say that the KEYone is for the BlackBerry power user of yore. I never was one, but I do know a few who still¬†talk about their old phones. This phone is for them. Minus the DTEK50 and DTEK60, the KEYone is BlackBerry's (and TCL's) latest real attempt at the Android side of things since the Priv. From my time with it, the KEYone failed at providing a good user experience, even¬†though it is¬†a little eccentric and anachronistic in a cute way. BlackBerry returned to its roots with this phone, its aim fixed squarely on the¬†fans of old. Personally, I happen to prefer the glass slabs that we have nowadays and I think that the KEYone is a relic of a long bygone age. I eventually adjusted¬†to the form factor and physical keyboard, but even after reaching that point, I still did not enjoy typing (versus my current neutral feeling on the matter with the software versions). Simply put, I do not like the KEYone. I do, however, appreciate a solid, well-built device even if it is a brick. But good construction is only a single criterion when evaluating a device for recommendation and I don't think that the average consumer or even an Android nerd would enjoy using this phone. It's kind of ugly, bulky, dense, and one of the main draws, the keyboard, is a novelty at best. This is definitely a niche product and I usually frown on that because it's so limiting¬†‚Äî honestly, that's probably just the business student in me talking. BlackBerry/TCL clearly have a target market for the KEYone that they believe is slavering for it¬†(I am certainly not in it). That being said, narrowing down to a specific demographic does not excuse a poor user experience. I've said it plenty of times in this review, but I'll say it again: I know that the model I have¬†is pre-production hardware and software. Bugs, janks, and other oddities are to be expected. There was supposed to be an update for the review units, but I have not received it as of this writing. I like what the KEYone is trying to be and do.¬†It's a quirky little thing that was actually fun to use sometimes just because it's so different. The "stock+" Android¬†is also quite refreshing and helped to subdue some of my frustrations early on. But being unique with great¬†software cannot carry a phone through the trials that this phone presented. And no, the irony of this is not lost on me¬†‚Äî I usually get the phones with outstanding hardware and bogus software. The Snapdragon 625 is a decent chip in its own right; on paper, I should have never had the problems I did. Odds are, either you have already decided that you want one of these or your company's IT department will purchase them in bulk. In both of those cases, I wish you the best and hope that you have the best experience that this phone has to offer. Perhaps the issues I've had will be fixed with production hardware or a few software updates down the line, or maybe it's all been down to bad luck in the silicon lottery (#jordansluck). But I just have a feeling that the KEYone will go down as one of those Android phones that has a cult following, but is ultimately worth more in a few years as an antique than as a daily driver today.

It probably has its niche, but I agree that the era of the keyboard phone has passed, and for good reason. I'll take my big screen and easy one-handed typing, and honestly, I sincerely doubt I would ever be faster on a hardware keyboard. We're all so used to software boards and such autocomplete wizards that I bet 90% of people out there would never get close to matching their speed with a touchscreen on one of these chiclet boards. I also don't really think the camera seems like anything all that special, at least based on the samples here. Nick Becker Honestly, the physical keyboard was the only reason I was considering getting one of these. What I really want, though, is a new version of the HTC G2/Desire Z. YaKillaCJ I still have 1 in a drawer somewhere. That device was awesome and innovative. Hmm, maybe if HTC should look into the keyboard. Nick Becker I still have mine, too. It's just too old now for modern apps. Good_Ole_Pinocchio Phone with a 625... If you're not getting the Z Play, you're doing it wrong.... And well I completely agree with you on hardware keyboards being ridiculous in 2017 robogo Lenovo P2. Same specs, 5100 mAh battery. steadymobb Will the p2 ever get 7.0 though? Prob not... Sohit Especially considering the LG G6 is on sale for $500 Francois Nguyen I actually HATE most touchscreen keyboards, even if if's for typing small messages. I even hated landscape mechanical keyboards because I always break the sliding mechanism over time -_-. Being used to portrait mechanical keyboards (and old PC keyboards from the 90s) for so long, the only cellphones that lasted for me were a BB Q10 for 2 years (and a Palm Treo 680 for 5 years before that). I abused the heck out of Android Runtime for gathering my most needed apps. I tried iOS for 1 year and never got used to the keyboard. I tried several Android phones that didn't last 3 months for me. I'm glad now that the KEYone will show up in June 2017, even if it's WAY too late for me and I'm ironically not interested in buying it lol. Jack ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà mostly nostalgia. Honestly I will buy it if the price drops to $400 level YaKillaCJ My bet is the lags are due to stock 7.1.1. The 625 is very capable of everyday task proven by other OEMs. Something Xiaomi's Miui has a huge advantage over nearly everyone, optimization while including plethora of features. Proven by the Redmi Note 3 Pro (SD650) and Redmi Note 4x (SD625). Plus this price is just too much and I said it when it was announced. Yet so many nay sayers were upset at my comment siting its niche product. While a Niche allows it to be sold for more than Xiaomi and Huawei offerings, it doesn't justify pricing past Flagship specs. This cost more than OnePlus 3/T, ZTE Axon 7 & Xiaomi Mi5 that offer Flagship specs/hardware, thriving OEMs and update history. Not to mention Miui and OxygenOS. Blackberry should drop the price and use Android 7.0 instead until Google themselves stabilize Android 7.1.x. Miku is Best Vocaloid I don't think it's an issue with the Android version. My Moto Z Play has been running LineageOS ever since it became official and I haven't encountered any lag issues, even after a few weeks. If an unofficial version of 7.1 can run perfectly on the 625, there's no reason OEM 7.1 can't run properly on it. YaKillaCJ My key words were stock. As in they never optimized the Android software. Great examples is how Miui and OxygenOS takes whatever version and clearly tweak and optimize it. So I'm not surprised LOS runs great, it includes a modified/optimized kernel, drivers, blobs, default apps, etc tailored for your device. Throwing straight up stock versions of Android that basically just runs without optimization nor bug fixes is something TCL is known for. Look at Blu for example. HabsSuck what a hate on commentary, come to expect it from some HumbleButBlunt Although I agree with your comment I find it hilarious coming from someone who's screen name is "HabsSuck". DEVVVV Too bad BlackBerry continues to do what got them in trouble in the first place. this is due to total lack of innovation. Blackberry was a one hit wonder and if they don't get someone in there that possesses innovation they are done. HumbleButBlunt They are already done making devices... Nate650 Total lack of innovation!? This phone showcases innovation in many ways, such as the capacitive keyboard which they have a patent on. The same can't be said about the popular iPhone. All Apple has basically done in the last five generations is change the screen size. Michael Tran Does it have always listening "ok google" That would be a dealbreaker for me if it doesn't have it. Pat Richardson Your reasoning about the keyboard does not work for me. "Easy one hand typing" isn't even a thing anymore now that phones are 5.5" to 6" and touch/swype (word prediction selected "tofu") is a pain because of poor predictions. Since there is only one small flag ship phone (Sony xperis compact) one hand typing shouldn't even be an argument against a physical keyboard, which is more accurate, quick, and does not require looking at the keys. Every other word on swipe I swear I have to rewrite because of horrible predictions. And touch doing is no better since you cannot feel the keys I agree with everything else toy said about the phone though. Marcelove Start using Swiftkey and stop complaining...üòâ Pat Richardson That's funny because that's what I'm using ToniCipriani ‚úìp«ù·¥â…ü·¥â…π«ù å I used it. It's sh1t. As with every other bajillion VKB out there. I don't need keyboards that try to learn and output what it thinks I'm typing. I need a keyboard to output what I type, nothing more. Capacitive screens are inherently inaccurate. Imparus The size isn't really an argument when it comes to keyboard, pretty much every keyboard support "one hand" mode, where you can make it smaller, so even if it is big you can still reach all the letters with one hand. Pat Richardson While I can concede to this, phones are no longer small enough for one-hand general use. Trying to tap that top right button with your left hand puts you at risk of dropping your phone, so you mostly operate your phone with two hands anyway. To make a keyboard smaller for one hand typing is counter-intuitive for a screen size that's more operable with two hands. Maybe during situational uses the one handed mode is fine. Anyway, despite this argument the physical keyboard I find is much more accurate and comfortable than touch typing. Chris Oh "LCD" flash??? David Ruddock The screen flashes white. DEVVVV the screen flashes white?? So that must mean only for selfies. what if I am doing a recording? and want to see how it is recording in real time?? ecnjnr Tbmobn fby Uo B Mayoo Did it hurt when you fell on your keyboard? Kieron Quinn Maybe they just put their KEYone in their pocket ecnjnr 6P ;) ecnjnr My virtual keyboard posted this from my pocket, lol. Can't wait for a physical keyboard phone. Mayoo http://whatyearisit.info/img/what_year_is_it.jpg ecnjnr 2017 :) Miku is Best Vocaloid There's something called "locking" you may have heard of it :^) Cinj Still don't understand why BB dumped their own OS in favor of Android, especially since BB10 was capable of running Android apps. That's like buying a Mac just to format the drive and put Windows on it, what's the point? I bought my mom a Blackberry Classic and it's a great little phone especially for more tech challenged people who don't need or want all the bells and whistles that come with the two major players. If BB is going to shift to just making mediocre Android phones, they may as well close up shop already. Francois Nguyen Some reasons I guess (based on my own experience with BBOS 10): - Software AND hardware issues on double-tapping on the hardware keyboard - lack of apps - lack of support from major players (facebook, BB itself) Cinj My response to each point: - No opinion since I haven't encountered this - 99% of apps are garbage so no big deal - You can't as easily help clog the internet with pics of the unimpressive food you just ate, unfunny memes, and "like, share, and type amen or you're going to hell" spam? How will humanity survive??? - Quite the opposite. BB is way less obtuse in it's interface than the constantly changing Android one. Android and it's apps are like a hieroglyphic tile puzzle that keeps getting shuffled with every update. Try teaching a tech illiterate parent how to operate Android, I dare you. - Neither of those really have a distinct advantage over the other. But it's nice to have options all the same. - See previous opinion on apps Not trying to slam you or anything, just giving my take. I think we need more options in the marketplace, not less. That's really my main gripe. But I know that's a fantasy because people generally gravitate towards a duality, so for now we're stuck with iOS and Android until some paradigm shift occurs. Francois Nguyen My responses to your responses lol: - it's not a widespread issue; it's not surprising a lot of people didn't know about it - that 1 % of good and varied apps is what everyone I know (tech illiterate or not) makes the switch to iOS or Android so I wouldn't ignore that - I agree with you on your statement. Most consumers disagree on this, though... My friends ABSOLUTELY need to tell the world what they eat for supper and what they read when they're in the bathroom, for example. - Most people that tried my BB Q10 or any Z10 in kiosk ABSOLUTELY disagree with your statement. They're all biased towards iOS or Android, I know (me too, BTW). But that's how sad the situation is when BB got too late to the consumer market. There's no incentive to switch OS. About teaching Android to a tech illiterate, I always did that to several 65+ years people in my neighborhood who never touched a PC in their daily life because it's too complicated for them. In short, BB OS = complicated, Android = easy, iOS = too easy. YMMV. - That's not a big issue now for developers. It's gonna be an issue when most apps (garbage or not) require Kitkat or later. Lack of incentive for devs = lack of enthusiasm for the platform. Winston Compatibility =/= native support. android apps run TERRIBLY on BB10 Cinj To be fair, most Android apps run terribly on Android too. And you're really not missing anything if you're unable to run most of the schlock that infests the play store anyway. Metallinatus Android apps have Google Play Services on Android, which is essential for a hell load of apps to work.... DEVVVV Chen ruined BlackBerry HumbleButBlunt Looks like the stock market disagrees with you. Nate650 The answer is simple: it didn't sell well and the lack of an ecosystem. Being able to run Android apps is not the same as having access to Google Play. ecnjnr I hope Blackberry resolves the performance issues by launch, or I'm reconsidering my purchase. Thanks for the review Jordan Palmer You and me both. ToniCipriani ‚úìp«ù·¥â…ü·¥â…π«ù å I'm just curious if you guys ever got updates. Some other reviewers stated they got at least 3 updates after receiving the review unit. Jordan Palmer I received a single update after this review went live. So far, it has only fixed some of my cell connectivity issues. Nothing else. Suicide_Note Even if they do that, it's still a mediocre phone. ecnjnr I'm a fan of physical keyboards. This phone is a Moto Z Play with a slightly bigger battery, a newer version of Android, a better camera and a physical keyboard. That's worth $100 to me, but maybe not for you. freshprince_87 Moto Z Play has a bigger battery Nate650 Bigger by a whopping 5 mAh. Miku is Best Vocaloid You can wait for the Moto Mod that will have a physical keyboard. ToniCipriani ‚úìp«ù·¥â…ü·¥â…π«ù å If they do a portrait version that is. Martin Rios Dude it depends on the market... Yeah say that "virtual keyboards are better than physical keyboards, swipe, etc.) but there are some folks that are waiting for the rise (or maybe it's the hype) for these kind of devices. Also another point is this sentence >>> "people who use their phones more for communication rather than media consumption, people who are tired of having the same one as everyone else, people who are professionals and rely on their phone to get things done, and people who are looking for something durable that will last through a busy day" >>> I'M ONE OF THEM. I can give less than a f*ck about aesthetics, ceramic look and all that crap, what I want is to be able to comfortably reply my company emails, open docs, scan paperwork, take crisp photos on the field and not sweating the cold if the phone ever slips from my hand (which I doubt). Sure phone must pass through IT Dept to block lost of sh!t like social media but I have my personal phone for that. I'm hoping a OEM in the near future release a phone with nowadays hardware and inspired by a Nokia E7-00, by the way that's my company device (I rejected a trashy Samsung Grand Prime the company tried to make me use, instead I went to Ebay and got a cheap yet efficient Nokia with a horizontal keyboard, Symbian, a decent camera and EAS capabilities). Nate650 Yea, it's a big issue. I still experience performance issues on my Priv. The Priv would be such an amazing device if they address those issues, but it's already been over a year old and they haven't. Do employees even use their own phones? They have to know about these issues by now. Kawshik Ahmed Does the stock 'Blackberry Launcher' supports Android 7.1's 'Launcher Shortcuts' or you have to use a 3rd party launcher ?? Muzaffar I don't understand that BB named it KEYone instead of Mercury. Venice also looks promising at first but becomes flop latter. Nate650 The name is the least of their problems. The performance issues and price are more important. Muzaffar That's why it becomes a flop. paul4tA I skimmed most of the review and went straight to the performance, because if they haven't fixed that from the PRIV, nothing else matters. I love my physical keyboard and have actually come to appreciate some of the other features over time, but I don't think I can take another year of the terrible performance, waiting sometimes minutes for the software to catch up with me. Nate650 It's interesting that not all the reviews mentioned poor performance. That leads me to believe there is a particular culprit and that it's fixable. Jordan L 2 things: I need this on Verizon for one of my bosses, and where can I buy it? Jordan Palmer Updated the buy link. It's up in the specs. BB will be releasing a CDMA version sometime near the end of the month, I think. John Just hold off for 10 years or so until Blackberry's keyboard patents expire and we'll see it put to use by more competent manufacturers. HumbleButBlunt BB doesn't manufacture devices anymore. Cuvis They still hold the patents, and license them to TCL. ToniCipriani ‚úìp«ù·¥â…ü·¥â…π«ù å Probably earlier, when someone somewhere somehow leaks it China and other knockoff makers start building them. RickMLA Battery pull. Fixes everything. Francois Nguyen Battery is non-removable on the KEYone... ToniCipriani ‚úìp«ù·¥â…ü·¥â…π«ù å Hold the power button for 32 seconds = Battery Pull Reset. JL It¬¥s incredibly horrible! Dragos Lucian So Blackberry is starting to be like an ass itch, and I bet the majority doesn't like that feel. And while we're at it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rla7wt8wKGM djinn123 Just because you don't like PKB's it doesn't mean they aren't for someone else. I'm tired of hearing "who uses PKBs these days" or to that effect. If you can't understand why some people NEED it, then maybe you can just stfu? Stefan Seidel Is the keyboard touch sensitive like on the Priv? That's by far the most favourite feature on my Priv, and I'm sad everytime it doesn't work in an app. Also, as to add something useful to the physical versus virtual keyboard discussion: - multi-lingual virtual keyboards have only come up recently. I frequently write in different languages, and having to manually switch between them just doesn't work (especially when sometimes you insert a word from another language in the middle of a sentence) - I am a Sysadmin and every so often I do need to get in to some server from my phone. Doing that with a on-screen keyboard is nothing short of having a hot iron stamp on your forehead. Having the full screen AND quick and easy access to non-alphanumeric characters is such a huge plus that it would justify any price (if you need it for work/serious business). I agree that using Swype or Gboard with swiping is pretty darn good when it comes down to just blurting out some natural language. Anything beyond that is a pain. Hamilton Jimenez Vasquez I think physical keyboards are way better than touchscreen keyboards, but.... I wouldnt switch my large 5.7 and beautiful screen just to have a nicer keyboard, not in this world. Not sir. dabug91 So annoyed that this phone even exists. Blackberry needs to do the world a favor and permanently exit the smartphone business. They should have closed shop more than 6 years ago. Nate650 And how would that benefit you?

They looked pretty cool, but we don‚Äôt think the technology works on Rome. Maybe it‚Äôs because Rome doesn‚Äôt have as many tall buildings as Utica, but these pictures look a bit like Google needs to step up their 3D game. Google Earth 3D Starting with this shot of Ft. Stanwix, it looks a lot like the regular 2D images you would get from Google Earth. You can kind of make out the ditches and walls of the fort. Google Earth 3D The same goes for this shot of Griffiss. Maybe because the buildings are closer to the ground you don‚Äôt get the 3D effect? Google Earth 3D Here‚Äôs a look at Rome Memorial Hospital in 3D. Or is it? I kind of looks like one of those old pop-up books that is slightly broken. Google Earth 3D Veterans Memorial Park and St. Peter‚Äôs Church are the focus of the last picture. These look much better and more 3D-like than any of the other Rome shots. You can see the church in 3D and even some of the trees. Maybe it‚Äôs the difference in building size that makes 3D work better or maybe the system isn‚Äôt fully ready yet, we‚Äôll check out some more area landmarks to help you decide in the coming weeks.

Columnist Dave Davies breaks down three SEO myths that even rational people believe. Dave Davies on May 5, 2017 at 9:53 am More I was scratching my head trying to decide what to write about this month. Lately, I‚Äôve been writing pieces that focused pretty heavily on technical SEO¬†‚Äî from my technical argument for quality content¬†a few months ago to last month‚Äôs two-part series discussing two recently granted Google patents on how they learn to influence user behavior¬†and¬†guided buying systems with a focus on paid search results. While I‚Äôm obviously a big fan of the tech side of SEO, I thought perhaps it was time to write something a bit more approachable. My head-scratching ended when I got an email from a potential client in the high tech sector, and within it was a simple and fairly logical assumption that can (and likely would) have dire consequences if not corrected. This led me to today‚Äôs article topic: three¬†logical myths about rankings that can destroy a business. I‚Äôm going to begin this piece with the myth that inspired it. Myth #1: All organic traffic is created equal This¬†premise has crossed my Inbox more times than I care to recollect. Here‚Äôs the core myth: If we double our organic traffic over the next year, we will double our sales. Now, this can be true¬†‚Äî in fact, in some cases, doubling your organic traffic can more than double your sales. But one can‚Äôt approach SEO with this idea as a core. Let‚Äôs take the prospective client, for example. They have site structure issues and a large documentation area and blog. The logic is that if you¬†fix the site structure and internal link issues, you‚Äôll start driving more traffic to the documentation and the blog, which is filled with great content. The problem, of course, is that this traffic is likely to be lower-converting traffic, so hitting the organic traffic targets can be done without hitting what really matters: conversions. To avoid myth one, the simple approach is to think about the various sections of your site, put a value on those different sections, and then create a formula to ensure that as you‚Äôre building out the strategy for the various sections of your site, you‚Äôre taking into account the value of that traffic. Let‚Äôs create a simple formula based on the case above. We have a site with product and service pages, a blog and technical documentation. Let‚Äôs assume that organic traffic landing in these sections does the following: Site and product pages (represented by x below) ‚Äî 6 percent conversion rate Blog (represented by y below) ‚Äî 1¬†percent conversion rate Documentation (represented by z below) ‚Äî 2¬†percent conversion rate So, our formula for traffic entering the site at various points, assuming a $100 conversion value, would be: $100 x (0.06x + 0.01y + 0.02z) = revenue Let‚Äôs assume we have $600 in revenue today; that could be attained via 600 visitors entering at the blog: $100¬† x (0.06 x 0 + 0.01 x 600 + 0.02 x 0) = $600 Or 100 visitors on the product pages: $100 x (0.06 x 100 + 0.01 x 0 + 0.02 x 0) = $600 Or 300 visitors to the technical documentation: $100 x (0.06 x 0 + 0.01 x 0 + 0.02 x 300) = $600 It could also be attained with 50 visitors to the product pages, combined with 146 to the blog and 77 to the documentation. You get the idea. $100 x (0.06 x 50 + 0.01 x 146 + 0.02 x 77) = $600 So, if we want to double our revenue, we can‚Äôt simply double the traffic. Let‚Äôs look at the last example. We have: 50 visitors to the product pages 146 visitors to the blog 77 visitors to the documentation This gives us a total of 273 visitors. If we double our traffic, but the additional 273 visitors are all entering at the blog, we end up with: 50 visitors to the product pages 439¬† visitors to the blog 77¬† visitors to the documentation Enter that into the formula and you get: 100 x (0.06 x 50 + 0.01 x 439 + 0.02 x 77) = revenue Which works down to¬†: 100 x (3 + 4.39 + 1.54) = revenue Which gives us a total revenue of $893. So, we doubled traffic but only added about 35¬†percent to the bottom line ‚Äî¬†not anywhere near our goals. The lesson? Not all organic traffic is created equal, but there‚Äôs a simple way to figure out what the strategies you are deploying are likely to yield so you can adjust and focus according to your business goals, not arbitrary traffic goals. Myth #2: It‚Äôs important to outrank your competitors I can‚Äôt even count the number of times that I‚Äôve been contacted by both clients and prospects with the statement, ‚ÄúCompany XYZ¬†is above me. We‚Äôre better than them, and we need to outrank them.‚Äù OK‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs take a beat and wrap our heads around what‚Äôs really being said here. While the statement seems logical, what is actually being said is: Company XYZ is above me for the phrase I looked up. We‚Äôre better than them, and we need to divert all energies away from pursuing ROI goals and focus on one single vanity phrase. What we need to remember is that none of this is actually about ranking for a specific phrase. In fact, the goal of our efforts is not rankings at all, but rather revenue. I don‚Äôt know about you, but if there were higher revenue from ranking in position 21 than position 1, I‚Äôd be working hard to get all our clients to the top of page three. To aid in this, it can be helpful to not just look at keyword volumes using a tool like Moz‚Äôs Keyword Explorer¬†(which puts the numbers in more realistic terms for organic search than Google‚Äôs Keyword Planner), but to use a tool like SpyFu to get a real picture for how a site is doing overall. Let‚Äôs look, for example, at a phrase I was researching just yesterday, ‚Äúbest cpu 2017.‚Äù (Spoiler alert: I‚Äôm upgrading my machine.) Now, I immediately went to the #2 organic search result because it‚Äôs Tom‚Äôs Hardware, and I like the info (admittedly bypassing the featured snippet, which is also Tom‚Äôs, because I knew I wanted to read about the different options and applications). Let‚Äôs say, however, that one of their team gets a bee in their bonnet about not ranking #1 in organic for the phrase and getting beaten by Futuremark.com. What if they divert energies from creating new, rankable content, or working on phrases they don‚Äôt rank for at all, to pushing up for this one phrase because it‚Äôs the only one they‚Äôve looked up and fixated on? This is where a tool like SpyFu comes in handy. Looking at FutureMark, we can get a decent feel for their rankings and traffic with: Now, let‚Äôs look at Tom‚Äôs: If I were Tom, I‚Äôd be looking more at ranking for new phrases and perhaps researching the types of phrases that are losing ground than I ever would about focusing energies at a single position jump against a competitor ranking for a fraction of the terms. And this is just an example of the scenario I‚Äôm referring to. In other situations, people may focus out of the gate on a single vanity term as opposed to a more diversified (read: natural) spread of terms. If nothing else it can be helpful to remember the following: Diversity is security. All else being equal, it is better to have 100 phrases each driving 10 visitors than one phrase driving 1,000. As algorithms ebb and flow, you will be impacted less by the whims of Google. Don‚Äôt fixate on your rank compared to your competitors for one phrase¬†‚Äî make sure you‚Äôre making the right keyword decisions to maximize your ROI and resources. Myth #3: Keyword tools are accurate Bringing people into reality is often¬†a sad but necessary task. A lot of potential clients include with their initial emails the incredible search volumes for the phrases they‚Äôre thinking about. Let‚Äôs flash back a few paragraphs to the part where I mentioned using Moz‚Äôs Keyword Explorer as opposed to Google‚Äôs Keyword Planner. Why is the former more realistic? It‚Äôs because Keyword Planner is built for AdWords traffic and generally produces numbers far above the number of unique searchers that would reach a result via organic. The Moz tool takes this into account and algorithmically (though not perfectly) adjusts for that to give numbers closer to organic reality. For example, the term ‚Äúcpu‚Äù is given an estimated volume of 74,000/mth using the Keyword Planner. Per the Moz tool, we‚Äôd see it ranging from between 30,000 and 70,000. Still a big number, but not the same ‚Äî¬†in fact, if we averaged the Moz numbers, the estimate would be 50,000/month, or around 33¬†percent less. Now let‚Äôs make the scenario even worse (read: realistic). You might rank #1 at some point for your phrase, but it‚Äôs going to be a process. Let‚Äôs be optimistic, however, and assume that a year from now you‚Äôre ranking #3 and hold that ranking for the following 365 days. Instead of dreaming that every single person who runs that search (all 50,000/mth) are going to get to your site, let‚Äôs assume some click-through rate averages. Here‚Äôs what a WordStream study found for traffic by organic position: So we can see here that, in¬†the number three position in organic search,¬†we were sitting at about 12.5¬†percent CTR. That‚Äôs 6,250 visitors to your site. This is very, very different from the 74,000 expected when the email was sent. Not understanding what‚Äôs realistic in regard to the traffic to be gained from a specific phrase when it‚Äôs ranking can lead to critical bad decisions. If you feel you are going to get 74,000 visitors per month for a phrase you‚Äôd actually get 6,250 for, your ROI calculations will be off ‚Äî and you‚Äôd likely focus far more energy and resources into it than it warrants. Understanding the true value of a term or group of terms is paramount to understanding how much attention to put into keyword groups and whether they‚Äôre truly worth targeting at all. Conclusion A lot of mistakes get made before campaigns even begin, and most of them start with a lack of understanding of how keywords and rankings function. No matter how successful the SEO campaign is in regard to the rankings attained, if the principles and data that the efforts were based on are incorrect or misunderstood, then the results can be as catastrophic as if the campaign had simply failed. Following one guiding principle is all it takes to really avoid the biggest issues: understand what you want, and understand a path to that. Wanting more traffic in itself is not a goal; wanting more conversions and revenue is. Focus on that, and when you‚Äôre communicating about strategy, make sure that the discussion is on these business goals and not an abstract idea that, if misinterpreted, could yield actions and efforts that don‚Äôt actually support the business but do technically meet the directives given.

Voice assistants such as Google Home, Apple's Siri and Amazon Alexa have always been susceptible to accidental hijack. Burger King's manipulation of Google Home illustrates the vulnerabilities intrinsic to voice assistants that can be targeted by brands, or worse, hackers. But the stunt might help speed up the next developments for home voice assistants: individual voice recognition and even image recognition. (AP Photo/Eric Risberg, File) .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... ..........NEW YORK ‚Äî Burger King pulled a pretty juicy marketing stunt last month that drew plenty of attention ‚Äî not just to the Whopper, but also to the intrinsic vulnerabilities of a new type of voice-activated gadget. The fast food chain‚Äôs 15-second television ad targeted Google Home, a speaker that can answer questions and control other smart appliances. When an actor in the ad said ‚ÄúOK, Google‚Äù and asked a question about the Whopper, Google Home obediently began reading the burger‚Äôs ingredients in homes around the country ‚Äî effectively extending the commercial for however long it took someone to shout ‚ÄúOK, Google, stop!‚Äù Google and Wikipedia quickly made fixes to shut it down. Though annoying, the stunt may have done some good by highlighting how easy it is to hijack such devices. (Just imagine a burglar spying a voice assistant and asking it to unlock all the doors.) It could also speed the development of home voice assistants with better security. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a wakeup call,‚Äù said Earl Perkins, a digital security analyst at the research firm Gartner. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a harbinger of things to come.‚Äù Advertisement Continue reading TRIGGER WARNING Voice assistants such as Google Home, Apple‚Äôs Siri and Amazon‚Äôs Echo devices have always been susceptible to accidental hijack. A Google ad during the Super Bowl that used the phrase ‚ÄúOK, Google‚Äù reportedly set off people‚Äôs devices. And in a January story that briefly turned a family into media celebrities, a woman‚Äôs 6-year old daughter ordered a dollhouse and sugar cookies simply by asking Amazon‚Äôs voice assistant Alexa for them. Since the devices are so new ‚Äî the Amazon Echo debuted in 2015, Google Home last year ‚Äî they‚Äôre still having growing pains. And they‚Äôre growing in popularity; Consumer Intelligence Research Partners estimates that Amazon sold 3 million Echo devices in the U.S. in the fourth quarter of 2016, bringing the total to more than 8 million. Amazon doesn‚Äôt release sales figures. Many experts believe that deliberate attempts to trigger voice assistants will be short-lived. Among other things, brands have to face the consequences of potentially annoying millions of people. ‚ÄúBurger King was doing what the Burger King brand is known to do, stir controversy and make sure it gets lots of coverage,‚Äù Forrester principal analyst James McQuivey said. ‚ÄúVery few brands want to do that.‚Äù Of course, spammers and other bottom-feeding marketers can still try to implement the technique. But voice assistants already have a few ways to block them. THREATS AND COUNTERMEASURES Amazon already makes sure its TV commercials and those of its partners can‚Äôt inadvertently trigger the speaker. Developers that provide Echo with ‚Äúskills‚Äù that let it, for instance, order pizza, are also prohibited from creating Alexa commands that would trigger ads. Google says it also has techniques to block TV ads from activating Google Home. Neither company provided details on those techniques. Advertisement Continue reading Voice assistants are still in their ‚Äúvery early days,‚Äù Google says; the company plans to ‚Äúmonitor and learn as we go.‚Äù Hackers might also be a threat. But because voice assistants are so new and limited in scope, more established connected devices such as webcams, routers and printers pose more of a threat for now. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not that we won‚Äôt see some creative or unique instance (of hacking), but I don‚Äôt think this is going to be the next great wave of cybercrime,‚Äù said Steve Grobman, chief technology officer at the security company McAfee. MORE SECURITY TO COME But before long, the devices are going to need better security. ‚ÄúWhen you move into a world of voice, some of the rules that we‚Äôre accustomed to, related to security for computers, change,‚Äù Gartner‚Äôs Perkins said. Exactly how that works could depend on exactly what task a voice assistant is performing. Asking about the weather requires less security than say, shopping or accessing a bank account. Amazon already has options for setting up security codes to shop, make financial transactions or unlock and start cars. Of course, someone could always overhear you reciting a security phrase. A better solution, and one that companies are hard at work on, would be to identify a person‚Äôs voice, much the way Google and Facebook identify faces today. Beyond improving security, that technology could help the device personalize recommendations or even ads for the individual, not the whole family. Apple already lets users voice-train its Siri digital assistant so it‚Äôs more likely to activate only when it hears a specific voice. Amazon has a voice training option for Alexa. Google Home can recognize up to six different voices, though it won‚Äôt prevent unauthorized users from activating the assistant. Experts suggest that companies will eventually add cameras to voice assistants. Amazon‚Äôs new Echo Look has a camera, but it‚Äôs for offering fashion advice. Combining a facial scan with voice recognition would definitely beef up security, although they‚Äôll also create new privacy concerns. ‚ÄúWithout any security or minimal security, (voice assistants are) going to be a fat target,‚Äù Perkins said. ‚ÄúThere will be all kinds of innovation associated with compromising these systems.‚Äù Share Tweet LinkedIn Email Print Subscribe Most Recent Biz News Suggested Stories: Burger King to McDonald's: Let's make a McWhopper ‚Äì Aug 26, 2015 Analysts are lukewarm about Google's new gadgets ‚Äì Oct 4, 2016 AP Explains: How Amazon Echo listens and what it stores ‚Äì Dec 29, 2016 Google Home's assistant can now recognize different voices ‚Äì Apr 20, 2017 Advertisement Load comments Comments Subscribe to the Journal for only $12.

There are dozens upon dozens of great options on the market today, but finding the best of the best can be a bit difficult. We‚Äôve seen some great launches through the year and more should be coming soon too, so let‚Äôs take a look at the best Android smartphones you can buy as of May 2017. The best gifts for Android users NEW FOR MAY: Samsung Galaxy S8/Galaxy S8+ After going on sale late last month, Samsung‚Äôs latest pair of flagship phones, the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ are off to a fantastic start.¬†The new bezel-light phones usher in a new design language for Samsung with further revised software with new features like Bixby. The Galaxy S8 is a 5.8-inch device where the S8+ is a 6.2-inch monster, or at least, it would be without this design. Thanks to the thin bezels all around, the S8 and S8+ are both very compact compared to devices with similar or even smaller screen sizes. It‚Äôs impressive both in pictures and in person. Under the hood, the Galaxy S8 packs the Snapdragon 835, 4GB of RAM, 64GB of storage, and a microSD card slot. There‚Äôs also USB-C for quick charging and data transfer, as well as video output via Samsung‚Äôs DeX dock which offers up a full desktop environment when plugged into the necessary peripherals. The S8 also packs Nougat out the box with a cleaner software build. Pricing is for the Galaxy S8 starts at around $750, while the larger S8+ comes in at around $850. Both devices are available now via Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile, Best Buy, and Sprint. Unlocked units are also coming later this month. BlackBerry Keyone The other big release for May is the BlackBerry Keyone, going on sale later this month. This device is a return to the good ol‚Äô days for BlackBerry, including that always-available full physical keyboard right below the display. The KeyOne runs on top of a Snapdragon 625 chipset, 3GB of RAM, 64GB of storage, and has a 4.5-inch display. That sounds small, but it‚Äôs due to the fact that the device has that keyboard below. The phone ships with Android 7.1.1 and the latest Android security patch. Further, it offers up BlackBerry‚Äôs special security enhancements and a surprisingly good 12MP camera on the rear. Obviously, the Keyone isn‚Äôt the phone for everyone, especially at $549, but it is an excellent option nonetheless. Sales of the phone will open up on May 31st with both GSM and CDMA variants on their way. Best Affordable Android Phones ‚Äì May 2017 FROM EARLIER THIS YEAR: LG G6 One of the more impressive debuts to come out of MWC 2017 was the LG G6 ‚îÄ the company‚Äôs new bezel-light flagship for the year. After the failure that was the LG G5, the company needs a win, and it might just have that in the G6. Packed inside of the LG G6 is a Snapdragon 821 chipset, 4GB of RAM, 32GB of storage, wireless charging, USB-C, Android Nougat, Google Assistant, and a 3,300 mAh battery. However, the biggest story here is what you can actually see. First of all, the LG G6 has super thin bezels on all sides, allowing that 5.7-inch display to fit into the footprint of a phone with a much smaller display. Then, there‚Äôs the removal of the modular components, making room for IP68 protection against dust and water. The LG G6 is a pretty solid smartphone, but it‚Äôs not perfect. As we noted in our review, the device still lacks in certain areas such as performance. That said, it‚Äôs still a fantastic device. You can order now from Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile, Sprint, B&HPhoto, and Best Buy. Google Pixel/Pixel XL When talking about the best Android phones, there‚Äôs no way to avoid talking about the Google Pixel and Pixel XL. These two smartphones, designed by Google from the ground up, show off the best that the company has to offer, and it‚Äôs impressive. While not perfect, Google‚Äôs efforts with the Pixel show just how good Android can be, both in terms of stability, performance, and the overall experience. The Pixel packs top-tier specs including the Snapdragon 821 chipset, 4GB of RAM, 32 or 128GB of storage, and the breathtaking 12.3MP camera on the back. Google‚Äôs services are pre-loaded out of the box, the latest version of Android is pushed immediately, and Google Assistant is showcased front and center. Other perks include the 24/7 support, unlimited full resolution photo and video backups, and support for Google‚Äôs all new Daydream VR experience. Pricing for the Pixel starts at $649 for the 5-inch variant and $769 for the larger 5.5-inch Pixel XL. Add $100 to either for the 128GB storage tier. Monthly financing is available both through the Google Store¬†and¬†Verizon Wireless. Huawei P10/P10 Plus MWC 2017 also saw the early debut of Huawei‚Äôs flagship P Series device for 2017 ‚îÄ the Huawei P10. The P10 isn‚Äôt a massive departure from 2016‚Äôs P9, but it still brings some welcome enhancements. First, the P10 has picked up the same great Leica dual-camera system from the Mate 9, and has also brought several new color options to the table, as well as a new, unique metal build. Further, the P10 offers EMUI 5.1 and a new front-facing fingerprint sensor that can double as navigation buttons. The P10 runs on top of the Kirin 960 chipset, 4GB of RAM, 64GB of storage, and a 3,200 mAh battery with Nougat and a 5.1-inch 1080p display. The P10 Plus, on the other hand, brings 6GB of RAM, 128GB of storage, and a much bigger 3,750mAh battery, under a 5.5-inch QHD display. Unfortunately, we don‚Äôt have any details just yet on what the P10 and P10 Plus will cost. Both phones are available now overseas, but they won‚Äôt be coming to the US. You can read our full review here. Honor 8 Pro Another option that won‚Äôt be coming to the US, but is quite solid is the Honor 8 Pro. Announced this month for European markets, the Honor 8 Pro packs a metal build, dual-camera, powerful specs into a fairly affordable device. Under the hood, you‚Äôll find the Kirin 960 chipset, 6GB of RAM, a massive 4,000 mAh battery, USB-C, and 64GB of speedy UFS 2.1 storage. Of course, Android Nougat and EMUI 5.1 are also included. Pre-orders are live now for European customers. OnePlus 3T Announced toward the end of 2016, the OnePlus 3T is the successor to the OnePlus 3, although it‚Äôs really just a slight refresh. Compared to the OnePlus 3 the 3T brings the updated Snapdragon 821 chipset, a larger 3,400 mAh battery, a new color variant, and an updated 16MP front facing camera sensor. Aside from that, the OnePlus 3T is the same as the OnePlus 3, bringing Dash Charge fast charging, a 5.5-inch 1080p Optic AMOLED display, 6GB of RAM, and USB-C ‚Äî all wrapped up in that aluminum chassis. Starting at $439, it‚Äôs slightly more expensive than the OnePlus 3 was, but not without reason. The phone is available now from OnePlus‚Äô website. You can even pick up the limited edition black model‚Ä¶ Huawei Mate 9 (US Release) As expected, Huawei launched the Mate 9 in the US market at CES 2017 for the pretty reasonable price of $599. Packed inside of its gorgeous aluminum design, the Mate 9 has Huawei‚Äôs in-house Kirin 960 chipset, 4GB of RAM, 64GB of storage, a dual-camera system, a 5.9-inch 1080p display, and Android Nougat. Alongside Google‚Äôs latest OS, Huawei has also included the latest version of its EMUI software skin, and it‚Äôs finally pretty good. The Mate 9 will also be updated in the coming weeks to include Amazon‚Äôs Alexa digital assistant in place of the Pixel-locked Google Assistant. We‚Äôll be revisiting the device soon, but in the meantime, you can read our full review here and buy the phone from Amazon, Best Buy, B&H Photo, Jet.com, or Newegg for $599 unlocked. It works on any GSM carrier including T-Mobile and AT&T. LG V20 If you want a big, feature-rich phone that doesn‚Äôt explode, the LG V20 might be your best bet. Packing a 5.7-inch Quad HD IPS display, Snapdragon 820 chipset, 4GB of RAM, 64GB of storage, and a 3,200 mAh removable battery, the V20 is a power user‚Äôs phone without question. This is only emphasized with the dual-camera system on the back which can take standard and wide-angle pictures as well as bringing enhanced stabilization in video. Entertainment only gets better with the built-in 32-bit HiFi DAC which makes listening to music a joy. The LG V20 is one of the best smartphones we‚Äôve used this year, but the most surprising thing about it is the price. While a similar option from Samsung, Apple, or Google could cost you well upwards of $800, the V20 averages out at about $770. Pricing varies by carrier, landing at $672 on Verizon at its lowest point and $830 on AT&T and its highest. Monthly pricing across all major carriers lands at around $28 a month and the phone is available via Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile, US Cellular, and Sprint. You can also pick it up unlocked. We‚Äôve also seen some pretty spectacular deals on the phone, cutting the price by hundreds. Moto Z/Moto Z Force From Motorola/Lenovo, one, or rather two, of the best options you can pick up come in the form of the Moto Z and the Moto Z Force. Both devices pack 5.5-inch AMOLED displays, the Snapdragon 820 processor, 4GB of RAM, 32GB of storage, and Motorola‚Äôs thin software layer on top of Android. The Moto Z brings a 2,600 mAh battery, 13MP camera, and comes in at just 5.2mm thin. The Moto Z Force, on the other hand, brings a 3,500 mAh battery, 21MP rear camera, and is 7mm thin. It also brings a ‚ÄòShatterShield‚Äô display which won‚Äôt break. Unfortunately, that model is exclusive to Verizon Wireless. Both devices run on top of Android Nougat, and lack headphone jacks. However, they do include USB-C adapters in the box. That port also includes Turbo Charging which promises up to 15 hours of power with a 15-minute charge. Both are also compatible with Google‚Äôs Daydream VR platform. The big story, though, is without a doubt the compatibility with Moto Mods, a method of expanding the phone‚Äôs capabilities with modules such as battery packs, speakers, and even a camera. The Moto Z Force is available on Verizon Wireless¬†as is the Moto Z, but the latter is also available unlocked through outlets like Amazon. ZTE Axon 7 If you want a flagship experience, but at a slightly lower price point, the ZTE Axon 7 is an option worth considering.¬†Starting at just $399, the Axon 7 packs a 5.5-inch AMOLED display, all-metal design, front facing speakers, and premium specifications including the top of the line Snapdragon 820 chipset. It also packs an insane 6GB of RAM and support for Google Daydream, all while running on top of Android Nougat. The ZTE Axon 7 is available for purchase from ZTE, Amazon, and many other retailers around the web for $399 unlocked for use on GSM carriers.

With just a few clicks, Google Photos can make a video based on your library to share with your mother next week (it‚Äôs coming up soon on¬†May 14th!)‚Ä¶ Everyone can use an Echo Dot: Just $50! 1. Head over to Google Photos The first thing you need to do, as Google notes on The Keyword, is head over to¬†photos.google.com/mothersday. From there, you want to make sure you‚Äôre signed into the correct Google account. Obviously, you‚Äôre going to need to be signed into the account that has the bulk of the photos or videos you want Google to pull from for this video. 2. Pick a mom and some kids From there, Google will prompt you to pick a mom (it only lets you pick one for this selection). Click next, and you‚Äôll be able to pick the kids you want to appear in the video with her. For the kids side of things, you can pick as many people as you want (seriously, Google Photos let me pick all 76 people that were recognized in my library ‚Äî Google doesn‚Äôt discriminate against family size). 3. Wait After this, you‚Äôll be presented with the following page, which tells you that the Photos Assistant is busy working on your video in the background. 4. Share! From there, just click the ‚ÄúGo to Assistant‚Äù button, and wait a few minutes. As soon as your Mother‚Äôs Day video is finished, it should appear in your Assistant feed (you might need to reload the page). The only step left once the video is complete is to give it a quick watch (to make sure you like it!), and share it or save it. Click the share button will let you share to other people on Google Photos and external social networks like Facebook and Twitter. And click save will save to your Photos library. More Google Photos coverage: Google Photos‚Äô new video stabilization feature is pretty impressive, as shown off in these¬†demos Google Photos for Android adds support for video stabilization, possible Google+¬†integration Google Photos adds faster backup & sharing in low connectivity, improved upload¬†UI Stephen Hall @hallstephenj Stephen is Managing Editor at 9to5Google.

The fast food chain‚Äôs 15-second television ad targeted Google Home, a speaker that can answer questions and control other smart appliances. When an actor in the ad said ‚ÄúOK, Google‚Äù and asked a question about the Whopper, Google Home obediently began reading the burger‚Äôs ingredients in homes around the country ‚Äî effectively extending the commercial for however long it took someone to shout ‚ÄúOK, Google, stop!‚Äù Google and Wikipedia quickly made fixes to shut it down. Though annoying, the stunt may have done some good by highlighting how easy it is to hijack such devices. (Just imagine a burglar spying a voice assistant and asking it to unlock all the doors.) It could also speed the development of home voice assistants with better security. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a wakeup call,‚Äù said Earl Perkins, a digital security analyst at the research firm Gartner. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a harbinger of things to come.‚Äù Sign up for the online chat with Col. Brandon Pearce, NGA's chief information security officer, May 15, 12:30 p.m. Advertisement TRIGGER WARNING Voice assistants such as Google Home, Apple‚Äôs Siri and Amazon‚Äôs Echo devices have always been susceptible to accidental hijack. A Google ad during the Super Bowl that used the phrase ‚ÄúOK, Google‚Äù reportedly set off people‚Äôs devices. And in a January story that briefly turned a family into media celebrities, a woman‚Äôs 6-year old daughter ordered a dollhouse and sugar cookies simply by asking Amazon‚Äôs voice assistant Alexa for them. Since the devices are so new ‚Äî the Amazon Echo debuted in 2015, Google Home last year ‚Äî they‚Äôre still having growing pains. And they‚Äôre growing in popularity; Consumer Intelligence Research Partners estimates that Amazon sold 3 million Echo devices in the U.S. in the fourth quarter of 2016, bringing the total to more than 8 million. Amazon doesn‚Äôt release sales figures. Many experts believe that deliberate attempts to trigger voice assistants will be short-lived. Among other things, brands have to face the consequences of potentially annoying millions of people. ‚ÄúBurger King was doing what the Burger King brand is known to do, stir controversy and make sure it gets lots of coverage,‚Äù Forrester principal analyst James McQuivey said. ‚ÄúVery few brands want to do that.‚Äù Of course, spammers and other bottom-feeding marketers can still try to implement the technique. But voice assistants already have a few ways to block them. ‚ÄòIf you‚Äôre a really good federal worker, you should welcome‚Äô the reorganization plan, OMB says THREATS AND COUNTERMEASURES Amazon already makes sure its TV commercials and those of its partners can‚Äôt inadvertently trigger the speaker. Developers that provide Echo with ‚Äúskills‚Äù that let it, for instance, order pizza, are also prohibited from creating Alexa commands that would trigger ads. Google says it also has techniques to block TV ads from activating Google Home. Neither company provided details on those techniques. Voice assistants are still in their ‚Äúvery early days,‚Äù Google says; the company plans to ‚Äúmonitor and learn as we go.‚Äù Hackers might also be a threat. But because voice assistants are so new and limited in scope, more established connected devices such as webcams, routers and printers pose more of a threat for now. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not that we won‚Äôt see some creative or unique instance (of hacking), but I don‚Äôt think this is going to be the next great wave of cybercrime,‚Äù said Steve Grobman, chief technology officer at the security company McAfee. MORE SECURITY TO COME But before long, the devices are going to need better security. ‚ÄúWhen you move into a world of voice, some of the rules that we‚Äôre accustomed to, related to security for computers, change,‚Äù Gartner‚Äôs Perkins said. Exactly how that works could depend on exactly what task a voice assistant is performing. Asking about the weather requires less security than say, shopping or accessing a bank account. Amazon already has options for setting up security codes to shop, make financial transactions or unlock and start cars. Of course, someone could always overhear you reciting a security phrase. A better solution, and one that companies are hard at work on, would be to identify a person‚Äôs voice, much the way Google and Facebook identify faces today. Beyond improving security, that technology could help the device personalize recommendations or even ads for the individual, not the whole family. Apple already lets users voice-train its Siri digital assistant so it‚Äôs more likely to activate only when it hears a specific voice. Amazon has a voice training option for Alexa. Google Home can recognize up to six different voices, though it won‚Äôt prevent unauthorized users from activating the assistant. Experts suggest that companies will eventually add cameras to voice assistants. Amazon‚Äôs new Echo Look has a camera, but it‚Äôs for offering fashion advice. Combining a facial scan with voice recognition would definitely beef up security, although they‚Äôll also create new privacy concerns. ‚ÄúWithout any security or minimal security, (voice assistants are) going to be a fat target,‚Äù Perkins said. ‚ÄúThere will be all kinds of innovation associated with compromising these systems.‚Äù Related Topics All News Business News Technology News Leave A Comment Home ¬ª The Associated Press ¬ª Business News ¬ª How Burger King revealed‚Ä¶ Partners FEDERAL INSIGHTS The Associated Press Government News U.S. News Business News World News Technology News Entertainment News Sports News Today in History 1961: First American launched into space Fed Photo of the Day Librarian of Congress practices to throw first pitch at ballgame Top Stories Congress finds family life at the root of military personnel issues Top Story Trump signs $1 trillion spending bill, keeps government open Budget In planning for the reorg, Price encourages employees to help him ‚Äòreimagine‚Äô HHS Workforce Recently declassified Pentagon weapons office says rapid prototyping is secret to its success Defense News Trump‚Äôs pick for Army post drops out amid growing criticism Army THRIFT SAVINGS PLAN TICKER May 05, 2017 Close Change YTD L Income 18.8669 0.0301 2.24% L 2020 25.4964 0.0785 3.69% L 2030 28.4407 0.1372 5.24% L 2040 30.6406 0.1738 6.00% L 2050 17.5796 0.1134 6.69% G Fund 15.3108 0.0009 0.78% F Fund 17.7156 0.0080 1.75% C Fund 33.3025 0.1363 7.16% S Fund 43.3795 0.3565 5.78% I Fund 27.7982 0.3796 10.16% Closing price updated at approx 6pm EST. each business day.

With Android O developer preview out in the world, the company has now confirmed that the Android Nougat Beta Program is complete and that no new builds will be released to the public beta testers. Android O public beta rolling out soon; possibly around the I/O event While most of the new preview builds are buggy to say the least, Android fans eagerly wait for them to try and test the world of new features and changes coming to Android. Google has now confirmed ending the Nougat Beta Program. Related Will Google Read Your Mind to Offer ‚ÄúCopyless‚Äù Pasting on Android? Nope, Won‚Äôt Be That Cool ‚Äì Yet Thank you for your interest in the Android Beta Program! The beta for Android Nougat has concluded, and all devices that were opted in have been updated to the current public version. If you are still running a beta version of Nougat, you may download the latest full OTA image for your device and sideload it. This will not wipe your device. We‚Äôll update this site when the Android O Beta Program begins. With the completion of Nougat Beta Program, it doesn‚Äôt mean that you won‚Äôt have anything buggy to try on your Nexus and Pixel devices. Google has shared that the Android O Public Beta Program will soon start. The release of Android 7.1.2 Nougat marked the end of Android Nougat Beta Program. Google added that the beta website will soon be updated when the Android O public beta is ready to be rolled out. It should be noted that the Android O developer preview began a couple of months back. However, Google is yet to upgrade it to the public beta program. The second Android O developer preview is planned to be released in the middle of this month, which is when we are expecting to see the first Android O public beta to be made available. The release of second Android O developer preview will probably coincide with the Google I/O developer event that will take place between May 17 to May 19.

Hot rollers weren't¬†just for your mom in the '80s‚Äîthey're also truly one the of best ways to get bouncy,¬†Victoria's Secret-level volume¬†that seriously lasts. To start, brush through your hair (if you have curls, blow them out or lightly straighten them, first), then section off a three-inch chunk¬†of hair at your roots. Lift the hair up and pull it forward at an angle, then place a heated roller underneath the ends and roll it down, securing the roller against your scalp with the included clip. Repeat with the front sections of hair on either side of your part, then continue with the rest of your hair. PRODUCTS TO TRY: 1. T3 Volumizing Hot Rollers Luxe, $119; at T3 2.

Seriously‚Äîwait until your rollers (not just your hair, but the actual rollers) are¬†totally, 100-percent cold before unrolling them. Photo: Tory Rust STEP 3: Unravel Now for the fun part: The big reveal. Starting with¬†the last roller you rolled, remove the clip and gently unravel the hair. Continue unclipping¬†and unrolling, letting¬†your curls hang loose and untouched. Photo: Tory Rust STEP 4: Add some texture To keep your volume from deflating by the end of the hour, you'll need to add some grip and texture to your (now) ridiculously soft hair. Blast your hair from root to tip with a veil of texturizing spray, then gently brush through your curls with a paddle brush, like the EcoTools Smoothing Detangler Brush, until your hair is soft and bouncy.

Dan Goodin - May 5, 2017 3:14 pm UTC Enlarge Arp et al. reader comments 193 Share this story Almost a year after app developer SilverPush vowed to kill its privacy-threatening software that used inaudible sound embedded into TV commercials to covertly track phone users, the technology is¬†more popular than ever, with more than 200 Android apps that have been downloaded millions of times from the official Google Play market, according to a recently published research paper. Further ReadingBeware of ads that use inaudible sound to link your phone, TV, tablet, and PCAs of January, there were 234 Android apps that were created using SilverPush's publicly available software developer kit, according to the paper, which was published by researchers from Technische Universitat Braunschweig in Germany. That represents a dramatic increase in the number of Android apps known to use the creepy audio tracking scheme. In April 2015, there were only five such apps. The apps silently listen for ultrasonic sounds that marketers use as high-tech beacons to indicate when a phone user is viewing a TV commercial or other type of targeted audio. A representative sample of just five of the 234 apps have been downloaded from 2.25 million to 11.1 million times, according to the researchers, citing official Google Play figures. None of them discloses the tracking capabilities in their privacy policies. Enlarge / Five of the 234 apps that were built using the SilverPush SDK Arp et al. "The example of SilverPush highlights how easily this technology can be used to spy on users," Erwin Quiring, one of the researchers, wrote in an e-mail. "In this way, they can track the TV viewing habits of users precisely even with traditional broadcasting technologies. In our research paper, we identified three further privacy risks that can occur with this technology, e.g., tracking locations, behavior devices, and even the de-anonymization of Tor users." SilverPush founder Hitesh Chawla said the finding surprised him because his company abandoned the ad-tracking business in late 2015. "We respect consumer privacy and would not want to build our business foundation where the privacy is questionable," he told Ars. "Even when we were live, our SDK was not present in more than 10 to 12 apps. So there is no chance that our presence in 234 apps is possible. Every time a new handset gets activated with our SDK, we get a ping on our server. We have not received any activation for six months now." The researchers, however, stand by the figure and say that all 234 apps positively contain the SilverPush SDK. That means phones that have the apps installed are silently listening for ultrasonic sounds without the knowledge or consent of their owners. While the researchers were unable to find any beacons in TV audio, they compared successful detections with finding a needle in a hay stack and left open the possibility such beacons are actively being embedded into TV audio. Even if they're not actively used, the growth in apps signals the practice could become widespread in the near future. The results were drawn from a corpus of 1.3 million Android apps submitted to the VirusTotal file scanning service, and as a result they shed no light on how prevalent audio beaconing may be in apps running on iOS devices from Apple. A Google representative said that the privacy policies enforced on all apps available in the Play market require developers to "comprehensively disclose how an app collects, uses and shares user data, including the types of parties with whom it's shared." The representative didn't respond to a follow-up question asking why none of five apps cited in the research findings disclosed the SilverPush functions. At the time this post went live, all five apps remained available in Play. The beacons are frequencies from 18kHz to 20kHz, a range that is inaudible to most humans but can be reliably detected by most phone microphones. By embedding them into audio, marketers can track the whereabouts of shoppers as they move throughout a large department store. Promoters using other companies' audio-beacon technologies can also use them to push ads or coupons to people who are near a certain store or service. The researchers said two services‚ÄîShopkick and Lisnr‚Äîuse ultrasonic beaconing for legitimate purposes such as these, and they disclose the tracking prominently. The tracking can also be used for purposes that are decidedly less ethical. Advertisers, for example, may use the beacons with no disclosure at all to measure how often a particular TV ad is viewed. The technology can also be covertly used to perform cross-device tracking that allows marketers to tie a single person to the multiple media devices she uses. The researchers said the beacons could similarly be used to identify people using the Tor anonymity service. This paper was published at the 2nd annual IEEE European Symposium on Security and Privacy and was presented last week in Paris, France. In the paper, the researchers wrote: In summary, an adversary is able to obtain a detailed, comprehensive user profile by creating an ultrasonic side channel between the mobile device and an audio sender. Our case study on three commercial ultrasonic tracking technologies reveals that the outlined tracking mechanisms are not a theoretical threat, but actively deployed (e.g. Shopkick and Lisnr) or at least in the process of being deployed (e.g. SilverPush). The 234 detected apps contain SilverPush functionality alongside their normal content. Many were developed for large companies such as McDonald's and Krispy Kreme. At the moment, there are a limited set of countermeasures to prevent such tracking. For people using version 6.0 or higher, they can disable an app's access to the device microphone. This is a good practice to follow in general, although it may prevent useful features such as voice-to-text from working. It's also a good idea to limit the number of installed apps. Longer term, antivirus providers may be able to add features that detect the tracking during routine scans of installed apps. Another long-term solution is to lobby government regulators, Google, Apple, and other companies to strictly enforce clear and prominent disclosure of all ultrasonic-based tracking.

In December 2015, a Salesteam from Shazam music recognition app came by our office in Amsterdam to sell ads targeted and synchronized with TV commercials. Earlier that year they had done this with several big US advertisers: iPhones (and/or Android devices, I don't remember but their pitch was specific about the supported platform) with the Shazam app were constantly listening via the phone mic, when they recognised a Pepsi commercial, the app would register this and next time you open Shazam you would see a targeted ad. You had the ability to then target users even in other ad-supported apps and follow them via the Apple Advertising ID. Did I mention this all happened in 2015 ? We immediately decided not to use this type of targeted advertising. Listening to our clients (advertisers) consumers 24/7 should not be necessar to sell your brand or product. It is sad actually if an advertiser thinks he/she needs this. The ad business is a lucrative market and every content provider wants in, this doesn't mean advertisers should just go for every available‚Äã tech and should certainly not be too much dependent on Googles or Facebooks ad business. 7 posts | registered 7/20/2016 shelbystripes Ars Scholae Palatinae jump to post zilexa0 wrote: SHAZAM!

Shazam is an app that does nothing but listen to audio and transmit samples back to a server for analysis. The key thing is, people can control whether or not the app listens full-time. And at least on the iPhone, whenever Shazam (or any app) is using the microphone in the background, iOS displays a big red warning at the top that the microphone is in use, and by which app. It looks just like the blue warning that GPS is in use or the green active phone call notification, it's just a different color (and it doesn't get more obvious than red). If you don't like this feature listening all the time, you can turn it off, and the lack of red bar confirms that it's not listening in the background. If you're intentionally letting someone listen in and controlling when they do it, and you're made aware when they're doing it, then at least it's your own choice. 2333 posts | registered 6/13/2013 Dan Goodin Dan is the Security Editor at Ars Technica, which he joined in 2012 after working for The Register, the Associated Press, Bloomberg News, and other publications.

John Stillwell PA Wire/PA Images (Bloomberg) -- YouTube plans to produce a half-dozen original series that will be available for free on the world‚Äôs most popular video website, a big expansion of the Google-owned company‚Äôs programming and efforts to attract advertisers. Comedian Kevin Hart, talk-show host Ellen DeGeneres and the comedy duo Rhett & Link are producing unscripted shows that will debut this year, YouTube will announce at an event for advertisers in New York Thursday. Alphabet Inc.‚Äôs Google also will increase its spending on YouTube Red, a paid video and music streaming service launched in October 2015. ¬© Lucas Shaw and Mark Bergen BC-YOUTUBE-VIDEO-SLATE The plans mark a shift for Google, which has typically treated its huge video library as a web free-for-all rather than a home for TV shows.¬†But as more digital rivals venture into high-quality programming, YouTube is feeling pressure to respond, devoting resources to more costly projects and aiming for a wider audience. The company will fund more than 40 original shows and movies in the next year, spending hundreds of millions of dollars, according to a person familiar with the plans. YouTube is betting high-profile stars will attract more advertisers like Johnson & Johnson, which is sponsoring ‚ÄúBest.Cover.Ever,‚Äù a music competition from Ryan Seacrest that‚Äôs scheduled for later this year. Quotes in the article Johnson & Johnson JNJ ‚ñº 123.51 -0.44 -0.36% Omnicom Group Inc OMC ‚ñ≤ 83.69 +0.76 +0.92% ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre working with YouTube stars and big celebrities that we know have global appeal, advertiser appeal and are largely established on the platform,‚Äù Susanne Daniels, YouTube‚Äôs head of original content, said in an interview. YouTube‚Äôs mission at the annual Newfront presentations in New York, where online companies are introducing their latest initiatives this week, is to convince marketers to shift more ad money to the web from TV. Original programming is front and center, with YouTube pitching premium shows that it says merit big commitments from sponsors. Those efforts got more complicated last month when advertisers discovered some of their spots appeared next to extremist videos. YouTube adopted new rules and said the scandal had minimal impact on sales. Still advertisers are wary of a site that relies on so many user videos, which makes it harder to ensure ads run alongside high-quality shows. Who‚Äôll Blink? Load Error ‚ÄúThe two biggest players in the Newfronts are YouTube and Hulu, yet neither tells you exactly where your ad ran,‚Äù said Ben Winkler, chief investment officer of OMD USA, part of the Omnicom Group Inc. advertising company. ‚ÄúI expect YouTube will be the first to blink.‚Äù DeGeneres, who hosts one of the most popular talk shows on TV, will take viewers behind the scenes of her program. Hart, a popular comedian, will try a different trendy workout routine every week alongside celebrity guests in ‚ÄúKevin Hart: What the Fit?‚Äù The show will debut on his Laugh Out Loud Network on YouTube. YouTube also will help Rhett & Link expand on their already popular ‚ÄúGood Mythical Morning‚Äù to create a series that feels every bit as grand as TV talk shows. While most recent episodes feature the two hosts at a desk, the revamped version, in its 11th season, will include more guests, challenges and correspondents. ‚ÄúWe want to be seen as legit in ways by people who don‚Äôt see internet shows as legit,‚Äù said Rhett, whose real name is Rhett James McLaughlin. ‚ÄúBut the way to do that is not to imitate late-night TV shows.‚Äù YouTube decided to fund ad-supported programs more than a year ago after executives saw a study on the growing number of TV shows being produced. Most of the new shows appear on premium services with no ads. That created an opening. Global Scale ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre turning the infrastructure we‚Äôve built for original programming into supporting our biggest partners,‚Äô‚Äô¬†Robert Kyncl, YouTube‚Äôs chief business officer, said in an interview. ‚ÄúNobody is doing it the way we are. Nobody can release originals on a global basis with the scale we have in advertising.‚Äô‚Äô YouTube‚Äôs parent Google reported more than $21 billion in ad sales in the first quarter -- more than the entire U.S. TV industry. Google has already captured ad budgets that went to print. Now the company wants a larger share from TV. The funding of shows with commercials won‚Äôt reduce YouTube‚Äôs commitment to the $9.99-a-month Red, which doesn‚Äôt have ads. The company backed almost 30 programs on Red last year, and plans to spend even more this year and next. YouTube has talked to partners about releasing programs on Red that cost $3 million to $6 million per hour -- budgets comparable to HBO and Showtime, said the person, who asked not to be identified discussing the private spending plans. The big question for Hollywood -- and advertisers -- is where YouTube may go next. Five years ago, the company invested $100 million in dozens of projects, including ones from comedian Amy Poehler and basketball star Shaquille O‚ÄôNeal. YouTube then shifted strategy, supporting popular filmmakers and actors with promotional campaigns and production facilities in major cities instead. YouTube operates large studios in nine cities, including Los Angeles, London and Mumbai. YouTube is taking a different tack with these new shows. For the new lineup, YouTube recruited a mix of traditional stars and new ones -- all of whom have large followings. Demi Lovato, who allowed cameras to follow her while writing and recording a new album, has more than 10 million subscribers on her Vevo channel. DeGeneres has almost 20 million on YouTube, while ‚ÄúGood Mythical Morning‚Äù tops 12 million.

But how much personal data are you sharing about yourself along the way? Whatever your phone of choice, you're signing away a good chunk of privacy every time you boot it up: these devices want to know how many steps you're taking, where you're travelling, what you're searching for, and more. Here's how to take back some control. Quotes in the article Apple Inc AAPL ‚ñ≤ 148.96 +2.43 +1.66% Android Logging into and using an Android phone means you're adding extra bits to the data hoard Google already has on you‚Äîbuilt from services like Google Search, Chrome, Gmail, and everything else Google runs. In a lot of cases what your Android phone knows about you is the same as what Google knows about you. However, some of Google's tracking is based mainly on your phone. Google Fit, for example, will measure your steps and your activity unless you tell it not to‚Äîif you don't like this, uninstall the app (if your model of phone lets you), or switch off tracking in the Settings section of the menu. You can delete your Google Fit history from the same screen. ¬© Provided by Future Publishing Ltd. Another big part of the way Google tracks you on mobile is of course your location, so it can track your daily commute, learn about your favourite places, and so on. If you find this a bit too intrusive, select Settings from the menu inside Google Maps, then tap Personal content and Location history: turn this option off and location data from your current device won't be added to the database of travels Google Maps on you. There's a separate Location option in the main Android Settings app, which controls location tracking for the device as a whole and other apps besides Google Maps. To completely block Google and every other app from following you around, turn this off (just hope you don't get lost in a strange place in the near future). As we've already mentioned, everything you do in Android feeds into what Google already knows about you, including web searches and voice searches you run‚Äîto view and delete this information, or stop tracking altogether, go Settings then tap Google and Personal info & privacy. Tap Activity controls to put a stop to anything from voice search logs to tracking of your mobile browsing history. iOS Apple is often keen to differentiate itself from Google in terms of its privacy policy and as part of that a lot of the stuff you do on your iPhone stays on your iPhone (although individual third-party apps may not stick to that principle - see below for more). Load Error Any data that Siri learns about you, like how you pronounce words or where you live, is linked to your device through a random ID, rather than being liked to your Apple account - if you want to delete and reset this information, you need to turn both Siri and voice dictation on and off again - open Settings then tap Siri to find the first option, then open Settings and tap General then Keyboard to find the second. ¬© Provided by Future Publishing Ltd.Siri and Spotlight also track your search history so they can have a better idea of what you might want to look for next, but again this is linked to your device rather than you personally. To stop this tracking, go to Settings and choose General then Spotlight Search. You can block this kind of behaviour in Apple's mobile web browser as well by choosing Safari from the Settings app. As on Android, location tracking is a big one as far as your iPhone goes: tap Privacy in Settings then Location Services to change which apps can monitor where you are or to switch it off completely for your device. Meanwhile you can stop activity tracking in Apple Health from the Motion & Fitness menu, also under Privacy. There's also the issue of Google apps on your iOS device‚Äîthey're not as tightly integrated as they are on Android, but they're still collecting data on you. If you've got the Google app for iOS installed, open it up, tap your avatar, then tap Privacy to change what Google is tracking (you should also look at individual settings for apps like Google Maps and Google Chrome as well). Apps Of course beyond the features built into Android and iOS, individual apps you install are collecting data on you and monitoring your activities. We don't have time to go through them all one-by-one here, but we can talk about some general settings to check. To see the permissions that apps have asked for and been given on your phone, open up Settings then scroll down and tap the app name (iOS) or choose Apps, then tap the app name, then tap Permissions (Android). ¬© Provided by Future Publishing Ltd. These permissions can be revoked at any time, though the apps in question might not work so well afterwards (try checking into somewhere on Facebook without location tracking enabled, for example). Another option is to simply uninstall the app if you're not happy about the data it's collecting. If you have any more qualms about the data individual apps are collecting on you, then head to the terms and conditions for a read through. Some of these apps will be collecting data on you from the web as well, so it might not just be your phone you need to consider. As with Apple and Google services in general, you typically can't use apps like Snapchat or Facebook if you don't agree to the way they collect data on you and use it to target advertising. Nevertheless it's always important to be aware of what you're sharing, even while you make use of these apps.

Galaxy S8 and S8+ review: Another pair of excellent mainstream smartphones from Samsung David Ruddock Follow View All Posts 2017/04/18 7:59am PDTApr 18, 2017 21 Plus 1 on G+ 107 Share on Facebook 76 Share on Twitter Total Shares204 Galaxy S8 Galaxy S8+ News Phone Reviews Article Contents 1 The Good 2 The Not So Good 3 Design and materials 4 Display 5 Battery life and charging 6 Storage, wireless, and call quality 7 Audio and speakers 8 Camera 9 Performance 10 Testing notes 11 Software 11.1 What's new 11.1.1 Navigation keys 11.1.2 Bixby 11.1.3 Snap window 11.1.4 Dual audio 11.1.5 Separate app sound 11.1.6 Other changes 11.2 General UI (launcher, notifications, lockscreen, navigation keys) 11.3 Software: Opinion 12 Value 13 Conclusion When you talk about Samsung's Galaxy smartphones, it's hard not to talk about 'the average consumer.' Because the Galaxy S series is the second-most popular line of smartphones on earth, its audience is unashamedly mainstream, and the vast majority of sales of these devices will be to consumers who aren't what you'd call tech-savvy. The issue for Samsung, increasingly, is learning how to split the difference between a smartphone that provides a good experience for everybody and maintaining that all important credibility with its fans and enthusiasts. The Galaxy S8 and S8+, for example, have Quad HD displays - the best ones I've ever seen. But they're set to 1080p by default for improved performance. And as enthusiasts clamor for ever-larger batteries, Samsung has put very average, if not exactly small, ones in these new phones (though they should degrade less noticeably). The S8 is still a slippery metal and glass sandwich that essentially requires additional protection unless you like to live life on the edge, which is great news for case manufacturers, but less so for you and me. And then there's the new fingerprint scanner, which is just a bit tragic (especially on the S8+). Of course, there are big upsides: the latest chipset from Qualcomm, the Snapdragon 835, ensures that the Galaxy S8 will probably have the best LTE performance of any phone on the market here in the US. That chip also brings features like Bluetooth 5.0, improved Wi-Fi performance, and better image signal processors for the cameras. Samsung's Infinity Display is genuinely breathtaking: this is the best screen I've seen on a smartphone, period. The rear-facing camera is still great, the quality of the phone itself seems almost unimpeachable, and Samsung continues to make legitimate value-adds to the smartphone experience with features like Samsung Pay, wireless charging, and advanced network feature support across all four major US carriers. The fact that you can just walk in to a store and buy one generally speaking (ahem, Google) is something worth pointing out, too. Samsung's ubiquity is absolutely a product feature. Like the S7 and S7 edge last year, the S8 and S8+ feel iterative - in a good way. But I also believe they're evidence that what makes a smartphone "great" is becoming more and more subjective. These are great smartphones, but how great really depends a lot on your priorities. The Good Display The best displays I've ever seen on a smartphone. They're bright, they're beautiful, they have excellent viewing angles, and tiny little bezels. You get a ton of screen in a remarkably compact package. Battery I only tested the S8+ in depth, but the battery life on this phone was great. If you disable the always-on display, it gets even better. Camera While I still prefer the Pixel's camera, the S8's has its own strengths, including excellent low-light performance, fast captures, and bright, vivid colors. GraceUX isn't bad TouchWiz has come a long way. Setting aside the conversation about updates, I find GraceUX perfectly good, and Samsung has genuine value-adds in the software these days. Virtual keys FINALLY. Samsung has entered the modern Android era and given us virtual navigation keys. It has noticeably improved my feelings about using a Samsung phone. The Not So Good Fingerprint scanner I actively hate the fingerprint scanner on the S8+. It may be better on the standard S8. But yeah, it's bad. Updates The S8 and S8+ ship with Android 7.0, and I've seen exactly nothing from Samsung indicating they plan to change their attitude about timely Android platform updates. Bixby Is utterly worthless. A waste of a perfectly good hardware key. So much glass I would seriously worry about breaking this phone if I bought it. There is so much glass - Samsung phones essentially require cases. Pricey At $750 and $850 for the S8 and S8+, respectively, there's no denying Samsung is asking a lot for the privilege of joining the Galaxy S club this year. Design and materials Not all glass and metal sandwiches are created equal. With the S8 and S8+, Samsung has proven once again that, yes, there is still room for refinement when it comes to packaging and polishing a smartphone. To call these phones "pretty" would be to do them a disservice (I also don't necessarily think it's true). They have an almost precious quality to them, something that tends to be strongly evoked when you hold them in the slightly awkward "claw" grip a curved-edge smartphone sort of requires. But the phones look and feel so solid - their seams so uniform and tight - that you get the sense they can't even be taken apart, because they must have been forged whole in some kind of dark ritual (especially in this black finish). I don't mean to fawn, but when you compare Samsung's industrial design here on the S8+ to something like the Google Pixel XL, the Pixel looks and feels like yesterday's smartphone. And I don't just mean the bezels. Compare it to the Galaxy S7 edge, and the new S8+ is clearly a more moderate step forward, though. The biggest change is of course the display, which we will get to soon, but let's talk about those bezels. Samsung hasn't made what you'd call a "bezelless" phone (no one has), but their bezel reduction approach is more similar to LG's than, say, Xiaomi's. Instead of making the ludicrous compromise of moving the front-facing camera and various sensors down to the chin of the phone and messing with the earpiece speaker just to achieve that not-bezelless look, Samsung's chopped off some bezel on both the top and bottom. The result is much more screen in a package that doesn't need to grow dramatically to accommodate it. This is the smart approach to maximizing screen-to-body ratio (conversely, I would argue the Xiaomi approach is not smart). The one compromise Samsung had to make was the home button - it was time for it to go. We'll talk more about the software keys later, but for those of you who liked to tap the home key to quickly check your notifications, be at ease: it has a replacement. The pressure-sensitive, always-on virtual home key can be configured to wake the screen on a double tap or long press for quick glances. As you know, this also means the fingerprint scanner had to be put... somewhere else. Samsung hasn't chosen well. The fingerprint scanner on the Galaxy S8+, in particular, is nothing short of a bad experience. My success rate on reads hovers around 50% at the time of this writing, and it's become a frustration so constant that I've started to feel a bit annoyed by the whole thing. Why couldn't it have gone in a more natural, isolated location below the camera sensor? It's not just the reach - the scanner itself is incredibly finicky about making sure the whole sensor area is covered, and sometimes just doesn't recognize my finger is on it at all. This is not to mention that said scanner is right next to the camera, which has the same sort of raised edge design as the scanner and feels exactly the same to your finger. Unlocking the S8+ with your right hand requires immense discipline and active attention to how you grasp the phone. It isn't even worth the trouble (my fingers are pretty long, by the way). With your left, it's doable as you build up the muscle memory instead of having to actively feel out the scanner. But I use a lot of phones, and this is hands down the worst fingerprint scanner I have used since Samsung's old swipe-to-read ones. It boggles my mind how far backward Samsung has gone with this experience. Even the registration process is annoying: it refused to read any of my attempts to register the sides and edges of my finger because the scanner wasn't completely covered. Anyway, that's my fingerprint scanner rant. Samsung, you messed this up. On the bottom of the phone you'll find the 3.5mm headphone jack, a USB 3.0 Type C port, the microphone, and the outlet for the speaker. The design of the power key is unchanged, but Samsung has switched back to a rocker for the volume key to avoid confusion with the new Bixby button. The buttons all provide good feedback and have a nice, clicky feel. I will say the volume rocker is a bit high up on the S8+, presumably in order to make room for said Bixby key. Out back, the camera hump is gone, meaning you can tap away at the S8 sitting on a flat surface and it won't rock or wobble (at least, not significantly). To the right of the sensor is the fingerprint scanner, and to the left is the flash and Samsung's weirdly persistent heart-rate monitor. On the front, things have become substantially more subdued with this generation of phone. The earpiece speaker is much smaller, the Samsung logo is nowhere to be found (a victory, I would say), and there's no chroming or accents around any of the sensors or front-facing camera. All colors of the Galaxy S8 have black bezels around the screen, so no matter which shade you choose, you'll get a pretty stealthy fascia. Undoubtedly, some of you are coming into this review with a question: S8 or S8+? If you're currently using a Galaxy Note5, S6 edge+, or S7 edge, I would actually advise you to consider the S8 over the larger model I'm testing here. The S8+ is a big phone - as tall as a Nexus 6, if not nearly as wide. This will make pocketability a genuine question for some, especially if you're going to be throwing a case on this big, expensive slab of metal and glass. If you typically find yourself liking a 5.5-5.7" smartphone, I'd say go for the regular S8. But if you do want something bigger, the S8+ offers a ton of screen in a package that is a lot easier to handle than phablets (sorry, sorry) of the past. Because all of the extra display area is packaged vertically, the phone is still very narrow and easy to manage with one hand - for most tasks. Reaching the top of the screen can be a real bear, and that can mean risky maneuvers (i.e., potentially dropping it) to access certain parts of the UI one-handed. I still think it's way easier to manipulate than my old Nexus 6, though. The comparative narrowness makes my grip on it a lot more confidence-inspiring, even if those stretches for the notification bar can feel a bit dicey. And because I wasn't sure where else to put it: Yes, the multi-color notification LED is still there. Even with the reduced bezel, Samsung managed to hold on to it. Display If you're sick and tired of hearing every year that "Samsung has done it again - the best smartphone display ever!" then I am sorry, you will continue to be sick and tired. The Galaxy S8 and S8+ have the best smartphone screens. Ever. They get extremely bright, the colors are exceptionally vivid (or accurate, if you switch to the Basic display mode), viewing angles are excellent, blacks are very deep, and the AMOLED panel can get ultra-dim for those late-night reading sessions. Samsung continues to demonstrate that its Super AMOLED technology is the gold standard for displays with the Galaxy S8, and that the bar can still be raised higher yet. I'm always impressed with Samsung's ability to iterate this technology with such consistent success. While this is a Quad HD panel with a native resolution of 2960x1440 (that's a lot of pixels), Samsung configures the S8 and S8+ out of the box to run at 1080p (2220x1080). Why? Because it improves performance. And that feels like something of a copout, doesn't it? Google can run the Pixel XL with its older, less efficient Snapdragon 821 chip at full QHD resolution and achieve performance and battery life that go toe-to-toe with a fresh-out-of-the-box Galaxy S8+. So, why make the phones QHD at all? VR! At least, that's a convenient scapegoat. Notably, you can change the resolution manually to the full QHD. I'll have a few more words about this in the performance section of the review, so stay tuned. Getting back to the screen, I found it worked well even in direct sunlight, with Samsung's ultra-high contrast overboost mode kicking in to maximize readability even in the most challenging conditions. Sure, that'll drain your battery real fast, but it's better than not being able to see your phone. The Galaxy S8s also have support for HDR video, but I believe it's only the HDR10 standard (not Dolby Vision). As far as I know, this will work with select apps that are specifically optimized for Samsung devices, so I would expect adoption of this in a wide way will be fairly slow for the time being outside the core video services like Netflix and Amazon. Still, it's good to have, because the screens on these phones really do deserve HDR video to fully take advantage of their impressive capabilities - especially those positively inky black levels. I applaud Samsung for continuing to include its helpful screen mode setting, which allows you to choose one of four color profile presets depending on how you want the screen to look. The "basic" mode offers the most unforgivingly accurate reproduction of colors, something I find helpful when reviewing photos. Finally, let's talk about the edge. Last year, I was pretty clear on my feelings about the Galaxy S7 edge having issues properly rejecting fingers or palms at the edge of the display. Because of the way curved-edge displays are shaped and the fact that Samsung curves both the front and the back of the device, it's essentially impossible to hold a curved-edge phone without your fingers or palms touching the edge of the screen. On the S7 edge, this was absolutely maddening at times. It made the phone nearly impossible for me to use if I was lying on my back, for example, doing some email in bed, and it was one of the reasons I stopped using it so quickly after my review period. I am happy to report that it looks like Samsung has given some serious attention to the issue of edge rejection. I tapped out a full email on the S8+ lying back on the couch and didn't get a single misread character or failure to respond to input. I browsed the web, scrolled through Twitter, did some texting, and it all went off without a hitch. That's cause for a sigh of relief - I was really worried Samsung would just continue to act like this issue didn't exist. Battery life and charging I've only been using the Galaxy S8+, so that's the phone I can give you battery life impressions on. My take so far is that battery life is at least as good as the Snapdragon Galaxy S7 edge from last year, a phone that offered above-average performance in this area. In single-day heavy use, the phone could reliably get 5 hours of screen time, sometimes creeping closer to 6 hours. That's very good - exceeding the Pixel XL in performance, even. Will the Exynos variant once again clean Qualcomm's clock on efficiency? I guess we'll have to see how they compare in reviews around the web. Still, the S8+ does really well here, and if you want the version of the phone that's going to be able to power you through the most usage possible, that extra 500mAh of capacity (3500mAh total for the S8+) over the standard S8 isn't anything to sneeze at - and I doubt the larger display cannibalizes all of it. Samsung has also claimed that these batteries should hold up better over the long haul than those in last year's phones, saying that the S8 and S8+ will retain 95% of their effective capacity after a full year of typical usage (the S7 retained just 80%). That's welcome news, because as we all know, battery life doesn't tend to get better as a phone ages. The idle drain on the S8+ wasn't particularly great in my experience, but that's because I had the always-on display enabled. Samsung estimated on the S7 that you'd drain under 1% of your battery per hour with the feature turned on, so I think those of you really looking to get every bit of battery bang for your buck possible will want to turn this off. It does have an effect. I also turned off Samsung's very annoying app "sleep" feature, which looks at apps that are using power in the background but that you don't use regularly and then forces them into an "sleep" state to prevent them from waking the phone. It's well-intentioned, I know, but if I want something like that, I tend to trust Greenify, and honestly, I'm generally OK with letting Android's Doze do its work. Finally, just as a note: all of my testing was done in the standard 1080p mode the phone ships in - I've not turned up the resolution to full QHD. Obviously, if you do this, your battery life will suffer as a result of the increased number of pixels which need to be rendered (apparently not - it's just performance). However, I really can't be sure just how big an effect this will have, and it's not a particularly easy thing to test outside of a highly controlled environment. Charging the S8 and S8+ is just the same as it's been for years with the Galaxy line of phones, using Samsung's Adaptive Fast Charge technology based on Qualcomm Quick Charge 2.0. The one change comes in the port, which is now a USB-C connector. Oh, and Samsung has made the charging bricks and cables black now, instead of white. It charges at the same speed all Samsung phones with Adaptive Fast Charge have over the years, and the charger still has a Type A USB port. Samsung says the retention of the older charging tech and Type A port is to make transitioning from legacy products easier for their customers, and it looks like the S8 will even include a microUSB to type C adapter tip in the box. When you sell as many smartphones to "normals" as Samsung, these are very valid considerations, and so while enthusiasts might be a bit miffed than Qualcomm Quick Charge 4.0 and USB Power Delivery aren't in tow here, it's not like the phones charge slowly. Samsung also still includes wireless charging, and it is releasing a new wireless fast charging pad which provides the same speed as the fast charging pad for the S7 did last year. This year, the pad has a rubbery, leather-texture surface and pops up to act as a phone stand, which is kind of cool. Wireless charging is available on all Galaxy S8 models, too - no worrying about regional variants here. Storage, wireless, and call quality The Galaxy S8 and S8+ come with as much storage as you'd like - as long as it's 64GB. There's only one storage tier being offered in the US (I wouldn't be surprised if China gets a 128GB model), but you can expand that with a microSD card. I really will hand it to Samsung for upping their base offering to 64GB - 32GB just doesn't cut it these days, and 128GB can seem a bit overkill. This T-Mobile variant I tested came with 53GB of that available to the user out of the box, which should be more than enough for most of us. Wireless performance on the phone has been excellent for me. Data speeds on T-Mobile have been great, and the Galaxy S8 and S8+ support a large number of advanced network technologies here in the US to ensure you're getting the most possible out of your carrier's network. Be it advanced LTE carrier aggregation, wireless MIMO, VoLTE, HD Voice, Wi-Fi calling, LTE-U - it's all here. You can thank Qualcomm's X16 LTE modem for most of this. A lot of things can be said of Samsung, but they rarely ever miss out on a chance to be a showcase for the carriers' newest features. T-Mobile, for example, says the S8 and S8+ will be the fastest-ever smartphones on its network thanks to 4x4 MIMO, carrier aggregation, and 256 QAM support. Wi-Fi performance on the S8+ has been great for me, and Bluetooth in my car has been flawless, providing strong reception and zero pairing issues (something that can't be said of certain phones starting with "P"). I've come to expect Samsung to get Bluetooth right over the years, and they still are. Bluetooth 5.0 support is on board courtesy of the Snapdragon 835 chipset, but no real consumer devices out there using the standard exist yet. But you can take advantage of some of the standard's increased power right now - for example, Samsung has introduced a new feature called dual audio that lets you stream to two pairs of Bluetooth headphones at once. That's pretty awesome. Audio and speakers The Snapdragon 835 features a newer revision of Qualcomm's Aqstic audio "codec" (basically, the DAC and headphone amplifier), and I do think some noticeable gains have been made here. For one, I feel output on the headphone jack is better - driving big, high-impedance headphones left me with more room on the volume slider than attempting to play the same tracks with my Pixel XL. I also might be hearing some improved bass response, but that could just be the extra "oomf" the new amplifier is providing. Quality itself is still excellent, and I really noticed no difference on that front between the 821 and 835. Annoyingly, Samsung's volume warning still won't let you exceed a certain threshold until you accept a warning dialogue saying you might blow out your ears. It is very annoying. I realize there are laws on the books about this in Europe, but why does this have to be in the firmware for every variant of the phone, and why does it have to tell you every time you plug in a set of headphones? That's certainly not the case with Apple or Google's phones here, but Samsung seems dogged in its resistance to this regional accommodation. Samsung doesn't seem to have really done much with its external speaker. It sounds decent, but the direction it fires and the peak output leave a fair bit to be desired. In the age of waterproofed smartphones with itty-bitty bezels, it's hard to see speakers being a major priority anymore. It's sad, but it's true. Camera I was a fan of the camera on the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge, though I do still have my critiques as they've aged: colors are exaggerated and processing can be overbearing. Samsung claims that while the camera in the S8 and S8+ is the same one found in last year's phones, they've done work on the processing side to increase image quality. What does that mean, exactly? For my eyeballs, it means less aggressive sharpening. As with last year's phones, the S8 is an incredibly capable camera in low light conditions. The f/1.7 lens hoovers up a surprising amount of light even in challenging conditions, and with a steady hand you can get some pretty crisp shots where other phones would just render an unpleasing mess of noise and blur. Even Google's Pixel is no match for the S7 in low light - the dual-pixel autofocus and aforementioned lens make a formidable duo in the dark. Photos shoot off fast and the camera launches quickly, though I had honestly hoped for some improvement in speed given the new Spectra ISP the Snapdragon 835 features. In fact, the Galaxy S8's camera still doesn't launch as consistently quickly as my Pixel XL's, especially when using the quick launch feature, where the Pixel XL is very noticeably faster on the draw. That's... not great. It's still quick to start up, but you'd think Samsung would be focusing on this kind of stuff in terms of trying to be the best. Previous Next When we get to the actual business of the photos, I think nearly everyone who buys this phone will be incredibly happy with how their snapshots turn out. They're vivid, crisp, and as I said, the results in challenging light are still as impressive today as they were last year. I definitely approve of Samsung's reduction in the amount of sharpening applied to photos - things just look more natural now. The colors are still a bit unrealistic at times, and Samsung's automatic HDR is nowhere near as impressive as Google's HDR+, meaning you'll still get blowouts in particularly high-contrast scenarios. But the camera is good. In terms of the app experience, Samsung has added Snapchat-like overlays and stickers (for joy), but aside from a new option to place a floating shutter button on the UI, the camera app is essentially unchanged from how it appears on the Galaxy S7's current Nougat build with Grace UX. That means you get a Pro mode with a few more shooting options (including RAW output), filters, slow motion, panorama, hyperlapse, and more. All in all, the camera experience on the S8 hasn't really changed much this year, and while I wouldn't call that a letdown, per se, I don't think Samsung had the best smartphone camera last year overall, and leaving it essentially unchanged for 2017 means it probably won't this year, either. Performance The version of the Galaxy S8+ I'm testing uses Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835 chipset, not the Samsung Exynos chip that many other markets around the world will get. If you want to know about the 835's capabilities on paper, we have an extensive post benchmarking its performance. In the real world, the Galaxy S8 and S8+ are the very first smartphones to utilize Qualcomm's new chip. How's that gone? Well, I am happy to report that the Galaxy S8+ I'm testing is very noticeably faster than an S7 edge with a fairly fresh Nougat install. It's a pretty stark difference. Has Samsung conquered the infamous lag its devices develop over longer periods of time? I can't answer that today, obviously, and Samsung really isn't interested in discussing it, either. As more reviewers and eventually consumers spend more time with the phone, we'll be able to better assess that issue. That said, out of the box, the Galaxy S8+ feels almost as quick as my Google Pixel XL. A little faster in some scenarios, too, but I would say the two phones offer reasonably comparable performance based on the week I had to really compare the two. The Pixel XL isn't what I'd call the fastest Android phone for raw speed (I'd say the OnePlus 3T wins there), but it's the consistency of its performance that has really impressed me in the last six months. If Samsung can keep even close to this level of performance on the Galaxy S8 six months from now, that'd be a huge boost for the user experience on its phones. That is, unless you really heat up the S8+. Between benchmark testing runs, I noticed the phone developed the very typical kind of lag I'd found on devices like the Galaxy S7 edge last year. The Pixel doesn't do this. The OnePlus 3T doesn't do this. Why are Samsung phones so aggressively throttling under thermal load? Still, the number of times I worked the phone hard enough in regular use for this to be an issue were negligible - as in, it really didn't happen at all outside the back-to-back benchmarking scenario. One performance asterisk I'd like to point out is that the Galaxy S8 and S8+ do give themselves something of an edge on phones like the G6 and Pixel XL inherently, because they run at 1080p resolution out of the box instead of the 1440p every other QHD phone does, but you really can't tell the difference 95% of the time. On the whole, I'm satisfied with how this phone performs. During the hands-on event, I was much more tepid, as I just didn't have the time to really get a feel, especially comparatively, for the overall smoothness and consistency of the experience. There are, however, some areas where I think Samsung could improve. The way the notification shade draws down feels a bit clunky (not slow, just weird), and sometimes the virtual navigation keys have a split-second delay on interaction. It's also definitely a bit easier to choke up the S8+ with manic opening and closing of apps than the Pixel XL - it does start to get a little overwhelmed when you really, really push it. I also think Google is doing a better job on touch latency, as sometimes the S8+ feels just a bit behind my fingers. As for benchmarks, you probably won't be surprised to learn Samsung's implementation of the Snapdragon 835 isn't as fast as Qualcomm's reference device. I've pasted a results table for popular tests below.

Instead I'm going to devote this section to brief thoughts I've had when using the phone - specific, relatively concise observations about what the Galaxy S8+ is like to use. The fingerprint scanner is too hard to reach on the S8+, misreads are common. You may smudge the camera lens when reaching for the scanner, meaning blurry photos if you're not an obsessive lens wiper like me. I tried to use the iris scanner, but it was even worse than the fingerprint sensor with my glasses, my hit rate was well under 20%. Unlike with the Pixel, Bluetooth performance in my car ('16 Mazda) was great - I didn't even need to take the phone out of my pocket. The S8+ is fairly easy to keep a grip on width-wise, but it is very tall, and pulling down on the notification bar one-handed just feels risky. The top area of my homescreen is basically a no man's land for the same reason. I can't say I actually care the phone renders in 1080p by default, you can't really tell. I didn't end up using the always-on home button feature at all, even though it is kind of neat. If I bought this phone, I'd turn off always-on display to keep the idle battery drain lower. While not the newest or fastest standard, Samsung's 15 watt fast charging still tops up the phone pretty quickly in my experience. On the launcher, the Samsung Pay quick-access peeking thing reduces the size of the touch targets for the nav keys. I switched the navigation key order to the traditional Android layout (back, home, recent apps) and haven't looked back. Samsung's new launcher looks alright but I went straight to Nova, in part to get my round icons back (yes, I have been Pixel indoctrinated). I don't know how anyone lives with the stock Samsung keyboard. Yikes. Even with all this extra vertical space, I still can't find a single compelling reason to split-screen apps on Android. Samsung still isn't allowing "OK Google" hotword recognition when the display is off (probably because Bixby). Software For the purpose of this review, much of my definition of "new" is going to rely on what is new versus a Galaxy S7 running Samsung's GraceUX update on Android 7.0. So with that in mind, let's get to it. What's new Navigation keys The biggest change, of course, is down at the bottom of the screen: virtual navigation keys! I'm not going to get caught up on how they look - I just care that they're there and they work. And you can change them to the proper back-home-recents order, which I did immediately upon setting up the phone. Choice feels good. You can also change the background color for the navbar if you're so inclined. The home button has a few extra tricks up its sleeve, too. It's always on - even if the always-on display mode is off and your screen isn't illuminated, there's a pressure sensitive area where the home button displays. Just press with some force (the amount of force can be adjusted in settings), and your phone will wake up just like you'd pressed a physical home button. You can see why rumors are swirling that Samsung wanted to integrate a fingerprint scanner with this feature - it would make complete sense. The home key will also respond to hard presses even when an app is overlaying the navbar. Honestly, I didn't end up using the hard press feature pretty much ever. You can also set it up to just display the lockscreen on a double-tap of the button. (Which is fine, but seems an inferior solution to tapping anywhere on the display to do a wake as LG, HTC, and other phones do.) Bixby *cracks knuckles.* OK, let's talk about Samsung's intelligent assistant... thing. Bixby exists in three incarnations on the Galaxy S8 at this time. First, there is Bixby Home (Google Now). Then, there is Bixby Reminders (which is, well, reminders). And then we have Bixby Vision (Google Goggles). We'll talk about each of them, I guess. Bixby's banner feature, voice controls, is not available at the time of this review, and will supposedly launch here in the US later this spring. For now, then, all the Bixby button does is launch Bixby Home. ¬†¬† Bixby Home is the most involved of the three, so let's begin there. Bixby Home is a bit like someone took your Google Now feed and made it less useful. It displays recent photos you've taken, advertises themes on Samsung's Galaxy Apps store, suggests wallpapers, gives you unnecessarily large calendar event cards, displays random GIFs from giphy (why), gives you a list of your most frequently visited websites (if you use Samsung's browser), as well as your most frequently used apps. There's also weather, your step count (helpful), and news served from Flipboard (which you can remove entirely). Currently, Bixby home integrates with a few third-party apps, too. Spotify, Twitter, Uber, Giphy, Facebook, CNN, and Foursquare all can pipe in data to the Bixby Home app if they're installed on your device. Of note: Bixby Home by default can run from your lockscreen, though Samsung does disable cards that might contain personally identifying information like your contacts or calendar. Bixby Home does look kind of nice, so there's that, but I just don't see anybody using this. Google Now is helpful for the deep insights it has about your habits and interests based on the fact that Google knows an insanely creepy amount about what you do on the internet. Samsung will probably never be able to get that deep. Then, we've got Bixby Reminders. Bixby Reminders is exactly what it sounds like: you can set a reminder to do something, including based on a time or location. There are roughly, I don't know, a billion apps and services out there that do this much more robustly and with far more powerful features. I don't see any reason to care about Bixby Reminders unless you're a big fan of Bixby Home, which is where you will be able to find said Bixby Reminders. Finally, there's Bixby Vision. You use it by opening the camera app and pressing the Bixby Vision button. Right now, Bixby Vision can identify wine. I tried a bottle, it didn't work. Bixby Vision can also identify text for translation. That's kind of nice. Bixby Vision can identify objects. I showed it a Galaxy S7. It gave me results for iPads. And it can read QR codes, because it's 2017 and we're still using those. So, yes, it really is just Google Goggles but kind of different (and worse?). You can probably safely ignore Bixby for now, but maybe voice commands will make it actually somewhat useful when they do arrive. Try not to hit the button accidentally, though - I'm doing it all the time and it's getting kind of annoying. Snap window Snap windows is an interesting attempt by Samsung to make Android's splitscreen functionality suck less when you're using it to watch video. Let's say you're watching something in YouTube but you also want to keep texting someone without interrupting your video. You could use Android's built-in splitscreening to do this, but every time you pop out the keyboard in the chat app, your video is going to get pushed around and interrupted and reload constantly. It's a bad experience, and kind of shows just what a sorry state multitasking really still is in on the platform. ¬†¬† Snap window is a band-aid, of sorts, on that problem. With your video player open and the video in view (in portrait mode), open the multitasking UI and the card for the video app should have a third icon to the left of the splitscreen button. Hit that, and you're given a crop interface. Move the rectangle over the area where the video is playing, adjust the size if necessary, and hit "done." At this point, the video will "pin" to the top of the screen, and the lower part of the interface becomes the app switcher. Pick an app, and you're off and running - the video won't move at all even if you pop out the keyboard, and plays back smoothly. I have no idea how this really works, but Samsung clearly understood that video was a pain point in the Android splitscreen experience, and this makes it much better. I can't say I'll use it, but given all that vertical screen space on the S8+, I'm sure someone wants to know about this. Snap window works with any app, of course, but video is the most obvious application. Dual audio Thanks to Bluetooth 5.0, the Galaxy S8 can transmit the same audio to two pairs of Bluetooth audio devices at once. This could be great for watching movies or listening to music on a plane together, for example. I tested it, and it works. Samsung does note that because you only get one volume slider to adjust on the phone, the output level to each connected Bluetooth device will probably vary, and you'll need to adjust the device volume for individual control. Still, it's pretty cool. Separate app sound This is another one I found digging around in Samsung's labyrinthine settings menu: a new feature called separate app sound. I know, this sounds boring, but hold on - it may actually solve a problem that's been bugging you for years. Streaming music over Bluetooth is convenient, but it does tend to come with a catch: your device can't play any other media audio when you're streaming music, because that'll pause the player app. So if you want to play a game or watch a video silently on your phone while you're streaming tunes to a Bluetooth speaker or headphones, you can't - there's only one media channel. This fixes that. Once separate app sound is enabled, you can select one app and make it the exclusive media audio provider to a connected Bluetooth device. So, if you want to make sure Play Music is coming through your Bluetooth speaker, pick the Play Music app and select the Bluetooth device, and only that app will be allowed to send media audio to that speaker while this setting is enabled. (Notification audio, unfortunately, is not blocked - that will still come through.) But, now you can open up YouTube, a game, or browse the web on your phone while Play Music is going without worrying about pausing your Bluetooth stream, as all other media audio will play directly through the device speaker instead. This is a pretty decent idea. Other changes I've got some smaller features and changes I discovered, and I'll list them out here. Fingerprint scanner can be set to pull down the notification shade and, from the home screen, to launch Samsung Pay by swiping up. Face unlock mode. Always-on display mode has some very slight aesthetic tweaks. That's really it. The software changes versus the current GraceUX OS on the GS7 and S7 edge are pretty minor. General UI (launcher, notifications, lockscreen, navigation keys) The notification tray is essentially unchanged from the current version of Samsung's skin running on a Galaxy S7, though the launcher is an all-new version of TouchWiz Home that uses a swipe-up (or down, actually) app drawer a la Pixel. Samsung has also implemented some kind of ape on launcher shortcuts, but they're not really launcher shortcuts - they're just a bunch of actions you can take on the icon. For example, you can multi-select icons in the launcher, remove a shortcut, sleep an app, uninstall it, or go to the info screen. It's kind of handy, really, but I'm not sure it could easily coexist with Android's app shortcuts - the list of items would get really long. In lieu of Google Now, the TouchWiz launcher has a pane for Bixby home to the left of the first homescreen. Yay. ¬†¬† Like me, you're probably going to toss off that stock launcher almost immediately, so I won't dive in too deep. It seems like a fine launcher as OEM launchers go, but if you want any kind of customization, you've still got to go third party. The recent apps menu is the same as you'll find on any up to date S7, and the lockscreen has seen a slight visual refresh, though still offers the same shortcuts for the dialer, Samsung Pay, and the camera app. Of note: Samsung takes a more conservative approach with whether or not it will stretch apps into "full-screen" mode on this new, longer display. There's an area in the settings menu where you can force toggle apps to display in the full UI space, as I've noticed many, even some Google apps, are not set to by default. I forced this on for all my apps and haven't had any issues, but your mileage may vary. Software: Opinion I really don't mind GraceUX. Samsung doesn't mess with stock Android too much these days from a strictly functional perspective. I don't like that I have to disable some things like Samsung's app sleeping, touch sounds, or navigation button order - but here's the thing: I can. There are very few things which I cannot change about the software experience on the Galaxy S8 that are genuine annoyances. Don't like the launcher? Throw on a new one. Don't care for Bixby? Ignore it. Almost every potential software negative on this phone is either easily replaced or simply kept out of sight and out of mind. ¬†¬† Throw on your own launcher, set up Samsung Pay, and try to ignore that you'll probably be seeing "7.0" on this screen for a while - that's my advice. Meanwhile, Samsung adds genuinely useful features like Samsung Pay, screen modes, its dual audio Bluetooth feature, game modes, fingerprint scanner gestures, face recognition, a system-level audio EQ, tons of various configuration options, and more all packaged in what is probably the most technologically advanced smartphone on sale right now. That's not small potatoes. The one sticking point for me, though, is the Android version. The Galaxy S8 ships with Android 7.0, already a version and change behind. Samsung seems to have no interest in changing its approach to platform updates, and that's disappointing. I guess we'll see how they handle things with the S8 and S8+, but I don't have my hopes up. Additionally, while performance is decent out of the gate, I really think we should be demanding more. "Almost as good as the Pixel" is not huge praise considering this phone runs a next-generation chipset and renders the OS at a fraction the resolution a Pixel does. These aren't small concerns for the enthusiast set, but I don't think they're at all fatal to the phones. They're just worth considering. Value In essence, the Galaxy S8 and S8+ retail for $750 and $850, respectively, here in the US. That's a chunk of change more than an LG G6, though that phone does only come with 32GB of storage and features an older chipset. I think that considering the advanced display, processor, and level of quality Samsung is delivering, the prices are totally justifiable. Now, that doesn't mean they're not expensive phones - they are. Really, really expensive phones. But the standard S8 to me is more the competitor to the G6 and Pixel XL, while the S8+ sort of stands on its own as a direct challenge to the iPhone 7 Plus. Many people may not find the size of the S8+ very practical - it really is quite tall. Samsung phones also mean a glut of accessory choices for things like cases, full compatibility with any US carrier (including advanced network features), and more attention from 3rd-party developers in terms of ensuring apps run as they should. These aren't trivial things, even if they may not often go into the traditional smartphone value assessment. Is there nearly $300 more hardware in a Galaxy S8 than a OnePlus 3T? Of course not. But that's not really the question anyone is seriously asking. I think Samsung is charging a pretty penny for the S8 and S8+, but I also think they're doing more to convince the average consumer than, say, Google, that the price of admission is actually worth it. Conclusion The Galaxy S8 and S8+ are great smartphones, I have no doubt of this. Are they great smartphones for everyone? That's a question that, as an Android enthusiast myself, I have a harder time sounding decisive answering. I really like the Infinity Display. I like the very good battery life. I don't mind GraceUX - it's fine! I like the cameras, I like the quality of the phone itself, and I like the new software navigation keys. I have a harder time accepting the update situation and the already-slightly-shaky performance. These things give me genuine pause. But if they don't concern you - and they may well not - it's hard to find truly major faults with these phones. Samsung has done an excellent job building upon and refining the formula that it... built upon and refined with the S7 and S7 edge. The S8+ is probably a little big for most people, but I like that Samsung is offering a "real" big phone in its mainstream lineup. And if you don't want a "big" phone, the standard S8 really is very manageable. Samsung has built two excellent smartphones with the S8 and S8+. We're awarding both the S8 and S8+ our editor's choice "Most Wanted" accolade as well. Whether or not that gets you excited really comes down to what you value in a phone. For me? I'm still pretty happy with my Pixel XL. But if I was shopping today, I'd give the S8, or the S8+, a long, hard look. Tags galaxy 8 review galaxy s8 review subscribe ...

Marty Just for interest since you used Geekbench, my Honor 8 got this score. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4b179b912ffc406ee06b6dff18a2017929f27362c4f2d6b7945c1341904cf980.png Mark Whelan my Mate 9 scored 1859 single core 6474 multi-core I still think the battery life is going to be just average on these new Samsung phones on the Snapdragon chipset...I get a solid 36 hours out of my phone with 8 hrs screen time. S8+ will get 5 hours most likely on a 15 hr day...and badly needing the charger.... What's the point of a QHD screen if you ship it running 1080p? Marty My opinion is that Huawei's going to displace Samsung as the top Android OEM since they are making such good phones. iKon Agreed, Huawei are slowly climbing up, they already in top 3 and it won't take long to get past apple. Anon probably in just a year or 2 to overtake Apple. It will still take quite a while to displace Samsung. 4 years? Marty If Sammy keeps languishing with their mobile division, it won't take 4 years. Samsung's software, while brimming with features, just isn't good. The only software Sammy has put out that's above and beyond anything else in its class is an app: Samsung Internet Beta. Dubs816 lmaoooooo dickchao Yeah these guys are delusional lol Marty By the way, the resolution is selectable. I'm pretty sure the S8 wouldn't be locked to FHD. Steve McQueen Love my Mate 9. Getting 8-9 hours of SOT is pretty nice. And I love not having to worry about battery life even during a 20 hour day. Stu Would you recommend this phone? I'm thinking of grabbing it the next time it's on sale. Marty Absolutely. It's one of the best phones I've ever owned. It's gorgeous, superbly made, feels good in the hand and is probably the fastest phone I've used. The fingerprint scanner is amazingly quick. The phone works so well too. If you don't mind an Android phone more similar to an iPhone, this is it. The system pretty much looks more like an iPhone than any Android. But it doesn't lack features like an iPhone would. My opinion why the Honor 8 hasn't received the fanfare it deserves has to do with religious hatred of Apple and the iPhone by Android enthusiasts. They can be quite irrational. Anything that even hints of iOS is likely to be shunned no matter how good the device is. I got the 64GB blue one and have been smiling since. And get a Spigen case for it if you get one. The Spigen really enhances the beauty of the Honor 8 while protecting it. m477 I like iOS. I really don't like cheap copies of it, and some of the common chinese-OEM software solutions, like a pre-installed, intrusive cleaner. I hate bullshit like that. Marty I wouldn't call EMUI on the Honor 8 a cheap copy of iOS. But it sounds like you have a gripe against the Honor 8. m477 I'm just calling EMUI what it is. It's clearly meant to mimic iOS, and it has some very questionable design choices. I have nothing against Huawei's hardware, I own a P9 lite. Marty Yeah, well I don't see a problem with it. It isn't iOS. It definitely runs quick. Smoothest, fastest Android yet. m477 My problem it's that I find it ugly to look at, compared to other interface, and I really don't like that it tries so hard to mimic iOS. To each their own. Marty Like how Samsung tries so hard to copy the iPhone. But, that's how it goes... Marty You know something? I used to listen to people like you about the Honor 8 before I finally decided to do an impulse buy and get one. Things that people like you say kept me from taking a chance on it. I'm glad I did an impulse buy because it turns out to be one of the best phones I've ever owned. It isn't nearly like what people like you say about it. I've already said that Android enthusiasts raise objection to the Honor 8 for whatever reasons, but the general public will love this device because it is that good. All people have to do is disregard the "Android enthusiast" rhetoric about it and give it a go. D13H4RD2L1V3 EMUI 5 is pretty good. Tried it on a Mate 9 along with its Pro variant and it does zip past screens without effort. Sure, its aesthetics are questionable but it is much improved. m477 Good for you. I'm not an Android enthusiast as much as a tech enthusiast. My daily driver is an iPhone, and I've tried most of the various Android UIs (even ColorOS and MIUI). In my opinion EMUI design wise is one of the most derivative. I don't like the fact that is a copy mostly because it seems to be screaming "I want to be an iPhone but I'm not". It got much better with the fifth version, and it will not get in your way (most of the time, at least). It's obviously still Android under the hood. Most Huawei phones are overall good, but you can't deny that software design is not their forte. A normal user will be fine with that. I personally just don't like copycats. Marty Comparing EMUI to Touchwiz, I'd say Huawei is an expert on software. Meaning EMUI is way better than Samsung's junky software. My Honor 8...the software experience...feels refined and high quality compared to many other Android systems. If anyone wants the truth about it, just give an Honor 8 a try. Update it to EMUI 5/Android 7 and use it daily. It's impressive. This is coming from someone who has a great many phones and has experienced many more. I can list all the phones I've owned and have used and this Honor 8 is the finest of them. m477 The hate on Touchwiz/GraceUX is a little more than a meme right now. Design wise it's not that bad, actually. Every modern, highly specced phone is a good phone (with a few exceptions), and will be "impressive" in daily usage. It's mostly a matter of preference. Marty Heh...so if someone who has a significant number of modern devices sees one of them stand out as impressive, it means nothing? Like you say, "to each, their own". Michaels_28 EMUI = Spyware. I tossed out my Honor 8. It was a good phone for the price I paid ($350 with a promo) but if I had to do it again I would avoid it. Having said that, the reason why Huawei is not selling their affordable phones like hotcakes in the U.S. is not because of irrational hatred. It's because of 1) national security interest, and 2) patents. If you remember the length Apple went after Samsung because of "rectangles with rounded corners," then you should be able to picture the legal barrier Huawei (or anyone really) is facing. Marty If the government was concerned about national security, Obama would never have been president. Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà I like MIUI. It's very iPhoneish. m477 If you can stand EMUI, which is a cheap copy of the iPhone's interface, and some of the crappy software solutions, it's a good phone. Cakefish Galaxy S7 w/Exynos 8890 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/d012918ef89a330af9de9ee732fbd0c60a69cebc2441f666b62a620328a3c72c.png MJ "...already-slightly-shaky performance." LOL Someday Samsung, someday. I really like look of the phone but the fingerprint scanner location (and shape) is really tragic and a no go. Toss3 Pretty sure that's just the 835 slowing things down, as the exynos version I tried was buttery smooth (smoother than my tweaked exynos S7). There are always going to be some slowdowns, but in the case of the S-series most of it can be linked back to the Snapdragon SoCs. David Ruddock Plenty of OEMs make Snapdragon chips run perfectly smooth. It says far more about Samsung than it does Qualcomm. Toss3 Didn't mean to make it sound like there is anything wrong with Snapdragon SoCs; they just aren't a priority over at Samsung and if you want a smooth experience, you need to get the international version. Samsung is definitely to blame, but they do offer an alternative and it's always better to let people know that the Exynos version is the one to get. MJ The international version is not really an option in the US for most people. Warranty, Samsung Pay (that fixed yet?), and some type of payment plan are all big things. ericshmerick No wifi calling, no gogo pass functionality (on T-Mo). likurges who cares about the US? america is falling apart MJ Yeah, it's just horrible here so don't believe anything you hear and certainly don't waste your time immigrating here. likurges believe me, the us is towards the bottom of my list of countries that I'd want to migrate to. and now that you hurt my feeling I'm going to get them checked for free because you know .. single payer healthcare is a thing in the modern world MJ Dude, why do you keep advertising on the Internet how bad it in the US? I wouldn't want my fellow citizens to figure it out also thus ruining your future increases in elbow room in your own country. Worse, you could end up a out terrorist watchlist and then Donald drone strikes your ass. I wouldn't take the chance man! Single payer? Sweet! That's almost worth exchanging for having any real professional sports. I am BLOCKING you now. All bets in on if the troll responds again! likurges dude freedom of speech, have you ever heard of it? blocking people you don't like makes you similar to The Donald whispy_snippet "if you want a smooth experience, you need to get the international version" ...you need to get a different phone all together. MJ What? No... tu3218 Just use google smart Lock. I rarely need to use my fingerprint scanner on my S7 edge because of this. MJ I rarely use my phone at home and don't have a smartwatch so Smart Lock is of limited use to me. The fingerprint scanner is the best option for me and I am not buying the S8 so it doesn't really matter. tu3218 On body detection...this doesn't just apply to the s8. It's any phone. Just in case you were unaware of that feature. I know I always forget about that one. S8 does the best of everything besides the fingerprint scanner. Very easy to look over. m477 Is not easy to look over. Even budget phones have nailed the fingerprint reader. It's unacceptable that it sucks on a flagship. tu3218 I agree. Last minute terrible decision. It helps knowing that. Doesn't make it right though. TBD how bad it is when I get my s8. Smart Lock helps though. Rick Atherton it might just be me but every phone I've used the on body detection the phone always does stuff in my pocket so i always turn it off Drakenoid I use Gravity Screen instead of that, works far better. Scott It sucks they couldn't figure out how to put in under the display as they clearly wished they could. I just hope Apple has the same issue, or Samsung will have some serious egg on their face come iPhone time. MJ While the under the display fingerprint scanner would be cool tech I am not sure about having a permanent fingerprint smudge on my screen. LOL whispy_snippet A fingerprint sensor under the display makes perfect sense. I can't wait until every phone can do it well. MJ A fingerprint sensor under the display would be cool but NOT any more practical (I would argue LESS practical) than a sensor on the back (and less costly to implement). whispy_snippet Having owned a Pixel since launch I'd have to say I disagree. I love my phone. I think the Pixel is such a well rounded experience. But the one area I really think could be better is the fingerprint sensor placement. Sure, it's great when it's in my hand. But it's almost always on a desk in front of me - just like right now. If I want to quickly check something, I need to pick it up to use the fingerprint sensor or leave it on the table and swipe in my pattern. Sucky. If the fingerprint sensor was on the front this issue would be eliminated immediately. I feel like putting fingerprint sensors on the back is just a way of being different to Apple for different's sake - and I guess I can sorta understand this given Apple kicks up such a huge song and dance the moment anyone tries to do anything coming close to their approach. But fuck it. Just put it on the front and fight them I say. MJ A Pixel XL owner since launch myself. The fingerprint sensor is quick and accurate and my finger slides into place naturally. What is there not to like? I never could understand "the phone on the desk argument". Incoming text and call information shows right up on the lock screen. I can just double tab and put in my pin if really need to do interact but I would pick it up and use the fingerprint scanner just like any other time I use my phone. I mostly use my phone when on the go anyway which means it is in my pocket and a rear sensor works much better (and natural) than the front sensor on my former HTC 10 ever did. "I feel like putting fingerprint sensors on the back is just a way of being different to Apple for different's sake...". Huh? No... Again, I would argue a sensor on back just makes more sense and in the case of Google they have always used on-screen buttons so a single fingerprint reader on the front would just look stupid (aka see Moto) and also the Nexus 6P/5X had front facing speakers so the sensor had to go on the back. whispy_snippet The thing is, double tap to wake doesn't work reliably. It works maybe 75% of the time. Not bad, but when it lets you down it grates. In fact the same goes for Google's screen off voice unlock - it works maybe 60% of the time and this REALLY annoys me... but I digress. The fingerprint scanner on the back is great when it's in your hand but annoying when it's on a desk. A fingerprint scanner on the front is good in your hand and good on a desk. Ultimately, I think I'd prefer a consistently good user experience. I think a fingerprint sensor behind the display will be the end goal for every phone maker. In a couple of years I reckon everyone will be doing it. Bryan Breguet Fingerprint sensor on the back makes no sense to me and is an automatic dealbreaker. I truly hate it. Also, really, you don't understand the argument of when the phone is on your desk? Surely you are trolling. MJ I think people who think they can't use their phone because it's sitting on a desk and it has rear fingerprint scanner are trolling. Alejandro You can double tap the screen to read the notifications...No need to unlock the phone with the fingerprint sensor. Bryan Breguet You can double tap to read the notification, not the full email or even picture or whatever. Are you guys really that thick that you are trying to use this argument? You'll ultimately need to unlock the phone and therefore it means you won't use the fingerprint almost half the time. Scott You mean on your touchscreen? MJ Yes. whispy_snippet On the one hand, yes. I expect Apple will get the fingerprint scanner under the display right for their upcoming flagship. On the other hand if Apple comes out with a minimal bezel, curved edge display it's going to be a special moment for Samsung. Finally, Samsung will be able to say outright "You copied US, Apple" and they'll be right. m477 You hope that a competing product has some issue and the advanced technology that everyone want's will not be ready, so Samsung's sells won't be hindered? Do you own Samsung stocks or something? Scott Hell yeah I want the iPhone to faceplant. Liam Bulkley I know the "2.5D" (are they still calling it that?) is, thus far, largely a gimmick, and effectively reduces the reading width due to distortions, but the front of the s8/+ looks gorgeous. All that glass..... Nope. Bad! Metal would be better, but a nice high quality plastic would be best. Is Samsung in the pocket of Big Glass? enoch861 I've switched my S7 Edge between UHD and HD and I've never really noticed a battery life difference between the two. My battery has been overall atrocious for some reason, but I can't find the perpetrator. Overall I'm not sure if I'll be upgrading even though the S8+ looks quite attractive. illregal Samsung cheap garbage mainstream phones for the followers TechGuy22 LOL illregal funny because it's true. 2kool4skool ...that will sell millions. illregal yeah, there are walmarts all over the place as well. Quantity sold is not a factor of quality. 2kool4skool Then what is the factor of quality in this case? Amount of raging fanboys in tech forums? Flagships cost a lot these days. The fact that tens of millions of people trust their hard earned money with Samsung devices might say something about its quality. illregal It actually says something about their inability to think for themselves. Their inability to know what the difference between devices is in the first place. Most people call android devices droids. or think samsung is the only company that even makes android devices. You're giving people to much credit. They are much more dumb than you assume. Plus they saw 4 commercials for samsung crap during their episode of dancing with the stars, so it has to be good right!?? 2kool4skool And how do you think Samsung able to get all over the place in the first place? Samsung mobile division also start with with a humble beginning like every other android oem company. Htc arguably was a bigger player in early android days. But Samsung has consistently able to give what people want until today, that's why it keeps growing and expanding and now you can see 4 commercial about it during episodes of dancing with the stars. Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà It's called capitalism. And it works most of the time. Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà Yes quantity is an indicator of quality. McDonald's doesn't make the best quality food, but they sell the most because it's the best and most consistent quality fast food. I say that as someone who would never eat there, too. You don't compare McDonald's to Ruth's Chris, because they're not in the same category. The S8 and S8+ will sell gazillions because they're the best quality flagship phones. illregal You just contradicted yourself. They will sell gazillions because they are all over the place, and people are bombarded with ads, and don't know any better. Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà Debating with you is a waste of time, but McDonald's is all over the place because people like the food. If nobody liked it, they couldn't open so many locations. Consumers love Samsung phones. Deal. illregal I know what people love.. Problem is I have to support their poor choices. Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà Well, I don't have to support your idiotic comments. You're blocked now. Suicide_Note Cheap? Nope. Garbage? Nope. Mainstream? Yes, but that's what happens when you sell tens of millions of devices. XDAMM Excuse me while I enjoy my gorgeously designed phone with the best display and top tier cameras, performance and battery life. Samsung's S series are indeed mainstream but they're not cheap and they are definitely not garbage. Their software could always improve and they could release major Android versions faster but their hardware game is just too strong and at least their software is usually stable and reliable (unlike previous Nexus phones and the Pixel which continue to be plagued by Bluetooth issues even months after release). I'd love having a consistent 60fps UI like the Pixel does but I won't sacrifice other software additions and considerably better hardware just for smoothness. illregal sweet pink display yo. sweet top tier, meaning not as good as some cameras yo. Performance, yo.. Enjoy your stutters. and average battery life. Cat Astrophy Enjoy your pocket explosive XDAMM Really? That was funny and relevant when the Note 7 was confirmed of having that issue but not anymore. If you think about it every battery powered device is a potential hazard but we don't usually worry about our Bluetooth headphones or laptops exploding even though that happens often. A few S8 will likely combust because statistically speaking it's nearly impossible to make a perfect phone, but its quite unlikely for that to become a widespread issue again. Jumanji! Be honest - do you work for Saygus? Middlefinger Compared to who? Google? Its phones are total junk, riddled with hardware and software faults, and over priced. TechGuy22 i'm buying S8+ used probably the exynos version so i can put AOSP on it Bewear That would have been considered a crazy idea some years ago. Time sure changes everything! 2kool4skool Always go with exynos version. Smother and more battery life. The only drawback is a bit weaker gpu than SD version, but meh, we're not going to play crysis on it anyway. TechGuy22 yeah i can't be with a locked down phone. Tech Writer The GPU is more powerful on exynos this time around. Toss3 "I would seriously worry about breaking this phone if I bought it. There is so much glass - Samsung phones essentially require cases." - Not sure I agree as the glass is pretty tough if the S7/S7 Edge are anything to go by. Only thing I didn't like about the S8 is the curvature on the front glass, as it is just too much and makes the display look distorted. Middlefinger I agree, plus the glass can be changed, whereas a metal unibody cant (as easily) and dents/ scratches much more easily. Ammar I just cannot decide between this and the Pixel XL. S8 is just a sultry, almost exotic looking device. But despite what the reviews will say, I doubt the performance and battery will be as consistent. jonathan If you want consistent performance and timely updates go for the pixel or wait for the next pixel, if you want a sexy device go with the S8. Me myself I always prefer the device with consitant performance and timely updates XDAMM I care more about a fast and responsive UI, fast app opening and switching and good gaming performance than 60FPS UI. Because of this, the better display, cameras, ingress protection rating, iris scanner, wireless charging and 64GB of (faster) storage by default there is just no comparison and I'll get the S8. The Pixel is an interesting proposition but it's not sold officially in my country and they have so many Bluetooth and battery related issues they're just not worth the asking price and trouble IMO. Rod http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif P. Sherman Bluetooth on Pixels are damn near UNUSABLE since launch. The fingerprint reader was rendered UNUSABLE in 7.1.2. Lags here and there are infinitely more acceptable than hardware failures, which apparently the Pixel is very good at. Rod I don't think inconsistent performance is acceptable on a > 720 bucks device. P. Sherman But it's still better than NON-PERFORMANCE. 2kool4skool The only thing I don't like from this otherwise great devices is the extra "Bixby" button. It kinda mess up the seamlessness of the device a little bit. But I don't think it's would be a significant upgrade from s7 edge, but I really like where Samsung is heading with these new devices, though. I'll wait for the next iteration, if the rumors are true, next galaxy s would probably feature an under-screen fingerprint scanner. It would make the device evn more seamless, they could get rid the home button entirely. One could only hope. Ome Dries Are the screenshots on the S8 square? That means it renders pixels the display can't even show, imagine how much performance & battery life they could've gained 2kool4skool Considering it renders 4262400 pixels by default, I don't think few pixels on the corners would make that much of a difference. create812 Stock Android or bust. Also, what's the deal with Project Fi? Can any phone with the proper radios take advantage of a Project Fi SIM, or does Goog only allow "approved" phones? Marty Only Nexii and the Pixels. create812 I think I saw a video early in the Project Fi days of a Samsung phone having a Fi SIM in it, and it partially worked (only worked with one of the carriers). I'm wondering what the current status of this is. Can someone pop a Fi SIM into their S8 and figure out what happens? Max Apparently we can also include now Nokia phones. raazman Can't wait to see what they're gonna do. OligarchyAmbulance Nokias are supposed to work on Fi? Max Not at the moment, but the rumor mill is that they want to be "the next Nexus" so depending on their relationship with Google that could be the case in the future. Just a guess based on rumors so take it with a grain of salt. FeelThePoveR Or OnePlus. (Or custom roms in my case) Roy No. OnePlus tow don't got any nougat Defenestratus What is stock android these days? I don't even know. EvilHowl AOSP Eric Abreu You can use a Project Fi sim card with other phones, but you'll only have access to the T-Mobile network. I think that you'll also need to activate the sim card on a Nexus or Pixel device before moving it to a non-Google device 2kool4skool "Stock Android or bust." You're missing out so many great phones out there. raazman What's so great about them? Mike Limited bezels is a good start. Realistically, to keep this short it would be more what's so great about stock phones: 1. Fast Updates 2. Quicker UI 3. ........ That's about it. raazman Quicker UI? I beg to differ. Fast updates? Um what? Not even remotely close. Mike You need to read the entire comment to get what I'm saying. Unless you are, in fact, saying that Samsung's phones will get quicker updates than Pixel phones. raazman Oh, oops. I replied to 2kool4skool. I already know Google's Nexus Pixels are better in both regards. Mike And that's also where it ends in terms of what does stock offer over other Android phones. raazman Opinions I guess, because I differ on that stance. Mike Other than the two things I named, name something stock Android does better than a phone Samsung/LG released. FeelThePoveR Customizability which is the main point of android I guess. Middlefinger Whos updates? Googles or Samsungs? Recent events should tell you that rushing to install whatever Google pushes out isnt always a good thing. 2kool4skool They don't have endless problems like pixel and pixel xl for a start. raazman Ummm...you sure buddy? LG? Samsung TouchWiz? Which phones are we talking about here? And my Pixel XL has not had a problem yet. So I'm not convinced. Mike Ah, the good old "My ____ is working fine so obviously there's no issues at all". Hearing this always makes me appreciate what we've become. raazman I just commented saying I've seen this trend since the S3 among friends and family, calm down. Mike "And my Pixel XL has not had a problem yet. So I'm not convinced." Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà Nobody who owns a Pixel XL has a problem with it. Except those who do. 2kool4skool I don't know man, I tend to believe tech sites like this more than the trend among your friends and family. And this site talks a lot about pixel problems. The last one was 2 days ago about some pixels losing fingerprint scanner functionality after latest update, look it up. raazman How about note 7 explosions? TouchWiz lag? And now it seems like the S8 screen has color issues. 2kool4skool Here we go again with "my phone might have a lot of problems, but at least it doesn't explode" argument. Note 7 is dead, and people get their money back, so it literally cost people 0$. How much pixel cost? 800$? Stop comparing 0$ phone to 800$ one. raazman Haha you're delusional if you think the galaxies don't have issues. 2kool4skool I never think or said that. All phones have issues including galaxies. But it's the first time I see devices (pixel and pixel xl) with so much problems that continously popped up and being featured on Android sites for almost every two weeks. Roy Because everybody want to hear about Pixel so even it's a little bunch of users let's make a headlight. Rod Actually, many people lost $ due to cases and other accessories not being refunded. Middlefinger Never seem this mythical lag, the Note was bad, but a one off, this screen colour seems like a first batch issue like all devices have. The Pixel is just riddled with faults even the newest batch. Remember the N5 was redesigned because the first run was so poor, the N7 had terrible screen quality problems and slow NAND, HTCs have had multiple camera issues, the iPhone also had screen issues, Sony had battery issues. Its common. Rod How about this one? http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif Middlefinger Right, first release software (or even pre-release). Ive seen just as bad on a Nexus at release, if not worse. My Samsungs have never exhibited anything like that. Rod I've had 3 Nexus, and never saw anything like that either. Middlefinger Ive had 5, all had some lag, I returned 2 because they were poor quality. Roy Not really he was talking also about 6p and shocking it's smooth as ever. Most of the users don't have this problems. Middlefinger Samsung sell hundreds of millions of phones, Google has sold about 12 Pixels.. OK an exaggeration, but the point remains. If you sell more, a LOT LOT more, then problems seem more common, but as a percentage they arent. 2kool4skool And out of 12 pixels sold, 9 have problems. 9/12, needs more bugs. - IGN Rashad Actually, 9/12=.75 7.5 = Good -IGN Roy Not really. Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà Correction: HTC has shipped about 2 million Pixels and Pixel XLs since launch 6 months ago. Samsung has 20 million S8/S8+ phones ready for launch. Middlefinger and will sell more than 2 million in the first day. Nexus/pixel sales have always been poor, just like the product. Roy My 6p also no problem. illregal Samsungs have more hardware and software issues than everyone else combined. raazman Since the S3, yes this is what I've personally seen among friends and family. 2kool4skool Lol, who are we kidding here? You can find bunch of articles about pixel problems on this site. Last article I read was 2 days ago about some pixels lost ability to set up fingerprint scanner after latest update. Roy Haha but it isn't true my 6p rocking with a great fingerprint scanner. Middlefinger I think the Pixel has that crown now. I have had zero problems with any of my Samsungs, ive returned all my Nexus devices due to faults and poor quality. create812 I know, but stock Android, fast updates, and compatibility with Fi are my top priorities. Roy Not really. Not looking for junk. Defenestratus Picking up my S8+ on Friday - despite Bixby stupidity. I'm praying that the community figures out how to disable it. I currently have a Nexus 6P that constantly infuriates me. The pixel was not a value proposition that I was convinced was worth it - and I doubt the Pixel 2 will be either if they stick with the old, tired form factors and tiny screen sizes. So S8+ is what I'm left with. We'll see if it leads to user angst or not. I'm trying my best to be optimistic. Jay If it can be disabled by a package disabler, I'll be happy. I think. catalysto Early rumors say Pixel 2 will have a much smaller bezel like the other phones coming out this generation. I wouldn't make any assumptions yet. 2kool4skool If Google wanted smaller bezel for their pixel 2, they gonna need to pick some company other than Htc to do their devices. Htc simply can't manufacture a phone with small bezel or water resistant because their manufacturing process is outdated. catalysto Who says Google won't do that? 2kool4skool I never said, that. In fact, I think It would be cool if they go with Motorola this year. illregal their manufacturing process isn't outdated. They just care. They mill out unibody designs from a solid block. Which takes time and effort. Unlike samsung, who just stamps out garbage, quantity quantity quantity. 2kool4skool Have you seen their latest device, htc u? It's enormous in size, but only has 3000mah battery. It's thick af, yet it still has a very protuding camera. It doesn't even have audio jack, water resistance, and wireless charging yet yet it still cost an arm and leg. If that's what you mean by care, I can't imagine how much shittier their device would be if they made if without care. Jay There might be a few more compromises here than I originally thought but it's too late to cancel my pre-order. Now I don't know whether I should even bother. üòï Thanks for this uncertainty now, David. (Partially kidding..) 4Ui812 I see the red tint in most pics. AC has a story about that problem with some phones in Korea . Is the bootloader locked down like with the S7E ? http://www.androidauthority.com/galaxy-s8-displays-red-discoloration-764692/ https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2550b567c5a3bd243534cc66e251d0edbb770bd373e83a7961b5012e2e49c482.jpg Marty Holy shit! The HTC S8. 2kool4skool Probably just some devices with miscalibrated screen, for now can be solved by lowering red pixel intensity in setting. But they'll probably fix it via OTA later. Samsung introduced new screen calibration setting on nougat, you can set the intensity of each of RGB pixels to meet your desired color balance. Here's setting screenshot on my s7 edge. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/78c23a79995e1f76d6daf742ac05cc0f8893b2871459eeb4cdfec41c6eef2872.png illregal You can't fix poor screen quality with an OTA. If you lower a setting to calibrate a device via an update. The ones without the issue will then be more off. It's not a matter of adjustments, its a matter of poor qc and not yielding consistent products. 2kool4skool How it's "poor screen quality"? It's not hardware problem. Just some minor adjustments via OTA, and it will be fixed. If you're asking how they're gonna fix it without ruining other devices, the answer is the same way Google fixes pixels with Bluetooth problem without ruining the ones that's function just fine. It's software problem, they're gonna figure something out. FeelThePoveR It may as well be a hardware problem, because why couldn't it be? 2kool4skool I highly doubt that, because as I said before the problem can simply be solved by lowering red pixel intensity in setting. Galaxy s screens has always feature calibration setting as a feature, probably it's just some sloppy written code messing up with the setting. And if that's the case, it would be fixable via OTA. Take my answer with a grain of salt, though. Because we still need confirmation from Samsung if that's indeed the case. This is merely the logical answer I can think of for this problem. catalysto Is calibration the problem? Because software cannot calibrate a screen without being able to see it. So no, an OTA would not be able to fix that. The screen must be calibrated at the factory. 2kool4skool Software doesn't necessarily needs to see the screen in this case. Samsung can get their hands on the affected device, tweak it and figure which screen batch affected, and send tweaked software to all devices via OTA. Your comment does make sense, though. Unless Samsung can figure out which devices affected and need for fix, users probably will have to resort to the last option, go to setting and tweak it themselves manually. illregal what I'm saying is.. You can't push out an ota to adjust the screen calibration. Because how is that OTA gonna pick n choose which ones need the adjustment and which ones don't. It's a hardware issue. Samsung makes garbage. 2kool4skool They don't necessarily have to send out an OTA that needs to pick which ones need adjustment and which ones don't. They can just send an OTA that works for both as intended. But whatever, you can believe what you want to. I merely stated what I think a logical answer for this problem. Middlefinger You can if its due to a setting. HTC managed to get rid of a huge red blob in the middle of the HD2 camera with an update. Plenty, like you, assumed it was a hardware fault. Rod It's not. https://i.imgur.com/oYe2HPZ.jpg Rod The problem is, if those devices already have those values maxed out. 2kool4skool Actually, rather than fixed values, these RGB settings act more like percentage values. Meaning you can set them lower and it wouldn't make a difference unless one value is bigger than another. It's hard to describe but I'll include another screenshot. The result would be the same even if you lower those values as long as it's on the same level. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2788b47dbae19707db41c131c25f545abf51fe7ac923621517261397b1c4390b.png same as https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/78c23a79995e1f76d6daf742ac05cc0f8893b2871459eeb4cdfec41c6eef2872.png Rod Yeah, I know. That value was arbitrary. Though now I'd like to know from Ruddock himself what were the default values in his review unit. 2kool4skool Yeah, and apparently some screens might interpret those values differently / inaccurately, hence the problem. And if that's correct, an OTA fix should be logically possible. That's all what I was saying. Rod I hope so. But all OLED panels I've seen to this date, has screen tint of some color. Either red or green. 2kool4skool Can't deny that. Some OLED panels, especially the lower end ones are struggling to produce a balanced color, it's usually most noticeable while viewing white color. That's why IPS screens usually produce better whites than oleds. But oleds produce deeper black than IPS. In the end, each have strength and weaknesses. Get what you prefer. Rod Yeah. I, for one, prefer pure white. Can't stand the reddish whites on the S8 reviewed here. C Lo Who doesn't enjoy buying a $900 device and then having to fix it yourself. Sounds like a swell situation to me. /s 2kool4skool Nobody said that. It sucks that this problem happens. We're just discussing possible fix for it, not trying to disregard the problem itself. Rod Oh boy..... https://i.imgur.com/oYe2HPZ.jpg 2kool4skool You really don't get it, do you? That's why I said it's miscalibrated. Although both of those devices have the same RGB values, the affected device read and interpret those values incorrectly. On affected device, you need to lower the Red value to something like this in order to make the red tint disappear. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/5ae0be301ee03f23d53f275a783d6c59be4e7147070152bed2c42ae2ce2551fe.png These articles might explain it better that I do.

Rod Explain this, then. https://i.imgur.com/a1e3dTw.jpg Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà Pinkgate.

The LG G6 has a very distinct blue tint. Funny how there are no articles about that. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/b8c2b9fbef728965ff12187f4f2d10a00f0a4b70842c6075f1655f26f156ae75.png 4Ui812 Maybe that's part of the manufacturing process , I don't know. But I know not all S8's have the Red tint issue , therefore it's called a defect. Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà Maybe it is a defect, I don't know. If I got a pink one, I'd return it. I wouldn't accept a software update. I'm also wondering if at least some of the people who think they have pink displays simply have the blue filter turned on. 4Ui812 The blue filter shouldn't be causing that sort of issue. Hell the blue filter on my s7e doesn't make that much of a difference. Badelhas A phone made entirely out of glass? lol. No, thanks. 4Ui812 There are metal parts inside üòÅ Badelhas That's why it's not transparent, then! üòä m477 I can't say I actually care the phone renders in 1080p by default, I'll take the extra battery life. Tests have demonstrated that using lower then native resolutions has no appreciable benefit to the battery. What you gain is a more stable FPS count. dabug91 Exactly, there may be a slight difference if you're constantly playing games, but regardless of whether you're in 1080p or 1440p mode, every single one of those pixels on the screen is still turned on and using the same amount of power other than pure black. makapav You will only recover energy saved on CPU and GPU cycles that would otherwise have been used for rendering those extra pixels. Morten Ulv Wont those just be used at giving you higher FPS? Either way, I guess the point was that the difference is negligible. Abhishek Saral So like if I run a 4K XPS 15 on 1080P resolution. Will I see a battery improvement? Tech Writer Not much at all. On the other hand, if you get the 1080p XPS 15, it will last much longer. Most of the higher power consumption of higher res screens comes from the panel itself. Changing render resolution doesn't change this, unless you do native res 3D rendering or play games. David Ruddock Alright, that may well be. I'll adjust to "performance." D13H4RD2L1V3 Probably the only savings you'd get is from the processor not needing to drive a lot more pixels. It's usually quite minimal at best, imperceptibly so at worst. Rod 1080p vs 1440p when drawing 2D is a non-issue, actually. Liam Bulkley "...one would expect, but that turns out not to be the case on this device" :-D godutch It's less calculations though, gpu is less used and can clock lower m477 The impact of the GPU on the battery is very, very small, unless graphically intensive games are in use. End even then, the difference between 1440p and 1080p is not that big. DanSan I pre-ordered the GS8+. Coming from the Nexus 6, this seemed to be my best option even after playing with both phones extensively the day after they were announced. I'm going to miss my Nexus experience but honestly I'm tired of being a beta tester for Googles software. Past couple of months my N6 has been almost useless at times, freezing doing basic tasks. I don't care about locked bootloaders or rooting anymore, I just want to be able to tweak a few things to my liking and have a phone that just.... works. Max If you're picky then there's a very high chance that you will regret moving to a Samsung phone if you are looking for "a phone that just... works". Samsung software has many annoyances for people accustomed to the Google Android experience. demarcmj This. Every time I try to help a family member with their galaxy device I get really frustrated trying to figure out how the damn thing works. DanSan I assume thats because you're going from stock android to Samsung experience, I can understand the confusion Zsolt V And hundreds of millions of people have no such problems. Interesting. DanSan Totally agree with you but doing simple things now are a pain for me. I just want to unlock it and take a picture or text somebody. easy and simple. catalysto Not sure what the problem is on yours. Mine can open the camera instantly with a power button double-press. DanSan That may be true, time will tell. I have an iPhone 6S as a work device, I end up using that because my Nexus 6 has become so bad. Even after a factory wipe. I will take any kind of change Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà We have two iPhone 6S phones in our family. They both "just work" unless there's an iOS update waiting. After updating, they both "just work" again. I have to wonder if some of the apps update before the OS does, and that's why the problems occur when the update hasn't yet been applied. Just a guess. Suhas I switched to S6 Edge+ eighteen months ago from a N5 after being a loyal Nexus user since the Galaxy Nexus. Surprisingly, it was the best decision ever. Back in the day I used to root, flash custom ROMs and tinker with the phone a lot which I ain't bothered to do so anymore. Also the Nexus kept failing on me in certain areas (Bluetooth, memory leaks, sub-par speakers, camera, battery etc.) and I got fed up. The S6 Edge+ was worth the price and it has been an amazing phone. Can't wait to get my hands on the S8! Switch and you will not regret. DanSan I'm pumped but definitely going to be a learning curve when it comes to samsung settings and what not. But i think we were in the same boat, just tired of tweaking and tinkering to get it to do what i want. Even now I have to make excuses for how bad my phone is, granted its a few years old but I'm over it. Gjorgi Lazarovski well you made the wrong choice going with a Samsung device, since "nothing" works on them. You always get the weirdest bug reports from Samsung users. They have issues with a bunch of apps. 2kool4skool Lol if you're talking about bugs, look no further than pixel and pixel xl. You can find bunch of articles about problems with these devices on this site. You have problems ranging from Bluetooth issue, camera halo / lens flare, dodgy connection, fingerprint issue, etc etc, I lost track. Do your research.

Jaime does anybody know if the galaxy s8 has the At&t logo on the back? can't find any image of it (which is great!), but I don't want to be disappointed when my phone arrives with an ugly logo on it's back. wests It does not. The Rebrand Nation From laggy touchwiz 5 of the galaxy s5 to near perfect smasung experience 8.1 Not bad for 4 years FeelThePoveR Considering that OnePlus rose from nothing to the company they are today in 4 years and the fact that Samsung is supposed to be the top player with highest development budget of all, it's pretty bad. Bob Marley They didn't rise from nothing. They have the funding and resources of Oppo, a major smartphone player, behind their back. FeelThePoveR They had to build their "brand" from nothing and their success is impressive, becouse at least where I live people prefer to buy things from known brands even if it's not the best bang for buck, as they don't trust the newcomers. Middlefinger But Oneplus phones still have boatloads of issues and very dubious quality, both hardware and software. FeelThePoveR Boatloads of issues? I wouldn't say so, every device has it's quirks but OnePlus is really good at listening to the community and fixing them. Dubious quality? 1+3 and 1+3T are the fastest Snapdragon 820 and 821 devices ever for half of the price of other comperable devices so what about that is so dubious? Maybe camera is not a top notch one but it's good anyway, certainly good enough for the price. Middlefinger Build quality, and reliability is the problem. I'm a regional manager for a electronics service/retail company, we get a lot back, they just aren't made very well. FeelThePoveR Well I've seen a couple from the inside and they seemed really neatly designed/put together and besides even phones from the "old players" could cause more trouble then 1+ ones i.e. LG with its loose components on the motherboard causing bootlops, Samsung Note 7 burning battery or my oldy HTC M7 purple camera tint issue. Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà From feature-free stock Android to Nougat with split screen. Not bad for 4 years. Middlefinger Really it was done in 1 year.

Rod Near perfect? http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif Nishant i guess this would be a great upgrade from my Galaxy S3!!! :) Cat Astrophy So what you're saying...is that this phone is THE BOMB? Typical Samsung. I like my phones non-explodey. My name is‚Ä¶. biased, as always. You call this phone pricey? Then what is Pixel? DanSan There is a difference between being pricey for the sake of being pricey (read: Pixel) and being pricey because you have the best spec available. lomsha Yep at least this looks and feels like an $850 phone. Gjorgi Lazarovski Why biased tho? They called out the Pixel for it's price too, wtf. Like, everyone did. David Ruddock I don't know, maybe read our review? "Price: There's no way around it, the price points are high. iPhone high. And you're going to be hard-pressed to convince the value-obsessed that there's nearly $800 of smartphone in a Pixel XL." http://www.androidpolice.com/2016/10/18/google-pixel-review-a-very-good-phone-by-google/ My name is‚Ä¶. Pixel is a dud, worst value for money ever. You should have been far more negative for Pixel than you were. Sweet talking it doesn't change things. Just because you mention that the price was high, doent meant that you shouldnt have angrily bashed it (if you were a subjective reviewer) And no, S8 doesn't ask a lot. Its a true flagship with the appropriate price. 1+3 owner here. 2kool4skool Shhh... Pixels have G logo on their back. That alone worth the $200. Seriously though, pixels are often get too many undeserved praises (just my opinion) in tech sites, probably because it's the "nerds and purists" devices, which make up most of tech sites target audience. It even got best phone of the year award if I'm not mistaken despite the fact it doesn't have a lot of features a $800 phones should have anf it's infested with bugs and problems even until this day. Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà All Google phones get undeserved praise, especially on Android sites. The reason for that should be self-evident. It's self-preservation. Defenestratus It's just a dang shame that you aren't on the editorial payroll at AP. Just a dang shame I tell ya. Max Big comment fail... Both are pricey and both were called for it. Middlefinger Still hung up on updates i see. Is Googles 7.1.whatever really any better than 7.0 with Samsungs mods? Whats the difference? Whats the advantage? In reality, there isnt any. Samsung doesnt run stock android, and isnt bound by Googles mods, or Googles fixes. It can do its own, and that may mean having a slightly lower number in the settings, but it has no negative effect on the security or experience. Other OEMs are the same LG never used 4.4.3 or 4.4.4 on the G2 or 3, but had al the fixes and updates they needed, because the Google updates were device specific and not necessary. Benjamin Walburn It might not make a difference for bugs and security flaws, but certain APIs need the OS update. The image keyboard and app icon shortcuts are two examples. More importantly, there's just no reason to not use 7.1. It's been 4 months since official launch, and major OEMs get early access. Middlefinger Maybe Samsung arent happy with the quality? 7.1 and its variant have been rather.. buggy, of late. Lollipop was like that, its was the worst, and i know Samsung had a lot of custom code in their version. There is no reason though why Samsung cant implement its own version of APIs, or simply wait to avoid issues. Rod Just stop. Middlefinger Stop what? Do you even read this site, the evidence is right here. Rod Samsung doesn't keep their phones updated because they're too busy making unwanted, duplicate apps. Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà Yeah, Google never makes unwanted duplicate apps. Rod Such as? tim242 You need to get a life, if all you have to do is bitch about duplicate apps. EVERY DAY. Rod My life is fine, thanks. Middlefinger No they make time to release to make sure the software works properly. They have to do that because Googles release often doesn't, just like all the problems seen on 7.1.2 lately. Unwanted apps you say?? Like most of the Google apps.. Rod You make it look better than it is. Samsung phones are the most buggy, according to the developers. Middlefinger Are they now, where is this 'developer' news i seem to have missed? Rod https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/3xgxg2/why_is_there_so_much_hate_against_samsung/ Middlefinger One temporary example that is not longer true. What about all of googles messy code and bugs, that kill phones? Benjamin Walburn Oh, they definitely could, but a duplicate API isn't the same as the original, especially in Android. App developers would have to add additional code for the Samsung API. Even mirroring the API entirely wouldn't work, as apps look at the system API level to decide how to run. Even if Samsung copied it perfectly, apps would still detect it as an older Android version and not use the features. I can't comment on the bugginess of the later release. I haven't had any problems with updates, but that would be a valid concern. Godspoken That hero image is freaking amazing. Is the picture on the screen photoshopped? I almost read AP reviews for the great photographs of phones as much as I do for the actual facts and opinions at this point. David Ruddock It's a real image. The screen is color corrected a bit (thanks to Jeff for that) to match the tone of the pavement. But I took the photo on the S8, zoomed in and lined it up, then took the picture with my RX10, yeah. Rod Of course it was edited, to remove the red tint. Lol Crafted Crows It is an impressive piece of hardware but after 1 day of use my fingers hurt :). I have the S7 and I find that size to be perfect. While the screen gorgeous, it's too tall for 1 hand use and the infamous hamburger menu is killing my fingers. Not comfortable at all. Margaritas Ante Porcos Great review. As always. Beautiful phone but we won't see the beauty because we'll have to hide this fragile cutie inside a case. Also Bixby is total crap. So sad to say this but as many other disappointed Galaxy fans I will skip on S8. Absolutely not worth buying. At least not for that money. Fr0gg0 Better luck next time, Samsung. Dallas King Fingerprint scanner on the power button, on the side would have been better. Eumelanin Knight Samsung sees to have an innovative then perfect cycle with their phone.

The story you linked says only SOME UNITS AND CAN BE MANUALLY FIXED. Rod Well, let's ask @rdr0b11:disqus then BTW: never saw anyone take pictures in broad daylight whilst illuminating the subject with a red light. Maybe the sun shines differently where he lives. Roy You are right, the red tint is clearly noticeable from the pictures and it's bothering me a lot that no one (not even the reviewer) is talking about it. Rod As a LCD-phone owner, I'm deeply disturbed by screen tint. I like my whites milk-like. mlj11 I know Bixby's gonna be unpopular (around the enthusiast crowd at least) but I wish I had something like Bixby Vision. After Goggles' apparent abandonment by Google, I still haven't found a simple and good enough replacement for it.

I'm sorry for picking on you, but this is the third time I've seen this misspelling this week and I'm starting to wonder if I'm going slightly mad! Surely 'paid' is a common enough word that everyone should know how to spell it? m477 Welp, I must have been drunk or something. I usually write in mostly correct English, I swear. Miles Reiter To add on to what others have already said, that's not a grayed out option, there's no scenario in Instagram where the search button will be grayed out and non-functional. Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà So he just didn't touch it. It's very obvious he's not touching anything on the phone in that GIF. You could also take a screen shot of that Instagram page, and fake it that way. I'll believe these problems when I see them widely reported, not because some bozo posts a gif. JC Just go watch the video. Railwayman Rule no 1 for the Humanity: Galaxy S model X is the BEST DEVICE IN THE WORLD (must be stated in caps so no one miss this basic FACT!) Every kind of criticism of a Galaxy S device are FAKE. Galaxy S is simply the BEST and everyone who are disagreeing are just ignorant and try to escape the reality. Galaxy S is also the FASTEST device in the world, no one comes even close - every video showing any kind of slow down below 120 fps and instant response are FAKE. It is the FASTEST device and this fact take precedence over everything else. Don't question the ALMIGHTY GALAXY! It can lead to the Samsung Underground, which is a world where everyone has a Galaxy with Knox 0x1 Warranty Void and are expected to use Health and Gear VR daily, otherwise they will be punished! Winston Thats a strange issue. I loaded the S8 home screen + Hello Bixby onto my S7. No lag. Rod It's called inconsistent performance. Which means it won't happen all the time. PoisonApple31 Which is why it is not a big deal Rod For someone shelling out 800 bucks for a phone, I think it's not ok. iPhones will be butter-smooth for the same price. Liam Bulkley Mostly. iPhones stutter as well. They do still have the best touch latency, though. Peter World Citizen Looks fake ... Rod What does? Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà It is fake. Brad Andrews Having used the S8+ for the last 24hrs and being the furthest thing from a Samsung fanboy as possible I.e the last galaxy I owned was the S3 and I truly thought my next phone would be the pixel 2 - All I can say is, Google have gotta step up massively with the pixel 2 if they want to compete. This phone is super smooth (even the stupid bixby app) and an absolute pleasure to use, I really never thought I'd say that about a Samsung phone. Say what you will about Samsung phones of the past, but have a week with 1 of these and I'd say all but the most hardcore pixel purests would be converted, or at least concede it's a great phone. Rod Everyone said the same about the Note 7, until... https://www.xda-developers.com/with-the-note-7-samsung-still-delivers-embarrassing-real-world-performance/ Brad Andrews Hey, I'm just calling it as I see it. If this thing slows down and starts lagging I'm more than happy to sell it and grab the pixel 2 when it comes out. As it stands right now, my opinion is that it's a great phone with no lag. I'm sure if we wanted to, we could find an instance of a pixel lagging in what is basically a 3rd party app (bixby) as well. So this one gif all you Samsung haters are frothing over isn't what I'd call conclusive evidence, it's certainly not what I've experienced. Kevin Davis Great review, thanks. Beautiful phones, but they're going to be a pass for me. Vivek Rameses You can install the new launcher by updating the TouchWiz apk on apkmirror. Had it for a few weeks and it runs fine. Rocket Bixby Vision can identify objects. I showed it a Galaxy S7. It gave me results for iPads. Sounds like Apple will be picking up this idea for Siri pretty soon Marty LMAO...Even machines know Sammy copies Cakefish Interestingly, from the reviews that I have been reading, the Exynos 8890 beats the Snapdragon 835 in single-core Geekbench performance and loses narrowly in multi-core performance. So, overall, very similar levels of performance. Shows that Samsung was ahead of the curve last year, meaning that the Galaxy S7 should age well CPU-wise. Marty I think I can easily pass on the S8. I prefer a device not have a pink tinted display. The last time this happened was with the HTC 10. Too much competition, Samsung, for you to put out lackluster products. jasonlowr Well, Firstly, you dont have the money. Secondly, everyone knows you're a samsung hater. Come on, whenever you comment on any samsung articles,its all about hates from you. Last but not least, youre not a very good actor/lier. Lol. Peace! Marty Lol...Keep your day job. You're funny, but the other kind of funny. üòÅ 4Ui812 David Ruddock 2 questions. Do you know if the bootloader is locked like on the S7E from T-MOBILE ? Why is this 8 hour old article pushed to the top of the list ? I think I know the answer to the second question. But do you have any info on the first ? Rod Because it's relevant? 4Ui812 Paid. Rod Yes, they get paid better when more people click on pages with ads. roverstim ewww, pink tint. D13H4RD2L1V3 I can definitely see the fingerprint sensor placement being an afterthought. Had Synaptics and Samsung got that display sensor working in time, the feature where you can wake the device from sleep by "pressing" the portion of the display that houses the home button would have a lot more worth. Oh well, hope it's ready in time for the Note 8, but with rumors that even Apple is having issues with it, we may have to wait for 2018. I don't find Bixby all that useful, and certainly not to the point where it needs its own button. It has its merits, but overall, I feel that it's one of those features where people use once or twice after unboxing and then forget that it existed, like Siri, or those who are deeply-vested in the Google ecosystem would probably just use Google Now. I find that rather sad, because some of its other add-ons, such as the ability to play other forms of audio through the device itself while it's casting another audio source via Bluetooth is one of those things that are immensely useful. I just wish that they're actually more prominently shown so that people know it exists. It's a nice phone overall, though. Makes me optimistic for the next Galaxy Note. tim242 THE CAMERA IS NOT THE SAME AS THE S7. 260 VS 333 Rod Who do those numbers represent? tim242 The S7 has the Sony 260. The S8 has the Sony 333. Michaels_28 I've heard that it is the same hardware, different firmware. (and different software) tim242 It is a new sensor.. This has been confirmed. The S7 has the IMX260, the S8 has the IMX333 dblock I am a huge fan of rooting and ROMing my phones, but the truth is, being a crack flasher and flashing new ROMs all the time is really time consuming. So while it will take a while to get used to not being able to do this, and losing Viper4Android (hoping I can make Samsung's EQ work somewhat close to V4A) and some other customizations/tweaks, overall I think I will be more satisfied not worrying about trying to flash the "best" ROM all the damn time. I do hold out hope that basic root is achieved on the phone so I can get V4A going on this thing, but I won't hold out too long. 2kool4skool If you're so worried about sound, galaxies have Adapt Sound feature that you might want to try out. I'm also a former user of viper4android, but decided to ditch it last year because adapt sound is easier to set up. It also sounds fantastic on my hd 449. dblock I can't remember if Adapt Sound works with Bluetooth headphones or not, do you know if it does? That's why I loved V4A, could really fine tune all different output types; phone speakers, headset, Bluetooth and dock. 2kool4skool Well, that's a bummer. No, as far as I know it doesn't work with Bluetooth headphones. ROB You need to add something... DO NOT BUY the unlocked version Chips N Care to explain? ROB Google the S7 unlocked fiasco...they are still on 6.0.1...all other S7 have been updated to 7.0 and they have abandoned the ones bought directly from Samsung... Cakefish Galaxy S7 Geekbench scores. The Exynos 8890 processor was ahead of its time, it'll remain very competitive throughout 2017. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/ccc4e4d7770fbc4f43c68d526b56060883fe49a88537a5e39d175e8207d6c05e.png Rod If even the Snapdragon 800 holds well to this day.. blairh Fingerprint placement is complete garbage. Still no stereo speakers. S8 is too tall. More impressed with the S8 Plus. TeeJay1100 Size is personal preference. I'll say this, after playing with them in Best buy, the S8 feels just right. The S8+ is a tad taller. blairh The S8 is too tall IMO. tim242 The S8+ is even taller... blairh I just think the S8 is way too tall when compared to the iPhone 7. Apple will be releasing a 5.8" screen phone this fall with roughly the same footprint of the iPhone 7. That to me makes a lot more sense then going so tall as the S8 for the same size screen. tim242 You have no idea what dimensions the next iphones will be. blairh You're right. But I also believe the strong rumors of a 5.8" screen with a footprint the size of the current iPhone 7. tim242 There were those same strong rumors about the S8. The current iphone 7 would not fit a 16:9 5.8" display... blairh I believe this is what we will see this fall. http://www.iclarified.com/60037/diagram-allegedly-reveals-design-of-58inch-iphone-with-4mm-bezels-images tim242 Yeah, no. Apple has had gigantic bezels for 10 years. They aren't going to be suddenly nothing. blairh You're dead wrong. Gruber was saying in spring of 2016 that his sources have told him how they want an iPhone that is all screen. I expect minimal to no bezel on the next iPhone. Ming Chi Kuo is also backing up this story with his reports. tim242 There will most likely be smaller bezel, but most likely not what you are describing...especially if they are unable to get the fingerprint scanner under the display. Rod Isn't the S8 even taller? Lol blairh I'm assuming you mean the S8 Plus. Yes, it is, but it also has a larger screen. I just think the S8 is way too tall when compared to the iPhone 7. Apple will be releasing a 5.8" screen phone this fall with roughly the same footprint of the iPhone 7. That to me makes a lot more sense then going so tall as the S8 for the same size screen. Rod But the S8+ is proportionally taller than the S8 lol. blairh I understand that. But I can swallow that size phone when the screen is that large. I think the next iPhone will give you the same size screen in a smaller package. Michaels_28 iPhone 7's body cannot house a 5.8" screen even with zero bezel. blairh It absolutely can. Corner to corner diagonally it's 6". Semianonymous Kinda reminds me of the s6 in a lot of ways. Sacrifices made to acheive a new design. At least they didn't kill the waterproofing and SD slot this time around. lomsha I'm quite tempted. Paul Quinn We knew about the poor fingerprint sensor placement for quite some time. I thought that's probably something that could prove to be less of an issue over time (muscle memory). But now it's sounding like it doesn't even work well. That is enough to kill it for me. I am spoiled by instantaneous unlock on the Mate 9. I don't understand how a brand new phone from THE premier Android manufacturer isn't at least getting close to that. Rod Rushed changed. It was supposed to be underneath the screen. Zahir_SMASH I just want to know what round icon pack that is. Cakefish Pretty sure it's the same one as I use: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.themezilla.pixelui Rod Looks neat for a free app. Zahir_SMASH Thanks! Roy Am I the only one noticing the red-tinted screen issue with the photos of the reviewed device? tim242 Some units have that, mostly the units sent out early. It can be adjusted in settings. Roy Not necessarily. Xda reported that in some units the red-tinted display is not being fixed even after adjusting the rgb and samung is replaging those units. Also, why this reviewed unit was not adjusted before taking the pictures? Just look at them and tell me, the issue is pretty noticeable. Rod Don't worry, there are lots of people in denial here. Rod Oh boy... https://i.imgur.com/oYe2HPZ.jpg Rod Nope. √óXWreckTeamX√ó Which pics are you talking about I cant notice it that much. Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà It seems pretty obvious to me in all the photos of the phone where there's white on the display. The white looks pinkish. The screen shots look pure white, though. morrisp Are you in Studio City, David? Ahmad Alnusif Is this review applicable also to the Exynos version of S8+? I see mention of SnapDragon 835 specific features so will they be there in the international version? Fred Question is, where did you get that burger ? Anton Kuznetsov ADOPTABLE STORAGE Does it have it? Rod Seeing as they blocked it in the S7, I wouldn't hold my breath. Nathan J This is the first Android phone since last April when I chose the iPhone 6s over the LG G5 (which, given the bootloop reports, was probably a good choice) that has made me seriously consider switching back. One thought keeps repeating itself to me: the 2015 iPhone 6s will most likely get updates for one year after the 2017 Galaxy S8 stops getting them, given the companies' five and two year update ranges. I can see entry level phones only getting a year or two of updates, but a $750 or $850 phone? This is a hard truth that Android fanboys are going to have to accept, and really start demanding changes to. It's one thing that Apple absolutely does better, and I think it's something that would not be very hard to change. Let's demand five years of updates. Apple can do it and they're more profitable than anyone. Stop. Don't make excuses about why Apple's phones aren't that good or their updates aren't as significant. Don't excuse bad behavior. Have the courage to demand better. If all the phone manufacturers adopted all the best practices of their competitors, and shed their biggest problems, imagine how much more awesome phones would be. That said, we really don't know how long Samsung will update the S8. Maybe they give it three years. Who knows. They've done almost everything right here, and I commend them for that. I wouldn't have minded if they kept the physical home/fingerprint button, if they did it like on the iPhone 7. Not a real button but a part of the screen that vibrates in such a way that feels like a button. Go to a Best Buy and check it out. It's very cool. The fingerprint scanner as-is on the S8... I have seen no one praise this. I'm sure Samsung knows, and it was just too late for them to change it. If everything is the same next year (but updated of course), but the fingerprint reader is mid-center of the back, the S9 will be damn near perfect. As for Bixby ‚Äî in my opinion, the less said about it, Siri, and Google Assistant, the better. I'll just Google it. Or Bing it if I know I'll be running into ad-infested sites (like Wikia) as the Google app tunnels around my ad blocker (iOS). Either way, I'll take a search app over an assistant app any day of the week. I've tried Siri, Google, and Cortana and have found all of them lacking. So no thanks to Bixby. Disappointing about buttongate, but not a dealbreaker, either. Rod In most cases, the updates are ceased due to the SoC vendor (read: Qualcomm) not providing new blobs after 24 months. That's why there's a rumor Google is designing its own chip, like Apple and Samsung do, so they don't get blocked by Qualcomm. Nathan J I had a Motorola Photon. We heard all the excuses. At the end of the day, it's still a flagship that got zero updates, so it doesn't really matter whose fault it is or why. I mean, it's interesting on a trivial level to find out why, but you're no less screwed at the end of the day. That said, if Google could get control over the hardware in their phones, they'd be better off. Maybe. Can they make more money selling phones that are supported for five years? That's a cycle and a half they're pissing away. Apple can take that. Rod I really hope Google pulls an Apple someday. 5 years of support sounds great to me. Talos the Robot You are reviewing a defected phone with a red tint display and you are awarding it with editor's choice "Most Wanted" accolade, hahaha LOL.... francoism Still sure it'll suffer from the much staggered OTA updates. roverstim Seriously, no mention of the pink screen in the review ? Other OEM's would be picked up on this Rod This bothered me too, seeing as how evident it is. tim242 http://m.androidcentral.com/samsung-clears-air-red-tinted-galaxy-s8-displays Rod I'd like to see a pic of this review unit after calibrating.

Ash First official android with kernel version 4.4? dirtyjudo Cash me when it's time for security update. How bout dat? Daniel Tiberius System level EQ sounds neato. I'll have to play with that. Also I read that the Bluetooth to two separate devices feature comes with Bluetooth 5, or the processor and not from Samsung. Anyone know? Peter World Citizen It's best to read some reviews from Apple's love child: The Verge ... When the oppositions praise their main competitor's device then it must be really good. 1. http://www.theverge.com/2017/4/18/15328968/samsung-galaxy-s8-review-s8-plus 2. http://www.theverge.com/2017/4/19/15354444/samsung-galaxy-s8-big-screen-ergonomics 3. http://www.theverge.com/2017/4/18/15338052/samsung-galaxy-s8-touchwiz-android-software Anunnaki "At $750 and $850 for the S8 and S8+, respectively, there's no denying Samsung is asking a lot for the privilege of joining the Galaxy S club this year." It's at-least priced better than the Pixel. Jay I was interested in finishing the review until I saw that you tested it in 1080p mode only. I understand that the phone came with the setup initially, but that setting is what many people will want to use. Rod What's the difference, tbh? Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà I bet if I walked up to 100 S8 users and asked them if they changed the screen resolution to WQHD, 99 of them would look at me like I had broccoli growing out of my ears. Roberto Should have mentioned a killer feature that for once has been flawlessly implemented by big S development team, Dex. Rod Like all other reviewers, they'll probably do a DeX review when they get one. Lord Ravenor Good review. I'm not certain I agree with David on the size and placement of the fingerprint scanner, though: 1. I went to the shop yesterday and they had a display unit of the S8+ -- it is actually about as tall as an iPhone 7 Plus but a bit narrower (I held them side-by-side). The S8 seems to be about the same size as an iPhone 7, which I find too dainty. Now, I don't have big hands but I'm so used to my iPhone 7 Plus (I've had the bigger iPhone since the 6 Plus) that it's jarring for me to use something that's smaller like the S8 is. As an aside -- based on all the leaks, it looks like the S8 gives us a preview of what the iPhone 8 will be like in-hand. 2. The placement of the home button seems to be just fine. You can definitely train your hand, without too much effort, to place it where it needs to go so you unlock it as you pull it out of your pocket -- I don't expect it to be too much of an adjustment. I'd say that it's about the same as what I experienced with my Nexus 6P in the beginning, even though the 6P's button is recessed. That said, I can't speak for accuracy since it was a display unit and I obviously couldn't save try the scanner with it. The S8+ didn't have any perceptible lag but again, the unit I played with was a display unit that had what was probably a demo ROM SKU (I don't know why I forgot to check that). The unit felt good in hand, overall -- but weirdly, I liked the footprint of the Note 7 more because the S8+ feels like it's too narrow for its height. Then again, I'm used to the dimensions of the iPhone 7 Plus. If there isn't one already, I'm sure there'll be a 'stock' Nougat them in the Galaxy store. There were ones for the Note 5 so I don't see why there wouldn't be for the S8+ Stefan van Manen Its a great phone. Got it for almost a week now and I really like it so far. My major issue with this phone is the lack of stereo front facing speakers. Im coming from a Nexus 6p and I really miss that front facing speaker sound when playing games or watching youtube videos. Other minor things like the fingerprint location, useless bixby button and purple glare at the edge part of the screen don't bother me that much. Oh and first things I did was to replace the sammy launcher (the swipe up animation is soo laggy it hurts my eyes), switch up the navigation keys and install a pixel icon theme which made the switch from my Nexus 6p a lot easier. Railwayman I think it is fascinating with this Samsung fixation around the world. EVERY device from them with the magic Galaxy S name is... A WINNER! Same story every year.;) Every time this brand "wins" my dislike of them just grows bigger due to such things as carrier distribution/lock-in/branding, Knox 0x1 Warranty Void, Grace UX/TW, heavy modifications, developer unfriendliness, duplicated services (every Google service MUST have a duplicated Samsung ditto), mainstream design and so on. Even more annoying is the theory about the need for other devices to 'replicate Samsung' - i.e. that just because that brand do something with their design, EVERYONE is 'supposed' to follow to such an extent that it is perfectly 'logical' to bash products using arguments such as 'bigger bezels than the Galaxy S x' etc. Another issue I have with Samsung is their region SIM lock. i.e. that a 'local' SIM card must be used before the product is 'unlocked'. Samsung make technically good hardware but it is seriously crippled by their policies and vendor lock-in. I think it is fascinating that every test give them a passing grade despite those actions - even worse is when 'counter-articles' are written just because a Sammie is questioned like last year with the XDA Note 7 performance tests. "Samsung Central' felt it an obligation to immediately post an article about how useless benchmarks are.... What a 'coincidence'. I am very much unable to see how the Galaxy S8 can be the 'best device' in the market from a holistic perspective. There are way too many problematic policies, carrier BS and nonsense such as 'Knox is tripped, forget your Health and Gear VR' and so on involved and yes, those things just can't be compensated by the hardware. A very fast brick is... still a brick. A seriously locked in device with carrier BS (not to mention the value proposition it means) just can't be the 'best device in the world'. Galaxy S8 is first rate internals and display with third rate policies where the major ideology is 'My Way or the Highway! (The Samsung Way or Knox 0x1 Warranty Void and your fancy Gear VR in the trash!' Sorry to be critical but I am a bit tired of how a device can be praised year after year after year without any kind of holistic viewpoint where policies are important considerations. Teppka Have my Galaxy S8 plus on pre-order and ordered Thin Fit from Spigen a week ago as they ship internationally. Idea was to receive Spigen case by the time S8 plus arrives. They had two shipping options, DHL with 2 days delivery indication and USPS with no delivery estimation. So I paid $13 for shipping by USPS. After one week tracking stuck and keeps showing the package is in LA, Canada (Canada?!) . So I contacted Spigen for update and reply was that shipping will take 4-7 weeks. You've got it right, 4-7 WEEKS, which is about 2 MONTHS?! And they never even cared to specify this delivery estimation in the website. So the solution they offered me is to wait for a MONTH and if by the end of May its not delivered I should contact them and they will see what they can do. $13 for international shipping with 4-7 weeks delivery? Aliexpress sales cases for $3 including delivery and those delivered within a month internationally and you are informed about estimated delivery time BEFORE you choose shipping method. Spigen charges $13 for delivery and after you pay and item is sent you become to know that delivery is 4-7 WEEKS. I asked Spigen what am I supposed to wrap my Galaxy S8 plus into untill the case may or may arrive in 2 months but they do not really care and keep saying wait till the end of May. I was buying Spigen cases for over 5 years for my phones and am now amazed by their perfect customer service. Any suggestions what I should do? blairh Reviewers are not being harsh enough about the absolute garbage fingerprint location. That is a deal breaker for many. Then the S9 will fix this and reviewers will rejoice. tim242 You are dumb as dirt. Every single review trashes the fingerprint scanner placement. Rod He either edited the comment, or you're the dumb one here. tim242 Nope, it still says that reviewers haven't been harsh enough. That is a lie. Rod Maybe in his eyes they weren't as harsh as he expected? blairh Being critical has levels. Reviewers are not being harsh enough regarding this you prick. tim242 Yes they are. Now, you are a blocked prick. blairh You are such a loser. Michaels_28 I enjoyed Mr. Ruddocks' excellent review as always. He is one of the few whose opinion I can trust on the Internet. ASYOUTHIA‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà I am genuinely surprised that the S8 battery has lasted this long. Coming up on 8 hours SoT with screen brightness between ¬º & ¬Ω.

Now that Android Wear¬†is becoming a more mature platform, mostly thanks to the long-awaited 2.0 update, we're starting to see more watches than ever hit the market. It was fairly easy to compare Android Wear watches in years past - only a handful of tech companies even bothered. But now, a vast amount of wearables are being released, with most of them by actual watch companies. So how do they all stack up? You may notice some missing information below, especially from Fossil. We tried multiple times to reach out to Fossil for information on its upcoming watches, but we didn't receive a response. At a glance We've compiled a massive table¬†comparing every watch.¬†You can also look at it on Google Docs.

It's definitely one of the most feature-packed watches on the market, supporting every feature the OS does. It works with¬†Wi-Fi, LTE, NFC, and GPS - and includes a heart rate sensor and a speaker. As far as specifications go, it has a Snapdragon Wear 2100 CPU, a 480x480 1.38" circular display, IP68 water resistance, and a 430mAh battery. Unfortunately, battery life isn't fantastic, especially if you need to use LTE often. Be sure to check out our full review for more details, and you can buy it now from various retailers for $349. LG Watch Style Just like the Watch Sport, this was developed by LG and Google as an Android Wear 2.0 launch device.¬†The Style is much thinner than the Sport, but at the cost of features and battery life. It lacks NFC, LTE, GPS, and a heart rate sensor. The battery capacity is just 240mAh, which should only get you through a day of use (if that). The Style has a Wear 2100 processor, a round 1.2" 360x360 display, and IP67 water resistance. You can find our full review here, and if you want to buy one for yourself, it will cost you $249. Casio Pro Trek WSD-F20 If you need a super rugged Android Wear device, the WSD-F20 may be for you. Casio announced the watch back in January, and it just recently went on sale for a whopping $500. For that price, you're getting a speaker, Wi-Fi and GPS connectivity, and a 1.32" 320x300 display. However,¬†the WSD-F20 is missing quite a few important features. It doesn't have a heart rate sensor, NFC, or LTE. Also, it is one of the few 2017 Android Wear watches with a flat tire display. New Balance RunIQ New Balance released its first Android Wear watch earlier this year, the RunIQ. As you might guess, the RunIQ is primarily designed for workouts. It's powered by an Intel Atom Z34XX processor and includes Wi-Fi and GPS connectivity, a 1.39" 400x400 circular display, a 410mAh battery, and 5ATM water resistance. Unfortunately, the RunIQ lacks NFC for Android Pay, as well as LTE connectivity and a speaker. It's currently priced at $299. Huawei Watch 2 Why, Huawei? You were the chosen one! After the original Huawei Watch ended up being one of the best Android Wear devices on the market, many were excited for a newer model. Unfortunately, what Huawei provided was subjectively worse than the original - you can find our full review here. If you're still interested, the Huawei Watch 2 has a 1.2" 390x390 circular display, a 420mAh battery, IP67 water resistance, and all the connectivity and sensors you could want (including LTE). It's currently on sale for around $299, depending on the retailer. Huawei Watch 2 Classic The 'Classic' variant of the Huawei Watch 2 is probably closer to what most people were hoping for. It has almost exactly the same specifications as the normal Watch 2 - a Wear 2100 CPU, 1.2" 390x390 display, 420mAh battery, IP67 water resistance. However, it lacks the Wear 2's LTE support. The Watch 2 Classic is also $70 more expensive than the normal model, and shares many of its faults - small screen, no digital crown, etc. It's currently priced at $369 at most retailers. TAG Heuer Connected Modular 45 The award for the longest smartwatch name goes to the TAG Heuer Connected Modular 45. This watch has¬†an Intel Atom Z34XX processor (the same one the Casio watch uses), 1.39" 400x400 circular display, 410mAh battery, and speaker. As far as connectivity and sensors, it has¬†Wi-Fi, GPS, and NFC for Android Pay. It does not have a heart rate sensor or LTE. The Connected Modular 45 also wins the award for most expensive smartwatch on this list - you'll be shelling out $1,650 for the privilege of owning one. Montblanc Summit Similar to the TAG Huer, the Montblanc Summit is another luxury smartwatch. It has a Snapdragon Wear 2100 CPU, 1.39" 400x400 circular display, heart rate sensor, 300mAh battery, and IP68 water resistance. Unfortunately, the Summit is a bit light on functionality. It doesn't have NFC, LTE, GPS, or a speaker. Whether¬†or not that matters is up to you, but I expect the $890 starting price will drive most normal people away. GUESS Connect (2017) GUESS has made hybrid smartwatches with dot-matrix displays in the past, but this year, the company¬†released a proper Android Wear watch. It's available in two sizes - a 41mm for women (left) and a 44mm for men (right). The GUESS Connect has¬†a Snapdragon Wear 2100 processor but lacks NFC, LTE, GPS, and a heart rate sensor. The watch is expected to be released in Fall or Winter 2017 and will start at $300. Michael Kors Access¬†Grayson/Sofie Michael Kors announced two very similar Android Wear watches earlier this year, the Access Grayson (left) and Access Sofie (right). The Grayson looks more like a traditional men's watch, with an AMOLED display and a digital crown. It will be available in gold, stainless steel, and blue/black. The Sofie is primarily targeted at women, with a thinner case and a lighter feel than the Grayson. It has the same AMOLED display, but sadly¬†lacks a digital crown. It will have eight plating/bracelet combinations and seven interchangeable strap options. Both watches have a Snapdragon Wear 2100 processor and will start at $350. Misfit Vapor There are plenty of expensive products¬†on this list, but if you're looking for a good value smartwatch, the Misfit Vapor might be the best choice. It's¬†the second-cheapest Android Wear device on this list, at just $199, but it has¬†a Wear 2100 processor, a 1.39" circular display, water resistance up to 50 meters, Wi-Fi, GPS, and a heart rate sensor. However, I was unable to find confirmation that the Vapor included a speaker. Design-wise, the Misfit Vapor is definitely one of my favorites. It has a similar design to the Moto 360, but with a small bezel surrounding the screen instead of the 360's flat tire. It will launch in "Late Summer 2017." Diesel On Diesel's first Android Wear watch, the Diesel On, was announced earlier this year at Baselworld 2017. Hardly any useful information about it has been revealed, besides the fact that it uses a Snapdragon Wear 2100 processor and will have "hundreds of customization options." It looks like it has a digital crown, but we can't be sure. The watch will be available in "Holiday 2017," and will start at $350. Fossil Q Venture/Q Explorist Fossil's first Android Wear watch was released back in 2015, and the company followed up on it with two more in 2016. This year, Fossil is releasing the Q Venture and Q Explorist. Details on these are also incredibly sparse, but we do know both watches will have a Snapdragon Wear 2100 CPU and will be released in the Fall. It seems very likely that both watches have a flat tire display, as companies often try to use black watch faces in promotional material (such as the above image) to hide it. In fact, adjusting the brightness and contrast on the above image does reveal a flat tire. Movado Connect Movado's first Android Wear device, the Movado Connect, definitely looks sleek. It has an edge-to-edge 1.46" 400x400 circular display, a 300mAh battery, Wi-Fi connectivity, and NFC for Android Pay. However, it is worth noting that the Connect lacks a speaker, LTE, GPS, and a heart rate sensor. The watch will be available in Fall 2017, starting at $495. Hugo Boss Touch Another sleek Android Wear watch announced this year is the Hugo Boss Touch, priced at $395.¬†The specifications are identical to the Movado Connect - Wear 2100 CPU, 300mAh battery, 1.46" 400x400 circular display, and Wi-Fi/NFC connectivity. Just like the Connect, it's missing a speaker, LTE, GPS, and a heart rate sensor. You'll be able to buy it this Fall. Tommy Hilfiger TH24/7You This watch wins the award for the worst smartwatch name, but it seems to be pretty good at everything else. It has a Wear 2100 processor, a 1.4" circular 400x400 display, and a 300mAh battery. The watch does have Wi-Fi and NFC support, but lacks a speaker, LTE, GPS, and a heart rate sensor. You'll be able to buy the TH24/7You in the Fall for $299 - making it one of the more competitively-priced options on this list. ZTE Quartz At $192, the ZTE Quartz is¬†the least expensive watch on this list, barely beating out the Misfit Vapor. Currently exclusive to T-Mobile, the Quartz has a Wear 2100 CPU, 1.4" 400x400 circular display, and IP67 water resistance. It supports Wi-Fi, 3G, and GPS connectivity, but no NFC. There's also no heart rate sensor on the Quartz, but it does have the largest battery of any watch on this list at 500mAh. The carrier exclusivity is a bit of a bummer, but maybe we'll see an unlocked model show up in the future. Verizon Wear24 Verizon surprised everyone when it announced an LTE-capable Android Wear watch alongside the LG Watch Sport, undercutting the latter device in the process. The Wear24 has all the features of the Watch Sport, except GPS and a heart rate sensor (and possibly a speaker, Verizon hasn't confirmed that). When the Wear24 goes on sale, you'll be able to buy it for $349 outright or $300 on a two-year contract. It also remains to be seen how bulky the watch will be - that was definitely a problem for the Watch Sport, and Verizon hasn't released any photos. Conclusion We're starting to see more and more actual watch companies invest in Android Wear, which I see as a good thing for the platform.¬†Up until now, Android Wear has largely only been used by tech enthusiasts. I've seen plenty of people with Apple Watches (not as many as Apple would like, but still), but hardly anyone with Android Wear devices. Android Wear 2.0 in general is a bit of a mixed bag. While I personally don't mind the changes as much, others are much less happy about it, and for valid reasons. We'll have to see where the platform goes in the coming months (and years), but there is no shortage of watches to choose from.

Such a shame. Corbin Davenport That one was released in 2016. Dimitris Kanellopoulos Right. Sorry Raven ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà It might also have been released late 2016, but it is a shame that you did not include the Asus ZenWatch 3 in this comparison. I think it is one of the best Wear 2100 based smart watches currently available and at only $209 it is a steal compared to some of the ones listed here. I am loving mine. Tucker Sferro scrolling down the list, I am amazed at the prices. I loved my Moto 360 1st gen, I paid $100 for it on Craigslist. That's exactly what it's worth. You know why? The battery died after about 18 months and it's now a brick. The general public doesnt want to pay more than $150 for a secondary "cell phone-like" piece of hardware that only lasts 2 years, period. Smartwatches will NEVER take off until the cost point drops dramatically. This is the same thing that e-readers went through, until Amazon stepped up to the plate and brought the costs dow. Thomas Paulsen A fellow Moto 360 1st gen user here with a dead battery. I paid top dollar and it burned me so much that I am holding back from another purchase. The only reasons that I would reconsider are being able to open smart locks with NFC, robust assistant voice control ("open garage door"), broader Android Pay availability and - of course - a moderate price because we all know gadgets become obsolete fast. Tucker Sferro I found an article online that shows you how to replace the battery ($15), but it involved cracking the plastic off the back of the 360, etc. I would also be unhappy if I paid full price. Thomas Paulsen This video was posted two months ago and details the battery swap: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1as_h5jnBM Lazyboy0172 Oh I am going to be very sad when my battery dies. I've had my 360 since september 2014 and have no battery problems so far, but I'll be very sad to lose it. That's really the only thing that will get me to replace it though, because right now the thought of spending $300+ on something newer with the only real difference being that it looks better does not make sense to me. And I think that's the problem with the market right now- the price points just aren't there between manufacturers and consumers. Consumers do not want to supplement their $500 phone with a $400 watch, and then have to replace that watch every couple years. But no manufacturer can afford to sell a nice looking watch at <$150 and then also not have any repeat customers for 3+ years. Tucker Sferro you bring up a good point, that manufacturers are unable to bring the costs down to a more attractive level, which is why someone like Amazon (shudders) might be able to lower the cost with a Fire watch, or something like that. Oh boy, ads on my watch?! I just threw up on myself. brkshr Replacing the battery costs about $10 and 20 minutes. Kyle R Krcmaric I just want to have Android Wear at or below $150 on a device that supports Android Pay. GreatNews You forgot to include the all new ZTE Quartz https://www.t-mobile.com/internet-device/zte-quartz Corbin Davenport You're right, I'll be adding it shortly. Rorison Meadows II I need a camera on a decent sized one for video calling and photos. Come on people! marcusmarcus2 Here you go :) http://www.doki.com/ Daniel Nava Best Buy has the LG Watch Style for $170 right now. I picked one up and could not be happier with it. I just wanted a nice looking basic Android Wear watch under $200 and I got it. Matt It's a shame that Wear 2.0 is so bad. Roy ?WHY kamiller42 Oh. Where do I begin? 1. The watch is no longer an extension of the phone. This hurts the convenience of using the watch. 2. Apps that used to work no longer. Most times, permissions have to be granted again. Other times, the watch app has lost connectivity with the phone. 3. Notifications which used to appear don't. 4. It's slower than previous versions. 5. Theater mode in 1 click, 1 swipe, and 2 taps vs 2 clicks. 6. DnD no longer works. Why? Because Google wants the watch to act as an independent device. DnD on watch and phone are not connected. A handful of people say that's great, but the situations they bring up are edge cases. Most people, when they say "Do not disturb me" means do not disturb me at all. 7. I have not figured out to answer the phone from the watch. The only option I see is to refuse call. Used to be simple. Swipe right to answer. Swipe left to refuse. Roy 1. It's great. Only need good sync. 2. Wich apps? 3. Why not? All the reviews says it's work. 4. Mmm for sure now they need to upgrade the hardware for independent os. 5. What's for? 6. You right about that. 7. I didn't hear about that. So if I can Make a summary no everything work flawless so it's good that I didn't buy one just yet but it doesn't mean that Android Wear 2.0 not in good Direction. I hated the first version. Matt Why is that a shame or why is it bad? Michael Maggard ZTE Quartz came out in 2017, has Android Wear 2.0, and is under US$200. https://www.t-mobile.com/internet-device/zte-quartz Corbin Davenport Yep, I'll be adding it to the post shortly. Derik Taylor Also, the ZTE Quartz does have GPS. In the description, you said it doesn't. :| (I have it, which is the only reason I knew that.) marcusmarcus2 The discription also says it has NFC but I cannot see that it does on the T mobile website or the ZTE website. Derik Taylor Huh...didn't notice that. No NFC. :( Not that I planned on using it anyway, but still would have been nice as an option. abqnm I see it's on there now. There's a bit of an error though. In the blurb for it, it says there IS NFC but NO GPS. It's the other way around. It HAS GPS and NO NFC. The entry in the table is correct though. Thanks for this post. It's a great way to compare at a glance. Corbin Davenport Yep, some info got mixed when I was adding the Quartz and Wear24 at the same time. Both the table and the article text should be correct now. abqnm Thanks, but it's not quite correct still. The Quartz description now says but no GPS, LTE, or NFC It does have GPS, but not LTE or NFC. marcusmarcus2 Third time's a charm http://s2.quickmeme.com/img/1a/1ab37c4fc16eae0cf8505ad03c1652fea7659118ab91a6fa386c4e1e514266aa.jpg Corbin Davenport I clearly can't write today. Fixed! abqnm Haha no worries. We've all been there. marcusmarcus2 https://www.zteusa.com/zte-quartz "500 mAh" Dang, it has the largest battery compared to those listed and it still only has "up to 36 hours of battery life per charge" Kyle Gospodnetich Are you guys ever going to talk about the joke that is the Android Wear 2.0 OTAs? Most watches don't even have it yet, and Google completely backed down on their 'fast update, all at once' promise. Dan W agreed. i was hoping that AP would hold Google's feet to the fire on the 2.0 updates. they've been a tragic reminder of how little Google and its partners care about timely updates. Captain On! It's hard to forget, but updates aren't solely on Google. Manufacturers and driver support can hold software updates back regardless of Google trying to shove it out the door. EcE But since there was such promise, shouldn't have Google "certified" the watches somehow? Ensuring that the updates can be pushed timely? kamiller42 Google is doing you a favor. AW 2.0 is a work in progress. Its flow is not as fast and fluid as previous. me me Agreed, I tried the Developer Preview, Watch become unusable. Ambition >> specifications. Carson Saldanha When did they say "fast update, all at once" Mayoo Honorable mention to one of the longest tags section I've seen on AP https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4be9fae6b2e3863638bc20bd2881a3021302f2677608ddc958771313cae23baf.png PJ Anderson The LG Watch Style has a speaker? David Ruddock It doesn't, the table has been corrected. IcerC The Verizon Wear24 comes out in less than a week right? Add that one. tu3218 Has Verizon even announced a date yet? Still nothing on their website. Rashad May 11 tu3218 Where did you see that? Rashad I added the link afterwards. tu3218 Good deal. Although I'm really still waiting for the gear S3. But we all know how that's going for Verizon. Corbin Davenport Yeah, I'll add that one as well. YaKillaCJ The messed up part is the Misfit Vapor is the clear winner in terms of aesthetics and specs when not factoring price. Yet it's priced ridiculously competitive. I think I will get it to upgrade my Moto 360 1st Gen. victor sanchez same here. jawsnnn It will probably have some glaring flaw when it comes out. That has been the pattern for Android Wear devices so far: Announcement,Excitement,Dashed hopes and dreams. 005 anyone know if Misfit vapor has speaker if that has speaker that seals the deal all the way i can leave with out NFC for that price its hands down the best if only had spaker Corbin Davenport I found no mention of a speaker anywhere. 005 thanks hope they do because Huawei Watch 2 Classic went way down in design not sure what the heck happen ObligatoryEscapments It has 5ATM water resistance. In the Android Wear world, that means no speaker. (See: Casio, Nixon, Polar. All speakerless) i_say_uuhhh That Movado looks amazing, just wish it had a speaker and LTE. skillfulshoe Don't be fooled by that picture, it doesn't have an edge to edge screen. Not sure how AP missed that. https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/3/24/15052504/movado-android-wear-watch-connect-baselworld-2017 Roy THE CPU IS CRAP. marcusmarcus2 Really? I thought it was silicon. Roy Really why 28nm?! Stevie_Wonder The Misfit will probably be my first smartwatch. Might have some shortcomings, for example the lacking of NFC, but I don't think I will really need that since Android Pay isn't even launched here. Not sure if a speaker is really useful. And a question for the smartwatch users. My provider doesn't support a second sim so can't use the LTE option, but how useful is it and do you use it a lot? Will it connect through Bluetooth with your phone first and if that fails use LTE to connect? ObligatoryEscapments Casio is even stingier than Fossil with specs, but it's very surprising to hear that they've abandoned their custom SoC from the WSD-10 to use the Qualcomm. Also, I think it's a safe assumption the Verizon/Quanta Wear24 has a speaker. It's an LTE watch that makes phone calls. haberd I would love to see dimensions added. My major problem with this crop is they are too bulky for constant wear bƒÅbƒÅ ghan≈´j Full spec sheet for all Android Wear watches here! https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lbKhNnFBARrT5TVo3bkyp1UzT0S5Iahy3W9dAQf_sfc/edit#gid=0 ethd "The award for the longest smartwatch name goes to the TAG Heuer Connected Modular 45. This watch has an Intel Atom Z34XX processor (the same one the Casio watch uses), 1.39" 400x400 circular display, 410mAh battery, and speaker." I think you meant that it has the same processor the New Balance one uses. Your table and the article both say that the Casio Pro Trek uses a SDW2100. JD Seeing how Google Treats Android Wear. That's a big list of Casualties to add to the already long list of casualties. FlyOnTheWall No Polar M600? Corbin Davenport That was released last year. Akshdeep For ZTE Quartz in the table you have mentioned screen size as 1.4 and 400x400 but below you have written 1.3 and 480x480. Please make correction. Corbin Davenport Thanks, it has been fixed. Carson Saldanha The table says the LG Watch Style has a speaker, but I'm pretty sure it doesn't. Might wanna fix that ;) jmwils3 Haven't gotten any final news from Verizon, as the csms don't have the information, but the NFC chip on the wear24 don't seem to be active and no Android pay present, at least currently. Who knows if an update will activate them by official launch day, but the fact the original verizon article has been edited to remove references to NFC and the product page is gone isn't all that encouraging. Iagoba Apellaniz Compass? I want to see the ability to point to north Richard Markert I have both gens of 360, but I'm going to get a Gear S3 Classic for my next smartwatch. Not going to do another Wear watch. lcasale Can't even buy the LG Sport. It's been sold out on the Google Store and Verizon has pushed back the pre-ordered twice now (by two months). I'm expecting them to miss the latest 5/11 ship date as well. b_boogey_xl I think I'll go with the Huawei Watch 2 Classic. The only knock I have with it is, no LTE (not a deal breaker but‚Ä¶) and I wish they left off those notches that do nothing for a digital watch üôÑ. Don't really care for a digital crown since it doesn't have a greater function like it does on the Apple Watch, it just sounds like a "me too" feature. Now just to wait for the price to drop since everyone hates it‚Ä¶ üòä. peterfares You sure the Wear24 doesn't have GPS? I think it does. OrangeSweater Are you sure the Misfit Vapor has LTE? The only thing I see listed on the product page is Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity. It seems odd that it would include LTE when it is so much cheaper than what is available from other companies.

By Michael Simon Staff Writer, Greenbot | May 5, 2017 8:06 AM PT Credit: DARPA More like this Galaxy S8+ review: The future of Android is now The 10 best features in Android O (so far) Google cites progress in Android security, but patching issues linger Video Samsung DeX: The Galaxy S8 desktop dock really works We‚Äôre all used to hearing about how horrible malware is on Android, but a new report is the most disturbing yet. Security firm G Data is projecting that not only will new Android viruses and exploits reach new heights in 2017, but a new one will be discovered once every 10 seconds. But before you toss your Android phone in the trash, let‚Äôs explore how bad it really is. While 8,400 malware discoveries every day is certainly alarming, it‚Äôs important to know that they‚Äôre not coming from the Play Store. There are millions of Android phones around the world that connect to their own dubious third-party app stores, and millions more that side-load suspect apps to bypass paying for them through the Play Store, and that‚Äôs where nearly all of the 3.5 million malware instances will come from this year. But that‚Äôs not to say you‚Äôre completely in the clear. Android is the most popular mobile OS by a wide margin, and with popularity comes malfeasance. Android will always be a target for hackers, and as such, Google has taken great strides in Nougat and Android O to limit the chance that your phone could get infected. No Nougat There‚Äôs just one problem: According to the May distribution numbers, just 7.1 percent of all Android phones are running Nougat, less than the 7.5 percent that were running Marshmallow at this time last year. That means they‚Äôre not only missing out on some great features, they‚Äôre also behind the times when it comes to security. Many of the phones bought last year will never get the latest update, and even a brand new flagship like the Galaxy S8 is still running an OS that‚Äôs several versions behind. And while Google has set a new standard with monthly security updates that most manufacturers do a decent job with delivering, after a short while, those start lagging behind too. Even Google‚Äôs devices have a pretty short expiration date of just two years for version updates and three years for security patches, and right on schedule, the Nexus 6 and Nexus 9 are no longer being updated. It‚Äôs one thing to withhold certain new features that the hardware can‚Äôt support, but security updates shouldn‚Äôt have such a short end-of-life date. Microsoft has vowed to support Windows 10 through 2025, but if you buy a Pixel today, you already know that it won‚Äôt get Android Q. And that means it won‚Äôt have the latest security measures to fend off future malware. One step behind Android O brings a pretty major change to how outside apps are installed. Previously you only needed to flip a single toggle to allow your phone to accept installation of apps from unknown sources, but with Android O, it‚Äôs on an app-by-app basis. So, if there‚Äôs a malicious app on your phone that‚Äôs trying to muck up your system, it won‚Äôt be able to inflict any damage unless you give it explicit permission. Greenbot Android O makes you approve installations on an app-by-app basis, decreasing the likelihood of a malicious app. But most phones will never see Android O, including the Nexus 6 and Nexus 9 that were on sale just two years ago. Google is in a constant fight against malware on Android, but the struggle isn‚Äôt just against the attackers, it‚Äôs also over the delivery. Hackers love to target old exploits that people haven‚Äôt patched, and more than 90 percent of Android phones are at risk just because Android N hasn‚Äôt reached them yet. Better cooperation between Google and its major OEMs is essential to ensure that as many phones as possible are kept up to date with security patches. Most of the 3.5 million instances of malware that crop up this year will never get close enough to infect your phones, but it only takes one. And while you can certainly protect yourself by staying away from unverified sources, there's always the temptation to get that hot new app early or try out that cool APK that Google won't allow in the Play Store. And it would be nice to know that there's a proper line of defense in place in case one of them turns against us.

Pixabay Artificial intelligence may be one of the hottest trends in tech, but it‚Äôs still primarily viewed as a problem-solving tool. And while machines enhancing intelligence is great, the biggest gold mine will be AI‚Äôs conversational capabilities. CoverGirl recently learned this the easy way. Its chatbot from Automat Technologies and theAmplify reportedly enjoyed nearly 1,200 times more messages than relevant comments on social media ‚Äî and 1 out of 3 of those users bought CoverGirl products after engaging with the bot. If this kind of victory can happen in today‚Äôs early stage of chatbots, one can only dream of a future when the progression of chatbot sophistication is on pace with mobile devices. The Race to Conversational AI Is on Of course, companies are doing more than just dreaming of that future ‚Äî they‚Äôre building it. That story begins with AI infrastructure, such as Google‚Äôs AlphaGo. In a milestone for AI, it trounced a champion Go player last year and next will take on the No. 1 player in the world. Google is far from alone: According to Tractica, AI spending is expected to jump from $640 million in 2016 to nearly $37 billion by 2025. A domain known as natural language processing ‚Äî the capability for computer programs to understand human speech ‚Äî is at the heart of this race. According to MarketsandMarkets, natural language processing is expected to grow to more than $16 billion in the next four years. Such game-changing demand shouldn‚Äôt be a surprise. Anyone who‚Äôs ridden public transit while others gab away on cellphones knows: Humans love to talk. Unless you‚Äôre a Trappist monk, you probably spend more time talking and typing than anything else. But as students of foreign language can tell you, mastering conversational ability isdifficult, even for a human brain. Encoding the rules of language into software is much more challenging. For decades, we‚Äôve met computers on their linguistic turf ‚Äî and it hasn‚Äôt been pretty. For desktop users, it was check boxes, radio buttons, and mouse clicks. For programmers, complex code. Phone users? The dreaded phone tree (‚Äúfor English, press 1‚Äù). But since the 1950s, we‚Äôve watched science fiction movies and TV featuring people just plain talking to computers. Programs such as Apple‚Äôs Siri are leading the charge toward that vision, but there‚Äôs much more work to do, whether that‚Äôs in speech recognition, written-language processing, or a mix of both. And the results will open up new opportunities in so many areas. Considering the Possibilities A construction foreman who needs a quick update on the budget of a major project? Get rid of the spreadsheets; just ask the system. A CEO looking to forecast the next six months of margin on a product, given a tightening market due to a recent shift in fiscal policy? Don‚Äôt ask a chief financial officer or accountant; just whip out a smartphone and ask the new version of QuickBooks ‚Äî now equipped with conversational AI. From retail banking to pizza ordering, chatbots will accelerate the pace of commerce in the coming decade. As companies hone these products, it will unleash enormous potential for customers to empower themselves. Companies with tech solutions can easily integrate into existing AI structures, providing two-way streams of information. Google‚Äôs Assistant, Amazon‚Äôs Alexa, Apple‚Äôs Siri, IBM‚Äôs Watson and Samsung‚Äôs new Bixby are all powerful platforms that need third-party integrations to shine. While these tools are typically used for search functions (McKinsey & Co. estimates that AI can currently handle only about 5 percent of jobs), users increasingly want to ask them to perform more complex tasks. From ordering cars and food to making reservations and more, users are learning to trust these systems. Although there‚Äôs quite a crop of offerings to choose from, one of the newest, most exciting and possibly easiest platforms to get started with is the bot ecosystem that Facebook recently unveiled at the F8 conference. Facebook is doing a lot of the heavy lifting, building a massive intelligence mechanism that developers can tap into through its growing Messenger platform. There‚Äôs also a whole new crop of personal assistants to try ‚Äî such as Ozlo, Cortana, Hound and Jarvis. According to McKinsey, 20 percent of a CEO‚Äôs time is spent completing tasks that are so ‚Äúordinary‚Äù they could be automatic. Conversational AI is set to become as ubiquitous as smartphones, and savvy tech leaders know it. Those looking right now to integrate this tech into their operations at all levels will be well-positioned for this exciting new future. Fortunately, it‚Äôs easier than ever to begin that process, and because we humans love to communicate, it is going to be a fun ride.

Skip to content 512 Pixels About Projects Sponsor Book ‚Üí RSS ‚Üí Thoughts on That Rumored Siri Voice Canister¬† May 5, 2017May 5, 2017 ‚åò Permalink Rumors have it that Apple may ship its Echo and Google Home competitor as early as WWDC. The timing would be classic Apple: let the early players work out the kinks in the market, then come in with something you think is more nicely designed and works better than the devices that founded the category. No doubt a Siri Voice Canister would look better than the $179 Amazon Echo. I love how the slightly cheaper Google Home looks, but I found its touch surface to be a little lacking. A Siri Voice Canister carved of a single block of aluminum with a multitouch control surface? Sign me up. The other side of this isn‚Äôt as positive. I don‚Äôt think Siri works as well as these other voice assistants in some contexts. I rarely have my Echo misunderstand my words or misinterpret them, and Google is basically king of the hill here. Additionally, Apple‚Äôs reluctance to open Siri to more third-party services means its not as extensible as something like Alexa with its Skills program. If this product is real, I think Apple has to expand SiriKit into a much richer platform. The Siri Voice Canister will have to be able to work without a paired iPhone present. I‚Äôll be looking for that at WWDC, even if there is no hardware announced. In thinking about what physically goes into a product like this, its clear Apple has all the expertise needed. Networking, speakers and microphones are things the company understands. In fact, according to Ming-Chi Kuo, Apple‚Äôs product could be sold at a premium based on sound quality: We expect Apple‚Äôs first home AI product will have excellent acoustics performance (one woofer + seven tweeters) and computing power (similar to iPhone 6/6S AP). Therefore the product is likely to be positioned for: (i) the high-end market; (ii) better entertainment experience; and (iii) higher price than Amazon Echo. All of that feels right to me, but I still have some questions about what this product could be like if Apple really leveraged its ecosystem. The Echo and Google Home both fall back to a mobile app when they can‚Äôt deliver the results the user expects. Tap the Echo app on my iPhone, and you‚Äôll see a trail of every request it has heard, but the Echo itself will direct a user there when it can‚Äôt reply with voice: This is a space where Apple‚Äôs integration could really shine. Not only could this type of information simply show up on the lock screen of an associated iPhone, I think it‚Äôs be great for the Apple Watch to be involved as well. The Echo and products like it want to live in the kitchen. It‚Äôs a natural place a voice assistant. I can‚Äôt tell you how many time I‚Äôve spoken to our Echo while cooking or washing dishes. Having a Siri Voice Canister fall back to my Watch means information is just a glance away, even if I have my hands in the sink. Update: Several people have suggested Apple could just build this type of functionality into the next Apple TV. I think this is a flawed idea for a couple of reasons. First, most people don‚Äôt have an Apple TV in their kitchens, where these products are the most useful. Even if the Siri Remote would work from a different room of the house well enough for this, then your Siri Remote is constantly in the wrong place when you reach for it. Secondly, most people don‚Äôt leave their TVs on all the time. Would this Apple TV also have a speaker in it? Then you‚Äôre back to the first problem, unless the Siri Remote also gains a speaker, which would make it bigger and even worse than it is today. I just don‚Äôt see it. I think this is a separate device from the Apple TV.

Google Pixel long-term review: Still the best smartphone I've ever used David Ruddock Follow View All Posts 2017/05/02 3:28pm PDTMay 2, 2017 75 Plus 1 on G+ 330 Share on Facebook 120 Share on Twitter Total Shares525 News Phone Reviews Pixel Pixel XL Article Contents 1 The hardware 2 Battery life 3 Display, audio, and wireless 4 Camera 5 Performance and software 6 Value 7 Conclusion I have been using the Google Pixel XL for six months now. Not continuously, mind you - I have taken breaks here and there. But after using the Galaxy S8+, the LG G6, and the OnePlus 3T, there is only one phone I've instinctively found myself returning to, and it's this one. Google's Pixel isn't without its flaws; in fact, it has a great many I can cite with ease. The Bluetooth connectivity sucks. The back of the phone has very obvious wear rub. The glass window scratches easily. It's not waterproof. 'OK Google' hotword detection breaks for no apparent reason, necessitating a reboot. The fingerprint scanner is slower than what you'd find on a number of competitor devices. The value proposition is mediocre at best. The screen to body ratio pales in comparison to phones like the G6 or Galaxy S8. And you can't even buy the damn thing. Why do I keep picking up the Pixel time and time again, then? Am I just a brainwashed Google fanboy (don't answer that question)? The answer is consistency. In the nearly seven years I've been doing this, I have never used an Android phone that has held up so well to the tortures of time. The Pixel XL feels nearly as smooth as the day I began using it six months ago. Android glides along with best-in-class touch latency and a responsiveness that feels immediate (if not manic) and satisfying. It's not just performance, either. My battery life remains largely predictable, too, and largely very good. The camera continues to impress with its swift launches and ease of use, and it produces the most consistently excellent results of any smartphone camera I have ever used. HDR+ is easily, for me, the best smartphone camera feature out there. Oh, and even if the fingerprint scanner is a bit slow compared to some, at least the damn thing is easy to reach and reads consistently. Is the XL worth $770 to pick up today? I don't really think so, let alone $870 for the 128GB version we all actually want. And honestly, I have a hard time seeing the point of the smaller 5" model at $650 right now, that just feels like lunacy. The XL offers better battery life and is far from "big phone" status in terms of actual usability - it's really the only one of the two that warrants consideration, in my opinion. With that, let's dive in to the details. The hardware Put the Google Pixel XL next to a Galaxy S8+ and you'll have a pretty hard time finding much to love about Google's phone. 2017 is ushering in a new era of smartphone design language and packaging, and the Pixel XL clearly hails from the period prior to that shift. To be fair, it did come out six months ago. But there's no doubt that from an industrial design point of view, the Pixel is aging fairly rapidly. The 5.5" Pixel XL is nearly as tall as a Galaxy S8+, but the latter has a 6.2" display. Line up the bottom of the S8's screen with the Pixel XL's, and it becomes apparent just how much more panel Samsung has managed to shove into a frame that is only a few millimeters taller. Granted, this does have ergonomic consequences (the S8+ is unabashedly more difficult to use one-handed than the XL because of the screen's height), but I think it's safe to say most of us want more screen where we can get it. I still think the Pixel XL is perfectly nice to hold and like the texture of the aluminum opposed to Samsung and LG's new glass-heavy designs. I also still believe the fingerprint scanner is in the ideal location, unlike the Galaxy S8, which has the most frustrating one in existence. The position of the camera makes accidental smudging less likely, too, and I really like the perfectly flush look Google was able to achieve with the glass window. Visible wear lines on the casing In terms of wear and tear, my XL has... not fared well. The finish on the Quite black model I have here has begun to very noticeably rub off in areas where the aluminum chassis is slightly more raised than others. You could remedy this with a skin, but I personally like this phone totally unadorned. Otherwise, though, it's held up well - the buttons are still fine and I don't notice any real physical problems with the phone aside from the aforementioned finish wear. Just don't drop it in the toilet. Battery life As I said in the introduction, it's consistently good. I always have a pretty clear sense of how much time I've got left when I'm really starting to push my XL to the limits of its longevity. If I'm having a Wi-Fi heavy day with lots of using the phone for browsing the web and texting, 5 hours of screen-on time is doable. If I'm away from home and largely on LTE, I can pretty reliably get 4 hours of screen time assuming it's not stretched over much longer than a 12-hour period. For a full 16-hour day away from wall outlets and going it on mobile data alone, 3 hours is what I generally end up managing. This probably won't impress many of you with Xiaomi, Huawei, or Exynos-powered Samsung devices, and I understand that. But the thing about the Pixel has been just how well I've been able to learn what I can expect in terms of battery performance based on the conditions I'm using it in. I know I can throw in a bit of tethering and Bluetooth streaming without completely obliterating the battery, for example, if I'm at 60% halfway through my day and won't top up till later that evening. My range anxiety with the Pixel is exceptionally low, even if it doesn't offer the very best battery life of any smartphone. Would I like the next-generation Pixels to have larger batteries? Yes, please. Relying only on software to ensure a good power consumption experience is missing half the equation (and I'm not saying that's what Google did). Stuffing even a few-hundred more milliamp hours of capacity in there can be the difference between a dead phone and one that gets you back to the charger at the end of the night. Always fit a bigger battery when you can. Display, audio, and wireless The Super AMOLED Quad HD display still looks bright and crisp, even if the new panel on the S8 is clearly a cut above the part Google is using on the Pixel. Even so, I think the screen is one area where the Pixel XL earns its $770 keep, as there really aren't many phones out there you're going to find which are considerably better in this regard unless they have "Galaxy" inscribed on the back. On the audio front, I found the Pixel's bottom-firing speaker mediocre at the time I reviewed it, and I find it mediocre today. Sadly, it's not getting much in the way of competition, either - both the G6 and S8 have speakers that are at least as unimpressive, if not worse in certain respects, and I hope Google can at least give us that quasi-BoomSound using the earpiece speaker on the Pixel 2 this year. The headphone jack offers performance in line with most Snapdragon 820-series devices and thus isn't the best candidate for pushing your high-impedance cans, but I find it perfectly serviceable in the gym even at high outputs. The quality is there, even if this generation of Qualcomm parts didn't offer as much power as audiophiles probably would have liked. One of my biggest gripes about the XL is its Bluetooth performance. I have used three separate Pixel XLs, and all of them have absolutely terrible Bluetooth signal. Even think about touching the phone in the wrong spot, and the music stream to your headphones or car will cut out. It is absolutely obnoxious. It doesn't matter what kind of headphones, speaker, or car A/V unit - it sucks with anything I've tried. Even walking around with the Pixel XL in my pocket connected to a pair of Bluetooth headphones results in cuts every single time I step up a stair or rest my hand against the pocket the phone is in. The 7.1.2 patch has done nothing to alleviate this issue. It's borderline embarrassing: I have had the Pixel XL corrupt the Bluetooth profiles on my car three times. Each time, the only solution was to factory reset the infotainment unit. I had to factory reset my car. No other phone has ever done this to me, though since the 7.1.2 update this hasn't happened - yet. Wi-Fi performance, on the other hand, has been quite excellent for me, and LTE signal is at least as good as most other phones I tested in 2016. Now that I'm on Verizon, I'm even getting some HD voice calls, which is such a huge upgrade in terms of the call experience. But seriously, Google: get the damn Bluetooth right next time. Camera I can't stop taking pictures with the Pixel. I love this camera. No more words: just photos. ¬† ¬† Performance and software Aside from the aforementioned Bluetooth problems, you know what I find so wonderful about the Pixel? I rarely really get annoyed using it. Apps load up at consistently quick speeds, the OS always feels snappy and responsive, and the touch latency is positively iPhone-y. Like your finger is truly controlling the elements on the screen. The home button and back key respond lightning-quick, in a way that almost starts to make them feel like real buttons. I struggle to really convey how right Google got the basic "interacting with the phone" stuff here. What they managed to do with the Pixel will only make the Pixel 2 that much better a phone, and I will be clear: I do not feel this way about the Galaxy S8. The Pixel feels incredibly natural and pleasant to interact with. There are still hiccups, delays, and little areas where things just don't feel as smooth and seamless as they should on the S8. Google nailed this. No other phone I've used has. Is the Pixel as fast in a straight-line speed sense as a OnePlus 3T? No. But counting fractional differences between the number of seconds it takes to load an app or how long before it's pushed out of memory are not methods that convey an experience. They tell you a couple of very specific things under a controlled circumstance. In practice, I simply find the Pixel the most consistent and smooth Android smartphone I've ever used. But, it does have some usability issues. For one, my 'OK Google' hotword detection breaks basically once a week, necessitating a reboot. I use this when in the car, and so it's very, very inconvenient when this happens. Rebooting the phone takes a good minute-plus, and then it has to reconnect to my Bluetooth (which is never guaranteed to work). This is probably something to do with the Google app, but it's annoying nonetheless. Other than that? I struggle to find anything about the software that I really dislike. Most of my frustrations come down to third-party apps, not the Pixel. And those are annoying on any phone I use. Value When it debuted in October, the Google Pixel XL cost $770. The one you and I actually want, the 128GB model, cost $870. Six months later, the Pixel XL still costs $870. Is it worth it? Hah. No. The successor devices to the current Pixel family will be unveiled in the next five or six months. There is absolutely no good reason to shell out what, with tax, amounts to nearly a thousand dollars for this smartphone. You will absolutely regret it the moment Google announces the Pixel 2 - I guarantee you. Do not buy a Pixel right now. In fact, I'd say just don't buy a Pixel period anymore, we're just too close to the next iteration for that to be remotely sane advice. Conclusion So, that's weird, right? I can't even recommend that you buy what is easily my favorite Android smartphone currently on the market? What kind of long-term endorsement is that? That's because for all its problems and limited availability, the last six months I've used the Pixel have utterly proven to me that Google is capable of building a smartphone that, from a user experience standpoint, rises above the competition. Google's unmatched ability to optimize the way Android and the underlying phone parts interact is very much a reason I love this phone so much. A smartphone should get out of its own way when you use it - it should be an effortless canvas upon which your fingers and eyes naturally engage and interact. That means it should be fast. It should be consistent. And it should just feel right to use. I know that some of these things don't really translate well into concrete assessments, but there's something about the Pixel that really just works for me so well. It's as close to my ideal smartphone as I've ever been. I'm hoping that Google smoothes over some of the rough edges not just with the phone, but with the whole experience of buying and owning it. Why is is to hard to buy a Pixel? It's positively ridiculous just how bad Google has been at keeping this phone in stock. I also think it's hard to ignore that in 2017, the Pixel's design language and overall look and feel are clearly behind the competition. This looks like yesterday's smartphone, and even on the day it was announced it was kind of hard to really fall in love with in an aesthetic sense. At best, it's just kind of boring. Post-purchase experiences should improve, too. Google's online and live chat support are very-just-OK, and what I've heard of the RMA process hasn't been super reassuring - full price credit card holds and iffy-quality refurbished replacements. Of course, that's what happens when you're in the online-only phone sales business. Still, Google should be working to streamline defect, warranty, and accidental damage claims in a way that makes it feel like the nearly-thousand dollars you spent on your phone is going into supporting a thousands-dollar-phone experience. They really also need to stop making crappy cases that are obscenely overpriced. Google made a great phone when it built the Pixel. Now Google needs to be a great phone company. I'm curious to see if they can pull it off. Tags google pixel long term review google pixel review pixel long term review pixel xl long term review subscribe ...

My 6P is losing longevity and running super slow these days. Just can't bring myself to overlook the Samsung FP scanner or I might have settled for an S8. Tr3ple I'm warming you don't do it. I settled for a s7 edge after my 6p, big mistake OhYeah! I made that mistake with the Galaxy S3 and then the Edge 6. Both were disappointing and much worse than my Pixel XL. I love the Pixel! Dean L I got used to my S8+ fingerprint scanner after about a week. I absolutely love the position now, and never touch the camera anymore. Carson Saldanha Throw in free banana splits and you've got a deal! ;) Rickinbsb pick 2 Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà "My 6P is losing longevity and running super slow these days." I see people say all the time that it's Samsung phones that always get slow over time. Intellectually dishonest people, I guess. sweenish They can both be right, you know. Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà Yes, I believe they're both right, depending on various factors. My Note 4 is running better than it did with Lollipop, and a little slower than it did with KitKat. It probably has at least something to do with the Android version and what apps you install on it. My point was that it's intellectually dishonest to pretend it's a Samsung problem, as if it's unique to those phones. And that's how the people frame the problem. sweenish And you were just framing it as "not us, but them." Not better. If I misread your intent, I apologize. Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà You did misread my intent. No problem, though. Treeburgerface It's Android that's the problem. Some Android phones get slower than others. Some Android phones lag more than others. But eventually they ALL get slower and they ALL lag. I've heard 1000 people swear that Android is "silky smooth" and "fixed" now over and over again, before "project butter" and long after and it's still not true. It's certainly improved, which you should expect with the 3 Ghz 12 core processors and 8 GB of RAM they are packing in them now, but at this point I kind of doubt Android is ever going to be quite as flawless in the GUI department as other OS's which were designed to prioritize touch input and treat the users finger like God they way they should and which prioritize reliability over ultimate capability. Just depends which set of sacrifices you are more comfortable with. Ismail Akram Well that totally sum up a perfect phone for me :) Just add Powerful AMP in that Ghisy This, times a million! And also a cheaper, not overpriced XL with at least a 5.7" screen. Then Google can have my money. Meanwhile, I'll be keeping my Nexus 6P. Rod "My 6P is losing longevity and running super slow these days" I don't get this. How is it running super slow all of a sudden? Did you fry half of your board or something? My 3 year old phone performs exactly the same way as when I first unboxed it. Try running in safe mode, because there's probably a rogue app in your end.

When you lose consumers to me that's not good business! Either have them in stock or lose money! senor_heisenberg It's a Google product, so I'm not even surprised. Just a weird company. ericshmerick Yesterday: don't buy this POS Today: I love this phone lulz Daishi And in both articles he said not to buy the phone. It is advice. He explained himself quite well with several caveats. His point is valid. There is no real reason anyone should buy this 6 month old phone for its introductory price, even if the phone had no flaws. Bob Thank you. Rod You should. However, you'll need to time travel back to the launch day. Tr3ple Incoming triggered Sammy fanboys.... OligarchyAmbulance "WUT?!?! What do you mean your Samsung lags? Mines *never* lagged! It runs as well as the day I bought it, you *obviously* have a defective unit!" username_not_valid I feel the need to factory rest a device several times a year anyway, Samsung or not. David Martrano Totally agree, my edge has never lagged. Purchased over a yr ago. Just as fast as the day I bought it. Plus with the Nouget update even better! deadpenguins My fiance's gs7 is less than a year old, yet it *constantly* lags and hangs up. She has to restart it at least once every few days and has to charge it twice a day even though she barely uses it! See how useful anecdotes are? OligarchyAmbulance Woosh Jermell Howard Jr Lol funny and true but lets be hone st Google in the Smartphone world is like France and Samsung is like the U.S. Jeff Beck I'm not sure who that comparison favors. Jermell Howard Jr The U.S is a world superpower and France is not. Samsung is much bigger in terms phone market share Winston But Samsung doesn't have a loud CEO who tweets in all caps during his morning bowel movement. Jermell Howard Jr üòÇ ok? King_Android üòÇüòÇüòÇ xyz Yeah, they just have a better education and healthcare system, and higher quality of life statistics. But America does have a lot of big, shiny bombs. I'll give you that. Marty Nah, still not biting. Me no like HTC. "I have a hard time seeing the point of the smaller 5" model at $650 right now, that just feels like lunacy." I'm one who prefers a smaller phone. Had Apple included an FHD display on the 4.7" iPhone 7, I'd be sporting one with a Cheshire Cat grin. RyRyTheFunBun I think that Apple did the right thing by sticking with just an HD display on the 4.7. Good density with less of hit on battery. But if they wanted to make the phone thicker.. rockon999 I just bought one. Honestly David, 6 months is a long time to wait to buy a new device (Pixel 2). My Moto X is done for and I wanted a good phone. What can I say. At least I don't use Bluetooth and don't mind cases... Paladin27 I just bought one... 4 weeks ago and got it yesterday. Great timing on these two articles, AP. :-/ BUT, My Nexus 6 is dying and I needed something new. I weighed the options, my wife even has a G6, but I'm glad I got the Pixel XL, and besides, it will be 8 months before anyone actually has a Pixel 2 in their hands. whispy_snippet I wouldn't worry at all. Both of you. You got what in my book is still the best phone you can get. Not the best in every single way, but the best in the ways that are arguably the most important. JDC Great article @rdr0b11:disqus. Fair and balanced. I feel the same way about my Pixel. I also have the fun time of explaining to friends and family why my Pixel is the best Android phone I've used BUT they shouldn't buy one. I personally can't wait to see what improvements are made to the Pixel 2. mwolverine I have an OP3T, and one thing i don't get is how is the user experience on the pixel superior? Both are running nearly stock Android and are very consistent. Tr3ple You'd be surprised how much better the Bexel XL actually is compared to the 3t. Granted the 3t is the best bang for the buck out there. Duder12 It's more fluid and smooth. What don't you understand? Ismail Akram Have you used Pixel for yourself for month or for a week? I had OP3(not T) and came to Pixel XL. One thing very obvious to me when switching was smoothness between the two. Pixel animations feels more natural. and scrolling feels so smoother, its not massive difference and normal users can't even tell the difference, until he have used so many phones. then Software update thing is really awesome on Pixel. Camera is best for me on Pixel. Display is also great. In term of looks I prefer OP3 more. well IMO if Pixel have better design it would be even better for me. BTW I hear people have a lot of issues with OP3T touch latency which OnePlus improved but not gone. people don't even notice these latency things until they use phone with less touch latency. Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà Given that you admitted many (but not all) of it's faults, if that's the best phone you've ever used, you've set the bar incredibly low. crackcaffeine You sound like you know a lot about this topic. What is the best phone you've ever owned? Inb4 Note 7 Grahaman27 "It's the best smartphone ever but don't buy it!" Which half of this is bullshit? Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Neither, if you read and understand the context. Grahaman27 A new phone probably launching in 6 months (that we know nothing about) is not a valid reason to not recommend buying a phone. Tr3ple It's an opinion you know? Jarrett Lennon Kaufman If that were the only reason he stated in the article, I might agree with you. Again, read and understand the context. MJ Did you consider reading the article and trying to understand the words? Suicide_Note I'm just grateful i haven't experienced any issues with the Bluetooth on my XL. Keith Stefanec Me neither. Sean Me either CF542 You guys are lucky. I'm on my second Pixel and still have Bluetooth issues. Not as bad as the first unit but still a problem. Love the phones‚Äã though Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà I frequently see comments by people who say they're on their 3rd or 4th Pixel. It makes me wonder how many of those 2.1 million Pixels HTC shipped are replacement phones. David Martrano When the day comes when they sell 50 million pixals, please let me know. It's a great phone for a limited audience! Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà "Limited audience" -- I couldn't have described its fans better than that. Tom Takumi Okamoto Google should buy OnePlus to improve them as a phone maker. NexusKoolaid How did that work out for Motorola? Tom Takumi Okamoto Not well. I don't think Google wanted to be a phone maker at that time because the Nexus program was still on. If I'm not mistakin it acquired Motorola just to protect Android from lawsuits. Knowledgeborn Allah The entire basis of your argument kind of falls apart when you admit that you can't recommend for anybody to buy it, and I think that's because of the Pixel's main problem: it's overpriced, underpowered, and unsustainable on Android's current platform. The fact that it'll be DOA by 2019 just makes it worse. Could I recommend that people buy the Pixel XL right now (if they could get their hands on one anyway)? Nope. Could I recommend that OnePlus 3T? Yes, definitely! The S7 Edge, which is OLDER than the Pixel? Yes! There was even an article I read today with reviewers STILL recommending people to buy the iPhone 6s Plus to save money, and that device came out 2 years ago! When compared to those devices, the Pixel just doesn't hold up, which is why I don't think anybody would recommend it today, only 6 months after its release. Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà They expected to sell 3 million by the end of 2016 and 7 million more in 2017. HTC has shipped about 2 million since it was released over 6 months ago. 'nuff said. whispy_snippet Can you provide references for these assertions? OligarchyAmbulance The reference would likely be his anus. Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà Google "htc shipped 2.1 million pixels". For comparison purposes, Sony shipped a total of 5.1 million Xperia phones in Q4 2016. And that was a drop of 33% year over year. whispy_snippet That's not a reference. That's some words inside double inverted commas. Tr3ple https://www.google.com/amp/m.gsmarena.com/google_has_already_sold_21_million_pixels_report_says-amp-24270.php whispy_snippet Thanks for this. But it only states the amount of Pixels sold, being 2.1 million. I haven't seen a reference where Google officially states "they expected to sell 3 million by the end of 2016 and 7 million more in 2017." A statement like this sounds like horse shit to me. There's no way Google would be foolish enough to make a specific target like this available to the public. In other words, Felonious Monk is almost certainly bull shitting. Again.

Once again, nowhere does it say Google "expected to sell 3 million by the end of 2016 and 7 million more in 2017." He's bull shitting because that's what a bull shitter does. Tr3ple Google never said that, that's your boy up there paraphrasing. Either way they predicted the phone to sell quite a lot. And it is. whispy_snippet He's not paraphrasing. He's manipulating information, being deliberately misleading, and bull shitting. Completely. Tr3ple "Digitimes Research's Taiwan Mobile Device Tracker - HTC's handset shipments are expected to reach 6.5-7 million units in the second half of the year, up less than 10% from 5.8-6.1 million units in the first half." whispy_snippet So is the digitimes research device tracker establishing projected figures based off their own analysis or from direct statements from Google and/or HTC? OligarchyAmbulance So you know how many phones Google expected to ship because you made it up and it's now a fact? lol Alright, buddy. Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà Android Authority: "Report: Pixel shipments could hit 4 million this year" (2016) "Morgan Stanley: Google on track to sell 3 million Pixel devices in 2016, 5-6 million next year" Google it for yourself.

Maybe by the end of 2017 they'll hit the projected sales target for the end of 2016. Randy Gindy Where were your sources? Randy Gindy Xperia is a pretty well known brand already in several markets. The Pixel brand hasn't had much exposure aside from the couple models of developer oriented Chromebooks and Tablet. I wouldn't assert that because an established brand sells better than a brand that just really started that it makes it a bad phone. Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà Xperia is a great example of a failing phone in the US, at least, which is why I used it as a comparison.

Tr3ple Just shut it, ill recommend a pixel over all these phones you mentioned, s7 egde won't get anroid P, I can guarantee you that. Until you've owned and used a pixel XL you shouldn't comment on it. tim242 It is HTC trash. Tr3ple Yeah we get it, you don't own one. tim242 Why would I? Hardware issues galore. Not to mention, the stock problem. Tr3ple Lol as i thought, move along. tim242 Deflect much? It is well documented trash.

Richard Dennis Yea... yea.. we know you're here you're queer get used to it.. Next! Safe circles, safety pins, and pink hats for everyone.. (Paid for by the government of course) tim242 Damn str8! Knowledgeborn Allah Fanboyism at its finest... The Pixel is not a good buy compared to any of those phones, and I DO have the Pixel XL. I know from experience that it's overpriced, underpowered, and unsustainable with Android's current system. ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è The S7 Edge probably won't get Android P... And? Based on the chart just released (scroll up), most other Android devices probably won't get Android P either, at least not until "Android R" is out. Lol! Tr3ple Judging by what you said I doubt you have a Pixel XL. Yes it's overpriced, just a lil. If somebody don't care about the price, yes pixel is definitely a better buy Knowledgeborn Allah What kind of sense does that make? It's a "better buy" if you don't care about the price? üò≥ Like I said, it's overpriced for what it is. Tr3ple yes plenty of us don't care about the price, it makes plenty of sense. Pfft Knowledgeborn Allah The idea of being a "better buy" contextually includes the price. The fact that the Pixel is overpriced for what it is automatically means it's not a good buy. And again, that's coming from somebody who bought the XL variant at launch. Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà The OP3T and Axon 7 are much better buys. Knowledgeborn Allah Absolutely! Tr3ple No, the idea of "better buy" is a combination of EVERYTHING. Software, camera, build quality, reliability etc.. and let me tell you that the pixel is in fact t the better buy, only phone on that list I think MAYBE might be a better buy is the 3T, but the camera and battery life are ok not great, but for the money yes. Knowledgeborn Allah Yes, everything, INCLUDING the price. Again, the fact that it's overpriced means, contextually, that it's not a good buy. This shouldn't be that hard to understand. whispy_snippet I don't think it's over priced at all. Knowledgeborn Allah You don't think it's overpriced, being identical in price to the iPhone? I've heard other people make that claim, and yet they believe that the iPhone is overpriced... What's your view regarding this? Do you think the iPhone is overpriced? What does something being overpriced mean to you? whispy_snippet I guess I should rephrase. It's not over priced when compared to what it's competing with. "Over priced" is a bit of a relative term. It doesn't hold a lot of meaning. What is over priced to one person might be a steal for another. I think you can make the argument that compared to other phones the Pixel, iPhone and Galaxy S8 are all expensive. But over priced? That's a murkier discussion. Knowledgeborn Allah I agree, but I think status plays a role in pricing when it comes to other manufacturers. Samsung and Apple both have established brands, and people are willing to pay top dollar for their devices because they've already proven themselves. Google isn't in this same position in the smartphone hardware department. Also, I'd say that both lines - e.g. Galaxy S series and iPhone - offer much more in the way of unique features and premium hardware than what Google offers with the Pixel. But that's just my personal perspective... whispy_snippet See that's where I'm not so sure. The Pixel still has the best camera of any smartphone and an amazing display to back it up. Straight away it's hit two areas out of the park that matter to most people. At launch it had a class leading SoC that continues to offer great performance. It has plenty of RAM. Rock solid build quality. A super fast and accurate fingerprint sensor. USB-C (remember the GS7 didn't which was Samsung's 2017 flagship) with fast-charging and excellent battery life. It has the most capable voice assistant. It's got the latest version of Android and what I believe to be the best overall user experience for most people - it's consistently fast and smooth, unlike anything from Samsung, and will receive timely updates for much longer than the competition. The Pixel is the iPhone of the Android world and I think it has a market to fill. Do I think the Pixel 2 needs to be better? You bet. No one is denying this. What phone doesn't need to be better than its predecessor? If the Pixel 2 doesn't at least have waterproofing and a higher display-to-bezel ratio critics will hold them to account. But I'm pretty sure these features are a guarantee. The thing is, and I've said this elsewhere, I don't really consider a lot of the hardware bells and whistles we see from the likes of Samsung all that meaningful. The curved display is a gimmick. It looks great, but I'm not at all sold from a functional perspective. The same with the new 18:9 ratio. For a mobile device I consider one handed usability important. Reaching the notification pull-down with one hand is already a no-go on the GS8 and its fingerprint sensor is another ergonomic mis-step. And a heart rate sensor? Who on earth uses this? Same goes with its iris-scanner and face recognition. Why use these options when a well positioned fingerprint sensor is more convenient? It's all just guff. Bullet points for carrier salespeople to sing about in store. I think waterproofing is a biggie though. Google can't drop the ball here. I also think wireless charging is going to become significant if Apple introduces it to their new iPhone. We've seen Google offer wireless charging in the past and then take it away because, well, I don't think that many people really cared. But I sense the tide is going to turn on this. Google's phone is priced the same as the iPhone and Galaxy S because it's being positioned as a premium product. I hate the word "premium". It's huge BS when you really think about it. But ultimately this is the strategy Google is taking with its new phone. A high margin, high performing, premium flagship for the masses. I think the best of the Pixel line is yet to come. Knowledgeborn Allah I also think the Pixel launched with a lot of good qualities and features, and that's why I rushed to purchase it. However, around the same time, I bought an iPhone 7+, just to give iOS a fair shot. Now that I've used both devices, I think it's a huge mistake to call the Pixel "the iPhone of the Android world". In reality, it doesn't even come close, and that's where the problem comes in. The iPhone is Apple's primary device when it comes to sales, but it can almost be seen as an accessory to other Apple devices, like the Mac and the iPad, etc. The Apple ecosystem allows all their devices to work together seamlessly through Continuity, and this is something Android can't replicate (at least not at this point in time). The Pixel may look similar to an iPhone, but it definitely doesn't function like one. And yes, I know that Samsung (and carriers) puts a bunch of bloat on their devices, showing off features that many people will never use. The difference, though, is all about opportunity and selection. Samsung built an entire brand around giving their consumers more than they'll ever ask for, and that's what keeps those customers coming back. I don't know anybody who uses that heart-rate sensor on the back. When I see it, I think, "Why wouldn't they remove that and use the idea of the heart-rate monitor to sell more Galaxy Gear smartwatches?" I just didn't get it... But, hypothetically, if somebody ever ends up in a situation where they need a heart-rate monitor, Samsung has them covered. I learned that firsthand when my nephew was taken to his school nurse due to an asthma attack, and the nurse didn't have a heart-rate monitor in her office. Her assistant pulled out his Galaxy S7 Edge and used the heart-rate monitor on there to relay it to medical services when they arrived. I know, that would be a generally rare occurrence, but it happens from time to time, enough for people to consider what would happen if they didn't have it. Personally, I don't think Google has enough "skin in the game" at this point to really charge that much for the Pixel. Apple and Samsung have proven brands in the smartphone space. Tech reviewers giving it high marks isn't going to matter too much among average consumers, because most people just aren't interested in technology to that extent. They just want something that works, and works reliably. Google hasn't demonstrated the ability to make hardware that just works reliably (unless you count the Chromebook Pixel line, which most people didn't buy either). It's always better to start at the bottom and work your way up, than to start at the top and get knocked all the way down. Sean Everyone on here KNOWS you dont have a Pixel or a Pixel XL......but troll on......... Knowledgeborn Allah "Everyone on here" knows what I have? Seriously? You're an idiot. üí© Knowledgeborn Allah I find it quite funny that anybody who criticizes the Pixel is automatically labeled a troll, a hater, a sheep, etc. How ridiculous! ¬Ø_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà After Marshmallow, I stopped caring about new Android versions. I'm almost afraid to get a Nougat phone, given there have been so many problems with it. As for O and P, I'll let you Pixel users alpha test it and then decide if I care about getting it. Knowledgeborn Allah üòÇüòÇüòÇ I actually bought the Pixel XL mostly because I've had every Nexus device since the Nexus 4. I thought it would be a great device, but I was disappointed. It's not horrible, but it's definitely not worth the price. And, to be honest, I haven't really used it consistently in months. I use it occasionally to access the Google Play Store, but that's about it. My primary device nowadays is an iPhone 7+, and it's miles ahead of the Pixel XL in almost every way. Alex Louderback "DOA by 2019" is a contradiction, my friend. Knowledgeborn Allah If we're talking about release timeframe, you're right. But there's a big difference between when a device is released and when it's in the hands of the consumer. Last time I checked, the Pixel XL variants are still out of stock, even though nobody's buying them. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman DOA means "dead on arrival," which was Alex's point. It can't be DOA by years from now. Knowledgeborn Allah That's cool and all, but that's not a counter argument... OK, maybe "DOA" wasn't the best terminology, but the points still stand. The device, today, 6 months after its release, is still too flawed to recommend. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Stop comparing it to an iPhone. No other Android phone should be purchased six months after its release either. Only iPhones have that status because they have no competition within themselves. Within Android, after six months, there's another king of the hill. But I wouldn't recommend a Galaxy six months after its release, or ANY other model of Android phone. Knowledgeborn Allah "Stop comparing it to an iPhone"? üò≥ Google released the Pixel devices to directly compete with the iPhone! If they can't do that, then why are they matching it in price? If the product is devalued already, then Google needs to drop the price. Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà Put a fake button on the huge chin and it would look exactly like an iPhone. That's no accident. Sean You and Knowledgeborn Allah should have a troll off competition.......... Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Because your point has NOTHING to do with the Pixel, and EVERYTHING to do with Android as a whole. The reason the Pixel's not a good value proposition at this point is because it's competing against all other Android phones, which together are competing against the ONLY iPhone. You can't compare them in this regard. Period. Also, there's no point in comparing them because if I wanted an iPhone I'd own an iPhone. I don't. In which case I'm determining the best Android option. Right now, someone who isn't buying an iPhone, shouldn't buy a Pixel. That has nothing to do with the iPhone and everything to do with the competition in its own space. Knowledgeborn Allah That's not true. Every Android device isn't designed to directly compete with the iPhone, but that's exactly what Google tried to do with the Pixel. So, yes, they can definitely be compared. Just because the Pixel doesn't stack up doesn't mean that it shouldn't be compared. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Android, as a whole, is designed to compete with the iPhone. While the Pixel has to compete with both the iPhone AND all of Android. "Just because the Pixel doesn't stack up doesn't mean that it shouldn't be compared." You're not reading or comprehending my words if THAT was your takeaway from what I said. Not bothering anymore. Knowledgeborn Allah Android as a whole? Android is an operating system. Its rival is iOS. You're positioning the platform as if it's completely one-sided. The iPhone has to compete with various Android devices too. It just happens to have an ecosystem of hardware to aid it along the way. You're acting like an Android OEM can't do the same thing if they put in time and resources. Based on the fact that Android manufacturers are only pushing out hardware components for smartphones (and occasionally tablets and smartwatches), I'd say their biggest competitors are other Android OEMs, not Apple and iOS. For the record, the LG G6 wasn't designed to compete with the iPhone. It's competing with the Galaxy S8. The HTC 10 was competing with the G5 and S7. It's never been an Android vs "Apple ecosystem" thing on the manufacturing level. The only OEMs who actively try to compete with the iPhone are Samsung (S and Note lines) and Google (Pixel line), and it looks like Huawei is just starting to build up their consumer base in the West to do that too. The others are generally competing against other Android OEMs. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Your first paragraph made my entire point for me: Android manufacturers', including Google, biggest competitors are one another, *not* Apple and iOS. But ANDROID's biggest competitor is iOS, which has only ONE device line: the iPhone. The Google Pixel, while it may have been designed as Google's attempt to battle the iPhone, doesn't exist in a vacuum. It's still ALSO doing everything from the first paragraph: competing against all other Android manufacturers. No matter how much Google may *want* to break out of that, their wants are irrelevant to reality. And the reality is that the Pixel is one of many Android phones, all of whom are competing against one another, the sea of which is competing against the iPhone. So how well the Pixel stacks up against the iPhone isn't relevant, as it's not the focus of this article or the reasons for David's position. WITHIN the Android ecosystem, it's simultaneously the best Android phone he's ever used (same here) and not a good idea to buy it right now BECAUSE OF THE REST OF ANDROID and NOT for any reason having anything to do with the iPhone. For anyone who wants to buy an iPhone, which is a massive number of people, there is absolutely no competition, allowing them to charge anything they want. For anyone who wants Android, there's an endless sea of competition, making the Pixel's price and specs within the refresh cycle a much harder sell right now. Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà The headline is, "Google Pixel long-term review: Still the best smartphone I've ever used" not the best Android phone. I assume he meant Android phone, though. Still all smartphones compete with one another. And if the Note 8 is disappointing, I'll definitely consider getting an iPhone 8. Because the best smartphone (for what I want and need) is what matters to me, not the best Android phone or even the best (insert OEM here) phone. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Cool. We have different priorities, which is fine. I couldn't use an iPhone. Apple products and their ecosystem don't fit my needs. So I'm looking at *only* Android phones. So it's entirely a matter, at any one time, of what the best *Android* phone is. Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà I thought I couldn't use an iPhone, too. But I've used an iPhone 6S Plus now, and it's really quite a good phone. Even the display is better than I thought it would be. And that's quite a compliment coming from someone (me) who will never use anything but AMOLED. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman I have to use them for my clients sometimes. They're fine. They work well. I'm still too embedded in Google's ecosystem in ways that don't make switching feasible. Knowledgeborn Allah I get your point... I still think there are certain ways around that, especially considering Google's vast amount of resources. But yes, I see how that could definitely be a problem. They could still salvage the Pixel line, though, by providing standout features like Samsung does, or by undercutting their competition with their pricing like OnePlus does. I think either of those could work fairly well. The notion of putting standout features in their devices could be a challenge, since their devices pretty much serve as a template for Android as a whole. Undercutting the competition would be easier, and that's what Google actually did for years with the Nexus program. I think that's the big "bust" factor for them. If the Pixel could be purchased for $450-500, it would still be a good purchase even now, just like the OnePlus 3T. But it's really hard to justify paying $800 for the Pixel while the Galaxy S8 and G6 are on the scene. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman They already went for standout features. They made a big push to be more "opinionated" with several software and UI customizations, along with their big hardware push. The difference is a huge number of the Galaxy standout features just aren't that compelling. That's the sort of stuff they skipped. Knowledgeborn Allah When I mentioned standout features, I was talking about exclusive ones. The Pixel doesn't really have any. They marketed the phone as having the "best camera on a smartphone", and that's turned out to be a debatable subject among people depending on their perspectives - whether they like realistic colors or oversaturated photos. The Google Assistant is now available on pretty much every Android phone, just like the fingerprint scanner gestures. The hardware from the front looks strikingly similar to the iPhone -which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it leads people to question why they should get an iPhone lookalike, when they can get the real iPhone for the same price. The display is decent, but it's not even as good as the one on the Galaxy S7. Google ditched stereo speakers for a mediocre mono speaker. Pixel Imprint is noticeably slower than the fingerprint sensors on many cheaper offerings. The Pixel launcher was all the rage, until pretty much every third-party launcher started adding many of its features into their custom launchers. To make matters worse, the device is almost always completely out of stock online and unavailable to purchase through carriers. And those are just basic factors. Add to it the fact that Google just published an EOL report for the Pixel, solidifying the point that it'll stop getting Android OS updates in less than 2 years from now, and people are going to say, "F**k that!" That's why, personally, I think they should drop the price and salvage what's left, unless they really don't care about selling them. whispy_snippet Price and value are not intrinsically linked with "premium" products. You don't just drop the price on a product you're trying to position as high end because it's gotten a little older. You're only going to tarnish its reputation. A major reason why many people buy high end premium products is BECAUSE they're expensive. Marketing 101 mate. Phones are modern day status symbols. I remember when the Pixel launched some people scoffed at the price and said "well I'm just gonna wait for Google to discount it in a few months". I tried to tell these people that it wasn't going to happen and that the best "bang for buck" time to buy the Pixel was actually launch day. And here we are, months later, and the Pixel is still being positioned as a high end premium product. And believe me, it'll still be priced at the high end right up until the Pixel 2 launches. Apple have long been the masters of pricing their products at the high end of the market despite cheaper alternative offering features that savvy buyers demand. But look how well Apple has done. Billions of dollars in the bank thanks to sales in a product often considered a step behind the cutting edge. If you want a cheaper phone with certain features important to you, get one. There are countless options. But give up on the idea of a cheap, affordable Pixel. It's NEVER going to happen. Knowledgeborn Allah I'm not disputing that. You're correct in saying that many people buy high end products because high prices give the illusion of inherent quality. The problem, however, is that the Pixel is competing against the iPhone, and it hasn't worked. In fact, it can't and won't work. There aren't any Android OEMs who can realistically compete with Apple. They may design devices that compete with the iPhone, but they can't compete with Apple. Why? For starters, continuity. When you buy a Pixel device, you're buying a product. When you buy an iPhone, you're buying into the Apple brand and ecosystem, where all their devices, ranging from the Apple Watch to the Mac to the iPad, iPod Touch and Apple TV, and even AirPods and Beats wireless headphones, all work seamlessly together. Secondly, you're buying into the Apple Store and it's customer service benefits. Thirdly, you're buying into Apple's update cycles, which come directly from Apple to all their devices instantaneously and average around 4-5 years of support. The list goes on and on. Google isn't naive. They have their own ecosystem, but it's centered around their software and services, which you can get on practically any device. They don't have a hardware ecosystem. They knew what they were getting into, and they took a chance by trying to compete directly with the iPhone in pricing. They also see that it's clearly not working, so it's time for them to adopt a new strategy. If they actually want large groups of people buying their devices, which I'm not entirely sure they do, they either need to have standout features like Samsung Galaxy devices (which they don't), or they need to lower their prices. Right now, lowering the price on the Pixel is the only way they can salvage it. whispy_snippet I disagree on many levels. You don't establish yourself as a hardware company overnight, and you don't establish a product's premium reputation overnight. Yes, Google doesn't have the same hardware ecosystem Apple has at this stage. But they've now got skin in the game that matters most - phones. All of the products you listed from Apple don't come close to the significance of the phone. Many will never own an Apple TV, a MacBook, or Airpods. But almost everyone owns a phone - and we don't know where hardware is going to take us next. Maybe in a few years time tablets will be dead, everyone will be using hybrids and home assistants will be one of the most important gadgets in our lives. Who knows? The point is just because Google doesn't have the same suite of products as Apple doesn't mean they won't one day, or that they won't be the company that leads the pack in the hardware that matters tomorrow. Further to this, just because the Pixel lives in an ecosystem different to the iPhone doesn't mean it can't be a success in its own right. Google is known for its class leading services. What happens if it starts gradually making these hugely important and much loved services - like Google Maps, Google Drive, YouTube, Google Photos... even Google Search - Pixel exclusives? It sounds improbable - almost impossible! But it serves as a reminder of how powerful and influential Google is in the services EVERYONE uses, Apple customers included. Google entered the hottest fight in consumer tech and delivered a hugely impressive smartphone on its first attempt. It wasn't perfect, but it bettered the competition in a number of important ways. Who knows what Google has in store for the Pixel 2, 3 or 4? They're in this for the long haul. You can't expect the Pixel to sell like the iPhone and Galaxy S in its first, second or perhaps even third iteration. But as time goes by, the Pixel will stand shoulder to shoulder with Apple and Samsung's best in the minds of the average consumer. There's too much at stake for Google to sit this one out. Knowledgeborn Allah I think you're missing my point... I'm not saying Pixel can't be a success. It definitely can be, but Google needs a better strategy to make that happen. When you're competing against a company that has a structured, proven hardware ecosystem that seemingly locks users in, you have to do something extraordinary to break them out. Samsung is doing that by releasing groundbreaking smartphones. OnePlus is doing that by undercutting flagship devices via pricing. What's Google doing? The idea that Google has leverage because of their services is naive at best. Google isn't going to make their services exclusive to the Pixel or its brand because they make too much money from their portals. If they restricted YouTube to the Pixel, everybody would switch to Vimeo or something else, and Google's stock would plummet. The same goes for pretty much all their other services too. The only leverage they have is in financing, and that's very comparable to Apple anyway. In fact, I think Apple may actually be worth MORE than Google at the moment. In reality, Google will never try to conquer the hardware space. Services are their moneymaker, and the more devices they can attach their web services to, the better it is for their bottom line. That's what it's really about, at the end of the day: money. The Nexus program was more popular than the Pixel, even though there was far less advertising for it, because Google implemented a strategy of undercutting their competition. They probably thought that meant people just loved their devices and decided to launch a "premium" product. In reality, one of the main selling points of the Nexus line was its affordability. The Pixel doesn't have that, and that's why it's not selling. Again, they need to undercut their competition in pricing, or they need to implement standout features that are exclusive to the Pixel. I see those as the only sure ways to salvage the disaster that is the Pixel line right now. whispy_snippet Maybe grab yourself a cup of tea... ‚ÄúI think you're missing my point... I'm not saying Pixel can't be a success. It definitely can be, but Google needs a better strategy to make that happen. When you're competing against a company that has a structured, proven hardware ecosystem that seemingly locks users in, you have to do something extraordinary to break them out. Samsung is doing that by releasing groundbreaking smartphones. OnePlus is doing that by undercutting flagship devices via pricing. What's Google doing?‚Äù But is Samsung making ground breaking smart phones? Is Apple? No one is doing anything especially impressive at the moment. A larger display is a nice to have, and I've no doubt everyone is going to follow this trend, but it's not what I'd call ‚Äúground breaking‚Äù. The same applies to hardware features like wireless charging, stereo speakers, or dual cameras. All nice to have, but merely extensions of core concepts of how we use our phones. So what? I think Google has a unique edge through its ability to leverage its vast swathes of data and machine learning to create personalised services that no one else can. They‚Äôve been leading the game in key areas of software and services for many years now. That‚Äôs not to say Google is perfect of course, but take mobile photography for example. With the Pixel, Google was able to enter the phone market and best the competition first go through software expertise. And look at Assistant. It‚Äôs way ahead of Siri despite Apple getting the major head start. Google Chrome is the leading web browser. Google Maps is the leading mapping service. Google Search is so dominant in our lives that it spawned the phrase ‚Äújust Google it‚Äù. Smartphone hardware has just about reached conceptual maturity but software and services are absolutely ripe for further innovation. And if I had to bet on which company has the greatest potential to revolutionise this space I‚Äôd bet on Google. Not Apple, and definitely not Samsung. ‚ÄúThe idea that Google has leverage because of their services is naive at best. Google isn't going to make their services exclusive to the Pixel or its brand because they make too much money from their portals.

The only leverage they have is in financing, and that's very comparable to Apple anyway. In fact, I think Apple may actually be worth MORE than Google at the moment.‚Äù Of course Google isn‚Äôt going to flick a switch overnight that takes all its services away from non-Pixel users. I‚Äôm not suggesting this would be any sort of sensible strategy. But it‚Äôs not hard to see Google making certain features of these services Pixel exclusives as a first step. Let‚Äôs picture ourselves a couple of years from now. Hypothetically speaking, what if Google started giving Pixel users access to ‚ÄúYouTube Sports‚Äù for free? Or what if they gave Pixel users 2TB of Google Drive storage for free? Or what about unlimited uploads to Google Photos for free? ...wait, they already do this. What about exclusive access to the Google Assistant? Wait, they did this too in the launch stage of the Pixel! Can you see what I‚Äôm getting at? In the coming years, as the Pixel gains further traction in the minds of the general public, Google will be better placed to leverage its strengths and make the Pixel a value proposition no one else can offer. Imagine all of the above I‚Äôve listed, and more, only available on the Pixel? Google has a huge advantage on the cloud service side of the equation - an advantage that I think is going to prove increasingly valuable in the coming years. ‚ÄúIn reality, Google will never try to conquer the hardware space. Services are their moneymaker, and the more devices they can attach their web services to, the better it is for their bottom line. That's what it's really about, at the end of the day: money.

I see those as the only sure ways to salvage the disaster that is the Pixel line right now.‚Äù Google is trying to conquer the hardware space right now. Chromecast, Chromecast Audio, Google WiFi, Google Home, the Pixel, Daydream, Chromebooks, the hiring of Rick Osterloh as SVP of hardware - there‚Äôs evidence of Google‚Äôs push into hardware everywhere. But you don‚Äôt usurp hardware empires like Apple or Samsung with the click of the fingers. This is a long game, one that is going to rage for years to come. If Google continues to develop the Pixel at the same rate it‚Äôs developing its services (and by all indications this is Google‚Äôs intention) its phone will be a formidable force sooner than you think. The unrefined, ‚Äúrushed‚Äù gen-one Pixel won critical acclaim from tech sites and bloggers everywhere - for example Android Police, The Verge, and MKBHD all rated the Pixel one of the best smartphones one could buy when it launched. Labelling the Pixel line a ‚Äúdisaster‚Äù is as laughable as it is bizarre. Clearly it‚Äôs selling well as Google is having huge trouble keeping it in stock. And yeah, part of this is because Google is botching its supply train, but teething issues were to be expected. The message to take home from these issues is that there‚Äôs a demand for Google‚Äôs first phone. It is selling. Not at iPhone or Galaxy S levels, of course. Not yet. But anyone with a reasonable appreciation of the smartphone industry never expected it would. But I would definitely expect the Pixel 2 to sell better than its first gen sibling. Onward and upward. You‚Äôd be foolish to underestimate the second most valuable company in the world. Knowledgeborn Allah You're making some really good points... But I highly doubt Google is not trying to conquer the hardware space. They may be merging themselves into the hardware space, but dominating it? That kind of growth would eventually make them a virtual monopoly! They'd be shut down before they reached that point. There can be groundbreaking features of a device without them revolutionizing the way we use our devices. Based on your presentation, the only groundbreaking device on the market would be the BlackBerry KeyONE, since that literally changes the way someone would use their smartphone, at least a modern one. And, by the way, I'm not calling the Pixel a disaster in and of itself. I'm talking about its sales figures when compared to its competition. It's a pretty good device. I've had several issues with mine, and it's been far from perfect, but it's definitely not horrible. However, money is what matters at the end of the day. It's priced in the same range as the iPhone and Galaxy devices. Yet, it hasn't sold in numbers even remotely comparable to either of those. That's what I meant by it being a "disaster". whispy_snippet Apple has long dominated hardware. Why wouldn't Google aspire to be in this position one day? Why would Google be stopped when Apple wasn't? If Google sees an opportunity for growth that they're confident they can exploit they're almost obligated to go for it and provide returns for investors. Google may not ever reach a dominant position but I've no doubt its long term goal is to dominate. Just on the Pixel's sales figures, I'd reiterate that looking at gen one sales compared to the iPhone or Galaxy S is pointless. It really is. It's certain that many people still don't even know that the Pixel exists. What we need to keep an eye on is its growth. Will the Pixel 2 sell more than the first gen Pixel? Will the Pixel 3 do the same again? Will this growth be at the expense of Apple and Samsung market share? Just watch this space. I'm expecting it will definitely keep doing better in the years ahead. But it's going to be a fight. Knowledgeborn Allah I also think that the Pixel will see growth, year over year, at least initially. It's not going to be easy, though, regardless of Google's resources, because they're still going up against Samsung in the Android space. Personally, I think Samsung is going to crush the Android smartphone space for years to come, and there's not much Google can really do about that. The competing spaces, at least right now, are reserved for iOS and Android, and Samsung has gotten the dominant position in Android to become Apple's biggest competitor in the smartphone space. It took them years to get there, and I highly doubt they'd let that position be handed over to Google. The Pixel will be in a better position to secure the dominant position in the Android space if Samsung decides to start using their Tizen OS. Until then, Google will be fighting an uphill battle against Samsung, and they'll pretty much always lose. whispy_snippet We'll see won't we. Knowledgeborn Allah Indeed. Daishi Stop comparing it to an iPhone. Interesting point. When it comes to pricing the Pixel(s), they shouldn't be priced like an iPhone. Google doesn't have the nationwide support systems in place like Apple does. This is an argument for Apple's pricing for their phones. Why should the Pixel be priced as such without the same services??? Jarrett Lennon Kaufman They're at nearly the same level of services. Warranty replacement was intensely simple. Pricing is what it is. I can't argue it one way or the other. Reason was primarily to appear to be in the same class. It's psychological, and there's merit. But the entire point of this article was NOT that the iPhone is the better buy, which is why the comparison makes no sense to make. Daishi How are they at the same level of services? Of the 490 Apple stores in the world, the United States has 269 of them. Each offers not just sales of Apple merchandise including Macs, iPods, iPads, iPhones, Apple watches and Apple TVs, but service them at each one as well. This is the level of services I am talking about. Where are all the Google Stores where I can take a Pixel phone for servicing?? Google does not have this level of support anywhere in the world, so why should they price their gussied up Hold This Cat 10 phone like an iPhone??? Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà Because it was designed to look like an iPhone to make people believe it was worth what you'd pay for an iPhone. And it has G on the back. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Because, again, the warranty replacement process *without* a store is insanely simple. Simpler, since Apple generally requires you to rely on a store, and there are massive swathes of the country not near them. Also, you left out the word "nearly" to support your strawman counterargument. They're NEARLY at the same level. Also, you're lumping in unrelated things. We're talking about the Pixel, not the entire Android ecosystem. What other devices Apple supports through a store is irrelevant. And you can bring your Pixel to a UBreakIFix store for support, as well, FYI. Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà They're out of stock because nobody is buying them. I've seen comments about how they can't find them at Verizon stores. That's because Verizon only stocks phones that they can expect to sell. That's basic business sense. Knowledgeborn Allah That makes a lot of sense... But what about the online Google Store? Google won't even make them available to purchase online, as if HTC isn't even making them anymore. Kevin Aaronson Goddamn, those Bluetooth issues sound nightmarish. I would loose my mind! QueenLuLu So much this!!! I completely agree with this article. I currently have a Pixel, OnePlus 3T and LG G6 and despite all the great qualities the other phones have, I find the Pixel to be the most enjoyable and "complete" Android device I've ever used. And believe me, I have pretty much used them all! I want so much to love my G6 more, but it's impossicant. Better specs or no; the performance and be usability of the Pixel is awesome! I really hope Google steps up with the Pixel 2. If they did, I think it would really give this industry the kick in the rear it needs. whispy_snippet Great read as always, David. But I'm just wanting to ask some questions on the Pixel's Bluetooth performance. Is this just based off your own personal experience or have you got some data to indicate this is a widespread problem? I own a Pixel and use Bluetooth all the time. I listen to podcasts and music over Bluetooth headphones on my daily train commute, I sometimes use my portable Bluetooth speakers outside when I'm having a BBQ or a coffee on my deck, and my 2017 Subaru Impreza has Android Auto - which as I understand uses Bluetooth to transmit audio. Has there been the odd hiccup? Sure. But on the whole Bluetooth performance with my Pixel has been perfectly fine. No stutters, no disconnections, no nagging drop outs and relatively quick connection times. Obviously this is just my personal experience, but if I'm reading your review correctly, the problems you mention seem limited to your experience also. Maybe your accessories and not the phone are the main culprit? I just think Bluetooth sucks in general, personally. Taco Monster At least with my Mazda 3, my wife's Z3C is much much more reliable than my XL, which craps out a lot (see my other comment on this thread). I've found it to be okay with speakers and BLE devices like our August lock. whispy_snippet Hmm I'm a little sceptical about Mazda and their reputation for mobile consumer tech. They're still not officially onboard with Android Auto and Apple Car Play - instead they're still pressing their notoriously buggy and clunky MZD connect in-house system. I'm speculating, but they seem a bit "head in the sand" if you ask me. thetimmysmalls They recently announced Android Auto and Apple CarPlay to come to most of their Mazda Connect systems... At some point. whispy_snippet Yeah I did see that. Promising. But we'll see. Brian Wolters When the Pixel first came out, it would often lock up and sieze my car stereo system to the point where I actually had to turn the car off for 2 minutes and then get it back on. It was frustrating to say the least. With the recent updates to the Pixel, I've not encountered this. whispy_snippet Nasty! What car do you have? Brian Wolters 2016 Jeep Cherokee with Uconnect. It hasn't happened since recent updates. It was so bad, I used another phone until it was known it was fixed. My name is‚Ä¶. Damage control??? Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà Google could draw a picture of a phone in crayon and sell it as the Pixel XL 2, charge $1,200 for it, and most web magazines would rate it the best phone of 2017. It's self-preservation. And then once you've done that, you can't admit you were wrong. That would not only be embarrassing, it would be biting the hand that feeds you. Tr3ple But do you have one Johny M It's called Appleing it. me me It's the 7 stages of grief after the Nexus 5. Wondering when the press stop writing words about the once-was-interesting Google products. Keith Stefanec Never experienced any of these Bluetooth problems that were mentioned. Single downward speaker sucks. Hopefully, the Pixel 2 will have a bigger screen like the Nexus 6. wjrandon Did you Google make you guys post this? I bet they did!!!! Taco Monster For your Bluetooth woes in the car, at least with my Mazda 3, force stopping Bluetooth Share under Apps does the trick for me. I've even set up a Tasker profile to do this automatically every 12 hours. üò§ I figured this out after resetting the car to factory settings a couple of times. Grey I think these phrasings are disingenuous. My Nexus 6P is the best smartphone I've ever used - it's bigger, it's thinner, it's faster (though I am currently sucking all the RAM out of it and it's constantly freezing up - but my Nexus 4 did that too) than my Nexus 4. That doesn't make it a phone I'm happy with. There's features missing I'd like to have. There's design choices I disagree with. Saying "This is the best phone I've ever used" doesn't at all mean "This is a great phone". Jeff Beck When you have used pretty much every mainstream Android device ever, as David has, it's not a bad compliment. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman ...it kind of does mean that, actually. Unless literally every phone you've ever used is utter crap. But considering who's writing the article, he's used pretty much everything. "Best phone I've ever used" does translate to "this is a great phone." 4Ui812 That picture is so apropos for the title of the story. (If you don't know what I'm trying to say you can ask) brenden gonzalez Loved the article David I agree I got the the pixel from Verizon pre-ordered it and got it the day before I went on sale I've recommend the pixel to everyone I know my parents switched to them my brother and sister did to and I got some friends to switch to it as well and we all love the software experience it's so amazing!! Best phone I've ever owned it's also the longest I've ever owned a phone in 2016 before the pixel came out I had 6 new phones in a year and never did I find one that I liked and wanted to stay on I've tried them all to HTC to Samsung to even apple and LG and sony and I can't put the pixel down! I can't get a new phone even after seeing the s8 I would recommend and buy a pixel any day over the S8 Plus I no like edge on screen hell no!!!!! I would break it and be mad so that phone is too breakable for me! Nigel Antonio I kinda agree, accept I haven't ever gotten any bluetooth issues, i've been in a case since day one, and I don't see wear and tear on the back panel.... I recommend this phone to everyone, but don't go buying it now unless you have an extra 1k burning a hole in your pocket then go ahead.... but I await the next version of the pixel xl 2017, should be dope. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman A few thoughts/counters, in both directions, from my own experience: 1. I have had NONE of these Bluetooth problems you described with any device, including several different headsets as well as my car. I can travel notable distances from it, work out with it, and no disconnects. BUT, I have a Pixel, not an XL. Could that somehow be a factor? 2. Warranty service, for me, was exemplary. Yes, there was a credit card hold, but I'm used to that for advance exchanges. Otherwise it was a 10-minute process via chat, the replacement arrived in two days and was flawless, and thanks to the overall Pixel backup/restore process, the transition was painless. Easiest warranty exchange ever. Also, she allowed me to decide, on my own, to skip going through a factory reset as we both felt I'd done enough of my own troubleshooting. 3. Now the bad one: my Pixel freezes on me semi-regularly. On the one I replaced it was sometimes several times a day, but on the replacement, after about two weeks of use, it's as much as once a day, as infrequently as once every two days. Full-on hard freeze necessitating holding the power button until it reboots. NOT good. Never had this happen before or anything like it on a previous phone. Clearly, if it survived the warranty replacement, it's an app causing it. But how can an app consistently freeze up the entire system to this degree? What's not preventing that? And why is there no easy way to troubleshoot that? This is really bugging me and is the only thing damaging what's an otherwise stunning, stellar phone that's my favorite of all time. Only other disappointment for me is not having an XL which is what I wanted at launch, but the store approved me for just under enough money to get a 128GB XL. I had to choose between 32GB XL or 128GB non, and 128GB was (and still is) more important to me. But I'd rather have the better battery life and higher-res screen for VR. Still, all-in-all, and especially if I can resolve the freezing issue, this is the best phone imaginable, and its limitations are nothing compared to its heights. But yeah... at this point, wait for the next one if you're buying a phone now. Toby Beveridge I have the 5" Pixel with the daydream VR headset and I don't have any issues.. the screen is good enough for me.. way better than my note 4 or s6 Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Cool. Not for me. The pixel density is a serious problem for my enjoyment. Ismail Akram I have bluetooth issues he mentioned and I use Airpods with my Pixel XL.. so I thought its Airpods problem with Android(cuz I rarely use that with iPhone) About freezing it happened to me when I was on beta but after beta I don't remember freezing on Pixel XL ( but it was annoying in the start and I was so dishearted ) I recently had to sell either iPhone 7+ or Pixel XL (so I can buy S8+) and I sold iPhone 7+ :-p cuz iPhone is so easy to get Niall Murray I have the same freezing problem. Often my phone will unknowingly reboot in my pocket too. gizak No BT issues here either and I use BT in my car and headphones daily. As for your freezing, I experienced this too... after some extensive google searching, I narrowed it down to an app or two causing it. Mainly, any older app that uses your GPS periodically to poll for your location. Check apps that use GPS and haven't been updated since the latest version of Android, they may still be accessing the GPS directly instead of asking the android system for location (the newer more efficient way). Wendy By "latest version of Android", do you mean any app that hasn't been updated to Android 7+ software? My phone has been freezing every few days or so, so I'd like to try this suggestion. Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà Are you talking about the Pixel? I'm curious if these apps freeze other phones with Nougat. Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà Wouldn't this mean that every other phone running Nougat would freeze up when running these apps? Have you heard of anything like that? gizak Hmm, ya, you would think so. I'm not a code monkey, so this was just a hunch. The forums I came across linked it back to a family locator app causing the freezes and mentioned GPS access as the culprit. For me though, it was the WebMD allergy app that periodically polled my location to provide pollen count that froze my Pixel up daily. When I uninstalled it, my freezes seemed to go away. Wendy I'm getting the freezing error as well. I've requested for a replacement, so I'm hoping that will solve the issue. It's been freezing every so few days or so, not as frequent as yours. motoridersd The only odd Bluetooth issues I have had with this phone are related to it turning off randomly, and it has only done it a handful at times since I got it 6 months ago. I can put the phone in a drawer, walk into another room at the other end of my house, and I get no audio dropouts. Works perfectly fine in the car too. The only time I've had annoying dropouts has been in crowded airport terminals where there are a ton of competing 2.4 Ghz signals interfering and I have the phone in my pocket on the opposite side of the receiving circuitry of my BlueBuds X. Even then, it's a quick blip and it returns. Bluetooth IS much worse with The Dash, but that thing has its own issues and it happens with any other Bluetooth device I use. Maybe the BlueBuds X just have great performance that make up for the Pixel's shortcomings. Jordan I have the regular Pixel 32GB on Verizon. I have had absolutely none of the issues you describe, though Bluetooth is weak, in that if myself or my dog are in the direct line of sight between the device the speakers/headphones, it will cut out. But I have had no issues with the bluetooth in my infotainment in my car (my S6 & S7 did make me reset it a few times, however). Other than the locked bootloader (-_-) it is the perfect device! whispy_snippet A friend asked me the other day whether he should get a Pixel. I said yes. Most "normal" people don't want to wait around for months to see what the next processor is, or whether the screen on the next generation of phones has a slightly better display to bezel ratio, or whether the fingerprint scanner is going to be on the front or back. They just want something that has all the apps they use and works well. The Galaxy S8 has more hardware bells and whistles than the Pixel, but if history is any indication, the Pixel is going to be much nicer to use over the life of both devices. And ultimately, user experience trumps everything if you ask me. Especially for the non-techie. King_Android And it's a good thing they don't read the AP site either. David is speaking to his audience i.e. us nerds, not normal every day consumers. disastrousrainbow Exactly this. Having worked at Verizon for many years, giving Joe Consumer the tech enthusiast viewpoint on why they shouldn't go with a phone that's a few months away from being replaced rarely worked. More so if they were replacing a damaged or lost phone. In a situation like that, I would wholeheartedly recommend the Pixel over any other phone right now point blank dot com. Even with the S8 out. Of course, this would only be the case if they said they wanted, say, the best camera around. Or wanted a reliable software experience, etc. Those keywords would instantly bring the Pixel to mind, and I wouldn't feel bad about sending them off with one because 9 out of 10 times when the next model comes out, they will really not care, especially if their phone is still working well. When it comes to your every day man, it's not the tech enthusiast you should be listening to when recommending something, but rather the needs of the person you're trying to help. Midnitte "When it debuted in October, the Google Pixel XL cost $770. The one you and I actually want, the 128GB model, cost $870. Six months later, the Pixel XL still costs $870. Is it worth it? Hah. No." Google is insane if they think a phone holds on to value that long. Considering all the high profile phones that have released after it, you'd think they would consider a price cut. MJ You have never taken an economics class huh? Supply and demand ring a bell at all? Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà That's why you can't buy one. No demand, no supply. MJ I think have seen you troll enough on AP now. BLOCKED Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà LOL!! K77bkny Loooool people getting emotional over this bullshit device.... https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/649f431458908833d91263af6250ee8fbce01c1c6c9d7ca37827b1f65883a97e.gif Midnitte Six months sounds more like supply chain problems, not supply and demand. It's absolutely ridiculous that we're months away from the Pixel 2 and the Pixel 1 still costs $870 in the face of the Galaxy S8 and G6. Like the article, why would anyone recommend the Pixel 1 at $870 today? MJ It is a supply chain problem but that's irrelevant. The fact is the supply is not meeting the demand. Why would Google reduce the price on the phone? People are still buying it at that price regardless of what David, you, or I think about it. Cowboydroid After using a Pixel for several months, it is an insanely overpriced device. The only reason I own one is I got a great deal on it. Comparable performance and hardware can be had for less than half or even a third of the price. Sean People who write such things NEVER actually have a Pixel and are just haters. Those of us that actually have a Pixel (or XL) think they are superior to any phone we have ever owned........thanks for playing. Tr3ple You're so right about that. Cowboydroid Writing this from a Pixel XL right now, fanboy. Why get so emotional about a device? Debanjan Chowdhury I have been using alot of smartphones‚Äã. I used the OnePlus 3t, Nexus 6p, iPhone 7 plus, and even I have received the galaxy s8 plus yesterday. And I can surely say pixel xl will still be my daily driver. I am not a fanboy. I always support which works best for me. Yes, if Samsung had opted for a better camera, bigger battery and better fingerprint scanner position, I would have changed my daily driver to s8 plus. Good camera, snappy performance and stock Android are the priorities for me. And my pixel xl gives me all of these things. The Samsung galaxy s8 plus still has just little bit of hiccups here and there. But pixel xl, smooth 60fps all the time. And receiving updates at the earliest and it's unique update system works amazing for me. I would be really happy if it was water resistant. But I can't change my daily driver for only one benefit because pixel xl provides me dozens‚Äã other benefits than my Samsung galaxy s8 plus or s7 edge and‚Äã my iPhone 7 plus. Ismail Akram I had Oneplus 3 and I found Pixel XL to be more smooth and feels better than Oneplus. beside I love monthly security updates and loving that I can try android O( which I already did) and that Camera is really awesome. I think when Huawei can sell phones over $700 why not Google. (I would love if it was cheap but overall experience justifies that money for me) JD Man you need to raise your standards Sean Opinion: Even if you can, you probably shouldn't buy a Google Pixel anymore Winston David: Am I just a brainwashed Google fanboy (don't answer that question)? Yes. No. Probably. Maybe. Unlikely. Believable. Not sure. I'm a rebel. Andrew I know it's nitpicking but. I think you missed an 'us'. 'The Hardware' section, 2nd paragraph, last sentence. "...but I think it's safe to say most of want more screen where we can get it." Vivek Rameses Nobody is buying that piece of shit anyway. This is laughable. AndrewGM Good review, although if it's really the best smartphone you've ever used, then isn't it worth the premium price? Personally, I'm willing to pay another $100 or so for a phone I will use often, every day, for a couple of years and really enjoy using. The extra money in the end is nothing. I bought a used Pixel on eBay, so I saved about $50, but I really like it and am happy to pay a bit extra. The camera is great -- better than the iPhone, which I switched from. ddevito Remember when Android Police was an honest unbiased, tech savvy site? Alex Completely agree. Best phone I've ever owned, by far. Smooth as butter. Google just needs to work on their audio apis, along with other stuff. chumpatrump ive had a p6 huawei for 5 months and its feckin awesome. android like its meant to be - fast, stable, solid, easy to use, 36 hour charge TechGuy22 It's fine for what it is. I like mine. I still prefer my s7e over it. Maybe pixel 2 will better Vic Chai Was Nexus 6P your number one choice? Jon I've only ever connected to a Bluetooth speaker but never had a single Bluetooth issue ever.. Captain On! To whomever has a problem with the "don't buy this phone" line: if you're going to spend nearly $1000 on the Pixel, you're shortchanging yourself by not waiting less than half a year to spend the same amount on an upgraded device; you'd just be flat-out fiscally irresponsible. The 1st Gen Pixel will be a fine purchase after the Pixel 2 comes and the Pixel 1 goes on sale. At that point, it's fair game. You can save money and get a good experience, or you can pay more and get a great experience (relative). kaladdin I have had the Pixel XL since the launch. Yes, it is overpriced but the software experience alone makes it the best Android phone. P.S. I have never had any issues with the Bluetooth. Jago1908 Sorry, I just wasted some time here. I have my Moto X Play for one year now and it feels just as good as the time when I bought it. You're not selling it well. Give us a bit more. You're just leaving it personal. I prefer to use a cheaper phone that is as consistent as the Pixel. There are plenty. Come on! AhmedAlalfy Well why am I surprised ! A site as big as Android Police has to still suck it just not to piss off a company like Google. Well you could have deleted your (opinion article) better than making a fool of yourself like that. I know you said it's a good phone but these two articles in this order are just wrong. Be a man and stand for your words next time or just don't talk if you're afraid you're going to piss someone's off. I'm sound like hating I know but that's how I see it anyway take it or leave it. ‚Ä¶ I have a regular pixel.. it's awesome. Very consistent. Zero issues. No Bluetooth issues either, and the range is far superior to the Galaxy s7 we have to, so is the audio quality. Almost all his complaints I have never experienced, maybe it's a pixel xl thing? Idk.. and my battery life, is amazing compared to every other phone I have owned. I use a fair bit, and it lasts full day, usually still have 35-40% by 1am.. I stream music on and off all day, apps, surf, video.. usual stuff. No issues with slow finger print scanner either. It's bloody instant. I've owned Windows phones, and many "high end" android phones, and the pixel is the most reliable, most consistent phone I have had. I would buy again hands down. I'll take a product that just works right every time over bells and whistles. Yes make improvements, of course, but it really is the best overall phone I've ever used. Amit Raj I have been using the XL for about the same time...aside from the Warcraft struggle to get the phone, I agree with everything pointed out here. I do get these odd feelings to switch phones to the S8+ but I have no regrets with this phone. Having come from a flavoured android device (S6 Edge), I can vouch for the Pixel's fluidity, and consistency in performance. The only spite I have is the lack of android releases post 2018. Even Apple updates their devices that are nearly 5 years old. Why can't Google?! I can understand why any of the other ostensible android device manufacturers wouldn't rather can't update their devices to the latest android OS...hell they release devices like Rabbits reproducing. But for Google, come on you come out with 2 devices in a year and you can't give us atleast 4 years of android OS updates...leaving aside this rant, I really think you really get the real experience of having a smartphone...i.e. Android really puts the "smart" in smartphone and running it in its native state and on the Pixel it really outshines any other mobile OS to date...hands down....P.S. the Google keyboard could really get some AI updates for suggestions...other than this and the android OS upgrades, I'm a happy camper... Akshay Mehta Has anyone talked about the unlimited storage available in photos app ? I've shot photos and videos of more than 12GB since I got my pixel xl 6 months back. The camera and a consistent battery has just pushed me take so many photos! Even though I want to switch to s8, I can't. I'll just wait for pixel 2. Even though there have been numerous issues with the phone I still love it! Niero Gonzalez Buy it used. You can get a 32gb pixel for $400 on ebay, unlocked. Probably $300 when the new one is released. Unless you're an Android journalist there's no reason to buy an $800 phone unless you really want to show off your sushi photos Ryan Gray What's killing me is the screen burn in. Go watch a youtube video with a primarily solid color. Buttons and notifcation bar cant be unseen. Alisi Google any phone that has an AMOLED display about burn in. blindexecutioner I prefer the OnePlus 3T to the Pixel I sold. Never thought I would say that but I just don't care for the UI choices Google is making. Having the fingerprint scanner on the front along with capactivie buttons is really nice as well. Debanjan Chowdhury I also have a pixel xl and I love it. Debanjan Chowdhury Triggered Samsung fanboys, incoming. Debanjan Chowdhury I am using a pixel xl too but I never had Bluetooth problems‚Äã like you‚Äã. OK Google detection never broke for me. I didn't have to replace it or anything like that. And I am happy to be in India because the low stock issue is not here. blueman24 No way I'm buying a 57k phone. Especially when its available in the US for more than 10k cheaper while still being overpriced. Peter Silie Why do you Keep talking about the 128GB version as the version "you and I actually want"? I wouldn't even know what to do with that much space on my phone. I'm on a 32GB N5X with a s**tload of apps installed and a lot of downloaded Play Music titles and I still got 10GB of space. So no, the version I actually want would be the 32GB non-XL Pixel ;-) Alisi Do you play games? Have daydream? I've already had to do the "you don't have to go home, but you can't stay here" dance several times with my 32Gb. Leroy Filon The stock availbabilty is insane. I live in the Netherlands and it's not even out here yet. I drove to Germany back in november to get it. People ask me a lot about my phone when they see my mobile pictures on instagram and i'll tell em it's the Google phone with pride. But it's a shame i can't share this epicnes with fellow owners here in the Netherlands. Michael S√∏rensen "I rarely really get annoyed using it." Really? "The Bluetooth connectivity sucks. The back of the phone has very obvious wear rub. The glass window scratches easily. It's not waterproof. 'OK Google' hotword detection breaks for no apparent reason, necessitating a reboot (...takes a minut-plus...). The fingerprint scanner is slow..." Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà LMAO... like I said, he didn't even list all of the flaws. If that's the best phone he's ever used, he set the bar incredibly low. I can't even imagine what worse phones he was comparing it to. Maxr1998 Well, G6, S8? They do some things better, but he says the Pixel is better at other things, so in the end it wins. 3223 I dunno about you guys, but from what I read almost all reviewers cannot grasp exactly why it is better than other phones, other than 'it just is'. They can say it is smoother, and faster and all that, but hard data doesn't seem to back up that claim and they rubbish synthetic benchmarks over some abstract claim. I'm starting to see that having a G at the back of the phone, just like an apple logo, may have a placebo effect on its own, bringing people some good vibes, just like nexii phones in the past. Which makes for an interesting read or research as to how brands can affect perception. Jan Ibrahim No. ƒ∞t's nothing to do with placebo. There are very real significant improvements in touch latency which make a huge difference to your experience. ƒ∞t's not a commonly spoken about feature or spec, which is why a lot of reviews might not know why the phone feels better. But that's the main thing. 3223 That's the thing. Touch latency is a very common issue on android. And tbh I've been using an HTC 10 which reviewers mentioned when it launched that they tried to reduce touch latency by quite a lot. Additionally if i remember correctly the htc m8 (which i also used before) was regarded as having low touch latency as well. So why is it that when other manufacturers do it, it's kinda swept under the rug but when the goog does it, it becomes the coming of the messiah? You're right though, that there should be more definite tests on touch latency, coz I'll only believe it when I see the numbers.. Theuntje How can you love the camera? Doesn't your main camera sucks in recording video? Looks even like that my front camera is better at capturing video.. Michael S√∏rensen Can someone please link to a video showing off this legendary fluidity compared to others? Why is it so difficult to actually show when it's apparently oh so obvious? David Newman I'd be interested to see how they compare to the MI Mix, my guess is not very well ü§î roberto.elena Here is an idea for the next poll: Does David suffer dissociative identity disorder or is he just a troll? 1. Definitely DID 2. Definitely troll. 3. Even if you can, you shouldn't read everything he writes. 4. All he writes, including his personal Twitter, is gospel to me. Peter World Citizen This is the way I see it ... 1. David said don't buy the Pixel now 2. His Google tipster said he/she didn't like what he had said 3. David quickly back pedals with this article :) Kostas üí™üé© you obviously didn't read it till the end Daishi Or at all... BeholdersEye I don't understand why there is no stereo speakers! Damnit Google, you're‚Äã pushing the damn daydream view vr set then you don't put speakers on top and bottom (left/right in landscape mode), so BS! Google better offer trade-in for upgrade phone! And I certainly don't care for the extremely short software update deadend of only to 2018! We paid big bucks we deserve longer support!!!! Randy Gindy Everyone kind of dropped stereo speakers. Its really been replaced with a half assed version of stereo on some phones. Bottom firing and using the earpiece. username_not_valid I can only assume you havent used any other phone ever then. Nothing else makes logical sense. Jeff This is absolutely one of the worst phones I have ever used. It just had great marketing. For close to $1000 no Ir blaster to control remotes, people complaining about sound distortions, horrible and tedious screenshot capabilities and I don't think it charges fast at all. I'm going back to Samsung as soon as the note 8 is available. Cakefish October can't come soon enough! I need a Pixel 2 for the buttery performance, the amazing camera and the fast updates. Meanwhile, I'm stuck with the Galaxy S7, a great phone no doubt, but one that is showing signs of ageing (oleophobic coating wearing off, a battery that doesn't last as long as it used to and Android updates that come once in a blue moon). glebosotov Nice comment with funny mistype(is that how it's called?). BUTTERY more like battery Alisi Maybe he meant buttery as in smooth? glebosotov Maybe. Anyway, I think that most of us don't speak English as native language, so it's ok Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà I don't know if other OEMs have this problem, but I suspect pre-S8, Samsung batteries have been notorious for aging quickly. Even my Note 4 battery died way before it should have. The only good thing is I didn't have to take it to a shop to get it replaced. Patrick Smithopolis The camera and the smooth and consistent performance is why I don't have the urge to get a new phone. someone755 Long-term? Fuck man, it hasn't even been a year. The fact that you need to point out how well it's held over less than half its already limited lifetime can mean only one of two things; Either you're trying to compensate for the fact that the phone isn't as good as you'd hoped it would be (which may or may not be related to its inflated price), or you indeed are a head-over-heels Google fan. For all the shit I defend you against, David, I expected better of you. alcor86 Why the hell don't people put phone cases & screen protectors on their phone? I do that right out the box. Peter Ebenezer I agree, I love the pixel. But every single person I've talked to about it, I've told to not buy it. Purely for the Bluetooth issues. My galaxy S2 I had before this had rock solid Bluetooth but was incredibly old so needed to modernise and was fed up of manufacturers that delay updates by adding bloatware.. The pros outweigh the cons. But the con is a big one... Not to mention the fact they are on about spitting out the next one already... chris My z5 just hit a reboot disaster I picked up a pixel xl 128gb for $950 aus, best phone I've ever used and no dramas with Bluetooth after first week, I was holding out for pixel 2 but didn't make it.. I'm happy with my buy anyway , it's a brilliant phone , buy off eBay not a store and save $300 that's my advice.. What supply issues lol GregAndo Thanks, I have pretty much had every Google phone phone since the Nexus One, and whilst also loved the form factor the Bluetooth issues, Battery issues and OS bugs pushing me to weekly reboots were more than I could handle. So I took the S8+ after the note 7 went back... and skipped the Pixel XL. So glad I did, I had the same issues and they infuriated me in the end. When Google finally gets the build of Android out that focuses out these bugs...I might go back. Tool then i am happy with the S8+ so far, I hope it is more reliable. Keg Man Waiting to hear from the note 7 owners. Most of us thought that was the perfect phone despite the one manufacturing defect Kakairo This matches my experience with the Pixel XL, with the exception of wear and tear (probably due to the slim Spigen case I put on it). With the Bluetooth, though, I wonder if it's an issue with Mazda Connect (I know you drive a Miata, David, I have a Mazda 3). I haven't had any issues with Bluetooth headphones, and I've had two rental Nissans in the past month that worked without issue for over a week. Would I buy it again? Yes, absolutely. Would I buy one right now? No, for the simple fact that the S8 has now surpassed it and that Pixel 2 can't be too far away. sam1331 Uh, the Pixel XL is a big phone. The Pixel is even a big phone, bigger than the iPhone 7 in every single dimension. They sell an iPhone SE that is significantly smaller and people buy it. My point is that, claiming no one should consider the Pixel because the Pixel XL isn't too big isn't an opinion, it's "lunacy". Rod iPhone 7 is 4.7" Andre Meaux Yep! Still love my Pixel (XL)!! Looking for the Pixel XL 2! destinyhud cant wait for the pixel 2. its going to be even more awesome. it will be a day one buy for me Rod There's one thing I wonder about the Pixel: in those PhoneBuff "speed tests" the Pixel is always put to shame when it doesn't hold more than 4 apps in background. However, in this one, it was able to hold 13 apps, being 4 of them, games. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ugcpul8nYg) Who's telling the truth, afterall? mattcoz I had issues with Bluetooth cutting out with my headphones, but then I turned off "phone audio" and it has been perfect. I have noticed that the signal will get weak if I sit on it, but uhh, yeah that makes sense, so I don't do that. Jordan L just this morning, for the first time ever my car would not connect to my Pixel. damn it. Rod David's curse Mike I must have a Pixel XL that is the diamond in the rough. I have a travel job, meaning I'm in rental cars several times a month. I have never once had bluetooth connectivity issues, for real. Henry S. Maybe it's just me but I don't understand this need to go YUuuuuGe with screens anymore. We've reached the point of usability and carrying the damn thing. 5" was the sweet spot for me as a phone. If I want media, I'll watch on my tablet. My perfect phone size was the old Droid MAXX(also a 5" phone). Most of the points make sense. I get the same battery life as you on my OG Pixel except Bluetooth. Only exception is switching between devices on my wife's small Bose speaker and we always have problems no matter the phone so it's not just the Pixel. Xenios Kofteros Got a full refund for my 1.5 year old Nexus 6P for the known battery issues. I'd very much like to buy a Pixel XL, but the price for new and used are ridiculous. Hopefully Google will break tradition and reveal Pixel 2 at Google I/O. Or else I'm going the OnePlus 5 way and break 4 years of Google phone use tradition. ClikFire _ I haven't had any of the issues you mentioned except the issue with hairline scratches because I hate using cases. SoI covered the glass windows with a Matte Black Dbrand Skin and found a Tempered Glass screen bezel which actually transformed the Dark Grey Bezels to true black bezels and covered up the scratches in the process. Also coming from an S7 edge I actually really like the Design of the Pixel personally especially the back with the Glass window, makes it stand out from the rest. If the Pixel 2 looks like this and adds front facing speakers and water resistance I'm game. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/842173829c88496d628fe9ecdf0b77f65995d3ca89cb1a2d93e7896ad2c760f1.png Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà If Google continues the current trend in its phones, it's more likely to look like this. ;) https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/6945f5a7bc54ba27628971ea239b5d6ee5d8f0bb2b8aa844f6e67a2d6ec05c12.png Rod I was about to burst in laughter, then I thought this may actually happen. Ozl Never had any problems with my 128GB Pixel, still works great! krkn I got the Pixel 128GB when it came out because I had a Note7, which I loved, and the XL was unavailable. Despite the smaller size, I have still really enjoyed the phone. Like you said, it remains snappy and the better life good, and sometimes I actually appreciate something that fits in my pocket so nicely. Photos are terrific. My main gripe is the speaker location, which is blocked easily in landscape mode, but that's a small nit since if I really need better sound, I'll be plugged in or using a Bluetooth speaker. Randall Collins I have the XL and I haven't had quite as many issues with mine but it really is a great phone despite all that. No lag, smooth, and the first to get updates with no crazy UI to destroy the experience. And I updated from an iPhone 6+ which had all those same attributes. No phone will ever be perfect but for now, the XL works for me. likurges if the phone was so great as it's bezzels it would be the best phone ever Randy Gindy At least I have something to hold onto when I watch a video. likurges yes because a phone is a heavy thing and doesn't have corners. thank god for the bezels of the pixel. also think for example if you hear some shocking news, you can hold to those bezels and they might as well save your life JR I'd have no problem recommending either of the Pixel devices to potential buyers, today. Many buyers enter the market for a new phone, because they need one. If you're one of those people who only updates their device when the current one is on its last leg, then the Pixel is an outstanding option (six months isn't something many would care to wait). The casual buyer primarily needs a good experience, preferably over a long term, and as discussed in this article, the Pixel delivers this quite well, 'right now' (to be fair, that's *if* you can find one). If the price drops once the Pixel 2 launches, even better. If you're talking to enthusiasts, then we can push this a few ways, but we always have the option to sell the Pixel, should we desire the new shiny thing. The Nexus 6P (still a great phone) fetches nice prices in the aftermarket, and the Pixel is generally understood to be an even better phone. I'm sure the Pixel will command a fine (but lower than new) aftermarket price, and there will always be a set of buyers who can't afford the absolute latest, but will be willing to scoop one up at a more realistic discount. So unless the device is missing game-breaking, hard features you rely on (waterproofing, because you're a part-time lifeguard), then I think it would be acceptable to recommend it. Fastguy77 This article makes no sense. I purchased a pixel brand new for half price, best decision ever. Phone is amazing. So by all means, find someone selling it below MSRP and grab it. Waiting half a year because 'you'll regret' not having the newest is typical tech buyer stupidity. So, just wait and never buy a product, cause around the corner is the next better version... xyz "Is the XL worth $770 to pick up today?" Wasn't worth it even at release!

Simply changing your thoughts will help Friday, May 05, 2017 Helen O‚ÄôCallaghan A successful and wealthy Google engineer had little joy in his life so he set out to formulate an equation for happiness, writes Helen O‚ÄôCallaghan. Faced with the question of how to be happy, what else would a Google engineer do than devise an equation? Which is exactly what tech entrepreneur Mo Gawdat did, when ‚Äî despite enjoying lots of success, wealth and recognition ‚Äî he couldn‚Äôt find any joy in his life.¬† ‚ÄúEven my greatest blessing, my family, didn‚Äôt give me the joy they might have because I couldn‚Äôt receive it. In my constant quest for more, I‚Äôd become pushy and aggressive ‚Äî even at home.¬† "I spent little time appreciating the remarkable woman I‚Äôd married, little time with my wonderful son and daughter, and never paused to enjoy each day as it unfolded,‚Äù he writes in his book, Solve for Happy, Engineer Your Path to Joy. Dubai- and California-based Gawdat decided to apply his ‚Äúgeek‚Äôs approach to self-study‚Äù, along with his engineer‚Äôs analytical mind to digging his way out of his misery.¬† Google engineer Mo Gawdat used his mathematical knowledge to formulate an equation that would bring him happiness. It took 10 years of research ‚Äî he read every title he could find on happiness, attended every lecture, watched every documentary and diligently analysed all he learned ‚Äî until he found a code he could apply to life that predictably delivered happiness every time. It boiled down to something apparently simple: happiness happens when life seems to be going your way.¬† Gawdat‚Äôs ‚ÄòHappiness Equation‚Äô is this: if you perceive the events of your life as equal to or greater than your expectations of how life should behave, you‚Äôre happy. But the key point is: it‚Äôs not the event that makes us unhappy ‚Äî it‚Äôs the way we think about it that does. As an example, he cites one of the happiest moments of his life ‚Äî when his ‚Äúbeautiful, classic Saab got totalled in a crash‚Äù.¬† How could this be a happy moment? Because in the head-on collision with a truck, ‚Äúairbags, safety-belts and all other safety features deployed exactly as planned‚Äù ‚Äî and his wife, Nibal (they have since separated but remain close), who was driving the car, walked out without a scratch. ‚ÄúI lost my car. So what? My beloved wife was spared.‚Äù¬† But, he says, if Nibal had parked the car somewhere and then it was smashed he‚Äôd have been devastated.¬† ‚ÄúThe results would have been the same ‚Äî wrecked car and safe Nibal ‚Äî but my experience of it would have been different. The event itself was irrelevant. It was the way I looked at it that mattered.‚Äù So he asks what he calls the $50 million question ‚Äî ‚Äòcould we become happy by simply changing our thoughts?‚Äô ‚Äî and he answers it: Of course. But 13 years after formulating ‚Äî and living contentedly by his Happiness Equation ‚Äî Egyptian-born Gawdat‚Äôs algorithm got the ultimate test.¬† His son, Ali, 21, was having a routine appendectomy when a needle punctured his femoral artery ‚Äî a major vessel carrying blood from the heart ‚Äì and within a few hours his beloved son was gone. Despite profound grief, Gawdat writes in his book (begun 17 days after Ali‚Äôs death) that his happiness model worked for the family.¬† ‚ÄúEven during the moments of most intense grief, we were never angry or resentful of life. We didn‚Äôt feel cheated or depressed. We went through the most difficult event imaginable ‚Äî in peace.‚Äù In brief, Gawdat‚Äôs happiness model asks us to remember three numbers ‚Äî no surprise from a self-professed maths lover ‚Äî six-seven-five.¬† To be happy, he says we need to dispel six Grand Illusions that keep us confused, fix seven Blind Spots that distort our judgment of the reality of life and hang onto five Ultimate Truths. His six Grand Illusions (hinder our ability to make sense of the world) Thought ‚Äî in fact, you are not the voice in your head Self ‚Äî in fact, you are not the star of the movie: most of what happens around you isn‚Äôt about you at all Knowledge ‚Äî reset your definitions of ‚Äògood‚Äô and ‚Äòbad‚Äô; every moment of your life is neither all good nor all bad Time ‚Äî life is now and now is amazing Control ‚Äî all we can control is our actions and our attitude Fear ‚Äî it‚Äôs our actions and not our fears that keep us safe. His seven Blind Spots (affecting the way our brain processes information) Filters ‚Äî when we obsess about something that makes us unhappy, we filter out any positive signals that could change our frame of mind Assumptions ‚Äî we assume information that seems to be missing, but assumptions are nothing more than brain-generated stories. They‚Äôre not the truth Predictions ‚Äî we predict to fill in future gaps but predictions are nothing more than brain-generated future possibilities Memories ‚Äî these are just descriptions of what we think happened Labels ‚Äî when we label, we collapse the diverse possibilities of how events actually are into, at best, an approximation Emotions ‚Äî our perceptions of truth are often distracted by our irrational emotions Exaggeration ‚Äî when a negative event is exaggerated, we worry about it even if, statistically, it‚Äôs unlikely to happen to us. His five Ultimate Truths Now ‚Äî all of life is here and now. ‚ÄúSo why do most of us live there and then instead?‚Äù asks Gawdat. Why do we let our absence from the present ‚Äî ruminating on the past and bracing ourselves for the future ‚Äî cause us so much suffering? Change is real ‚Äî the one thing we can accurately predict is that the world tomorrow will be different from the world today Love is all you need ‚Äî true love is real. All other emotions are temporary. Death is real ‚Äî learn to let go, eg, attachment to physical possessions, and enjoy every experience. But let nothing own you and you find life rich with variety and free of fear Design ‚Äî Gawdat believes it‚Äôs freeing when one surrenders to a design that‚Äôs beyond one‚Äôs ability to grasp. Gawdat‚Äôs book is full of stories ‚Äî quite a few from Arabic folk culture ‚Äî and studies that bear out his happiness model.¬† He cites research by Matt Killingsworth of www.Trackyourhappiness.org¬†of more than 15,000 participants who reported ‚Äî sometimes minute by minute ‚Äî how they felt and what they were doing at the time.¬† It found, no matter what they were doing at any given time, they were noticeably happier when they were fully present in the moment. Gawdat‚Äôs expos√© of our brain‚Äôs bias towards pessimism ‚Äî it tends to criticise, judge and complain more often than not ‚Äî is an eye-opener.¬† Obsessed with keeping us alive, the brain tends to ignore the obvious which, he says, is that negatives we encounter are the exceptions interrupting a norm of constantly-flowing positives. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt believe me?‚Äù he asks.¬† ‚ÄúThen, answer this: what‚Äôs the norm, health or illness? Good weather or typhoons? How often do you have to live through an earthquake compared to walking on solid ground?‚Äù¬† He gives his golden rule for happiness ‚Äî choose to believe in the side that makes you happy: ‚ÄúThat side is more likely closer to the truth. Choosing the side that makes you suffer, with no evidence to prove your view, is not a very smart thing to do. When nothing is certain ‚Äî and nothing ever is ‚Äî choose to be happy.‚Äù Dr Mark Rowe, GP and author of A Prescription for Happiness, says about 50% of our potential for happiness is inherited ‚Äî ‚Äúwe all have a genetic happiness set point‚Äù ‚Äî only about 10% comes from our life circumstances (once you‚Äôre not living in war-torn Syria, have a roof over your head and enough to eat), while 40% of happiness potential is down to the choices we make for contentment/fulfilment/peace. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre incredibly resilient and can overcome all sorts of adversity,‚Äù he says, citing ‚Äòpost-traumatic growth‚Äô ‚Äî being able to grow from adversity. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a choice, no matter what‚Äôs going on in your life, to become more of a leader in your own wellbeing.‚Äù In his book, he outlines his 10 commitments to a healthier, happier life. They‚Äôre not, he says, ‚Äúa rigid prescription but a menu of possibilities ‚Äî science suggests that doing these things works for many‚Äù. They include gratitude (natural antidote to negativity), kindness and compassion (live to give) and goals that allow you to grow. Everybody has adversity, points out Rowe: ‚ÄúWe all have fires in our lives, in our careers, relationships. Everything that brings life must endure burning. But it‚Äôs how you make your story that matters, how you join the dots in your own life. Every experience can be an opportunity to learn and grow.‚Äù In keeping with one of Gawdat‚Äôs Ultimate Truths, clinical psychologist Dr Eddie Murphy says understanding that change is constant sets us up for contentment.¬† ‚ÄúHow we cope with change impacts our happiness. We can either change the situation ‚Äî or change how we think about it. People who struggle with change create stress and distress,‚Äù says Murphy. For Gawdat, the most challenging adversity was losing Ali. Is there anything worse, he wonders? And he decides, yes, there is ‚Äì if his son died from cancer after months of harsh treatment or if he died of a drug overdose. ‚ÄúI choose to feel grateful for the 21 wonderful years he blessed us with his presence. Instead of feeling resentful he died, I feel grateful he lived.‚Äù * Solve for Happy by Mo Gawdat is published by Bluebird and costs ‚Ç¨17.75. Control the inner voice Mo Gawdat says modern culture drastically overvalues logic and thought.¬† ‚ÄúBut you are not your thoughts. You are not the voice in your head ‚Äî that endless stream of chatter that argues, fights, debates, criticises, compares and rarely stops to take a breath.‚Äù He suggests the following techniques to control the voice in your head: * Observe the dialogue. Don‚Äôt resist the thoughts that pop up. Keep watching them as they roll through. Observe a thought ‚Äî then let it go. Remind yourself this thought isn‚Äôt you. Thoughts come and go. They have no power over you unless you give them power. * Observe the drama. No one‚Äôs able to let go of every thought. Occasionally, an idea will stick. When you notice this happen, acknowledge how you feel, the emotion triggered by the thought. Don‚Äôt resist it ‚Äî let it be. Ask why you became angry or agitated. What thought led you here? Why did you get this angry? What association is your brain making? Once you see the reason for your feelings, they become easier to navigate. * Get your brain to bring you a better thought. An untamed brain needs a thought to cling to. But your brain can be primed ‚Äî to focus on anything you want ‚Äî so tell your brain to think about something happy. Any happy thought will short-circuit your brain‚Äôs negative chatter. * Train your brain to find what‚Äôs good about any situation. What do I like about it? What‚Äôs the full half of the glass?

Thank you for supporting the partners who make SitePoint possible. More from this author Three Ways of Decreasing SVG File Size with SVGO Lightning Fast Websites with Prefetching I‚Äôve always thought deciding how and when to load CSS files is something best left to browsers. They handle this sort of thing by design. Why should developers do anything more than slap a link element with rel="stylesheet" and href="style.css" inside the <head> section of the document and forget about it? Apparently, this may not be enough today, at least if you care about website speed and fast-rendering webpages. Given how both these factors impact on user experience and the success of your website, it‚Äôs likely you‚Äôve been looking into ways you can gain some control over the default way in which browsers deal with downloading stylesheets. In this article, I‚Äôm going to touch on what could be wrong with the way browsers load CSS files and discuss possible ways of approaching the problem, which you can try out in your own website. The Problem: CSS Is Render Blocking If you‚Äôve ever used Google Page Speed Insights to test website performance, you might have come across a message like this: Here Google Page Insights is stating the problem and offering a strategy to counteract it. Let‚Äôs try to understand the problem a bit better first. Browsers use the DOM (Document Object Model) and the CSSOM (CSS Object Model) to display web pages. The DOM is a model of the HTML which the browser needs in order to be able to render the web page‚Äôs structure and content. The CSSOM is a map of the CSS, which the browser uses to style the web page. CSS being on the critical rendering path means that the browser stops rendering the web page until all the HTML and style information is downloaded and processed. This explains why both HTML and CSS files are considered to be render blocking. External stylesheets especially involve multiple roundtrips between browser and server. This may cause a delay between the time the HTML has been downloaded and the time the page renders on the screen. The problem consists in this delay, during which users could be staring at a blank screen for a number of milliseconds. Not the best experience when first landing on a website. The Concept of Critical CSS Although HTML is essential to page rendering, otherwise there would be nothing to render, can we say the same about CSS? Of course, an unstyled web page is not user friendly, and from this point of view it makes sense for the browser to wait until the CSS is downloaded and parsed before rendering the page. On the other hand, you could argue that not all style information is critical to building a usable page. What users are immediately interested in is the above the fold portion of the page, that is, that portion which users can consume without needing to scroll. This thought is behind the dominant approach available today to solve this problem, including the suggestion contained in the message from Google Page Insights reported above. The bit of interest there reads: Try to defer or asynchronously load blocking resources, or inline the critical portions of those resources directly in the HTML. But how do you defer or asynchronously load stylesheets on your website? Not as straightforward as it might sound. You can‚Äôt just toss an async attribute on the link element as if it were a <script&gt tag. Below are a few ways in which developers have tackled the problem. Take Advantage of Media Types and Media Queries to Minimize Render Blocking Ilya Grigorik illustrates a simple way of minimizing page rendering block which involves two stages: Split the content of your external CSS into different files according to media type and media queries, thereby avoiding big CSS documents that take longer to download Reference each file with the appropriate media type and media query inside the link element. Doing so prevents some stylesheet files from being render blocking if the conditions set out by the media type or media query are not met. As an example, references to your external CSS files in the <head> section of your document might look something like this: <link href="style.css" rel="stylesheet">
<link href="print.css" rel="stylesheet" media="print">
<link href="other.css" rel="stylesheet" media="(min-width: 40em)"> The first link in the snippet above doesn‚Äôt use any media type or media query. The browser considers it as matching all cases, therefore it always delays page rendering while fetching and processing the resource. The second link has a media="print" attribute, which is a way of telling the browser: ‚ÄúHowdy browser, make sure you apply this stylesheet only if the page is being printed‚Äù. In the context of the page simply being viewed on the screen, the browser knows that stylesheet is not needed, therefore it won‚Äôt block page rendering to download it. Finally, the third link contains media="(min-width: 40em)", which means that the stylesheet being referenced in the link is render-blocking only if the conditions stated by the media query match, i.e., where the viewport‚Äôs width is at least 40em. In all other cases the resource is not render blocking. Also, take note that the browser will always download all stylesheets, but will give lower priority to non-blocking ones. To sum up, this approach doesn‚Äôt completely eliminate the problem, but can considerably minimize the time browsers block page rendering. Using the preload Directive on the Link Element A cutting-edge feature you could leverage to counteract the block of the web page by browsers as they fetch external stylesheets, is the standard-based preload directive. preload is how we, as developers, can tell browsers to fetch specific resources because we know the page is going to need those resources quite soon. Scott Jehl, designer and developer working for The Filament Group, can be credited to be the first one who tinkered with this idea. Here‚Äôs what you need to do. Add preload to the link referencing the stylesheet, add a tiny bit of JavaScript magic using the link‚Äôs onload event, and the result is like having an asynchronous loading of the stylesheet directly in your markup: <link rel="preload" as="style" href="style.css" onload="this.rel='stylesheet'"> The snippet above gets the browser to fetch style.css in a non-blocking way. After the resource has finished loading, i.e., the link‚Äôs onload event has fired, the script replaces the preload value of the rel attribute with stylesheet and the styles are applied to the page. At this time browser support for preload is confined to Chrome and Opera. But fear not, a polyfill provided by the Filament Group is at hand. More on this in the next section. The Filament Group‚Äôs Solution: From Inlining CSS to HTTP/2 Server Push Solving the problem of delayed page rendering due to fetching of critical resources has long been the highest priority for the Filament Group, an award-winning design and development agency based in Boston: Our highest priority in the delivery process is to serve HTML that‚Äôs ready to begin rendering immediately upon arrival in the browser. The latest update on optimizing web page delivery outlines their progress from inlining critical CSS to super efficient HTTP/2 Server Push. The overall strategy looks like this: Any assets that are critical to rendering the first screenful of our page should be included in the HTML response from the server. Any assets that are not critical to that first rendering should be delivered in a non-blocking, asynchronous manner. Before HTTP/2 Server Push, implementing #1 consisted in selecting the critical CSS rules, i.e., those needed for default styles and for a seamless rendering of the above the fold portion of the webpage, and cramming them in a <style> element inside the page‚Äôs <head> section. Filament Group devs devised Critical, a cool JavaScript plugin, to automate the task of extracting critical CSS. With recent adoption of HTTP/2 Server Push, Filament Group has moved beyond inlining critical CSS. What is Server Push? What is it good for? Server push allows you to send site assets to the user before they‚Äôve even asked for them. ‚Ä¶ Server push lets the server preemptively ‚Äúpush‚Äù website assets to the client without the user having explicitly asked for them. When used with care, we can send what we know the user is going to need for the page they‚Äôre requesting. Jeremy Wagner In other words, when the browser requests a particular page, let‚Äôs say index.html, all the assets that page depends upon will be included in the response, e.g., style.css, main.js, etc., with a huge optimization boost on page rendering speed. Putting into practice #2, asynchronous loading of non critical CSS, is done using a combination of the preload directive technique discussed in the previous section and LoadCSS, a Filament Group‚Äôs JavaScript library that includes a polyfill for those browsers that don‚Äôt support preload. Using LoadCSS involves adding this snippet to your document‚Äôs <head> section: <link rel="preload" href="mystylesheet.css" as="style" onload="this.rel='stylesheet'">
<!-- for browsers without JavaScript enabled -->
<noscript><link rel="stylesheet" href="mystylesheet.css">
</noscript> Notice the <noscript> block that references the stylesheet file as usual to cater for those situations when JavaScript goes wrong or has been disabled. Below the <noscript> tag, include LoadCSS and the LoadCSS rel=preload polyfill script inside a <script> tag: <script>
/*! loadCSS. [c]2017 Filament Group, Inc. MIT License */
(function(){ ... }());
/*! loadCSS rel=preload polyfill. [c]2017 Filament Group, Inc. MIT License */
(function(){ ... }());
</script> You can find detailed instructions on using LoadCSS in the project‚Äôs GitHub repo and see it in action in this live demo. I lean towards this approach: it‚Äôs got a progressive enhancement outlook, it‚Äôs clean and developer friendly. Placing the Link to the Stylesheet Files in the Document Body According to Jake Archibald, one drawback of the previous approach is that it relies on a major assumption about what you or I can consider as being critical CSS. It should be obvious that all styles applied to the above the fold portion of the page are critical. However, what exactly constitutes above the fold is all but obvious because changes with viewport dimensions affect the amount of content users can access without scrolling. Therefore, one-size-fits-all is not always a reliable guess. Jake Archibald proposes a different solution, which looks like this: <head>
</head>
<body>
<!-- HTTP/2 push this resource, or inline it -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/site-header.css">
<header>‚Ä¶</header>

<link rel="stylesheet" href="/article.css">
<main>‚Ä¶</main>

<link rel="stylesheet" href="/comment.css">
<section class="comments">‚Ä¶</section>

<link rel="stylesheet" href="/about-me.css">
<section class="about-me">‚Ä¶</section>

<link rel="stylesheet" href="/site-footer.css">
<footer>‚Ä¶</footer>
</body> As you can see, references to external stylesheets are not placed in the <head> section but inside the document‚Äôs <body>. Further, the only styles that are rendered immediately with the page, either inlined or using HTTP/2 Server Push, are those that apply to the upper portion of the page. All other external stylesheets are placed just before the chunk of HTML content to which they apply: article.css before <main>, site-footer.css before <footer>, etc. Here‚Äôs what this technique aims to achieve: The plan is for each <link rel=‚Äùstylesheet‚Äù/> to block rendering of subsequent content while the stylesheet loads, but allow the rendering of content before it. The stylesheets load in parallel, but they apply in series. ‚Ä¶ This gives you a sequential render of the page. You don‚Äôt need decide what‚Äôs ‚Äúabove the fold‚Äù, just include a page component‚Äôs CSS just before the first instance of the component. All browsers seem to allow the placement of <link> tags in the document‚Äôs <body>, although not all of them behave exactly in the same way. That said, for the most part this technique achieves its goal. You can find out all the details on Jake Archibald‚Äôs post and check out the result in this live demo. Conclusion The problem with the way in which browsers download stylesheets is that page rendering is blocked until all files have been fetched. This means user experience when first landing on a web page might suffer, especially for those on flaky internet connections. Here I‚Äôve presented a few approaches that aim to solve this problem. I‚Äôm not sure if small websites with relatively little and well-structured CSS would be much worse off if they just left the browser to its own devices when downloading stylesheets. What do you think, does lazy loading stylesheets, or their sequential application (Jake Archibald‚Äôs proposal), work as a way of improving page rendering speed on your website?

On Wednesday, hackers targeted Gmail users by sending out an invite to open a Google Doc, which asked users to give permission to manage the users‚Äô email account before being able to open the link. From there, the hackers were able to access personal information and send a similar email to each users‚Äô contact list. According to a report by NBC, Google has been able to stop the attack and notify the approximately 1 million users who were impacted. The company also asked users to begin reporting suspicious emails using the ‚Äúreport phishing‚Äù feature. In April, the National Association of Realtors sent a warning to its members about phishing attacks after a hacker sent emails with a ‚ÄúNAR: Urgent Update‚Äù subject line. The intent of the attack wasn‚Äôt determined, but NAR reminded real estate professionals¬†to be extra vigilant about phishing scams because client information is at stake as well. NAR Association Counsel Jessica Edgerton¬†wrote a blog post about how Realtors can protect buyers from phishing scams, but there‚Äôs plenty of helpful tips on how agents can protect themselves, too: Trust your gut. If an email seems suspicious, delete it. Regularly clean out your email inbox. Edgerton says a ‚Äúlongstanding backlog‚Äù of emails could give scammers access to sensitive information. If you have to send sensitive information via email, such as wire transfer number, make sure your email is encrypted. Change your usernames and passwords on a regular basis, and make sure your passwords aren‚Äôt ‚Äúeasy to guess.‚Äù Use the most up-to-date firewall and anti-virus technologies to protect your information. If you‚Äôve been compromised, immediately change your username and password and notify anyone else who‚Äôs information could have been exposed.

CNBC reviews the BlackBerry KeyOne, an Android smartphone built by TCL with BlackBerry software. Fans looking for a full keyboard may like what they see.More If you're among the dedicated few still attached to your BlackBerry (Toronto Stock Exchange: BB-CA), then listen up: We've been testing the BlackBerry KeyOne Android smartphone for the last few days, and we think you're going to like it. One thing you should know: BlackBerry Limited doesn't build its own smartphones anymore. Instead, it licenses its name and hardware patents (including the beloved keyboard) to TCL Communications and provides the software ‚Äî Android with a BlackBerry skin ‚Äî while TCL Communications (: 2618-HK) manufactures and handles sales and marketing of BlackBerry Mobile devices. This is the first device launched by TCL Communications since it agreed to license the BlackBerry brand in December. The deal gave TCL a more primary role in working with the brand and BlackBerry hardware. The KeyOne was introduced earlier this year and launched recently in Canada and will release in the U.S. next month for $549, completely unlocked, and on Sprint this summer. Rock solid design and all the basics The BlackBerry KeyOne feels like it was built by BlackBerry, which means TCL did a good job keeping things familiar. The highlight of the device is its hardware backlit keyboard, which some people apparently still want in a smartphone. More on that later. The KeyOne also offers a 4.5-inch touchscreen display and a rock-solid aluminum body that gives it a premium feel and look. I also like the dedicated convenience key, pictured above, which can be programmed to open almost any application. I set it to open my Google Now page, so I can view the weather, my package delivery statuses and other information provided by Google to Android users. Oddly, this button is placed below the volume keys, and I frequently mistook it for the power button. That aside, there are other niceties, like a new USB-C port that most manufacturers have moved to. It's reversible, so it's easier to plug in if you can't see the port, and supports faster charging to juice up the phone quickly. Speaking of the battery, I could get through a full work day easily and didn't have to charge until I hit the bed at night. I wasn't really spending my time watching movies or playing games though, and instead focused on emails, checking Twitter and surfing the web. A few tricks exclusive to BlackBerry The KeyOne has a few features you won't find on smartphones from competitors. The spacebar doubles as a fingerprint reader, for example, and you can use the keyboard as a touchpad to scroll through websites. BlackBerry Hub provides an all-in-one home for your text messages, social alerts, emails, calendar events and more, which will be particularly useful to the busy executive or parent. A fast and good camera The camera snapped great pictures during my tests, which was a bit surprising since I don't typically expect much from BlackBerry cameras. It's the same module in the Google Pixel, but I still think that device takes clearer and more accurate pictures, likely thanks to Google's software tuning. The camera is quick though, which is an improvement over the BlackBerry Priv, the last Android smartphone BlackBerry launched with a full keyboard. Security BlackBerry has always been known for its emphasis on secure communication ‚Äî there's a reason it's still used by a lot of government customers ‚Äî and the company's new plan is to sell you on the security of its software while turning the actual hardware over to TCL. On the new phone, an app called DTEK monitors your smartphone security at all times and gives you a score on how secured it thinks your phone is. There are a lot of factors, like whether you let your phone automatically install apps from the app store, that can affect this rating. In general, it's easy to make sure you're in the green zone of security approval. It won't really matter to most consumers, though. Google already protects apps in the Android Play Store to help prevent malware from spreading before you even download them. Competitors are locking down their devices more than ever before, too. Samsung provides similar enterprise-grade security options in its Knox software, some Android phones get monthly security updates and more. Then there are the downsides The display is bright, though not as high quality as what you'd find on similarly priced smartphones (the colors don't pop as much, and it isn't as sharp). The processor is also mid-range for what you're paying. The phone seems snappy enough, but it doesn't support next-generation Gigabit LTE networks that will begin rolling out this year and are going to enable faster speeds for when you need to download a big file from the office or stream a video. Read More The BlackBerry KeyOne isn't water resistant like the latest phones from Apple and Samsung, either. That means you're more prone to damage if you accidentally spill water on it or get caught in a downpour waiting for a cab. Also, if you're like me, you're probably used to typing on a touchscreen phone by this point. It's actually hard to move back to typing on a QWERTY keyboard. And unlike the BlackBerry Priv, which offered a software keyboard option, you have to stick to the hardware here. There just isn't enough screen space to type on a software keyboard (and the form factor doesn't make sense for one.) Final thoughts: Fine for keyboard die-hards The good news is there isn't anything inherently wrong with the phone. Keys weren't popping off, for example, and I was able to place phone calls, download apps and go about my business just fine. It's just that I always found myself turning to another device, like the new Galaxy S8, instead of the BlackBerry KeyOne. Once upon a time, it would have been unfair to compare a BlackBerry to an Android phone or the iPhone, but now that BlackBerry has switched to Android, and as Samsung and Apple have continued to court the enterprise, the comparison is fair enough. If you're among the dying breed of folks who long for the days of returning to poke-typing on a full smartphone keyboard, then by all means check out the KeyOne. If you don't look fondly upon that, as I no longer do, then consider a Galaxy S8 or iPhone 7.

Bikes, long an underdog on streets, will rule the roads eventually. That's the conclusion of Horace Dediu, a prominent analyst of disruptive technologies, who has spent the past three and a half years researching the future of transportation. By Matt McFarland WASHINGTON (CNNMoney) -- Bikes, long an underdog on streets, will rule the roads eventually. That's the conclusion of Horace Dediu, a prominent analyst of disruptive technologies, who has spent the past three and a half years researching the future of transportation. Transportation is arguably the hottest frontier in the tech world. Innovators in Silicon Valley and beyond are spending billions to build flying cars and self-driving trucks. Tesla CEO Elon Musk talks of digging costly 30-level tunnel networks for cars. Google cofounder Sergey Brin reportedly has a giant airship. But as Dediu sees it, a familiar, unglamorous technology will own the future: the bicycle. And the big loser will be cars. "Bikes have a tremendous disruptive advantage over cars. Bikes will eat cars," Dediu told CNNTech, referencing investor Marc Andreessen's seminal 2011 argument that software-driven businesses are dominating the world. Dediu points to the explosive growth of Chinese bikeshare systems as well as the versatility, low cost and efficiencies of shared bicycles. Bikeshare bikes of the future, according to Dediu, will be outfitted with cameras and sensors, collecting valuable data for cities. When a cyclist rides over a pothole, it can be automatically reported to a city. Cameras on the bicycle will provide real-time data, such as pedestrian traffic and pollution. Google Street View will look like an antique compared to near real-time imagery collected from bikeshare cameras. The bikes will need to be carefully constructed so that the cameras and sensors aren't easily broken during use. Software and electrification are slowly transforming the auto industry. There's talk of self-driving cars flooding streets in five or 10 years. It will likely take even longer for electric vehicles to go mainstream. Dediu argues that electric, connected bikes will arrive en masse before autonomous, electric cars. Riders will barely have to pedal as they whiz down streets once congested with cars. Bikes' flexible nature will aid their popularity. You can park a bicycle in your home or your office. A bike can be carried on a bus, car or train. A car doesn't offer this versatility. A similar case of disruption played out with cameras, as the always-in-your-pocket nature of smartphones helped them leave traditional cameras in the dust. Bikes have another edge on cars -- speed. New York's shared bicycles have already been shown to travel at a faster average speed than city taxis during peak hours. They're also more affordable per mile. While the speed edge seen in New York today doesn't hold up in every city, it will likely change as electric bicycles emerge. Electric bikes -- whose motors generally top out at 20 mph -- will attract customers because they don't have to worry about breaking a sweat, struggling to climb a hill or keeping up with traffic. "When you get on an electric bike, what we witnessed is a lot of those anxieties are calmed," said Elliott McFadden, executive director of the Austin B-Cycle, the city's bikeshare program. It recently surveyed citizens' interest in electric bikes. "Normally if we introduce a group to bikeshare, maybe a third or half of people are interested. But almost everybody was really intensely interested in using this service," he said. McFadden is planning a pilot program with electric bicycles in Austin. Sales are already skyrocketing in Europe. Bikeshare systems have grown rapidly in the United States, but they aren't close to displacing cars. There needs to be a dramatic increase in bike usage for the dominance of cars to be challenged. LimeBike, a U.S. bikeshare startup, believes a key drawback today is a lack of available shared bikes. "You look at any major or mid-sized city, they're all significantly under capacity in terms of the bikes necessary to truly change transportation habits in the public," said LimeBike vice president of strategic development Andrew Savage. LimeBike plans to launch its first bikesharing network early this summer. It has not disclosed where. It's counting on a density of bikes and a dock-less system to help it stand out. Bikeshare networks generally require riders to return bikes to stations, which can be inconvenient. LimeBike won't have stations, so bikes can be parked anywhere. This will make transportation more fluid for riders. Bikes will be found and unlocked via a smartphone. By improving accessibility and convenience, bikesharing could go into hypergrowth mode. The potential is already playing out in China, where new bikeshare networks dwarf the U.S. networks in size. America's largest programs, in New York and San Francisco, are expanding to 12,000 and 7,000 bikes, respectively. Beijing has more than 650,000 shared bicycles. They've all appeared in the last nine months. The two heavweights of Chinese bikesharing are ofo and Mobike, which operates in more than 50 cities. Unlike most U.S. bikeshare programs, the bikes can be parked anywhere, increasing convenience for riders. Mobike users take 20 million rides a day on the startup's 3.6 million bikes, according to the company. In the last few weeks, it's begun testing pollution sensors on some of its bicycles. Dediu projects that there will be more than 100 million shared bicycles on global roads by 2025. According to MetroBike, there were 2.3 million shared bicycles at the end of 2016. But there are challenges to the wide adoption of shared bicycling. Two of the biggest are infrastructure and weather. Many potential cyclists are fearful of riding amid cars and trucks. Without protected bike lanes that shield bikes from vehicles, many people will never dare to ride a bike on a crowded street. As Dediu sees it, first the disruptive technology arrives, then the suitable environment follows. Early roads weren't smooth enough for the first cars. Early cellular networks couldn't handle smartphone data. But with time, the world adapted to fit the promising technology. Bike lanes are already growing worldwide. And then there's weather. Riding in the rain or snow is unpleasant. Dediu notes that the first cars and planes were open air vehicles. But they morphed into cocoons. Dediu expects bikes will follow a similar evolution. He also expects grassroots excitement to propel the bicycle industry forward. The passion for bicycles exceeds other cutting-edge transportation projects. Surveys have shown most Americans fear riding in a self-driving car. "I can talk until I'm blue in the face about [autonomous vehicles] and I don't get a lot of response," Dediu said.

That‚Äôs the conclusion of Horace Dediu, a prominent analyst of disruptive technologies, who has spent the past three and a half years researching the future of transportation. Transportation is arguably the hottest frontier in the tech world. Innovators in Silicon Valley and beyond are spending billions to build flying cars and self-driving trucks. Tesla CEO Elon Musk talks of digging costly 30-level tunnel networks for cars. Google cofounder Sergey Brin reportedly has a giant airship. But as Dediu sees it, a familiar, unglamorous technology will own the future: the bicycle. And the big loser will be cars. ‚ÄúBikes have a tremendous disruptive advantage over cars. Bikes will eat cars,‚Äù Dediu told CNNTech, referencing investor Marc Andreessen‚Äôs seminal 2011 argument that software-driven businesses are dominating the world. Dediu points to the explosive growth of Chinese bikeshare systems as well as the versatility, low cost and efficiencies of shared bicycles. Bikeshare bikes of the future, according to Dediu, will be outfitted with cameras and sensors, collecting valuable data for cities. When a cyclist rides over a pothole, it can be automatically reported to a city. Cameras on the bicycle will provide real-time data, such as pedestrian traffic and pollution. Google Street View will look like an antique compared to near real-time imagery collected from bikeshare cameras. The bikes will need to be carefully constructed so that the cameras and sensors aren‚Äôt easily broken during use. Software and electrification are slowly transforming the auto industry. There‚Äôs talk of self-driving cars flooding streets in five or 10 years. It will likely take even longer for electric vehicles to go mainstream. Dediu argues that electric, connected bikes will arrive en masse before autonomous, electric cars. Riders will barely have to pedal as they whiz down streets once congested with cars. Bikes‚Äô flexible nature will aid their popularity. You can park a bicycle in your home or your office. A bike can be carried on a bus, car or train. A car doesn‚Äôt offer this versatility. A similar case of disruption played out with cameras, as the always-in-your-pocket nature of smartphones helped them leave traditional cameras in the dust. Bikes have another edge on cars ‚Äî speed. New York‚Äôs shared bicycles have already been shown to travel at a faster average speed than city taxis during peak hours. They‚Äôre also more affordable per mile. While the speed edge seen in New York today doesn‚Äôt hold up in every city, it will likely change as electric bicycles emerge. Electric bikes ‚Äî whose motors generally top out at 20 mph ‚Äî will attract customers because they don‚Äôt have to worry about breaking a sweat, struggling to climb a hill or keeping up with traffic. ‚ÄúWhen you get on an electric bike, what we witnessed is a lot of those anxieties are calmed,‚Äù said Elliott McFadden, executive director of the Austin B-Cycle, the city‚Äôs bikeshare program. It recently surveyed citizens‚Äô interest in electric bikes. ‚ÄúNormally if we introduce a group to bikeshare, maybe a third or half of people are interested.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Google celebrates Star Wars Day with discounts, playlists, recommendations By Ida Torres - May 5, 2017 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter As the whole geekdom celebrates Star Wars Day by flooding their friends‚Äô timelines with various #MayTheFourthBeWithYou posts, brands are taking this opportunity to remind you that they have Star Wars related products and contents. Of course Google has a lot of related things and so they‚Äôre taking this opportunity to remind people about the movies, games, books/comics that are available in their respective online stores. They are also offering special discounts on selected games as well as Star Wars-themed playlists on Google Play Music. According to Google, 2015‚Äôs episode VII, The Force Awakens is the most downloaded film of the Star Wars movies on Google Play, followed by last year‚Äôs Rogue One and then the Episodes 4-6 in 3rd-5th place (no mystery why Episodes 1-3 didn‚Äôt figure in the Top 5). When it comes to games, the Galaxy of Heroes is the most downloaded game, with Lego Star Wars Yoda II a surprise second. As for the books, Aftermath is the most downloaded with the novelization of The Force Awakens in second. Of course links to the Top 5 for each category are provided, in case you want to download them too. But in case you want to buy some of the Star Wars games, they are offering ‚Äúfun discounts‚Äù on Star Wars ‚Äúmust haves‚Äù from May 4-11. This includes the aforementioned Galaxy of Heroes, plus Force Arena and Pinball 5. If it‚Äôs music that floats your boat, they also have Star Wars-themed playlist on Google Play Music, which includes Star Wars‚Äô Finest, Cantina Band Swing, and the Galaxy of John Williams. Unfortunately, there are no mentions of the upcoming Episode VIII, The Last Jedi, which already has fans salivating when they released the first trailer a few weeks ago. But we still have 6 months to go anyway, so let‚Äôs prolong our agony shall we?

However, unlike most phishing attacks, this one can be particularly convincing thanks to the lengths the hackers have went to disguise it.

If the user chooses to allow access, the phish attack would begin and the contacts within the affected Google account will be used to launch additional attacks. Reddit While phishing attacks aren‚Äôt new to Google as a whole, this particular attack has turned out to be extremely effective due to how well crafted it is. The initial Google Docs invitation was created to be highly convincing, and the phishing attack also utilised the OAuth authentication interface to give the attack a sense of legitimacy to it. As such, those who are used to glancing at their emails would be extra susceptible to this attack. As meticulously crafted as this phishing attack is, this attack does contain signs that gives away its nature. For one, those who receive the email will find their address listed in the ‚ÄúBCC‚Äù field instead of the normal ‚ÄúTo‚Äù field. Secondly, the ‚ÄúTo‚Äù field will contain an email address that ends with ‚Äúmailinator.com‚Äù, although the most commonly used address appears to be ‚Äúhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh@mailinator.com‚Äù. Finally, the source of the shared document will appear as a long string of text that includes Google Docs-like web addresses. Arstechnica If you‚Äôre one of the many that unknowingly gave permission to the phishing email, it‚Äôs imperative that you head over to the Google accounts management page and revoke the permission for the Google Docs app. Thankfully, Google has since cracked down hard on this particular phishing attack, so it is unlikely that you‚Äôll be affected by it. That being said, knowing how tenacious some of the hackers out there can be, it would be wise to remain extra vigilant with the emails you receive.

Google has been busy this week, performing¬†several interesting tests including¬†two fairly major ones concerning hotel¬†reviews and job listings. Meanwhile, Bing makes its homepage a little more interactive, and Google has announced that Similar Audiences will be available for Search and Shopping in AdWords. Finally, one Googler put a persistent SEO myth about 404 pages to bed once and for all. Google is testing a new UI for hotel reviews Toronto SEO specialist Sergey Alakov discovered the test last week, exploring its implications in a post on his personal blog. The test shows a new review carousel that amalgamates reviews from third-party sources like Expedia and booking.com. There are a few changes to the review system too, with Google now displaying average scores for Room, Locations, and Services & Facilities. Clicking through to the reviews section also shows an average score for different types of traveler ‚Äì like Couples, Families, and Solo. Image courtesy of Sergey Alakov ‚Ä¶alongside a new Job Portal to help users find job listings SEO and Moz-affiliate Dan Shure broke the test via Twitter last Friday with a screenshot of a Knowledge Panel-esque feature for active job listings. Clicking through results in an expanded results page which allows segmentation by industry, title, type, location, company type and employer.

The scam was made possible by Google's open system, and raises serious, potentially irresolvable questions about how the company structures products. The first thing recipients saw was an email from¬†someone on¬†their contacts list, sent with¬†the familiar subject line "‚Ä¶has shared a document on¬†Google Docs with¬†you." From there, the email presented a line of¬†text ("‚Ä¶has invited you to¬†view the following¬†document"), followed by¬†an official-looking "Open in¬†Docs" button. If users took the bait, they would then be prompted to¬†log in¬†to Google anew¬†‚Äî and their contact lists would be duly harvested.

Moreover, Google converses with¬†users via¬†email, making it harder for¬†users to¬†tell when they receive a scam email. "We have taken action to¬†protect users against¬†an email impersonating Google Docs, and have disabled offending accounts. We've removed the fake pages, pushed updates through¬†Safe Browsing, and our abuse team is working to¬†prevent this kind of¬†spoofing from¬†happening again.

The attack's impact was arguably minor¬†‚Äî the millions of¬†indentikit emails being blasted out¬†did not go unnoticed by¬†Google's eagle-eyed administrators, and the scam was quickly neutered, with¬†the phony Google Docs extension blocked outright. There is no suggestion any passwords were actually compromised, but¬†even though the attack is estimated to¬†have affected less than¬†0.1 percent of¬†users, that equates to¬†as many as¬†a million people or more.

The measures include a warning from¬†Google when a user receives a phishing link, saying, "the site you are trying to¬†visit has been identified as¬†a forgery intended to¬†trick you into¬†disclosing financial, personal or other sensitive information."

BlackBerry KEYone review: A tale of a decent phone full of annoyances Jordan Palmer Follow View All Posts 2017/05/04 6:00am PDTMay 4, 2017 9 Plus 1 on G+ 19 Share on Facebook 47 Share on Twitter Total Shares75 Blackberry KEYone News Phone Reviews Reviews Article Contents 1 Specs 2 The Good 3 The Not So Good 4 Design & build¬†quality 5 Display 6 Battery life 7 Audio 8 Call quality & connectivity 9 Camera 10 Software 10.1 BlackBerry apps 10.2 Settings & general UI 10.3 Performance 11 Value 12 Conclusion The KEYone, the latest in the BlackBerry Ltd/TCL collaboration, is a phone that returns to the Canadian brand's iconic roots, for better or for worse. With Nougat and a strong focus on security, the KEYone is aimed at enterprise users and long-time fanatics. Overall, the spec sheet for this phone is nothing chart-topping. The SoC is over a year old at this point and the screen has been downgraded from the year-and-a-half-old Priv's, but using the KEYone was¬†mostly a pleasant experience until after about a week¬†with it. That was when I started experiencing rather noticeable slowdown and other problems. So what does a proverbial return to form for BlackBerry mean in the ever massive Android space? Well, there's not really a simple answer. But let's get going ‚Äî¬†we've got a lot to cover. You don't want to be here all day, do you? The unit that I've been using for the last week and some change¬†is pre-production. There have been a few hiccups with the software along the way, which I'll note in the appropriate section below. Most of these problems will hopefully¬†be fixed before the KEYone¬†is available for sale. Specs Display 4.5" IPS LCD 1620 x 1080; 434 ppi CPU Snapdragon 625 GPU Adreno 506 Software Android 7.1.1 Nougat; BlackBerry Security RAM 3GB Storage 32GB, expandable via microSD Cameras 12MP IMX378 (1.55Œºm) rear, 8MP front Battery 3,505mAh; Quick Charge 3.0 Misc USB Type-C 3.1, fingerprint sensor, 3.5mm jack, physical keyboard, NFC Connectivity 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac, dual-band; Bluetooth 4.2; LTE bands 1/2/3/4/5/7/12/13/20/25/26/28/29/30 Measurements 149.3 x 72.5 x 9.4 mm; 180 g Buy BlackBerry The Good Software The "stock" take on Android with BlackBerry's apps is great. It feels like what Motorola does: functionality added on top of Google's vision. It has the latest security patch and Android 7.1.1. Battery life My time with phones from the likes of Huawei and Xiaomi has somewhat desensitized me to stellar battery life, but the KEYone is definitely above average. Screen The color accuracy, brightness, and viewing angles are spectacular. The screen crisp and more than adequate, despite its odd size and aspect ratio. Fingerprint sensor I am not sure from where the fingerprint sensor was sourced, but it's almost on Huawei's level for speed and accuracy. Seriously, my success rate has been almost perfect. Build quality The KEYone is one hell of a solid device. The aluminium frame combined with the soft-touch back make the phone feel extremely durable. The Not So Good Ergonomics/weight The KEYone is chunky and is a bit difficult to hold. Typing with one hand on¬†the physical keyboard is also a pain. And even though it's only 180 grams, the KEYone feels very dense and heavy. Using it single-handed is not a pleasant experience for long periods. Speaker I know this should go without saying, but the speaker quality¬†on this phone is pretty terrible. Performance Major lag, homescreen redraws, and RAM management issues led to a phone that, after about a week of use, became almost unusable. Design & build¬†quality To give you some perspective on the KEYone and its design,¬†the marketing materials say that the phone is "Distinctly different. Distinctly BlackBerry." That last part, and to an extent the first, is quite true. BlackBerry (well, it's really TCL, but you know what I mean) has opted for what you might call the quintessential look that defined the heyday of Research In Motion. And while that seems like a negative at first glance, the KEYone's design exhibits¬†some modernization in its overall execution. This phone garnered more looks, comments, and questions in my time with it than any other I've used¬†‚Äî I'd say that it comes close to the amount of attention I received when smartwatches were still young. The physical keyboard is what drew people's eyes. The whole front face would throw anyone for a loop, especially when we're starting to see such high screen-to-body ratios these days. Not a single person that I've come across thinks that this is a pretty device... and I agree with them. The KEYone is not beautiful, elegant, slim, or anything else like that; it is aimed at a niche that, in theory, cares little for those things in a pocket computer. From the back, the phone looks fairly unassuming and normal. The soft-touch finish¬†feels¬†like it was ripped off of the good ol' OG Nexus 7. My fingertips glide across the band-aid texture, but when push comes to shove, my hand grips it solidly. Coupled with an aluminium frame, the KEYone feels sturdy, durable... and like a brick. To put this¬†kindly, it is one hell of a chunky phone¬†‚Äî I actually had 2010-2011 phone era flashbacks when I removed it¬†from the box. At 180 grams (6.35 ounces for you Imperial folks), the KEYone gets quite heavy in the hand after prolonged usage. See, I have this odd tendency to support phones with my little finger¬†while I'm using them; BlackBerry has made me decide to try to break that habit. I know that I mentioned it briefly, but let's talk seriously about the KEYone's keyboard. When smartphones were starting to trend toward on-screen keyboards, I was not happy. I liked the tactile response of my Droid and Droid 2, and haptic feedback was just not as satisfying. I had also not learned to type without looking on my G1 or HTC Hero, a problem I did not have with any of my Droids or BlackBerries. I eventually got over myself and became a solid fan of SwiftKey and the navbar¬†that Google brought to Android with Ice Cream Sandwich. Now that I'm all done reminiscing, let's get back to the topic at hand. The KEYone's backlit keyboard is really good, if not a little weird after spending the last several years with a¬†software variant. If I were a keyboard nerd like Ryan, I'd describe the travel distance, tactile feel, and the like ‚Äî I¬†just like my gaming mice and PC hardware. While the keys are much too small for my taste, I found that I actually had very few errors in general usage. Each one is easily pressed and responds with a solid click. The layout is obviously QWERTY (duh), so it's pretty easy to get to the point where you're typing fairly quickly. So far, the only things that have taken me some time to adjust to are the symbol layout and the placement of the left shift key versus ALT. Most of my errors have been activating the alternative mode instead of capitalizing the next letter. If you're into it, there are 52 programmable keyboard shortcuts that can open apps or contacts. For instance, you could assign a long press of 'c' to open Chrome, 'f' to start up Facebook, and so on. There's one catch, though: it's limited to the BlackBerry Launcher. In any other, long-pressing a letter will bring up a phone search for shortcuts and apps that are associated with that key. One of the other interesting features is the flick gesture, which inserts the first SwiftKey-like prediction when you, well, flick your thumb up the board. My biggest gripe about the keyboard is the fact that I have to see¬†it every¬†time that I am using the phone. Whereas the Priv has the sliding mechanism to mask its keyboard when you aren't using it, the KEYone's stares you in the face. This reduces the screen size to 4.5" and a 3:2 aspect ratio. I understand that this design choice was made¬†in the spirit of the BlackBerries of old, but I can't say that I am a fan. And if you don't like the physical keyboard or just don't want to use it all of the time, you can use the software version. However, unlike the Priv, this is not the best option. A full-screen keyboard on this smaller display is not the most pleasant of experiences. The fingerprint sensor is fantastic. Embedded in the space bar, it's lightning quick and very accurate. Only Huawei's sensors have proven so reliable for me, which should tell you something. The front of the phone has the screen, the capacitive navigation buttons, the keyboard, and the front camera (and earpiece/sensors) along the upper aluminium bezel. The back has the rather large camera module (there's still a hump, by the way, despite this thing being a brick) and BlackBerry logo. On the top of the frame, you will find the 3.5mm headphone jack. The left side only has the power button, while the bottom houses the speaker grilles and the USB Type-C 3.1 port. Finally, the right side is home to the SIM tray, volume rocker (which feels cheap and hollow) and what BlackBerry calls the "Convenience Key." Both it and the power button feel only slightly more solid than the volume rocker and I'd honestly rather see¬†one of them be textured or differentiated in some way from the other. Just because they're on opposite sides of the phone does not mean I didn't mix them up from time to time. The Convenience Key is a tertiary button that is customizable and can be mapped to almost any action you want. It can open a certain app, activate one of many shortcuts, or perform a few system functions like power off. At this moment, I have it mapped to Google Now since Assistant is tied to a long press of the home button. Let's just say that I've opened Now a lot more than I usually do. It's cool to see BlackBerry trying to¬†cater in some form to power users by adding in this key. At least this isn't chained to a useless virtual assistant. Overall, the KEYone is well-built, but it is a polarizing device in its design and construction. Some people will love it, while I think that most won't. It doesn't have the sneaky, incognito aspect that the Priv did, which is not necessarily a bad thing. Whether you like the look of the phone or not is entirely up to you¬†‚Äî I'm just not the biggest fan of it. Display When discussing the KEYone's display, most will inevitably focus on the aspect ratio, i.e. its general shape. BlackBerry went with something decidedly more square than what most of us are used to. Despite this, the 1620x1080 IPS panel is crisp, clear, and quite bright. I am rather¬†fond of the color reproduction, and I found this to be one of the more accurate panels that I've used. There's even an sRGB mode. The viewing angles are superb and the screen is just a joy to look at. It also gets very bright for outdoor use. The display is not the KEYone's strongest aspect, but nor is it the weakest. The resolution is more than adequate especially given the total screen size. There really isn't that much more to say on the matter: great screen, awesome colors, but it won't blow you away. Battery life With a 3,505mAh battery, you'd expect the KEYone to last a long time. I mean, that's one of the features that BlackBerry is hoping encourages¬†people to buy this phone. The good news is that it is certainly above average. After using Huawei and Xiaomi devices for the last few months, I have gotten used to a phone that can easily get me through a day, so I am glad that this one¬†continues the trend. During my testing, I had the screen at 100% brightness with plenty of texting, emailing, messaging, and several attempts to¬†watch YouTube videos and play games. Not only did I get over five hours of screen-on-time, but the idle drain on the battery was practically negligible. The largest battery to ever come in a BlackBerry phone and the screen resolution help to contribute to the¬†claim that you can get 26 hours of "mixed use," but if you run low, Qualcomm's Quick Charge 3.0 is supported. When you plug the phone in, you are presented with two options: Charge Only¬†and Boost Mode. The latter is touted as "giving you the most efficient charge possible, even if you only have a few minutes." Good on BlackBerry for making another phone with good battery life. It's pretty damn stellar. Audio When I¬†think of a BlackBerry, I don't always picture a phone with the best sound quality and output. Sure, it might get the job done, but you know what I mean. In all fairness, the KEYone is not meant to be your media player¬†‚Äî rather, it's not supposed to be the one on your desk that pleases your ears the most. It gets the job done, that's about all I can say. The sound that pushes out of the headphone jack is tolerable and works just fine for the gym or other activities where you won't be lugging around high fidelity cans. The external speaker is subpar, even considering that this is a smartphone. For music or notifications, there is plenty of distortion and crackling at 80%+ volume. The cacophony at that level is awful, so I've left the KEYone in vibrate-only most of the time. At least the phone has a good vibration motor. Call quality & connectivity When I first received the KEYone and inserted my SIM card, I was sorely unimpressed. Mobile data would not work due to a problem with the APN settings and the phone presented me with an annoying notification telling me that there was a problem. After some digging and chatting with "people in the know," I found out that this was a known issue with this¬†pre-production build of the software and it was being addressed in preparation for the final release. After manually setting up the APN for my MVNO carrier, my wireless connectivity has been passable. Call quality reached my expectations¬†‚Äî Bluetooth and WiFi have also been reliable. I have had my LG Watch Urbane (Android Wear 2.0), Moto 360, and Samsung Gear S3 connected to it during my entire usage. None have had any issues staying connected, nor did I have trouble with any of the Bluetooth headsets I tried. Reception, however, was another matter entirely. The phone constantly dropped calls or failed to make them at all. I also frequently lost data connection or experienced slower speeds than what I am used to on my carrier. The KEYone also experienced cell signal holes that have never been there¬†‚Äî I went through a hole near my house every day, but all of my other devices were just fine in the same area (same SIM, etc). It was extremely frustrating. Camera I'll admit: I went into all of this not expecting much from the camera. Come on, it's a BlackBerry. But seriously, the KEYone's is legitimately good. It performs well in low-light environments with post-processing that is kind to photos. I'm certainly glad to see BlackBerry carry on where the Priv's camera left off. With all of that being said, it cannot¬†quite¬†hold its own next to¬†the Pixel, GS8/GS7, or even the P10. The KEYone can put out good-quality pictures that are crisp in detail, but with some aggressive smoothing in post-processing.¬†Those of you who pay attention will notice that the KEYone packs the same sensor as the Pixel, the IMX378. While that certainly can lend itself to good photos, it's not the be-all, end-all. My opinion is that this is one of those phones where it's more difficult to take a bad picture. This camera is like a jack-of-all-trades¬†‚Äî you'll get great outdoor, indoor, and nighttime photos. Will they have that so-called "Wow!" factor? Well, that depends on you. Moving around to the front, BlackBerry opted for an 8MP fixed focus, 84¬∞ wide angle shooter. LCD flash is also included. Supposedly, this is best suited for those video conferences where you're not in a position to get somewhere with better lighting. This is the official blurb on the matter: "For times when you have to take a video conference on the go, the device includes an 8MP front camera with fixed focus, LCD flash, and 84-degree wide angle lens." Just own up to the fact that you put in an LCD flash for selfies; there's nothing wrong with that. Wrapping all of this up, let's go over the camera UI. It's basic, but in a good way. In Auto, you are presented with the upper bar that has the settings for flash, timer, aspect ratio, and HDR, as well as¬†the general options. Along the bottom is the gallery preview, front/rear camera switcher, shutter button, mode selection, and visual effects. In the options, you have the control mode, where you choose between auto and manual. Then there's the JPEG fine or standard compression choices, face detection, and video resolution stuff. The KEYone¬†can go all the way up to 4K30fps, but you lose "enhanced video stabilization" above 1080p30, which is kind of a bummer. Contrast this camera app UI with something from Huawei and you'll see why I am a huge fan. There aren't as many options, but what's there is useful and mostly necessary. Good job, BlackBerry. Previous Next Software When the Priv launched a year and a half ago, the general consensus seemed to be that the software was good. Much like Motorola and OnePlus, BlackBerry has gone with a "stock+" take on Android, i.e. where Google's vision is kept intact, but useful features are added on top to better the user experience. The KEYone follows the same logic, though with Nougat 7.1.1 running underneath¬†this time around. The BlackBerry brand is built on security, reliability, and stability. When the company shifted over to Android from the corpse that was BB OS, it brought with it some of the hallmarks upon which it had built its reputation. There was a commitment to updating to¬†the latest monthly security patches, the DTEK security suite, and even some hardware modifications that all helped to ensure users had the safest and most secure take on Android. Now we're here with the KEYone and that focus is still on-point. On the surface, the software looks like stock Android, but there's a bunch running under the hood, from the apps to the settings and options. I'll go through both¬†of those elements in their own sub-sections to follow. I think you'll be as surprised as I was in regard to the level of depth and detail with each addition made. Not all of it is useful, in my opinion, but it's there. BlackBerry apps This is one of the pillars for¬†BlackBerry's plan to draw potential customers. My time with BlackBerry's¬†phones was so long ago that I hardly remember what BB OS was like (and I never even used v10). Even if I did, I can tell you right now that I was not a hardcore user, so the KEYone gave me my first experience with a lot of the apps that BlackBerry loyalists swear by. The Hub app is where it's at, at least in terms of sheer power user capability. This functions as a place where you can see all of your messages, emails, texts, and other related¬†notifications. It pulls from Gmail, your default SMS app, IM services, and various social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, and LinkedIn. Due to the volume of incoming emails and the email-fu that I am forced to do each day, I ignore Gmail in Hub. It was just too difficult since it still doesn't support the tabbed inbox or filters/labels as well as I'd like. You can also set up custom views for Hub, where you select what accounts will show up¬†‚Äî this is how I was able to successfully "ignore" Gmail. For enterprise users, this could be the way you separate your work and personal data. While this is all great, I frankly got bored when trying to make Hub work to my advantage. It can take a lot of work, time, and effort to get it the way you want it. I have no doubt that some people will do this, because there is much power to be had in the app, but it is not for everyone. ¬† Nipping at the heels¬†of Hub in terms of marketing importance, we have DTEK. Though it's still being hyped just like it was when the Priv launched, it¬†remains a mostly useless, feel-good example of the placebo effect. You're presented with red Xs, yellow exclamation points, and green check-marks that denote your level of security in various areas. It's a centralized location to show the average user the basics of Android security, which isn't a bad thing. I suppose I am shrugging it off because I know what I'm doing when it comes to this stuff and my perfectionist/completionist nature hates not seeing green check marks. Since I am not going to change my usage habits, then I might as well not look at annoying yellow exclamation points. For those of you who are wondering what my DTEK status is, I am sitting firmly at "Fair." As annoying as that is, at least I am using¬†a BlackBerry device (because that's one of the security checks). I can sleep a bit better tonight knowing that. If you hit green on all criteria, then your needle will be in the "Excellent" range on the gauge. Good for you. ¬† DTEK is actually worth a damn when it comes to showing what apps are accessing certain permissions and notifying you when they do. Or¬†you can have it¬†inform you when a specific application is requesting certain permissions. For example, I can tell DTEK to let me know¬†when something accesses my calendar or to notify¬†me when Action Launcher alone tries to read it. There are certain people who will love this¬†‚Äî I am not one of them. BBM is here, for some reason. It's still the same old app and I really don't feel like going over it. Basically, if you use BBM then you know what it is. If you don't, you're not missing much. There's still no SMS functionality; Android¬†Messages is your default out of the box. The Calendar app is cool, I guess. It still has the "Meeting Mode," which automatically silences your phone when you're in a meeting according to your calendar. There are also options for creating events in different time zones from the system one and whether or not the app informs you if events conflict. It's a neat take, but I wouldn't call it special. Finally, there are various note-taking, task, password management, and photo markup apps. None are particularly worth paying attention to¬†and I am sure there are better offerings from either Google or other third-party developers. I don't want to waste too much time with them. Settings & general UI Apps are great and all, but what about overall user interface? Like I said, the software is "stock+" Android. It looks, feels, and functions much like Nougat would on a Nexus or Pixel, but there are additional options¬†to play with. Most of them lie in the display settings menu, so I'll address some of them. There's the color balance slider (for cool or warm, or somewhere in between) How you want the Recents menu to look ‚Äî you have the choice of Rolodex, which is the normal way, Tiles, and Masonry A green bar along the edge of the screen that shows the battery level¬†remaining while charging (it's neat and I've seen it before in custom ROMs) An option to double tap to wake/sleep the phone. There's one final piece that I want to address in more detail. It's called the Productivity Tab and it exists as a small white bar on the far right edge of the screen (its position and thickness can be adjusted). If you've used Action Launcher and the Quickpage feature, then that's basically¬†how this works. If you have no idea what I'm talking about, the Productivity Tab pulls out from the side of the screen and has five sections. The first is a calendar widget showing you what you have going on that day or the next. After that¬†is a Hub shortcut to show you any unread messages. Sections 3 and 4 are a todo and contacts list, respectively. Finally, there's a settings sub-menu for the Tab, where you adjust position, transparency, height, thickness, etc. I like the Productivity Tab for little more than the calendar widget, which is exactly what I use the Quickpage for in my default Action Launcher setup. ¬†¬† The other addition you'll see in the system settings is for the Convenience Key, which I mentioned all the way back up closer to the top of this review. It's the thing under the volume rocker that looks/feels exactly like the power button. Oh, yeah, you can map it to open whatever app or shortcut you want. I find it mostly useless. but some may find it to their liking. The sub-menu itself is pretty straightforward: it shows you what the key does, what action is currently assigned to it, the option to clear said action, and a short list of what you can map to it. Here's what's available to choose: "Open app" will bring up a list of everything you have installed "Speed dial" allows you to set a contact to the key (don't do this) "Send message" allows you to open either an email or a text to send to a specific contact "All shortcuts" brings up a long list of all the shortcuts that BlackBerry thinks you could ever use/need. Once you make your choice, that's what the Convenience Key will do until you select something else. It only works when the screen is on and unlocked, so keep that in mind. There's a gestures section, but it only has the toggle for the double-tap power button for camera shortcut. Not sure why this is off on¬†its own, but whatever. The sound settings still has the "Notify during calls" and "Flip to mute" options¬†‚Äî I disabled the former because who needs that. The security area is actually almost stock, except for the picture password. By the way, skip that, too. Developer options has the sRGB mode toggle I mentioned earlier (which always turns itself off when I back out of the menu), but it's missing the OEM unlock entry. Because this is BlackBerry, so no unlocking or rooting for you. Everything else is all the same as a Nexus or Pixel. BlackBerry Launcher, the default out of the box, is pretty basic. You have the option for those keyboard shortcuts and little else of note. After I toyed around with it for a bit, I moved¬†on to Action Launcher. The notification shade and Quick Settings are also just like stock with the same animations and everything. ¬† If you're super paranoid about people peering¬†over your shoulder to look at the stuff on your screen, BlackBerry provides you with the Privacy Shade (via the Play Store). This prevents others¬†from physically seeing private and sensitive content by blocking out everything except for a tiny viewing area. How big this little window is depends on what size you want, but even with Privacy Shade active, you can still interact with your screen. It's neat, I suppose. You can adjust the shape and background transparency via the little menu that appears when the Shade is active. Performance The Snapdragon 625 powering all of this is not too bad of a chip. Though decidedly midrange and a year old at this point, it carried the KEYone along better than I would have thought initially. However, after about a week, the lags, stutters, and hiccups started to settle in, with the most noticeable being¬†exiting the camera app, constant homescreen redraws, and apps not remaining in memory very well. The camera thing was especially bad when I used the power button shortcut to launch the camera from a locked state; exiting after this caused the phone to hang for almost thirty seconds. Following that, there'd be another forty-five seconds of unresponsiveness, even from the fingerprint sensor or power button. Suffice to say, it was quite annoying and dismaying. I am not sure whether this is a bug in the pre-production software or not; regardless, it was irritating¬†and made using that shortcut more than useless. As time went on, the sheer sluggishness of the phone became quite apparent. Animations would lag, the whole OS would hang when launching apps at random intervals, and my homescreen redrew¬†every time I went back home (I used BlackBerry, Action, and Nova Launcher¬†‚Äî all with the same result). I also experienced some seriously aggressive RAM management/problems. As an example, I opened a new app for the first time and needed to sign in. I knew my password, but needed my 2FA code. Switching over to Authy, I grabbed the code and double-tapped the recents button to switch back to the original app... only to find that it needed to reload, requiring my credentials again. After all of that, the 2FA code had expired. Rinse and repeat; I just used Authy on my PC to get signed in after a near instance of rage quitting. That's just a singular example, but things like that happened often. Geekbench 4 was having troubles The Adreno 506 GPU¬†is pretty capable, though. The only problem is that there is no reason to game on this phone¬†‚Äî not only is the screen quite small for such an activity, but the keyboard and overall design of the phone's face make gaming uncomfortable. The GPU is just¬†wasted potential, I'd say. These issues could be related to this pre-production hardware and software, but there was a point at which the KEYone became unusable. These problems persisted through reboots. Performance for the first several days was quite good, but it deteriorated very rapidly. Surprisingly so, actually, which made the disappointment I felt seem worse. I should note that I will be retesting everything¬†with a production model when the phone¬†is released to see if these issues persist. Value As we near the end of this journey review, I'm left with a few¬†questions. The one I will ask and hopefully answer in this penultimate section is this: Is the KEYone worth it? Besides the horribly stylized name and physical keyboard, what is the value proposition of this phone? It will retail for $549 USD, which puts it at the high end of the midrange spectrum. That's still a hefty sum for a year-old SoC and some very fast performance degradation, even though both of those¬†come with a decent screen, good camera, and awesome overall software experience. Even with all of the security stuff and the keyboard, I am not entirely convinced that $549 is a good price. $349 is probably the most that I would pay for this phone, especially when you consider that a Pixel is $100 more than the asking price ($650) or that a OnePlus 3T starts at $440. Both phones come with better internals, a similar overall UI/UX, and better¬†cameras. What makes the MSRP even more painful is the subpar performance (note: again, this could be related to the pre-production hardware/software), something that I cannot in good conscience ignore or fail to mention in this regard. You will be much happier with what OnePlus, Google, and even Samsung have to offer you. BlackBerry is likely going to aim this at the enterprise, which may not care about the price tag as much as us normal consumers. Those users, however, do want a phone that's going to work well no matter what they're doing. The long and short of it is that if you're considering this phone as one of your options, then I'd say go with the OnePlus 3T as the best value for your money; if your budget is a little more flexible, then go with a Pixel or Galaxy S8. If you're really interested in one of these, just wait until they go on sale. Conclusion So who is the KEYone for, exactly? According to¬†BlackBerry, it's meant for: "people who use their phones more for communication rather than media consumption, people who are tired of having the same one¬†as everyone else, people who are professionals and rely on their phone to get things done, and people who are looking for something¬†durable that will last through a busy day." If you want my opinion (and you did just read this whole thing, so why wouldn't you), I would say that the KEYone is for the BlackBerry power user of yore. I never was one, but I do know a few who still¬†talk about their old phones. This phone is for them. Minus the DTEK50 and DTEK60, the KEYone is BlackBerry's (and TCL's) latest real attempt at the Android side of things since the Priv. From my time with it, the KEYone failed at providing a good user experience, even¬†though it is¬†a little eccentric and anachronistic in a cute way. BlackBerry returned to its roots with this phone, its aim fixed squarely on the¬†fans of old. Personally, I happen to prefer the glass slabs that we have nowadays and I think that the KEYone is a relic of a long bygone age. I eventually adjusted¬†to the form factor and physical keyboard, but even after reaching that point, I still did not enjoy typing (versus my current neutral feeling on the matter with the software versions). Simply put, I do not like the KEYone. I do, however, appreciate a solid, well-built device even if it is a brick. But good construction is only a single criterion when evaluating a device for recommendation and I don't think that the average consumer or even an Android nerd would enjoy using this phone. It's kind of ugly, bulky, dense, and one of the main draws, the keyboard, is a novelty at best. This is definitely a niche product and I usually frown on that because it's so limiting¬†‚Äî honestly, that's probably just the business student in me talking. BlackBerry/TCL clearly have a target market for the KEYone that they believe is slavering for it¬†(I am certainly not in it). That being said, narrowing down to a specific demographic does not excuse a poor user experience. I've said it plenty of times in this review, but I'll say it again: I know that the model I have¬†is pre-production hardware and software. Bugs, janks, and other oddities are to be expected. There was supposed to be an update for the review units, but I have not received it as of this writing. I like what the KEYone is trying to be and do.¬†It's a quirky little thing that was actually fun to use sometimes just because it's so different. The "stock+" Android¬†is also quite refreshing and helped to subdue some of my frustrations early on. But being unique with great¬†software cannot carry a phone through the trials that this phone presented. And no, the irony of this is not lost on me¬†‚Äî I usually get the phones with outstanding hardware and bogus software. The Snapdragon 625 is a decent chip in its own right; on paper, I should have never had the problems I did. Odds are, either you have already decided that you want one of these or your company's IT department will purchase them in bulk. In both of those cases, I wish you the best and hope that you have the best experience that this phone has to offer. Perhaps the issues I've had will be fixed with production hardware or a few software updates down the line, or maybe it's all been down to bad luck in the silicon lottery (#jordansluck). But I just have a feeling that the KEYone will go down as one of those Android phones that has a cult following, but is ultimately worth more in a few years as an antique than as a daily driver today.

It probably has its niche, but I agree that the era of the keyboard phone has passed, and for good reason. I'll take my big screen and easy one-handed typing, and honestly, I sincerely doubt I would ever be faster on a hardware keyboard. We're all so used to software boards and such autocomplete wizards that I bet 90% of people out there would never get close to matching their speed with a touchscreen on one of these chiclet boards. I also don't really think the camera seems like anything all that special, at least based on the samples here. Nick Becker Honestly, the physical keyboard was the only reason I was considering getting one of these. What I really want, though, is a new version of the HTC G2/Desire Z. YaKillaCJ I still have 1 in a drawer somewhere. That device was awesome and innovative. Hmm, maybe if HTC should look into the keyboard. Nick Becker I still have mine, too. It's just too old now for modern apps. Good_Ole_Pinocchio Phone with a 625... If you're not getting the Z Play, you're doing it wrong.... And well I completely agree with you on hardware keyboards being ridiculous in 2017 robogo Lenovo P2. Same specs, 5100 mAh battery. steadymobb Will the p2 ever get 7.0 though? Prob not... Sohit Especially considering the LG G6 is on sale for $500 Francois Nguyen I actually HATE most touchscreen keyboards, even if if's for typing small messages. I even hated landscape mechanical keyboards because I always break the sliding mechanism over time -_-. Being used to portrait mechanical keyboards (and old PC keyboards from the 90s) for so long, the only cellphones that lasted for me were a BB Q10 for 2 years (and a Palm Treo 680 for 5 years before that). I abused the heck out of Android Runtime for gathering my most needed apps. I tried iOS for 1 year and never got used to the keyboard. I tried several Android phones that didn't last 3 months for me. I'm glad now that the KEYone will show up in June 2017, even if it's WAY too late for me and I'm ironically not interested in buying it lol. Jack ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà mostly nostalgia. Honestly I will buy it if the price drops to $400 level YaKillaCJ My bet is the lags are due to stock 7.1.1. The 625 is very capable of everyday task proven by other OEMs. Something Xiaomi's Miui has a huge advantage over nearly everyone, optimization while including plethora of features. Proven by the Redmi Note 3 Pro (SD650) and Redmi Note 4x (SD625). Plus this price is just too much and I said it when it was announced. Yet so many nay sayers were upset at my comment siting its niche product. While a Niche allows it to be sold for more than Xiaomi and Huawei offerings, it doesn't justify pricing past Flagship specs. This cost more than OnePlus 3/T, ZTE Axon 7 & Xiaomi Mi5 that offer Flagship specs/hardware, thriving OEMs and update history. Not to mention Miui and OxygenOS. Blackberry should drop the price and use Android 7.0 instead until Google themselves stabilize Android 7.1.x. Miku is Best Vocaloid I don't think it's an issue with the Android version. My Moto Z Play has been running LineageOS ever since it became official and I haven't encountered any lag issues, even after a few weeks. If an unofficial version of 7.1 can run perfectly on the 625, there's no reason OEM 7.1 can't run properly on it. YaKillaCJ My key words were stock. As in they never optimized the Android software. Great examples is how Miui and OxygenOS takes whatever version and clearly tweak and optimize it. So I'm not surprised LOS runs great, it includes a modified/optimized kernel, drivers, blobs, default apps, etc tailored for your device. Throwing straight up stock versions of Android that basically just runs without optimization nor bug fixes is something TCL is known for. Look at Blu for example. HabsSuck what a hate on commentary, come to expect it from some HumbleButBlunt Although I agree with your comment I find it hilarious coming from someone who's screen name is "HabsSuck". DEVVVV Too bad BlackBerry continues to do what got them in trouble in the first place. this is due to total lack of innovation. Blackberry was a one hit wonder and if they don't get someone in there that possesses innovation they are done. HumbleButBlunt They are already done making devices... Nate650 Total lack of innovation!? This phone showcases innovation in many ways, such as the capacitive keyboard which they have a patent on. The same can't be said about the popular iPhone. All Apple has basically done in the last five generations is change the screen size. Michael Tran Does it have always listening "ok google" That would be a dealbreaker for me if it doesn't have it. Pat Richardson Your reasoning about the keyboard does not work for me. "Easy one hand typing" isn't even a thing anymore now that phones are 5.5" to 6" and touch/swype (word prediction selected "tofu") is a pain because of poor predictions. Since there is only one small flag ship phone (Sony xperis compact) one hand typing shouldn't even be an argument against a physical keyboard, which is more accurate, quick, and does not require looking at the keys. Every other word on swipe I swear I have to rewrite because of horrible predictions. And touch doing is no better since you cannot feel the keys I agree with everything else toy said about the phone though. Marcelove Start using Swiftkey and stop complaining...üòâ Pat Richardson That's funny because that's what I'm using ToniCipriani ‚úìp«ù·¥â…ü·¥â…π«ù å I used it. It's sh1t. As with every other bajillion VKB out there. I don't need keyboards that try to learn and output what it thinks I'm typing. I need a keyboard to output what I type, nothing more. Capacitive screens are inherently inaccurate. Imparus The size isn't really an argument when it comes to keyboard, pretty much every keyboard support "one hand" mode, where you can make it smaller, so even if it is big you can still reach all the letters with one hand. Pat Richardson While I can concede to this, phones are no longer small enough for one-hand general use. Trying to tap that top right button with your left hand puts you at risk of dropping your phone, so you mostly operate your phone with two hands anyway. To make a keyboard smaller for one hand typing is counter-intuitive for a screen size that's more operable with two hands. Maybe during situational uses the one handed mode is fine. Anyway, despite this argument the physical keyboard I find is much more accurate and comfortable than touch typing. Chris Oh "LCD" flash??? David Ruddock The screen flashes white. DEVVVV the screen flashes white?? So that must mean only for selfies. what if I am doing a recording? and want to see how it is recording in real time?? ecnjnr Tbmobn fby Uo B Mayoo Did it hurt when you fell on your keyboard? Kieron Quinn Maybe they just put their KEYone in their pocket ecnjnr 6P ;) ecnjnr My virtual keyboard posted this from my pocket, lol. Can't wait for a physical keyboard phone. Mayoo http://whatyearisit.info/img/what_year_is_it.jpg ecnjnr 2017 :) Miku is Best Vocaloid There's something called "locking" you may have heard of it :^) Cinj Still don't understand why BB dumped their own OS in favor of Android, especially since BB10 was capable of running Android apps. That's like buying a Mac just to format the drive and put Windows on it, what's the point? I bought my mom a Blackberry Classic and it's a great little phone especially for more tech challenged people who don't need or want all the bells and whistles that come with the two major players. If BB is going to shift to just making mediocre Android phones, they may as well close up shop already. Francois Nguyen Some reasons I guess (based on my own experience with BBOS 10): - Software AND hardware issues on double-tapping on the hardware keyboard - lack of apps - lack of support from major players (facebook, BB itself) Cinj My response to each point: - No opinion since I haven't encountered this - 99% of apps are garbage so no big deal - You can't as easily help clog the internet with pics of the unimpressive food you just ate, unfunny memes, and "like, share, and type amen or you're going to hell" spam? How will humanity survive??? - Quite the opposite. BB is way less obtuse in it's interface than the constantly changing Android one. Android and it's apps are like a hieroglyphic tile puzzle that keeps getting shuffled with every update. Try teaching a tech illiterate parent how to operate Android, I dare you. - Neither of those really have a distinct advantage over the other. But it's nice to have options all the same. - See previous opinion on apps Not trying to slam you or anything, just giving my take. I think we need more options in the marketplace, not less. That's really my main gripe. But I know that's a fantasy because people generally gravitate towards a duality, so for now we're stuck with iOS and Android until some paradigm shift occurs. Francois Nguyen My responses to your responses lol: - it's not a widespread issue; it's not surprising a lot of people didn't know about it - that 1 % of good and varied apps is what everyone I know (tech illiterate or not) makes the switch to iOS or Android so I wouldn't ignore that - I agree with you on your statement. Most consumers disagree on this, though... My friends ABSOLUTELY need to tell the world what they eat for supper and what they read when they're in the bathroom, for example. - Most people that tried my BB Q10 or any Z10 in kiosk ABSOLUTELY disagree with your statement. They're all biased towards iOS or Android, I know (me too, BTW). But that's how sad the situation is when BB got too late to the consumer market. There's no incentive to switch OS. About teaching Android to a tech illiterate, I always did that to several 65+ years people in my neighborhood who never touched a PC in their daily life because it's too complicated for them. In short, BB OS = complicated, Android = easy, iOS = too easy. YMMV. - That's not a big issue now for developers. It's gonna be an issue when most apps (garbage or not) require Kitkat or later. Lack of incentive for devs = lack of enthusiasm for the platform. Winston Compatibility =/= native support. android apps run TERRIBLY on BB10 Cinj To be fair, most Android apps run terribly on Android too. And you're really not missing anything if you're unable to run most of the schlock that infests the play store anyway. Metallinatus Android apps have Google Play Services on Android, which is essential for a hell load of apps to work.... DEVVVV Chen ruined BlackBerry HumbleButBlunt Looks like the stock market disagrees with you. Nate650 The answer is simple: it didn't sell well and the lack of an ecosystem. Being able to run Android apps is not the same as having access to Google Play. ecnjnr I hope Blackberry resolves the performance issues by launch, or I'm reconsidering my purchase. Thanks for the review Jordan Palmer You and me both. ToniCipriani ‚úìp«ù·¥â…ü·¥â…π«ù å I'm just curious if you guys ever got updates. Some other reviewers stated they got at least 3 updates after receiving the review unit. Jordan Palmer I received a single update after this review went live. So far, it has only fixed some of my cell connectivity issues. Nothing else. Suicide_Note Even if they do that, it's still a mediocre phone. ecnjnr I'm a fan of physical keyboards. This phone is a Moto Z Play with a slightly bigger battery, a newer version of Android, a better camera and a physical keyboard. That's worth $100 to me, but maybe not for you. freshprince_87 Moto Z Play has a bigger battery Nate650 Bigger by a whopping 5 mAh. Miku is Best Vocaloid You can wait for the Moto Mod that will have a physical keyboard. ToniCipriani ‚úìp«ù·¥â…ü·¥â…π«ù å If they do a portrait version that is. Martin Rios Dude it depends on the market... Yeah say that "virtual keyboards are better than physical keyboards, swipe, etc.) but there are some folks that are waiting for the rise (or maybe it's the hype) for these kind of devices. Also another point is this sentence >>> "people who use their phones more for communication rather than media consumption, people who are tired of having the same one as everyone else, people who are professionals and rely on their phone to get things done, and people who are looking for something durable that will last through a busy day" >>> I'M ONE OF THEM. I can give less than a f*ck about aesthetics, ceramic look and all that crap, what I want is to be able to comfortably reply my company emails, open docs, scan paperwork, take crisp photos on the field and not sweating the cold if the phone ever slips from my hand (which I doubt). Sure phone must pass through IT Dept to block lost of sh!t like social media but I have my personal phone for that. I'm hoping a OEM in the near future release a phone with nowadays hardware and inspired by a Nokia E7-00, by the way that's my company device (I rejected a trashy Samsung Grand Prime the company tried to make me use, instead I went to Ebay and got a cheap yet efficient Nokia with a horizontal keyboard, Symbian, a decent camera and EAS capabilities). Nate650 Yea, it's a big issue. I still experience performance issues on my Priv. The Priv would be such an amazing device if they address those issues, but it's already been over a year old and they haven't. Do employees even use their own phones? They have to know about these issues by now. Kawshik Ahmed Does the stock 'Blackberry Launcher' supports Android 7.1's 'Launcher Shortcuts' or you have to use a 3rd party launcher ?? Muzaffar I don't understand that BB named it KEYone instead of Mercury. Venice also looks promising at first but becomes flop latter. Nate650 The name is the least of their problems. The performance issues and price are more important. Muzaffar That's why it becomes a flop. paul4tA I skimmed most of the review and went straight to the performance, because if they haven't fixed that from the PRIV, nothing else matters. I love my physical keyboard and have actually come to appreciate some of the other features over time, but I don't think I can take another year of the terrible performance, waiting sometimes minutes for the software to catch up with me. Nate650 It's interesting that not all the reviews mentioned poor performance. That leads me to believe there is a particular culprit and that it's fixable. Jordan L 2 things: I need this on Verizon for one of my bosses, and where can I buy it? Jordan Palmer Updated the buy link. It's up in the specs. BB will be releasing a CDMA version sometime near the end of the month, I think. John Just hold off for 10 years or so until Blackberry's keyboard patents expire and we'll see it put to use by more competent manufacturers. HumbleButBlunt BB doesn't manufacture devices anymore. Cuvis They still hold the patents, and license them to TCL. ToniCipriani ‚úìp«ù·¥â…ü·¥â…π«ù å Probably earlier, when someone somewhere somehow leaks it China and other knockoff makers start building them. RickMLA Battery pull. Fixes everything. Francois Nguyen Battery is non-removable on the KEYone... ToniCipriani ‚úìp«ù·¥â…ü·¥â…π«ù å Hold the power button for 32 seconds = Battery Pull Reset. JL It¬¥s incredibly horrible! Dragos Lucian So Blackberry is starting to be like an ass itch, and I bet the majority doesn't like that feel. And while we're at it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rla7wt8wKGM djinn123 Just because you don't like PKB's it doesn't mean they aren't for someone else. I'm tired of hearing "who uses PKBs these days" or to that effect. If you can't understand why some people NEED it, then maybe you can just stfu? Stefan Seidel Is the keyboard touch sensitive like on the Priv? That's by far the most favourite feature on my Priv, and I'm sad everytime it doesn't work in an app. Also, as to add something useful to the physical versus virtual keyboard discussion: - multi-lingual virtual keyboards have only come up recently. I frequently write in different languages, and having to manually switch between them just doesn't work (especially when sometimes you insert a word from another language in the middle of a sentence) - I am a Sysadmin and every so often I do need to get in to some server from my phone. Doing that with a on-screen keyboard is nothing short of having a hot iron stamp on your forehead. Having the full screen AND quick and easy access to non-alphanumeric characters is such a huge plus that it would justify any price (if you need it for work/serious business). I agree that using Swype or Gboard with swiping is pretty darn good when it comes down to just blurting out some natural language. Anything beyond that is a pain. Hamilton Jimenez Vasquez I think physical keyboards are way better than touchscreen keyboards, but.... I wouldnt switch my large 5.7 and beautiful screen just to have a nicer keyboard, not in this world. Not sir. dabug91 So annoyed that this phone even exists. Blackberry needs to do the world a favor and permanently exit the smartphone business. They should have closed shop more than 6 years ago. Nate650 And how would that benefit you?

Now that Android Wear¬†is becoming a more mature platform, mostly thanks to the long-awaited 2.0 update, we're starting to see more watches than ever hit the market. It was fairly easy to compare Android Wear watches in years past - only a handful of tech companies even bothered. But now, a vast amount of wearables are being released, with most of them by actual watch companies. So how do they all stack up? You may notice some missing information below, especially from Fossil. We tried multiple times to reach out to Fossil for information on its upcoming watches, but we didn't receive a response. At a glance We've compiled a massive table¬†comparing every watch.¬†You can also look at it on Google Docs.

It's definitely one of the most feature-packed watches on the market, supporting every feature the OS does. It works with¬†Wi-Fi, LTE, NFC, and GPS - and includes a heart rate sensor and a speaker. As far as specifications go, it has a Snapdragon Wear 2100 CPU, a 480x480 1.38" circular display, IP68 water resistance, and a 430mAh battery. Unfortunately, battery life isn't fantastic, especially if you need to use LTE often. Be sure to check out our full review for more details, and you can buy it now from various retailers for $349. LG Watch Style Just like the Watch Sport, this was developed by LG and Google as an Android Wear 2.0 launch device.¬†The Style is much thinner than the Sport, but at the cost of features and battery life. It lacks NFC, LTE, GPS, and a heart rate sensor. The battery capacity is just 240mAh, which should only get you through a day of use (if that). The Style has a Wear 2100 processor, a round 1.2" 360x360 display, and IP67 water resistance. You can find our full review here, and if you want to buy one for yourself, it will cost you $249. Casio Pro Trek WSD-F20 If you need a super rugged Android Wear device, the WSD-F20 may be for you. Casio announced the watch back in January, and it just recently went on sale for a whopping $500. For that price, you're getting a speaker, Wi-Fi and GPS connectivity, and a 1.32" 320x300 display. However,¬†the WSD-F20 is missing quite a few important features. It doesn't have a heart rate sensor, NFC, or LTE. Also, it is one of the few 2017 Android Wear watches with a flat tire display. New Balance RunIQ New Balance released its first Android Wear watch earlier this year, the RunIQ. As you might guess, the RunIQ is primarily designed for workouts. It's powered by an Intel Atom Z34XX processor and includes Wi-Fi and GPS connectivity, a 1.39" 400x400 circular display, a 410mAh battery, and 5ATM water resistance. Unfortunately, the RunIQ lacks NFC for Android Pay, as well as LTE connectivity and a speaker. It's currently priced at $299. Huawei Watch 2 Why, Huawei? You were the chosen one! After the original Huawei Watch ended up being one of the best Android Wear devices on the market, many were excited for a newer model. Unfortunately, what Huawei provided was subjectively worse than the original - you can find our full review here. If you're still interested, the Huawei Watch 2 has a 1.2" 390x390 circular display, a 420mAh battery, IP67 water resistance, and all the connectivity and sensors you could want (including LTE). It's currently on sale for around $299, depending on the retailer. Huawei Watch 2 Classic The 'Classic' variant of the Huawei Watch 2 is probably closer to what most people were hoping for. It has almost exactly the same specifications as the normal Watch 2 - a Wear 2100 CPU, 1.2" 390x390 display, 420mAh battery, IP67 water resistance. However, it lacks the Wear 2's LTE support. The Watch 2 Classic is also $70 more expensive than the normal model, and shares many of its faults - small screen, no digital crown, etc. It's currently priced at $369 at most retailers. TAG Heuer Connected Modular 45 The award for the longest smartwatch name goes to the TAG Heuer Connected Modular 45. This watch has¬†an Intel Atom Z34XX processor (the same one the Casio watch uses), 1.39" 400x400 circular display, 410mAh battery, and speaker. As far as connectivity and sensors, it has¬†Wi-Fi, GPS, and NFC for Android Pay. It does not have a heart rate sensor or LTE. The Connected Modular 45 also wins the award for most expensive smartwatch on this list - you'll be shelling out $1,650 for the privilege of owning one. Montblanc Summit Similar to the TAG Huer, the Montblanc Summit is another luxury smartwatch. It has a Snapdragon Wear 2100 CPU, 1.39" 400x400 circular display, heart rate sensor, 300mAh battery, and IP68 water resistance. Unfortunately, the Summit is a bit light on functionality. It doesn't have NFC, LTE, GPS, or a speaker. Whether¬†or not that matters is up to you, but I expect the $890 starting price will drive most normal people away. GUESS Connect (2017) GUESS has made hybrid smartwatches with dot-matrix displays in the past, but this year, the company¬†released a proper Android Wear watch. It's available in two sizes - a 41mm for women (left) and a 44mm for men (right). The GUESS Connect has¬†a Snapdragon Wear 2100 processor but lacks NFC, LTE, GPS, and a heart rate sensor. The watch is expected to be released in Fall or Winter 2017 and will start at $300. Michael Kors Access¬†Grayson/Sofie Michael Kors announced two very similar Android Wear watches earlier this year, the Access Grayson (left) and Access Sofie (right). The Grayson looks more like a traditional men's watch, with an AMOLED display and a digital crown. It will be available in gold, stainless steel, and blue/black. The Sofie is primarily targeted at women, with a thinner case and a lighter feel than the Grayson. It has the same AMOLED display, but sadly¬†lacks a digital crown. It will have eight plating/bracelet combinations and seven interchangeable strap options. Both watches have a Snapdragon Wear 2100 processor and will start at $350. Misfit Vapor There are plenty of expensive products¬†on this list, but if you're looking for a good value smartwatch, the Misfit Vapor might be the best choice. It's¬†the second-cheapest Android Wear device on this list, at just $199, but it has¬†a Wear 2100 processor, a 1.39" circular display, water resistance up to 50 meters, Wi-Fi, GPS, and a heart rate sensor. However, I was unable to find confirmation that the Vapor included a speaker. Design-wise, the Misfit Vapor is definitely one of my favorites. It has a similar design to the Moto 360, but with a small bezel surrounding the screen instead of the 360's flat tire. It will launch in "Late Summer 2017." Diesel On Diesel's first Android Wear watch, the Diesel On, was announced earlier this year at Baselworld 2017. Hardly any useful information about it has been revealed, besides the fact that it uses a Snapdragon Wear 2100 processor and will have "hundreds of customization options." It looks like it has a digital crown, but we can't be sure. The watch will be available in "Holiday 2017," and will start at $350. Fossil Q Venture/Q Explorist Fossil's first Android Wear watch was released back in 2015, and the company followed up on it with two more in 2016. This year, Fossil is releasing the Q Venture and Q Explorist. Details on these are also incredibly sparse, but we do know both watches will have a Snapdragon Wear 2100 CPU and will be released in the Fall. It seems very likely that both watches have a flat tire display, as companies often try to use black watch faces in promotional material (such as the above image) to hide it. In fact, adjusting the brightness and contrast on the above image does reveal a flat tire. Movado Connect Movado's first Android Wear device, the Movado Connect, definitely looks sleek. It has an edge-to-edge 1.46" 400x400 circular display, a 300mAh battery, Wi-Fi connectivity, and NFC for Android Pay. However, it is worth noting that the Connect lacks a speaker, LTE, GPS, and a heart rate sensor. The watch will be available in Fall 2017, starting at $495. Hugo Boss Touch Another sleek Android Wear watch announced this year is the Hugo Boss Touch, priced at $395.¬†The specifications are identical to the Movado Connect - Wear 2100 CPU, 300mAh battery, 1.46" 400x400 circular display, and Wi-Fi/NFC connectivity. Just like the Connect, it's missing a speaker, LTE, GPS, and a heart rate sensor. You'll be able to buy it this Fall. Tommy Hilfiger TH24/7You This watch wins the award for the worst smartwatch name, but it seems to be pretty good at everything else. It has a Wear 2100 processor, a 1.4" circular 400x400 display, and a 300mAh battery. The watch does have Wi-Fi and NFC support, but lacks a speaker, LTE, GPS, and a heart rate sensor. You'll be able to buy the TH24/7You in the Fall for $299 - making it one of the more competitively-priced options on this list. ZTE Quartz At $192, the ZTE Quartz is¬†the least expensive watch on this list, barely beating out the Misfit Vapor. Currently exclusive to T-Mobile, the Quartz has a Wear 2100 CPU, 1.4" 400x400 circular display, and IP67 water resistance. It supports Wi-Fi, 3G, and GPS connectivity, but no NFC. There's also no heart rate sensor on the Quartz, but it does have the largest battery of any watch on this list at 500mAh. The carrier exclusivity is a bit of a bummer, but maybe we'll see an unlocked model show up in the future. Verizon Wear24 Verizon surprised everyone when it announced an LTE-capable Android Wear watch alongside the LG Watch Sport, undercutting the latter device in the process. The Wear24 has all the features of the Watch Sport, except GPS and a heart rate sensor (and possibly a speaker, Verizon hasn't confirmed that). When the Wear24 goes on sale, you'll be able to buy it for $349 outright or $300 on a two-year contract. It also remains to be seen how bulky the watch will be - that was definitely a problem for the Watch Sport, and Verizon hasn't released any photos. Conclusion We're starting to see more and more actual watch companies invest in Android Wear, which I see as a good thing for the platform.¬†Up until now, Android Wear has largely only been used by tech enthusiasts. I've seen plenty of people with Apple Watches (not as many as Apple would like, but still), but hardly anyone with Android Wear devices. Android Wear 2.0 in general is a bit of a mixed bag. While I personally don't mind the changes as much, others are much less happy about it, and for valid reasons. We'll have to see where the platform goes in the coming months (and years), but there is no shortage of watches to choose from.

Such a shame. Corbin Davenport That one was released in 2016. Dimitris Kanellopoulos Right. Sorry Raven ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà It might also have been released late 2016, but it is a shame that you did not include the Asus ZenWatch 3 in this comparison. I think it is one of the best Wear 2100 based smart watches currently available and at only $209 it is a steal compared to some of the ones listed here. I am loving mine. Tucker Sferro scrolling down the list, I am amazed at the prices. I loved my Moto 360 1st gen, I paid $100 for it on Craigslist. That's exactly what it's worth. You know why? The battery died after about 18 months and it's now a brick. The general public doesnt want to pay more than $150 for a secondary "cell phone-like" piece of hardware that only lasts 2 years, period. Smartwatches will NEVER take off until the cost point drops dramatically. This is the same thing that e-readers went through, until Amazon stepped up to the plate and brought the costs dow. Thomas Paulsen A fellow Moto 360 1st gen user here with a dead battery. I paid top dollar and it burned me so much that I am holding back from another purchase. The only reasons that I would reconsider are being able to open smart locks with NFC, robust assistant voice control ("open garage door"), broader Android Pay availability and - of course - a moderate price because we all know gadgets become obsolete fast. Tucker Sferro I found an article online that shows you how to replace the battery ($15), but it involved cracking the plastic off the back of the 360, etc. I would also be unhappy if I paid full price. Thomas Paulsen This video was posted two months ago and details the battery swap: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1as_h5jnBM Lazyboy0172 Oh I am going to be very sad when my battery dies. I've had my 360 since september 2014 and have no battery problems so far, but I'll be very sad to lose it. That's really the only thing that will get me to replace it though, because right now the thought of spending $300+ on something newer with the only real difference being that it looks better does not make sense to me. And I think that's the problem with the market right now- the price points just aren't there between manufacturers and consumers. Consumers do not want to supplement their $500 phone with a $400 watch, and then have to replace that watch every couple years. But no manufacturer can afford to sell a nice looking watch at <$150 and then also not have any repeat customers for 3+ years. Tucker Sferro you bring up a good point, that manufacturers are unable to bring the costs down to a more attractive level, which is why someone like Amazon (shudders) might be able to lower the cost with a Fire watch, or something like that. Oh boy, ads on my watch?! I just threw up on myself. brkshr Replacing the battery costs about $10 and 20 minutes. Kyle R Krcmaric I just want to have Android Wear at or below $150 on a device that supports Android Pay. GreatNews You forgot to include the all new ZTE Quartz https://www.t-mobile.com/internet-device/zte-quartz Corbin Davenport You're right, I'll be adding it shortly. Rorison Meadows II I need a camera on a decent sized one for video calling and photos. Come on people! marcusmarcus2 Here you go :) http://www.doki.com/ Daniel Nava Best Buy has the LG Watch Style for $170 right now. I picked one up and could not be happier with it. I just wanted a nice looking basic Android Wear watch under $200 and I got it. Matt It's a shame that Wear 2.0 is so bad. Roy ?WHY kamiller42 Oh. Where do I begin? 1. The watch is no longer an extension of the phone. This hurts the convenience of using the watch. 2. Apps that used to work no longer. Most times, permissions have to be granted again. Other times, the watch app has lost connectivity with the phone. 3. Notifications which used to appear don't. 4. It's slower than previous versions. 5. Theater mode in 1 click, 1 swipe, and 2 taps vs 2 clicks. 6. DnD no longer works. Why? Because Google wants the watch to act as an independent device. DnD on watch and phone are not connected. A handful of people say that's great, but the situations they bring up are edge cases. Most people, when they say "Do not disturb me" means do not disturb me at all. 7. I have not figured out to answer the phone from the watch. The only option I see is to refuse call. Used to be simple. Swipe right to answer. Swipe left to refuse. Roy 1. It's great. Only need good sync. 2. Wich apps? 3. Why not? All the reviews says it's work. 4. Mmm for sure now they need to upgrade the hardware for independent os. 5. What's for? 6. You right about that. 7. I didn't hear about that. So if I can Make a summary no everything work flawless so it's good that I didn't buy one just yet but it doesn't mean that Android Wear 2.0 not in good Direction. I hated the first version. Matt Why is that a shame or why is it bad? Michael Maggard ZTE Quartz came out in 2017, has Android Wear 2.0, and is under US$200. https://www.t-mobile.com/internet-device/zte-quartz Corbin Davenport Yep, I'll be adding it to the post shortly. Derik Taylor Also, the ZTE Quartz does have GPS. In the description, you said it doesn't. :| (I have it, which is the only reason I knew that.) marcusmarcus2 The discription also says it has NFC but I cannot see that it does on the T mobile website or the ZTE website. Derik Taylor Huh...didn't notice that. No NFC. :( Not that I planned on using it anyway, but still would have been nice as an option. abqnm I see it's on there now. There's a bit of an error though. In the blurb for it, it says there IS NFC but NO GPS. It's the other way around. It HAS GPS and NO NFC. The entry in the table is correct though. Thanks for this post. It's a great way to compare at a glance. Corbin Davenport Yep, some info got mixed when I was adding the Quartz and Wear24 at the same time. Both the table and the article text should be correct now. abqnm Thanks, but it's not quite correct still. The Quartz description now says but no GPS, LTE, or NFC It does have GPS, but not LTE or NFC. marcusmarcus2 Third time's a charm http://s2.quickmeme.com/img/1a/1ab37c4fc16eae0cf8505ad03c1652fea7659118ab91a6fa386c4e1e514266aa.jpg Corbin Davenport I clearly can't write today. Fixed! abqnm Haha no worries. We've all been there. marcusmarcus2 https://www.zteusa.com/zte-quartz "500 mAh" Dang, it has the largest battery compared to those listed and it still only has "up to 36 hours of battery life per charge" Kyle Gospodnetich Are you guys ever going to talk about the joke that is the Android Wear 2.0 OTAs? Most watches don't even have it yet, and Google completely backed down on their 'fast update, all at once' promise. Dan W agreed. i was hoping that AP would hold Google's feet to the fire on the 2.0 updates. they've been a tragic reminder of how little Google and its partners care about timely updates. Captain On! It's hard to forget, but updates aren't solely on Google. Manufacturers and driver support can hold software updates back regardless of Google trying to shove it out the door. EcE But since there was such promise, shouldn't have Google "certified" the watches somehow? Ensuring that the updates can be pushed timely? kamiller42 Google is doing you a favor. AW 2.0 is a work in progress. Its flow is not as fast and fluid as previous. me me Agreed, I tried the Developer Preview, Watch become unusable. Ambition >> specifications. Carson Saldanha When did they say "fast update, all at once" Mayoo Honorable mention to one of the longest tags section I've seen on AP https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4be9fae6b2e3863638bc20bd2881a3021302f2677608ddc958771313cae23baf.png PJ Anderson The LG Watch Style has a speaker? David Ruddock It doesn't, the table has been corrected. IcerC The Verizon Wear24 comes out in less than a week right? Add that one. tu3218 Has Verizon even announced a date yet? Still nothing on their website. Rashad May 11 tu3218 Where did you see that? Rashad I added the link afterwards. tu3218 Good deal. Although I'm really still waiting for the gear S3. But we all know how that's going for Verizon. Corbin Davenport Yeah, I'll add that one as well. YaKillaCJ The messed up part is the Misfit Vapor is the clear winner in terms of aesthetics and specs when not factoring price. Yet it's priced ridiculously competitive. I think I will get it to upgrade my Moto 360 1st Gen. victor sanchez same here. jawsnnn It will probably have some glaring flaw when it comes out. That has been the pattern for Android Wear devices so far: Announcement,Excitement,Dashed hopes and dreams. 005 anyone know if Misfit vapor has speaker if that has speaker that seals the deal all the way i can leave with out NFC for that price its hands down the best if only had spaker Corbin Davenport I found no mention of a speaker anywhere. 005 thanks hope they do because Huawei Watch 2 Classic went way down in design not sure what the heck happen ObligatoryEscapments It has 5ATM water resistance. In the Android Wear world, that means no speaker. (See: Casio, Nixon, Polar. All speakerless) i_say_uuhhh That Movado looks amazing, just wish it had a speaker and LTE. skillfulshoe Don't be fooled by that picture, it doesn't have an edge to edge screen. Not sure how AP missed that. https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/3/24/15052504/movado-android-wear-watch-connect-baselworld-2017 Roy THE CPU IS CRAP. marcusmarcus2 Really? I thought it was silicon. Roy Really why 28nm?! Stevie_Wonder The Misfit will probably be my first smartwatch. Might have some shortcomings, for example the lacking of NFC, but I don't think I will really need that since Android Pay isn't even launched here. Not sure if a speaker is really useful. And a question for the smartwatch users. My provider doesn't support a second sim so can't use the LTE option, but how useful is it and do you use it a lot? Will it connect through Bluetooth with your phone first and if that fails use LTE to connect? ObligatoryEscapments Casio is even stingier than Fossil with specs, but it's very surprising to hear that they've abandoned their custom SoC from the WSD-10 to use the Qualcomm. Also, I think it's a safe assumption the Verizon/Quanta Wear24 has a speaker. It's an LTE watch that makes phone calls. haberd I would love to see dimensions added. My major problem with this crop is they are too bulky for constant wear bƒÅbƒÅ ghan≈´j Full spec sheet for all Android Wear watches here! https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lbKhNnFBARrT5TVo3bkyp1UzT0S5Iahy3W9dAQf_sfc/edit#gid=0 ethd "The award for the longest smartwatch name goes to the TAG Heuer Connected Modular 45. This watch has an Intel Atom Z34XX processor (the same one the Casio watch uses), 1.39" 400x400 circular display, 410mAh battery, and speaker." I think you meant that it has the same processor the New Balance one uses. Your table and the article both say that the Casio Pro Trek uses a SDW2100. JD Seeing how Google Treats Android Wear. That's a big list of Casualties to add to the already long list of casualties. FlyOnTheWall No Polar M600? Corbin Davenport That was released last year. Akshdeep For ZTE Quartz in the table you have mentioned screen size as 1.4 and 400x400 but below you have written 1.3 and 480x480. Please make correction. Corbin Davenport Thanks, it has been fixed. Carson Saldanha The table says the LG Watch Style has a speaker, but I'm pretty sure it doesn't. Might wanna fix that ;) jmwils3 Haven't gotten any final news from Verizon, as the csms don't have the information, but the NFC chip on the wear24 don't seem to be active and no Android pay present, at least currently. Who knows if an update will activate them by official launch day, but the fact the original verizon article has been edited to remove references to NFC and the product page is gone isn't all that encouraging. Iagoba Apellaniz Compass? I want to see the ability to point to north Richard Markert I have both gens of 360, but I'm going to get a Gear S3 Classic for my next smartwatch. Not going to do another Wear watch. lcasale Can't even buy the LG Sport. It's been sold out on the Google Store and Verizon has pushed back the pre-ordered twice now (by two months). I'm expecting them to miss the latest 5/11 ship date as well. b_boogey_xl I think I'll go with the Huawei Watch 2 Classic. The only knock I have with it is, no LTE (not a deal breaker but‚Ä¶) and I wish they left off those notches that do nothing for a digital watch üôÑ. Don't really care for a digital crown since it doesn't have a greater function like it does on the Apple Watch, it just sounds like a "me too" feature. Now just to wait for the price to drop since everyone hates it‚Ä¶ üòä. peterfares You sure the Wear24 doesn't have GPS? I think it does. OrangeSweater Are you sure the Misfit Vapor has LTE? The only thing I see listed on the product page is Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity. It seems odd that it would include LTE when it is so much cheaper than what is available from other companies.

Google bakes phishing protection into the Gmail for Android app Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/03 7:40pm PDTMay 3, 2017 52 Plus 1 on G+ 111 Share on Facebook 86 Share on Twitter Total Shares249 Applications Google News Perhaps due to today's outbreak of a widespread phishing scam, or simply by coincidence, Google is rolling out enhanced anti-phishing security checks in Gmail for Android. When users tap on a suspicious link, the above warning will now appear. Judging by the page design, this feature appears to use Google's Safe Browsing database, which¬†catalogs sites known to host malware or trick users into giving away information. Ironically, this wouldn't have done anything to prevent the recent phishing outbreak, as the link in that email redirected to a normal Google login page. The change appears to be part of Gmail for Android 7.4.23, which you can grab from APKMirror right now, or wait for the Play Store to roll out the update to you.

Since the same emails are present in both Gmail and Inbox there's nothing stopping users from switching between either service, or using both, so it's not comparable to Hangouts and Allo where the services are not compatible. Grey I disagree completely. You could easily merge the two and include both workflows. This is stupid. It's 2017, we're capable of having an optional Zero Inbox Gmail. One app. Not two. JG Or Allo, Hangouts, et al... Today it was sent via email, but that doesn't always have to be the case. makeitra1n That's why i switched back to Gmail after 2 years... Inbox is so outdated! You can't even PRINT!!!! And this after years since release of the app. Gonzales I can print from inbox A Person I don't get why people use Inbox. It's like Gmail but with less features. Fargo_Zoidberg Snoozing emails is a godsend. Tickets for events months from now, for example. Have 'em pop back up in your inbox a day before an event. Concerts, hotel reservations, flight tickets, etc. navjot That's the main reason I use it. Maybe with the new notification features with O, I can do something similar with the Gmail app. Eric Witts Totally agree. If you get any of the extras (package tracking, tickets, boarding passes, etc.) Inbox is the best Gonzales I like saving web pages to inbox for reading later. I also love deleting a ton of emails with one click xyz Nah, if I get tickets I would just download them to my PC/phone the moment I got it. I wouldn't rely on having access to email right before the scheduled date. Fargo_Zoidberg Yeah I get you, that's why I never use a calendar either. All events in my future are stored in a document on my computer. That way I don't have to rely on having access to Google Calendar, Keep, etc. right before the scheduled event. Corbin Davenport Inbox is fantastic for mail management though. I especially love being able to pin items, like shipping statuses and GitHub issues I need to work on. Gonzales Exactly! Google once stated that Inbox was the future of Gmail. Well they've taken their sweet time adding features to it.

REUTERS/San Bernardino County Sheriffs Department/Handout/File Photo LOS ANGELES - Family members of three victims of the December 2015 shooting rampage in San Bernardino, California, have sued Facebook, Google and Twitter, claiming that the companies permitted Islamic State to flourish on social media. The relatives assert that by allowing Islamic State militants to spread propaganda freely on social media, the three companies provided "material support" to the group and enabled attacks such as the one in San Bernardino. "For years defendants have knowingly and recklessly provided the terrorist group ISIS with accounts to use its social networks as a tool for spreading extremist propaganda, raising funds and attracting new recruits," family members of Sierra Clayborn, Tin Nguyen and Nicholas Thalasinos charge in the 32-page complaint, which was filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles on Wednesday. "Without defendants Twitter, Facebook and Google (YouTube), the explosive growth of ISIS over the last few years into the most feared terrorist group in the world would not have been possible," the complaint said. Spokeswomen for Twitter and Google declined to comment on the lawsuit. Representatives for Facebook could not immediately be reached by Reuters on Thursday afternoon. Syed Rizwan Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, opened fire on a holiday gathering of Farook's co-workers at a government building in San Bernardino on Dec. 2, 2015, killing 14 people and wounding 22 others. Farook, the 28-year-old, U.S.-born son of Pakistani immigrants, and Malik, 29, a Pakistani native, died in a shootout with police four hours after the massacre. Authorities have said the couple was inspired by Islamist militants. At the time, the assault ranked as the deadliest attack by Islamist extremists on U.S. soil since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. In June 2016, an American-born gunman pledging allegiance to the leader of Islamic State shot 49 people to death at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida, before he was killed by police. In December 2016 the families of three men killed at the nightclub sued Twitter, Google and Facebook in federal court on allegations similar to those in the California lawsuit. Federal law gives internet companies broad immunity from liability for content posted by their users. A number of lawsuits have been filed in recent years seeking to hold social media companies responsible for terror attacks, but none has advanced beyond the preliminary phases.

Home FEATURED Cellphones Notebooks Gaming Tablets Software Raspberry Pi Can Now be Controlled via Voice, Thanks to Google May 5, 2017, By Sanjeev Ramachandran Share This Related Posts Meet Jelly, the World‚Äôs Smallest Smartphone Facelifted Tizen OS to Debut with Samsung Galaxy Z4 Raspberry has come miles off its initial form of being just an educational stick for enlightening kids and adults with comping knowledge. It‚Äôs now the base of all the DIY projects ranging from gaming emulators to those dealing with IoT. Picking this up, tech giant Google has decided to give a leg up to the micro computing sticks by handing it the prowess of voice recognition. In tie-up with the Raspberry Pi Foundation, Google has rolled out new Voice Kit that will transform the devices with a new voice-controlled interface instead of the physical keyboard and touch-screens. The prime aim is to give a push to Raspberry Pi in the field of AI experiments. For that matter, Google is also opening up access to its Assistant and Cloud services including Android Things for RPi with its new kit. The kit will include the entire hardware required for voice recognition including those to capture the audio and output hardware for audio playback. This will add the new Hardware Accessory on Top atop Raspberry Pi that will include speakers and connectors. Being a DIY kit, Google has also made it certain that it comes out made of cardboard, much similar to the Cardboard VR. The kit is currently being made available at Barnes & Noble Stores. It will also be available free for those who purchase the physical cop of MagPi magazine this month. The Voice Kit comes as a part of Google‚Äôs new endeavor called the AIY Project that aims to cater DIY projects with an emphasis on AI developments.

Transparency International EU¬†(TI)¬†says that major Silicon Valley companies have been lobbying in¬†Brussels for¬†years, but¬†that the budget for¬†lobbying has been increased in¬†recent years, as¬†Brussels tries to¬†tackle tax avoidance schemes, data protection and privacy issues. The √úber-Lobbyists: how Silicon Valley is changing Brussels #lobbying https://t.co/ap4Ncgtq8p ‚Äî¬†Transparency Int. EU (@TI_EU) 4 May 2017 ‚ÄãGoogle and Facebook are the two companies spending the most on¬†lobbying in¬†2017, according to¬†TI, at¬†US$4.66 million and US$1.1 million respectively. Google lobby spend is up¬†240 percent since¬†2014. Cisco, Qualcomm, Apple, Oracle, Symantec, Netflix, Uber and eBay are all among¬†the top spenders on¬†lobbying. ¬© REUTERS/ Yves Herman Campaigners Slam Another 'Revolving Door' Ex-EU Chief Appointment in Lobby Row "One of¬†the secrets of¬†Google's lobbying strategy seems to¬†be the hiring staff from¬†the EU institutions. Our research has shown that four out¬†of seven lobbyists currently accredited with¬†the European Parliament have been hired directly from¬†the Parliament to¬†lobby their former colleagues," said Raphael Kergueno, TI Policy Officer, EU Integrity in¬†a blog. "A total of¬†23 individuals from¬†the EU institutions have been hired since¬†2009, of¬†which 11 were specifically lobbying the EU. With the more than¬†one meeting per week, the strategy is paying off, potentially setting the example for¬†other Silicon Valley companies."¬† According to¬†TI, Uber¬†‚Äî the app-driven transport outfit, which made headlines in¬†May 2016 by¬†hiring former Commissioner Neelie Kroes¬†‚Äî as¬†increased its lobby spending seven fold since¬†2015, although from¬†a low base. "All accredited lobbyists working for¬†the car-booking service have previous experience from¬†inside the EU institutions. Two of¬†them were actually hired from¬†Google's Brussels operation. With 50 high-levels meetings, the company already ranks 4th among¬†our list of¬†25 major Silicon Valley companies," TI said. Commission Cases The European Commission has accused Google of¬†abusing its dominant position by¬†systematically favoring its comparison shopping service in¬†its search result pages and also by¬†artificially restricting the possibility of¬†third party websites to¬†display search advertisements from¬†Google's competitors. ¬© Photo: Pixabay EU Launches Another Probe Into Google, Struggles to Slay US Tech Giant The Commission has sent a Statement of¬†Objections to¬†Facebook alleging the company provided incorrect or misleading information during¬†the Commission's 2014 investigation under¬†the EU Merger Regulation of¬†Facebook's planned acquisition of¬†WhatsApp. The Commission is in¬†legal dispute after¬†concluding that Ireland granted undue tax benefits of¬†up to¬†US$14.25 billion to¬†Apple. This, says the Commission, is illegal under¬†EU state aid rules, because it allowed Apple to¬†pay substantially less tax than¬†other businesses. Ireland must now recover the illegal aid. The European Court of¬†Justice is considering a case referred from¬†a Spanish court against¬†Uber, seeking to¬†define whether the company is a transport firm or an app service provider¬†‚Äî an "enabling platform."

"Thank you for your interest in the Android Beta Program! The beta for Android Nougat has concluded, and all devices that were opted in have been updated to the current public version,"¬†read the company's post on its Android Beta Program¬†webpage. "If you are still running a beta version of Nougat you may¬†download¬†the latest full OTA image for your device and sideload it.¬†This will not wipe your device. We'll update this site when the Android O Beta Program begins." Read: Android O Features: How To Download Google‚Äôs Developer Preview Software The company is expected to launch the Android O Beta program this month. The shutdown of the Android Nougat Beta Program is significant¬†since it marks the fact that Google has ceded its final version of Android Nougat to users and no more major software updates associated with the operating system will be available anymore. Instead, users will need to wait for the next Android OS update ‚Äî Android O, if their device is eligible for it.¬†The company posted a video in March detailing Android O features on YouTube. The video contained revelations on several new features of the new operating system: Providing users ability to limit location data availability: In the current Android Nougat-based setup, an app can track your data indefinitely once it is granted the permission the first time. In Android O, apps will be able to track user data for a few hours at the maximum. Autofill APIs: Android O will come with new autofill features, which will let you enter the username and password into apps more easily. Picture-in-picture mode: This will let users multi-task better by minimizing tabs even when they are active.¬†For example, if you have minimized a tab playing a YouTube video, the video will still be playing at the bottom of your screen. Multi-display support: The new update will let users work on a device, even while it is mirrored to another one. Prioritized Notifications: Notifications will now be available in order of priority, instead of being available in order of occurence. Read: Android O: 5 New Features Revealed In Android Developers 'What's New' Video Google is expected to launch the second Android O Developer Preview at Google I/O, which takes place May 17-19.¬† The company is expected to launch at least two beta versions of the software before September, followed by the official OS update in October, alongside the Google Pixel 2. Currently, what the ‚ÄòO‚Äô stands for is not known. But based on Google's precedence of naming¬†Android updates after desserts, the next Android update may well be called the Android Oreo.¬†¬† Related Stories Google Maps Update Lets Users Edit, Add Roads Google Adds Anti-Phishing Feature To Gmail Android App Join the Discussion Most Read Stay connected to the biggest stories unfolding in technology.

Google beefs up security in Android Gmail app following Docs phishing scam Trump administration is giving us a good lesson on Twitter security Video Why You Lost Your Windows 10 Product Key Google has stopped Wednesday‚Äôs clever email phishing scheme, but the attack may very well make a comeback. One security researcher has already managed to replicate it, even as Google is trying to protect users from such attacks. ‚ÄúIt looks exactly like the original spoof,‚Äù said Matt Austin, director of security research at Contrast Security. [ Further reading: How the new age of antivirus software will protect your PC ] The phishing scheme‚Äîwhich may have circulated to 1 million Gmail users‚Äîis particularly effective because it fooled users with a dummy app that looked like Google Docs. Recipients who received the email were invited to click a blue box that said ‚ÄúOpen in Docs.‚Äù Those who did were brought to an actual Google account page that asks them to handover Gmail access to the dummy app. While fooling users with spoofed emails is nothing new, Wednesday‚Äôs attack involved an actual third-party app made with real Google processes. The company‚Äôs developer platform can enable anyone to create web-based apps. In this case, the culprit chose to name the app ‚ÄúGoogle Docs‚Äù in an effort to trick users. The search company has shut down the attack by removing the app. It‚Äôs also barred other developers from using ‚ÄúGoogle‚Äù in naming their third-party apps. However, Austin found he could still reproduce Wednesday‚Äôs phishing scheme. He did so, by using the search company‚Äôs developer platform to create his own third-party app, and also called it ‚ÄúGoogle Docs.‚Äù Michael Kan Security researcher Matt Austin replicated Wednesday‚Äôs phishing attack using Cyrillic script.¬† The only difference is that Austin used a Cyrillic character, used in Russia, for the letter ‚Äúo‚Äù in his app‚Äôs name. ‚ÄúThe Cyrillic letter o looks exactly like the other letter o,‚Äù Austin said. He then replicated the rest of the Wednesday‚Äôs attack, creating a fake email that uses the same design interface. ¬† Austin has submitted the security issue to Google, and now its developer platform no longer accepts apps under that name. However, he and other security experts predict that bad actors are also working on replicating Wednesday‚Äôs attack. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no question that this will be repeated again,‚Äù said Ayse Kaya, a director at Cisco Cloudlock Cyberlabs, a security provider. ‚ÄúIt will probably happen much more often.‚Äù More traditional phishing email schemes can strike by tricking users into giving up their login credentials. However, Wednesday‚Äôs attack takes a different approach and abuses what‚Äôs known as the OAuth protocol, a convenient way for internet accounts to link with third-party applications. Through OAuth, users don‚Äôt have to hand over any password information. They instead grant permission so that one third-party app can connect to their internet account, at say, Google, Facebook or Twitter. But like any technology, OAuth can be exploited. Back in 2011, one developer even warned that the protocol could be used in a phishing attack with apps that impersonate Google services. Nevertheless, OAuth has become a popular standard used across IT. CloudLock has found that over 276,000 apps use the protocol through services like Google, Facebook and Microsoft Office 365. What aided Wednesday‚Äôs phishing scheme was that Google‚Äôs own services didn‚Äôt do enough to point out it came from a suspicious developer, said Aaron Parecki, an IT consultant who helps businesses implement OAuth. For instance, the dummy Google Docs app was registered to a developer at eugene.pupov@gmail.com‚Äîa red flag that the product wasn‚Äôt real. However, the dummy app still managed to fool users because Google‚Äôs own account permission page never plainly listed the developer‚Äôs information, unless the user clicks the page to find out, Parecki said. Cloudlock The developer behind the fake Google Docs app only appears if you mouse over the product informaiton.¬† ‚ÄúI was surprised Google didn‚Äôt show much identifying information with these apps,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a great example of what can go wrong.‚Äù Rather than hide those details, all of it should be shown to users, Parecki said. ¬† Austin agreed, and said apps that ask for permission to Gmail should include a more blatant warning over what the user is handing over. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not on the OAuth hate bandwagon yet. I do see it as valuable,‚Äù Austin said. ‚ÄúBut there are some risks with it.‚Äù Fortunately, Google was able to quickly foil Wednesday‚Äôs attack, and is introducing ‚Äúanti-abuse systems‚Äù to prevent it from happening again. Users who might have been affected can do a Google security checkup to review what apps are connected to their accounts. The company‚Äôs Gmail Android app is also introducing a new security feature to warn users about possible phishing attempts. ¬† It‚Äôs tempting to install apps and assume they‚Äôre safe. But users and businesses need to be careful when linking accounts to third-party apps, which might be asking for more access than they need, Cloudlock‚Äôs Kaya said.¬† ‚ÄúHackers have a headstart exploiting this attack,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúAll companies need to be thinking about this.‚Äù To comment on this article and other PCWorld content, visit our Facebook page or our Twitter feed.

The letter was seen by the FT and among the allegations made was that big internet platforms abuse their privileged position. Not specific companies were named but since there was apparently specific reference to mobile operating systems, app stores and search engines, that basically means Google and Apple. Since Google accounts for around 85% of the global smartphone market via Android, an even greater share of internet search and the majority of global browser share, it would be fair to assume that company is the main focus of such ire. Apple, however, keeps even tighter control of its mobile platform than Google does. The letter was signed by the CEOs of Spotify and Deezer, so the specific area of concern is presumably music streaming services. Both Google and Apple have their own competing music streaming services, which they would presumably like to see steal market share from the incumbents. Google even managed to persuade Samsung recently to support the Google service over its own. One of the specific request in the letter is for extra regulation to cover this sort of thing since antitrust litigation is very expensive and time-consuming. Google is regularly under the spotlight for this sort of thing, with search company Yandex recently having some success in Turkey and Russia. Meanwhile Spotify has moaned specifically about Apple hampering its efforts. The FT didn‚Äôt get any comment from Google or Apple on the story but letters like this are bound to cause concern as they‚Äôre just the sort of thing that gets the European Commission juggernaut rolling, which usually results in at least extensive fines.

More work 28 Apr 2017 Banking & Finance Banks must boost cybersecurity 21 Apr 2017 Companies ‚ÄòSafety climate‚Äô is key to avoiding marine accidents 21 Apr 2017 Microsoft this week declared its intention to take back a market segment long lost to Google: the education sector. At a New York launch event on Tuesday, Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella unveiled Windows 10s, which is aimed at the high school market. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not like education is new to us. We‚Äôve been there,‚Äù Nadella said. The challenge for Microsoft, of course, is that Google has the habit of offering everything free. Its Chromebook series, for instance, many made by third-party manufacturers, including Acer, ASUS, Dell, and HP, sell for as low as US$200. Adding to the challenge is the free Chrome OS, which runs the same Android apps people already use ‚Äì Google Docs, Sheets and Slides ‚Äì at no additional cost. So, even though the beautifully designed Surface Laptop from Microsoft will cost US$999, the company is ready to price its low-end models starting at US$189. A question thus arises: Why would companies fight so hard over the education market, a segment that is relatively small and not very profitable? Among business school academics, the so-called network effect is a favoured explanation for the rise of Uber, Airbnb, eBay and Facebook. In each of these cases, the company took on the role of a platform (another favoured term), facilitating sellers on the supply side and buyers on the demand side in their efforts to exchange goods or services. The value of a platform depends largely on the number of users on each side of the exchange. There should come a time when Microsoft alerts you to head home and orders an Uber on your behalf so that you get enough sleep for an important business meeting the next day, all without any human intervention from your Outlook Calendar Consider for a moment any dating website, from OkCupid to Tinder to Match.com. Men are drawn toward them because there is a huge supply of women on the other side, and vice versa. Because of this network effect, successful platforms often enjoy an increasing return to scale. Users are willing to pay more for access to a bigger network, and so profit margins improve as user bases grow. With little to differentiate products fundamentally ‚Äì think Uber against Lyft or iMessage against WhatsApp ‚Äì platform competition is often reduced to a game of ‚Äúgrow fast or die‚Äù. That is why when Snapchat went public last March: the number of daily active users became the single most important metric. The more users there are chatting on Snap, the more willing big brands like Coca-Cola or P&G are to buy ads there. The logic of the network effect, however, does not apply only to social media apps, but also to technological creators like Microsoft. The reason that Google Chromebooks are becoming so popular among educators and students is not only because they are affordable but because the Android operating system provides users with hundreds of thousands of apps to choose from. The Chromebook is, in fact, a platform that links students on the demand side, and app developers on the supply side. The more end users there are, the more likely a third party is willing to devote time and energy to develop exciting apps. But size is not the only thing that matters; quality does too. Before Facebook, Myspace had been the reigning king of social networks. Founded in 2003, it commanded a loyal allegiance of bands, photographers, and other creative people. As late as 2006, it was the top social network in America. News Corp‚Äôs Rupert Murdoch bought the company for $580 million, believing that Myspace could be worth as much as $6 billion. Myspace‚Äôs fall from grace was striking. By April 2008, the site was losing 40 million unique visitors per month. Some blamed its design, which resembled a massive spaghetti-ball mess; others attributed the failure to the lack of technological innovation. But the core problem was its reputation. The network was flooded with scantily clad would-be celebrities, filling the site with scandalising photos that led to the public perception of a digital ghetto. Elite users were fleeing en masse to the next safe haven: Facebook. Viewed in this light, it should come as no surprise that Facebook today is pouring everything it can into artificial intelligence (AI). ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about making sure that every moment you spend online you spend with the content you want to see, with the people you want to share,‚Äù explained Facebook chief technology officer Mike Schroepfer. To avoid getting dethroned, a platform player must constantly dial up the user experience. For Facebook, building AI is key. ‚ÄúFacebook‚Äôs progress in AI can be seen in everything from the company‚Äôs news feed to the way in which people are tagged,‚Äù Schroepfer added in another interview. It‚Äôs about making sure that every moment you spend online you spend with the content you want to see, with the people you want to share Mike Schroepfer, Facebook chief technology officer Again, the primacy of AI is all too obvious for Microsoft as well. Whether it is Google Assistant, Apple‚Äôs Siri, Amazon‚Äôs Alexa, or Microsoft‚Äôs Cortana, a company can improve its AI‚Äôs performance only as fast as it grows its user base. How far machine learning can progress depends on how much data a firm can capture. And the improvement that is brought forth by AI will in turn improve the customer experience, making users even more loyal. There should come a time when Microsoft alerts you to head home and orders an Uber on your behalf so that you get enough sleep for an important business meeting the next day, all without any human intervention from your Outlook Calendar. But to get there, data is everything. Specifically, a segment that represents the needs of future users and emerging trends would be undoubtedly most helpful. While the requirements among professional adults will always be high, the tolerance of product failures and the eagerness to embrace the next big things among teenagers and students are well documented. Cracking the education market will provide a direct roadmap for Microsoft to jump-start experimentation with the most leading edge consumer segment it will ever find. What this all means is that there is a life cycle for industries, where companies need to prioritise growth over profits. For IT players, the rise of AI has triggered such a paradigm shift. The education segment may not look very profitable, but the learning from it is invaluable. Does your company also need to prioritise growth over profits?

Several members of the Pixel¬†and Nexus¬†communities on Google's product forums have encountered the issue since installing the Android Nougat 7.1.2 OTA. The issue appears to be affecting both the Pixel and Pixel XL, as well as the LG-made¬†Nexus 5X and Huawei Nexus 6P. Reports suggest that while the Pixel and Nexus¬†Imprint sensors are no longer granting access to the devices, the swipe down for notifications Moves gesture is still functional. Attempts to solve the problem by deleting pre-existing fingerprints and starting from scratch haven't worked, as error messages are preventing new prints from being added to the devices. As usual, we'll update if we hear any official word from Google about the issue, hopefully regarding a fix.

Max Same here with my XL. elav Me too. No issues on my XL.. Nicholas Matranga My Nexus 5x works just fine after the update. kalehv Sometimes my Pixel XL asks for pattern even after it recognizes my fingerprint (no, I am not talking about the first time after reboot). Rebooting the device works but why does this happen? Nathan Bryant I've also experienced this. It's random. Not so often it's a bother for me. kalehv Yup not so often with me either but being a mobile developer what bothers me is this happening, not the inconvenience it causes. Nathan Bryant That totally makes sense. I assume it's some kind of error even though it's not stating that it is. I don't see the pattern or constant of what causes it when it happens. mattcoz It does that after more than 48 hours have passed since you've last used your pattern. kalehv Nop its not that either. It does that after 4 hours I think. And it should do that only once after 4 hours but not keep doing that until you reboot. mattcoz It's definitely 48 hours, that comes straight from Google. But if it continues to do so, then that's something else. Mgamerz I've had it happen on my Nexus, it just occasionally requires a PIN. Says it's 4 hours of non usage but that doesn't seem true, sometimes I wake up and no pin and sometimes I'll be on and off the phone and it'll require a pin.

He wasn't telling you to google that phrase, that is what google says when they release a new build of android. Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà Exactly. If it compiles, it's ready. No need to test or anything. Too much trouble for the geniuses at Google. They're so smart that if it compiles with just warnings, there couldn't possibly be any problems. John Doe I am sure that they do test it but there are things that go wrong...obviously those bugs will be in the spotlight on an Android blog meaning in real life they are probably affecting a small number of users. This is why you do a roll out of the OTA not just dump it all out there. Bruce Wayne Ohhh...Lol. I just re-read his statement now. thereasoner There's a petition for you guys to sign online but so far only 156 have done so and probably half of those are just haters without a Nexus or Pixel. Seems to me that the issues are isolated. Bruce Wayne Yeah, that must be it. You're not experiencing it so half of us are just haters and the issues are isolated. Yup, that's it. Thanks for the ingenious insight. thereasoner Even if all 156 are genuine it would still be quite a small number of users no? Bruce Wayne Except that's not the number of people experiencing problems. thereasoner Still, when there are well over 900 people in India signing a petition just for the 6p to have voLTE activated and the whole world combined can only manage 156 for this issue then it kind of says something imo. neates Pixel and Nexus - rich beta testers... Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà Rich alpha testers. asifalimirza No issues two weeks after the update. I have a Verizon Pixel XL Necronos Yeah, sometimes it doesn't wanna read my finger, really annoying and sometimes I have to reboot. Nope.jpeg If you are reading this, set you Disqus profile to private, if you'd like. I just found out today that it's available. EvilHowl That has been availiable since years Nope.jpeg >I just found out today that it's available.

It blows my mind been on 7.1.2 sense the factory imgs dropped Sean Same for me.....my Pixel XL hasnt had a single reported issue so far......... Donovan Goodwin Using mine actually causes phone to restart. Updating to 7.1.2 caused this and it even happens on ROMs. JG W00t! For once I don't suffer from Atrem's Luck... My 5X still lets me in with my fingerprint :) Doomberg I updated just last night. Glad I didn't get hit with this issue. nickarli 6P - had 4 fingers registered, right index stopped working after the update but other 3 still fully functional. I thought it was the massive amount of Utah dust in my fingers all of a sudden, but I guess not Defenestratus There's that vaunted Google QA again. This is how you get more Samsung. New_Guy Yep Mark Curtis What do you mean "this is how you get more Samsung"? 4Ui812 Why is Google having app many issues with the Fixel ? Sruly J Except since it's also affecting Nexus devices, this is more of a software issue in 7.1.2 than a hardware issue for Pixel devices. Defenestratus Because IIRC they use Agile software development. Agile is how you get shitty software. Lawstorant I've never thought I would say such thing, but I'm getting fed up with all the "issues" Google is facing with every update. On the Nexus 6, they went as far as to roll it back to 7.0. They should really step up their game especially if, they are fully responsible for every aspect of the device from now on. EvilHowl No issues on my 5X wade_county I thought these Pixels weren't supposed to be beta products? Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà They aren't. They're outrageously expensive alpha products. And they even have one defect (halo-cam) that can't be fixed in software. Still the best steaming pile of dog s**t of 2016, though. Everyone should buy one. Everyone who likes dog s**t anyway. Apparently people do, since HTC has shipped 2 million since launch. Kougeru I bad a Pixel for a week and took dozens of photos with no halo Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà Good for you. Phandroid did an LG G6 vs. Pixel photo comparison. 4 out of 22 Pixel pictures had halos. None of the 22 G6 pictures had halos. They were all pictures of the same things, obviously with the same lighting. Google admits it's a design defect. If Google admits it, it's kind of hard to pretend it doesn't exist. whispy_snippet No one denies it's an issue. But what you seem incapable of accepting is it's a very minor issue that only very rarely rears its head. If you actively try to shoot an image with a strong light source angled towards the sensor (something you generally don't do because it often results in a poor shot on any camera) you might experience a halo effect. Might. But I've got literally hundreds of photos taken with my Pixel with no halos. You can choose to believe whatever exaggerated narrative you want to fuel your juvenile rage fits. But people who actually use a Pixel every day don't seem to have a problem worth caring about. Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà It has nothing to do with a strong light source angled toward the sensor. That's normal lens flare. The Pixel halos are NOT normal lens flare. Like I said 4 out of 22 pictures. That's 18% of the pictures they took, and they didn't have strong light sources angled toward the sensor. 18% is not a rare problem, especially when the G6 NEVER had halos with the same exact pictures. Google admitted it's a flaw. Get over yourself and stop trying to justify it. whispy_snippet And like I said, I've taken hundreds of pictures and have seen a halo perhaps a couple of times. And I take a lot of photos given video and photography is my day job - indeed one of the reasons I chose the Pixel is because I wanted the best phone camera available for the times I don't have my proper gear with me. I've seen countless comparisons between the Pixel, iPhone 7 and Galaxy S7 edge and while they're all great, in most situations the Pixel takes what I consider the better shot. You're making mountains out of molehills and carrying on like a right twat in the process. P. Sherman ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE DOESN'T MEAN JACKS--- if in scientific tests under controlled environments and the same conditions, the Pixel produced the halo effect, which Google has acknowledged to be a design deficiency standard on LITERALLY EVERY PIXEL MADE, but other cameras feature no such halo effect. FFS whispy_snippet I'm not denying there's an issue! I'm saying it's being blown out of proportion by people who want to blow it out of proportion. P. Sherman Referencing a scientific, controlled test and camera comparison is NOT blowing this out of proportion. Blowing out of proportion would be something how the Wall Street Journal set out to destroy PewDiePie for boneheadedly saying "Death to all Jews" as a joke. But referencing a camera comparison in exactly the same conditions and one phone had a halo effect but the other didn't is science, fact, nothing to blow out of proportion there. Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà Good luck arguing with a Google fanboy in deep denial. thereasoner He's actually making solid points, the Pixels do have the best cameras overall‚Äã and all smartphone cameras have some issues. whispy_snippet No, no. I'm a fanboy! Get it right! Cecil Hardwood Are you sure the Pixel has the best camera ? The reason I ask is because the DxOMark site that claims this refuses to release the iPhone 7 Plus (Not iPhone 7) scores and many believe it is because it scored higher than the Pixel. The theory goes on to say that Google is using their score in their advertising and DxO doesn't want to piss off Google. Something weird is going on for sure. DxO claimed long ago the review was coming soon and should have been out by now with the iPhone 7 Plus having been on the market as long as it has. thereasoner If I'm to make a judgment personally then I would say that probably the top 3-4 cameras on flagships are very close and what's best as far as the user is concerned is subjective. Do you prefer low light performance(I do) or digital zoom? Do your favour widespread angle lens or fast launch/focus etc. Those are personal preferences that make "the best " phone different for different people. That said, as far as reviews are concerned the Pixel is generally considered the best over all. As far as your conspiracy theories go, who knows? Anyone can create those about anything but I guess but I'm thinking that other than digital zoom and an artsy photo effect the 7+ cameras are very similar to the 7. whispy_snippet The iPhone 7 Plus is the same as the iPhone 7 apart from an additional, slower lens. In terms of raw image quality the iPhone 7 Plus achieves its best results with the lens it shares with its smaller sibling. So basically, it'll score no better than the 7. It's effectively already been tested. Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà All smartphone cameras have some issues? What issues does the G6 camera have in the comparison I linked? 23% of the Pixel photos have halo issues. Find a serious issue with 23% of the G6 photos and get back to us. thereasoner Keep in mind that if you take wide-angle shots, angles will be distorted and elongated from the side, especially when it comes to selfies with the front-facing camera. I also found that the front-facing camera takes relatively muddy shots in low-light. Compared to the Pixel XL, OnePlus 3T and (for the time being since we don't have the S8) the Galaxy S7, the G6 is on par with its rivals. The Pixel XL takes superior low-light images than all the phones though, and I prefer the richer contrast and saturation of the S7 by just a tad. -CNET There are a ton of reviews from various sources just like this and while the G6 cameras are considered very nice they do have their shortcomings and generally rank below the Pixel cameras overall. Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà I wasn't saying the G6 has the best camera. I was saying that 23% of the Pixel pictures have halos and 100% of the G6 pictures do not. The halo problem is not a rare occurrence. I don't buy a phone for its camera. But if I did, and my only two choices were the G6 and the Pixel, I would definitely buy the G6. If my choices included other phones, I wouldn't buy the G6 or the Pixel. thereasoner It must be rare and only under certain circumstances because I've taken well over 200 pics so far on my Pixel and haven't seen it once. Just because one reviewers chosen testing parameters show the halo that doesn't mean that the test reflects real world use/performance from users like me. The so called halo thing wasn't even discovered in initial tests/reviews so does that mean there must be no halo? Going by your standards then I just need to pick a review that rarely shows it then. Unlike you, the camera is one of my top priorities when I choose a smartphone, I use it a lot so it's important to me and I couldn't be happier with the speed and quality of the Pixel cameras myself. It's no wonder that they're‚Äã rated so well and that most reviewers absolutely love it, halo or no halo. Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà Yeah, I believe you. 23% of the pictures on Phandroid, but 0% on your special magic Pixel. Totally believable, especially since you showed us all 200 of your perfect pictures instead of just saying so. Damn those Google liars saying it's a known defect. thereasoner Oh, I'm sure it's there it's just like early reviewers, I too haven't seen it yet but you're only interested in this one review apparently, no other reviews or user experience even matters unless it feeds your hate. Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà I know, damn those haters at Google saying it's a known defect. thereasoner The haters aren't the ones acknowledging the issue, it's those like you desperately blowing it out of proportion by using one review while simultaneously turning a blind eye to other more positive reviews and users real world experiences. Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà Users' real-world experiences are nothing but anecdotes. Initial positive reviews occurred before the defect was widely recognized and acknowledged by Google. And Google phones always get positive reviews because they're Google phones. Google could release a crayon drawing of a phone for the Pixel XL 2 and websites would call it the best phone of 2017. Websites can't afford to bite the hand that feeds them and lose both Google advertising and all the downstream advertising. HTC has shipped 2 million Pixel and Pixel XL phones since launch (and that figure doesn't account for all the returned and replaced phones). Obviously not many people see the superiority that you do. And don't bother with the "advertising" excuse. I see the Pixel advertised more than any other phone. thereasoner You really do live in your own little world don't you? Lmao! Have fun making up nonsense, you're only fooling yourself :-) Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà Psychological projection is a theory in psychology in which humans defend themselves against their own unconscious impulses or qualities (both positive and negative) by denying their existence in themselves while attributing them to others. whispy_snippet User real world experiences and positive reviews are irrelevant. Only the small amount of negative fringe reviews that deliberately focus on shooting in ways that reveal the halo matter. Right. Got it. whispy_snippet 23% of images taken by Phandroid or 100% of images taken in circumstances that are known to result in the halo effect. It's perfectly feasible to shoot hundreds of images with the Pixel and never see a halo. Look, ultimately no amount of reason is going to convince you because you obviously just hate the fuck out of Google. You simply insist that the Pixel has an enormous issue when it does not. So whatever. Good luck to you mate. whispy_snippet Hahahaha you're so weird!!! Why are you such a hater? What on earth? You're so completely irrational. Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà Disappeared? You're just not worth the time. But I came here to get a link and noticed your reply. So... Someone tell this guy he's a big fat liar: support dot google dot com/pixelphone/forum/AAAAb4-OgUsrROqMaXHqHg This Google fanboy is a big fat liar, too: highonandroid dot com/android-smartphone-news/the-truth-about-google-pixel-camera-halolens-flare-effect/ Here's that liar's video. He must have hacked the video to support his lies about there being a halo problem. www dot youtube dot com/watch?v=GUjhM2xcKSY whispy_snippet Yes, so as I've agreed many times now, there is a halo effect that sometimes (very rarely) occurs when shooting with the Pixel in specific circumstances. But I see you've conveniently ignored the chromatic aberation and purple flaring I pointed out in the G6 images. No surprises there. whispy_snippet Purple flaring and chromatic aberation. It's extremely noticeable in at least four images you shared with the Pixel comparison. Here you are: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatic_aberration And just Google search purple flaring. Sorry to burst your bubble. whispy_snippet Yep, as I suspected, radio silence once you got hit with a dose of reality. whispy_snippet Show me the link to the test. I would like to see it. Even if their results suggest there's an issue (which there is as we all agree), the significance of the results can still be blown out of proportion which is what we're seeing occur in this ridiculous discussion. Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà Here you go again. phandroid dot com/2017/03/27/lg-g6-vs-google-pixel-camera/ Now that I've viewed the pics again, actually 4 have obvious halos. One is subtle. Two involve a bright light. The other 3 do not. So that's 23% of 22 pictures. I wouldn't say that's blowing things out of proportion. In addition, some Pixel photos are blurry whereas the G6 photos are not. Yeah, you paid a lot for your Pixel, so you have a hard time admitting it's a steaming pile of dog s**t. I understand. whispy_snippet Yep, so as we've agreed, halos sometimes appear in shots with strong light sources pointing at or angled towards the edge of the sensor. But let's just ignore the purple flaring and chromatic aberation in at least four of the images from the LG, right? You're demonstrating selective criticism. Every camera has strengths and weaknesses but on balance, the Pixel offers better images than competing phones more often than not. My position is unchanged. You're both making mountains out of molehills, and in no way does this "scientific" test guarantee that 23% of photos taken with a Pixel will exhibit a halo. It simply shows 23% of photos taken in this example demonstrated halos. You're both being completely ridiculous. It's like some sort of sorry crusade to demonise a great product by focusing on a tiny negative while ignoring all the positives. No one ever said the Pixel is perfect. But only you two are using ridiculous, extreme labels like "steaming pile of dog shit" and "HARDWARE DEFICIENCY" as though using capital letters makes your odd ball assertions more valid. Most reputable tech reviewers agree the Pixel has the best overall smartphone camera. You're entitled to disagree. Marcelove "You're both being completely ridiculous. It's like some sort of sorry crusade to demonise a great product by focusing on a tiny negative while ignoring all the positives. " HAHA, yeah... Ridiculous is someone like you that ignore all negatives only to not feel bad about the choice of buying a Dead Pixel like you did. But a " photographer " like you said you are that chooses a device without OIS over others with it shows what kind of expert you are at photography. whispy_snippet I've posted this elsewhere but I'll post it again: If you did your homework on the way the Pixel captures images you'd know that it doesn't need OIS for still imagery. It utilises a complex process similar to bracketing - stacking multiple, fast, high-ISO exposures to create an image and then combining these multiple exposures to "erase" noise in the shadows. "Computational photography" is how this process is described and it's a new and innovative approach to overcoming the limitations of small sensors in smartphone cameras. Traditionally, OIS is useful in that it allows a camera operator to use slower shutter speeds. The reason you'd want to use a slower shutter speed? To let more light hit the sensor when in a dim environment and therefore capture brighter, more detailed shots. In most cameras, once you start dropping below a shutter speed of around 1/25th of a second you need OIS to offset hand shake. Even the tiniest amount of hand movement at these sorts of shutter speeds can result in blurry images. However, unlike any other smartphone camera, the Pixel overcomes the need for OIS by using "computational photography" instead. As things get darker, the Pixel can keep shooting at high shutter speeds and still capture sufficient light where other cameras can't. Video is a little different and I could crap on about why this is the case. But in short, I think the Pixel could probably benefit from OIS in this area. However, I think its EIS does a pretty good job and will only keep improving (because unlike OIS, EIS can be improved with software tweaks). The future of smartphone photography almost certainly lies in software which is why the Pixel's‚Äã camera is so exciting. If you want to get smarmy I'm happy to school you, mate. Marcelove STOP dude... WTF? Obviously you won't accept the fact that a Dead Pixel has flaws only because you paid a great sum for it... Usually people won't accept the reality of a bad choice, trying to turn a blind eye to not feel bad about their wrong decision and you are one of them. whispy_snippet Ugh. I'm wasting my time. thereasoner Haters going to hate. thereasoner Well over 200 pictures on my Pixel so far and not one single halo yet. I may come across one someday but overall the cameras have been absolutely fantastic! It's no wonder to me that these cameras are so highly rated, I've seen how good they are first hand. Why would a Pixel owner ignore there own results over a reviewers test that doesn't translate into said users real world performance? Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà Yeah, I believe you. thereasoner You don't have to believe me, believe all the initial reviews that failed to pick up on this obviously minor issue instead. P. Sherman 4/22. 4/22 photos from the Pixel have a halo effect. That's from Phandroid. That's 18% of photos the Pixel. That alone is damning. Google themselves have acknowledged that it is a HARDWARE DEFICIENCY and software fixes have done little to address this. They admitted it was there, that's all we need. If you knew that 4/22 Burritos Chipotle made would give you the Runs, but ZERO/22 Burritos Taco Bell made would, would YOU still choose to eat at Chipotle? whispy_snippet Show me the test! I've asked twice now. P. Sherman Lena Flare was removed from the photos, but not the video. http://highonandroid.com/android-smartphone-news/the-truth-about-google-pixel-camera-halolens-flare-effect/ Also, someone in the official Google forums shot with their Pixel and Nexus 6P in the same Time, conditions, everything. Guess what? https://support.google.com/pixelphone/forum/AAAAb4-OgUsrROqMaXHqHg/?hl=by Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà phandroid dot com/2017/03/27/lg-g6-vs-google-pixel-camera/ 3 halos are obvious, 1 is subtle. The subtle one is where the picture is looking up at a building's windows. Now that I've viewed them again, actually 4 have obvious halos. One is subtle. In addition, some Pixel photos are blurry whereas the G6 photos are not. tigerstown I paid $380 for my new pixel XL so it's not a lot and I have no Halo in my pics I have proven this on Twitter already. Marcelove "proven this on Twitter" https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/b672c337b9ea66b308150a002d3b0e7965c7903f926c609808fe53619dc81cd0.jpg abc More fanboy logic. I took pictures so everything is fine. Anyone who says its not fine is crazy. whispy_snippet How ridiculous. So a blogger takes 22 photos in various conditions and his experience is valid, but my experience of owning the phone and taking hundreds of photos in various conditions is not valid. You guys are weirdos. Marcelove Nope, you are a weirdo saying that from 3 phones ( S7, iPhone 7 and Dead Pixel ) you gave priority to the only one that doesn't have OIS. Worst, you work with photography... I feel for whoever uses your service... whispy_snippet If you did your homework on the way the Pixel captures images you'd know that it doesn't need OIS for still imagery.

If you want to get smarmy I'm happy to school you, mate. thereasoner You're just revealing yourself as a blind hater with your childish name calling of the Pixel. You're perspective is poisoned by the bias your hate provides. Your take on OIS is just another example. Google used high end VR quality sensors on board to assist with EIS and many reviews show excellent results from that as well but you're only interested in those that can give you your hate fix. whispy_snippet Yep, no response. Thought so. thereasoner That says it all right there, these guys are haters doing their thing and they will desperately cling on to any negatives‚Äã they can get while blindly ignoring results from owners in real world conditions. They can't help themselves, it's what they do. Andy But do you see problems with low light pics. I do on my wife's pixel. IPhone Looks so much better. I'm so disappointed whispy_snippet My wife has an iPhone 7. To my eye the Pixel kills the iPhone 7 in low light. In fact in almost every situation it bests the 7. The only area I'd give to Apple's phone is video. thereasoner Yep, and reviews show the same. Apple finally did improve low light performance with the 7 years after everyone else was beating them but the Pixel cameras are considered the best in countless reviews for good reason. Andy Maybe her phone is defected. Pixel photos in the bar this weekend looked orange and iPhone looked normal. Even. You moto z looked better. whispy_snippet Ok Jordan L I'll say that I snap a lot of photos with my Pixel XL.. I have seen the lens flare issue when there is direct full sun at a certain angle on the lens. Rare, but fun to reproduce for Pixel haters. Marcelove "You can choose to believe whatever exaggerated narrative you want " So I choose yours. abc I saw a rainbow once. Oh, are we not just conveying pointless ancedotes? thereasoner Mines been awesome thanks ! mr.fozzo On my Nex6P, I have noticed that the Fingerprint reader has been less reliable lately. It requires more presses than the usual 1 press. Besnik Rrustemi My Nexus 6P working excellent so far, no battery problems, no fingerprint problems (better standby times on 7.1.2 to be honest). But yes,i can agree that fingerprint was much faster when i first got the device on 6.0 Marshmallow (for unlocking the device with the fingerprint) now it takes like 2 full seconds for that :( jimv1983 No issues on my Nexus 5X and the swipe on the sensor to bring down the notification panel is great. Alex Harrison Flashed the OTA myself on my 5X. No issues with it. Jeff Neston At least it is just the sensor. My nexus 5 was bricked by a Google update.. it got the boot loop. Google support lied to me claiming I broke the power button. False it was not broken. I ended up going small claims case against Google. They settled, but wanted me to sign gag order. Sorry, no way. I sent it back and got complete refund. Sneaky company. What probably causes boot loop update to occur is phone on long time. Some apps get memory leak over time. System then unpredictably unstable. Then the system does auto uplate from Google without asking user NOR even rebooting or turning off prior to the update. Then during update, Os gets corrupted. Then after failed update phone reboots thinking the. Update completed. Now phones dead. And Google not bother to address the issue. Pdiddy187 My 5x fingerprint sensor was great until it bootlooped yesterday morning. LG is going to repair it under warranty even though it's well out of warranty. La Kiesha Rodriguez Barrientes I have the ZTE axon 7 and over a month now google hasn't addressed a fix for the play store not loading apps over data or Wi-Fi.. Without uninstalling updates to play store and then maybe will not say "waiting for network" so frustrating and then maybe download once and have to do that everytime.. Dumb.. P. Sherman That's been like that since KitKat. F------ KITKAT. ahnafm Is google reacommodating their customers now? Brett Delia I thought some positive feedback was worth being added. My Nexus 6P is working perfectly after the update. I've had generally a great experience with all my Android phones. I've had an iPhone as well as a Windows mobile phone as well in my past. None have been as feature packed as my Android devices. New_Guy This and all the other ridiculous issues with the Pixel is a big reason I stick with Samsung... flyonthewall Lol Fernando S Mine is working ok in my Nexus 5x running 7.1.2. It just failed once while I was on 7.1.1 and with a soft reset it came back to life Hank Is that a real screenshot in the story? Enrollment spelled wrong twice. SMH. ThisGuyFUX This is now icing on top of the cake, for anyone whom has enjoyed watching this crash and burn. If I paid $850+ for a Pixel, I'd be pursuing class action litigation by now. Slow clap. Sean Except its only affecting about 1% of the Pixels sold.........so......slow clap for you....... 2kool4skool It's gonna be sucks when you're in the 1%. And I doubt it's 1% anyway, this is probably the 20th article I've read about pixel's problems. That's alot. Probably more like 5%. whispy_snippet Thanks for your wholly robust and meaningful assumption. 2kool4skool Hey it's not scientific by any means but if you're like me who have read tons of articles about pixel's problems, you wouldn't blame me for assuming the problems are more widespread than just "1%". whispy_snippet It's called confirmation bias, mate. Look it up. 2kool4skool Dunno mate, call me bias or whatever, but all these articles do make me a bit paranoid about pixel. whispy_snippet "Confirmation bias, also called confirmatory bias or myside bias, is the tendency to search for, interpret, favor, and recall information in a way that confirms one's preexisting beliefs or hypotheses." Just a quick wiki search. abc Fortunately, not many Pixels have been sold so not many people are affected. Brian White Nexus 5x, running fine here ddevito If it wasn't for my OnePlus 3 I'd be on an iPhone. thereasoner One plus has their own issues/lousy support and the iPhone? They're the worst of them all when it comes to buggy software and hardware issues bricking devices ! ddevito Not sure I'd agree with you. My iPhone 6s hums along swimmingly without any issues. The more I use it the more I am leaning towards going back to an iPhone full-time. Apple, love them or hate them, knows how to deliver products, and support them. Period. thereasoner I'm glad that your iPhone 6s isn't affected by the many flawed updates and hardware issues‚Äã that have plagued various iPhones over the years but the fact remains that Apple has faced class action lawsuits filed by their own customers for serious issues like Touch Disease and error 53 and for good reason. They have the worst track record of them all and to make things worse they're known for both ignoring iPhone issues until said class action lawsuits are launched and/or blaming their customers for the iPhone hardware/software problems. BTW, my Pixel "hums along swimmingly" as well, that doesn't mean issues with the Pixel don't exist much less those far more serious issues found on iPhones ! MisterKraky I'm not having the fingerprint sensor issue myself, but after updating to 7.1.2, I can no longer install or update any apps! On a Verizon-issued Pixel here. ƒê·ª©c Th√†nh What happened to all the testing, Google? It seems they have become too reliant on using Nexus users for beta-testing and now can't seem to do a proper job on their own. Get your grips together, Android team. Rob H. Nougat is such a half baked disaster of an OS. It's ruined my N6. Marshmallow was soon much more stable. Thanks google keep breaking phones. jacob Cant even spell enrolment correctly. Enrollment...... PoisonApple31 Don't forget your apostrophe! Makes you look stupid when you are talking about spelling. "Can't" jacob grammar mistake not a spelling mistake :) PoisonApple31 I didn't say it was a spelling mistake. I said missing your apostrophe made you look stupid when you were talking about spelling.

Rakesh There is a known bug that after you unlock your phone the fingerprint sensor won't work for gestures - swipe down. There is no workaround for it so far other than to just press once and then it will start working. Adam Margeson Not sure what you're talking about. Doesn't seem to affect my Pixel. dontsh00tmesanta Guess I'm a lucky one mine is ok abc Premium bugs for your "premium" Pixel. mike shwilly No issues here. Not using fingerprint sensor at all though. Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà LOL!! So the solution to fingerprint sensor problems is not to use it. Check. Adam Margeson No issues here and I use mine all the time! whispy_snippet Ditto.

My Macbook Pro 2012 data cable fried in 2 years due to the Macbook's poorly designed unibody which acts as a fantastic heat conductor. "Genius" store crooks said I needed a new hard drive and wanted $150. Bought a $20 cable from ebay, watched a few videos and fixed it. Running fine 3 years later. Apple has known about this issue since 2007 but has never acknkowledged it. My Pro cost me more than 1400. I have had sub 500 Windows laptops easily run 5 years. Apple products(ipad excluded) are nice looking pieces of shit. Marco Antonio Maza Hern√°ndez What is going on with android? every update brings a new problem. mattcoz Has anybody had this problem in the final 7.1.2 release and not had it in the 7.1.2 beta? I finally got the OTA but am hesitant to update. Wesley I'm having this problem on the Nexus 6P. It won't recognize my fingerprint but I can still use the swipe gesture for notifications... This might be interesting. I went into settings to double check my Android version and tapped it to see the Easter egg (I forgot what it was.). When I noticed it was the stupid cat thing, I also noticed I could turn it off so I did. Now the scanner is recognizing my fingerprint again - not perfectly but it's better than nothing at all.

Published on May 5, 2017. 0 Google Play Services is a very important tool that comes pre-installed on Android devices. The tool is linked to the Android system and this is the reason why we suggest you to NOT disable it or else some of the applications might stop working properly. The Google Play Services is also automatically checking if there is an update for an installed application such as Google Maps. This way, you will not need to regularly check if there is an update for an application that you have installed on your device. As soon as an update is available for an application that‚Äôs installed on your Android device, you will get either notified or the update will be automatically installed (it depends on how you have set your device to react to updates). Google Play Services: How To Disable It You can disable the Google Play Services by heading to the device‚Äôs Settings->Applications->All->Google Play Services->Disable. As we‚Äôve told you above, Google Play Services is a very important tool on Android and if you disable it some of the applications, including those related to Google, will not function properly. Google Play Services 11.0.38 The latest Google Play Services version that has just been released is 11.0.38 and it can already be downloaded and installed on your device. The installation file has a size of 33.09MB, meaning that it is 2.11MB larger than the installation file of the previous version. Google Play Services 11.0.38: How To Install On Your Android Device First of all, you will need to enable the ‚ÄúUnknown Sources‚Äù option from your device‚Äôs Settings->Security. After that, you will need to download the Google Play Services 11.0.38 APK (installation) file from the internet. However, make sure that the website you‚Äôre downloading it from it is trusted, in order to not end up with a malware on your device. Finally, head to the location where you‚Äôve saved the Google Play Services 11.0.38 APK file and tap on it to start the installation process.

Published on May 5, 2017. 0 A close analysis of the 9.0 update to the Google Phone has shown a couple of suggestions regarding the future Android O features. This includes the Notification Channels that were also included in the developers preview. Despite being far from the official release, the hidden features give us hope that the team at Google is already getting ready for the release of Android O. More Features to Come Android Police tore down the Google Phone 9.0 APK, and according to their report, there are clear signs of support for Android O. Naturally, there are lots of things to be noticed there, but one of the most popular and anticipated ones is the new approach regarding alerts that will be implemented along with the new operating system to be released this year. Notification Channels Feature Android O will enjoy a feature named Notification Channels. This will allow you to decide which notifications you will receive from a particular app. As such, you won‚Äôt get flooded with notifications you‚Äôre not interested in. They will be divided into categories if you enter the Phone app: incoming and outgoing calls, voicemails and missed calls, for example. New Messaging Options Besides this feature, we will also see some other secret functionalities in the Google Phone 9.0 APK. Some of these are in-call picture messaging, post-call messaging and some dialer codes for Motorola, for example. Surprisingly enough, people discovered some images of dog and cat paws inside the APK, but nobody is sure what they really mean. You can sideload the app at any time from APK Mirror, but the features that were revealed are not official yet. Unless they are officially confirmed, the company can change their mind anytime and quit one or the other feature that was spotted here. However, people seem to be happy with these options, but it all depends on the developers.

Relationship ‚ÄúThe good relationship with our employees is as important for the overall picture as our products and client relations,‚Äù said Athanasios Zikopoulos, General Manager at Mundipharma Medical Company, in the statement. ‚ÄúSo we are considered as a particularly good employer on the jobs market, which is not only good for our reputation, but also positively affects retention and recruitment.‚Äù Among the large companies lower-paying firms like Ikea and McDonalds were in the top five. This is not a surprise for Michael Hermann, CEO of Great Place to Work Switzerland. He told the 20 Minutes freesheetexternal link that working conditions and perspectives were considered more important than pay. No indications are made which companies did not do well in the survey. Gender Gap The Gender Gap is however present in all companies, even the best-scoring ones, Great Place to Work Switzerland said. Both men and women tended to rate their companies in a similar way overall. But pay was a key factor. Although the survey cannot say whether there is a gender pay gap, the results showed that there was a perceived one among workers. More men (71%) than women (52%) said that they felt pay was fair. In addition, fewer women (75%) than men (85%) felt that they were able to take time off when needed. Hermann said that the difference over pay came from the difficult in combining both work and family. ‚ÄúIn Switzerland, women in particular often have to choose between children and a career.‚Äù¬† Other countries are further ahead, especially in Scandinavia, where the perceived difference over fairness in pay was a lot smaller, he said. swissinfo.ch and agencies/ilj Be the first to comment on this article: More...

How companies in Switzerland become best places to work

May 5, 2017 - 11:45

A new ranking shows the best firms to work for in Switzerland ‚Äì with Google topping the large companies for a third time in a row. Important to employees in all categories: a respectful and motivational work culture.


In all, 29 companies were awarded Best Workplaces in Switzerland in the Great Place to Work¬Æ¬†Award Ceremony in Zurich on Thursday evening. The results were based on a survey of 15,000 employees across the country.


Heading the large companies category (250+ employees) was Google Switzerland. Among the medium companies (50-249 employees) it was Mundipharma Medical Company which focuses on biotech and pharmaceuticals. Rackspace International, an IT firm specializing in storage and data management, topped the list for firms with 20-49 employees.


‚ÄúThe best employers in Switzerland are distinguished by a respectful and motivational workplace culture,‚Äù said Great Place to Work¬†in a statement. ‚ÄúIf 84% of employees rate their employer positively and then are also willing to make every effort for this company, then this is a key condition for the success of a company.‚Äù


It noted however that Swiss employees expectations of their employers were very high.


Relationship


‚ÄúThe good relationship with our employees is as important for the overall picture as our products and client relations,‚Äù said Athanasios Zikopoulos, General Manager at Mundipharma Medical Company, in the statement.


‚ÄúSo we are considered as a particularly good employer on the jobs market, which is not only good for our reputation, but also positively affects retention and recruitment.‚Äù


Among the large companies lower-paying firms like Ikea and McDonalds were in the top five. This is not a surprise for Michael Hermann, CEO of Great Place to Work Switzerland. He told the 20 Minutes freesheet that working conditions and perspectives were considered more important than pay.


No indications are made which companies did not do well in the survey.


Gender Gap


The Gender Gap is however present in all companies, even the best-scoring ones, Great Place to Work Switzerland said. Both men and women tended to rate their companies in a similar way overall. But pay was a key factor. Although the survey cannot say whether there is a gender pay gap, the results showed that there was a perceived one among workers.


More men (71%) than women (52%) said that they felt pay was fair. In addition, fewer women (75%) than men (85%) felt that they were able to take time off when needed.


Hermann said that the difference over pay came from the difficult in combining both work and family. ‚ÄúIn Switzerland, women in particular often have to choose between children and a career.‚Äù¬† Other countries are further ahead, especially in Scandinavia, where the perceived difference over fairness in pay was a lot smaller, he said. √ó Related Stories Internet growth Google expands in Zurich but tax structure remains unclear By Simon Bradley Internet giant Google is extending its presence in Zurich.

The relatives assert that by allowing Islamic State militants to spread propaganda freely on social media, the three companies provided "material support" to the group and enabled attacks such as the one in San Bernardino. "For years defendants have knowingly and recklessly provided the terrorist group ISIS with accounts to use its social networks as a tool for spreading extremist propaganda, raising funds and attracting new recruits," family members of Sierra Clayborn, Tin Nguyen and Nicholas Thalasinos charge in the 32-page complaint, which was filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles on Wednesday. "Without defendants Twitter, Facebook and Google (YouTube), the explosive growth of ISIS over the last few years into the most feared terrorist group in the world would not have been possible," the complaint said. Spokeswomen for Twitter and Google declined to comment on the lawsuit. Representatives for Facebook could not immediately be reached by Reuters on Thursday afternoon. Syed Rizwan Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, opened fire on a holiday gathering of Farook's co-workers at a government building in San Bernardino on Dec. 2, 2015, killing 14 people and wounding 22 others. Farook, the 28-year-old, U.S.-born son of Pakistani immigrants, and Malik, 29, a Pakistani native, died in a shootout with police four hours after the massacre. Authorities have said the couple was inspired by Islamist militants. At the time, the assault ranked as the deadliest attack by Islamist extremists on U.S. soil since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. In June 2016, an American-born gunman pledging allegiance to the leader of Islamic State shot 49 people to death at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida, before he was killed by police. In December 2016 the families of three men killed at the nightclub sued Twitter, Google and Facebook in federal court on allegations similar to those in the California lawsuit. Federal law gives internet companies broad immunity from liability for content posted by their users. A number of lawsuits have been filed in recent years seeking to hold social media companies responsible for terror attacks, but none has advanced beyond the preliminary phases.

(And more top Google queries answered) When you're searching for answers, Google's autosuggest feature lets you know what other people are looking for when conducting similar queries. In this week's installment of our Google Autosuggests series, we provide some answers to the most popular queries about Google's hugely popular mobile operating system. By Ed Bott for The Ed Bott Report | May 5, 2017 -- 11:00 GMT (04:00 PDT) | Topic: Mobile OS Google's autosuggest feature lets you know, sometimes with spooky accuracy, what other people are looking for when conducting queries similar to yours. So, with Google's help, we provide answers to a few of the most popular searches about Android. Can you use iTunes and FaceTime on Android? I combined these two Android-related questions, which are both at the top of Google's auto-suggested list, based on their common denominator: People want to know if some of Apple's flagship apps and services for iPhone have counterparts on Android. Let's start with iTunes. There's no program by that name for Android, but you can install the Apple Music app, which provides access to the Apple Music subscription service as well as any tunes you've matched or uploaded to your iCloud music library. As for FaceTime, sorry, the answer is an emphatic no. FaceTime uses proprietary protocols that work only on and between Apple-branded devices. Is Android free? As far as owners of an Android-powered phone or tablet are concerned, yes, the operating system is free. You don't need to pay anything for the code installed on your device or for updates. For device manufacturers, there's likewise no payment due to Google. Using Google services requires preinstalling a collection of Google apps, but even that's not mandatory if the company chooses to use the Android Open Source Project code instead. But there is one unexpected cost. Most major device manufacturers have signed license agreements with Microsoft that give them the right to use a collection of patents Microsoft owns that it says are infringed by Android. The exact terms of the agreements are confidential, but we know that Samsung paid Microsoft $1 billion for a single year's patent royalties. Does Android have Siri? Siri is yet another signature Apple feature that doesn't work on non-Apple devices. Google's alternative is Google Assistant. There's no guarantee that your phone will summon that Assistant on demand, though. The feature is still in its early stages. Google Assistant requires the Marshmallow or Nougat Android version with Google Play Services, on phones with at greater than 1.5GB of memory and 720p or higher screen resolution. It's also available at this time only in English and German. Your phone maker might have its own intelligent assistant. Samsung's Bixby, for example, is new on the Galaxy S8 series devices. But it's also just in its infancy. Can Android be upgraded? One of Android's great strengths is that you can upgrade any device to a new Android version, provided that the hardware supports that version. The catch? You have to be willing to wade deep into the weeds, flashing ROMs and rooting devices and probably voiding your device's warranty. If you aren't willing to hack your phone, you're at the mercy of the device manufacturer and the carrier, who decide whether they want to invest the time and effort to deliver updates to older phones. On a phone that's more than 18 months old, you're unlikely to be offered an upgrade. Ed Bott's 10 most popular Windows 10 tip... SEE FULL GALLERY 1 - 5 of 10 NEXT PREV Can Android phones get viruses? No operating system is immune from malware. Google's history with apps from the Google Play Store is pretty solid in terms of preventing malware from sneaking in, although there have been a few isolated slip-ups. You're much more likely to get into trouble if you install Android apps from unofficial sources. Doing so requires changing the default system settings on an Android device, and you probably shouldn't do that unless you fully understand the consequences and you're certain the package you're installing is from a trusted source. Is Android better than Apple's iOS? Reasonable people can differ on the answer to this question. They can also get into shouting matches and fistfights, in our experience. So we'll let you argue the pros or cons of that proposition without our help, thanks very much. More Windows 10 Does Windows 10 need antivirus software?

Directions, business listings, traffic updates, public transit information - Google Maps is probably that one app we use every time we go out. And it's not just us individuals. Cab drivers, food delivery executives, courier services, all depend on this indispensable app. And in this constantly evolving world, Google has been hard pressed to keep Maps app updated with new addresses and information. That is until the company decided to infuse some of its deep-learning tech into the app. In a blog post , Google revealed that it is implementing its deep learning techniques to Street View and Google Maps to make it easier to automate mapping new addresses. Street View cars go around cities and towns taking photos from the 360-degree camera perched up top capturing everything from shops, to streets, to houses and everything in between. Google will now be using the photographic data that these Street View cars bring on board to extract additional information like street names and numbers to improve the Google Maps experience. Yet, the photos that the Street View cars take are not always focused the right way. There may be discrepancies in the angle, the lighting, distortions, cluttered backgrounds, which make it difficult for a person to decipher the names and numbers. Over the past few years, Google has used crowdsourcing to help identify the content of the images. It was called ReCAPTCHA. But then it became impossible for humans to manually analyse over 80 billion hi-res photos collected by the Street View Cars to find updated or new information. Hence the Ground Truth team at Google infused artificial intelligence and deep learning to automatically extract information for the geo-located images. The deep neural nets makes the process of reading the content of the images automated. The latest algorithm has achieved a 84.2 per cent accuracy on challenging French Street Name Signs, significantly outperforming the previous state-of-the-art systems. Google has made the algorithm publicly available on GitHub through TensorFlow, Google's open-source machine learning software library. Google already uses machine learning to obscure faces and car license plates. Now it has started to use the technology to extract information from street signs. Google stated it was able to improve location data of one-third of the world's addresses. The company improved the software to take not only the street numbers into account, but also the names. The algorithm is capable of replacing abbreviations with full names too and ignoring any irrelevant texts in the photos. The same algorithm also helps to map new streets and add buildings that have not made it into the official maps of cities. It can also read the names of businesses enabling Google Maps to update information on business listings on the app. FacebookTwitterGoogle+LinkedinReddit Tags: Softwareneural networkneural netsmachine learningGoogle mapsGoogleartificial intelligenceApps Follow Gizmodo onfacebookLiketwitterFollowgplusFollow Contribute to GizmodoWrite for Us Next Story Sennheiser HE-1: The headphones god and Jimi Hendrix rock out in the heavens More from this author Return of the king: HMD Global says Nokia 3310 is now shipping again after 17 years Xiaomi will launch its first Mi Home store in Bengaluru next week Related stories Google Maps Gets Material Design Makeover Google Maps Timeline Lets You Stalk Yourself Artificial Intelligence Designed These Magic Tricks 10 Tricks to Make Yourself a Google Maps Master Google Maps, Amazon, eBay removes support for Apple Watch ‚ÄãNow Book An Ola Cab While Searching On Google Maps FROM THE WEB Latest Technology Inventions 2017 - Wall Street Wall-street Media Co, Inc.

Around seven million buildings are covered by the website, including those in major urban areas like Munich, Berlin, Rhine-Main and the Ruhr. Using this technology, homeowners can easily and precisely determine their home's potential solar capacity and generate plans for installing a solar system. All they need to do is enter their address online. E.ON, Google and software producer Tetraeder are joining forces to promote the expansion of solar energy in Germany. The Sunroof website brings together technologies like Google Earth & Maps, 3D models, and machine learning (i.e. automated software optimization) in order to answer inquiries as precisely as possible. Sunroof calculates how much sunlight falls on a roof during the course of a year. It takes into account weather data, the position of the sun in different seasons, the area and slope of the roof as well as shadows from surrounding buildings or trees. Then Sunroof "converts" the data on sunlight into energy and calculates the potential cost savings. During the platform's launch in Germany, "Sunroof" will be available exclusively at www.eon-solar.de. Interested homeowners not only can determine their solar potential, they can also assemble a suitable all-in-one package consisting of a photovoltaic module, an Aura battery storage unit and E.ON SolarCloud. Moreover, with its "Sunshine Guarantee," E.ON promises that a solar power system will actually produce the returns calculated ‚Äì and the company provides financial compensation for any shortfall. Karsten Wildberger, COO of E.ON, said: "With Sunroof, we are able to digitize sales of solar systems more intensively and thereby increase the appeal of photovoltaics. It clearly demonstrates the potential benefits of digitalization for the ongoing shift in energy production. "Along with Sunroof and E.ON SolarCloud, we will be developing additional digital products in order to offer our customers the highest degree of independence and security through E.ON solar systems." In the US, Sunroof has been in operation since 2015, covering some 60 million buildings. On average, 79 percent of all roofs tested proved suitable for solar power. Southern states such as Arizona achieved peak values ??of over 90 percent, but even northern states like Maine achieved values of over 60 percent. This indicates the considerable potential of solar. The rooftops in a city like Houston, Texas, could generate roughly 19,000 gigawatt hours (GWh) of electricity each year. That equals to the power requirements of 1.7 million households. "Google has been relying on renewable energy sources for many years in supplying the needs of its own infrastructure and beyond. With Sunroof our goal is to encourage more people tapping into the potential found in their own rooftops," explains Philipp Justus, Vice President of Google in Germany and Central Europe. To start, the online tool will cover about 40 percent of the German population. In the medium term, as many German households as possible will be covered. In parallel with this, the partners are examining whether the system can be rolled out to other European markets as well. In addition to "Sunroof", E.ON and Google are also partnering on the development of start-ups as well as in the areas of digital marketing and digital transformation.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile Gmail for Android Gets Anti-Phishing Security Check Feature to Warn Users for External Links By Zara Ali May 5, 2017 14Shares Share Tweet Submit Phishing scams are evil, and they feed on your data like a hookworm. Google has been facing the brunt of it on its various services. However, there is a reason why Google is known as the ‚Äútech giant‚Äù ‚Äì because of its immensely talented workforce that is equipped to tackle attackers. Doing what it should have done earlier, Google announced a new security feature for Gmail on Android that will warn users about malicious links. This feature on Gmail for Android will show a pop-up to warn you if you click on a suspicious link in an email. The pop-up would explain to the user that what the link has in store and if it is dangerous. Google published a blog post on its G Suite blog, which also shows the template message on the warning pop-up feature that is set to debut on Gmail for Android. Related Google Photos Comes Up With Mother‚Äôs Day Movie Maker Feature, But You Can Do Better Advertisement Here is the message that you will see in the alert pop-up on Gmail: The site you are trying to visit has been identified as forgery, intended to trick you into disclosing financial, personal, or other sensitive information.

BlackBerry KEYone review: A tale of a decent phone full of annoyances Jordan Palmer Follow View All Posts 2017/05/04 6:00am PDTMay 4, 2017 9 Plus 1 on G+ 19 Share on Facebook 47 Share on Twitter Total Shares75 Blackberry KEYone News Phone Reviews Reviews Article Contents 1 Specs 2 The Good 3 The Not So Good 4 Design & build¬†quality 5 Display 6 Battery life 7 Audio 8 Call quality & connectivity 9 Camera 10 Software 10.1 BlackBerry apps 10.2 Settings & general UI 10.3 Performance 11 Value 12 Conclusion The KEYone, the latest in the BlackBerry Ltd/TCL collaboration, is a phone that returns to the Canadian brand's iconic roots, for better or for worse. With Nougat and a strong focus on security, the KEYone is aimed at enterprise users and long-time fanatics. Overall, the spec sheet for this phone is nothing chart-topping. The SoC is over a year old at this point and the screen has been downgraded from the year-and-a-half-old Priv's, but using the KEYone was¬†mostly a pleasant experience until after about a week¬†with it. That was when I started experiencing rather noticeable slowdown and other problems. So what does a proverbial return to form for BlackBerry mean in the ever massive Android space? Well, there's not really a simple answer. But let's get going ‚Äî¬†we've got a lot to cover. You don't want to be here all day, do you? The unit that I've been using for the last week and some change¬†is pre-production. There have been a few hiccups with the software along the way, which I'll note in the appropriate section below. Most of these problems will hopefully¬†be fixed before the KEYone¬†is available for sale. Specs Display 4.5" IPS LCD 1620 x 1080; 434 ppi CPU Snapdragon 625 GPU Adreno 506 Software Android 7.1.1 Nougat; BlackBerry Security RAM 3GB Storage 32GB, expandable via microSD Cameras 12MP IMX378 (1.55Œºm) rear, 8MP front Battery 3,505mAh; Quick Charge 3.0 Misc USB Type-C 3.1, fingerprint sensor, 3.5mm jack, physical keyboard, NFC Connectivity 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac, dual-band; Bluetooth 4.2; LTE bands 1/2/3/4/5/7/12/13/20/25/26/28/29/30 Measurements 149.3 x 72.5 x 9.4 mm; 180 g Buy BlackBerry The Good Software The "stock" take on Android with BlackBerry's apps is great. It feels like what Motorola does: functionality added on top of Google's vision. It has the latest security patch and Android 7.1.1. Battery life My time with phones from the likes of Huawei and Xiaomi has somewhat desensitized me to stellar battery life, but the KEYone is definitely above average. Screen The color accuracy, brightness, and viewing angles are spectacular. The screen crisp and more than adequate, despite its odd size and aspect ratio. Fingerprint sensor I am not sure from where the fingerprint sensor was sourced, but it's almost on Huawei's level for speed and accuracy. Seriously, my success rate has been almost perfect. Build quality The KEYone is one hell of a solid device. The aluminium frame combined with the soft-touch back make the phone feel extremely durable. The Not So Good Ergonomics/weight The KEYone is chunky and is a bit difficult to hold. Typing with one hand on¬†the physical keyboard is also a pain. And even though it's only 180 grams, the KEYone feels very dense and heavy. Using it single-handed is not a pleasant experience for long periods. Speaker I know this should go without saying, but the speaker quality¬†on this phone is pretty terrible. Performance Major lag, homescreen redraws, and RAM management issues led to a phone that, after about a week of use, became almost unusable. Design & build¬†quality To give you some perspective on the KEYone and its design,¬†the marketing materials say that the phone is "Distinctly different. Distinctly BlackBerry." That last part, and to an extent the first, is quite true. BlackBerry (well, it's really TCL, but you know what I mean) has opted for what you might call the quintessential look that defined the heyday of Research In Motion. And while that seems like a negative at first glance, the KEYone's design exhibits¬†some modernization in its overall execution. This phone garnered more looks, comments, and questions in my time with it than any other I've used¬†‚Äî I'd say that it comes close to the amount of attention I received when smartwatches were still young. The physical keyboard is what drew people's eyes. The whole front face would throw anyone for a loop, especially when we're starting to see such high screen-to-body ratios these days. Not a single person that I've come across thinks that this is a pretty device... and I agree with them. The KEYone is not beautiful, elegant, slim, or anything else like that; it is aimed at a niche that, in theory, cares little for those things in a pocket computer. From the back, the phone looks fairly unassuming and normal. The soft-touch finish¬†feels¬†like it was ripped off of the good ol' OG Nexus 7. My fingertips glide across the band-aid texture, but when push comes to shove, my hand grips it solidly. Coupled with an aluminium frame, the KEYone feels sturdy, durable... and like a brick. To put this¬†kindly, it is one hell of a chunky phone¬†‚Äî I actually had 2010-2011 phone era flashbacks when I removed it¬†from the box. At 180 grams (6.35 ounces for you Imperial folks), the KEYone gets quite heavy in the hand after prolonged usage. See, I have this odd tendency to support phones with my little finger¬†while I'm using them; BlackBerry has made me decide to try to break that habit. I know that I mentioned it briefly, but let's talk seriously about the KEYone's keyboard. When smartphones were starting to trend toward on-screen keyboards, I was not happy. I liked the tactile response of my Droid and Droid 2, and haptic feedback was just not as satisfying. I had also not learned to type without looking on my G1 or HTC Hero, a problem I did not have with any of my Droids or BlackBerries. I eventually got over myself and became a solid fan of SwiftKey and the navbar¬†that Google brought to Android with Ice Cream Sandwich. Now that I'm all done reminiscing, let's get back to the topic at hand. The KEYone's backlit keyboard is really good, if not a little weird after spending the last several years with a¬†software variant. If I were a keyboard nerd like Ryan, I'd describe the travel distance, tactile feel, and the like ‚Äî I¬†just like my gaming mice and PC hardware. While the keys are much too small for my taste, I found that I actually had very few errors in general usage. Each one is easily pressed and responds with a solid click. The layout is obviously QWERTY (duh), so it's pretty easy to get to the point where you're typing fairly quickly. So far, the only things that have taken me some time to adjust to are the symbol layout and the placement of the left shift key versus ALT. Most of my errors have been activating the alternative mode instead of capitalizing the next letter. If you're into it, there are 52 programmable keyboard shortcuts that can open apps or contacts. For instance, you could assign a long press of 'c' to open Chrome, 'f' to start up Facebook, and so on. There's one catch, though: it's limited to the BlackBerry Launcher. In any other, long-pressing a letter will bring up a phone search for shortcuts and apps that are associated with that key. One of the other interesting features is the flick gesture, which inserts the first SwiftKey-like prediction when you, well, flick your thumb up the board. My biggest gripe about the keyboard is the fact that I have to see¬†it every¬†time that I am using the phone. Whereas the Priv has the sliding mechanism to mask its keyboard when you aren't using it, the KEYone's stares you in the face. This reduces the screen size to 4.5" and a 3:2 aspect ratio. I understand that this design choice was made¬†in the spirit of the BlackBerries of old, but I can't say that I am a fan. And if you don't like the physical keyboard or just don't want to use it all of the time, you can use the software version. However, unlike the Priv, this is not the best option. A full-screen keyboard on this smaller display is not the most pleasant of experiences. The fingerprint sensor is fantastic. Embedded in the space bar, it's lightning quick and very accurate. Only Huawei's sensors have proven so reliable for me, which should tell you something. The front of the phone has the screen, the capacitive navigation buttons, the keyboard, and the front camera (and earpiece/sensors) along the upper aluminium bezel. The back has the rather large camera module (there's still a hump, by the way, despite this thing being a brick) and BlackBerry logo. On the top of the frame, you will find the 3.5mm headphone jack. The left side only has the power button, while the bottom houses the speaker grilles and the USB Type-C 3.1 port. Finally, the right side is home to the SIM tray, volume rocker (which feels cheap and hollow) and what BlackBerry calls the "Convenience Key." Both it and the power button feel only slightly more solid than the volume rocker and I'd honestly rather see¬†one of them be textured or differentiated in some way from the other. Just because they're on opposite sides of the phone does not mean I didn't mix them up from time to time. The Convenience Key is a tertiary button that is customizable and can be mapped to almost any action you want. It can open a certain app, activate one of many shortcuts, or perform a few system functions like power off. At this moment, I have it mapped to Google Now since Assistant is tied to a long press of the home button. Let's just say that I've opened Now a lot more than I usually do. It's cool to see BlackBerry trying to¬†cater in some form to power users by adding in this key. At least this isn't chained to a useless virtual assistant. Overall, the KEYone is well-built, but it is a polarizing device in its design and construction. Some people will love it, while I think that most won't. It doesn't have the sneaky, incognito aspect that the Priv did, which is not necessarily a bad thing. Whether you like the look of the phone or not is entirely up to you¬†‚Äî I'm just not the biggest fan of it. Display When discussing the KEYone's display, most will inevitably focus on the aspect ratio, i.e. its general shape. BlackBerry went with something decidedly more square than what most of us are used to. Despite this, the 1620x1080 IPS panel is crisp, clear, and quite bright. I am rather¬†fond of the color reproduction, and I found this to be one of the more accurate panels that I've used. There's even an sRGB mode. The viewing angles are superb and the screen is just a joy to look at. It also gets very bright for outdoor use. The display is not the KEYone's strongest aspect, but nor is it the weakest. The resolution is more than adequate especially given the total screen size. There really isn't that much more to say on the matter: great screen, awesome colors, but it won't blow you away. Battery life With a 3,505mAh battery, you'd expect the KEYone to last a long time. I mean, that's one of the features that BlackBerry is hoping encourages¬†people to buy this phone. The good news is that it is certainly above average. After using Huawei and Xiaomi devices for the last few months, I have gotten used to a phone that can easily get me through a day, so I am glad that this one¬†continues the trend. During my testing, I had the screen at 100% brightness with plenty of texting, emailing, messaging, and several attempts to¬†watch YouTube videos and play games. Not only did I get over five hours of screen-on-time, but the idle drain on the battery was practically negligible. The largest battery to ever come in a BlackBerry phone and the screen resolution help to contribute to the¬†claim that you can get 26 hours of "mixed use," but if you run low, Qualcomm's Quick Charge 3.0 is supported. When you plug the phone in, you are presented with two options: Charge Only¬†and Boost Mode. The latter is touted as "giving you the most efficient charge possible, even if you only have a few minutes." Good on BlackBerry for making another phone with good battery life. It's pretty damn stellar. Audio When I¬†think of a BlackBerry, I don't always picture a phone with the best sound quality and output. Sure, it might get the job done, but you know what I mean. In all fairness, the KEYone is not meant to be your media player¬†‚Äî rather, it's not supposed to be the one on your desk that pleases your ears the most. It gets the job done, that's about all I can say. The sound that pushes out of the headphone jack is tolerable and works just fine for the gym or other activities where you won't be lugging around high fidelity cans. The external speaker is subpar, even considering that this is a smartphone. For music or notifications, there is plenty of distortion and crackling at 80%+ volume. The cacophony at that level is awful, so I've left the KEYone in vibrate-only most of the time. At least the phone has a good vibration motor. Call quality & connectivity When I first received the KEYone and inserted my SIM card, I was sorely unimpressed. Mobile data would not work due to a problem with the APN settings and the phone presented me with an annoying notification telling me that there was a problem. After some digging and chatting with "people in the know," I found out that this was a known issue with this¬†pre-production build of the software and it was being addressed in preparation for the final release. After manually setting up the APN for my MVNO carrier, my wireless connectivity has been passable. Call quality reached my expectations¬†‚Äî Bluetooth and WiFi have also been reliable. I have had my LG Watch Urbane (Android Wear 2.0), Moto 360, and Samsung Gear S3 connected to it during my entire usage. None have had any issues staying connected, nor did I have trouble with any of the Bluetooth headsets I tried. Reception, however, was another matter entirely. The phone constantly dropped calls or failed to make them at all. I also frequently lost data connection or experienced slower speeds than what I am used to on my carrier. The KEYone also experienced cell signal holes that have never been there¬†‚Äî I went through a hole near my house every day, but all of my other devices were just fine in the same area (same SIM, etc). It was extremely frustrating. Camera I'll admit: I went into all of this not expecting much from the camera. Come on, it's a BlackBerry. But seriously, the KEYone's is legitimately good. It performs well in low-light environments with post-processing that is kind to photos. I'm certainly glad to see BlackBerry carry on where the Priv's camera left off. With all of that being said, it cannot¬†quite¬†hold its own next to¬†the Pixel, GS8/GS7, or even the P10. The KEYone can put out good-quality pictures that are crisp in detail, but with some aggressive smoothing in post-processing.¬†Those of you who pay attention will notice that the KEYone packs the same sensor as the Pixel, the IMX378. While that certainly can lend itself to good photos, it's not the be-all, end-all. My opinion is that this is one of those phones where it's more difficult to take a bad picture. This camera is like a jack-of-all-trades¬†‚Äî you'll get great outdoor, indoor, and nighttime photos. Will they have that so-called "Wow!" factor? Well, that depends on you. Moving around to the front, BlackBerry opted for an 8MP fixed focus, 84¬∞ wide angle shooter. LCD flash is also included. Supposedly, this is best suited for those video conferences where you're not in a position to get somewhere with better lighting. This is the official blurb on the matter: "For times when you have to take a video conference on the go, the device includes an 8MP front camera with fixed focus, LCD flash, and 84-degree wide angle lens." Just own up to the fact that you put in an LCD flash for selfies; there's nothing wrong with that. Wrapping all of this up, let's go over the camera UI. It's basic, but in a good way. In Auto, you are presented with the upper bar that has the settings for flash, timer, aspect ratio, and HDR, as well as¬†the general options. Along the bottom is the gallery preview, front/rear camera switcher, shutter button, mode selection, and visual effects. In the options, you have the control mode, where you choose between auto and manual. Then there's the JPEG fine or standard compression choices, face detection, and video resolution stuff. The KEYone¬†can go all the way up to 4K30fps, but you lose "enhanced video stabilization" above 1080p30, which is kind of a bummer. Contrast this camera app UI with something from Huawei and you'll see why I am a huge fan. There aren't as many options, but what's there is useful and mostly necessary. Good job, BlackBerry. Previous Next Software When the Priv launched a year and a half ago, the general consensus seemed to be that the software was good. Much like Motorola and OnePlus, BlackBerry has gone with a "stock+" take on Android, i.e. where Google's vision is kept intact, but useful features are added on top to better the user experience. The KEYone follows the same logic, though with Nougat 7.1.1 running underneath¬†this time around. The BlackBerry brand is built on security, reliability, and stability. When the company shifted over to Android from the corpse that was BB OS, it brought with it some of the hallmarks upon which it had built its reputation. There was a commitment to updating to¬†the latest monthly security patches, the DTEK security suite, and even some hardware modifications that all helped to ensure users had the safest and most secure take on Android. Now we're here with the KEYone and that focus is still on-point. On the surface, the software looks like stock Android, but there's a bunch running under the hood, from the apps to the settings and options. I'll go through both¬†of those elements in their own sub-sections to follow. I think you'll be as surprised as I was in regard to the level of depth and detail with each addition made. Not all of it is useful, in my opinion, but it's there. BlackBerry apps This is one of the pillars for¬†BlackBerry's plan to draw potential customers. My time with BlackBerry's¬†phones was so long ago that I hardly remember what BB OS was like (and I never even used v10). Even if I did, I can tell you right now that I was not a hardcore user, so the KEYone gave me my first experience with a lot of the apps that BlackBerry loyalists swear by. The Hub app is where it's at, at least in terms of sheer power user capability. This functions as a place where you can see all of your messages, emails, texts, and other related¬†notifications. It pulls from Gmail, your default SMS app, IM services, and various social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, and LinkedIn. Due to the volume of incoming emails and the email-fu that I am forced to do each day, I ignore Gmail in Hub. It was just too difficult since it still doesn't support the tabbed inbox or filters/labels as well as I'd like. You can also set up custom views for Hub, where you select what accounts will show up¬†‚Äî this is how I was able to successfully "ignore" Gmail. For enterprise users, this could be the way you separate your work and personal data. While this is all great, I frankly got bored when trying to make Hub work to my advantage. It can take a lot of work, time, and effort to get it the way you want it. I have no doubt that some people will do this, because there is much power to be had in the app, but it is not for everyone. ¬† Nipping at the heels¬†of Hub in terms of marketing importance, we have DTEK. Though it's still being hyped just like it was when the Priv launched, it¬†remains a mostly useless, feel-good example of the placebo effect. You're presented with red Xs, yellow exclamation points, and green check-marks that denote your level of security in various areas. It's a centralized location to show the average user the basics of Android security, which isn't a bad thing. I suppose I am shrugging it off because I know what I'm doing when it comes to this stuff and my perfectionist/completionist nature hates not seeing green check marks. Since I am not going to change my usage habits, then I might as well not look at annoying yellow exclamation points. For those of you who are wondering what my DTEK status is, I am sitting firmly at "Fair." As annoying as that is, at least I am using¬†a BlackBerry device (because that's one of the security checks). I can sleep a bit better tonight knowing that. If you hit green on all criteria, then your needle will be in the "Excellent" range on the gauge. Good for you. ¬† DTEK is actually worth a damn when it comes to showing what apps are accessing certain permissions and notifying you when they do. Or¬†you can have it¬†inform you when a specific application is requesting certain permissions. For example, I can tell DTEK to let me know¬†when something accesses my calendar or to notify¬†me when Action Launcher alone tries to read it. There are certain people who will love this¬†‚Äî I am not one of them. BBM is here, for some reason. It's still the same old app and I really don't feel like going over it. Basically, if you use BBM then you know what it is. If you don't, you're not missing much. There's still no SMS functionality; Android¬†Messages is your default out of the box. The Calendar app is cool, I guess. It still has the "Meeting Mode," which automatically silences your phone when you're in a meeting according to your calendar. There are also options for creating events in different time zones from the system one and whether or not the app informs you if events conflict. It's a neat take, but I wouldn't call it special. Finally, there are various note-taking, task, password management, and photo markup apps. None are particularly worth paying attention to¬†and I am sure there are better offerings from either Google or other third-party developers. I don't want to waste too much time with them. Settings & general UI Apps are great and all, but what about overall user interface? Like I said, the software is "stock+" Android. It looks, feels, and functions much like Nougat would on a Nexus or Pixel, but there are additional options¬†to play with. Most of them lie in the display settings menu, so I'll address some of them. There's the color balance slider (for cool or warm, or somewhere in between) How you want the Recents menu to look ‚Äî you have the choice of Rolodex, which is the normal way, Tiles, and Masonry A green bar along the edge of the screen that shows the battery level¬†remaining while charging (it's neat and I've seen it before in custom ROMs) An option to double tap to wake/sleep the phone. There's one final piece that I want to address in more detail. It's called the Productivity Tab and it exists as a small white bar on the far right edge of the screen (its position and thickness can be adjusted). If you've used Action Launcher and the Quickpage feature, then that's basically¬†how this works. If you have no idea what I'm talking about, the Productivity Tab pulls out from the side of the screen and has five sections. The first is a calendar widget showing you what you have going on that day or the next. After that¬†is a Hub shortcut to show you any unread messages. Sections 3 and 4 are a todo and contacts list, respectively. Finally, there's a settings sub-menu for the Tab, where you adjust position, transparency, height, thickness, etc. I like the Productivity Tab for little more than the calendar widget, which is exactly what I use the Quickpage for in my default Action Launcher setup. ¬†¬† The other addition you'll see in the system settings is for the Convenience Key, which I mentioned all the way back up closer to the top of this review. It's the thing under the volume rocker that looks/feels exactly like the power button. Oh, yeah, you can map it to open whatever app or shortcut you want. I find it mostly useless. but some may find it to their liking. The sub-menu itself is pretty straightforward: it shows you what the key does, what action is currently assigned to it, the option to clear said action, and a short list of what you can map to it. Here's what's available to choose: "Open app" will bring up a list of everything you have installed "Speed dial" allows you to set a contact to the key (don't do this) "Send message" allows you to open either an email or a text to send to a specific contact "All shortcuts" brings up a long list of all the shortcuts that BlackBerry thinks you could ever use/need. Once you make your choice, that's what the Convenience Key will do until you select something else. It only works when the screen is on and unlocked, so keep that in mind. There's a gestures section, but it only has the toggle for the double-tap power button for camera shortcut. Not sure why this is off on¬†its own, but whatever. The sound settings still has the "Notify during calls" and "Flip to mute" options¬†‚Äî I disabled the former because who needs that. The security area is actually almost stock, except for the picture password. By the way, skip that, too. Developer options has the sRGB mode toggle I mentioned earlier (which always turns itself off when I back out of the menu), but it's missing the OEM unlock entry. Because this is BlackBerry, so no unlocking or rooting for you. Everything else is all the same as a Nexus or Pixel. BlackBerry Launcher, the default out of the box, is pretty basic. You have the option for those keyboard shortcuts and little else of note. After I toyed around with it for a bit, I moved¬†on to Action Launcher. The notification shade and Quick Settings are also just like stock with the same animations and everything. ¬† If you're super paranoid about people peering¬†over your shoulder to look at the stuff on your screen, BlackBerry provides you with the Privacy Shade (via the Play Store). This prevents others¬†from physically seeing private and sensitive content by blocking out everything except for a tiny viewing area. How big this little window is depends on what size you want, but even with Privacy Shade active, you can still interact with your screen. It's neat, I suppose. You can adjust the shape and background transparency via the little menu that appears when the Shade is active. Performance The Snapdragon 625 powering all of this is not too bad of a chip. Though decidedly midrange and a year old at this point, it carried the KEYone along better than I would have thought initially. However, after about a week, the lags, stutters, and hiccups started to settle in, with the most noticeable being¬†exiting the camera app, constant homescreen redraws, and apps not remaining in memory very well. The camera thing was especially bad when I used the power button shortcut to launch the camera from a locked state; exiting after this caused the phone to hang for almost thirty seconds. Following that, there'd be another forty-five seconds of unresponsiveness, even from the fingerprint sensor or power button. Suffice to say, it was quite annoying and dismaying. I am not sure whether this is a bug in the pre-production software or not; regardless, it was irritating¬†and made using that shortcut more than useless. As time went on, the sheer sluggishness of the phone became quite apparent. Animations would lag, the whole OS would hang when launching apps at random intervals, and my homescreen redrew¬†every time I went back home (I used BlackBerry, Action, and Nova Launcher¬†‚Äî all with the same result). I also experienced some seriously aggressive RAM management/problems. As an example, I opened a new app for the first time and needed to sign in. I knew my password, but needed my 2FA code. Switching over to Authy, I grabbed the code and double-tapped the recents button to switch back to the original app... only to find that it needed to reload, requiring my credentials again. After all of that, the 2FA code had expired. Rinse and repeat; I just used Authy on my PC to get signed in after a near instance of rage quitting. That's just a singular example, but things like that happened often. Geekbench 4 was having troubles The Adreno 506 GPU¬†is pretty capable, though. The only problem is that there is no reason to game on this phone¬†‚Äî not only is the screen quite small for such an activity, but the keyboard and overall design of the phone's face make gaming uncomfortable. The GPU is just¬†wasted potential, I'd say. These issues could be related to this pre-production hardware and software, but there was a point at which the KEYone became unusable. These problems persisted through reboots. Performance for the first several days was quite good, but it deteriorated very rapidly. Surprisingly so, actually, which made the disappointment I felt seem worse. I should note that I will be retesting everything¬†with a production model when the phone¬†is released to see if these issues persist. Value As we near the end of this journey review, I'm left with a few¬†questions. The one I will ask and hopefully answer in this penultimate section is this: Is the KEYone worth it? Besides the horribly stylized name and physical keyboard, what is the value proposition of this phone? It will retail for $549 USD, which puts it at the high end of the midrange spectrum. That's still a hefty sum for a year-old SoC and some very fast performance degradation, even though both of those¬†come with a decent screen, good camera, and awesome overall software experience. Even with all of the security stuff and the keyboard, I am not entirely convinced that $549 is a good price. $349 is probably the most that I would pay for this phone, especially when you consider that a Pixel is $100 more than the asking price ($650) or that a OnePlus 3T starts at $440. Both phones come with better internals, a similar overall UI/UX, and better¬†cameras. What makes the MSRP even more painful is the subpar performance (note: again, this could be related to the pre-production hardware/software), something that I cannot in good conscience ignore or fail to mention in this regard. You will be much happier with what OnePlus, Google, and even Samsung have to offer you. BlackBerry is likely going to aim this at the enterprise, which may not care about the price tag as much as us normal consumers. Those users, however, do want a phone that's going to work well no matter what they're doing. The long and short of it is that if you're considering this phone as one of your options, then I'd say go with the OnePlus 3T as the best value for your money; if your budget is a little more flexible, then go with a Pixel or Galaxy S8. If you're really interested in one of these, just wait until they go on sale. Conclusion So who is the KEYone for, exactly? According to¬†BlackBerry, it's meant for: "people who use their phones more for communication rather than media consumption, people who are tired of having the same one¬†as everyone else, people who are professionals and rely on their phone to get things done, and people who are looking for something¬†durable that will last through a busy day." If you want my opinion (and you did just read this whole thing, so why wouldn't you), I would say that the KEYone is for the BlackBerry power user of yore. I never was one, but I do know a few who still¬†talk about their old phones. This phone is for them. Minus the DTEK50 and DTEK60, the KEYone is BlackBerry's (and TCL's) latest real attempt at the Android side of things since the Priv. From my time with it, the KEYone failed at providing a good user experience, even¬†though it is¬†a little eccentric and anachronistic in a cute way. BlackBerry returned to its roots with this phone, its aim fixed squarely on the¬†fans of old. Personally, I happen to prefer the glass slabs that we have nowadays and I think that the KEYone is a relic of a long bygone age. I eventually adjusted¬†to the form factor and physical keyboard, but even after reaching that point, I still did not enjoy typing (versus my current neutral feeling on the matter with the software versions). Simply put, I do not like the KEYone. I do, however, appreciate a solid, well-built device even if it is a brick. But good construction is only a single criterion when evaluating a device for recommendation and I don't think that the average consumer or even an Android nerd would enjoy using this phone. It's kind of ugly, bulky, dense, and one of the main draws, the keyboard, is a novelty at best. This is definitely a niche product and I usually frown on that because it's so limiting¬†‚Äî honestly, that's probably just the business student in me talking. BlackBerry/TCL clearly have a target market for the KEYone that they believe is slavering for it¬†(I am certainly not in it). That being said, narrowing down to a specific demographic does not excuse a poor user experience. I've said it plenty of times in this review, but I'll say it again: I know that the model I have¬†is pre-production hardware and software. Bugs, janks, and other oddities are to be expected. There was supposed to be an update for the review units, but I have not received it as of this writing. I like what the KEYone is trying to be and do.¬†It's a quirky little thing that was actually fun to use sometimes just because it's so different. The "stock+" Android¬†is also quite refreshing and helped to subdue some of my frustrations early on. But being unique with great¬†software cannot carry a phone through the trials that this phone presented. And no, the irony of this is not lost on me¬†‚Äî I usually get the phones with outstanding hardware and bogus software. The Snapdragon 625 is a decent chip in its own right; on paper, I should have never had the problems I did. Odds are, either you have already decided that you want one of these or your company's IT department will purchase them in bulk. In both of those cases, I wish you the best and hope that you have the best experience that this phone has to offer. Perhaps the issues I've had will be fixed with production hardware or a few software updates down the line, or maybe it's all been down to bad luck in the silicon lottery (#jordansluck). But I just have a feeling that the KEYone will go down as one of those Android phones that has a cult following, but is ultimately worth more in a few years as an antique than as a daily driver today.

It probably has its niche, but I agree that the era of the keyboard phone has passed, and for good reason. I'll take my big screen and easy one-handed typing, and honestly, I sincerely doubt I would ever be faster on a hardware keyboard. We're all so used to software boards and such autocomplete wizards that I bet 90% of people out there would never get close to matching their speed with a touchscreen on one of these chiclet boards. I also don't really think the camera seems like anything all that special, at least based on the samples here. Nick Becker Honestly, the physical keyboard was the only reason I was considering getting one of these. What I really want, though, is a new version of the HTC G2/Desire Z. YaKillaCJ I still have 1 in a drawer somewhere. That device was awesome and innovative. Hmm, maybe if HTC should look into the keyboard. Nick Becker I still have mine, too. It's just too old now for modern apps. Good_Ole_Pinocchio Phone with a 625... If you're not getting the Z Play, you're doing it wrong.... And well I completely agree with you on hardware keyboards being ridiculous in 2017 robogo Lenovo P2. Same specs, 5100 mAh battery. steadymobb Will the p2 ever get 7.0 though? Prob not... Sohit Especially considering the LG G6 is on sale for $500 Francois Nguyen I actually HATE most touchscreen keyboards, even if if's for typing small messages. I even hated landscape mechanical keyboards because I always break the sliding mechanism over time -_-. Being used to portrait mechanical keyboards (and old PC keyboards from the 90s) for so long, the only cellphones that lasted for me were a BB Q10 for 2 years (and a Palm Treo 680 for 5 years before that). I abused the heck out of Android Runtime for gathering my most needed apps. I tried iOS for 1 year and never got used to the keyboard. I tried several Android phones that didn't last 3 months for me. I'm glad now that the KEYone will show up in June 2017, even if it's WAY too late for me and I'm ironically not interested in buying it lol. Jack ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà mostly nostalgia. Honestly I will buy it if the price drops to $400 level YaKillaCJ My bet is the lags are due to stock 7.1.1. The 625 is very capable of everyday task proven by other OEMs. Something Xiaomi's Miui has a huge advantage over nearly everyone, optimization while including plethora of features. Proven by the Redmi Note 3 Pro (SD650) and Redmi Note 4x (SD625). Plus this price is just too much and I said it when it was announced. Yet so many nay sayers were upset at my comment siting its niche product. While a Niche allows it to be sold for more than Xiaomi and Huawei offerings, it doesn't justify pricing past Flagship specs. This cost more than OnePlus 3/T, ZTE Axon 7 & Xiaomi Mi5 that offer Flagship specs/hardware, thriving OEMs and update history. Not to mention Miui and OxygenOS. Blackberry should drop the price and use Android 7.0 instead until Google themselves stabilize Android 7.1.x. Miku is Best Vocaloid I don't think it's an issue with the Android version. My Moto Z Play has been running LineageOS ever since it became official and I haven't encountered any lag issues, even after a few weeks. If an unofficial version of 7.1 can run perfectly on the 625, there's no reason OEM 7.1 can't run properly on it. YaKillaCJ My key words were stock. As in they never optimized the Android software. Great examples is how Miui and OxygenOS takes whatever version and clearly tweak and optimize it. So I'm not surprised LOS runs great, it includes a modified/optimized kernel, drivers, blobs, default apps, etc tailored for your device. Throwing straight up stock versions of Android that basically just runs without optimization nor bug fixes is something TCL is known for. Look at Blu for example. HabsSuck what a hate on commentary, come to expect it from some HumbleButBlunt Although I agree with your comment I find it hilarious coming from someone who's screen name is "HabsSuck". DEVVVV Too bad BlackBerry continues to do what got them in trouble in the first place. this is due to total lack of innovation. Blackberry was a one hit wonder and if they don't get someone in there that possesses innovation they are done. HumbleButBlunt They are already done making devices... Nate650 Total lack of innovation!? This phone showcases innovation in many ways, such as the capacitive keyboard which they have a patent on. The same can't be said about the popular iPhone. All Apple has basically done in the last five generations is change the screen size. Michael Tran Does it have always listening "ok google" That would be a dealbreaker for me if it doesn't have it. Pat Richardson Your reasoning about the keyboard does not work for me. "Easy one hand typing" isn't even a thing anymore now that phones are 5.5" to 6" and touch/swype (word prediction selected "tofu") is a pain because of poor predictions. Since there is only one small flag ship phone (Sony xperis compact) one hand typing shouldn't even be an argument against a physical keyboard, which is more accurate, quick, and does not require looking at the keys. Every other word on swipe I swear I have to rewrite because of horrible predictions. And touch doing is no better since you cannot feel the keys I agree with everything else toy said about the phone though. Marcelove Start using Swiftkey and stop complaining...üòâ Pat Richardson That's funny because that's what I'm using ToniCipriani ‚úìp«ù·¥â…ü·¥â…π«ù å I used it. It's sh1t. As with every other bajillion VKB out there. I don't need keyboards that try to learn and output what it thinks I'm typing. I need a keyboard to output what I type, nothing more. Capacitive screens are inherently inaccurate. Imparus The size isn't really an argument when it comes to keyboard, pretty much every keyboard support "one hand" mode, where you can make it smaller, so even if it is big you can still reach all the letters with one hand. Pat Richardson While I can concede to this, phones are no longer small enough for one-hand general use. Trying to tap that top right button with your left hand puts you at risk of dropping your phone, so you mostly operate your phone with two hands anyway. To make a keyboard smaller for one hand typing is counter-intuitive for a screen size that's more operable with two hands. Maybe during situational uses the one handed mode is fine. Anyway, despite this argument the physical keyboard I find is much more accurate and comfortable than touch typing. Chris Oh "LCD" flash??? David Ruddock The screen flashes white. DEVVVV the screen flashes white?? So that must mean only for selfies. what if I am doing a recording? and want to see how it is recording in real time?? ecnjnr Tbmobn fby Uo B Mayoo Did it hurt when you fell on your keyboard? Kieron Quinn Maybe they just put their KEYone in their pocket ecnjnr 6P ;) ecnjnr My virtual keyboard posted this from my pocket, lol. Can't wait for a physical keyboard phone. Mayoo http://whatyearisit.info/img/what_year_is_it.jpg ecnjnr 2017 :) Miku is Best Vocaloid There's something called "locking" you may have heard of it :^) Cinj Still don't understand why BB dumped their own OS in favor of Android, especially since BB10 was capable of running Android apps. That's like buying a Mac just to format the drive and put Windows on it, what's the point? I bought my mom a Blackberry Classic and it's a great little phone especially for more tech challenged people who don't need or want all the bells and whistles that come with the two major players. If BB is going to shift to just making mediocre Android phones, they may as well close up shop already. Francois Nguyen Some reasons I guess (based on my own experience with BBOS 10): - Software AND hardware issues on double-tapping on the hardware keyboard - lack of apps - lack of support from major players (facebook, BB itself) Cinj My response to each point: - No opinion since I haven't encountered this - 99% of apps are garbage so no big deal - You can't as easily help clog the internet with pics of the unimpressive food you just ate, unfunny memes, and "like, share, and type amen or you're going to hell" spam? How will humanity survive??? - Quite the opposite. BB is way less obtuse in it's interface than the constantly changing Android one. Android and it's apps are like a hieroglyphic tile puzzle that keeps getting shuffled with every update. Try teaching a tech illiterate parent how to operate Android, I dare you. - Neither of those really have a distinct advantage over the other. But it's nice to have options all the same. - See previous opinion on apps Not trying to slam you or anything, just giving my take. I think we need more options in the marketplace, not less. That's really my main gripe. But I know that's a fantasy because people generally gravitate towards a duality, so for now we're stuck with iOS and Android until some paradigm shift occurs. Francois Nguyen My responses to your responses lol: - it's not a widespread issue; it's not surprising a lot of people didn't know about it - that 1 % of good and varied apps is what everyone I know (tech illiterate or not) makes the switch to iOS or Android so I wouldn't ignore that - I agree with you on your statement. Most consumers disagree on this, though... My friends ABSOLUTELY need to tell the world what they eat for supper and what they read when they're in the bathroom, for example. - Most people that tried my BB Q10 or any Z10 in kiosk ABSOLUTELY disagree with your statement. They're all biased towards iOS or Android, I know (me too, BTW). But that's how sad the situation is when BB got too late to the consumer market. There's no incentive to switch OS. About teaching Android to a tech illiterate, I always did that to several 65+ years people in my neighborhood who never touched a PC in their daily life because it's too complicated for them. In short, BB OS = complicated, Android = easy, iOS = too easy. YMMV. - That's not a big issue now for developers. It's gonna be an issue when most apps (garbage or not) require Kitkat or later. Lack of incentive for devs = lack of enthusiasm for the platform. Winston Compatibility =/= native support. android apps run TERRIBLY on BB10 Cinj To be fair, most Android apps run terribly on Android too. And you're really not missing anything if you're unable to run most of the schlock that infests the play store anyway. Metallinatus Android apps have Google Play Services on Android, which is essential for a hell load of apps to work.... DEVVVV Chen ruined BlackBerry HumbleButBlunt Looks like the stock market disagrees with you. Nate650 The answer is simple: it didn't sell well and the lack of an ecosystem. Being able to run Android apps is not the same as having access to Google Play. ecnjnr I hope Blackberry resolves the performance issues by launch, or I'm reconsidering my purchase. Thanks for the review Jordan Palmer You and me both. ToniCipriani ‚úìp«ù·¥â…ü·¥â…π«ù å I'm just curious if you guys ever got updates. Some other reviewers stated they got at least 3 updates after receiving the review unit. Jordan Palmer I received a single update after this review went live. So far, it has only fixed some of my cell connectivity issues. Nothing else. Suicide_Note Even if they do that, it's still a mediocre phone. ecnjnr I'm a fan of physical keyboards. This phone is a Moto Z Play with a slightly bigger battery, a newer version of Android, a better camera and a physical keyboard. That's worth $100 to me, but maybe not for you. freshprince_87 Moto Z Play has a bigger battery Nate650 Bigger by a whopping 5 mAh. Miku is Best Vocaloid You can wait for the Moto Mod that will have a physical keyboard. ToniCipriani ‚úìp«ù·¥â…ü·¥â…π«ù å If they do a portrait version that is. Martin Rios Dude it depends on the market... Yeah say that "virtual keyboards are better than physical keyboards, swipe, etc.) but there are some folks that are waiting for the rise (or maybe it's the hype) for these kind of devices. Also another point is this sentence >>> "people who use their phones more for communication rather than media consumption, people who are tired of having the same one as everyone else, people who are professionals and rely on their phone to get things done, and people who are looking for something durable that will last through a busy day" >>> I'M ONE OF THEM. I can give less than a f*ck about aesthetics, ceramic look and all that crap, what I want is to be able to comfortably reply my company emails, open docs, scan paperwork, take crisp photos on the field and not sweating the cold if the phone ever slips from my hand (which I doubt). Sure phone must pass through IT Dept to block lost of sh!t like social media but I have my personal phone for that. I'm hoping a OEM in the near future release a phone with nowadays hardware and inspired by a Nokia E7-00, by the way that's my company device (I rejected a trashy Samsung Grand Prime the company tried to make me use, instead I went to Ebay and got a cheap yet efficient Nokia with a horizontal keyboard, Symbian, a decent camera and EAS capabilities). Nate650 Yea, it's a big issue. I still experience performance issues on my Priv. The Priv would be such an amazing device if they address those issues, but it's already been over a year old and they haven't. Do employees even use their own phones? They have to know about these issues by now. Kawshik Ahmed Does the stock 'Blackberry Launcher' supports Android 7.1's 'Launcher Shortcuts' or you have to use a 3rd party launcher ?? Muzaffar I don't understand that BB named it KEYone instead of Mercury. Venice also looks promising at first but becomes flop latter. Nate650 The name is the least of their problems. The performance issues and price are more important. Muzaffar That's why it becomes a flop. paul4tA I skimmed most of the review and went straight to the performance, because if they haven't fixed that from the PRIV, nothing else matters. I love my physical keyboard and have actually come to appreciate some of the other features over time, but I don't think I can take another year of the terrible performance, waiting sometimes minutes for the software to catch up with me. Nate650 It's interesting that not all the reviews mentioned poor performance. That leads me to believe there is a particular culprit and that it's fixable. Jordan L 2 things: I need this on Verizon for one of my bosses, and where can I buy it? Jordan Palmer Updated the buy link. It's up in the specs. BB will be releasing a CDMA version sometime near the end of the month, I think. John Just hold off for 10 years or so until Blackberry's keyboard patents expire and we'll see it put to use by more competent manufacturers. HumbleButBlunt BB doesn't manufacture devices anymore. Cuvis They still hold the patents, and license them to TCL. ToniCipriani ‚úìp«ù·¥â…ü·¥â…π«ù å Probably earlier, when someone somewhere somehow leaks it China and other knockoff makers start building them. RickMLA Battery pull. Fixes everything. Francois Nguyen Battery is non-removable on the KEYone... ToniCipriani ‚úìp«ù·¥â…ü·¥â…π«ù å Hold the power button for 32 seconds = Battery Pull Reset. JL It¬¥s incredibly horrible! Dragos Lucian So Blackberry is starting to be like an ass itch, and I bet the majority doesn't like that feel. And while we're at it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rla7wt8wKGM djinn123 Just because you don't like PKB's it doesn't mean they aren't for someone else. I'm tired of hearing "who uses PKBs these days" or to that effect. If you can't understand why some people NEED it, then maybe you can just stfu? Stefan Seidel Is the keyboard touch sensitive like on the Priv? That's by far the most favourite feature on my Priv, and I'm sad everytime it doesn't work in an app. Also, as to add something useful to the physical versus virtual keyboard discussion: - multi-lingual virtual keyboards have only come up recently. I frequently write in different languages, and having to manually switch between them just doesn't work (especially when sometimes you insert a word from another language in the middle of a sentence) - I am a Sysadmin and every so often I do need to get in to some server from my phone. Doing that with a on-screen keyboard is nothing short of having a hot iron stamp on your forehead. Having the full screen AND quick and easy access to non-alphanumeric characters is such a huge plus that it would justify any price (if you need it for work/serious business). I agree that using Swype or Gboard with swiping is pretty darn good when it comes down to just blurting out some natural language. Anything beyond that is a pain. Hamilton Jimenez Vasquez I think physical keyboards are way better than touchscreen keyboards, but.... I wouldnt switch my large 5.7 and beautiful screen just to have a nicer keyboard, not in this world. Not sir. dabug91 So annoyed that this phone even exists. Blackberry needs to do the world a favor and permanently exit the smartphone business. They should have closed shop more than 6 years ago. Nate650 And how would that benefit you?

[Is This Real?] Google Calendar's web interface should be getting a redesign in Q4 2017 Rita El Khoury Follow View All Posts 2017/05/04 5:33am PDTMay 4, 2017 61 Plus 1 on G+ 92 Share on Facebook 59 Share on Twitter Total Shares212 Google News Videos Folks, it's happening. Alright, it's not happening right now, but it should be happening soon. What every Google Calendar user has wanted for years, what every Google user who dared venture in the dark and murky waters of calendar.google.com has clamored for, what every piece of common sense has predicted: Google Calendar's web interface is getting a revamp. According to this roadmap of G Suite features that has appeared in a presentation from Google's Cloud NEXT 2017 event, Google Calendar has a "redesign of web interface" planned for Q4 2017. If that is what it exactly says it should be, then we will finally have that brand spanking new Calendar UI on the web that we've been dreaming of and that we can only achieve with themes and extensions right now. Below, you will find the entire slide of G Suite's usability features roadmap ‚Äî check it out to see if there's something else planned that is interesting. I've also linked to the exact moment it shows up in the video of the "G Suite Product Roadmap ‚Äî 2017 and beyond" presentation. (The video is from the EMEA satellite event with Dennis DeMeyere presenting, but it should be the same presentation as the one in San Francisco.) Nothing in here says "Material Design" or "new and shiny and colorful and clean and modern," so we can't jump to conclusions just yet. But at least we have hope that at some point in Q4 2017, Google Calendar on the web will look less like the lost bastard child of a 2013 one-night stand.

Yes, please! F4LL0U7 More reminder functionality, and let me guess, it won't integrate with Google Now, Keep, Calendar, or Inbox reminders? Maybe they'll introduce a new Gmail Messenger while they're at it... F4LL0U7 (I do realize this is most likely adding the ability to create reminders for certain emails that you don't want to fall off your radar, which I fully support!) catalysto This is exactly what Inbox is designed for. F4LL0U7 Right, but some of us just can't get into the Inbox interface, and would still like reminders on our emails. Cesar Cardoso "Gmail - create reminders. Yes, please!" And PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE integrate with all the 70000 reminders on Google products. Even if it's more like "star on steriods", as F4LL0U7 speculates. The Swami i'd settle for something simple, like an actual usable recurring Tasks setup, instead of having to go out for other apps to integrate that functionality into Google Calendar (reminders are worthless to me for this). Unfortunately, Google puts in what Google wants, not what the customer wants. Geoff Johnson Since they love splitting one service into many, I wouldn't be surprised to see features stripped from Calendar and put into a separate app. Mark Curtis Another chat app. Midas Gordon-Farleigh With a bot that you can talk to to create an event. Leo Herzog Did you watch the video? That's literally a feature of their new Hangouts Chat product. Midas Gordon-Farleigh No, I didn't. Unfortunately, not being a GSuite user, I figured there probably wasn't much worth my time in that. That's a bit silly though. Sigh. Defenestratus I don't use calendar for work - but for my personal life it seems to work pretty well. Not sure what it is that people want out of a redesign. Sean Thomas that's the same for me but I only use the android app which is material already. if you go to the calendar website on desktop it's just kind of outdated compared to the app interface. Defenestratus Yeah I guess I can see that. I don't think the design ever really got in the way of my using the product though. The "Create Event" screen on the other hand... it needs some help. Suicide_Note My thoughts exactly. Dawid Kania Hi Rita! I can confirm that this redesign exists. What's even more interesting since yesterday I have access to it. (I'm a member of "New Google Calendar Web Trusted Tester Program" at my current company). We are a G Suite customer and have received invitations to join the trusted testers program on 26th of April. Nicholas Conrad Oops, just violated the trusted tester tos :/ Dawid Kania Hi Nicholas, Thanks for pointing that out. Not being aware of the tos doesn't mean I should assume there is none. My bad. Dan Well now I want to know what was said... Josh Flowers He said https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/72eaa756ce425ac019d0637e35838dcd5846e8e660c771d22950b13701f6eee4.jpg Nicholas Conrad I don't want a candy-coated calendar. Material design really does nothing for me, reminds me of: https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/68423836fc3bc7576ed6e12686edeaa2f4b35db5c9c05a508d014f98b01e0b32.jpg Marcellus1 Disappointed the roadmap doesn't include more on Docs. It didn't have enough features I need to switch from Word. Leo Herzog The only thing left for me is custom fonts. What else are you missing? Kevfromspace A Show ruler setting would be great Marcellus1 I need a lot more formatting options. Trevor Kinsie I really hope that the redesign changes nothing about the functionality. I love Google Calendars as it is, I know it's not the purdiest thing, but that really doesn't matter to me. Please google just give it a nice coat of paint and be done, if you can add features great! Just don't take anything away. Rita El Khoury I love most of Calendar as it is, but for goodness sake, make it easier to set up notifications when someone adds an event to a shared calendar. Right now, users have to manually (and in a not-so-clear way or place) turn on email notifications for shared calendar changes, and that's it. Emails... In 2017. Miles‚àôPrower I know folks who love Google Calendar for what it is. Me? I'm old enough to have spent years on Palm, then on Pocket PC and Windows Mobile -- with integrations to Office desktop. When I switched over to Android and Google Apps almost a decade ago, I was surprised at the utter shittiness of the user experience in Google's productivity tools. Since then, Android's versions of these tools has improved immensely, while Google's web-based tools have remained as shitty as day 1. And Calendar is by far the worst of them. Come on, it's 2017, and you still have to navigate to a whole new web page that displays an entry form, just to see the details/notes for an appointment? Alex I'd like to see improved support for the quick entry feature on the web. In the app, it will autocomplete locations after you type "at", assigning the full address to the location field of the event. This doesn't happen on the web, at the moment. I usually end up going in to the app to manually set the location, as it works better. mondeca Congrats on finally doing things that needed doing a long time ago? James Donut Anyone uses here gmail as a journal (past dates) rather than scheduler (future)??? Daniel It's about time! The web app looks like a website from a decade ago... 4Ui812 This one's for you Rita üòÅ https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/6e83fc9381904fe522d202244f0a29e30b87f3a4fe62d22351427aaaa3618cf6.jpg jwildman16 I've driven by there many times! Indian Hills, CO. bazsi44 A little bit of self ad maybe, but I waited too long for this, so I made a Material Redesign myself. :) You will need Stylish and Tampermonkey/Greasemonkey to use it though. http://balazsorban.com/google-calendar-web-material/ https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/ad239a2458b5009c1fa2637ba8d59dc2142593b759733b221e384075cf2fbd8e.png It may have some flows, as I updated it a long time ago. But It is still nicer than that we have now. aRvInD While design overhaul is needed, Mobile Calendar app while I daily use Only sync events/reminders only for past year! Why Google? We are using smartphone with GBs of storage these days. Giving the user with option to sync how history events need to be synced should be made..! Even now when storage is full to remaining 0%, it shows no space to save a small single SMS! Can't SMS memory reserve an MB space prior? Gonzales You'd think that Google loving the cloud there'd be plenty of room. I'm hoping this design carries over to the mobile app. I use that daily. Carson Saldanha Ink for Google's pretty good Anjo Cerde√±a üëÜ This, but I'm very biased. Diggle Link please? Carson Saldanha Just search for it in the Chrome Web Store Carson Saldanha It's an extension Ger PG Not really thrilled about this considering how the Contacts interface was "improved" some time ago... Winston Oh goody another way to add reminders is coming. Winston This will give me even more choices when adding a reminder, and cover so many use cases. Not confusing at all! /s EcE OMG!!!!!! https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/19c21de580767556b5152df546358399957f9b59b55dafd30cff4d3a2553ab38.gif Nope.jpeg This might have to do for now. https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/clean-google-calendar/magodclodecbbnbdfpmoehfdddkhlfmm Diego S. It seems to be the end of the world!! I use Ink for Google Services Chrome Extension Butterpillar They better add flairs like in mobile apps, otherwise I won't use it. Rita El Khoury Meta: What would happen if during the revamp, calendar.google.com went down and Google forgot it had scheduled a Calendar revamp on its own calendar? wicketr What if their "revamp" is to replace it like Allo replaced Hangouts missing tons of features for an entire year. Like it requires a new account type, and doesn't integrate with your existing gmail account /friends, and missing ability to create events, and lacks any synchronization to the cloud and your mobile device since all data is stored in a cookie on that specific PC. Rita El Khoury Funny, but if we're being serious, Google might mess with a lot of things, but Calendar isn't one of them. Part of the reason they haven't updated the UI until now, I think. JG But don't worry... At least we'll be able to add stickers and animated emoji to our calendar events... That's far more important than silly things like being able to access it from something other than just a single device. Berni Hargrove So the real story here is why doesn't Google publicly release product roadmaps for their other products. Mathew Michel Please Google, upgrade the design this time. It's been too long. HSidhu Reminders are coming to Gmail, now I know which one to choose from (Inbox or Gmail) :) Tks Rita mike shwilly Q4 2018 - Calendar redesign moves from G-Suite to public Cesar Cardoso "Calendar - discoverability of secondary calendars" About time, Google, about time! Urmil Shroff I cannot even believe. Hamilton Jimenez Vasquez Then please they should add more options for Repeat, like "Every last Friday of the Month" or "Every First Monday of the Month". PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE. Gary Oberbrunner First Monday works fine already. Don't think Last does though. sky417 Still no love for Google Finance? Leo Herzog What, you don't like Flash charts? Curt inb4 bricks all Nexus and Pixel devices when accessed via one of them. Patch 6 weeks later. Jimmy Roche The animal sacrifices have paid off, long live gcal Jordan L great, I can't wait to see what useful features they remove in order to make it look more modern. BlackHawkRider . I might be boring but I like the calendar the way it is....... jcopernicus Q4' 2017? LOL fijisiv But will there be stickers?!? RichiePR77 Finally!!! And also, Q1 '18 - Stories for Google Calendar YuCMi Why does this sort of thing take so long? I would really appreciate a serious answer. ilovetesla I just want to know how to add a simple birthday reminder without adding a fuckin contact to calendar Lynxy https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/721ef9bc8b0c6fdef24724ab6333642a56ceb31548dc7517e6876f0d99c33bef.png ilovetesla You are a god to me now , please can you elaborate so that i can pray for you daily Carson Saldanha Holy! Does "rich text in event notes" mean we could finally use bold, underline, italics, bullets, etc.? I'm dying for this feature. Richard Branches Gmail is another lost bastard child... Tyler Swindell There's always inbox.google.com. DragoCubed Wait a second. iOS gets a today widget? Why don't they just make the widgets on android better and support their own os more. I know Google is a service company, I know there are different teams but... rap Why do upgrades to Google Products make me nervous. it seems half the time they take away functionality.

The relatives assert that by allowing IS militants to spread propaganda freely on social media, the three companies provided "material support" to the group and enabled attacks such as the one in San Bernardino. "For years defendants have knowingly and recklessly provided the terrorist group ISIS with accounts to use its social networks as a tool for spreading extremist propaganda, raising funds and attracting new recruits," family members of Sierra Clayborn, Tin Nguyen and Nicholas Thalasinos charge in the32-page complaint, which was filed in US District Court in Los Angeles on Wednesday. "Without defendants Twitter, Facebook and Google (YouTube), the explosive growth of ISIS over the last few years into the most feared terrorist group in the world would not have been possible," the complaint said. Spokeswomen for Twitter and Google declined to comment on the lawsuit. Representatives for Facebook could not immediately be reached by Reuters for comment. Married couple Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik opened fire on a holiday gathering of Farook's co-workers at a government building in San Bernardino on 2 December 2015, killing 14 people and wounding 22 others. Farook, the 28-year-old, US-born son of Pakistani immigrants, and Malik, 29, a Pakistani native, died in a shootout with police four hours after the massacre. Authorities have said the couple was inspired by Islamist militants. At the time, the assault ranked as the deadliest attack by Islamist extremists on US soil since the September 11 attacks. In June 2016, an American-born gunman pledging allegiance to the leader of IS shot 49 people to death at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida, before he was killed by police. In December 2016 the families of three men killed at the nightclub sued Twitter, Google and Facebook in federal court on allegations similar to those in the California lawsuit. Federal law gives internet companies broad immunity from liability for content posted by their users. A number of lawsuits have been filed in recent years seeking to hold social media companies responsible for terror attacks, but none has advanced beyond the preliminary phases.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us AIY Projects launched by Google for do-it-yourself artificial intelligence By John Hoff - May 5, 2017 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter Google wants to help developers build better ways to interface with devices, and of course, proliferate the usage of Google Assistant, Google Things, and other Google projects in the process. With this, the mothership is launching a new initiative called AIY Projects ‚Äì and this project will include do-it-yourself artificial intelligence (AI) reference kits for developers. Google‚Äôs new AIY Projects is made specifically with developers in mind, so they can create their own AI, so to speak, and integrate it into their creations. To kick start the new initiative, Google will start by putting out a voice recognition kit that can be built and worked into other devices. This voice recognition kit is the first of its kind, and Google is planning to release other reference kits for devs to work with as AIY Projects move forward. The new voice kit ‚Äì and the other reference kits that will be released under AIY Projects ‚Äì won‚Äôt come fully assembled, devs will have to put these together. What Google does provide are a few examples of how the kit can be used. The voice kit can be used to incorporate the newly released Google Assistant SDK, or they can choose to go with Android Things if developers want their devices to access stuff via cloud services. To get your hands on the new voice reference kits, Google is selling them at Barnes & Noble retail stores in the US. Additionally Google has also started mailing out reference kits to all MagPi Magazine users as of today. Here‚Äôs a free PDF of the latest MagPi magazine, while you‚Äôre at it.

Tipsy Elves has taken on rival Ugly Christmas Sweater (UCS) over a Google advert sponsored by UCS which allegedly featured the ‚ÄòTipsy Elves‚Äô trademark. In a claim filed at the US District Court for the Southern District of California on Tuesday, May 2, Tipsy Elves said that in December 2016, UCS used Google AdWords to place ‚ÄòTipsy Elves‚Äô as the top and first two words of copy in an advert linked to its website. ‚ÄúDefendants thus not only used the ‚ÄòTipsy Elves‚Äô mark, but also featured it in blue letters above everything else in the advertisement at a much larger size than most of the other advertising copy,‚Äù said the claim. This meant that when ‚ÄòTipsy Elves‚Äô was searched for, a link to the UCS website allegedly appeared in the adverts on the search. ‚ÄúDefendants employed the keyword ‚Äòtipsy elves‚Äô within Google AdWords in order to ensure that the advertisement featuring the mark appeared alongside legitimate advertisements and links to the Tipsy Elves website,‚Äù it added. Tipsy Elves argued that this gave the public the false impression that clicking on the associated links would take them to the Tipsy Elves website. This is the second time that the two Christmas-themed clothing companies have clashed. In 2012, an out of court settlement was reached after UCS was issued with a cease-and-desist letter to stop infringing Tipsy Elves‚Äô copyright in its sweater designs, according to the suit. Tipsy Elves is seeking profits, destruction of infringing material, a preliminary injunction and a jury trial.¬† Join us for a¬†FREE webinar¬†- The¬†Halo¬†effect: walking the wilfulness tightrope - on May 16 Today‚Äôs top stories WTO upholds Australia‚Äôs plain packaging restrictions Street artist takes on British Airways in mural copyright dispute ‚ÄòKung Fu Panda‚Äô copyright suit ends with two-year prison term Fraser Clemens merges with Shumaker, Loop & Kendrick Michelman & Robinson adds partner in New York Did you enjoy reading this story?¬†Sign up to our free daily newsletters¬†and get stories like this sent straight to your inbox Tipsy Elves, Ugly Christmas Sweater, Google, Google Adwords, trademark, trademark infringement, Christmas, apparel Editor's Picks Most read From forum-shopping to the UPC: 10 IP issues to watch in 2017 SCOTUS cheerleading decision brings sigh of relief for fashion innovators Impression v Lexmark: SCOTUS questions patent exhaustion rules Procter & Gamble sues oral goods business for patent infringement USITC investigates LG over graphics patent claim Hashtag trademarking jumps 64% in one year, says CompuMark Street artist takes on British Airways in mural copyright dispute University of Tennessee sues Amazon and IBM for patent infringement Eagles sue Hotel California over TM infringement Jay-Z hit with baseball cap TM claims Sign up for the newsletter Newsletter Your email * Links Home News Directory About Contact Privacy Policy Terms of Use Terms of Subscription WIPR Newton Media Ltd Kingfisher House 21-23 Elmfield Road Bromley BR1 1LT United Kingdom Email:¬†info@newtonmedia.co.uk Follow @WorldIPReview Tweets by @WorldIPReview

Yesterday, thousands of people got email invitations from familiar contacts¬†to open a Google Doc. It was a phishing scam, one that Google has subsequently squelched. Most people were smart enough not to open it, but a tiny number of people fell for it. Why? Because they recognized the name at the top of the email and trusted them not to send them something malicious. Trust has become dangerous. That‚Äôs the takeaway from the next episode of National Geographic‚Äôs show about the cutting edge of science and technology.¬†Breakthrough: Cyber Terror comes out next Tuesday night at 10 PM ET. The show explores how technology facilitates terrorism by following two different threads. One of those threads explores how terrorists recruit online. The other thread explores how vulnerable modern institutions are to attack. That‚Äôs the one that grabbed us. ‚ÄúI can totally destroy your life in under the time that it takes to drink that latte at Starbucks,‚Äù Jayson Street says at the very beginning of the show. Street‚Äôs a white hat hacker, a former cop who now¬†lives a real life version of the film¬†Sneakers. Companies hire him to break into their stuff, prove their vulnerabilities and advise them about tightening up security after. In this episode, he and two hacker friends have been recruited to attempt to penetrate¬†Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale locations around Beirut. The show doesn‚Äôt make it completely clear what their charge is, but it seems as though they have simply need to prove¬†that vulnerabilities can be found in the bank‚Äôs branches. The show lets viewers in on parts of the planning process, and very early on they start talking about the feasibility of getting behind where the tellers are sitting. This seems striking. How can they be so confident that they can talk their way past the barriers marked ‚Äúemployees only‚Äù inside a bank branch? The most disconcerting piece of technology they show off is the WiFi Pineapple, from Hak5, which we have reported on before. Hak5‚Äôs founder, Darren Kitchen, joins the hacking team for its exploit. His device is able to scan an area and register all of the wifi addresses that users‚Äô mobile devices are searching for. It can then quickly and easily pretend to be any of those access points and executing¬†man-in-the-middle attacks¬†if they so desire. The attacker could then serve up a fake login page for a legitimate URL. If the user falls for it and enters their legitimate credentials, the attacker will then have a working login and password. This could be the victim‚Äôs Facebook page or their web login to an employer‚Äôs backend. This is why everyone should consider using something like Google Authenticator or Yubikey as a second factor when logging in to important websites (avoid text messages). But it turns out that Street‚Äôs most powerful hacking tool is his own self-confidence. He simply acts purposeful¬†inside the branches and tells employees that he‚Äôs a contractor with the bank doing computer maintenance work, promising to make their network run faster. To prove he got in, he¬†uses another piece of Hak5 technology, its USB Rubber Ducky. That device pretends to be a keyboard and a mouse, very quickly writing software onto¬†a computer and executing it. In this case, it only makes and saves a file that says, ‚ÄúHello, world.‚Äù ‚ÄúIf you want to talk about what all of this hacking is about, it‚Äôs about trust,‚Äù Kitchen says. ‚ÄúAnd trust, as we know, is so much easier to destroy‚Äîin an instant‚Äîthan it is to build.‚Äù Rather than spoil exactly what Street and Co. manage to do, we‚Äôll stop there. It‚Äôs¬†impressive. We don‚Äôt hear Street‚Äôs conversation with the bank exec at the end, but we see his client‚Äôs face. It‚Äôs fair to say he‚Äôs unsettled by how far the team got. The chief vulnerability that Street¬†exploits is peoples‚Äô good nature. We have to do something about that.

Is sexy WiFi a thing? I think it might be! Via eBay, YouShop & with a slight delay courtesy NZ Customs, my first Google WiFi kit arrived yesterday. Pre-destined for a client with a 5-person household, every last one of them fully equipped with bandwidth-draining devices - iPhone 6S & 7's, Galaxy S7's, PS4, XBox One, Nintendo thing, Surface 4, HP Folio, iMac, Galaxy Tab, smart TV's, Arlo video security & more. Their existing kit was a mess - Vodafone router & WiFi with $330 Netgear extender that, when loaded up with aforementioned data gobblers, would often & regularly crash the signal. To make matters worse, the house is split over 3 levels, the single phone jack is on the middle floor, bless the Chorus installer who did this. After struggling through various attempted solutions - oversize modems that look too much like an oversized angular cockroach with stupid expensive extenders & various configurations all of which returned very similar results, it was decided - "Stuff this, Megabyte, you sort it. I'll pay, you sort it & hurry up" So I did the eBay thing & waited impatiently - til yesterday. Installation was a breeze, the Google WiFi app knows what it's up to. 15-20 minutes in total, all done. It's been in place for 26 hours now, delivering smooth, rich connectivity for all. How do I know? First up - not one call. If there was an issue, I'd be told about it. & also, the app gives me remote admin control - I can check in & out silently, making sure everything is sweet - & it is. Highest attached device count so far - 12. Mesh networking had to come to domestic installs, the bandwidth requirement of high/average households brings traditional WiFi hardware to it's knees. And any system is only ever as good as the weakest part. Google are, according to Forbes Magazine, our second most-trusted brand. Google WiFi is a product that's going to substantiate that high ranking. It's early days yet but not one aspect of the entire process has been anything less than excellent. I'm going to try Ubiquiti's Amplifi mesh product too, but Google has set a high bar. lxsw20 1942 posts Uber Geek +1 received by user: 556 Subscriber ¬† Reply # 1776680 5-May-2017 22:48 4 people support this post Did you buy the US or the UK version?

IMHO Google home is one of the poorer solutions on the market right now because the remote AP's can't be cabled back via Ethernet unless they're daisy chained which is impossible in most setups. ¬† Wired AP's are, and always will be the best solution. The cost of doing this in many homes would be less than the cost of many of these mesh solutions. ¬† Mixing WiFi devices such as TV's that are normally only single stream devices can also brings a network to it's knees so TV's should always be cabled. If they can't be cabled and you're running 2x2 or 3x3 AP's you should invest in a 2x2 or 3x3 bridge to run the TV off to deliver the best possible network performance. ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† surfisup1000 2921 posts Uber Geek +1 received by user: 740 ¬† Reply # 1776830 6-May-2017 12:08 lxsw20: ¬† Did you buy the US or the UK version?

That would seem the best solution to me. Rather than using wifi for backhaul.¬† ¬† So would a mesh with wired backhaul offer better 'roaming' within the house? ie, your device will jump to the fastest signal..... As opposed to 'island' style access points dotted around the house? ¬† ¬† darylblake 736 posts Ultimate Geek +1 received by user: 188 Trusted ¬† Reply # 1776838 6-May-2017 12:24 I would still go with AP's which are wired in with ethernet rather than relying on a full blown wireless mesh. The more devices including AP's compounds the problem.¬† ¬† Also with a wireless mesh the overlap needs more xmit power. You want to make the network quieter using lower xmitting power rather than blasting it. Thats not to say the product is no good. I have not tested it. But unless each of these are cabled back to a switch, then its really only going to increase range a bit at the cost of throughput. ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† sbiddle 24805 posts Uber Geek +1 received by user: 4718 Moderator Trusted Biddle Corp Subscriber ¬† Reply # 1776843 6-May-2017 12:40 One person supports this post Whether you have wireless mesh or cabled APs makes no difference to roaming.

To have devices roam you need both access points and WiFi capable devices that support 802.11 k/r/v standards. ¬† That is not correct. ¬†The majority of SME wireless solutions don't support voice enterprise but you can roam between the access points. ¬†The issue is that the 802.11 standard specifies what a roam is from a wireless point of view but not how the distribution system should handle it. ¬†For this reason roaming between different wireless vendors commonly doesn't work. ¬† For people who don't know what 802.11k/r/v are: ¬† 802.11k (Radio Resource Measurement of Wireless LANs) 802.11r (Fast BSS Transition) 802.11v (IEEE 802.11 Wireless Network Management) The issue is that clients who don't support voice enterprise commonly cannot associate to a WLAN with it enabled. richms 19373 posts Uber Geek +1 received by user: 3365 Trusted Subscriber ¬† Reply # 1776871 6-May-2017 15:29 If they are wired back, then it is not a mesh. The mesh is the connection between AP's back to wired network. Most of these things dont really do a mesh anyway, they use one channel for connecting to another AP, and then use the other radio to serve clients on. ¬† The problem is consumer wifi APs will never kick devices off, no matter how crap the signal from them is. If they have a minimum speed or RSSI on them then silly cheap people would complain that they get disconnected all the time when at the other end of the house and that the router is junk and the other one that never does it is a better router.

By Aaron Brown Aaron Brown PUBLISHED: 09:31, Fri, May 5, 2017 | UPDATED: 09:44, Fri, May 5, 2017 GETTY ‚Ä¢ GOOGLEGoogle Maps silently removed its Apple Watch app a few weeks ago Google Maps removed its navigation app from the watchOS App Store a few weeks ago, and no-one really noticed. The watchOS Google Maps app was silently dropped a few weeks, according to a report by Apple Insider. But despite the sudden disappearance, there was no uproar from Apple Watch owners. Apple Insider speculates that most Apple Watch users were not the app, which explains why the removal went mostly unnoticed for so long. Speaking with technology blog The Verge, a spokesperson for Google confirmed the US search company has ditched the watchOS app. However the spokesperson confirmed Google wanted to return to the platform in the future. ‚ÄúWe removed Apple Watch support from our latest iOS release, but expect to support it again in the future.‚Äù Google street view's most embarrassing pictures Fri, October 26, 2012 The most embarrassing images from Google street view Play slideshow 1 of 10 Has this woman really just given birth on a Berlin pavement or is it a training exercise for UK midwives? Worst of all, Google Maps is not the only application to have disappeared from the Apple Watch App Store in recent weeks unnoticed. In the last few weeks, major apps including Amazon, eBay, TripAdvisor and US supermarket giant Target have all vanished from the watchOS App Store. Most of these companies echoed Google's sentiments. "There are a number of reasons we don‚Äôt think this is the right solution for our customers at this time," an Amazon spokesperson told¬†The Verge. "We are always trying new things and look forward to experimenting with wearable solutions in the future." GETTYGoogle quietly dropped its watchOS app, however it wants to support it at a later date By while development on the Apple Watch has stopped for now, Google has been hard at work on its smartphone applications. Following an update at the tail-end of last month, Google Maps is now able to mark the location of your vehicle as soon as you‚Äôve parked, marking an end to endless panicked treks around packed parking garages looking for your family sedan. To use the new tracker, simply open up the app and tap the blue dot that marks where you are in the world. This will bring up the option of ‚ÄúSave your parking‚Äù, which will then allow you to drop a pin called ‚ÄúYou parked here‚Äù. GOOGLEAndroid users will be able to set a pin to track exactly where they are parked Tapping on this label will then bring up a further card, which allows you to set a reminder to pay the parking meter, share your car's location, take a photo of the parking space, or make any further parking notes, such as which level of a multi-story you are on. The feature is even better on the iOS version of Google Maps, where users can take advantage of a feature originally used for Apple‚Äôs Maps app. If you‚Äôve connected your device to your car using USB or Bluetooth, Google Maps can automatically tag your car's location once your phone disconnects from the vehicle. The new feature is available now on both Android and iOS, all you need to do is update the app for free on the respective app store. Related articles Watch PORN online?

The move follows a separate agreement¬†with the tax authorities in the UK, where Google agreed last year to pay ¬£106m in back taxes. It is also currently engaging with authorities in France and Spain. The Italian settlement brings into sharp focus again, the amount of corporation tax paid by Google in Ireland where its Europe, Middle East and Africa HQ is registered and based. There are growing demands both at European Commission and individual government level to apportion Google‚Äôs tax payments to reflect where it makes its sales. This followed a criminal probe which alleged that Google booked some¬†‚Ç¨1bn of revenue generated in Italy in its Irish office between 2009 and 2013. "We have also begun the process of drawing up an agreement that will ensure Google pays the correct taxes in Italy in the future," the country's tax authority commented. In 2015, the last year for which accounts are available, Google Ireland generated sales to the value of ‚Ç¨22.6bn ‚Äì about a third of its total income that year ‚Äì but only paid ‚Ç¨48m in tax here.

Global Cities 30 index: Seattle's boom is about far more than Amazon Share Ryan Bennett I am an equity analyst at Schroders working from the New York office. Before joining Schroders I previously worked at Zelman & Associates, Barclays Capital and Lehman Brothers covering the REIT space for 10 years. I graduated from Georgetown University and am a CFA Charterholder. Related City Talk Schroders Talk The only question you need to ask yourself before investing in an ISA Seattle is becoming more and more popular with the tech giants, we explore why (Source: Getty) Ryan Bennett The Schroders Global Cities Index ranks the fastest growing urban economies in the world, focusing on the potential for property investment. Read more on the Global Cities Blog. On this post, we examine Seattle's success and its future prospects . Why Seattle? Sitting at no.25 in the Global Cities Index, we rate Seattle as a top global city for a number of reasons. It offers: A key tech hub Affordable cost of living Large and busy port Few cities can offer both world class technology companies and an affordable cost of living. Seattle is one of them, even growing more rapidly than California‚Äôs iconic Silicon Valley. On the Global Cities blog we focus on centres that people want to live and work in. Although it has its challenges, we believe Seattle is one of these. A growing technology hub Tech hubs such as San Francisco have seen slower job growth in recent years but Seattle has remained steady. It now boasts an unemployment rate of just 4%, one of the lowest in the country. For years, the city has been regarded as a two-trick pony: namely Amazon and Microsoft. But the presence of these tech giants has attracted its competitors. Google and Facebook now have a substantial presence while Apple has a smaller footprint in the city. The effect on real estate is clear. The chart below shows the total office space of Facebook, Google and Apple. Office vendors have clearly benefited, securing leases with companies with little credit risk. The emergence of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has also helped spur a life science presence. But with all that said, the city‚Äôs success is still heavily linked to Amazon. It occupies six million square feet of office space, but it has committed to raising this to 10 million square feet over the next few years, including the construction of three stunning ‚Äúbiosphere‚Äù buildings. The company currently has more than 8,000 Seattle-based jobs listed on its website. Mapped: The Schroders Global Cities 30 index - by region Seattle office space commitments Source: Colliers International Offering a lower cost of living Silicon Valley remains America‚Äôs tech capital, but more workers are being put off by its rising cost of living. Seattle, on the other hand, is offering a better balance of both. The below compares house prices for the property sub-markets of San Francisco (left) and Seattle (right) where the biggest firms are based. In many instances, prices in San Francisco are double that of Seattle. Source: Colliers International The challenges The city is not without its challenges, which prevents Seattle from featuring higher up on our Schroders Global Cities Index. While the tech sector‚Äôs strength is a positive, it is also a weakness. We prefer cities with well diversified economies so that one sector is able to pick up leases if there‚Äôs a downturn in another. One potential growth driver for the metro area should be Seattle‚Äôs port which can offer alternative employment. In 2015 the port merged operations with the port of Tacoma, Washington. It‚Äôs hoped that consolidation will keep both ports on the map of global trade routes and gain market share from the likes of Long Beach, the country‚Äôs largest port. It‚Äôs also fair to say that some of Seattle‚Äôs companies are becoming more than just tech firms themselves, reducing the impact of a tech downturn. Amazon for instance is piloting ‚ÄúAmazonGo‚Äù in downtown Seattle. This is a convenience store concept that allows shoppers to pick up goods from the shelf and walk out. The cost is automatically billed to a shopper‚Äôs Amazon Prime account. It is part of Amazon‚Äôs expansion into the lucrative grocery store market. Watch this video to learn more about ‚ÄúAmazonGo‚Äù Seattle also has a serious traffic problem. Last year TomTom ranked the city as second worst in the US for rush hour congestion. However, the city is making efforts to improve the situation. ‚ÄúSoundTransit‚Äù, a light rail line between metropolitan Seattle and Washington State, was opened last year. Nearly $1bn has also been committed for investment in rail and road in the next decade to help the city alleviate congestion. Our verdict We often talk about wanting to own companies that have buildings in cities where people want to continue to work and play. As the tech giants continue to add jobs, Seattle should continue to gain on markets with housing affordability issues like San Francisco. As ever, we keep a close eye on local Real Estate Investment Trusts and invest in opportunities that are appropriately priced.

The Tusome programme was introduced by the ministry of education in 2015. It aims at improving the reading skills and fluency in children in lower primary schools. The Tusome Early grade reading activity is a collaboration between the United States Agency for International Development (USAid) and United Kingdom‚Äôs Department for International Development (UKAid) to improve access to quality education in Kenya. ‚ÄúWe believe every student deserves access to quality education and recognise that technology can play a vital role in creating richer learning environments,‚Äù said Mr Murungi. Tusome utilises innovative data-based instructional improvement methods in reading and use of ICT integrated support through tablets. The tablets are installed with an openly licensed mobile platform (‚ÄúTangerine: Tutor‚Äù) designed by RTI International and optimised for low bandwidth use, ensuring access to curricula content even in rural parts of the country. ‚ÄúIn addition to funding, we connect our grantees to technical expertise from Google volunteers and tools and products that accelerate their progress,‚Äù Mr Murungi said. Education zones Mrs Leah Rotich, a director-general in the Ministry of Education, said the ministry has zoned the country into 1,150 educational zones with each zone manned by a Curriculum Support Officer (CSOs). ‚ÄúAll the CSOs have been trained and provided with tablets loaded with Tangerine: Tutor,‚Äù she said. The tablets have also been provided to the county directors of education, sub-county directors of education, the Teachers Service Commission, county directors and the Quality Assurance and Standards Field Staff. ‚ÄúThese tablets are loaded with instructional materials to help them manage, support and supervise the CSOs in their respective counties,‚Äù she said. Tusome‚Äôs Chief of Party, Salome Ong‚Äôele said as a platform that can be adapted to local curricula and context, Tangerine:Tutor is uniquely positioned to help governments and NGOs close the teacher skills gap.

Colombia ads are content recommendations, branded content and videos, which are displayed ‚Äì at least on TimesofIndia.com ‚Äì below the story content. Traditionally, this is a space that is occupied, for most publishers, by content-promoting ad networks like Taboola and Outbrain. So are Times Internet and Network18 no longer competing? There‚Äôs always been a bit of an ego involved between publishers, and they have typically competed, not collaborated. ‚ÄúLook, like with everybody, we work with people as partners and competition, ‚ÄúGulshan Verma, Chief Revenue Officer, Times Internet, told MediaNama. ‚ÄúJust like within Times Internet, I have a Times of India and I have an Economic Times, and Times of India has a large business section. At some¬†point it makes sense for them to work together, and at some point it makes sense for them to compete to give the best offer. The way I look at it, this is a market that is growing, and digital is getting money that is moving in from TV, Print and Radio. How do we work together to maximise the share of that? What we‚Äôve done with Colombia is beginning to show value. This is an example.‚Äù This reminds us of when¬†the Times of India‚Äôs pitched its print business versus digital and TV, effectively also pitching against its own digital business. Advertisement Does Colombia compete with the likes of Taboola and Outbrain? ‚ÄúOn Colombia we have a direct demand, and we have demand from Taboola, Google, from Facebook and other partners. The way we look at is, for publishers, it drives the most amount of yield, because these compete against each other. Pretty much 90% of the maximising of yield comes from the direct sales team. The other places, other people come and add value. In the US and UK, it doesn‚Äôt make sense for us to have a sales team, so we have partners who work with us,‚Äù says Verma. ‚ÄúDo some of the people who work with us as mediation partners go directly to publishers? Yes they do. Like Taboola. On the other hand, they also work with us as a source of demand and supply. Both are¬†competition, and both work together, and there is a big opportunity.‚Äù Colombia now has several Indian partners, though based on the limited list that Times Internet shared in the press release, Network18 is the first significantly large¬†publisher to sign up for the network. Others include comparatively¬†smaller players like Punjab Kesari, Sandesh, Dinakaran, Udayavani, The Tribune, India TV, Bartaman Patrika, Andhra Jyothy. The list of publishers on Colombia, Verma told MediaNama, is over a hundred, of which 60 are publishers external to the Times Internet suite of properties. With Google and Facebook dominating advertising in India, there is often little left for the rest. While Google doesn‚Äôt disclose its monthly active user base in India, Facebook as around 184 million, and both allow fairly granular¬†targeting. For publishers to get a slice of the advertising pie, this is what they‚Äôre competing with. With Colombia (and Times Global Partners), now aggregating a user base of 250 million user per month, Times Internet¬†has earned a seat at that table, serving ‚Äúpersonalized content and video recommendations in addition to branded content‚Äù to more than 9 billion native recommendations per month. Currently Colombia¬†is serving Native Ads, and had expanded the offering to include Native ‚Äúoutstream‚Äù video ads six months ago. Verma tells us it will include display advertising as well. From a product perspective, remember that Times Internet had announced last year that it plans to invest $100 million in Colombia, but had been fairly skittish about sharing details. Realtime bidding? If not Taboola and other publishers, does Colombia Audience Network then compete with the likes of GroupM‚Äôs Xaxis? Verma says that Colombia ‚Äúis not programmatic in terms of real-time bidding. There is a platform approach where you can log in and buy, and it‚Äôs doing well for us. It‚Äôs not realtime biding for us. It‚Äôs a direction that we want to work in. We‚Äôre exploring that. The big thing is that you can log in, open an account, and say I want to distribute my content, like you do with any content discovery platform, and also we user algorithm to optimise. It‚Äôs not a trading desk where you can buy across X and Y. We‚Äôre thinking about it we haven‚Äôt got there.‚Äù Note that there is little doubt of a shift of advertisers to programmatic ‚Äì as Google pointed out in its most recent earnings conference call ‚Äì and the issue for publishers, is that both mobile and programmatic advertising both carry a higher traffic acquisition cost (TAC). Privacy and data sharing The Colombia Audience Network has been launched by Times Internet in 2014, with the objective of allowing advertisers to target users on their own network, based on behavioral aspects forming an ‚Äúinterest graph‚Äù, such as the kind of music they listen to on Gaana, and whether they read finance report on Economic Times or gadget related content on Gizmodo India. You get the idea. Times Internet claims that Colombia ‚Äúreviews more than 4,000 data points‚Äù about users. Since publishers can be skittish about sharing user attribute data with other publishers (and oddly enough, not with Google or Facebook, which aren‚Äôt seen as traditional publishers), I asked Verma about whether data is shared between Network18 and Colombia. ‚ÄúWe comply with privacy across Indian, US and European privacy levels because users come from everywhere,‚Äù Verma said. ‚ÄúFrom a general perspective, from an insights perspective, we obviously know which users are clicking on which content recommendations because it‚Äôs organic, within our widget itself. Outside of that, there‚Äôs very little in terms of data and insights that we‚Äôll get on the page, to be frank. Because you know, everyone has an https server. Otherwise they wouldn‚Äôt work with us if they felt, y‚Äôknow, if there were any privacy issues. So, within that page and that widget which sits on a publisher, it could be Network18, it could be someone else, we‚Äôve obviously seen that user on our network, we‚Äôve seen what they‚Äôve read and clicked on. But as a user progresses across the Colombia network, from Network18 to, say, a Times Internet property, do user attributes on Network18 also help targeting users on Times Internet properties? ‚ÄúI think any time a user on any publisher on Colombia, will look at what we‚Äôve recommended to them before, we look at the response and we learn from that. We have a limit that says that if we show you a branded content piece more than five times and the user doesn‚Äôt respond to it, you‚Äôre not interested on it. Whether it is on Network18 or somewhere else, that‚Äôs okay. Within our widget we‚Äôre looking at it, but we¬†don‚Äôt look at the data the way you‚Äôre thinking about it,‚Äù says Verma. 00 Related #Advertising #Colombia Audience Network #Internet #Media #Network18 #Times Internet Related Times Internet plans to invest $100M in its ad network Colombia Did the expected ban on ecommerce discounts make CouponDunia add cashbacks to its model?

Google Maps‚Äô data is a mix of the company‚Äôs own mapping and crowd-sourced data such as live traffic updates. This made Map Maker‚Äôs independent service especially useful when the company could not find accurate map data providers. The company has instead merged its features with the Google Maps app itself, with the updated version making it easier for individual users to add as well¬†as edit the roads. Read: Google‚Äôs Imminent Map Maker Shutdown Opens Doors For Spammers To Quietly Sabotage Maps For Users ‚ÄúOne of the most requested features to bring to Google Maps from Map Maker is the ability to add and edit roads. Today we are launching the first part of a revamped editing flow in Google Maps targeting road segment editing,‚Äù the company said in a press release. The new option is now available to users of the Google Maps Android and iOS apps. According to Phone Arena, this might be the company‚Äôs first step in revamping the Google Maps user interface. Advanced users, known as the Level 5 Local Guides will be able to report issues on multiple roads in the Google Maps Android version. If you want to edit roads on Google Maps, here‚Äôs what you need to do: Open Google Maps on your desktop computer or the Google Maps app for Android Tap on ‚Äú=‚Äù to open the side menu Scroll down and click on ‚ÄúSend Feedback‚Äù Tap on ‚ÄúEdit the map‚Äù Tap the road segment you want to edit Tap ‚ÄúNext‚Äù Suggest the changes for the road you selected from the following options: Name Incorrectly drawn One-way/two-way Closed Private ¬† ¬† ¬†8. Tap ‚ÄúSend‚Äù The company says it is going to add even more features to the app in the future, including the ability to report a missing road, report issues with a route and report real-time closures as well as other events. If you haven‚Äôt received the feature in your app, you might need to go to the App Store or the Google Play Store and update the app. Read: Google Maps iOS App Update: Popular Times Feature Will Show Users When Locations Are Busiest Crowd sourcing map data is not the only source of information for Google Maps, the company is also investing in technologies such as deep learning to make its data more accurate. The company recently revealed it uses a technology called Ground Truth to automatically update business listings on Google Maps. The company has also been using machine learning to identify and blur faces on Google Maps. While Google‚Äôs exact plans for Google Maps are not yet known, the application is expected to get more accurate and detailed in the future. The company is expected to add some of the features of its more advanced Google Earth software into the app.¬† Related Stories These Apps Are No Longer Available For The Apple Watch Google Maps Save Your Parking Feature Now Live Join the Discussion Most Read Stay connected to the biggest stories unfolding in technology.

Here‚Äôs how. ¬†Machine learning will be slowly implemented in other mainstream applications as well to enhance the productivity of the human resource. You might have heard people saying a countless number of times that computers have revolutionised the life of humans. They have become an indispensable part of our lives 24x7. These days, with an improved internet penetration in the rural areas, the concept of a connected computer community has made co-working a lot easier. However, there are some activities in our lives that have to be done on the computer that takes away a valuable amount of time from our lives. For example, if you are working on a project, you have to spend some time on thinking about creating new ideas or concepts. Once the creative part has been done, you need to spend a considerable amount of time on putting down those ideas on paper. You have to type it, format the text, and worry about document compatibility with other computers and so on. Overall, it takes more time to arrange and organise the work than creating the idea or concept. Not only document formatting, even email management and expense reports are some of the life activities that affect the productivity at your workplace. Google refers to this as ‚Äúoverhead time‚Äù that relates to time spent on tasks that do not relate to any sort of creative output. Google‚Äôs research states that ‚Äúthe average worker spends only about 5% of his or her time actually coming up with the next big idea. The rest of our time is caught in the quicksand of formatting, tracking, analysis or other mundane tasks.‚Äù We talk highly of virtual assistants on mobile phones (Siri, Bixby, Google Assistant) that learn our habits over a period of time and help us in a big way over daily tasks. Basically, the assistants employ machine learning to do their jobs. Google has used this concept of machine learning and put it into its suite of apps, known to the world as G Suite. G Suite consists of Google Sheets, Docs, Gmail, Drive and Hangouts. Why has this been done? To enhance your productivity at your workplace. Google has implemented machine learning in Gmail at the basic level. When you open your Gmail account for the day, have you ever thought how the emails are sorted into different categories automatically? Well, that is machine learning doing its job for you. Previously, Gmail used a rule-based system, which meant that the anti-spam team would create new rules to match individual spam patterns. Now, the system generates rules through machine learning algorithms taking spam detection one step further. The system continuously regenerates the spam filters by learning which emails belong to the junk category. Another example of Google‚Äôs machine learning is their ‚ÄúSmart Reply‚Äù feature in ‚ÄúInbox by Gmail‚Äù app. The app uses machine learning to read the message and provide contextual replies for it. This helps in a major way in situations when you are on the move and have to reply to multiple messages within a shorter span of time. Similarly, the ‚ÄúExplore‚Äù feature in Docs, Slides and Sheets uses machine learning to eliminate time spent on mundane tasks, like tracking down documents or information on the web, reformatting presentations or performing calculations within spreadsheets. The ‚ÄúQuick Access‚Äù feature in Google Drive can predict files based on who you share files with frequently, when relevant meetings occur within your Calendar or if you tend to use files at certain times of the day. Machine learning will be slowly implemented in other mainstream applications as well to enhance the productivity of the human resource. It will go a long way to sort our lives and make it less complicated so as to let us invest our valuable time behind creative tasks.

Startups Games Makers Tech Games Hardware Software Features Women Blog Events How to Opinion Competitions Forum Press office Talk to us on Twitter Follow us on Facebook Join us on Google+ Subscribe with RSS By Brendyn Lotz on 5th May ¬∑ How to ¬∑ News How to tell the difference between a phishing website and a legitimate one Earlier this week the tech community had a nasty surprise arrive in their inbox. The surprise was a very convincing phishing attack that appeared to be a simple request to edit a document in Google Docs. What made the phishing attack so convincing is that the website wasn‚Äôt a traditional phish but rather one which leveraged Google‚Äôs OAuth authentication interface. OAuth is used by a number of sites to allow users to use their Google account as a login by granting the website certain permissions. This vector allowed the attacker to present users with a legitimate looking website which prompted them to grant access to an app called Google Docs. Note the app was simply called Google Docs and wasn‚Äôt actually Google Docs. The app requested permission to view and manage your email and view and manage files in your Google Drive. Simply put, unbridled access to your Google account. Advert Google was able to close off the app‚Äôs OAuth access before too much harm was done but this attack shows us something incredibly worrying ‚Äì cybercriminals are getting smarter by the day. For that reason it‚Äôs important to know how to spot a fake website that could be trying to execute a phishing attack. My name is URL The first port of call for anybody trying to spot a phishing attack is to check the URL. Often a phishing website will look like a legitimate website but the URL is either a variation of the proper one or a different URL altogether. For instance www.website.co.za is legitimate but www.w.website.za isn‚Äôt even though they look incredibly similar. There are of course variations on this such as mail.google.com and it‚Äôs up to you to become familiar with the URLs of the websites you visit most often. Now while phishing often relies on you keying in credentials as we saw with the Google Docs attack sometimes just clicking a link can cause trouble. For that reason Denis Makrushin a senior security researcher at Kaspersky Lab offers another way to spot a potentially malicious URL before you click it. Advert ‚ÄúAlways check the link before clicking on it to access the site. Hover over it to preview the URL, and look carefully for any sort of misspelling or other irregularities in the name,‚Äù Makrushin tells us. One of these things is not like the others The security researcher goes on to tell us that should you accidentally click a phishing link there are ways to tell if the website is legitimate or not. ‚ÄúSome cybercriminals do not have the funds available to imitate/create websites that are very similar to original websites so they create a number of generic sites at once and upload them online with any domain name that they think would get picked up,‚Äù says Makrushin. For this reason you should give the site a once over looking for oddities such as the font being different or other peculiarities. Should you come across a website that is copying a legitimate one be sure to contact the legitimate website to inform the webmaster. Advert Be a password chameleon Another way to thwart would-be cybercriminals is to regularly change your passwords. The security researcher suggests changing your password at least once per quarter and making sure that they‚Äôre secure. We suggest using a password manager such as LastPass which allows you to store and manage your passwords (including changing them at a click of a button) while only needing to remember one master password. There are a number of password managers available so we suggest shopping around and finding one that suits you. A number of us here at htxt.africa use LastPass which is why we suggest¬†it. A healthy dose of suspicion Unfortunately prevention is better than cure and preventing yourself from being a victim of phishing means being suspicious. This doesn‚Äôt mean you need to treat every email from colleagues as suspicous but you should take some precautions. For one, should you receive an email from a third-party that contains links be sure to hover over the link to check the target URL. ‚ÄúDo not open links and attachments in emails received from a third party, even if they seem to be from employees of well-known organisations. If necessary, to make sure that an email is really from the organisation it claims, you should double-check that all of the links in the email are affiliated with the organisation,‚Äù warns¬†Makrushin. Finally where possible two-factor authentication should be enabled. The most important thing to remember when trying to be safer online is that as long as you are aware of your surroundings you should be fine. That having been said there is no way to insure that you are 100% safe from cybercriminals but you can make the job of ruining your day just a bit harder. ¬† [Image ‚Äì CC BY ND 2.0 Ilkka Jukarainen] Like this story?

[Hands-on] Google's Family Link is a surprisingly polished experience Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/03/16 12:26pm PDTMar 16, 2017 52 Plus 1 on G+ 258 Share on Facebook 72 Share on Twitter Total Shares382 Applications Google News Google has come up with a way to create Google accounts for kids under age 13, which has long been against the rules based on government regulations. However, Family Link allows for a very limited account with powerful parental controls. What's it like to use? It just so happens we've got like a million screenshots of it. Check them out below. The setup process starts on your device using the Family Link app. Here's what it looks like. Up to here, all you're doing is configuring the account on your phone. Now, it's time to grab the phone your offspring will use. This is what it looks like when you sign in with a kid's account. Note, you get to choose which pre-installed apps are included. ¬†¬† This is were some of the limits imposed on under-13 accounts become clear. Not all apps are available. For example, YouTube, Android Pay, and Google+. In the case of Pay, I don't think anyone will care. No YouTube is a little weird. I guess it's YouTube Kids only? The setup process is very clear when you're done on the child's phone and it's ready to be handed over. This is what you see on the child's phone after the link is established. Okay, back over to the parental device, the app alerts you when setup is done and offers the option to customize a bit. Installing apps is one of the first thing your kid is likely to do, and you have veto power. They will see a popup¬†when app installs are initiated. They have the option of having you type in your password to allow it, or they can push a message to ask for permission. Additionally, Google Play Games doesn't work. Here's what it looks like on the kid's phone. If your kid opts to send a message to ask for permission, this is what it looks like on your phone. General management of the account is handled in your Family Link app. You can control app permissions, set the screen lock, and find the device's location. There's also that neat bedtime feature, which can remote lock the child's device instantly. Importantly, this account can only be used on the associated Android device. That means no desktop access to Gmail, the Play Store, and so on. That's probably necessary to make Family Link compliant with federal rules for under-13 kids. Here's what Family Link time limit settings look like when managing the account. Going over the the child's device, this is what happens when a screen lock is activated. The parent device (below) can also control content on the kid device, including app sideloading, blocking adult content in Chrome, and setting rating limits for Play Store stuff. The app also offers a quick overview of what your child has been up to, including location information. This is what it looks like on your device. Here's what that same screen looks like on the child's device. ¬† Overall, Google is off to a good start. It is a bummer that this account only works on the authorized phone, but it makes sense from a regulatory perspective‚Äîit has to be tightly controlled. Sadly, that means no web access and no Chromebooks. Maybe in the future Google will be able to build the necessary controls into Chrome. A big sticking point right now is the requirement that you have a Nougat phone for the kid. That'll be less problematic as time goes on and more budget devices with Nougat ship.

Luciano It sucks that they can't use devices without Nougat. I like to get throw-away Moto G style devices for kids, and those, along with their kindle fire devices are all on MM. Does this work on devices with custom ROMs? Paul_Werner Yes it does h4rr4r This is great. For young kids it will protect them, older kids will learn how to flash another system image. Perfect! Suicide_Note And when the parents see no activity, they'll know Junior was being a sneaky douche and take away his phone. h4rr4r Those are some terrible parents. Dan What does that even mean? Who is terrible and why? The parents that monitor their children's electronics? Or the ones that take them away for lying and not following the rules? h4rr4r Who said anything about lying? You have an active imagination. I fully expect, heck hope, my son does something like that. I would be disappointed otherwise. If you give a kid a computer, which is what these things are, the the rules are what you can enforce. If your wifi lets me join then I am allowed to join. Dan So a parent shouldn't enforce rules for their children? Am I allowed to punish them for stealing something? Or should I admonish the store owner for not tying things down? Sergei the the rules are what you can enforce. The fuck is wrong with you? Following your twisted logic, I should also be allowed to do lots of things like running red lights, abusing free stuff giveaways to resell them, or littering around the city just because those rules aren't enforced enough. Seriously, what kind of scumbag human being only respects rules because they can be enforced? We should all aspire to respect rules because we understand and respect their underlying reasons to be there, and if we don't, we should also do something about them to remove them. But breaking them is by far NOT the way to go around demonstrating that they are useless. I really hope your kid doesn't get in some serious trouble by following your retarded logic, just because he broke some serious rules just because nobody could enforce them at the time. h4rr4r Wow, by taking words out of context you can totally change what was said. You should alert the media to this new method of making shit up you found. Ben Bayes Haha. But it's only a temporary measure. The parents might notice when usage statistics drop to zero. h4rr4r That is why you would have backups, swap back and forth. Sergei That would still be temporary, since you would need to unlock and unlock the bootloader, something easily detectable which wipes data. The parent would note near instantly what happened. h4rr4r You don't keep the backups local. Why would the bootloader be locked, good parents don't buy their kids crippled computers. Bob In some sense yes but hello helicopter parenting... h4rr4r My kid is 3, some level of supervision is a good idea. By 12 I would expect him to be able to pwn any device he has physical access to. Justin W Two things - 1) I think this is great. It will simplify the kid setup process significantly. My niece and nephew both got Nexus 7 2013s, and I ended up manually disabling pretty much everything they shouldn't have access to, but this appears to catch that use case and also eliminate almost anything else I can think of. 2) I wonder how the 13th birthday actually looks on a device controlled by Family Link. Is it truly an opt-out where the Family Link app is uninstalled, or is it a soft opt-out where they no longer are limited in what they can look at, but are still tracked by their location, settings, etc.? Killa What I want to know is when will I be able to bring my kids "already existing" account into this? RyanWhitwam Probably never. Those accounts technically should not have been created because you had to be 13 or older to have an account before. Doakie Yeah well I reserved my three daughters Gmail accounts when they were born because I wanted to be able to reserve their name. I lied about their birth year just to make it work. Simps I did the same. My first daughter is 4 next month and the other one is 4 months old. We are cool dads lol Jack Smith I did the same but domain names many years ago. Suicide_Note They won't work with Family Link then, unfortunately. Simps oh bugger. Foiled again Matt Yeah, my nephew was stoked a few years ago when his parents gave him that Hotmail account. Jack Smith Hotmail? My kids would not have accepted. They are sheep and you get a gmail account. Use Spotify. etc. Matt It was a joke. Since lots of time passes between creating and them using it, and 10 years ago... forget it Jack Smith Gotcha! I am slow with these type of things Matt No problem. I'm probably not the best at jokes, so I'm sure that didn't help. thespacecowboy I think many of us did this. Heck, for a few months I sent messages to that account each day after he was born so he can read them when he's old enough. Tim Ward There was an ad for google where this type of activity (creating accounts for newborns) was pretty much encouraged: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4vkVHijdQk Josh Crumley This looks very well made. Now if only they could put this level of effort into other Google apps we'd be set. ilovetesla gods at google really must workk their magic to make this app accessible for lower andriods ilovetesla mathew uses NEXUS 6??? damn Artem Russakovskii It was just a test device I used to set it up on. He's 4, he doesn't have a device. ilovetesla i guessed it was a test device , but still a nexus 6 .. b00sted my 6yr old and 1yr old share custody of my old Nexus 6. Jordan They could share sleeping space on one of those things. JD Don't worry give it time. Google will slip in some inappropriate adult ads in your child's Assistant requests in the next update. They have be consistent, with their inconsistency. Suicide_Note Going to factory reset and then set my wife's phone up as a kid's device tonight. Hilarity will ensue. https://media.giphy.com/media/OdHeYw7XBk6EE/giphy.gif Saxphile Username checks out Artem Russakovskii Don't even reset, just set it up for a new user on the device. That's what I did for this post. She probably would have no idea how to switch users anyway. br_hermon So to be totally clear here. We could fully implement this via a second user account on our phone/tablet to really create the optimal child protected device? It seems to me if that's the case, combining the two setups is the new default way to go. Artem Russakovskii Yeah, I think that's the way to go. resource Still can't access. Sniff sniff instinct I can't wait to see kids flashing the system to get around this. My parent set me up as a restricted user in the AOL days. What does a good kid do? Download a keylogger to find their parents password and change it in their settings. Dan I'm sure there is a way around it but I'm sure if the app controls sideloading then it probably prevents enabling USB debugging which would make unlocking the bootloader quite difficult. Sergei I feel sorry for kids with tech sawvy parents that truly know how to lock down a PC (disabling executable program access, enforce site and PC activity monitoring via screenshots, and disable important windows features like Control Panel, the registry, the terminal, and the task manager) Maxr1998 My parents sometimes changed the password of my Ubuntu account back then. I "fixed" that by booting a live CD, logging in as root, and copying over the salted password from my mothers account (which I knew) to my account in the /etc/shadow üòú Bruce Wayne Any regular kid will figure out a bypass around this rather quickly. Dn Bro Give it time. Google does have the ability to lock things down well. Have you ever used Chrome OS on a school managed device. Those are basically impenetrable. I'm an admin manager at our school. I know they are super locked down. teddyfrozevelt G Suite's forced admin settings (I also have experience with G Suite for Education) are really solid. I've never found away around the forced settings or extensions. Jack Smith Not so convinced. Google is pretty good at security. George Google's Family Link is a surprisingly polished experience... until your 'Backup and Sync' function stops working... Anton Kuznetsov Nexus 6! Mmm, great choice for the kid! At least he could use it as a shield when Google will send him Kit-Kat OTA. thespacecowboy No YouTube? Love it. My kids would never use their phones. Rusty Millabas ever heard of youtube kids ? thespacecowboy Ever heard of 12 year olds...? Chahk Noir Daily time limits? App download approval? Please please please bring this to Chrome OS! Jack Smith Yes ChromeOS support is a ntaural for this. jeremylea Hopefully this is better than Google Classroom... I was able to set up a complete profile on my Nexus 7 2013 for my daughter (9), using her Google Classroom login. Seemed like full Google access. I think I might request this so I can set the kids up with the Nexus - wonder if it will work with the mutli-user feature... Dn Bro Google Classroom is part of the Google Suite for education. It is a full fledged Google account. They can be used to setup devices because of that. Joe Kovacs This looks GREAT and I'm hoping that it matures quickly, but the Nougat requirement is kind of deal breaker. From my experience, most parents give kids hand-me-down phones or lower end phones because... well... because they're kids for heaven's sake. I'm still seeing low end phones selling with Lollipop or even Jellybean, and those phones aren't likely to get updated. So unless that requirement changes it's not likely to do most parents any good for a couple of more years when Pudding or Quisp make their debut. Captain_Invisible I agree, but I'm certain they wouldn't be able to do this pre-Nougat and it's not just a made up requirement. Dn Bro That's true, but if it was truly a software requirement, better to get it up and going now so that in a few years it will be common. Of course this is assuming Google continues supporting their product... matt0815 It's about time Google comes up with a decent parental control app... Dn Bro This looks great! I am a teacher of Junior High kids and it shocking to me (and I'll let their parents know this with nothing ever changing) when I here kids talking about facetiming people they don't know at 1 or 2 in the morning because they can and it's when their parents don't know. I especially like that timing feature. Being able to deactivate essentially a phone at bedtime is HUGE! Great work Google! joe everything is amazing until the kid signs out from his account on the device. & POOF SMH Marcelove Another genius move from Google: sell the info from kids with parents approval... Ok, someone will say that can't till 13 years, but obviously Google will store everything and when the kid turns 13 it will use all the info collected... And it is genius because, beside having the parents approval, it creates to parents the false illusion that the device he/she will use will be more secure...But actually, it won't ( if the kid wanna access something not allowed, he/she will no matter what) So Google will be praised by parents without providing any real value and as a bonus will collect and store all info from infants that will create a great buyer profile when he/she turns 13.

Google releases official statement on widespread Google Docs phishing email Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/03 3:05pm PDTMay 3, 2017 29 Plus 1 on G+ 128 Share on Facebook 75 Share on Twitter Total Shares232 Google News Phishing emails are annoying and potentially dangerous, but very rarely do we see one as nefarious as this. A specific email, shown above, has been making waves in the news and Google has released an official statement regarding it. You may be wondering why this specific message is worth talking about. Well, it looks identical to normal Google Docs invitation emails. When the 'Open in Docs' link is clicked, the user is asked to give "Google Docs" access to their Google account. Essentially, someone made a web app that identifies itself as Google Docs, easily tricking anyone not paying close attention. @zeynep Just got this as well. Super sophisticated. pic.twitter.com/l6c1ljSFIX ‚Äî Zach Latta (@zachlatta) May 3, 2017 Not too long ago, the official Twitter account for Gmail sent the below tweet: We are investigating a phishing email that appears as Google Docs. We encourage you to not click through, & report as phishing within Gmail. ‚Äî Gmail (@gmail) May 3, 2017 Shortly afterwards, the Google Docs account tweeted an official statement from the company: (1 of 3) Official Google Statement on Phishing Email: We have taken action to protect users against an email impersonating Google Docs... ‚Äî Google Docs (@googledocs) May 3, 2017 (2 of 3) & have disabled offending accounts. We‚Äôve removed the fake pages, pushed updates through Safe Browsing, and our abuse team... ‚Äî Google Docs (@googledocs) May 3, 2017 (3 of 3) is working to prevent this kind of spoofing from happening again. We encourage users to report phishing emails in Gmail. ‚Äî Google Docs (@googledocs) May 3, 2017 So there you have it - Google has mostly rectified the problem. If you see the phishing email, or something like it, be sure to report it so Google can more reliably block it.¬†Let us know in the comments if you received the email.

Sruly J https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHNczNvOnGc creep_the_night Yeah. Unfortunately it's been relegated to just Wi-Fi use at home till I'm able to fix the charging port... Demitrius Harris I love my HTC One M8 for Windows but it overheats easily. Does the Android version overheat quickly when playing 3D games. Not the usual overheating but severe‚Äã overheating, so much so that one time it overheated, melted the glue on that held the HTC letters and the letters fell off the back of the phone. True story. creep_the_night The Android version doesn't get quite that hot, but it does heat up pretty well. (At least I've never gotten it that hot) I also have a LG G3 VS985 that gets just as hot, if not hotter.(I've had the G3 actually shut down due to overheating) It's just the way the chipset is... Demitrius Harris Wow. Thanks for the info. MadMartigan pfft. Everyone knows the M7 is where it's really at. ASYOUTHIA‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà Report it to Google for phishing tim242 Done!

This isn't a screw up by Google, they fixed the problem right after they were notified. This is a triumph by Google, if anything. Martin How is this a Google screw up?

Zsolt V Moron, nobody is complaining about your reading, but about your trolling and idiotic posts. Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà I quote, "Why are you even here reading AP?" If you don't like my comments, block me, get some crayons and a coloring book, go to your safe space and wear a safety pin. Zsolt V Nah, I love calling out morons like you. Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà And I like calling out Google fanboy morons like you. So we're here for the same kind of fun, just on different sides.

The settlement will end an ongoing criminal investigation. According to the Financial Times, the sum compensates Italy for Google‚Äôs ‚Äúunderpayment‚Äù from 2002 to 2006 and 2009 to 2015. That is significantly more than the ‚Ç¨150 million Google paid the U.K in 2016. France is not interested in a deal. The French Finance Minister, Michel Sapin, says France must take Google to court and he expects to recover ‚Ç¨1.6bn¬†in unpaid taxes. Google‚Äôs parent company, Alphabet, is one among many tech companies accused of using ¬†tax avoidance tactics by registering their revenues from other EU member states in Ireland, Luxembourg, or taking advantage of zero interest on so-called ‚Äúintellectual property‚Äù rights in the Netherlands. In this case, Google is accused of booking around ‚Ç¨1bn of Italian revenues from Italy to Ireland. In a similar deal, Italy was also able to squeeze ‚Ç¨318 million out of Apple in 2015. The European Commission has accused Ireland of helping Apple to reduce its tax burden and has instructed the multinational to pay back¬†‚Ç¨13bn.

Name: Subject: Message: Samsung Chromebook Pro delayed, Android apps for Chrome to blame? Newsby Scott Adam Gordon21 hours ago 7 156 42 Google announced plans to release Android apps for Chrome OS at Google I/O last year, but until now they‚Äôve been in beta. The apps were expected to roll out fully along with the introduction of the new Chromebook Pro from Samsung in April, though that‚Äôs still not here yet either. Speaking to The Verge, a Samsung spokesperson has now confirmed that the Chromebook Pro will be available ‚Äúlater this spring,‚Äù which means it should be here in the next six weeks or so. But we‚Äôre still left to wonder about the Chrome OS apps. It‚Äôs possible that the delay of the Chromebook Pro isn‚Äôt actually related to the apps situation, however it seems likely that Google would want to announce the official launch of Android apps on Chrome OS¬†alongside some fresh new hardware, in much the same way as it does with new Android versions and the Pixels. In that scenario, it could mean that either Samsung or Google is responsible for¬†the delay to the other‚Äôs project. See also: AutoVoice Chrome extension for the PC now works with Google Assistant 3 days ago Given that the actual Chromebook Pro hardware was complete when we¬†reviewed it earlier this year¬†(save for a color change from silver to black), it‚Äôs possible that progress with the Chrome apps ‚Äî which were¬†far from finished at that time ‚Äî forced Samsung to postpone the hardware release. Once they leave beta and function like the Android versions, Chrome OS apps are going to provide a huge incentive for potential laptop/tablet buyers to invest in the Google platform. It‚Äôs just a shame we don‚Äôt know when that will be. Last we heard, the Samsung Chromebook Pro would go on sale for $549 ‚Äî would you be interested in picking one up? Let us know in the comments.

PHOTO | AFP ¬† Advertisement By FAITH NYAMAI More by this Author Google.org has¬†announced Sh200 Million (USD 2M) grant to support the use of technology in schools. The fund will be released to RTI International to help in improving learning outcomes amongst lower primary pupils in all public schools in Kenya through the Tusome Early Grade Reading programme. The grant is part of the Sh5 billion (USD 50 Million) commitment from Google.org which has been set to help close global education gaps. The grant will help improve the literacy skills of more than 6 million children in primary schools, in line with Tusome‚Äôs goal of building the capacity. The program aims to reach to over 100,000 Standard one two and three teachers, 1,300 Curriculum Support Officers, 67 instructional coaches supporting APBET institutions and over 300 senior education personnel. RTI International¬† in the next 12 months use the USD 2M grant to undertake enhancements on the Tangerine:Tutor Platform, procure and deploy the devices, mostly tablets. Speaking in Nairobi on Thursday, Google Manager for Policy, East Africa, and Michael Murungi said the grant will help RTI International meet the goal of the Tusome Early Grade Reading Activity. The Tusome program was introduced by the ministry of education in 2015. It aims at improving the reading skills and fluency in children in lower primary schools. The Tusome Early grade reading Activity is a collaboration between the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and United Kingdom‚Äôs Department for International Development (UKAID) to improve access to quality education in Kenya. ‚ÄúWe believe every student deserves access to quality education and recognize that technology can play a vital role in creating richer learning environments,‚Äù said Mr Murungi. Tusome utilizes innovative data-based instructional improvement methods in reading and use of ICT integrated support through tablets. The tablets are installed with an openly licensed mobile platform (‚ÄúTangerine: Tutor‚Äù) designed by RTI International and optimized for low bandwidth use, ensuring access to curricula content even in rural parts of the country. Over the last five year, Google has more than USD110M to help close gaps in education. Mr Murungi said ‚ÄúIn addition to funding, we connect our grantees to technical expertise from Google volunteers and tools and products that accelerate their progress,‚Äù Director-General in the Ministry of Education, Mrs Leah Rotich, said the Ministry has zoned the country into 1150 Educational zones with each zone manned by a Curriculum Support Officer (CSOs). ‚Äú All the CSOs have been trained and provided with tablets loaded with Tangerine: Tutor,‚Äù she said The Tablets have also been provided to the County Directors of Education, Sub-County Directors of Education, the Teachers Service Commission County Directors and the Quality Assurance and Standards Field Staff. ‚ÄúThese tablets are loaded with instructional materials to help them manage, support and supervise the CSOs in their respective counties.‚Äù¬† She said. Tusome‚Äôs Chief of Party, Salome Ong‚Äôele said as a platform that can be adapted to local curricula and context, Tangerine:Tutor is uniquely positioned to help governments and NGOs close the teacher skills gap. email print In the headlines Raila‚Äôs stand on independent candidates About 1,500 aspirants have been cleared to contest various seats as independent candidates.

Because the present is so divided and fractured, we doubt that a single vision of the future emerges. Or, we think, each of us is making a personal relationship with the present and therefore, once again, the future cannot be brought to single vision. Nevertheless, the present is also swollen with clearly observable elements, conditions, factors, dominating spins, modalities, platforms, priorities, determinants and what have you, as the Dude would say, that do not point to an infinitude of futures but rather to two. We are getting to know one of them very well because it arises from a kind of apocalyptic fear, fear that destruction lies ahead. The havoc we have created in our environment seems to have reached the mood of Frost‚Äôs poem, ‚ÄúFire and Ice‚Äù:Some say the world will end in fire/Some say in ice.¬† Our fears of the end, our eschatological fears, imagine nuclear missiles launched by madmen or nuclear suitcase bombs going off everywhere improvised by those who hate us. We finish ourselves before our ravaged planet does. Actually, in this scenario, we are fouling the nest of Nature by upsetting the fragile conditions by which all creatures survive. Global warming, if the predictions of science hold true, will also suffice for an ending to human life on Earth. Truth be told, empirically, rationally and, now, alternatively, our response to 9/11-like events has shrunk to our annoyance with the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) baggage checks. U.S. fears of global warming also shrink every year, even though the planet continues to heat up. Bret Stephens, in his launch op-ed piece for the NY Times, mocks certitude in anything, including climate change, reaching out in this to the three quarters of Americans who deny any consensus on climate change. (Stephens, ‚ÄúClimate of Complete Certainty,‚Äù April 28, 2017). And the matter of dealing with probabilities regarding Kim Jon Un‚Äôs launching a nuclear missile in our direction rests with President Trump. And so the present discloses only muddle here on these issues although the probability is high that global warming will wreak havoc and worse . Whether or not Americans become interested in this is not clear in the present. A likewise situation holds for the clarity of nuclear threat, especially because President Trump signals an ability to hold numerous contradictions in mind without awareness of doing so. The probability here is that either he will stop functioning in any manner that can be spun as rational, or the country will stop functioning. The present reveals more than these imponderable and dystopic scenarios and it may be that the best way to avoid these, and a reincarnation of Trump in the future, may be to focus on the future consequences of other observables in the present. If neither Nature nor madmen in high office and/or with nuclear armaments destroy us, what is the future we see in the present? I do not see a return to unions fighting for salaries and conditions of employment for workers. The mid-1950s when 35% of workers were unionized will not return. We also cannot envision that salaries will move from the debit side of the ledger to the credit side. Shareholders are not more liable in the future to vote for wage increases subtracted from their stock returns. Consumers in the future probably will not be more willing to pay more for anything in return for higher wages for workers supplying those goods and services. I cannot see that a weakened and disparaged class, namely, wage earners, will replace the public and private ownership of profit-seeking entities, i.e., the capitalist ownership of the means of production. The competitive temper of the American mass psyche is not toward a shared ownership among equals, toward worker owned cooperatives, but rather toward individual winning and losing. The Forgotten, namely those left out of a globalist competitive game, have mobilized themselves into national recognition through their advocacy of Donald Trump. Because he cannot keep them loyal, loot the country, increase their immiseration and blame Obama and Hillary, we can expect that in the near future The Forgotten will become something like the sans-culottes that stormed the Bastille. Trump will self-destruct but The Forgotten will remain, as will a plutocratic order that survives Trump‚Äôs autocratic rule. A portion of the wage earning class is scheduled to receive low wages from multiple ‚Äúgig‚Äù/‚Äùindependent contractor‚Äù sources on an unpredictable 24/7 basis. Another portion is scheduled for unemployment as robotics, AI, on-line venues, and health incapacities become the norm. This attrition of wage earners in the future due to robotics has no remedy, for no other reason than our American cultural imaginary gives hi-tech a blank check to do whatever it wants. Attrition created by replacing brick and mortar enterprises with digital, cyberspace enterprise is clearly unstoppable. 840,000 workers employed by GM: 38,000 by Google, though Google‚Äôs earning were 20% higher than GM, which means cyberspace generates more profit but not greater distribution of that profit to workers. We have never in the past extinguished any technological ‚Äúadvance,‚Äù even thought it has proven to be clearly a toxic or deadly advance, either in terms of the quality of human life or the health of the planet. Cyber companies like Google and Apple believe in this: ‚ÄúThe ability to learn faster than your competitors may be the only sustainable competitive advantage‚Äù (Arie de Geus) We see very little movement in the present toward this: ‚ÄúThe well being of both humans and the planet depends on the cooperative advance of what sustains both rather than the pursuit of a competitive advantage leading to every increasing profits to dividend recipients.‚Äù Such an improbable cooperative advance would be facilitated by the growth of worker owned cooperatives but, to repeat, any form of mutualism is believed widely to be an imposition on the individual competitive spirit, the assumption of personal responsibility and the rewards of personal winning. Perhaps most frightening in this improbable mutualism is the replacement of private property ownership and the inequities to which it leads with a socialist order in which, in the American cultural imaginary reigning in the present, we are all poor together. The case against worker owned cooperatives presumes that this is a political structure that will constrain and reduce personal freedom, the competitiveness that produces wealth, and the initiative that drives that competitiveness. A competition for private ownership results in a hierarchy of power that freely competing individuals accept as legitimate. This is both a theory and a spin, one that The Forgotten followers of Trump are at war with, not in regard to the dispensations of capitalist economic power but specifically in regard to the Federal government, not in the hands of an unqualified Trump but in the hands of Obama and the Clintons. Trump cannot let go his attacks on Obama because his followers continue to live on the fumes of that hatred. Pointing out that the inequities of wealth and power have long since corrupted the ‚Äúlevel playing field‚Äù of competitiveness has had little effect in the present. Pointing out that a plutocratic order is a powerful inhibitor of individual freedom has also made little headway in the present. There is scant reason to expect that either indictment will turn the tide. Donald Trump is clear evidence of what all the illiberalities of a plutocratic order can produce but none of this has been meaningful to his supporters, ironically most of whom are at the other end of plutocratic order production. There is then, in summary, no sign in the present that there will be any adherence in the future to the statement that the well being of both humans and the planet depends on the cooperative advance of what sustains both. There is a strong probability that we will continue the pursuit of a competitive advantage leading to every increasing profit to individuals positioned by stock ownership to enjoy those profits. Attrition for reason of incapacity of the waging earning class is an attrition that can be prevented. Nationalized medicine, which includes price controls regarding all health care costs as well as pharmaceuticals, has been strenuously challenged in the past and continues to be in the present in the U.S. If you consider the calculus of wage earner contribution to the economy, free access to health care would be an unwarranted expense. Under our system of seeking a competitive advantage, allocating profits, via taxes, toward a service that is irrelevant in the pursuit of that advantage makes no sense. The bottom line here is that if an economy is buzzing along nicely without this large segment of the population then the good or bad health of that segment is irrelevant. Tax payer supported universal health care is then a problem to the foundational ruling creed, that is Market Rule, that drives the totality of American culture, an economics that drives the politics as recognized and obeyed by both political parties. Poor health has in the present shown up in the surprising statistics regarding the rising death rate of middle age white wage earners as well as the fact that the U.S. has the lowest life expectancy at birth among OECD comparable countries. If this attrition of wage earners was restricted to whether we had a public or private health care system, we could be more optimistic regarding the future. However, wage earners are suffering from the rapaciousness of our economic system, both in its use of a toxifying business model and in the wealth inequities it produces. Consider that a serious wealth gap enables the top 20% to consume non-toxic food and drink while the remaining population is bottom feeding, fast foods and industrialized, chemicalized foodstuff. In order to break that calculus, you need to upend the Market‚Äôs profit priorities in regard to production and also in regard to the equity of results. There is no sign in the present that this can occur. So, wage earners, encompassing a notable percentage of The Forgotten, can be left out of the profit making equation, can indeed be forgotten, and the national economy can continue to hum along nicely. The success of the top 20% professional, dividend recipient class is the engine driving the economy and that success has a commensurate political success. You can have a thriving 20% democracy in the future in which free elections go on and the Bill of Rights is lively. You can have all this without needing some 80% of the population. Ironically and drastically, the public good and the general Welfare of ‚ÄúWe, the People‚Äù translates in the future to the preservation and protection of a dividend recipient class. And from that perspective, the majority becomes a problem to be solved. A former ‚Äúworking class hero‚Äù is now a vestigial member on the plutocratic body. Finland initiated a program in which 2,000 citizens are given a guaranteed income, the funds dispensed to both those who work or do not work. A universal income certainly offers security to wage earners who are no longer needed in a 20% ‚Äúdemocracy,‚Äù but more importantly to that 20% is the security they achieve when a threat is disarmed. Will a UBI, a universal basic income, materialize in the U.S. and thus stave off the threat that a ‚Äúcreatively destroyed‚Äù 80% will present to a winning 20%? Again, what is observable in the present in regard to any form of tax supported government welfare, which is what UBI would be, is a dominating belief that any interference by government in market rule‚Äôs dispensation of reward destroys and at best reduces incentive. This, like the matter of personal free choice, is a belief that cannot bear close examination. There is a strong continued effort in the present to convert all public funding to private control, which means returning the situation, whether retirement, health care, unemployment, disability and so on, to market rule. Therefore, it is doubtful that UBI will be activated in the U.S. Repealing Obamacare would release ¬†those with incomes of $1 million or more of a roughly $144 billion tax burden over the coming decade, according to a congressional analysis. Thus, the action continues to go away from tax supported programs that tax the wealthy and benefit everyone else. Finally, what we see in the present of what I would call a growing visitation from the Id as well as a collapse into a kind of solipsistic obliviousness reveal much of our future. It seems clear that cyberspace, despite the enthusiasm of cyberspace libertarians as well as the enthusiasm of marketers and advertisers, who are using Big Data to target everyone‚Äôs reachable spots, is a powerful soma delivery system. Cyberspace is more like Pandora‚Äôs Box dispersing not a thousand flowers to bloom but more of the dark side of the twisted branch of our humanity. Twitter alone proves the case. I recognize the enthusiasm for Google‚Äôs ready to hand responses to all our questions, the wonders of so much information at a click, but I wonder how clicking in the world of our own preferences within a system designed to respond to those preferences does not preempt any kind of learning. I reach this critique pre-digitally, a slow kind of analog erudition in which I recall this from John Dewey: ‚ÄúTo maintain the state of doubt and to carry on systematic and protracted inquiry ‚Äî these are the essentials of thinking,‚Äù And this from Susanne Langer: ‚ÄúThe way a question is asked limits and disposes the ways in which any answer to it ‚Äî right or wrong ‚Äî may be given.‚Äù What the present reveals in regard to learning are three indicators that tell us much of the future: 1. Learning is not a successful enterprise or even a fledgling start-up in the U.S.; 2. The uncertainties regarding how to both create and evaluate learning makes it a plunderable marketing frontier; 3. The confusion of learning with digitally retrieved information and the containment of that retrieval within the domain of previous choices leads to anti-learning or learning blockage. We not only then face in the future a kind of thinking that cannot break out of categories which have already led to the dystopic future I am describing but a kind of thinking that can reduce a populace within a plutocracy to an illusionary self-empowerment condition. It is not difficult to imagine that the domains of cyberspace and virtual reality will create a seduction that far exceeds what the Sirens offered Odysseus.

PHOTO: REUTERS Family members of three victims of the December 2015 shooting rampage in San Bernardino, California, have sued Facebook, Google and Twitter, claiming that the companies permitted Islamic State to flourish on social media. The relatives assert that by allowing Islamic State militants to spread propaganda freely on social media, the three companies provided ‚Äúmaterial support‚Äù to the group and enabled attacks such as the one in San Bernardino. ‚ÄúFor years defendants have knowingly and recklessly provided the terrorist group ISIS with accounts to use its social networks as a tool for spreading extremist propaganda, raising funds and attracting new recruits,‚Äù family members of Sierra Clayborn, Tin Nguyen and Nicholas Thalasinos charge in the 32-page complaint, which was filed in US District Court in Los Angeles on Wednesday. Trump accuses media of ignoring terrorist attacks ‚ÄúWithout defendants Twitter, Facebook and Google (YouTube), the explosive growth of ISIS over the last few years into the most feared terrorist group in the world would not have been possible,‚Äù the complaint said. Spokesperson for Twitter and Google declined to comment on the lawsuit. Representatives for Facebook could not immediately be reached by Reuters on Thursday afternoon. Syed Rizwan Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, opened fire on a holiday gathering of Farook‚Äôs co-workers at a government building in San Bernardino on December 2, 2015, killing 14 people and wounding 22 others. Farook, the 28-year-old, US-born son of Pakistani immigrants, and Malik, 29, a Pakistani native, died in a shootout with police four hours after the massacre. Hacker released tools FBI used to crack San Bernardino attacker‚Äôs iPhone online Authorities have said the couple was inspired by militants. At the time, the assault ranked as the deadliest attack by religious extremists on US soil since the September 11, 2001, attacks. In June 2016, an American-born gunman pledging allegiance to the leader of Islamic State shot 49 people to death at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida, before he was killed by police. In December 2016 the families of three men killed at the nightclub sued Twitter, Google and Facebook in federal court on allegations similar to those in the California lawsuit. Federal law gives internet companies broad immunity from liability for content posted by their users. A number of lawsuits have been filed in recent years seeking to hold social media companies responsible for terror attacks, but none has advanced beyond the preliminary phases.

Now that Android Wear¬†is becoming a more mature platform, mostly thanks to the long-awaited 2.0 update, we're starting to see more watches than ever hit the market. It was fairly easy to compare Android Wear watches in years past - only a handful of tech companies even bothered. But now, a vast amount of wearables are being released, with most of them by actual watch companies. So how do they all stack up? You may notice some missing information below, especially from Fossil. We tried multiple times to reach out to Fossil for information on its upcoming watches, but we didn't receive a response. At a glance We've compiled a massive table¬†comparing every watch.¬†You can also look at it on Google Docs.

It's definitely one of the most feature-packed watches on the market, supporting every feature the OS does. It works with¬†Wi-Fi, LTE, NFC, and GPS - and includes a heart rate sensor and a speaker. As far as specifications go, it has a Snapdragon Wear 2100 CPU, a 480x480 1.38" circular display, IP68 water resistance, and a 430mAh battery. Unfortunately, battery life isn't fantastic, especially if you need to use LTE often. Be sure to check out our full review for more details, and you can buy it now from various retailers for $349. LG Watch Style Just like the Watch Sport, this was developed by LG and Google as an Android Wear 2.0 launch device.¬†The Style is much thinner than the Sport, but at the cost of features and battery life. It lacks NFC, LTE, GPS, and a heart rate sensor. The battery capacity is just 240mAh, which should only get you through a day of use (if that). The Style has a Wear 2100 processor, a round 1.2" 360x360 display, and IP67 water resistance. You can find our full review here, and if you want to buy one for yourself, it will cost you $249. Casio Pro Trek WSD-F20 If you need a super rugged Android Wear device, the WSD-F20 may be for you. Casio announced the watch back in January, and it just recently went on sale for a whopping $500. For that price, you're getting a speaker, Wi-Fi and GPS connectivity, and a 1.32" 320x300 display. However,¬†the WSD-F20 is missing quite a few important features. It doesn't have a heart rate sensor, NFC, or LTE. Also, it is one of the few 2017 Android Wear watches with a flat tire display. New Balance RunIQ New Balance released its first Android Wear watch earlier this year, the RunIQ. As you might guess, the RunIQ is primarily designed for workouts. It's powered by an Intel Atom Z34XX processor and includes Wi-Fi and GPS connectivity, a 1.39" 400x400 circular display, a 410mAh battery, and 5ATM water resistance. Unfortunately, the RunIQ lacks NFC for Android Pay, as well as LTE connectivity and a speaker. It's currently priced at $299. Huawei Watch 2 Why, Huawei? You were the chosen one! After the original Huawei Watch ended up being one of the best Android Wear devices on the market, many were excited for a newer model. Unfortunately, what Huawei provided was subjectively worse than the original - you can find our full review here. If you're still interested, the Huawei Watch 2 has a 1.2" 390x390 circular display, a 420mAh battery, IP67 water resistance, and all the connectivity and sensors you could want (including LTE). It's currently on sale for around $299, depending on the retailer. Huawei Watch 2 Classic The 'Classic' variant of the Huawei Watch 2 is probably closer to what most people were hoping for. It has almost exactly the same specifications as the normal Watch 2 - a Wear 2100 CPU, 1.2" 390x390 display, 420mAh battery, IP67 water resistance. However, it lacks the Wear 2's LTE support. The Watch 2 Classic is also $70 more expensive than the normal model, and shares many of its faults - small screen, no digital crown, etc. It's currently priced at $369 at most retailers. TAG Heuer Connected Modular 45 The award for the longest smartwatch name goes to the TAG Heuer Connected Modular 45. This watch has¬†an Intel Atom Z34XX processor (the same one the Casio watch uses), 1.39" 400x400 circular display, 410mAh battery, and speaker. As far as connectivity and sensors, it has¬†Wi-Fi, GPS, and NFC for Android Pay. It does not have a heart rate sensor or LTE. The Connected Modular 45 also wins the award for most expensive smartwatch on this list - you'll be shelling out $1,650 for the privilege of owning one. Montblanc Summit Similar to the TAG Huer, the Montblanc Summit is another luxury smartwatch. It has a Snapdragon Wear 2100 CPU, 1.39" 400x400 circular display, heart rate sensor, 300mAh battery, and IP68 water resistance. Unfortunately, the Summit is a bit light on functionality. It doesn't have NFC, LTE, GPS, or a speaker. Whether¬†or not that matters is up to you, but I expect the $890 starting price will drive most normal people away. GUESS Connect (2017) GUESS has made hybrid smartwatches with dot-matrix displays in the past, but this year, the company¬†released a proper Android Wear watch. It's available in two sizes - a 41mm for women (left) and a 44mm for men (right). The GUESS Connect has¬†a Snapdragon Wear 2100 processor but lacks NFC, LTE, GPS, and a heart rate sensor. The watch is expected to be released in Fall or Winter 2017 and will start at $300. Michael Kors Access¬†Grayson/Sofie Michael Kors announced two very similar Android Wear watches earlier this year, the Access Grayson (left) and Access Sofie (right). The Grayson looks more like a traditional men's watch, with an AMOLED display and a digital crown. It will be available in gold, stainless steel, and blue/black. The Sofie is primarily targeted at women, with a thinner case and a lighter feel than the Grayson. It has the same AMOLED display, but sadly¬†lacks a digital crown. It will have eight plating/bracelet combinations and seven interchangeable strap options. Both watches have a Snapdragon Wear 2100 processor and will start at $350. Misfit Vapor There are plenty of expensive products¬†on this list, but if you're looking for a good value smartwatch, the Misfit Vapor might be the best choice. It's¬†the second-cheapest Android Wear device on this list, at just $199, but it has¬†a Wear 2100 processor, a 1.39" circular display, water resistance up to 50 meters, Wi-Fi, GPS, and a heart rate sensor. However, I was unable to find confirmation that the Vapor included a speaker. Design-wise, the Misfit Vapor is definitely one of my favorites. It has a similar design to the Moto 360, but with a small bezel surrounding the screen instead of the 360's flat tire. It will launch in "Late Summer 2017." Diesel On Diesel's first Android Wear watch, the Diesel On, was announced earlier this year at Baselworld 2017. Hardly any useful information about it has been revealed, besides the fact that it uses a Snapdragon Wear 2100 processor and will have "hundreds of customization options." It looks like it has a digital crown, but we can't be sure. The watch will be available in "Holiday 2017," and will start at $350. Fossil Q Venture/Q Explorist Fossil's first Android Wear watch was released back in 2015, and the company followed up on it with two more in 2016. This year, Fossil is releasing the Q Venture and Q Explorist. Details on these are also incredibly sparse, but we do know both watches will have a Snapdragon Wear 2100 CPU and will be released in the Fall. It seems very likely that both watches have a flat tire display, as companies often try to use black watch faces in promotional material (such as the above image) to hide it. In fact, adjusting the brightness and contrast on the above image does reveal a flat tire. Movado Connect Movado's first Android Wear device, the Movado Connect, definitely looks sleek. It has an edge-to-edge 1.46" 400x400 circular display, a 300mAh battery, Wi-Fi connectivity, and NFC for Android Pay. However, it is worth noting that the Connect lacks a speaker, LTE, GPS, and a heart rate sensor. The watch will be available in Fall 2017, starting at $495. Hugo Boss Touch Another sleek Android Wear watch announced this year is the Hugo Boss Touch, priced at $395.¬†The specifications are identical to the Movado Connect - Wear 2100 CPU, 300mAh battery, 1.46" 400x400 circular display, and Wi-Fi/NFC connectivity. Just like the Connect, it's missing a speaker, LTE, GPS, and a heart rate sensor. You'll be able to buy it this Fall. Tommy Hilfiger TH24/7You This watch wins the award for the worst smartwatch name, but it seems to be pretty good at everything else. It has a Wear 2100 processor, a 1.4" circular 400x400 display, and a 300mAh battery. The watch does have Wi-Fi and NFC support, but lacks a speaker, LTE, GPS, and a heart rate sensor. You'll be able to buy the TH24/7You in the Fall for $299 - making it one of the more competitively-priced options on this list. ZTE Quartz At $192, the ZTE Quartz is¬†the least expensive watch on this list, barely beating out the Misfit Vapor. Currently exclusive to T-Mobile, the Quartz has a Wear 2100 CPU, 1.4" 400x400 circular display, and IP67 water resistance. It supports Wi-Fi, 3G, and GPS connectivity, but no NFC. There's also no heart rate sensor on the Quartz, but it does have the largest battery of any watch on this list at 500mAh. The carrier exclusivity is a bit of a bummer, but maybe we'll see an unlocked model show up in the future. Verizon Wear24 Verizon surprised everyone when it announced an LTE-capable Android Wear watch alongside the LG Watch Sport, undercutting the latter device in the process. The Wear24 has all the features of the Watch Sport, except GPS and a heart rate sensor (and possibly a speaker, Verizon hasn't confirmed that). When the Wear24 goes on sale, you'll be able to buy it for $349 outright or $300 on a two-year contract. It also remains to be seen how bulky the watch will be - that was definitely a problem for the Watch Sport, and Verizon hasn't released any photos. Conclusion We're starting to see more and more actual watch companies invest in Android Wear, which I see as a good thing for the platform.¬†Up until now, Android Wear has largely only been used by tech enthusiasts. I've seen plenty of people with Apple Watches (not as many as Apple would like, but still), but hardly anyone with Android Wear devices. Android Wear 2.0 in general is a bit of a mixed bag. While I personally don't mind the changes as much, others are much less happy about it, and for valid reasons. We'll have to see where the platform goes in the coming months (and years), but there is no shortage of watches to choose from.

Such a shame. Corbin Davenport That one was released in 2016. Dimitris Kanellopoulos Right. Sorry Raven ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà It might also have been released late 2016, but it is a shame that you did not include the Asus ZenWatch 3 in this comparison. I think it is one of the best Wear 2100 based smart watches currently available and at only $209 it is a steal compared to some of the ones listed here. I am loving mine. Tucker Sferro scrolling down the list, I am amazed at the prices. I loved my Moto 360 1st gen, I paid $100 for it on Craigslist. That's exactly what it's worth. You know why? The battery died after about 18 months and it's now a brick. The general public doesnt want to pay more than $150 for a secondary "cell phone-like" piece of hardware that only lasts 2 years, period. Smartwatches will NEVER take off until the cost point drops dramatically. This is the same thing that e-readers went through, until Amazon stepped up to the plate and brought the costs dow. Thomas Paulsen A fellow Moto 360 1st gen user here with a dead battery. I paid top dollar and it burned me so much that I am holding back from another purchase. The only reasons that I would reconsider are being able to open smart locks with NFC, robust assistant voice control ("open garage door"), broader Android Pay availability and - of course - a moderate price because we all know gadgets become obsolete fast. Tucker Sferro I found an article online that shows you how to replace the battery ($15), but it involved cracking the plastic off the back of the 360, etc. I would also be unhappy if I paid full price. Thomas Paulsen This video was posted two months ago and details the battery swap: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1as_h5jnBM Lazyboy0172 Oh I am going to be very sad when my battery dies. I've had my 360 since september 2014 and have no battery problems so far, but I'll be very sad to lose it. That's really the only thing that will get me to replace it though, because right now the thought of spending $300+ on something newer with the only real difference being that it looks better does not make sense to me. And I think that's the problem with the market right now- the price points just aren't there between manufacturers and consumers. Consumers do not want to supplement their $500 phone with a $400 watch, and then have to replace that watch every couple years. But no manufacturer can afford to sell a nice looking watch at <$150 and then also not have any repeat customers for 3+ years. Tucker Sferro you bring up a good point, that manufacturers are unable to bring the costs down to a more attractive level, which is why someone like Amazon (shudders) might be able to lower the cost with a Fire watch, or something like that. Oh boy, ads on my watch?! I just threw up on myself. brkshr Replacing the battery costs about $10 and 20 minutes. Kyle R Krcmaric I just want to have Android Wear at or below $150 on a device that supports Android Pay. GreatNews You forgot to include the all new ZTE Quartz https://www.t-mobile.com/internet-device/zte-quartz Corbin Davenport You're right, I'll be adding it shortly. Rorison Meadows II I need a camera on a decent sized one for video calling and photos. Come on people! marcusmarcus2 Here you go :) http://www.doki.com/ Daniel Nava Best Buy has the LG Watch Style for $170 right now. I picked one up and could not be happier with it. I just wanted a nice looking basic Android Wear watch under $200 and I got it. Matt It's a shame that Wear 2.0 is so bad. Roy ?WHY kamiller42 Oh. Where do I begin? 1. The watch is no longer an extension of the phone. This hurts the convenience of using the watch. 2. Apps that used to work no longer. Most times, permissions have to be granted again. Other times, the watch app has lost connectivity with the phone. 3. Notifications which used to appear don't. 4. It's slower than previous versions. 5. Theater mode in 1 click, 1 swipe, and 2 taps vs 2 clicks. 6. DnD no longer works. Why? Because Google wants the watch to act as an independent device. DnD on watch and phone are not connected. A handful of people say that's great, but the situations they bring up are edge cases. Most people, when they say "Do not disturb me" means do not disturb me at all. 7. I have not figured out to answer the phone from the watch. The only option I see is to refuse call. Used to be simple. Swipe right to answer. Swipe left to refuse. Roy 1. It's great. Only need good sync. 2. Wich apps? 3. Why not? All the reviews says it's work. 4. Mmm for sure now they need to upgrade the hardware for independent os. 5. What's for? 6. You right about that. 7. I didn't hear about that. So if I can Make a summary no everything work flawless so it's good that I didn't buy one just yet but it doesn't mean that Android Wear 2.0 not in good Direction. I hated the first version. Matt Why is that a shame or why is it bad? Michael Maggard ZTE Quartz came out in 2017, has Android Wear 2.0, and is under US$200. https://www.t-mobile.com/internet-device/zte-quartz Corbin Davenport Yep, I'll be adding it to the post shortly. Derik Taylor Also, the ZTE Quartz does have GPS. In the description, you said it doesn't. :| (I have it, which is the only reason I knew that.) marcusmarcus2 The discription also says it has NFC but I cannot see that it does on the T mobile website or the ZTE website. Derik Taylor Huh...didn't notice that. No NFC. :( Not that I planned on using it anyway, but still would have been nice as an option. abqnm I see it's on there now. There's a bit of an error though. In the blurb for it, it says there IS NFC but NO GPS. It's the other way around. It HAS GPS and NO NFC. The entry in the table is correct though. Thanks for this post. It's a great way to compare at a glance. Corbin Davenport Yep, some info got mixed when I was adding the Quartz and Wear24 at the same time. Both the table and the article text should be correct now. abqnm Thanks, but it's not quite correct still. The Quartz description now says but no GPS, LTE, or NFC It does have GPS, but not LTE or NFC. marcusmarcus2 Third time's a charm http://s2.quickmeme.com/img/1a/1ab37c4fc16eae0cf8505ad03c1652fea7659118ab91a6fa386c4e1e514266aa.jpg Corbin Davenport I clearly can't write today. Fixed! abqnm Haha no worries. We've all been there. marcusmarcus2 https://www.zteusa.com/zte-quartz "500 mAh" Dang, it has the largest battery compared to those listed and it still only has "up to 36 hours of battery life per charge" Kyle Gospodnetich Are you guys ever going to talk about the joke that is the Android Wear 2.0 OTAs? Most watches don't even have it yet, and Google completely backed down on their 'fast update, all at once' promise. Dan W agreed. i was hoping that AP would hold Google's feet to the fire on the 2.0 updates. they've been a tragic reminder of how little Google and its partners care about timely updates. Captain On! It's hard to forget, but updates aren't solely on Google. Manufacturers and driver support can hold software updates back regardless of Google trying to shove it out the door. EcE But since there was such promise, shouldn't have Google "certified" the watches somehow? Ensuring that the updates can be pushed timely? kamiller42 Google is doing you a favor. AW 2.0 is a work in progress. Its flow is not as fast and fluid as previous. me me Agreed, I tried the Developer Preview, Watch become unusable. Ambition >> specifications. Carson Saldanha When did they say "fast update, all at once" Mayoo Honorable mention to one of the longest tags section I've seen on AP https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4be9fae6b2e3863638bc20bd2881a3021302f2677608ddc958771313cae23baf.png PJ Anderson The LG Watch Style has a speaker? David Ruddock It doesn't, the table has been corrected. IcerC The Verizon Wear24 comes out in less than a week right? Add that one. tu3218 Has Verizon even announced a date yet? Still nothing on their website. Rashad May 11 tu3218 Where did you see that? Rashad I added the link afterwards. tu3218 Good deal. Although I'm really still waiting for the gear S3. But we all know how that's going for Verizon. Corbin Davenport Yeah, I'll add that one as well. YaKillaCJ The messed up part is the Misfit Vapor is the clear winner in terms of aesthetics and specs when not factoring price. Yet it's priced ridiculously competitive. I think I will get it to upgrade my Moto 360 1st Gen. victor sanchez same here. jawsnnn It will probably have some glaring flaw when it comes out. That has been the pattern for Android Wear devices so far: Announcement,Excitement,Dashed hopes and dreams. 005 anyone know if Misfit vapor has speaker if that has speaker that seals the deal all the way i can leave with out NFC for that price its hands down the best if only had spaker Corbin Davenport I found no mention of a speaker anywhere. 005 thanks hope they do because Huawei Watch 2 Classic went way down in design not sure what the heck happen ObligatoryEscapments It has 5ATM water resistance. In the Android Wear world, that means no speaker. (See: Casio, Nixon, Polar. All speakerless) i_say_uuhhh That Movado looks amazing, just wish it had a speaker and LTE. skillfulshoe Don't be fooled by that picture, it doesn't have an edge to edge screen. Not sure how AP missed that. https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/3/24/15052504/movado-android-wear-watch-connect-baselworld-2017 Roy THE CPU IS CRAP. marcusmarcus2 Really? I thought it was silicon. Roy Really why 28nm?! Stevie_Wonder The Misfit will probably be my first smartwatch. Might have some shortcomings, for example the lacking of NFC, but I don't think I will really need that since Android Pay isn't even launched here. Not sure if a speaker is really useful. And a question for the smartwatch users. My provider doesn't support a second sim so can't use the LTE option, but how useful is it and do you use it a lot? Will it connect through Bluetooth with your phone first and if that fails use LTE to connect? ObligatoryEscapments Casio is even stingier than Fossil with specs, but it's very surprising to hear that they've abandoned their custom SoC from the WSD-10 to use the Qualcomm. Also, I think it's a safe assumption the Verizon/Quanta Wear24 has a speaker. It's an LTE watch that makes phone calls. haberd I would love to see dimensions added. My major problem with this crop is they are too bulky for constant wear bƒÅbƒÅ ghan≈´j Full spec sheet for all Android Wear watches here! https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lbKhNnFBARrT5TVo3bkyp1UzT0S5Iahy3W9dAQf_sfc/edit#gid=0 ethd "The award for the longest smartwatch name goes to the TAG Heuer Connected Modular 45. This watch has an Intel Atom Z34XX processor (the same one the Casio watch uses), 1.39" 400x400 circular display, 410mAh battery, and speaker." I think you meant that it has the same processor the New Balance one uses. Your table and the article both say that the Casio Pro Trek uses a SDW2100. JD Seeing how Google Treats Android Wear. That's a big list of Casualties to add to the already long list of casualties. FlyOnTheWall No Polar M600? Corbin Davenport That was released last year. Akshdeep For ZTE Quartz in the table you have mentioned screen size as 1.4 and 400x400 but below you have written 1.3 and 480x480. Please make correction. Corbin Davenport Thanks, it has been fixed. Carson Saldanha The table says the LG Watch Style has a speaker, but I'm pretty sure it doesn't. Might wanna fix that ;) jmwils3 Haven't gotten any final news from Verizon, as the csms don't have the information, but the NFC chip on the wear24 don't seem to be active and no Android pay present, at least currently. Who knows if an update will activate them by official launch day, but the fact the original verizon article has been edited to remove references to NFC and the product page is gone isn't all that encouraging. Iagoba Apellaniz Compass? I want to see the ability to point to north Richard Markert I have both gens of 360, but I'm going to get a Gear S3 Classic for my next smartwatch. Not going to do another Wear watch. lcasale Can't even buy the LG Sport. It's been sold out on the Google Store and Verizon has pushed back the pre-ordered twice now (by two months). I'm expecting them to miss the latest 5/11 ship date as well. b_boogey_xl I think I'll go with the Huawei Watch 2 Classic. The only knock I have with it is, no LTE (not a deal breaker but‚Ä¶) and I wish they left off those notches that do nothing for a digital watch üôÑ. Don't really care for a digital crown since it doesn't have a greater function like it does on the Apple Watch, it just sounds like a "me too" feature. Now just to wait for the price to drop since everyone hates it‚Ä¶ üòä. peterfares You sure the Wear24 doesn't have GPS? I think it does. OrangeSweater Are you sure the Misfit Vapor has LTE? The only thing I see listed on the product page is Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity. It seems odd that it would include LTE when it is so much cheaper than what is available from other companies.
